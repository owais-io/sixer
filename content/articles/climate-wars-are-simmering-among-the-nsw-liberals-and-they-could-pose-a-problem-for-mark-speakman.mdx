  The never-ending war within the Coalition over energy policy and climate
  targets appears to have infected the New South Wales Liberals as they struggle
  to restore the administration of their branch and get traction with voters.
  It’s bad news for the NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, whose hold on the
  leadership is being increasingly questioned. Until now, the main battleground
  for the renewed climate wars has been Canberra, where the right of the Liberal
  party and the Nationals from Queensland – aided and abetted by the US
  president, Donald Trump – have used every opportunity to foment discontent.
  The federal Coalition leader, Sussan Ley, has promised to review the
  Coalition’s energy policy, but there will be no easy answers. She will need to
  juggle the demands of MPs such as Nationals senator Matt Canavan and Liberal
  Andrew Hastie that she drop the net zero target with the views of her city
  MPs, who know they could go the way of their former colleagues who lost seats
  to teal independents. Let alone doing the right thing for the planet. For the
  NSW Coalition, energy policy has been an area of mostly bipartisan agreement –
  until now. In 2020, the then energy minister Matt Kean, a Liberal who now
  chairs the Climate Change Authority, released the energy roadmap that showed
  how NSW would meet its objective to deliver a 70% cut in emissions by 2035
  compared to 2005 levels, and net zero by 2050. It was supported by both sides.
  But last week the first signs of an unravelling emerged. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email Just before the NSW parliament rose for a long break, the Liberal
  MP for Goulburn, Wendy Tuckerman, resigned from the shadow ministry over her
  own party’s failure to listen to her concerns about windfarms. Ostensibly, it
  was over a failure of the leadership to consult on the electricity
  infrastructure bill, which the government said was urgent. The bill gave the
  energy minister, Penny Sharpe, the power to fast-track investments in
  synchronous condensers, which are urgently needed for grid stability.
  According to her office, it did no more than broaden the definition of
  priority infrastructure to ensure investments in this critical infrastructure
  by the privately owned electricity distributors could proceed. Whether it did
  more than that depends on who you ask. The Minns government says it doesn’t
  alter the planning and consultation process for major infrastructure such as
  transmission lines. But it was a bridge too far for Tuckerman, whose
  electorate is part of a renewable energy zone and has seen dozens of projects
  proposed. “I have had countless calls, emails and comments from community
  members that feel like they have just been kicked while they are down. They
  are bearing the brunt of poor planning and … the government’s lack of
  accountability. They are not being listened to,” she said. “I can no longer in
  good conscience be a part of a process that sidelines the voices of
  constituents and regional communities, or which undermines my ability to
  represent the people that put me here.” There’s no doubt that Tuckerman’s
  electorate is concerned about the scale of windfarm development – as is the
  Orana region near Dubbo. But the concerns have been turbocharged and taken to
  a wider audience by the Daily Telegraph, which has run no fewer than five
  stories in the space of two weeks about the harm that windfarms were causing
  farmers in Tuckerman’s electorate. These were then amplified across other News
  Corp platforms including news.com.au and Sky News, who interviewed the
  Telegraph journalists about their coverage, and by 2GB. At the same time, the
  rightwing advocacy group Advance has announced a campaign to kill off
  “weakling” Liberals who support the net zero climate target. Advance members
  are being bombarded with emails seeking donations, with the aim to raise
  $450,000 before the end of August. Most of Advance’s efforts seem focused on
  the federal Liberals, but the anti-net zero sentiment has reached the NSW
  Nationals, at least in the grassroots party. At their conference in June in
  Coffs Harbour, they voted to drop support for net zero. The problem for
  Speakman is that the climate issue could quickly become a wedge that will be
  used by the right to further fuel the leadership speculation that is already
  bubbling. Speakman is undoubtedly under pressure. There’s no immediate
  appetite to replace him among the dominant moderate faction from which he
  comes. But there is concern about a lack of cut-through, particularly as a
  recent Resolve poll in July in the Sydney Morning Herald showed Labor with a
  commanding primary vote lead over the Coalition of 38% (up five points on the
  last result in April) to 32% (down four), with the Greens up two to 13%. The
  Poll Bludger estimated this would imply a two-party Labor lead of at least
  57-43, compared with 54.3-45.7 at the March 2023 election. A 5% swing would
  see the Liberals lose another five seats and condemn them to a further two
  terms of opposition. “People are starting to worry about saving the
  furniture,” one Liberal said. The Kiama byelection on 13 September will be a
  test for Speakman. If he puts in a good showing, the troops might calm down.
  But with an election due in March 2027, the window for leadership bloodletting
  is fast approaching. Both sides were claiming underdog status in the South
  Coast seat, which was most recently held by the Liberal turned Independent
  Gareth Ward who resigned after being convicted of rape. Ward enjoyed enormous
  personal support even after the charges were laid, so it’s difficult to say
  whether voters will chose to punish the Liberals or follow the conventional
  wisdom of byelections and give the government of the day a good kick. In the
  meantime, the climate wars are simmering again and they’ve reached the doors
  of Macquarie Street. A NSW parliamentary committee is due to release a report
  on the renewable energy zones and their impact on rural communities as early
  as next week. It will provide an opportunity for the opponents of net zero to
  target more “weakling” Liberals – and it will test out Speakman’s skill in
  managing a difficult issue for his troops.
