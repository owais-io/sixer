  The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has hit back at Donald
  Trump’s campaign against the South American country’s judiciary, claiming the
  US president would be put on trial in Brazil had the January 6 US Capitol
  attacks taken place there. Trump has triggered what some experts call the
  greatest ever diplomatic rupture between the US and Brazil by slapping 50%
  tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioning a supreme court judge in an
  attempt to help his far-right ally, ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, avoid prison
  for allegedly trying to stage a coup after he lost the 2022 election to Lula.
  Bolsonaro faces a four-decade jail sentence when the supreme court announces
  its verdict in the coming weeks – proceedings Trump has called a “witch-hunt”
  and has urged Brazilian authorities to halt. On Wednesday, as Lula announced a
  rescue package for companies affected by Trump’s tariffs, Brazil’s leftwing
  president went on the counterattack against US attempts to pressure the five
  supreme court judges who will decide the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other
  alleged co-conspirators. “What we are doing is something that only happens in
  democratic countries – judging someone based on evidence collected from
  witnesses and with complete presumption of innocence. This is democracy raised
  to the nth power … They are being judged based on the plea bargains and
  statements given by from people who took part in the coup attempt,” Lula said
  at an event in the capital Brasília. “And I’ve said to President Trump: If
  what happened in the Capitol had happened in Brazil, he would be put on trial
  here in Brazil too,” Lula added, rejecting the idea that there was anything
  “arbitrary” about Bolsonaro’s trial. Lula also rejected US criticism of the
  human rights situation in Brazil after the state department used its annual
  human rights report on Tuesday to accuse his government of undermining
  democratic debate and “suppressing the speech of supporters of former
  president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians”. Lula
  said: “There was really no reason to hit Brazil with tariffs and nor will we
  accept being told that we don’t respect human rights here in Brazil. “Every
  time that our American friends decide to pick a fight with someone, they try
  to make the people they want to fight with look like demons,” Lula added,
  lamenting how the 201-year-old diplomatic relationship between the two
  countries was “being thrown away”. Lula urged Brazilians not to fear the
  pressure campaign being waged by Trump, who avoided charges over his attempt
  to overturn the 2020 election after his election last year. One of Trump’s
  first acts as president was to issue “full, complete and unconditional”
  presidential pardons for about 1,500 people involved in the January 6 storming
  of Congress. In Brazil, 141 people are serving prison sentences for taking
  part in the 8 January 2023 rightwing riots in Brasília, which were allegedly
  part of Bolsonaro’s coup plot. “We shouldn’t be scared and anxious or get all
  excited whenever a crisis comes along. Crises exist for us to create new
  things. Humanity has created great things … in times of crisis,” Lula said.
