  Neil Young has released a new song lambasting Donald Trump, entitled Big
  Crime. The Canadian-American rocker has long been a critic of the US
  president, suing him (but later dropping the lawsuit) over the use of his
  songs at campaign rallies and calling him “the worst president in the history
  of our great country”. He has stepped up that criticism in the new song, which
  has been posted to Young’s YouTube channel. Featuring his backing band the
  Chrome Hearts, it was recorded during a sound check at a concert on Chicago’s
  Northerly Island. “There’s big crime in DC at the White House,” Young sings in
  the chorus, as a comment on Trump’s previous legal difficulties, as well as a
  sarcastic reference to Trump’s current crackdown on crime in Washington DC.
  Trump declared a “crime emergency” in DC earlier this month, seized control of
  the city’s police force and deployed national guard troops. He claimed the
  move was aimed at “halting the precipitous rise in violent crime”, though in
  January the city’s police department and US attorney Matthew Graves had
  announced a 30-year low for crime there. “Don’t need no fascist rules / don’t
  want no fascist schools / don’t want soldiers walking on the streets,” Young
  sings. “Got to get the fascists out / got to clean the White House out … no
  more money to the fascists, the billionaire fascists”. Riffing on Trump’s
  “make America great again” slogan, Young adds: “No more great again.” Young
  has previously criticised Trump in song, updating his 2006 song Lookin’ for a
  Leader in 2020 to include lyrics about him. “America has a leader building
  walls around our house / Who don’t know Black lives matter and we got to vote
  him out,” Young sang, characterising Trump as “scared of his own shadow”. The
  2006 original was targeted at then-president George W Bush, calling for
  “someone who’s straight and strong / to lead us from desolation and a broken
  world gone wrong”, and mooting Barack Obama for the task. It was included on
  the album Living With War, on which Young criticised Bush in the plainest
  terms possible with the song Let’s Impeach the President. Trump used Young’s
  song Rockin’ in the Free World when announcing he was running for president in
  2015 – possibly taking its anthemic chorus at face value rather than
  understanding the ironic meaning of a song charting social collapse during the
  Reagan era. Young said he supported Bernie Sanders for president and Trump
  dropped the use of the song, saying he “didn’t love it anyway”. But it
  reappeared on the playlist at a 2020 rally along with another Young song,
  Devil’s Sidewalk. Young sued Trump over the use, with the lawsuit stating that
  Young “cannot allow his music to be used as a ‘theme song’ for a divisive,
  un-American campaign of ignorance and hate”. Young later voluntarily dismissed
  the lawsuit. Young, who became a dual US-Canadian citizen in 2020 and called
  Trump “a disgrace to my country” that year, expressed worry earlier in 2025
  that his criticism of Trump would mean he would not be allowed back into the
  US. “When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J Trump, I may
  be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on
  a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,” he wrote on his website.
