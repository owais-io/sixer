  New season, same old Arsenal? On an evening when Viktor Gyökeres was meant to
  announce himself as the solution to all of Mikel Arteta’s problems, instead it
  was a figure from Arsenal’s past who stole the show. At £72m – £8m more than
  they may end up paying for the Sweden striker – Nicolas Pépé was an expensive
  Arsenal signing, a few months before Arteta replaced Unai Emery in 2019. Most
  of the fans who packed out the Emirates Stadium for this pre-season friendly
  will not have many fond memories of the Ivory Coast international’s spell in
  north London, but he clearly had a point to prove here. Pépé’s early goal and
  strikes from Karl Etta Eyong and the former Tottenham loanee Arnaut Danjuma
  sealed an impressive win for Villarreal, and left Arteta with plenty of
  questions to resolve before Arsenal’s opening game of the season next weekend
  against Manchester United. Gyökeres, who is the headline act of a spending
  spree that could exceed £200m, looked short of match fitness as he toiled up
  front for 62 minutes. Only the introduction of the 15‑year‑old Max Dowman for
  his first senior appearance at the Emirates Stadium could lift the mood as he
  won a penalty that allowed Martin Ødegaard to make the scoreline more
  respectable. But there were more reasons to be fearful for Arsenal’s fans as
  they aim to improve on finishing as Premier League runners-up for a third
  successive season. There had been a sense of anticipation in the late summer
  air as they queued patiently at the club shop before kick‑off, with several
  already sporting Gyökeres’s new replica No 14 shirt. Having made his debut
  last week as a substitute against Spurs in their 1-0 defeat in Hong Kong, the
  Sweden striker is still playing catch‑up having stayed away from pre-season
  with Sporting as he attempted to force through his move. But he was included
  in a strong starting lineup, with Ethan Nwaneri deputising for Ødegaard
  alongside the new signing Christian Nørgaard and Mikel Merino in midfield. The
  match programme featured pictures of all six of Arsenal’s summer arrivals on
  the cover, with Martín Zubimendi, Cristhian Mosquera, Noni Madueke and Kepa
  Arrizabalaga on the bench. Arteta used his programme notes to express his
  belief they “will add quality and depth to the squad, which is what we are
  going to need throughout the season”. Arteta added: “We know what our targets
  are and what we want to achieve this season – there is a big belief in our
  ability to achieve that. We have been very, very close the last few seasons
  and the whole team is going to determine whether we achieve that or not.” It
  was Nwaneri, who has signed a new contract this summer, who caught the eye
  early on. A cross from Merino that was meant for the forehead of Gyökeres
  instead found Bukayo Saka at the back post and he could not direct the ball on
  target. But with only Gabriel Magalhães missing from his first-choice back
  four, Arteta will be concerned with how easily Villarreal established a 2-0
  lead. Pépé, who joined Villarreal last year on a free transfer and is set to
  be joined by the former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey after he agreed an
  initial one-year deal, was unlucky when his shot came back off the post before
  he eventually forced the ball past David Raya when Arsenal failed to clear.
  The Spaniard was left fuming with his defence when Etta Eyong doubled the
  Spanish side’s lead just after the half-hour, although Nørgaard immediately
  pulled one back from a corner. Like last season when they struggled from a
  lack of creativity, that seemed to be Arsenal’s best chance of scoring as
  Gyökeres was forced to live off scraps before the break. Mosquera and
  Zubimendi were summoned for the second half and there was an immediate
  improvement. Gyökeres finally had a sight of goal when played in by Merino but
  his shot was well saved by Luiz Júnior. It needed Dowman, who has been hailed
  as a “special talent” by Arteta despite his tender years, to save some face
  after Danjuma had raced clear to make it 3-1, although Madueke missed the
  decisive penalty in a post‑match shootout. “Max is moving so fast – even last
  year when he was training with us, he was doing these kind of things and now
  he is doing them in the games,” Arteta said. “The efficiency he shows in every
  attacking action is incredible and he deserves more chances.” On Gyökeres,
  Arteta said: “Every day in training he is getting a really good feeling and
  connection with all the other players who are going to help him. He hasn’t
  trained for a team for two months and, on Saturday, he will take another step
  and be in a very good position.”
