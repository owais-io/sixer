  Elouise Eftos: Australia’s First Attractive Comedian review – fabulously
  provocative jokes

  Can you be funny and good-looking? You’d think the question barely needs
  asking – but Elouise Eftos has done so, and received quite the reaction. She
  makes a stellar fringe debut with Australia’s First Attractive Comedian, a
  tongue-in-cheek title some have treated, by her account, as no laughing
  matter. Should we be surprised the relationship between comedy, feminism and
  sexiness isn’t as resolved as we might have thought? In the space between
  them, the Perth comic makes great stacks of hay here, in a show premised on
  her extreme hotness. She chats to an audience member; we cut away to the
  erotic Elouise Eftos fantasy unfolding in that person’s head. She demonstrates
  the yawning gulf between herself and “normies”. She jokes about cat-calls, and
  the expulsion from the Beatles of handsome Pete Best. She makes common cause
  with her fellow bombshell, that innocent bank-teller turned patron saint of
  making wives jealous, Dolly Parton’s Jolene. Is it all a hilarious wind-up? Or
  are we to take Eftos’s lofty self-image at face value? The show’s neat trick
  is to be equally funny regardless, or because, of that ambiguity. Either way,
  Eftos has nailed a wickedly amusing and original stage persona, sky-high
  self-regard but charm in spades too, all flashed smiles, tossed hair and
  matter-of-fact superiority to we lesser mortals in her crowd. And, unlike
  beauty, the show is not only skin deep. In its later stages, Eftos keeps
  pushing her ideas – and what we might think about them – into material about
  sex, her body and a final sequence, in character as a malfunctioning
  “femmebot”, that implies some unstated ambiguity about the role she’s choosing
  (or has been forced?) to play. There’s also a questioning routine about the
  act’s feminist credentials, which get sharply challenged by one or two senior
  female comedians – whose shocking correspondence with Eftos is displayed on an
  upstage screen. Impudence – towards her elders, towards the comedy industry at
  large – is a feature of this fabulous provocation of a comedy hour, nipping
  and tucking at our ambivalent relationship with good looks. • At Pleasance
  Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
