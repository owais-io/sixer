  The Russian leadership continued to obfuscate on Wednesday, after European
  leaders and Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin had agreed to a one-on-one
  meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to kickstart peace talks. Sergei Lavrov said
  Moscow did not reject any format for Ukraine peace talks but the Russian
  foreign minister appeared to apply the brakes, saying any leaders’ meeting
  “must be prepared with utmost thoroughness”. On Tuesday, a Kremlin aide said
  only that Putin was open to the “idea” of “raising the level of
  representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian sides” at a future meeting. The
  White House also announced that Viktor Orbán, the pro-Putin Hungarian prime
  minister, and Trump had discussed the possibility of talks being held in
  Budapest. As with the Kremlin, there was no apparent confirmation of this
  conversation from the Hungarian side. A war crimes warrant could oblige
  Hungarian authorities to arrest a visiting Putin, but Hungary is withdrawing
  from the international criminal court. Orbán explicitly committing to play
  host could place further unwanted pressure on the Russian ruler from one of
  his few allies to accept the meeting as an inevitability. Austria and
  Switzerland also said they would be ready to host the meeting. Switzerland
  said that during Putin’s visit it could set aside its international criminal
  court obligations. “This has to do with our diplomatic role, with
  international Geneva as [the European] headquarters of the United Nations,”
  said Ignazio Cassis, the Swiss foreign minister. The French president,
  Emmanuel Macron, said Geneva was a potential location for the talks. The
  Austrian chancellor, Christian Stocker, said his country supported any
  initiative leading to a just and lasting peace protecting Ukrainian and
  European security. Donald Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to
  enforce a potential peace deal, tempering a promise to provide Kyiv with
  security guarantees in conjunction with European allies, write Andrew Roth and
  Pjotr Sauer. In a phone interview with Fox News, Trump did however say that
  Washington may be willing to provide air support to Ukraine in order to
  backstop a deal, in what would still be a remarkable shift in his
  administration’s policy on the conflict. Putin opposes Ukraine joining Nato –
  Trump told Fox that “there’ll be some form of security. It can’t be Nato.
  They’re willing to put people on the ground. We’re willing to help them with
  things, especially, probably, if you could talk about by air.” Trump conceded
  that Putin might not want to make a deal after all, saying: “We’re going to
  find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks.” Nato military
  leaders are expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss Ukraine and the way
  forward, a US official and Nato official have told the Reuters news agency.
  The US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gen Dan Caine, chair
  of the US joint chiefs of staff, was expected to teleconference in, but plans
  could still change. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for
  comment. Another Nato official said the alliance’s top military commander,
  Alexus Grynkewich, would brief the leaders on the results of the Alaska
  meeting between Trump and Putin last week. Following Monday’s meeting in
  Washington, Russia launched its biggest air assault in more than a month on
  Ukraine, with 270 drones and 10 missiles fired, the Ukrainian air force said.
  The energy ministry said the strikes caused big fires at energy facilities in
  the central Poltava region, home to Ukraine’s only oil refinery. The governor
  of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, Serhiy Lysak, said Russian shelling killed
  a resident of Nikopol, a frequent target of Moscow’s attacks. A Ukrainian
  drone attack late on Tuesday knocked out power to Russian-controlled areas of
  Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, said the Moscow-installed governor, Yevgeny
  Balitsky. Kyiv maintains control of the region’s main administrative centre
  and its attacks have periodically knocked out electricity in Russian-held
  areas. The illegally occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station was
  unaffected, the plant’s director told Russia’s RIA news agency. The plant
  produces no electricity but needs power for cooling and monitoring systems to
  maintain safety. Russia and Ukraine exchanged more bodies of their war dead,
  the Moscow-run Tass news agency reported on Tuesday, citing a source. Moscow
  handed over the bodies of 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers and had received 19 bodies
  of its own fallen soldiers in return, it was reported. Ukraine appeared to
  confirm the exchange.
