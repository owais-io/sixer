  President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that US colleges would struggle without
  Chinese students, amid a backlash from his base after he suggested he could
  let 600,000 Chinese college students into the country as part of trade talks
  with the economic rival. Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign
  ministry, said on Wednesday that the ministry hoped the US would follow
  through on Trump’s statement welcoming Chinese students and stop the
  “unprovoked harassment, interrogation, and deportation” of Chinese students.
  Denmark’s foreign minister has summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen over
  Danish intelligence reports that US citizens have been conducting covert
  influence operations in Greenland, the ministry said on Wednesday. Public
  broadcaster DR cited unnamed sources as saying the government believed at
  least three US nationals with ties to president Donald Trump’s administration
  had been involved in influence operations aimed at promoting Greenland’s
  secession from Denmark to the United States. “We are aware that foreign actors
  continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of
  Denmark,” foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement. “It is
  therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the
  future of the Kingdom in the time ahead,” Rasmussen said. Neither the
  broadcaster nor the ministry named the individuals flagged in the intelligence
  reports. The US embassy in Copenhagen did not immediately respond to a request
  for comment, Reuters reported. The European Union is aiming to expedite
  legislation to remove all tariffs on US industrial goods by the end of the
  week, a demand made by president Donald Trump before the US will lower its
  duties on the bloc’s automobile exports, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.
  Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. Hello and welcome to the US
  politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the
  latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that president
  Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on goods from India to as much as 50% took
  effect as scheduled on Wednesday, escalating tensions between the world’s two
  largest democracies and strategic partners. A punitive 25% tariff imposed due
  to India’s purchases of Russian oil adds to Trump’s prior 25% tariff on many
  products from India. It takes total duties to as high as 50% for goods such as
  garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and
  chemicals – among the highest imposed by the US and on par with Brazil and
  China. India and the US have held five rounds of discussions since April to
  reach a trade agreement, but differences over the opening up of India’s vast
  farm and dairy sectors, and its purchases of Russian oil led to a breakdown of
  talks. The new tariffs threaten thousands of small exporters and jobs,
  including in prime minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat, Reuters
  reported. An Indian commerce ministry official said on condition of anonymity
  that exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be
  encouraged to diversify to markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle
  East. In other developments: Donald Trump held a televised, three-hour cabinet
  meeting, in which various secretaries seemed to compete to praise him in more
  effusive terms, and he took questions from reporters from partisan outlets.
  Trump told reporters that “I think, maybe in my own mind, I have somebody that
  I like” to take the place of the Federal Reserve governor he is trying to
  force out, Lisa Cook, who is fighting to keep her place. Two reporters for
  pro-Trump outlets offered testimony about crime in Washington DC to support
  the president’s claims. Texas’s redrawn congressional maps have drawn a
  lawsuit from the NAACP, accusing the state of committing a racial gerrymander
  with its maps that strip Black voters of their political power. A
  whistleblower complaint alleges that Elon Musk’s so-called “department of
  government efficiency” (Doge) copied and uploaded the sensitive Social
  Security data of hundreds of millions of Americans to a vulnerable cloud
  server, potentially violating federal privacy laws. One of the Doge staffers
  accused in the complaint is Edward Coristine, whose recent assault in
  Washington DC provided the pretext for Trump’s federal takeover. In a deeply
  partisan press release, Sean Duffy, the former Republican congressman and Fox
  host serving as Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, announced the
  cancellation of $175m in funding for four projects related to what he called
  “California’s High-Speed Rail boondoggle”. The Trump administration retaliated
  against some Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers who signed a letter
  of dissent about the agency’s leadership, the Washington Post reports. A local
  television outlet in Washington DC recorded video of “a full busload of
  National Guard members … picking up trash in Lafayette Park, just outside the
  White House”. Cracker Barrel announced that it is scrapping its new logo, and
  returning to its old one, hours after Donald Trump joined the conservative
  backlash to the change.
