  Jessica Pegula continues to redraw the limits of her career in New York. The
  31-year-old American swept into the last four of the US Open on Tuesday with a
  6-3, 6-3 dismissal of Barbora Krejcikova, becoming the first woman to reach
  back-to-back semi-finals here without dropping a set since Serena Williams
  strung together four straight runs between 2011 and 2014. It was a performance
  of cool authority, built less on fireworks than on persistence and precision.
  Pegula needed only 86 minutes to subdue her opponent, whose serve collapsed
  under pressure with seven double faults and a first-serve percentage barely
  above 40%. Where Krejcikova unravelled, Pegula stayed the course, drawing
  energy from a nearly full Arthur Ashe Stadium that sensed they were watching a
  home contender gather momentum. The match began with Krejcikova missing an
  overhead and donating her first double fault to drop serve at love. Pegula
  extended her lead to 4-2 but stumbled when she missed too many first serves,
  allowing Krejcikova to break back. The reprieve was fleeting. Another double
  fault from the Czech in the following game opened the door and Pegula kicked
  it down, breaking immediately and consolidating to pocket the opening set in
  38 minutes. Time and again Krejcikova’s erratic toss left her scrambling,
  while Pegula punished the second delivery with crisp, flat returns. The
  Czech’s troubles redoubled in the second set. She was broken at love to open,
  mixing in consecutive double faults, as Pegula stamped her authority once
  more. The fourth seed was not flawless – she double-faulted twice in a single
  game at 2-2 and faced a break point – but she steadied herself with a searing
  backhand passing winner before holding for 3-1. When Krejcikova sprayed a
  forehand wide in the next game to drop serve again, Pegula had the insurance
  break she needed. Though she briefly relinquished one of them, the American’s
  control was never in real doubt. Serving for the match at 5-3, she closed it
  out on her second match point when Krejcikova’s forehand sailed past the
  baseline. “I’ve been playing some really good tennis,” Pegula said afterwards.
  “I feel like I’m just really comfortable. We all saw what she did against
  Taylor [Townsend], so I was happy that we’re done.” It was a neat
  encapsulation of her campaign to this point: steady, controlled and efficient.
  She has dropped only 23 games in five matches, conserving her energy while
  others have been dragged into deeper waters. The contrast with her summer form
  was striking. Pegula had suffered early exits in Montreal and Cincinnati after
  a first-round setback at Wimbledon, cutting short one practice session in New
  York the week before the tournament and leaving the grounds in frustration.
  She later credited a reset for helping her to shed the tension. “I went and
  did an escape room with my friends and had two drinks and was like, ‘I need to
  just chill’,” she said. “It’s crazy to look now and think I’m really
  comfortable playing on big courts with the craziest crowds against the big
  players. Ten years ago I never thought I’d be good at this but I guess I am.”
  Long defined by her major quarter-final frustrations – she came up short in
  her first six appearances at that stage – Pegula has now reached consecutive
  semi-finals in New York, proof that last year’s breakthrough was no outlier.
  The 29-year-old Krejcikova, ranked No 62 but a perennial danger, departs with
  credit after a run that included a three-set win over Emma Navarro and an
  extraordinary escape against Townsend, where she saved eight match points. But
  those exertions caught up with her. She had spent more than eight hours on
  court before Tuesday and lacked the legs to sustain rallies against Pegula’s
  metronomic efficiency. For a player who has lifted major championships at
  Roland Garros and Wimbledon – in addition to 10 doubles titles – it was a
  reminder that pedigree alone cannot paper over a failing serve. Pegula, by
  contrast, is finding her stride in what is shaping into one of her finest
  seasons. She has already claimed three titles across three surfaces, joining
  Aryna Sabalenka as the only players to do so, and her 42 victories this year
  place her alongside Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina as the tour’s
  most prolific winners. The statistics and the poise suggest she is ready to
  test herself once more at the business end of a major. Next she will face
  either the world No 1 Sabalenka or Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon
  champion who is unseeded here, for a place in Saturday’s final. Both represent
  daunting obstacles, but Pegula has rarely looked more at ease with the scale
  of the occasion.
