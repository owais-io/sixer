  privilege

  She has glittery nail extensions and her hair scraped back. On a night out,
  she is all fluttering eyelashes and enormous gold platforms. She is not the
  picture of your average Cambridge undergraduate. Which is exactly the point of
  this tremendous solo show in which Jade Franks – remember the name – skewers
  the institution of class privilege in a performance that is as funny as it is
  politically stinging. She writes from experience. A child of working-class
  Liverpool (her relatives are in the front row at my performance, adding to the
  backchatting merriment), Franks is employed at a call centre when inspiration
  strikes. She was always good at school and full of ambition – why shouldn’t
  she apply to Oxbridge? It is a mere detail that she has to work out where
  Oxbridge is. She is not easily deterred. One outreach programme later, she is
  on her way south, moving to Cambridge early to get set up with a cleaning job.
  What follows in Tatenda Shamiso’s razor-sharp production is a culture-clash
  comedy in the tradition of Pygmalion and Educating Rita (what I’d give to see
  Franks star in Willy Russell’s play). Her deadpan wit sustains the
  performance, jokes lining up with jokes by the line, but what drives it all is
  deep rage. Yes, there are the gags about men who wear jumpers over their
  shoulders, the arcane hierarchy of schools and the endless skiing holidays.
  But for all the absurdity of ruling-class behaviour, it is not funny to be
  sniggered at, patronised and demeaned, to have to make a secret of earning a
  wage and to hear your accent being parroted back to you. More than that, some
  of the students she meets, blind to their privilege, revelling in their
  ignorance, will go on to be politicians, even prime ministers, making
  decisions about people of whom they know little and could care less. In that,
  Eat the Rich drills deeper than just one woman’s story of exclusion. Rather,
  it is a damning portrait of a dysfunctional social order. Change is long
  overdue, but at least with Franks leading the rallying cry, this revolution
  will be a right good laugh. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25
  August. • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
