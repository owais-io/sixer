  A senior journalist at the ABC has tendered his resignation two months after
  the public broadcaster’s Media Watch program raised potential
  conflict-of-interest concerns over a press junket. Andrew Greene has been
  defence correspondent for the past 10 years since joining the ABC in 2010. In
  June, the ABC confirmed it was investigating “serious allegations” that Greene
  filed a story about a German shipbuilder, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, without
  disclosing that he had travelled to Germany courtesy of the company, which was
  hoping to win lucrative Australian navy contracts. It followed a Media Watch
  program that revealed Greene filed a story for ABC radio’s The World Today
  about how business was booming at German shipyards. The report, which has
  since been taken down, allegedly failed to disclose that the journalist had
  been a guest of the defence company. As a public broadcaster, the ABC does not
  generally accept travel paid for by the subject of the report as it could pose
  a potential conflict of interest. Staff were informed by the development in an
  internal email, seen by Guardian Australia, from Canberra bureau chief David
  Lipson on Monday evening. “I want to let you know that Andrew Greene has
  resigned from the ABC,” the email read. “We thank Andrew for the great
  contribution he has made to the ABC and to audiences, including his excellent
  reporting as national security and defence reporter, and wish him all the
  best. “The ABC maintains the importance of upholding its editorial and other
  policies.” In June, the ABC said the allegations were “serious” and “any such
  behaviour, if proven, would be unacceptable and could constitute misconduct”.
  Greene’s report, aired on 11 June, said “across northern Germany, shipyards
  are at capacity as military orders ramp up. Rising global strategic tensions
  mean business is booming”. He had not filed a story since 12 June. According
  to Media Watch, the ABC was unaware Greene had travelled to Germany at all. He
  filed the story when he returned from personal leave. The same international
  press junket was taken by the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald’s Matthew
  Knott, who is the foreign affairs and national security correspondent. Knott’s
  report disclosed that he “visited Germany courtesy of TKMS [ThyssenKrupp
  Marine Systems]”. This month, the Australian government confirmed Japan’s
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had beaten its German rival to the contract to
  build Australia’s new fleet of warships, with the Commonwealth to spend $10bn
  over a decade to buy three Mogami-class frigates. German firm TKMS –
  previously branded as ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems – had been considered for
  the deal, but its Meko A-200 vessel was considered second best to the Japanese
  model, including over concerns about the timeline for delivery and putting the
  ships into service. Defence correspondents had been keeping a close eye on
  developments. The ABC did approve another trip Greene took last year hosted by
  the Foreign Press Center Japan, which is a privately funded non-profit, and he
  filed three reports. A spokesperson for the ABC did not respond to a question
  over whether Greene’s resignation was related to the Media Watch reports.
  Greene was approached for comment.
