  The Bell hotel in Epping has seen a lot since it was built in the 16th century
  as a coaching inn, serving travellers passing through the historic Essex
  market town and on to London, 15 miles to the south-west. This has long been a
  place that bustled with outsiders, though they have not always been welcome –
  the small green common opposite was once named after a beacon that local
  stories say was built to warn of invasion. Though now wrapped in ugly 1960s
  extensions that have stripped it of anything approaching charm, the unassuming
  building – close to agricultural land and a cricket pitch – is an unlikely
  place to spark a potential political crisis. That is what the government may
  be facing, however, after the high court ruled this week that the Home
  Office’s use of the Bell hotel to house asylum seekers breached planning laws.
  Epping Forest district council had challenged the government after the hotel
  became a flashpoint for anti-refugee protests, after an Ethiopian man who had
  been placed there was arrested and charged over the alleged sexual assault of
  a 14-year-old girl. Local protesters and the Conservative-led council are
  jubilant but the implications of ousting the hotel’s 140 male residents to as
  yet unknown locations could be far more widespread. Dozens of local
  authorities, some of which have also been the focus of protests, are
  considering similar legal challenges, which could throw the government’s
  entire asylum project into disarray and which one insider admitted this week
  has left the Home Office “reeling”. This case may turn on planning law but
  there are plenty who see this as a much bigger victory, after a febrile summer
  in which thousands of people again have crossed the Channel in small boats,
  anti-migrant protests have taken place in more than 40 locations, and
  nationalistic and anti-refugee rhetoric has been embraced by politicians
  across the spectrum and amplified by sections of the media. There has not been
  widespread rioting of the kind that occurred last summer, sparked by the
  murder of three girls at a dance class in Southport and false rumours that the
  perpetrator was a Muslim asylum seeker. But as communities braced for further
  widespread protests this weekend, a campaign to raise the flags of St George
  and the union jack across the country gathered pace, declaring as patriotism
  what many others have experienced in their villages or streets as clear
  intimidation. According to the anti-extremist groups Hope Not Hate and Stand
  Up to Racism, the apparently spontaneous campaign has in fact been organised
  by well-known far-right figures. “We are in a dangerous moment,” says Lewis
  Nielsen, an anti-fascist officer at Stand Up to Racism. In the context of
  increased far-right protests and encouraging political rhetoric, he says, “the
  ‘Operation Raise the Colours’ was never about flags, it’s about giving
  confidence to racists and fascists to target refugees and migrants”.
  Saturday’s protests largely passed without incident. While demonstrators and
  police clashed in places, there were not the scenes of civil unrest from last
  summer. However, refugee and even minority communities are experiencing real
  consequences, illustrated by countless small but terrifying incidents. In
  Redcar, North Yorkshire, a black man filmed playing with his white
  granddaughters has been racially abused and falsely called a paedophile after
  the short video clip was amplified online by the far-right activist Tommy
  Robinson. In east Belfast, a small group of vigilantes have been seeking out
  dark-skinned men to shout abuse at or demand to see their identity documents.
  Writing in the Guardian on Friday, the Refugee Council’s chief executive,
  Enver Solomon, said some food banks that previously served all in need were
  now turning away perceived “foreigners”. He also described meeting an African
  man in his 60s in north-east England who had been attacked by a group of men –
  his arm was broken – and was terrified of leaving his accommodation. This was
  shortly after Keir Starmer said tough curbs on immigration were needed to
  prevent Britain becoming an “island of strangers”. Solomon wrote: “Those who
  have worked with refugees for decades tell me they have never known a time
  when the hostility has been so strong and the environment so toxic.” Other
  refugee charities have had to install safe rooms or even close their offices
  in response to death threats and intimidation. Starmer has since said he
  “deeply regrets” his “island of strangers” remark, but there has been little
  sign otherwise of a rollback of the rhetoric. This week his spokesperson
  offered an apparent endorsement of the flag-raising campaign, describing the
  prime minister as a “patriot” who believed people should “absolutely” fly
  flags. Meanwhile, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has said women are
  afraid to walk in parks for fear of being harassed by refugee men “lurking in
  bushes”. The shadow minister Robert Jenrick, seen as a potential successor as
  party leader, has been pictured at anti-migrant rallies attended by known
  members of the far right, and attaching a flag to a lamp-post in defiance of
  “Britain-hating” councils who have asked for them not to be attached to street
  infrastructure. The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, called for widespread
  protests outside other hotels housing new arrivals. Paul Jackson, a professor
  of history at the University of Northampton whose work includes a focus on
  far-right extremism, says: “What I find quite concerning is that it’s creating
  an opportunity for the far right to grow. We’ve seen Labour politicians be
  supportive in principle of concern around protests at migration hotels,
  leaning into the populist right. We’ve seen Reform politicians very strongly
  legitimise these concerns. “There’s a lot of concern about the emboldenment of
  the far right, and also the limited voices within the political mainstream
  calling for a different narrative around issues of migration. It would be good
  to see a little more moral leadership rather than pandering.” Jackson
  identifies a number of factors behind the current situation, including the
  ascent of Donald Trump in the US. One fundamental factor, he says, is a
  collapse in trust in government responses to asylum and migration. “We’ve seen
  over the last generation a breakdown in trust in government policymaking
  around migration, and I think that’s partly thanks to mainstream politicians’
  failure to speak truthfully on this issue.” Sunder Katwala, the director of
  the thinktank British Future, which researches public attitudes on immigration
  and national identity, points to the lack of government voices pushing back
  against the protests. “The Labour government is very quiet about racism this
  year compared to last, because it doesn’t want to accidentally sound as if
  it’s criticising people with legitimate concerns and so on,” he says. “The
  mainstream right and the mainstream centre-left have stopped doing the
  boundary-calling, and I think Reform, the Conservatives and sometimes the
  government are now crossing the line, because they’re unwilling to criticise
  anybody, whatever they’re saying.” Katwala stresses there has been no repeat
  of last year’s violence at protests, which for the most part have been
  numerically small, and points to polling showing that a similar proportion of
  people have “a lot” of sympathy for people crossing the Channel as have not
  much or no sympathy at all. Other polls show similar proportions of people
  think the UK should accept fewer refugees as think it should take more,
  (though the percentage who are welcoming has fallen since 2023, according to
  YouGov). Politics may be tilting right and the voices of those opposed to
  migration may be louder, but Katwala says: “The long-term trends in British
  society on tolerance of people across ethnic and faith lines are powerfully
  and strongly in a pro-tolerance, pro-liberal direction” – and markedly
  stronger in the UK than elsewhere in Europe or the US. No voice has been more
  striking on this than the family of Bebe King, one of the girls murdered in
  Southport, who hit out at the “despicable” actions of the far right who had
  “tried to make political gain from our tragedy”. Speaking to the Guardian
  earlier this month, Bebe’s grandfather Michael Weston King urged ministers to
  reconsider plans to change the law to give the ethnicity of suspects,
  describing it as “apparent kowtowing to the likes of Farage and Reform,
  [which] is extremely disappointing, though perhaps not surprising”. A
  significant silent majority is tolerant and welcoming of refugees, says
  Katwala, but ongoing dysfunction in the asylum system does not help. “Chaos
  isn’t good for advocates of refugee protection. So the left of this debate has
  definitely got an interest in the government showing it can control asylum
  while taking refugees,” he says. “I think the government really does have to
  get a grip on the visible lack of control in the Channel itself and in hotels
  in the towns where people live. If we don’t do that, there are political risks
  to them, but also there are risks to the principle of refugee protection.” •
  This article was amended on 24 August 2025. The man charged over the alleged
  sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl is Ethiopian, not Syrian as an earlier
  version said.
