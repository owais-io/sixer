  The financing of transition mineral mining is driving widespread environmental
  destruction and human rights abuses, according to a report. Banks and
  investors have ploughed hundreds of billions of dollars into companies mining
  for minerals for the manufacture of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries,
  energy grids and electric vehicles in the past decade, according to the
  research. But the institutions funding this extraction have “dangerously weak”
  environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies relating to mineral
  mining, the report says, with most lacking any meaningful safeguards for
  communities and ecosystems. “Without urgent reform, finance will continue to
  reinforce an extractive, high-risk model that undermines both climate and
  nature goals, and tramples human rights,” according to the report. Maurício
  Angelo, the executive director of Mining Observatory, said: “Mining is one of
  the main causes of the climate crisis and now presents itself as a central
  part of the solution to the problem in the energy transition without changing
  its exploration model and value chain worldwide. This is a glaring
  contradiction that can no longer be ignored by decision-makers.” The research
  has been undertaken by the Forests &amp; Finance coalition, an initiative that
  researches who is funding the companies involved in a range of industries
  affecting tropical forests and the communities that rely on them in south-east
  Asia, central and west Africa, and parts of South America. According to the
  report, leading banks poured $493bn (£369bn) in loans and underwriting into
  transition mineral mining companies between 2016 and 2024, while investors
  held $289bn (£216bn) in bonds and shares. But the ESG policies held across 30
  top institutions devoting the most in financing to projects were weak, leading
  to a situation where nearly 70% of transition mineral mines overlap with
  Indigenous or peasant lands, and 71% were located in high-biodiversity regions
  already under climate and social stress. Drawing on case studies from
  Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the report
  links transition mineral mining to deforestation, pollution, Indigenous rights
  violations, unsafe labour practices, new coal plants, fatal and catastrophic
  collapses of tailings dams, and ecosystem destruction. With four-fifths of the
  investments into miners coming from institutions in the US, Australia, the UK,
  Japan and Brazil, the report calls on governments to “embed justice and
  environmental protection into financial regulation”, enforce corporate
  transparency and accountability, and to strengthen mandatory due diligence on
  issues of environment and human rights. It also calls on financial
  institutions to reform their approach to financing miners, specifically that
  they should embed respect for human rights and international law into their
  policies, and exclude companies linked to deforestation and rights abuses.
  “This should be a wake-up call for every policymaker, banker and investor: you
  cannot build a just energy future by trampling rights, displacing communities
  and torching biodiversity,” said Stephanie Dowlen, a forest campaigner with
  Rainforest Action Network, a member of the Forests &amp; Finance coalition. “A
  just transition needs finance that no longer rewards bad behaviour and
  corporate impunity.
