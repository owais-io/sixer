  John Oliver took a hard look at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on
  the latest Last Week Tonight, as more and more videos of Ice raids across US
  cities continue to show a brutal crackdown on undocumented people. “For all
  the administration’s talk of targeting dangerous criminals, the reality is
  very different,” Oliver started. The Trump administration has set a goal of
  deporting one million people a year, “which, it’s worth noting, would be more
  than double the previous record of 400,000 when Obama was president, which was
  already very high”, said Oliver. “But notably, they don’t seem to be getting
  near their target numbers.” As of taping, the administration had deported
  about 280,000 people, “so getting to a million in just six months seems very
  unlikely”. “And they have backed themselves into this corner, because
  ‘promising’ to deport a million criminal migrants is one thing, but once
  you’re in charge, you then have to find that many of them,” he continued,
  “which is going to be hard if they don’t exist in the numbers that you’re
  claiming, which they don’t. “It’s like promising to apprehend 10,000 Fred
  Dursts a day,” he added. “There just aren’t that many out there, so either you
  have to admit that your target number was bullshit in the first place or you
  have to drastically widen your definition of what a Fred Durst is until you’re
  eventually arresting any gen X-er wearing a hat. “But instead of conceding
  their numbers were inflated, the administration is trying to drive up arrests
  at all costs.” The Trump aide Stephen Miller has instructed Ice agents to
  target Home Depots and 7-Elevens, and the agency has rapidly deputized a
  record number of local police to function as deportation agents. They have
  brought in border patrol as well as the national guard; at least a quarter of
  the Drug Enforcement Administration’s workforce; 80% of the Bureau of Alcohol,
  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and even members of the US Postal Service.
  “This mass reallocation of resources means that other crimes are going less
  policed,” Oliver explained. The FBI, for example, has instructed agents to
  prioritize immigration enforcement at the expense of white-collar crime and
  investigations into sexual abuse. “I gotta say: for a guy who pandered so
  heavily to people convinced pedophiles, sex offenders and traffickers had
  infiltrated our government, Trump’s sure making the government a lot
  friendlier to them,” said Oliver. “Ghislaine Maxwell’s in a nicer cell now,
  Lawrence Taylor’s advising on kids’ physical fitness. Fuck it, at this point,
  if he’s willing to wear a Maga hat, I really don’t see why Roman Polanski
  can’t come back.” Nevertheless, “border czar” Tom Homan claimed that 70% of
  those arrested by Ice were criminals, while the other 30% were national
  security threats who “don’t have a criminal history because they try to lay
  low until it’s time for them to do things bad”. “Under his logic, I guess
  anyone could be a national security threat,” said Oliver. But “Homan’s numbers
  are also nowhere near Ice’s own data,” which found that only 40% of those
  arrested had any criminal history, including traffic infractions, and just 7%
  were convicted of any sort of violent crime. In fact, as of June, people with
  only civil or immigration violations – no criminal convictions – made up the
  largest percentage of arrests nationwide. “Maybe the clearest sign that this
  is more about pushing up numbers than catching violent criminals on the run is
  that one of the key places where they’re now fishing for arrests is
  immigration court, where people show up for their hearings,” he added. As
  numerous videos showed, Ice agents arrested people who showed up to process
  their situation legally, using a loophole that allows the government to deport
  people without due process if their immigration case is dismissed. “It is the
  laziest possible way to juice up your numbers,” said Oliver, “because you’re
  targeting people who are going through the system ‘in the right way’ and
  turning them into people you can immediately arrest and deport.” This trap was
  among “things the administration is doing that sure feel like they’re breaking
  the law” but “often aren’t”. Oliver took the “dystopian visual” of Ice agents
  wearing masks, which is actually legal, as no federal law prevents it. “So
  they can do it, but why are they?” The administration claims that it’s for
  their own protection, with the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem,
  including videotaping arrests as an act of “violence” against agents. All of
  this “gets even more worrying” when one remembers that Trump’s One Big
  Beautiful Bill Act contains a huge surge of funding for immigration
  enforcement – roughly $170bn over the next few years, some of which is set
  aside for the hiring of 10,000 new Ice agents. “For what it’s worth, massive
  rapid hiring sprees never tend to work out well,” Oliver noted. Past efforts
  to bolster Customs and Border Protection under George Bush ended up with
  hiring drug cartel members and an actual serial killer. “And it’s not a great
  sign for who Ice is appealing to that they’re currently posting gross
  recruitment ads, like this fake minivan ad tagged: ‘Think about how many
  criminal illegal aliens you could fit in this bad boy!’” he added. “And they
  seem more than a little desperate already, as they’ve already removed age
  limits for hiring agents.” And this past week, Ice shared a video of their
  newest recruit: former Superman actor Dean Cain. “You know, there’s an old
  saying in Hollywood: ‘If all you can get is Dean Cain, you are fucked,’”
  Oliver joked. “Now, I’m not saying that Ice isn’t finding people,” he
  continued. “I’m just saying, when you are reduced to pinning a badge on the
  59-year-old star of The Dog Who Saved Christmas, The Dog Who Saved Christmas
  Vacation, The Dog Who Saved the Holidays, The Dog Who Saved Halloween, The Dog
  Who Saved Easter and The Dog Who Saved Summer, maybe you are in trouble.
  Although, on the plus side, no need for that guy to wear a mask because the
  chances of anyone recognizing him are fucking zero.” So what can be done? “As
  powerless as this can feel, as individuals there are still actions you can
  take,” said Oliver, such as recording any arrest you witness involving Ice
  agents. Oliver also advised that if you’re approached by Ice agents, whether
  or not you’re a citizen, “attorneys told us the only two things you should say
  to them are: ‘Am I free to leave?’ And: ‘I want to speak to a lawyer.’ That’s
  it. You have the right to remain silent. And I recognize that in some cases
  you may be unable to help yourself from saying: ‘Didn’t you used to be
  Superman?’ ‘I thought you died.’ ‘I can’t believe I’m meeting a film-maker.’
  But that really is it.” “We are still in a very grim moment,” he added. “The
  rightwing narrative is that most people are rabid to punish anyone who wants
  to become new Americans. But that is just not true,” as new polls found 80%
  support a pathway to legal citizenship for undocumented immigrants. “Nor are
  their bullshit claims about who’s being targeted and arrested. “And I’m not
  saying that everything Ice is doing right now is illegal,” he concluded. “What
  I’m saying is, a whole bunch of it feels like it really should be. And we need
  to change that at our earliest opportunity.”
