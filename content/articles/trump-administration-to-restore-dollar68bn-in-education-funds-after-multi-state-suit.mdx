  After a multi-state lawsuit over Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to freeze more
  than $6.8bn in education funding to US schools, the Trump administration has
  agreed to restore the funds for a range of educational services, including
  after school and summer learning, teacher training, and support for
  English-learners. The administration did not give a clear explanation as to
  why it had withheld the congressionally-allocated funds, though a spokesperson
  for the White House Office of Management and Budget had indicated that review
  found instances of federal education money being “grossly misused to subsidize
  a radical left-wing agenda”. Following a lawsuit brought by the attorneys
  general of California and 22 other states, as well as the governors of two
  states, the administration released some funding. On Monday, California
  attorney general Rob Bonta announced that the states secured an agreement to
  have the funding fully restored. “The Trump administration upended school
  programs across the country when it recklessly withheld vital education
  funding just weeks before the school year was set to begin,” Bonta said.
  “Fortunately, after we filed our lawsuit, the Trump Administration backed down
  and released the funding it had previously withheld … Our kids deserve so much
  better than what this anti-education administration has to offer, and we will
  continue to fight to protect them from this president’s relentless attacks.”
  In their lawsuit, states accused the administration of holding back money
  illegally, as the US constitution gives congress the rights to appropriate
  funding, and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 bars the president from
  unilaterally withholding funds designated by congress. The delayed funds,
  which were frozen just weeks before the start of the school year this year,
  had left many communities and school districts uncertain if they would be able
  to sustain programs. The withheld funds affected after-school and other
  programs attended by about 1.4 million children nationwide, according to the
  nonprofit group Afterschool Alliance. Most of the programs benefit low-income
  families. The funds also covered programs to retain teachers, especially in
  low-income school districts. Since taking office, Donald Trump has pushed to
  reshape public education in the US to fit more closely with his rightwing
  political and social beliefs. He had repeatedly threatened to withhold federal
  funds from states over policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in
  sports. It has also separately threatened or cancelled for sex ed over
  mentions of transgender people from educational materials. The administration
  has also pushed states to disqualify immigrant students from discounted
  in-state tuition reserved for state residents.
