  Queensland’s supreme court has temporarily ordered a council not to evict
  homeless residents from sleeping in a park, warning those sleeping rough faced
  “serious risk of harm” if denied shelter. Justice Paul Smith issued the
  injunction on Friday as part of an ongoing human rights challenge by 11
  residents of Goodfellows Road, a park in Kallangur. It prevents the City of
  Moreton Bay from evicting anyone from the park while an application
  challenging the council’s homelessness policies continues. “If shelter was to
  be taken away, the applicants would be placed at serious risk of harm from
  being exposed to the elements,” Smith said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  The council changed its local laws to ban homelessness in February. In April,
  it started evicting residents of several homeless shelters with the aid of
  police, council rangers, a bulldozer and an excavator. Law firms Hall &amp;
  Wilcox and Basic Rights Queensland challenged the practice under Queensland’s
  Human Rights Act. Many of the residents of Goodfellows Road previously resided
  in Eddie Hyland Park in Lawnton, before they were moved on from there in
  April. They were then issued notices ordering them to move on from the new
  park in June. Smith said he was persuaded that there was a prima facie case
  suggesting the council had failed to make proper consideration of potential
  breaches of the Human Rights Act before enacting its new local laws. Under
  Queensland law, human rights may be limited by government action but only
  after consideration and where doing so is proportionate. “I find there is a
  reasonable argument on the part of the applicants that the relevant decisions
  infringe these particular rights and insufficient considerations given to
  those rights before the decisions were made,” he said. Smith found the council
  would be harmed less by his granting the injunction than those sleeping rough
  would be if he did not grant it. “I can understand that some of the community
  might complain about homeless people living in their midst in tents,” he said.
  “On the other hand, the Human Rights Act provides protections to all citizens,
  including the homeless, and I consider it to be wrong not to protect
  vulnerable applicants from the potential loss of their homes in the midst of
  winter. “There is a risk in my mind that the applicants may lose their homes”.
  The Moreton Bay council acting chief executive officer, Matt Anderson, said in
  a statement released after the court hearing that the injunction meant rough
  sleepers would be able to remain at Goodfellow’s Road “for now”. He said the
  council “will comply with the decision of the court”. Anderson described the
  legal challenge as “disappointing”. “As a community, we should all be working
  towards ending homelessness. Bringing this matter to court does nothing to
  resolve this issue,” he said. The council’s lawyer, Scott McCleod, argued that
  the City of Moreton Bay had promised in correspondence to the court not to
  enforce the notices. However, Smith said it had not made a formal undertaking
  to allow the applicants to stay. Barrister Matthew Hickey, acting for the
  applicants, argued they were vulnerable people who had nowhere else to go if
  evicted again. Under the order, the council is still permitted to enforce
  local laws intended to ensure public health and safety that existed before it
  banned homelessness. The injunction will apply until the case is heard in full
  in November. The court heard the government may request a later date.
