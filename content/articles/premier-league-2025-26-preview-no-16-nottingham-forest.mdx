  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 12th (NB: this is not necessarily Will
  Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 7th Prospects There is a sense they will need to be better in
  possession and dominate games because playing twice a week, once European
  competition begins, is especially difficult for a team who are chasing the
  ball and playing on the counter. The system has worked well for Nuno Espírito
  Santo in the past, but tevolution may be required to keep Forest ahead of the
  game. Pre-season has brought an early shift in style and the change has been
  enthusiastically welcomed within the club. One problem has been evident: they
  are struggling to score. Forest played seven friendlies, scoring once and
  enduring five goalless draws. It was not ideal preparation for building on an
  incredibly successful year, but everyone will forget as long as early points
  are picked up. A lack of chances being created has not been the issue, more
  composure in front of goal, which could lead to another striker being
  welcomed. The loss of Anthony Elanga is a problem much time over recent weeks
  has been spent trying to solve. His electric pace was instrumental in Nuno’s
  plans and finding a direct replacement is difficult when the predecessor
  probably could challenge for an Olympic sprinting medal, but there are high
  expectations of Dan Ndoye after his club-record signing. Considering everyone
  expected Morgan Gibbs-White to join Tottenham for £60m, the fact he has stayed
  and signed a new three-year contract is incredible news for the club.
  Evangelos Marinakis has received plenty of criticism since Forest’s promotion,
  but deserves credit for single-handedly taking on the role of convincing
  Gibbs-White to commit at the City Ground. Forest fell short in the hunt for
  the Champions League as tiredness crept into a shallow squad late on and are
  waiting for more depth to be added. A full-back, midfielder, winger and
  striker remain on the shopping list. The manager Nuno can do no wrong after
  leading Forest into Europe for the first time in 30 years. There is plenty of
  quiet charm to the former goalkeeper, who keeps things simple around the
  training ground and is respected by everyone who comes into contact with him.
  He may want to push on from finishing an incredible seventh, but maintaining
  the stability he has brought is the most important thing. Balancing domestic
  and continental competitions will be imperative because it is a fine balance
  for a mid-table side. Off-field picture The former Arsenal sporting director
  Edu has joined the wider group as global head of football. It may explain why
  the Brazilian/Botafogo market has been further explored, as does the close
  relationship between Marinakis and John Textor, but the wider effect is yet to
  be seen. The Gibbs-White saga with Forest complaining about an alleged illegal
  approach by Tottenham, and the wait to find out whether the club would be in
  the Europa League or Conference League, ensured things were not calm. Forest
  were granted planning permission to expand the City Ground to 35,000 by
  constructing a new 10,000-seat stand. Star signing Ndoye is their record
  signing and the decision to spend €40m on the Swiss winger was not made
  lightly. A replacement for Elanga was needed and Ndoye was quickly targeted
  after shining with Bologna, helping them reach the Champions League and
  gaining some European experience. At 24, there is room for improvement, which
  fits the club’s transfer strategy. He is not as quick as Elanga, but his stats
  are impressive, including scoring eight goals and creating another four in 30
  Serie A appearances last season. An eagerness to test himself in the Premier
  League was key to the move. Stepping up Zach Abbott signed a new four-year
  deal during the summer and is extremely highly thought of at the City Ground.
  He was given a surprise first start at right-back in the FA Cup semi-final
  against Manchester City, having started in his more regular centre-back role
  against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, and will be eager to build on the
  experience. The 19-year-old has been part of the first-team squad for the past
  couple of seasons but has made three appearances and is yet to appear in the
  Premier League. Considering the increase in matches caused by European
  qualification, it feels inevitable he will get more opportunities. A big
  season for … Taiwo Awoniyi helped keep Forest in the top flight with crucial
  goals in his first season. Fitness and form have since caused the Nigerian
  problems, and it has not helped him that Chris Wood has become one of the
  finest strikers in the Premier League, limiting Awoniyi’s chances. It combined
  to leave him with two goals from 32 games last season. Awoniyi looked sharp in
  pre-season, giving the impression his physicality, speed and finishing could
  again be an asset to Nuno, but will need an early goal to ignite his
  confidence.
