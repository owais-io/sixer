  As Donald Trump convened reporters at the White House on Monday morning to
  announce his plans for sending the national guard on to Washington DC streets
  and taking over the police department, protesters gathered a block away to
  denounce what they saw as his plans to put the federal district under his
  thumb. “Nothing Trump is doing right now is about our safety,” Keya
  Chatterjee, executive director of Free DC, a group advocating for the city’s
  autonomy, told the 200 or so people gathered on a block of 16th Street
  Northwest that had once been called Black Lives Matter Plaza, before the city
  government ordered the name stripped shortly after Trump’s inauguration this
  year. “What we know from history is that authoritarians always want to control
  the capital and the people in the capital city. It’s because it’s the fastest
  way to silence dissent and to accelerate their agenda. And I want to be clear,
  this is not about crime. This is about what Trump is trying to do to DC in
  order to take over DC and silence us.” Lamont Mitchell was not so sure. A
  lifelong Washingtonian who resides among the poorer and more crime-stricken
  neighborhoods east of the Anacostia river, he regarded Trump’s plans for the
  homeless as “inhumane”, but was open to his ideas for making the city’s
  streets safer. Mitchell described how he avoids certain areas on his drive
  home for fear of being struck by a stray bullet, no longer walks down certain
  blocks, had his RV stolen and plans to buy a gun. “As a senior in Washington,
  I need to feel safe,” said 69-year-old Mitchell, who chairs the Anacostia
  Coordinating Council community organization. “We gotta take drastic action
  when drastic action is called for.” The overwhelmingly Democratic federal
  district is the latest American city to which Trump has deployed troops since
  taking office, after sending active-duty marines and national guard into Los
  Angeles in June to quell protests over immigration enforcement. This time, the
  foe is crime that the president argues is “out of control”, and the catalyst
  is the attack of a staffer from the “department of government efficiency” in a
  relatively safe neighborhood earlier this month. Mayor Muriel Bowser has
  called Trump’s intervention “unsettling and unprecedented”, as well as
  unwarranted. City leaders have pointed to statistics that show crimes such as
  robbery, homicide and assault with a deadly weapon are down, and violent crime
  hit a 30-year low in 2024. Yet Washington continues to struggle with rates of
  violent crime that are higher than cities with similar populations, according
  to the Real-Time Crime Index from AH Datalytics. Residents are used to hearing
  reports of violence, though much of it occurs in the city’s poorer, majority
  Black eastern third, far from the museums and monuments of the National Mall.
  They are also used to seeing a lot of police – about 50 law enforcement
  agencies are already in Washington DC, ranging from the citywide Metropolitan
  police department (MPD) to the obscure zoo police, FBI police and Federal
  Reserve police, which provide security around specific agencies. National
  guard troops and agents from the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (Ice) are now expected to be on the streets along those officers, but
  residents are unsure whether they will make much difference. “I tend to be
  pretty cynical about what the Trump administration is doing right now. This
  seems pretty clearly just like red meat to throw to his base, this
  announcement on a Monday,” said Brian Strege, a neighborhood commissioner in
  Navy Yard, where groups of young people have appeared repeatedly over the
  summer, shooting off fireworks and harassing bystanders. “I get the sense it’s
  just going to be a lot of bored national guard troops wandering around the
  city.” Trump made mention of the disturbances in Navy Yard during his White
  House press conference, but Strege said the city had already taken steps to
  stop the disorder, including by instituting a night-time curfew this summer
  for people under 18. Trump plans to take over the police department for 30
  days – right around the time schools resume, and Strege said the teenagers
  typically stop showing up. “Thirty days from now is going to be September. Our
  juvenile crime is likely to decrease, because it always does. So, it sounds
  like they’re going to pretend that it went down because they did this big
  deployment,” he said. “I don’t see it helping really at all. I think our
  police force has actually been doing a pretty good job over the past few
  years.” Last Saturday night saw more teenagers flood Navy Yard, as well as a
  shooting. The following day, Edward Daniels, another neighborhood commissioner
  in the area, saw Ice agents patrolling the street, and at one point stopping
  some teenagers from riding bikes, which others had used in the past to harass
  people. Their presence, he said, didn’t make him feel safe, but rather
  concerned – did these agents know how to patrol a city? Were they coordinating
  with the police department? “It’s going to make things even more chaotic here
  and cause what I believe to be even more dangerous situations than what we’ve
  seen here on the ground,” he said. Across the Anacostia river, Sandra Seegars,
  a longtime anti-crime activist, welcomed Trump’s announcement. Her Congress
  Heights neighborhood has one of the highest homicide rates in the city,
  according to police data, and she was pleased to hear from a friend that
  federal agents had been spotted in a nearby park. “He’s going to make me feel
  safer,” Seegars said of Trump’s deployment. “I think he’s doing the right
  thing. He should have done it before now.”
