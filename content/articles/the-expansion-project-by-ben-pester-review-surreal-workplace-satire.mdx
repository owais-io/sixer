  “I knew she wouldn’t leave the floor, but still I felt the slow panic coming
  on. A supermarket form of dread – you expect to find the lost child in the
  next aisle, but the next aisle is empty, so you push on to the next … [until]
  there are not enough aisles left to give you hope.” Tom Crowley’s
  eight-year-old daughter Hen (not her real name, but also not short for
  Henrietta) has gone missing, somewhere in the Piranesi-esque corridors of
  Tom’s workplace, Capmeadow Business Park. It’s bring your daughter to work
  day, and it’s not the first time that morning that he’s lost her. But this
  feels different – to Tom, and to the reader, who might briefly suspect that
  they are in a contemporary update of Ian McEwan’s The Child in Time. Tom soon
  finds Hen, then loses her again – “properly gone this time” – or doesn’t. She
  is nowhere to be found on Capmeadow’s entry records or CCTV, because she may
  never have been there in the first place. Tom is convinced that he had an
  email about bring your daughter to work day, but he can’t find it, and no one
  else seems to have heard of it. When confronted with the evidence, he
  eventually signs a corporate-Stalinist affidavit “officially agreeing” that he
  never brought Hen to Capmeadow. But he continues to believe that he did, and
  becomes a kind of living ghost stalking the business park. Ben Pester’s first
  novel, following his 2021 story collection Am I in the Right Place?, is
  formally a collage, put together decades or centuries in the future by an
  unnamed “Archivist” who is meant to be studying the business park’s “Expansion
  Project” but keeps getting drawn into individual lives such as Tom’s, and thus
  becomes an accidental practitioner of “history from below”. It shares the
  collection’s office setting and surrealist approach: Am I in the Right Place?
  could just as easily have been the title of the novel. Workplace novels are
  everywhere. It is to fiction, rather than journalism, that we can turn for
  fine-grained accounts of life in big-box stores (Adelle Waldman’s Help
  Wanted), technical writers’ collectives (Joseph O’Neill’s Godwin) or
  tidal-energy startups (Alexander Starritt’s Drayton and Mackenzie). The world
  of work seems to have supplanted marriage and the family as the place where
  novelists examine questions of identity and relationships. The Expansion
  Project is an office novel of a very different kind, as abstract as, say, Help
  Wanted is concrete. If it can seem as though Pester has no interest in what
  Tom actually does (he works in the “engineering division”, and Cath Corbett,
  who may or may not be his boss, describes him as a “content specialist”), or
  in what the Expansion Project entails (we learn little about Capmeadow and
  nothing at all about the firms presumably based there), then that is the
  point. There are costs to this level of abstraction. A novel about every
  workplace risks being one about no actual workplace. Capmeadow, with its line
  managers and endless emails and “mindfulness apps” and dehumanising HR,
  presiding over a “managerial class” who wear expensive suits and drink £10
  bottles of still water, runs dangerously close to cliche – cliches that
  rehearse the prejudices of the novel’s putative readership. Pester’s rendering
  of corporate-bureaucratic language (“forbidden” becomes “non-accepted”, and so
  on) also feels rather commonplace. The destabilising power of The Expansion
  Project is not satirical – at least not in the comic sense. That power lies,
  firstly, in Pester’s protagonist. Ultimately defeated, Tom Crowley thinks that
  his family see him as a “painless wound”, to be tolerated but not thought
  about. The reader knows better. From his struggles to convert the overpowering
  love he feels for his children into competent parenting, to his attempts to
  survive and contribute at Capmeadow, Tom is all pain – giver and recipient.
  But, as we learn over the course of the novel, he is the canary in the data
  mine. The total collapse of Tom’s sense of stable, known reality – of the
  boundaries between physical and digital, memory and dream, work and life –
  lies in wait for the other characters, and for us. The landscape of Capmeadow
  – “cloud-forestry” visible through the windows, a sculpture-filled Resilience
  Garden – is only a logical extension of an AI-generated Zoom background. The
  Expansion Project is less an indictment of late capitalism than a horror story
  about screen society, in which sensations are constant and images refuse to
  separate into the real and imagined. • The Expansion Project by Ben Pester is
  published by Granta (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy at
