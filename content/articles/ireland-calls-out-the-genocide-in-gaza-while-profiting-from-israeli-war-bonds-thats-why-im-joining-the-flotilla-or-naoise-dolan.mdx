  Hundreds of people from 44 countries are sailing to Gaza in the Global Sumud
  Flotilla this week. I am among them. We aim to non-violently break Israel’s
  illegal siege by delivering much-needed supplies. I joined the mission
  because, as an Irish person, I have watched my government meet what our
  taoiseach acknowledges to be a genocide with little more than the occasional
  round of three Hail Marys. In fact, that framing is overly generous. The Irish
  government is not just passively useless in the face of genocide; it aids and
  abets the perpetrators. US military planes potentially carrying arms to Israel
  routinely pass through Ireland’s Shannon airport without inspection. A 2018
  Occupied Territories bill originally intended to ban all trade with illegal
  Israeli settlements is now in its seventh year of legislative limbo, with
  endless dithering as to whether it should include services. By Israel’s
  choice, Ireland’s central bank is, since Brexit, the sole regulating authority
  in the EU that approves for trading Israel’s explicitly marketed war bonds for
  sale across the bloc. Selling bonds allows Israel to raise cash
  internationally that it is openly using to fund its campaign in Gaza. In June,
  the Irish government defeated a motion to end the central bank’s facilitation
  of the sale of these bonds. There is a dystopian irony in actively choosing to
  remain Israel’s “home” country for bonds approval – in the financial
  terminology – while claiming to condemn its forced dispossessions. Ireland’s
  solidarity with Palestine is easily romanticised by those abroad and by the
  Irish ourselves. We take a strange exceptionalist pride in having recognised
  Palestinian statehood in May 2024, nearly four decades after the first wave of
  89 countries did in 1988-89. We were the 142nd country to do so. But the
  Palestinian activists we claim to stand with are intensely aware of our
  government’s hypocrisy. At any big protest in Ireland, you’ll hear speakers
  who’ve recently fled Gaza condemning their complicity. Nor does the state’s
  purely rhetorical support fool those in Northern Ireland; pro-Palestine
  campaigners there are as critical of Dublin as of the UK government. From many
  Belfasters’ perspectives, it makes perfect sense that the 26-county republic
  would collaborate with colonial occupation while paying lip service to hoping
  it will end. Within the EU, Ireland faces little scrutiny for its complicity
  in Israel’s war crimes compared with the amount understandably directed at
  Germany. I was living in Berlin when Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in
  retaliation for the crimes of Hamas on 7 October, which themselves occurred
  after decades of illegal Israeli occupation and a siege on Gaza dating from
  2007. I was detained twice by German police simply for being at pro-Palestine
  demonstrations but I witnessed far worse repression against other protesters,
  with Muslims especially targeted for violence. German policing of Palestine
  protests has become even heavier since I returned to Ireland in January. Last
  week, a 25-year-old Dubliner, Kitty O’Brien, was twice violently assaulted by
  police at a Gaza demonstration in Berlin. This violence led to spontaneous
  protests in Ireland, and expressions of deep concern from the taoiseach and
  Ireland’s ambassador to Germany. I have found Ireland a less hostile
  environment to protest in. But the necessity to protest at all comes from my
  government’s failure to respond on a policy level. There is the illusion of a
  debate among European countries: we’ve got Germany backing Israel, and
  countries such as Ireland and Spain (along with Norway) backing Palestine, so
  let’s see how they resolve it in the grand old marketplace of ideas. This
  fiction flatters all involved. The countries relatively critical of Israel
  evade scrutiny for still not having domestically sanctioned it; they’re
  pushing for this to happen at an EU level, after all. And Germany benefits
  from a conversation held on the premise that all EU countries maintain
  economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Its critics’ authority in condemning
  the genocide is diluted by their failure to treat it in practice as one.
  Domestically, Irish campaigning on Palestine is now focused on a 2 September
  deadline to renew the central bank’s approval of Israeli bonds. The bank
  already renewed their approval last September, nearly a year into the
  genocide. The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) group holds weekly
  protests on the issue, usually outside the central bank. Another coalition of
  demonstrators has committed to “civil disobedience” every week for the
  foreseeable future, with its first actions consisting of stopping traffic in
  central Dublin. Trade unions have been increasingly involved at protests,
  including an Irish representative of the Marseille dock workers who have been
  blocking shipments of military aid to Israel. There is a growing sense in the
  movement that lobbying is insufficient and that industrial action is needed:
  the 11 Dunnes Stores retail workers who refused to handle South African
  produce in 1984 are a frequently cited example and one of them, Mary Manning,
  spoke at a national IPSC rally last month. If the bank renews the bonds on 2
  September, it could well serve as the catalyst. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund
  has just divested from five Israeli banks and from Caterpillar, the US
  construction equipment manufacturer that supplies Israel with bulldozers to
  destroy Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank. The fund held stakes
  in 38 Israeli companies as of 14 August, and has not promised to divest in all
  cases, only to review potential human rights violations. The Spanish
  government is aiming to pass a full arms embargo against Israel, with Pedro
  Sánchez, the prime minister, under pressure to recall the country’s ambassador
  in Tel Aviv. These moves are progressive compared with other EU governments,
  but lag years behind public opinion. In Ireland, we are all too familiar with
  our governments acting only once public pressure becomes unsustainable, then
  peacocking about their progressive credentials. I screamed in frustration when
  international media fawned over the supposed governmental achievements of our
  marriage equality and abortion rights referendums being passed in 2015 and
  2018 respectively. Both campaigns forced citizens to knock on doors begging
  our neighbours for our rights, to stay composed when they called us perverts
  and baby killers. Activists fought for decades before our supposed leaders
  brought either matter to a vote, and in the case of marriage equality they
  could have just legislated for it. Everyone will have always been against what
  was happening in Palestine once it’s safely in the past tense. While it is
  happening, EU governments stay complicit. Some leaders call it a genocide,
  some don’t. They all still trade with its perpetrators. My government can
  watch the mass murder in Gaza and continue with business as usual. I can’t;
  that’s why I’m sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla. The broader Global
  Movement to Gaza behind the flotilla is a massive civilian-led international
  movement for the Palestinian cause, based on the human need to keep trying. If
  we reach our destination, we will break a siege that our so-called leaders
  haven’t dared to even sanction. If we fail, at least our own response to a
  genocide will not have been to keep regulating the perpetrator’s war bonds.
