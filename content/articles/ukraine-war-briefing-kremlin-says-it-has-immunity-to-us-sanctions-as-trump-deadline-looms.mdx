  The Kremlin said on Wednesday it continued to monitor statements by US
  president Donald Trump regarding sanctions against Moscow, but that Russia had
  acquired immunity to such measures thanks to long experience. Trump said on
  Tuesday the US would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia in 10
  days if Moscow showed no progress towards ending its more than three-year-long
  war in Ukraine. “We have been living under a huge number of sanctions for
  quite a long time, our economy operates under a huge number of restrictions,”
  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Therefore, of course, we
  have already developed a certain immunity in this regard, and we continue to
  note all statements that come from President Trump, from other international
  representatives on this matter.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said
  on Wednesday that he had approved key principles for large-scale weapons
  agreements with the US. “These are large-scale agreements, which I discussed
  with President [Donald] Trump, and I hope very much that we will be able to
  implement them all,” Zelenskyy said in his evening video address to the
  nation, adding that it would strengthen both countries. He provided no
  specifics. Russian missile and drone strikes on Kyiv early on Thursday killed
  six people, including a six-year-old boy, the Ukrainian capital’s military
  administration said. More than 40 people were wounded, government officials
  said earlier, with damage caused to the children’s ward of a hospital as well
  as a school and kindergarten. The strikes targeted at least 10 locations
  around Kyiv, the military administration said on Telegram. Ukraine’s top
  diplomat called for “maximum pressure” on Russia after the attacks. Ukraine’s
  domestic security agency has detained an air force officer on charges of
  having spied for Russia by leaking the location of prized F-16 and Mirage 2000
  fighter jets, officials said on Wednesday. The unidentified officer, a flight
  instructor holding the rank of major, stands accused of helping Russia carry
  out airstrikes by providing coordinates and suggesting strike tactics, the
  Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said in a statement. More than 200 Kremlin
  critics including former political prisoners voiced outrage on Wednesday at
  the visit of a high-ranking Moscow delegation to Switzerland, accusing Europe
  of hosting “war criminals” despite the invasion of Ukraine. Opponents of
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin fear that, more than three years into Moscow’s
  invasion of Ukraine, some western powers and institutions are at risk of
  normalising relations with Moscow. The delegation, led by Valentina Matvienko,
  speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, arrived in Geneva on Sunday for
  the three-day gathering of global parliamentarians. Matvienko and two other
  Russian participants attending are under EU and international sanctions.
  “While Geneva hosts war criminals Matvienko, Tolstoi and Slutsky, Russian
  troops continue to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. Civilians,
  children and women are dying,” the signatories said. Trump said on Wednesday
  that he would impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional
  trade tax, beginning on Friday, because he says India’s purchasing of Russian
  oil is extending the war in Ukraine. He added that India had “always bought a
  vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s
  largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants
  Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE”. There has been a significant rise in
  child casualties in Ukraine in recent months as Russia indiscriminately
  targets heavily populated civilian areas, with 222 children killed or injured
  between March and May this year and 2,889 in total since the start of the
  invasion. Given the delay in verifying deaths, the UN says the true number is
  likely to be much higher. Moldova’s pro-European president Maia Sandu on
  Wednesday accused Russia of seeking to meddle in the September national
  elections, warning that Moscow was planning “unprecedented” action to “get its
  people into the next parliament”. Sandu, a vocal critic of Russia, in
  particular since the start of its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has repeatedly
  accused Moscow of political interference in the former Soviet republic that
  lies between Ukraine and the EU and Nato member Romania.
