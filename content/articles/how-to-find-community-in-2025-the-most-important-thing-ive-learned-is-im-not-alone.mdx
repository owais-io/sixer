  not alone’

  They say there’s no such thing as a free lunch. The idea? That everything has
  a cost, even if not financial. But I’m at my local Neighbourhood House, one of
  many community centres found across Australia, breaking bread with strangers
  and eating a genuinely free lunch. While it cost me time, what I’ve gained
  feels socially priceless: I’m getting to know my neighbours, something fewer
  and fewer Australians are doing. In 2000, Robert Putnam’s book Bowling Alone
  warned of declining civic participation and social connection in US society.
  Americans, he argued, were retreating from clubs, associations and volunteer
  groups – the building blocks of community connection – in favour of a more
  solitary existence. As Putnam put it at the time: “We used to bowl in leagues;
  now we bowl alone.” Although the prognosis was American, the symptoms were
  being felt in Australia too. Fast forward 25 years and they are even more
  pronounced. Australians are attending fewer community activities, volunteering
  less and have less trust in institutions and democracy. Political polarisation
  is on the up, while union and political party membership is down. The personal
  impacts are clear. Social isolation is now considered one of the greatest
  health risks to Australian society and nearly one in three people report being
  lonely. As Hugh Mackay, social psychologist and honorary professor at
  Australian National University, puts it: “We are born to connect, but lonelier
  than ever.” That’s not to say that Australians are not active members of their
  communities: the country enjoys some of the highest civic participation scores
  worldwide, helped by compulsory voting. But Australians invest in community
  with less frequency and vigour and, should the trend continue, it could have
  profound implications for our wellbeing, society and democracy. Our desire for
  connection has not disappeared. Peruse your preferred choice of media –
  newspaper, TikTok or TV panel show – and you’ll no doubt come across someone
  opining the loss of community. We have an unmet social hunger – or perhaps
  we’re looking in the wrong places. So, how does one reconnect with their
  community in 2025? My first stop is the social activity du jour in 2025: a
  running club. It’s relatively easy to sign up, though forcing myself out of
  bed at 7.30am on a Saturday is a harder sell. Once I arrive, I’m greeted with
  a warm round of applause as a newcomer. It’s disarming how friendly people
  are: there’s no pressure, no networking agenda, just a low-stakes friendliness
  that feels increasingly rare. Next, I enrol in a 10-week improvised comedy
  course. There’s a fee, so it’s not accessible to everyone, but it comes with
  its own kind of social benefit. Lesson one makes clear: being awkward is part
  of the process. I’m going to need to get used to that. So far, so good. For my
  next endeavour I turn to Dr Laurie Santos, professor of psychology at Yale
  University, for advice. Her class, Psychology and the Good Life, became the
  most popular course in Yale’s history when it launched in 2018. It focuses on
  something that statistics suggest eludes many of us: genuine happiness. Santos
  says having a strong social connection is correlated with lower levels of
  stress, reduced risk of chronic disease and longer life expectancy. To see the
  greatest benefits, one should pick activities that are intentional and involve
  supporting others. “Activities like volunteering at a local shelter, mentoring
  someone, or even organising community events can allow you to connect with
  others and give you a sense of purpose,” she says. “To make sure you’re
  getting the biggest happiness boost, try to find prosocial activities that
  allow you to see the positive effect of your actions on other people.” Judith
  Dickson is now retired but has been volunteering since she was 18. Over the
  years she has been involved in many different forms of community organising,
  including sports, social justice and gardening. “The most important thing I’ve
  learned is I’m not alone,” Dickson says. “It will help you feel useful and
  you’ll become connected to a wider community.” Beyond the personal impact, it
  has opened her up to other points of view. “I’ve met so many fabulous,
  interesting people and I’ve learned to see the world in different ways,” she
  says. “You forget what’s going on in your own life, you’re all working toward
  a shared goal.” As Dickson demonstrates, volunteering and other prosocial
  activities are important precisely because they are collective. Increasing
  individualism is one of the greatest risks to community, says Mackay, and
  reversing this is central to increasing social cohesion. “There’s increasing
  concern about ‘my rights, my entitlements’ – be that gender, ethnicity,
  religion, politics, culture,” Mackay says. These are important, he says, but
  far less important than what we have in common: our shared humanity. “In a
  fire or flood you don’t ask how someone voted in the [Indigenous] voice
  referendum – you just help.” In my own search for volunteering, I turn to the
  internet. What I find is disheartening: most volunteering opportunities
  involve lengthy forms, interviews and police background checks. When did
  trying to do good become so bureaucratic? I try short-circuiting the process
  by rocking up to my local op-shop and offering my time. I’m met with great
  enthusiasm – and quickly think to myself that this a great example of why
  in-person interaction is beneficial – only to be referred online to fill out
  another form. Mark Pearce, the chief executive of Volunteering Australia, says
  my experience is far from unique. He acknowledges the need for proper checks
  but says the growing administrative burden puts many people off. “We talk
  about volunteering as for the common good and without financial gain but it
  doesn’t always come free and oftentimes costs the volunteer,” he says. “Things
  like those regulatory burdens impact on people’s proclivity to volunteer
  through organisations.” Pearce says the increase in admin has – along with
  other factors – resulted in a rise of “informal volunteering”, where
  communities come together to tackle an issue without an institution or
  organisation. He says as many as 6 million Australians partake in this type of
  activity. But even to find that you have to know what you’re looking for and
  then seek out the right portal: a Facebook page, an Instagram profile or a
  MeetUp group. These spaces are often gatekept – you must request to join
  groups – and can be difficult to find. Googling “community events” does not,
  it turns out, bear fruit. It’s a paradox that the technologies which are
  blamed for eroding social ties are the ones we have to use to help rebuild
  them. Perhaps I’m falling into a trap: an expectation that, just like a
  takeaway order or parcel delivery arriving as and when I want it, community
  can be found online without friction or effort. Unlike many her age, Niamh
  Murray, 31, is an avid communitarian. She actively seeks out connection in
  various forms, which she calls “medicine”. “So often I’m sitting at home
  alone, feeling so isolated and like there’s so much disagreement in the
  world,” she says of her own doom-scrolling habits. “But when you come into
  community spaces you realise that there are so many more people who feel the
  same as you, who are lost and lonely, want more meaning in their life and want
  to make the world a better place.” The interactions she has through her
  community work are an antidote to the toxicity of the internet, she says.
  Despite Murray’s enthusiasm, my desire to attend running club and improv wanes
  as the burden of the search takes hold. But then around week four something
  starts to happen: I keep turning up consistently and the connections I’ve made
  blossom. I get offered lifts home, invited to other events and, through
  improv, I volunteer for Melbourne international comedy festival, opening up a
  whole new network of connections. I’m beginning to experience the benefits of
  what Putnam would term “reciprocity”. When you give without expectation of
  immediate return, it will come back to you later down the line. Reciprocity is
  the soil in which community connection grows. With this comes a sense of
  conviviality – I actively want to help others, to pay forward the social
  generosity shown to me. But so far my focus has been limited. My running club
  and improv are made up of people who look like me and, mostly, share my
  educational background. “The real secret for building social cohesion is not
  that we hang out with people like us, it’s that we’re prepared to hang out
  with people not like us,” Mackay reminds me. “We succeed when we invite the
  people next door in for a cup of tea, not for any reason other than because
  they’re neighbours.” Even with my newfound positivity, once I start noticing a
  dearth of community more generally, it feels confronting. Although having a
  friendly chat with someone while queueing for a coffee is nourishing – and
  studies show these “weak tie” kinds of interactions are just as important as
  friendships – I become frustrated with the fleeting nature of these moments. I
  find myself longing for what is probably a rose-tinted view of the past: a
  town square full of activity and socialising, where you could just turn up and
  be with others. In 2025 – at least in Melbourne – a friendly town square is
  hard to come by. So I try the next best thing: my local library. There I’m
  presented with a range of potential events I could join: reading groups,
  community gardening and walking societies. Just as with volunteering, choosing
  a community from a list feels somewhat sanitised, another example of the
  individualistic and consumerist creep into our everyday lives, rather than
  something that occurs organically. The tendency to treat community building as
  another thing to schedule into an already busy, optimised and curated
  existence feels at odds with what Mackay and Santos have told me. Community
  should feel natural and altruistic. Perhaps this is why informal volunteering
  is on the rise. But I reason that it takes work to get there, so I opt to try
  Neighbourhood House, which hosts free community events in centres around the
  country. I start attending their lunches and meet a range of people I can
  confidently say I would never have spoken to otherwise. At the same time, I
  come across an advertisement for a “language exchange” in my local newspaper
  (proof of local media’s value to community) and decide to go along. It’s in
  Melbourne’s city centre and the crowd is, from what I can tell, almost all new
  migrants. This is an important addition: the demographics of Australia have
  changed significantly in the past 25 years and, for the first time since
  colonisation, nearly a third of the population were not born here, up from 23%
  at the turn of the century. Although I’m a fairly new migrant myself, my
  experience as a white British man is different to many others, and most of my
  social circle were born in Australia. If I’m to create a truly representative
  community, I need to mix with people who weren’t. The Neighbourhood House
  lunch and the language exchange are somewhat more difficult than my previous
  attempts to connect: conversations are slower, common ground is harder to find
  and, on the whole, it feels less immediately satisfying. But buoyed up by the
  social boost from my other experiences, I push through. Slowly, my sense of
  community shifts. I feel less like an outsider and more like part of a whole.
  I am both energised and exhausted but I definitely feel better for it. It can
  be awkward, boring and, at times, testing: participation takes planning, but
  the joy comes from presence. Social friction isn’t avoidable if you want to be
  a good communitarian – it’s necessary. “Anyone can be nice to their friends,”
  Mackay says. “The challenge to social cohesion, to creating truly harmonious
  societies, is that we extend that to everyone. The state of the nation starts
  in your street.”
