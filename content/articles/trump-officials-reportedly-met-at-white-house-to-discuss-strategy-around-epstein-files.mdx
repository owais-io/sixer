  An advocacy group sued the US justice department and the FBI on Friday for
  records detailing their handling of the sex-trafficking investigation into the
  late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The legal organization Democracy Forward is
  seeking records related to senior administration officials’ communication
  about Epstein documents and any regarding correspondence between Epstein and
  Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington DC appears to
  be the first of its kind. The group says it submitted requests under the
  Freedom of Information Act (Foia) for the records related to communications
  about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled. “The court
  should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information
  they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the
  president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. The federal
  government often shields records related to criminal investigations from
  public view. The justice department did not immediately respond to a message
  seeking comment. Democracy Forward has filed dozens of lawsuits against
  Trump’s Republican administration, challenging a wide range of its policies
  and the president’s executive orders. The case has been subject to heightened
  public focus since the justice department said last month it would not release
  additional documents from the case. Meanwhile, top Trump officials reportedly
  met at the White House on Wednesday night to discuss strategy moving forward
  as the Trump administration continues to face criticism, including from
  Republicans, for its handling of the official files related to Epstein and the
  US president’s responses to calls for the release of all documents related to
  the criminal investigation. The meeting was reportedly hosted by JD Vance,
  with the gathering moved from the vice-president’s official residence to the
  White House, according to reporting by CNN. The meeting had been billed to
  include top Trump officials, including the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and
  the FBI director, Kash Patel. Vance and his staff had denied that a meeting to
  discuss the handling of the rumbling Epstein scandal was taking place. The
  Trump administration is now weighing whether to release recorded audio from
  the recent Department of Justice interview with Epstein’s convicted
  accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. The meeting’s main focus was expected to be the
  administration’s handling of the Epstein case and the need for a unified
  response, CNN reported, also saying that Trump officials were weighing whether
  the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, should hold a press conference
  about his two in-person interviews with Maxwell in Florida last month, before
  she was moved to a lower-security prison camp in Texas. Maxwell has recently
  opposed the release of grand jury testimony from her case, which prosecutors
  have sought after the justice department faced criticism after stating it had
  no further Epstein files even as the attorney general, Pam Bondi, had promoted
  the documents the department had. Maxwell is serving 20 years for
  sex-trafficking offenses after years as Epstein’s sidekick and has appealed to
  the US supreme court to overturn her case. She was convicted in New York after
  going to trial, while Epstein died in custody in New York while awaiting
  trial. The Department of Justice was given until noon on Friday to address
  privacy concerns from victims and Maxwell about the release of the testimony.
  The House oversight committee subpoenaed the Department of Justice on Tuesday
  for files in the case after Republicans in the House blocked efforts by
  Democrats to force the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files.
  Victims of Epstein and Maxwell have written letters to federal judges
  criticizing the Department of Justice’s approach to the case and it meetings
  with Maxwell. They largely have supported releasing the grand jury testimony
  as long as they were allowed to review the information and have sensitive
  information redacted. The Associated Press contributed reporting • This
  article was amended on 10 August 2025. An earlier version said that Todd
  Blanche’s two in-person interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell in Florida took
  place this month but actually they took place in July.
