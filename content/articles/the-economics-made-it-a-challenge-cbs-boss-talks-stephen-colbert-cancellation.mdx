  After much media consternation and criticism over the cancellation of The Late
  Show With Stephen Colbert, CBS chief has spoken up about the company’s
  decision to end the television institution after 32 years. Speaking at a press
  conference following the takeover of Paramount by the media conglomerate
  Skydance, George Cheeks, the chair of TV media at the company, attributed the
  cancellation to financial headwinds faced by the format. “The challenge in
  late night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular
  decline,” he said. “We are huge fans of Colbert, we love the show.
  Unfortunately the economics made it a challenge for us to keep going.” Cheeks
  added that as soon as Taylor Tomlinson, the 31-year-old former host of After
  Midnight, declined to return for another season in the slot formerly occupied
  by the Late Late Show with James Corden, he knew the network “couldn’t stay in
  that daypart”. “I know [Skydance] is going to invest, but they’re going to
  invest cautiously and wisely,” he said, indicating a focus on primetime and
  sports. Many had criticized the decision to cancel Colbert during a crucial
  window in the merger of Paramount and Skydance, which depended on approval
  from the Trump administration to proceed. The cancellation came just two days
  after Colbert publicly criticized his parent company’s settlement with Trump
  over a “frivolous” lawsuit regarding a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala
  Harris. During one of his monologues, Colbert referred to the $16m paid by
  Paramount to Trump a “big fat bribe” to approve the $8.4bn merger. Colbert’s
  announcement that his show would end next year was met with an outpouring of
  support from celebrities, as well as speculation that the decision was another
  effort by Paramount to appease Trump as well as the Skydance head, Larry
  Ellison, who has close ties with the president. But Cheeks said the decision
  was financial, following reports that the Late Show, which premiered in August
  1993 with David Letterman as host, was losing upwards of $40m a year. The
  late-night genre as a whole has faced significant financial challenges in
  recent years, with ad revenue plummeting 50% from just seven years ago. Cheeks
  declined to confirm how much the Late Show was losing, even as the ratings
  leader in the field for close to a decade, but said it was “significant” and
  in the “tens of millions of dollars”. “At the end of the day, it just wasn’t
  sustainable to continue,” he said. Cheeks, who came up in late night at NBC,
  also said that the timing for the decision came down to contract renewals for
  crew, including writers and producers. “We were at a period from a production
  standpoint where every year seasonally, this is [when] we negotiate new deals
  for writers and producers,” he said. “In addition, this is going to be the
  third season of Colbert’s three-year deal. So, in order to do those deals, we
  were going to have to change the terms from what we traditionally are,
  September to August, to September to May. “It was it incumbent upon me and us
  to make it clear to Stephen and his reps that this is where we were,” he
  added, noting that it was “too early to speculate” on what might replace the
  program in the 11.35pm ET time slot. Colbert will continue to host the show
  four nights a week until April 2026.
