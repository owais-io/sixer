  A murder investigation is under way after the fatal shooting of a 45-year-old
  man in north London. Police and paramedics were called to reports of gunshots
  fired just after midnight on Tuesday in the Stoke Newington area of Hackney.
  Officers arrived and found a man, with gunshot injuries. A Lime bike lay
  strewn on the pavement on one side of the road as paramedics attended to the
  victim on the other side. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The
  Metropolitan police said his next of kin had been informed and were being
  supported by specialist officers. Witnesses at the scene said they heard four
  or more gunshots followed by shouting and screaming. One man said he saw a
  person flee up Stoke Newington High Street after the shooting. No arrests have
  been made. The police cordoned off part of the high street. Buses were on
  diversion and the crime scene will remain in place as inquiries continue. Det
  Ch Supt Brittany Clarke, who leads policing for the area, said: “Our team of
  detectives and forensic specialists are working at pace to establish the full
  circumstances that led to the tragic death of this man. “We understand this
  incident will cause concern within the Stoke Newington community, however we
  do believe this to be an isolated incident at this stage of the investigation
  with no wider risk to the general public. “Residents can expect to see an
  increased police presence in the area, along with a crime scene, as we carry
  out our enquiries. We thank them for their patience and cooperation at this
  time. “We urge anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any information
  that could assist us, to come forward as soon as possible.” Anyone with
  information is urged to contact the police on 101, referencing CAD 108/5AUG.
  Information can be shared anonymously with Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111. The
  killing comes less than two months after the fatal stabbing of Annabel Rook in
  Stoke Newington.
