  Arne Slot has said Florian Wirtz must reach the standards set by Mohamed Salah
  to realise Liverpool’s expectations of their new record signing. Wirtz will
  make his Premier League debut when the champions open the season at home to
  Bournemouth on Friday. Slot said the Germany international’s “adjustment went
  better than expected, and we already expected a lot”, but admitted a more
  accurate gauge would take time. Liverpool consider the 22-year-old a
  transformative signing in the mould of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson. Their head
  coach believes Wirtz can have a similar impact by following the example of
  Salah, who continues to set the standards at Liverpool and has scored nine
  goals in seven opening-day fixtures, a Premier League record. Slot was asked
  whether Wirtz was a signing to take Liverpool to the next level. “That is
  something I can only answer in the upcoming years,” he said. “Everything we
  expect is very positive, but between expecting and realising something is
  different. “Why are Messi and Ronaldo and Mo so highly regarded? Because they
  are always fit. Every single game they are fit and that is something that
  Florian first has to show in a league like ours. If he is able to stay fit
  then our fans will see great moments.” Liverpool paid a club record £100m to
  sign the attacking midfielder from Bayer Leverkusen and he could cost a
  British record £116m with add-ons. Slot, however, denies Wirtz is a statement
  signing by the club, who beat Bayern Munich and Manchester City to his
  signature. “Liverpool have done this before,” he said. “With Alisson Becker we
  spent so much money, with Virgil we spent so much money, and with inflation I
  think it is the [level of] Liverpool signing. We mainly make these signings.
  But we also sell players. If we make these signings, we also have to sell
  players. “He is a different profile to what we have. That is what we wanted –
  to bring a different profile in rather than adding something that we already
  had. It is very positive that we could bring in such a highly regarded player,
  but Liverpool has always been able to bring in these kinds of players.”
  Liverpool’s summer spending will pass the £300m mark when the 18-year-old
  defender Giovanni Leoni joins from Parma for an initial £26m. The club also
  want to add Marc Guéhi and Alexander Isak. On a summer of change at Anfield,
  Slot said: “I would have preferred Trent [Alexander-Arnold] to stay, but
  unfortunately he didn’t. Then you have to replace him. Then you have
  situations like Caoimhín Kelleher and Jarell Quansah. It is always hard for a
  player to have two or three seasons like this [not being a regular] in a row
  and if a player is not able to do this mentally then it is best to split ways
  and you have to replace. “The Luís Diaz and Darwin Núñez situations are quite
  clear so then you have to replace. I think we did that really well. From the
  options we could get we got all the ones we would like to bring in.”
