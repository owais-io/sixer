  On a squally winter night 21 years ago, 25-year-old Iraena Asher vanished from
  an isolated beach community, one hour west of New Zealand’s largest city,
  Auckland. “It was a terrible night like this,” Julia Woodhouse – one of the
  last to see Asher – tells the Guardian one afternoon in early July, as the
  rain lashes the windows of her Piha home. Asher had been partying at a house
  in Piha when she called police because she felt unsafe. When the police told
  Asher a taxi was on its way, she pleaded for them to send officers instead,
  telling them: “I can’t do this by myself”. That was the last time the police
  spoke with her. The taxi, meanwhile, went to the wrong address. Sometime after
  9pm, Woodhouse and her adult son picked up Asher, who was unknown to them,
  walking through the streets, lightly dressed, and took her home. There,
  Woodhouse and her late partner, Bobbie Carroll, tried to make Asher
  comfortable. She showered, put on Carroll’s blue robe, and ate, all the while
  begging the couple not to call the police. Woodhouse made up the couch – the
  same one she sits on today – into a bed for Asher, and turned out the lights
  just after midnight. “I hadn’t even got undressed and I heard a noise on the
  driveway,” Woodhouse says. She saw her son waving to Asher, trying to coax her
  back into the house. “He said, ‘Mum call the cops, there is something
  seriously wrong with this woman’.” Then, Asher fled. Another Piha couple last
  saw Asher raise her naked arms towards a streetlight, kiss the ground and turn
  towards the roaring beach. And then, the night swallowed her whole. Sign up:
  AU Breaking News email Asher’s story is one of New Zealand’s most enduring
  mysteries and has left a deep wound in Piha, but it is not the only one
  haunting the community. Five others have disappeared in the region over the
  past three decades. In 1992, Quentin Godwin, a curious and lively 18-year-old
  with bipolar disorder left his home in Titirangi, 30 minutes from Piha, and
  was never seen again. In 2012, Cherie Vousden, a 42-year-old mother,
  disappeared on the Mercer Bay loop track – a trail near Piha. She was last
  seen walking along the track with a bottle of wine. Three years later, Kim
  Bambus, a 21-year-old nurse from Auckland vanished on the same track, after
  telling her flatmates she was going there to run. An extensive search of the
  area led to nothing. In 2019, Guoquan (Laurence) Wu’s car was found at Piha,
  but the 22-year-old has never been seen again. His ex-girlfriend told the
  coroner he had expressed a desire to end his life, but Wu’s family did not
  believe he would deliberately harm himself. Then, in 2020, French student and
  keen hiker, Eloi Rolland, 18, was last seen walking the long road towards
  Piha, before he vanished. He had booked a flight home to France earlier than
  planned and had promised to bring home some of Piha’s black sand. Police
  believe he may have become lost in the bush surrounding the coast. No clothing
  or remains of any of the missing people have ever been found. The coroner
  found Bambus and Wu likely died by suicide, while Asher most likely drowned
  and Vousden likely fell to her death. The cause of Godwin’s death was
  inconclusive and Rolland’s case remains open. Little has connected the cases
  beyond the place they occurred, until a true-crime documentary changed that.
  Black Coast Vanishings, released in New Zealand in 2024 and now available in
  Australia on DocPlay, now asks: could these cases be linked? Are sinister
  forces at play? Do they warrant further investigation? Over four episodes,
  co-directors Candida Beveridge and Megan Jones interrogate the disappearances,
  interview family members and present theories and testimony from Piha locals
  to paint a picture of a small community grappling with tragedy, while pulsing
  with a troubling history of drugs, sexual violence and secrets. But tension
  has emerged in Piha over the series’ depiction of the cases. For some in the
  community, the series provided an opportunity to set their story straight, and
  reveal an undiscovered truth. But for others, Piha, with its tragedies and
  moody landscapes, had become the latest casualty of the wildly popular
  true-crime genre. ‘A community under speculation’ On an early July morning, on
  the road west from Auckland to Piha, large arterial routes give way to narrow
  winding roads and as houses recede, the vast Waitākere rainforest – cloaked in
  a low dense mist – closes in. When the rainforest thins, a smattering of
  houses appear, perched on the ridge lines, before the expansive west coast
  suddenly opens up. Lion Rock juts out of the shore, winged by the famous black
  sands of Piha. Imposing cliffs rear up from the ocean and the horizon fades
  into the grey-blue of the Tasman Sea. Any visitor to Piha will describe its
  majesty and its danger; how the membrane between the earthly and spiritual
  realms feels porous here. Standing on the cliffs is a statue, or pou, of
  Hinerangi, an early ancestor of the local tribe, Te Kawerau ā Maki. In the
  telling of Piha’s missing people, Hinerangi’s story is often referenced as a
  haunting echo. After her husband drowned fishing on the rocks, Hinerangi sat
  on the headland longing for his return. For days she waited until,
  heartbroken, she too disappeared to join the journey of the spirits. Roughly
  900 people live in Piha. Its residents are an eclectic mix of artists,
  surfers, people living off-grid, nature-lovers, families and a growing
  middle-class. Over summer, the population explodes with tourists, surfers and
  holidaymakers. Today, the settlement is quiet. A few people walk their dogs,
  and a group of surf club volunteers train in the pounding waves. The sand,
  whipped up by the wind, skips over the beach like sprites. “Piha is a really
  spiritual place,” shouts Peter Brown, the president of the south Piha surf
  club, over the elemental roar. “It has a lot of history, a lot of mana
  [presence].” It is beautiful and treacherous. Piha ranks as the country’s
  second-most dangerous ‘black spot’ for accidental drownings. It is “a big
  piece of water” and “very, very dangerous”, Brown says. When someone
  disappears, the club helps scour the coast for clues. Usually, the sea gives
  up the bodies and Brown knows enough about the currents to predict where they
  might emerge. If a body is damaged by rocks or sharks it may never surface,
  but even Brown, armed with this knowledge, cannot fathom the disappearances.
  “How can six people disappear and we can’t find them then and there, we can’t
  find them in a month … we can’t find them in 20 years? How can that ever be?”
  With no answers, the community started looking over their shoulders, Brown
  says. “It changed people’s comfort,” he says. “In a small place, everyone
  knows everyone, and everyone has a theory.” Some whisper those theories;
  others voice them loudly. Sir Bob Harvey, 85, the former long-running mayor of
  Waitākere, lifeguard and local stalwart was one of the first to propose a
  connection between some of the cases, in a piece written for Metro magazine in
  2018. Despite the coroner’s rulings, Harvey is convinced they have been
  abducted. “They have gone without a trace – without a shoe, without a bag,” he
  tells the Guardian. “Someone, or some people, out here know more.” Harvey
  features heavily throughout the series, suggesting “they all met foul play” –
  a theory he bases, in part, on no bodies being found and broad similarities in
  the appearances of those who have vanished. “They all look handsome,
  beautiful, gentle, kind, so if I have to believe there is a serial killer at
  work – I do, I do,” he says in the documentary. Speculation like this prompted
  Beveridge, a Piha-based British film-maker and Auckland-based Jones to make
  the series. They wanted to understand whether there was any legitimacy to the
  rumours, to learn how the tragedies had affected the families and the
  community and examine what the police might have missed. “It was kind of meant
  to be a portrait of a community under speculation,” Beveridge tells the
  Guardian. “This certainly wasn’t a flippant … superficial dive into what
  happened.” The directors started questioning whether other people had been
  involved and if there had been “a cover-up in the community” when four more
  people disappeared after Asher. The directors are aware of some community
  pushback against the series, but say they did not set out to prove there was a
  serial killer, or a connection between cases “although there were similarities
  between some of them, not least they all happened in the same small
  geographical area”. “What became clear from our investigations – and this is
  something we didn’t expect to emerge – was a pattern of women being stalked
  and predated on in the area,” Beveridge said. The series traversed the history
  of drug use and gang activity in the community and included accounts from
  women claiming they were chased, drugged and raped in Piha – testimonies the
  film-makers hoped would compel police to investigate the disappearances
  further. “It is really disappointing the police haven’t followed up a lot of
  what was in our series,” Jones says. The police declined the Guardian’s
  request for an interview but in a statement said they do not believe the
  incidents are linked and no tipoffs after the show aired warranted further
  investigation. *** True crime has become one of the most popular genres of
  books, documentary, TV and podcasts. While the public has always had an
  appetite for dark, “real life” mysteries, the current boom might be traced to
  the worldwide smash hit podcast Serial, which launched more than a decade ago,
  and spawned countless other popular crime series. But when true-crime turns
  its lens on an issue, communities can suddenly find themselves under a public
  microscope, watching as their most extreme stories, settings and personalities
  are offered up for entertainment. If not done carefully, it risks opening
  wounds for those who have lived through a tragedy, says Dr Gregory Stratton, a
  senior lecturer in criminology at RMIT. “There needs to be a purpose behind
  it, and if the purpose is just extractive … that can be really problematic for
  communities,” Stratton says. True crime can provide justice for victims or
  exonerate wrongfully convicted people, while allowing families and communities
  to share their stories, Stratton says. For audiences, meanwhile, the genre can
  be “sense-making”, and build our understanding of where dangers could possibly
  lie. It can also lead to an outsized fear of crime, Stratton says, one that
  feeds on fear and public anxiety “but is not necessarily about the realities
  of how crime happens every day”. Like any small community, rumours are rife in
  Piha and old grudges surface quickly. But a deeply ingrained sense of care is
  also evident, and the inference Piha may be harbouring dark secrets has riled
  people. Despite her misgivings about the series, Woodhouse does not regret
  appearing in the show. It was the first time she had a chance to say “out
  loud, and in public, that the police fucked up” Asher’s case. But portraying
  Piha as a dangerous place, she says – “It’s not what Piha is, and it’s
  certainly not what it is now”. It is a sentiment shared by others with deep
  ties to the area. Sandra Coney, a former investigative journalist and local
  politician said people now think of Piha as “a warped little community on the
  fringe of the Earth” – but that was wrong. “Everything is run by people at
  Piha, there is a huge volunteer ethic …. it’s a good-humoured, forgiving
  community.” Coney wrote to the New Zealand Film Commission in 2021 urging it
  to withdraw funding from the documentary project, warning its speculation was
  “tasteless and gratuitous”. “I knew enough about the cases to know that it was
  a beat up,” she says, sitting in her Titirangi home, surrounded by paintings
  of Piha. Further, Coney argues, it glosses over the issues of suicide –
  tragedies that cast a long shadow in Piha and nationally. “Because we have
  policies around not reporting on suicides in New Zealand, it has become
  hidden,” Coney says, adding that park rangers have responded to a high number
  of incidents over the years. New Zealand has one of the highest youth suicide
  rates in the OECD and a high rate of accidental fatal drownings. For Pita
  Turei, a Māori artist, film-maker and local iwi (tribal) advocate, those
  tragedies and the documentary have affected the community more than the
  disappearances. “The inference of the program as a whole is that there is a
  demon,” Turei says over coffee at the local cafe. “It’s bullshit for the
  purpose of sensationalism and attention,” he says. “We have to look at
  ourselves – not look at the landscape, not for a demon – but at ourselves.”
