  Vladimir Putin will face “very severe consequences” if he does not agree a
  ceasefire in the war in Ukraine at his summit with Donald Trump in Alaska, the
  US president said on Wednesday. Speaking after a call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  and other European leaders, including Britain’s Keir Starmer, Trump also
  suggested he would push for a second summit if his meeting with Putin goes
  well – this time including his Ukrainian counterpart. “If the first one goes
  OK, we’ll have a quick second one,” Trump told reporters in Washington. “I
  would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting
  between President Putin and President Zelenskyy and myself, if they’d like to
  have me there.” Trump did not provide a timeframe for a second meeting. He is
  to meet Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. The meeting will reportedly be
  held at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson, a military facility crucial to
  countering the Soviet Union during the height of the cold war. Asked if Russia
  would face consequences if Putin did not agree to stop the war after the
  Alaska meeting, Trump said: “Yes, they will … very severe consequences.” The
  president’s remarks followed what he described as a very good call with
  European leaders in which he consulted about the goal and strategy for his
  summit. He pleased Europe’s leadership by giving reassurances that a ceasefire
  was his priority and he would not make any territorial concessions without
  Kyiv’s full involvement. Trump’s approach at the video conference, as
  described by France’s Emmanuel Macron, appeared to reassure some of the
  leaders, who were making a final collective plea to the unpredictable US
  president that he had a duty to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty – and European
  security – at the talks. The European leaders spoke to Trump and his
  vice-president, JD Vance, in a hastily convened one-hour meeting in an effort
  to shape Trump’s negotiating strategy. Zelenskyy and European leaders have
  been excluded from the summit and fear that Trump, intent on fulfilling his
  election campaign guarantee that he could easily end the bloodshed in Ukraine,
  will make concessions that compromise Ukraine’s future sovereignty. But Trump
  underlined his promise that the summit was not in itself a substantive
  negotiation and was what he described as a “feel-out” to test Putin’s terms to
  sign a temporary ceasefire that would then lead to talks with Kyiv. Trump said
  it had been a very good call, and that he rated it 10 out of 10. Britain,
  France and Germany, co-chairs of the so-called “coalition of the willing”,
  later laid out their position on the talks, reiterating that international
  borders must not be changed by force, and insisting that Ukraine must have
  “robust and credible security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty
  and territorial integrity”. The three countries repeated that meaningful
  negotiations could happen only with a ceasefire in place, and called for
  Russia to face further economic sanctions if it did not agree to cease
  hostilities at the summit. Speaking alongside Zelenskyy in Berlin, the German
  chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe wanted Trump to be successful in
  Alaska but that it had made clear to the US president that Ukrainian and
  European interests had to be protected at the summit. Merz called for a 30-day
  ceasefire, and then substantive talks. Putin has resisted a ceasefire for
  months. Setting out the key principles on which Europe is united he said:
  “Negotiations must be part of a common transatlantic strategy. Then they can
  ultimately be most likely to succeed. This strategy must continue to rely on
  strong support for Ukraine and necessary pressure against Russia. This also
  means, if there is no movement on the Russian side in Alaska, then the United
  States and we Europeans should … increase the pressure.” He added that there
  could not be any Russian legal ownership of Ukrainian territory. “President
  Trump knows this position, he shares it very extensively and therefore I can
  say we have had a really exceptionally constructive and good conversation with
  each other.” Macron said no serious discussions had taken place about
  Russian-Ukrainian land swaps involving the ceding of Ukrainian territory, and
  Trump had anyway underlined that any such discussions could only be negotiated
  with Kyiv. He said Trump would fight for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine,
  the US and Russia and that such a meeting would be held in Europe. One
  European diplomat said: “Overall the meeting was reassuring in that our points
  came across, but the question remains whether Trump will stick to the agreed
  script when he gets into the room with Putin.” Trump met heads of state and
  government leaders from Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Poland and Finland, as
  well as the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The issue of
  security guarantees for Ukraine was raised in the call with Trump, but no
  breakthrough was made in the US offering to provide practical support to the
  coalition. But the Europeans’ main objective had been to seek reassurances
  from the notoriously fickle Trump that he would not be lured into making
  irretrievable pledges requiring Ukraine to make concessions of land as the
  price for securing Putin’s agreement to a ceasefire. They also tried to
  extract assurances that Trump was still prepared to deploy as yet unused
  economic levers that could damage Russian revenues. European leaders have been
  careful in public to welcome Trump’s summit but in private fear Trump is bent
  on improving US-Russia relations and sees a loss of Ukrainian sovereignty as a
  necessary and unavoidable price to secure that objective. Trump has been vague
  about his strategy, including the terms he will offer to induce Putin to agree
  to a ceasefire. Zelenskyy has vowed that the Ukrainian military will not
  voluntarily surrender territory in Donetsk and Luhansk, but Russia is
  insisting at least four Ukrainian regions will become Russian either at the
  negotiating table or through force. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump vented his
  fury at media reporting of his meeting with Putin, writing on Truth Social:
  “The media is being really, really unfair about my meeting with Putin. They
  keep quoting fired losers and really stupid people like John Bolton, who just
  said that even though the meeting is on US soil, ‘Putin has already won’. What
  the hell is this? We win EVERYTHING.” The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,
  said further sanctions or secondary tariffs could yet be placed on Russia’s
  trading partners if the Alaska meeting did not go well. A confident Moscow
  dismissed the importance of Europe’s consultation with Trump. The foreign
  ministry spokesperson Alexei Fadeyev said: “We consider the consultations
  requested by the Europeans to be politically and practically insignificant
  actions. Verbally, the Europeans support the diplomatic efforts of Washington
  and Moscow to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, but in reality the European Union
  is sabotaging them.” Russia says the Alaska meeting is likely to address the
  full gamut of Russian-American bilateral relations, and not just Ukraine. “We
  hope that this meeting will allow the leaders to focus on the full range of
  issues, from the crisis in Ukraine to the obstacles that hinder normal and
  constructive dialogue, which is crucial to ensuring international peace and
  stability,” the spokesperson said. The veteran Russian foreign minister,
  Sergei Lavrov, will be present at the talks.
