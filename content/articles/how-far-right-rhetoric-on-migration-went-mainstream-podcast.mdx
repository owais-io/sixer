webTitle: How far-right rhetoric on migration went mainstream – podcast

  This summer, as Nosheen Iqbal observes, politicians seem to have started
  saying things about refugees and migrants that would have been unsayable a
  decade ago. Whether it is the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick,
  writing that he would not want his daughters living near ‘men from backward
  countries who broke into Britain illegally’, or Reform MPs claiming women in
  the UK are at risk of being assaulted by men from ‘predominantly Muslim
  countries’, something seems to have shifted in the way politicians talk about
  asylum and migration. Dr Maya Goodfellow analyses this worrying trend in
  British politics that goes all the way up to the government, with politicians
  frequently adopting the language of the far right, and identifying asylum
  seekers as criminal and a threat to young women and girls.
