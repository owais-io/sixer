  When Ari Emanuel – the notorious Hollywood powerbroker and CEO of TKO Holdings
  Group, which owns both the UFC and WWE – made a rare media appearance on the
  Pat McAfee Show in February 2025, he offered cryptic remarks about the state
  of boxing. Though typically cagey, Emanuel hinted, “Who knows what’s going to
  happen with the Ali Act” – a reference to the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act,
  a federal law designed to protect the rights and welfare of boxers. Since
  then, rumors have swirled that TKO is quietly working to amend the law to make
  way for its newly minted boxing venture with Saudi Arabia. Last week, those
  rumors were confirmed when US representatives Brian Jack, a Republican from
  Georgia, and Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas, introduced the Muhammad
  Ali American Boxing Revival Act in Congress. The proposed bill is being touted
  by the congressional representatives as a much-needed modernization of federal
  regulations in professional boxing, adding new provisions to the 1996
  Professional Boxing Safety Act and introducing “alternatives” to the
  sanctioning bodies overseeing the sport. “I am incredibly proud to introduce
  the bipartisan Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act, which provides boxers
  with more opportunities, better pay, and greater safety standards,” Jack said
  in the press release. “Professional boxing is the only sport regulated by
  Congress, and ambiguity in current law – adopted over a quarter-century ago –
  has stifled investment. Congressional action is needed to revive this
  once-great American sport, and this bipartisan legislation establishes a
  framework for innovation to flourish.” The “stifled investment” that Jack is
  referencing in his statement is TKO’s new boxing venture with Sela, an
  entertainment subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), and
  Turki al-Sheikh, the figure behind Saudi’s General Entertainment Authority and
  a close confidant of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The new venture, dubbed
  Zuffa Boxing, will debut on 13 September 2025, with an anticipated super
  middleweight showdown between Saul ‘Canelo’ Álvarez and Terence Crawford. An
  expanded boxing promotion will likely follow in 2026. Backed by the Saudi
  government’s enormous resources, Emanuel’s company advocated for the bill in
  Congress, including provisions to created alternatives to long-established
  sanctioning bodies like the World Boxing Organization (WBO) and World Boxing
  Council (WBC). The proposed alternatives in the legislation are known as
  Unified Boxing Organizations (UBOs), which is what Zuffa Boxing will likely
  operate as. While framed as a “framework for innovation”, Zuffa Boxing
  empowers Saudi Arabia to establish a parallel boxing ecosystem where it has
  sole determination over fighter ranking and championship belts. This paves the
  way for Saudi to bypass established sanctioning bodies, undermine existing
  promoters, and ultimately, gut professional boxing. “This is a concerning bill
  for professional boxers,” said Erik Magraken, a combat sports regulatory
  lawyer and founder of combatsportslaw.com. “It guts the key protections from
  the Ali Act for promoters that choose to use the ‘unified boxing organization’
  model. It allows a promoter to control rank and title … and achieve a
  stranglehold on the sport.” The bill also sets out a series of compliance
  requirements for UBOs, including minimum per‑round payments and safety
  provisions such as mandatory medical examinations and expanded health
  insurance. While these measures could, in theory, benefit up‑and‑coming
  boxers, they also create significant barriers to entry for smaller boxing
  organizations attempting to establish UBOs. Zuffa Boxing, backed by Saudi
  funding, would be well‑positioned to dominate this space, attract new
  fighters, and establish a new hierarchy in the sport – one in which TKO
  effectively determines who holds the world titles. This new model for boxing
  is based almost entirely on the structure of the UFC, an organization that has
  long been criticized for its exploitation of fighters in its pursuit of
  profit. Fitting since UFC CEO Dana White, a longtime friend of US president
  Donald Trump, is expected to lead the new Zuffa Boxing venture. “Everybody
  knows the format – the best fight the best,” White said in interview with The
  Ring, the boxing magazine owned by Al-Sheikh and, by extension, the Saudi
  government. “You work your way up the rankings, and once somebody breaks into
  the top five [and] there is no question [about] who the best five guys are in
  each weight class, they fight it out. And once somebody holds that belt, you
  don’t need three letters in front of the belt. Whoever has that belt is the
  best in the world in that weight class. It’s a very simple model.” Despite
  generating billions in revenue, the UFC pays its athletes a significantly
  smaller share compared to other major sports leagues. While NFL and NBA
  players receive close to 50% of league revenues, UFC fighters earn roughly 15%
  to 18%, with many on the roster making as little as $10,000 to $20,000 per
  fight – amounts that barely cover training costs, coaching and medical
  expenses. Efforts to unionize or challenge these inequities have been quashed
  by the UFC, which has used long-term, exclusive contracts and its market
  dominance to keep fighters in line. Last year, the UFC agreed to a $375m
  settlement with several hundred fighters to resolve an antitrust lawsuit. The
  plaintiffs accused the promotion of stifling economic competition and using
  its monopoly power to suppress fighter pay. While the UFC denied any
  wrongdoing, the underlying claims remain central to a separate, ongoing case.
  When Congress passed the Ali Act in 2000, it was in response to the unfair and
  anti-competitive practices rampant in pro boxing at the time. The sport was
  dominated by influential promoters, corrupt sanctioning bodies and coercive
  contracts. The Ali Act provided federally-backed oversight and enforcement
  meant to reduce the exploitation of fighters through transparency mandates and
  financial disclosure requirements. The legislation passed with unanimous
  bipartisan support and stands as the only example of Congress attempting to
  directly regulate a professional sport in the United States. While the
  Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act does not repeal the Ali Act, it does
  pave the way for new organizations to emerge outside of the purview of current
  sanctioning bodies, effectively bringing the UFC model to boxing. It is
  unclear when the bill will reach the House floor, as Congress will be in
  recess through the entirety of August. Nevertheless, the bill has received
  support from Ali’s widow, Lonnie Ali, who was quoted in the press release as
  saying that “Muhammad would be proud to have his name associated with this
  bill.” Davids, who co-sponsored the bill, was also a former MMA fighter who
  once tried out as a contestant for The Ultimate Fighter – a reality show that
  places fighters in a mansion for several weeks as they work their way through
  a tournament for a “six-figure UFC contract”. Their involvement in the bill is
  a masterstroke of lobbying tactics by TKO and Emanuel. “The Ali Act was
  created to stop coercive and exploitative practices by promoters. It was
  designed to make a monopolization of the sport not possible. Independent rank
  and title are the key reasons why pro boxers can command such great purses
  compared to MMA athletes,” Magraken said. “Boxers compete for titles.
  Promoters compete for boxers. If promoters own and control titles then boxers
  can be exploited by promoters.” This will be remarkably beneficial to Saudi
  Arabia and Al-Sheikh, who have invested billions to wrest control of boxing
  from its traditional masters. Al-Sheikh has bankrolled some of the most
  high-profile heavyweight fights and broken through negotiation stalemates by
  offering record-breaking sums of money. His success as a promoter has made him
  one of the sport’s most powerful figures, while fans and media affectionately
  refer to him as “His Excellency” – a title that underscores his growing cult
  of personality. Al-Sheikh’s expanding influence has stifled criticism within
  boxing. Fans are willing to overlook troubling behavior as long as he
  continues to deliver exciting matchups, while journalists, eager to maintain
  their critical access, often frame the narrative in his favor. The kingdom
  also owns its own boxing magazine and deploys a vast network of PR firms and
  executives to advance its political agenda through sports. It is yet another
  reminder of Saudi Arabia’s broader strategy in sports – a blueprint built on
  acquiring influence, shaping narratives and establishing self-sustaining
  ecosystems under its control. Boxing may be the ideal asset to complete that
  vision. Karim Zidan writes a regular newsletter on the intersection of sports
  and authoritarian politics.
