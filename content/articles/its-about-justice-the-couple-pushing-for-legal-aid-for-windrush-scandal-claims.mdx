  The Home Office’s refusal to renew the UK passports of a Black British former
  servicewoman and her husband had “devastating” consequences over decades,
  years after Enoch Powell’s NHS recruitment drive brought their mothers to
  Britain. Hetticia and Vanderbilt McIntosh had their UK status revoked in the
  1970s and 1980s, through no fault of their own. The married parents of three
  were forced to start again in St Lucia, more than 4,000 miles away. The Home
  Office only gave the couple new British passports in 2020 – after news emerged
  of the Windrush scandal, which involved the wrongful deportation and denial of
  rights to Black, Caribbean and African-born Britons living legally in the UK
  over decades. Despite the significant disruption to their family life, NHS
  care and pensions, the McIntoshes were each refused compensation from the
  Windrush compensation scheme three times between 2021 and this year. In 2019,
  Windrush scandal survivors were told there would be “no cap” on payments.
  Instead, the scheme has been plagued by knockbacks, delays and desultory
  offers. Hetticia was eventually offered £40,000 this year after Southwark Law
  Centre, a registered charity, took on her case. However, Vanderbilt has
  received a “nil offer”. Even though the Home Office has admitted its error by
  giving him his British passport back, officials say he does not qualify for
  compensation because he entered the country as a “visitor” in 1993 – the only
  way he could at the time. In April, the government launched the £1.5m Windrush
  compensation advocacy support scheme to “provide claimants with dedicated
  advocates from community organisations” to support applications. But
  Hetticia’s experience has convinced her that only expert lawyers can tackle
  the system. She has refused her compensation offer and started a change.org
  petition for legal aid for Windrush scandal survivors, which has been signed
  by nearly 20,000 people. She has also been lobbying politicians in the
  Caribbean to raise awareness. Research this year revealed claimants received
  huge increases in compensation offers – in one case jumping from £300 to
  £170,000 – after legal advice. The McIntoshes, who now live in Manchester,
  first entered the UK as British subjects and small children before obtaining
  British passports. Hetticia’s mother was a Barbadian nurse employed by
  Manchester Royal Infirmary as part of an early-1960s NHS recruitment drive by
  the then Conservative health secretary, Enoch Powell, which primarily targeted
  Caribbean nurses and Indian doctors. Vanderbilt’s mother was recruited from St
  Lucia as a midwife for Newham, east London, in the same period, while his
  father worked for Ford in Dagenham. Several years later Powell was dismissed
  from the Tory shadow cabinet after giving his inflammatory 1968 “rivers of
  blood” speech, which became one of modern British history’s most divisive
  addresses. Hetticia’s UK passport expired in 1973 while she was serving as an
  army physical training instructor, and in 1978 the Home Office said she was
  not entitled to a new one because her birth country, Barbados, had become
  independent from Britain. When Vanderbilt’s passport expired in 1984, he was
  told he no longer qualified because of St Lucia’s independence. Hetticia was
  advised to get a Barbadian passport, which UK officials stamped with “right to
  abode”, but Vanderbilt, whose grandfather was Scottish, was not given any UK
  immigration status. Suddenly unable to prove he could work legally, he lost
  his job at Berger Paints, which cost the couple their east London home.
  Vanderbilt moved the family to St Lucia in 1985, feeling “rejected and forced
  out”, which, Hetticia said, nearly destroyed their marriage and forced them to
  travel back and forth for decades. The couple’s frustration at their ordeal is
  compounded by its inconsistencies – their parents and siblings kept their
  status, while their own children, as British-born citizens, were able to
  return to the UK to study and work in the mid-1990s. Hetticia said: “You feel
  devastated because one day you don’t know who you are any more. We were born
  British, how is it that was taken away from us? “The Home Office’s behaviour
  is very insidious and further traumatising us. They pretend they’re helping
  you, but they’re not. What they’ve offered me is an insult. There are
  [Windrush scandal survivors] who are homeless, suffering from dementia, or
  paralysed with fear. They need legal help. This is not about compensation –
  it’s about justice.” About 18,000 people have been given new documents
  confirming their status or British citizenship since the scandal broke. A Home
  Office spokesperson said the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was “determined to
  put right the appalling injustices caused by the Windrush scandal”, make sure
  people received the compensation they rightly deserved and ensure permanent
  “cultural change” at the department.
