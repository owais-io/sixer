  Over the past six months, Donald Trump has been accused of rapidly dragging
  the largest democracy in the Americas towards authoritarianism. Now, the US
  president seems bent on undermining the region’s second largest democracy too.
  Since early July, Trump has launched an extraordinary attack on Brazil’s
  institutions, slapping 50% tariffs on imports from the South American country
  and sanctions on a supreme court judge – partly in retribution for what he
  called the political persecution of his ally, Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial
  for allegedly masterminding a failed coup. “Rarely since the end of the cold
  war has the United States interfered so deeply with a Latin American country,”
  the Economist declared last week. “I feel for the Brazilians,” said Steven
  Levitsky, the Harvard University political scientist who co-wrote How
  Democracies Die, a bestselling book about democratic erosion. “This is a very
  authoritarian political force that’s doing enormous damage to my country’s
  democratic institutions and rights – and I wish it would stop at that. It’s
  painful to see the [US] government do damage to other countries’ democratic
  institutions as well.” The US has an ignominious track record of interfering
  in Latin American affairs, through CIA-backed coups and military
  interventions. But Levitsky said he had never seen trade policy weaponized in
  such a way: “Brazilians have worked now for generations to build the
  strongest, most democratic system they’ve ever had … and this sort of
  reckless, casual assault on democratic institutions pains me.” Trump’s effort
  to help Bolsonaro dodge justice over his alleged 2022 coup, by pressuring
  Brazil’s government and supreme court, has thrilled the ex-president’s
  supporters. They see Trump as Bolsonaro’s best chance of avoiding jail when
  the supreme court announces its verdict in the coming weeks. But Trump’s
  meddling has infuriated millions of Brazilians from across the political
  spectrum who are appalled at what they call an intolerable foreign ploy to
  subvert their democracy, 40 years after it was restored after two decades of
  dictatorship. “In the old days they’d send in the marines. Now they impose
  tariffs,” said Rubens Ricupero, a former finance minister and ambassador to
  Washington, who predicted that Trump’s behaviour would provoke a wave of
  anti-US nationalism. Marcelo Rubens Paiva, an author and pro-democracy
  campaigner whose father was murdered by Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship, called
  Trump’s “utterly unspeakable” interference the fruit of “a man who feels he is
  Napoleon and wants the entire world to kneel down before him”. Observers are
  split on what is driving Trump’s assault on Brazil’s institutions and
  democratically elected government, which the White House this week declared a
  threat to “the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
  States”. Some suspect he hopes to expand Latin America’s pro-Trump rightwing
  axis – currently led by Argentina’s Javier Milei and El Salvador’s Nayib
  Bukele – by reviving Bolsonaro’s waning political career and, perhaps,
  returning the far-right populist to power in next year’s presidential
  election. Others see Trump’s pro-Bolsonaro pressure campaign as a smokescreen
  for his true objectives: furthering US economic interests and, in particular,
  those of tech giants desperate to avoid regulation in the world’s
  fifth-largest online market. Levitsky saw a simpler explanation. Trump’s
  offensive was the product of a president who acted like a “classic
  20th-century tinpot dictator”, such as the Dominican Republic’s Rafael
  Trujillo or Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza. “Trump approaches governance in
  exactly the same way. The treasury was for them. Trade policy was for them.
  Foreign policy was for them. The army was their personal security. That’s how
  Trump looks at governance. He uses policy instruments for his own personal and
  political ends,” Levitsky said. “There’s no economic strategy here. Very
  clearly there’s no foreign policy strategy here. But Bolsonaro’s family has
  gotten into Trump’s inner circle and convinced him that Bolsonaro’s plight is
  similar to his plight in 2020 [after he lost the election to Joe Biden].
  “Trump believes – falsely – that he was subjected to a witch-hunt and he’s
  been convinced by Bolsonaro’s sons that Bolsonaro, like him, is also subject
  to a witch-hunt. And he’s using US foreign policy – tragically, pathetically –
  to pursue those personal whims,” Levitsky said. Experts doubt Trump will
  succeed. Bolsonaro, already banned from seeking election until 2030, is
  expected to receive a hefty sentence when the coup trial concludes. Bolsonaro
  denies the charges but has admitted considering “alternative ways” to stop the
  winner of Brazil’s 2022 election, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking office.
  Paiva believed Trump wanted Bolsonaro to secure the same kind of impunity he
  enjoyed after trying to overturn the 2020 election result. But the ruse
  appeared to be backfiring. Early signs suggest President Lula has been
  energized by the tug-of-war with Trump while the Bolsonaro family, who many
  blame for convincing Trump to target Brazil’s economy and institutions, have
  suffered a public backlash. In a recent editorial, the conservative Estado de
  São Paulo newspaper declared: “Bolsonaro’s name has already been inscribed in
  the pantheon of the greatest traitors this nation has ever seen.” “I think
  Bolsonaro has buried his political career,” Paiva said.
