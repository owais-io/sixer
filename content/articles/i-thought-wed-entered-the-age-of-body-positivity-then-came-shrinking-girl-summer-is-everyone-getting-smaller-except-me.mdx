  It is a balmy evening in early July. I have finally managed to get both of my
  small children to sleep and I am engaging in what has become a new and
  unhealthy ritual: scrolling through Instagram and trying to work out which of
  the people behind accounts I once followed for their body positivity content
  are now taking weight-loss drugs. I take a break from scrolling to pinch
  layers of fat between my thumb and middle finger, willing them – as I have
  since I was a child – to disappear. My fingertips trace the folds of skin that
  have appeared between my hips and ribs since my youngest son was born last
  summer, then over the raised red zigzags that have emerged all over my tummy
  since I first began growing children in 2021. By the time my partner has made
  his way up to our room, I am sobbing. His face bears the slightly pained but
  loving expression of someone who has seen this all before. Without a word, he
  draws me in for a hug before taking the phone from me. “I just … ” I say
  between sobs. He nods as I finish my sentence “… wish it were me.” You’d be
  forgiven for finding this melodramatic. But at 37, I can count on one hand the
  years I have spent free from anxiety about the shape and size of my body – and
  two of them I spent pregnant. The rest of my time on the planet has involved
  either outright hating my body or – more recently, in the shadow of the body
  positivity movement – trying to accept and maybe even love it. But something
  is changing. Gone are the days when there was a deluge of messaging that told
  us to love our bodies no matter their size. When brands were falling over
  themselves in the who-can-shout-self-love-the-loudest Olympics. When Vogue,
  once a shrine to the skinny, declared three plus-size women were the new
  supers and plastered them on the cover. Instead, in a change I’d never have
  believed possible just two years ago, we have somehow been thrust back into a
  noughties-level skinny worship culture that is bringing up the same feelings
  I’ve been running from since I was a girl. * * * If first there was Hot Girl
  Summer, then Brat Summer, I reckon we are now living through Shrinking Girl
  Summer. I say this with no judgment or malice, but simply to hold up a mirror
  to a pervasive trend. Quietly, everyone seems to have been getting smaller and
  smaller. For Alex Light, a British body-positive influencer, things had
  started to change even before the arrival on the mass market in the UK and US
  of GLP-1 agonist drugs used exclusively, via prescription, for weight loss
  (before this they were used mainly to treat symptoms of type-2 diabetes,
  including obesity). “For a while there were subtle signs,” Light says. “Fewer
  size-inclusive launches, less campaign imagery, more brands quietly reducing
  size ranges and a shift in which kinds of bodies were getting visibility and
  praise … but weight-loss drugs have made this shift impossible to ignore.” The
  signs are everywhere. Dozens of A-list women who were once (intentionally or
  not) symbols of what it means to rebel against diet culture are now changing
  shape dramatically. First Adele. Then Rebel Wilson. Lizzo. Meghan Trainor.
  Kelly Clarkson. Serena Williams. Mindy Kaling. And although some of these
  attribute their weight loss to strict diet and exercise, others are openly
  using the jabs: plenty of once overweight A-listers have been explicit about
  how much they’ve benefited from using the jabs, with Robbie Williams calling
  them a “Christmas miracle” in a 2023 interview. Others, such as Queer Eye’s
  Jonathan Van Ness and Oprah Winfrey, have spoken openly about their use – not,
  they say, in the pursuit of skinniness, but to get to what they feel is a
  healthier, more comfortable weight. Given this is such a personal and emotive
  subject for many, it is obvious the reasons for using these drugs to slim down
  aren’t always black and white. But it is also clear there’s a grey area
  between “feeling fat” and being fat. And with stories of already-slim fashion
  editors queueing up to microdose the drugs in the run-up to fashion week, and
  celebrities using them to maintain skinny physiques, it’s almost impossible to
  find an exit to the moral maze of who should use them and how. What is
  increasingly evident is that the lessons we’ve been taught in the past 10
  years – you can be healthy in a bigger body, and some bodies are genetically
  meant to be larger – are being replaced with the old-fashioned idea that
  health equates with thinness. Over on TikTok, the SkinnyTok hashtag – on
  content praising thinness and starvation in the pursuit of it – was banned in
  June because of a surge in its popularity and glamorisation of disordered
  eating. Coupled with a return of a familiar prejudice that fat people are just
  lazy and greedy – a problem that needs solving, for the sake of the NHS – it
  feels bleaker than it has for a long time to be overweight. As a perennially
  plus-size woman, I am happy for anyone who manages to lose weight and keep it
  off. But, yes, I am also consumed with a furious jealousy, because I wish it
  were me. And it almost was – because I am not simply an observer of this
  sudden collective sprint towards thinness, but someone who actively tried to
  participate in it. Reader: I took the drugs, too. * * * My experience with
  being bigger than I ought to be started as a child. I cannot say for sure when
  I was first made aware of my “problem”, but by the age of 10 I could
  confidently tell you how many calories were in a slice of Hovis versus
  Sainsbury’s own bread, and was a whiz at inputting my school dinners into the
  Weight Watchers calculator I carried around in my pocket. My memory is hazy
  about precisely when the weight-loss conversation was first opened with me,
  but I know it has never been closed. The word “conversation” is a stretch,
  given it has generally travelled in one direction only: towards me. The usual
  protocol is me receiving opinions about my body from people who, in either a
  personal or professional capacity, ask if I’ve ever considered losing weight,
  before gently suggesting I might want to, or demanding I do. This will come
  with recommendations to try this one thing this thin person determines is the
  reason for their svelte physique, never admitting their genes might have
  something to do with it. And my role in this little dance has been to swallow
  the shame I feel about my body, while apologising for the awkwardness my size
  seems to present for everyone else. And so the explosion of the so-called body
  positivity movement, on our social media feeds, fashion websites, catwalks and
  deodorant adverts worldwide, came as a shock to me. Having spent my whole life
  trying to be or stay thin, its messaging was at odds with my internal
  programming. While it felt amazing to see someone like Tess Holliday on the
  cover of Cosmo, and curvier mannequins in Nike’s flagship Oxford Street store,
  it also felt at times like two steps forward, one step back. I wasn’t
  surprised to witness fatness become the latest target of the rightwing press’s
  war on “wokeness”, or explicit fatphobia, normalised by columnists “debating”
  what they saw as the glorification of ill health. And while I loved the idea
  of appreciating your body regardless of its shape or size, I also knew deep
  down that I would probably never be able to do so myself. Nonetheless, I gave
  it a good go. I wrote fat-positive pieces, shared posts on Instagram with body
  positivity hashtags and enjoyed the availability of bigger clothes in brands I
  had longed to wear: Valentino, D&amp;G, Ganni, Reformation. I fell in love
  with the fat influencers’ “big is beautiful” message. I loved seeing people
  celebrating their bodies, especially their perceived flaws. I even wondered
  whether I had actually managed to love my body in its overweight (and later
  clinically obese) state, but this illusion of acceptance would always unravel
  at the merest perceived criticism – from online trolls or well-meaning people
  in my life trying to help solve something I’d never identified to them as a
  problem. A few things did change for the better for me. Where once my
  internalised fatphobia had prevented me from believing fat people could be
  attractive, now seeing gorgeous curvy women in ads and on catwalks stretched
  my own definition of beauty to include people in bigger bodies. Another is
  that I fell in love with exercise, once it stopped being something gatekept by
  the skinny and muscular – with special admission granted for fat people only
  if they were explicitly trying to become thin. Instead it became much more
  common to see women above a size eight enjoy exercise for the sake of exercise
  – in my case, kickboxing, running and swimming. The last big shift was that,
  for the first time in my life, I was able to believe that, despite my
  inability to be thin, I was deserving of real and unconditional love, which
  allowed me to crack open a little door just enough to let a person enter who
  would become my husband and the father of my children. I am much more able to
  accept my body’s appearance than I ever was before I met him. When GLP-1
  agonists first came along, I instinctively felt afraid. And curious. Afraid
  because when Meghan Trainor was singing about how it’s all about that bass and
  Lizzo was casting only plus-size dancers for her tours, I had allowed myself
  to imagine a future in which the issue of weight wouldn’t be such a big deal.
  Curious because, well … I wondered if the drugs could help me. After having my
  second baby last summer, I gained weight. I was exhausted, moving less, eating
  more, and I felt out of control. So when articles started appearing around
  Christmas about how easy the injections were, how much weight you could lose
  and how few side-effects they produced, an idea started to form in my mind:
  maybe they could be the thing that slammed the door shut on conversations
  about my weight once and for all, and cut out the dreaded “food noise” – a
  near-constant barrage of thoughts about food, even when not physically hungry,
  that had an obsessive grip on my psyche. The idea of removing that from my
  life wasn’t just tantalising, but almost unthinkable. Imagine what I could do
  with all that extra brain space. I took the agonists and they worked – almost
  too well. I lost my entire appetite and about 15kg in a scarily fast time.
  Simultaneously, I experienced a resurgence of crippling anxiety (a known
  side-effect of Wegovy), leaving me foggy-headed, sweating profusely, sleepless
  and unable to think rationally or be fully present with my tiny children. It
  was truly miserable for me and my partner, who found it heartbreaking to see
  his formerly happy and engaged wife spiral back into the postnatal obsessive
  compulsive disorder we had both worked so hard to help me recover from after
  our first son’s birth. Not for the first time in my life, the choice of being
  thin and mentally unwell, or overweight and mostly contented, presented
  itself. There was only one viable answer: I needed to be well for my children,
  and if that meant mostly tolerating body dissatisfaction, then better the
  devil you know, right? The online company that had prescribed me the drugs
  with an eerie lack of checks and balances was stumped when I reported my
  side-effects, and told me to stop taking them. By this point I was so
  desperate to feel like myself again that the 3kg I regained pretty quickly,
  simply by eating more than nothing at all, barely registered. But as I felt
  more and more like myself, a new, almost grief-like feeling settled in the pit
  of my stomach; I felt defeated. The life raft on which I had pinned all my
  hopes of saving myself from a life of body hatred had arrived, and I had
  fallen spectacularly off it. It confirmed that the chronic lack of self-esteem
  I knew was likely the underlying cause of my mental health issues wasn’t ever
  going to be magically solved. And that I would probably never be free of a
  life spent oscillating wildly between two extremes: happy or thin. * * * You
  may be wondering where this all leaves me. Like many others, I suspect, it’s
  extremely complicated. Do I, an obese person, wish I could tolerate the drugs
  better and lose a phenomenal amount of weight like seemingly everyone else
  has? Yes! Do I feel foolish for believing this one thing might solve all my
  problems? Absolutely. But there’s another niggling sense, too: a feeling that
  I have been lied to, tricked into hoping an alternative world could exist in
  which people were more accepting of each other’s bodies. I felt foolish for
  not recognising that what I will now refer to as fat-washing had only served
  one purpose: to make companies more money. I feel disappointed that the same
  people who told me I was beautiful despite my size have jumped at the first
  chance to be thin – and it makes me question their past sincerity. As Light
  says, “When a creator builds a platform based on inclusivity and body
  acceptance, their followers see that as a safe space. When that same creator’s
  body visibly changes, it can feel like a betrayal.” This has made me question
  my own integrity. I was out there spreading the good word of self-acceptance,
  too. Did I really believe what I was saying? I certainly wanted it to be true,
  and hoped it would be for others, and maybe that’s the same thing. But I know
  if I had the opportunity to be thin, even if it meant upsetting others, I’d
  say yes, every single time, because I’m so bone-achingly tired of the feeling
  of not-enoughness (or too-muchness) that has lingered since I was a girl.
  Siobhan Murphy, a plus-size influencer whose @ interiorcurve socials focus on
  fashion and interiors, knows this predicament well. She was “so nervous” to
  share her use of Mounjaro, a GLP-1 agonist, because she’s “always been a loud
  and proud advocate” for plus-size women. “I worried people might feel let down
  or think I’d changed sides,” she says. “But this wasn’t about how I looked –
  I’ve always loved my body. It was about how I felt in it. My back kept
  bothering me, my knees were aching, my skin was dull, my eyes puffy … I made
  the decision to prioritise my health, and I’m glad I did.” Despite her
  apprehension, Murphy’s followers “have been incredibly kind and understanding.
  I think many were just happy I was transparent. There’s such secrecy around
  this topic.” In an online environment, a lack of trust can quickly morph into
  something more sinister, encouraging people to look at everyone and wonder if
  they’re on it, too, in a weird cat-and-mouse game that breathes life into an
  old habit of commenting on women’s bodies that, as a society, we’ve fought to
  move on from. And as someone who’s been round the block when it comes to
  weight gain and loss, body dysmorphia and the rest, I can tell you nothing
  makes you feel worse about yourself than scrutinising the appearance of
  others. As I scroll Instagram, seeing Shrinking Girl Summer in full bloom, I
  can’t help but pine for what could have been: a smaller body and what I assume
  would be an easier existence than one spent feeling the need to justify and
  defend myself all the time. But I find reasons to be hopeful when I see new
  body positivity pioneers pushing back against this fresh era of fatphobia.
  Women such as Lena Dunham, Meg Stalter, CMAT and Lola Young, who are all
  having their moment in the sun, without feeling the need to shrink in order to
  do so. Murphy says she sees the community at a crossroads. “A new wave of
  medical intervention is changing the conversation and it has raised many
  questions about what body positivity truly means. For me, it was never just
  about size – it’s about acceptance and kindness toward yourself and others.
  Whether you stay the same size, gain weight or lose it, the core message
  should remain the same: your worth isn’t defined by your body.” I am pretty
  committed to losing some weight; not a lot, but some. More than anything
  because I want to feel better in my body. My pursuit of being smaller is not
  motivated by a belief that being big and being beautiful are mutually
  exclusive. Maybe it will always be something I can appreciate as being true
  for others rather than myself, but in the meantime, I’ll do all I can to embed
  in my children’s own programming the notion that their weight really is the
  least interesting thing about them. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from
  having kids, it’s that the best way to teach them something is to embody it.
  I’ve never felt a stronger urge to step away from the scroll hole and build
  more solid self-esteem from the inside out. Maybe I’ll never learn to love my
  body fully, but that doesn’t mean I’ll give up trying. • This article was
  amended on 11 August 2025 to clarify that while drugs like Mounjaro have
  inhibitory qualities, GLP-1 drugs are more accurately called agonists, not
  inhibitors.
