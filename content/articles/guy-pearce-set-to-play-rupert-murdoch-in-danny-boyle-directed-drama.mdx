  Danny Boyle is set to direct an adaptation of award-winning play Ink, based on
  the rise of the Rupert Murdoch empire. According to Deadline, Guy Pearce is in
  talks to take on the lead role with Jack O’Connell also in negotiations to
  star as Larry Lamb, who Murdoch hired to run the Sun in the late 1960s. The
  film will be written by original playwright James Graham, whose other screen
  credits include recent TV drama Brian and Maggie. Ink was a critical hit after
  it premiered on stage in 2017 going on to win an Olivier award and two Tonys.
  The Guardian’s Michael Billington called it a “gripping piece of theatre”.
  Murdoch previously referred to Boyle as “a creative genius” on social media
  after the London Olympics opening ceremony. He also claimed it was “a little
  too politically correct”. Boyle recently returned to the zombie franchise he
  helped to create with 28 Years Later, a box office success earlier this summer
  making $150m worldwide. The film featured O’Connell in the final scenes and he
  will be a more prominent feature in the sequel out next year. Boyle is
  attached to make the as-yet-confirmed third film dependent on the success of
  the second which will also see the return of Cillian Murphy. O’Connell also
  recently starred in Ryan Coogler’s smash hit horror Sinners and will also soon
  be seen in Godzilla x Kong: Supernova. Pearce received his first Oscar
  nomination this year for Brady Corbet’s The Brutalist and will soon be seen
  alongside Keira Knightley in mystery thriller The Woman in Cabin 10 and Ridley
  Scott’s The Dog Stars.
