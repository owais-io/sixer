  peace’ as Dnipropetrovsk attacked

  Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region came under a “massive attack” early on
  Saturday, the region’s governor said, reporting strikes in Dnipro and
  Pavlograd. “The region is under a massive attack. Explosions are being heard,”
  Sergiy Lysak wrote on Telegram, warning residents to take cover. He said
  overnight Russian strikes killed two people in Dnipropetrovsk, which had been
  largely spared from intense fighting since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Kyiv
  acknowledged on Tuesday that Russian troops had entered the region. The United
  States has warned Russia to move toward peace and meet with Ukraine or face
  possible sanctions at an emergency meeting of the UN security council called
  on Friday after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 23 people overnight on
  Thursday. US diplomat John Kelley told the meeting the strikes “cast doubt on
  the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace” and demanded that “these strikes
  on civilian areas must stop immediately”. He said Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy must agree to meet, and reiterated Donald Trump’s warning that
  Washington could impose sanctions on Russia if the war continues. The French
  president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned that Trump risked being “played” by
  Putin if a Russia-Ukraine peace summit did not go ahead. Macron expressed hope
  that the two-way meeting would take place but warned if Russia did not meet a
  Monday deadline to agree to the talks, “it will show again President Putin has
  played President Trump”. The White House responded that Trump is still working
  on a Russia-Ukraine peace summit. “President Trump and his national security
  team continue to engage with Russian and Ukrainian officials towards a
  bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war,” a White House official
  told AFP. “As many world leaders have stated, this war would have never
  happened if President Trump was in office. It is not in the national interest
  to further negotiate these issues publicly.” Trump’s deputy chief of staff
  Stephen Miller dismissed the suggestion that the US president had been fooled
  by Putin. “Such an absurd question,” he said when asked about Macron’s
  comments. “No president in history has done more to advance the cause of
  peace. He’s working steadfastly to end the killing, and that’s something that
  everybody in the world should celebrate.” Zelenskyy said he expected to
  continue talks with European leaders next week on “Nato-like” commitments to
  protect Ukraine, adding that Trump should also be involved. “We need the
  architecture to be clear to everyone,” he said, adding that he wanted to tell
  Trump “how we see it”. EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen on Friday
  expressed “broad support” for expanding the bloc’s military training mission
  to operate inside Ukraine, the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said. “The EU
  has already trained over 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers,” Kallas wrote on X. “We
  must be ready to do more.” Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, met with
  Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in New York on Friday, discussing the
  need to increase pressure on Moscow. After the meeting, Yermak said on social
  media that the mass Russian attack on Kyiv on Thursday showed that Moscow “is
  not even showing any willingness to end the war”. “We also talked about
  working with American and European partners on security guarantees. This is
  very important. Without them, it is impossible to look forward,” he said.
  Russia is building up a force of about 100,000 troops near the eastern
  Ukrainian stronghold of Pokrovsk, which Russia claims as its territory,
  Zelenskyy said on Friday. “There is a buildup and concentration of the enemy
  there. Up to 100,000 – that’s what we have as of this morning. They are
  preparing offensive actions in any case,” the president told journalists. He
  added that Ukrainian forces were pushing out pockets of Russian troops from
  the north-eastern border region of Sumy. North Korean soldiers who died
  fighting for Russia in Ukraine have been called “martyrs” by the country’s
  leader, Kim Jong-un. Kim on Friday hosted the families of soldiers, saying
  they sacrificed their lives to defend the country’s honour, the KCNA state
  news agency reported. According to South Korea’s intelligence agency, about
  600 North Korean troops have been killed from a total deployment of 15,000.
