  Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized
  control of the city’s police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways that
  are sharply at odds with official crime statistics. The US president’s move
  was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on
  the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is
  expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the
  Guardian. Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump said he
  was taking “a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime,
  bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and
  we’re going to take our capital back.” He described Washington DC as “one of
  the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, claiming its murder rate is
  higher than Bogotá or Mexico City, even though violent crime is at a 30-year
  low. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was among officials joining
  Trump on the podium, said 800 national guard troops would take to the streets
  of Washington over the coming week. “They will be strong, they will be tough
  and they will stand with their law enforcement partners,” he said. Trump, who
  lost the presidential election in DC to Democrat Kamala Harris by 86
  percentage points, added that he may send in the military “if needed”. By
  invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the president
  is federalising DC’s Metropolitan police department for the first time in its
  history. He said he was declaring a public safety emergency and putting the
  police under the control of the attorney general, Pam Bondi. Trump vowed to
  allow police to “do whatever the hell they want” in the face of provocations.
  “That’s the only language they [alleged criminals] understand. They like to
  spit in the face of the police. You spit, and we hit, and they get hit real
  hard.” Section 740 requires the mayor, Muriel Bowser, to provide “such
  services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary
  and appropriate”, when the president determines that there are “special
  conditions” requiring it. The president can only exercise such control under
  the act for 30 days without Congress passing a law extending it. After the
  former General Services Administration staffer Edward Coristine – a
  19-year-old on the so-called “department of government efficiency” team
  nicknamed “Big Balls” – appeared to have been attacked by a group of young
  people last week near his car, Trump began discussing a return to federal
  control of the city and the use of national guard to quell street crime.
  Washington DC was hit hard by the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, recording
  more homicides in 2023 than in any year since 1997. At that time it was among
  the top five homicide rates in major population centres – those with more than
  a million residents – behind only Memphis in Tennessee, St Louis in Missouri
  and Baltimore in Maryland, according to the non-profit USAFacts. But violent
  crime in Washington DC has fallen sharply since 2023, shaking off the pandemic
  increases to reach a 30-year low on the day Trump took office, and has fallen
  26% further this year according to weekly reports from the Metropolitan police
  department. The change in crime rates is consistent with dramatic decreases in
  violence in large cities across the country. The capital is much safer than it
  used to be. In 1991 it was branded the murder capital of the US with the
  killing of 482 people. By last year the total number of homicides had fallen
  to 187. This year the rate is on course to be lower. Nonetheless, Trump
  ordered a range of federal law enforcement agencies to deploy on to DC streets
  over the weekend in a surge. About 450 officers from the United States Capitol
  police, the Federal Protective Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
  Firearms and Explosives and other agencies were present into the city’s
  quadrants over the weekend. At the press conference on Monday morning, Trump
  painted a nightmarish portrait of a city “overtaken by violent gangs and
  bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and
  homeless people”. The US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro,
  a former Fox News host only confirmed to her role on 2 August, said she saw
  “too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can
  get together in gangs and crews and beat the hell out of you or anyone else”.
  Pirro expressed her frustration with what she views as excessive leniency when
  it comes to the way juveniles are prosecuted. “I can’t arrest them. I can’t
  prosecute them,” she said. “They go to family court, and they get to do yoga
  and arts and crafts. Enough, it changes today.” Pirro called for changes to
  the law to allow a wider range of juvenile cases to be heard in adult court.
  Again taking to social media on Sunday, Trump demanded that unhoused residents
  of the capital leave, posting images of encampments ostensibly taken from his
  motorcade. “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote on his
  Truth Social platform on Sunday morning, shortly after being driven from the
  White House to his golf club in Virginia. “We will give you places to stay,
  but FAR from the Capital.” Homelessness rates in the nation’s capital have
  also been falling, with the most recent point-in-time count showing a decrease
  from 2024. Monday’s announcement by Trump, who pardoned his supporters who
  attacked the US Capitol in Washington on 6 January 2021, was criticised by
  Democrats and civil rights leaders. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting
  delegate representing DC in the House of Representatives, said the decision
  “is an historic assault on DC home rule, is a counterproductive, escalatory
  seizure of DC’s resources to use for purposes not supported by DC residents,
  and is more evidence of the urgent need to pass my DC statehood bill”. Ken
  Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Trump is once
  again playing political games using service members and federal law
  enforcement officials. Trump doesn’t give a damn about keeping DC residents
  safe. “When rioters violently stormed the Capitol and there were repeated
  requests for the national guard, Trump failed to act. To add insult to injury,
  he released from jail those 1,500 violent insurrectionists who assaulted
  police officers and broke local and federal law.” Al Sharpton, the founder and
  president of the National Action Network, suggested that the intervention was
  motivated by a desire to distract from criticisms over the administration’s
  handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. “Donald Trump was inspired to take this
  disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” he
  said. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city
  for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his
  administration’s handling of the Epstein files.” Later Muriel Bowser, the
  mayor of DC, who has pursued a non-confrontational relationship with Trump,
  described the intervention as “unsettling and unprecedented” but declined to
  criticise the president directly. “I’ve said before, and I’ll repeat, that I
  believe that the president’s view of DC is shaped by his Covid-era experience
  during his first term,” she told reporters. “It is true that those were more
  challenging times related to some issues. It is also true that we experienced
  a crime spike post-Covid but we worked quickly to put laws in place and
  tactics that got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police
  officers more tools.” Bowser said her office plans to follow the law and
  cooperate with the federal government, though “I don’t want to minimise the
  intrusion on our autonomy”. She has requested a meeting with Bondi, who will
  temporarily oversee the Metropolitan police department. Flanked by Pamela
  Smith, the DC police chief, and other city officials, Bowser added: “While
  this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can’t say that, given
  some of the rhetoric of the past, we’re totally surprised. I can say to DC
  residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes
  you proud.” Asked about Trump’s hint that he could deploy the US military if
  required, the mayor replied: “I think I speak for all Americans. We don‘t
  believe it is legal to use the American military against American citizens on
  American soil. I am not a lawyer, but I think that is a fairly widely held
  fact.” Meanwhile Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House,
  described Trump as a “wannabe king” and argued his plan to “unleash the
  national guard on the city’s youth and homeless population has no basis in law
  and will put the safety of the people of our nation’s capital in danger”. He
  added: “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject
  this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.” Shrai Popat contributed
