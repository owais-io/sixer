  Name: Otrovert. Age: The term is brand new. From “otro” meaning … ? Other. And
  “vert” meaning green, as it does in French? Are we talking about aliens? No,
  “vert” meaning to turn. As in divert, convert, invert … And introvert? Yes!
  See also extrovert, terms Carl Jung came up with to describe personality
  traits. So if introverts look inwards, and extroverts outwards, where the hell
  do otroverts look? Neither of the above. “Their fundamental orientation is
  defined by the fact that it is rarely the same direction that anyone else is
  facing.” Says who? Rami Kaminski, the pioneering American psychiatrist, came
  up with the term and has recognised the personality type in some of his
  patients, and in himself. When and how did he see it in himself? As a child,
  when he joined the Scouts. He put on the uniform, sat in a circle and repeated
  the pledge, but while other kids seemed awed by the initiation, “I felt
  nothing,” he writes in New Scientist. So it’s about not fitting in. Exactly.
  And is that bad? He says that some have seen it as a psychological problem to
  be treated, and admits there can be social consequences in a culture that is
  geared towards belonging, especially for teenagers. Otroverts tend to be
  immune to what he calls “the bluetooth phenomenon”. Have they checked their
  settings? Maybe it’s just switched off. He means the ability others have to
  emotionally pair with others in the vicinity. Oh. Anyway, I’m sensing it’s not
  all negative and there’s a big “but” coming … But he thinks everyone is born
  an otrovert. And for those who resist the cultural conditioning that cements
  our affiliations with various groups and identities, there can be advantages.
  Such as? Originality and emotional independence. You can think for yourself
  and have original ideas. He’s written a book about it, The Gift of Not
  Belonging: How Outsiders Thrive in a World of Joiners. Self-help for maverick
  carpenters? No. But note it’s the gift, not the burden of not belonging. Who
  are some examples of otroverts from history? He mentions Frida Kahlo, Franz
  Kafka, Albert Einstein … An impressive list for Team Otrovert. No! Not a team,
  a bunch of individuals. Kaminski says George Orwell was another. “History is
  full of independent thinkers who aren’t emotionally dependent on any group and
  can therefore see the fanaticism of a hive mind long before most people can.”
  Got it. Not found in hives, herds, flocks etc. Dolly the Sheep? Not an
  otrovert. There you go, though Shaun might be an exception as he’s a true
  renegade. Do say: “Every day is Independence Day.” Don’t say: “So it is like a
  club, but for people who don’t like clubs.”
