  ​movie​?

  Walking out of a 6.30pm showing of The Naked Gun a couple of weeks ago I was
  greeted by an unfamiliar sight: daylight. Had I gone to see the film in the
  upper reaches of the northern hemisphere, where daylight is near-permanent in
  the summer months? No I was in Leicester Square – a different kind of barren
  wasteland than the Arctic tundra – and there was another reason for the
  brightness: The Naked Gun was only 1hr 25m long. Very few modern films – aside
  from those of the child-friendly variety – clock in at less than 90 minutes,
  but even so The Naked Gun doesn’t feel a total outlier. In fact, of the last
  three blockbusters I’ve seen at the cinema, only one – Superman – went beyond
  the two hour mark, and only by 10 minutes. The other, The Fantastic Four:
  First Steps, was 1hr 54m, relatively svelte for a 21st-century superhero
  movie. Granted, earlier in this summer we had Mission: Impossible - The Final
  Reckoning, clocking in at a Brobdingnagian 2hr 49m (and boy, at times did it
  feel it), but looking back now, that almost feels a relic from and earlier,
  more indulgent time. Because, generally the blockbuster seems to be getting
  shorter. The average for this year’s top 10 movies so far at the US box office
  (which seems to me the best benchmark for the health of the blockbuster given
  they make and consume the bulk of them), is 2hr 4m. That number (sure to be
  nudged up further by Avatar: Fire and Ash later this year) is actually higher
  than last year’s average between the top 10 – 2h 01m – but way down on the 2hr
  15m and 2hr 16m of 2023 and 2022 respectively. Those years admittedly featured
  some hefty movies like Oppenheimer (3hrs) bumping up their averages, but also
  some silly lengths for movies of a more disposable nature: how, for example
  did John Wick 4, a dialogue-light film about a man hurting other men in
  various imaginative ways, clock in at a whopping 2hr and 49m? Or why did The
  Batman brush right up to the three-hour mark? And did the live-action Little
  Mermaid really need to be two and a quarter hours? The animated original
  managed to rattle through the story in almost an hour less. Listen, we
  probably talk too much about films being too long these days: it’s something I
  have definitely been guilty of in this newsletter, somewhat absurdly because I
  don’t actually have a problem with long films at all – especially when a
  bladder-aiding intermission is included as part of the deal. I’m generally of
  the belief that films should be as long as they need to be and, in some cases,
  a film needs to be very long indeed. But it’s certainly the case that
  blockbusters, once designed to provide quick, easy thrills, have tended toward
  bloat since the 2010s. Much of that of course has to do with the steroidal
  growth of the superhero movie, which, in service of the “expanded universe
  model” of interlocking films, had to incorporate more and more convoluted
  backstories and peripheral characters into its run times. That feature soon
  became a bug, with endless complaints in thinkpieces and on forums that
  superhero films had grown too long. But there has been a sense in recent years
  that the superhero industrial complex has listened to the ambient noise around
  its films being too long. You could see those stirrings in the desire by Nia
  DaCosta, director of 2023’s The Marvels, to make that film under two hours.
  She succeeded and then some: it’s the shortest Marvel movie of all, at 1hr
  45m. (Though given The Marvels is regarded as one of the weakest Marvel
  movies, such brevity doesn’t always equal quality.) Equally Superman director
  James Gunn had to deny rumours Warner Bros had ordered him to make the film
  shorter: he perhaps should have listened given the movie’s weakest moment is
  an impossible to follow city-smashing final battle that goes on for at least
  five minutes more than it needs to. Certainly there’s a sense watching The
  Fantastic Four that it strives to stay under the two-hour mark. In doing so it
  perhaps over-corrects a little: a blossoming romance between Ebon
  Moss-Bachrach’s The Thing and Natasha Lyonne’s schoolteacher suddenly vanishes
  midway through the movie – or more likely was sent to the cutting room floor
  by clockwatchers. Still, that did probably contribute to a film that, while
  not without flaws, felt appealingly brisk. Hopefully more mainstream movies
  can follow its example, as well as that of The Naked Gun, whose 1hr 25m
  runtime is identical to that of the original movie in the franchise in 1988.
  Back then that was a little less of an outlier: the average run time of the
  top 10 highest grossers that year – a time Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Coming To
  America, Die Hard and the like reigned supreme – was a positively breezy 1hr
  48m … so there’s still a long way to go in films getting shorter. If you want
