  Glaciers on a remote Australian subantarctic island are shrinking rapidly,
  losing almost a quarter of their size in just 70 years, with researchers
  fearing glaciers on a neighbouring peninsula may have already disappeared.
  Analysis of aerial photographs and maps going back to 1947 were combined with
  satellite data to track melting on 29 glaciers on the uninhabited wilderness
  of Heard Island, 4,100km south-west of Perth and 1,500km north of Antarctica.
  Scientists said global heating was the most likely cause of the dramatic ice
  losses. Between 1947 and 2019, the island had warmed by 0.7C, while the area
  covered by glacial ice fell from 289 sq km to 225 sq km. The most dramatic
  changes were recorded on the island’s east, in particular on Stephenson
  glacier, which has retreated almost 6km since 1947. In the last 20 years, the
  glacier retreated on average 178 metres a year, the research, published last
  week in the scientific journal the Cryosphere, found. “Glaciers are extremely
  sensitive to small changes in temperature,” said Prof Andrew Mackintosh, one
  of the paper’s authors and chief investigator at Monash University’s Securing
  Antarctica’s Environmental Future (SAEF). As the air warms, the melt rate
  increases and more snow falls as rain, Mackintosh said. “I’ve got no doubt the
  increase in temperature is primarily responsible for driving the glacier
  retreat. This shows that no place is free from the influence of climate
  change.” On the neighbouring Laurens peninsula, where there are 11 small
  glaciers, the losses were even more dramatic. The 10.5 sq km of glacier ice
  that was there in 1947 was at just 2.2 sq km in 2019, the final year of data
  for the research. “One or two of those glaciers may have already disappeared
  now,” said Dr Levan Tielidze, the paper’s lead author and research fellow at
  SAEF. “They are small glaciers, but it’s a sign of what will happen in the
  future to the larger glaciers on Heard. These findings are a bellwether of
  change for our global climate system.” • Sign up to get climate and
  environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter SAEF is
  now using climate models to understand what could happen to the island’s
  glaciers in the future under different levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
  Mackintosh said: “Although this mapping shows stark glacier retreat and
  further ice loss is unavoidable, whether we retain glaciers or lose most of
  them entirely is up to humans and the greenhouse gas emission pathway we
  follow. “It might also mean the difference between a future where biodiversity
  is devastated, or one where key parts are secured.” Pristine but vulnerable
  Heard Island made headlines earlier this year when Donald Trump listed it as
  being subject to a 10% trade tariff, despite nobody actually living there. The
  pristine world heritage-listed island includes Australia’s only active
  volcano, Big Ben, and is a magnet for seabirds such as penguins, petrels and
  albatross, as well as elephant seals and unique slow-growing cushion plants.
  Dr Justine Shaw, an associate professor at SAEF with the Queensland University
  of Technology, visited the island in 2003. “It is an absolutely mind-blowing
  place – a glaciated island,” she said. “You’re on a beach surrounded by
  elephant seals with king penguins all around and then swooping down from the
  mountain are sooty albatross calling at each other. “There’s this incredible
  wildlife and you have your feet in black volcanic sand. And it’s right at the
  southern limit of where plants can grow.” The island has only one weed and no
  other invasive species, she said, which made it a perfect place to study the
  impact of climate change on the island’s biodiversity. Shaw said the glacial
  retreat could be generating risks for the unique plant life – a combination of
  cushion plants, a cabbage, and the insects that live on them. More bare ground
  exposed by the retreating glaciers created a chance invasive plants could take
  hold, she said. The appearance of a growing lagoon at the bottom of Stephenson
  glacier could also be destabilising the ground used by birds for nesting. “The
  lagoon that’s growing there is opened up to the sea. That will cause erosion,”
  she said. The government’s Australian Antarctic Program this week announced
  two scientific visits to the island later this year – the first expeditions in
  more than 20 years. Shaw is organising a team of scientists to travel on the
  expedition to study the island’s unique combination of insects and plants that
  she said existed nowhere else on Earth. While she was not surprised the
  glaciers were retreating, she added: “What’s amazing is the rate of the
  melting – it is so rapid.”
