  When thousands of ambulance workers went on strike on 21 December 2022 to
  demand better pay and conditions, the then shadow health secretary, Wes
  Streeting, wasn’t shy in pointing out who was responsible. In their refusal to
  negotiate, he tweeted, Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay had driven NHS staff to
  strike, leaving patients “in no doubt who is to blame for this chaos”. Three
  years and one general election later, the surgical slipper is firmly on the
  other foot. Resident doctors – formerly known as junior doctors – have just
  finished a five-day strike, demanding a 29% pay rise over the next few years.
  Among placards on picket lines calling for “pay restoration” and an end to
  “cuts so deep that even a surgeon couldn’t fix it” were printed copies of
  Streeting’s tweet. Gone is the relaxed attitude displayed by the health
  secretary towards the British Medical Association (BMA) in 2024, when he
  agreed a deal with doctors that set them on a “journey to pay restoration”. He
  has called this latest strike a “gift to Nigel Farage” and urged resident
  doctors to cross picket lines and join their colleagues still “turning up to
  work”. He has described the strike not only as “reckless”, but as an action
  that “enormously undermines the entire trade union movement”. Union general
  secretaries have been quick to shoot back, with Dave Ward of the Communication
  Workers Union calling Streeting’s comments “shameful”, and the Public and
  Commercial Services Union’s Fran Heathcote accusing the health secretary of
  “carping in the Murdoch press” instead of negotiating a settlement. For a
  government whose relationship with organised labour has so far been largely
  harmonious – apart from Unite’s suspension of Angela Rayner over the
  Birmingham bin strikes – Streeting’s denouncement of the BMA is the closest
  Labour has come to picking a fight with the unions. Is this the government’s
  industrial shot across the bows? While on the face of it, the row might seem
  like the first real sign of confrontation between Labour and the unions, it’s
  worth taking a closer look at what is happening. Underlying Streeting’s
  intervention are a number of factors that make the BMA an easy target for a
  government that’s keen to display that it can be tough on unions and not in
  the pocket of its “union paymasters”. The BMA is not affiliated to Labour, nor
  is it part of the Trades Union Congress, making Labour’s institutional link to
  it much weaker. There’s also the fact that resistance to the strike isn’t
  coming only from the government’s side: other healthcare unions have expressed
  unease over existing discrepancies in NHS pay offers. Last month, the Royal
  College of Nursing called the government’s decision to award resident doctors
  a 5.4% pay increase while offering nursing staff 3.6% “grotesque”. In a video
  posted on X about the strike, Streeting plays into those divisions within the
  movement, stoking tension between resident doctors and other NHS workers. He
  talks about “working hard with … staff that aren’t paid as much as doctors to
  make sure that your pay and your career progression and the conditions that
  you work in are also good for you”. Add to that the older consultants and
  medical professionals who have been having their say: that a strike would
  “further diminish the ability of the NHS to deliver”, that “it is too soon to
  go again”, or simply that resident doctors are being “very greedy”. Then
  there’s the drastic lurch by the Tories – both in government and opposition –
  to the right on industrial matters, with Kemi Badenoch proposing this week to
  ban doctors from taking strike action, putting them under the same rules that
  apply to police, prison officers and soldiers. This approach gives Streeting
  more room to present himself as tough but reasonable. This isn’t to defend
  Streeting, who is probably more than happy to use strike action to justify
  further NHS privatisation. Nor is it to undermine how galling his comments are
  for those standing out on the picket lines. One doctor has called them a “slap
  in the face”, while another asked where the Streeting of 2022 had gone: “He
  was making some good points.” But government condemnation of the strike does
  not necessarily reflect a wider shift in its strategy towards unions. Amid
  frenzied attacks by Tories and their media allies on Labour’s link with the
  unions, the reality of the relationship is all too often drowned out. That
  makes it harder to understand key dynamics: it’s likely to be transport unions
  that the government hopes to take on, not only industrially but politically.
  It also makes it harder to spot how unions’ different industrial priorities
  inform their relationship with the government. With so much of Labour’s
  employment rights bill left to secondary legislation, general secretaries
  still have eyes on the prize of getting their sectoral needs met, whether
  that’s Unison pushing for fair pay agreements or the Union of Shop,
  Distributive and Allied Workers for zero-hours contract reform. Then there’s
  the fact that there are those in Labour who are itching to embrace the spirit
  of the 1980s and launch a full-frontal attack on the movement. The country is
  once again facing the prospect of widespread public sector industrial action,
  with nurses and teachers potentially set to join the strike action. A decade
  of suppressed public sector pay, inflation and increases in the cost of living
  has challenged the idea that certain professions’ wages are always guarantees
  of a good life. On a basic starting salary of £38,831 and saddled with as much
  as £100,000 of student debt, it’s no longer enough for new resident doctor
  recruits to simply wait to earn more at some distant point in the future.
  While there are grievances specific to the resident doctors’ strikes – a
  shortage of speciality training posts and having to spend thousands of pounds
  on exam fees, courses and equipment such as stethoscopes – many of their
  concerns are felt deeply across the movement. Stubborn mountains of student
  debt, housing costs that utterly eclipse wages and crumbling public services
  that drive down working conditions are not unique to the BMA. For this
  dispute, Labour has used inter-union tensions over NHS pay – as well as the
  outdated idea that all resident doctors are middle-class professionals – as a
  political opportunity to dodge blame for the strike. But that strategy won’t
  work for all strikes. As public sector unrest continues to unfold, the
  government’s battle with the unions might well begin in earnest. Polly Smythe
