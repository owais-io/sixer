  Schools in parts of Texas reopened their doors two months earlier than planned
  this summer. But the reason was tragic. They were transformed into “relief
  hubs” to welcome volunteers whose efforts were instrumental in responding to
  devastating floods in the state. Now, as lessons have mostly resumed in Texas,
  the classrooms have been turned back from temporary emergency centres into
  places of learning, but that’s not to say the memories of what was lost will
  linger with the community indefinitely. “In the days ahead, we will continue
  to stand united, working hand in hand to support our neighbors and help our
  community heal in the aftermath of this event,” said Sarah Nichols, the
  principal of Hunt school in central Kerr county, Texas. “Our school stood as a
  beacon of hope, service, and resilience.” Hunt school, which serves both
  elementary and middle school students, joined several others in affected areas
  of Texas in becoming a hub for relief and recovery in the earliest days of the
  flash floods. The floods, which started over Fourth of July weekend, killed at
  least 135 people, including many children. Authorities are still continuing to
  search for more than 100 missing people. By the third day of the flooding, the
  Hunt campus was recast as a functioning shelter, offering food, showers and
  safe housing for more than 150 people at a time. It also became an operations
  center for several organizations such as Reach Global, Team Rubicon and Aerial
  Recovery. Volunteers worked to stock and distribute search and recovery
  supplies and provide fuel for first responders. “The community was
  outstanding. If people were not affected by the flooding, they were doing
  everything they could to help those who were,” said Thomas McAvoy, one of the
  volunteers with Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization, who
  stayed at Hunt school for the duration of the recovery efforts. “To the kids
  returning to school, I would firstly say thank you,” McAvoy added. “We were
  allowed into your space, and the few interactions we had with you, you guys
  were amazing. I know this was a life-changing event, but as a survivor, it
  will have made you stronger, and I know you will do great things to help this
  never happen again.” With staff returning to the Hunt campus on 11 August and
  students on 20 August , the turnaround mission to get the buildings back to
  their original purpose was momentous. The school was still functioning as a
  shelter through the end of July, with classrooms acting as sleeping quarters
  with cots in places of desks and boardrooms as supply rooms for donated goods.
  “These were not normal functions for a school preparing for a new semester,
  but the times called for extraordinary measures,” said Oscar Arauco, another
  Rubicon volunteer who was stationed at the school. “Volunteers swept,
  vacuumed, moved supplies, and helped restore classrooms and facilities so Hunt
  school could quickly resume its primary mission: educating children.” In times
  of natural disaster, it is not uncommon for schools to act as relief stations,
  given their range of amenities like cafeterias, gymnasiums, and shower and
  locker rooms. This was the case back in 2017, when Hurricane Harvey ripped
  through the Caribbean and the US states of Texas and Louisiana, causing at
  least $90bn of damage to property and livelihoods, and killing scores of
  people. The storm made landfall 200 miles (322km) from Houston in August 2017
  and stalled for four days, dropping as much as 60in (152cm) of rain over parts
  of the metropolitan area. Schools in Houston subsequently shifted their
  missions, acting as shelters for displaced students and their families Other
  schools in Austin, Dallas and El Paso quickly followed suit, offering a haven
  for those facing long-term displacement. The term date for students returning
  to schools in these areas even had to get pushed back to as late as 5
  September. Hunt school was not alone during this disaster in its mission of
  turning its space into a thriving volunteer centre. The Ingram Tom Moore high
  school, which serves older children through grades 9-12 in Ingram, Texas, also
  acted similarly. In the days following the floods, the school became a hub,
  where anyone distributing supplies to those affected would come to collect
  their goods. “We have been overwhelmed with the generosity of our community
  and blessed to operate in this capacity,” a representative of the school wrote
  in a Facebook post. “Ingram ISD continues to keep our community and everyone
  impacted by this tragedy in our prayers.” Perhaps the biggest task for Hunt
  school and others across Texas, though, was not the gruelling volunteer work
  itself, or even the labour of restoring these institutions back to places of
  education. One significant obstacle educators now face across the country is
  how to deal with the children in their schools who have experienced this
  tragedy. How to navigate loss and grief with such a young age group. “One of
  the greatest challenges will be balancing the need to continue growing our
  students academically while also addressing their social and emotional needs,”
  said Nichols, the principal. “Together, we will ensure our students and their
  families have the support, resources, and care they need – both at school and
  at home – to feel safe, valued, and ready to learn. Our approach will be
  rooted in compassion, understanding, and flexibility, knowing that healing is
  just as important as academic growth in this season.” According to CNN, among
  the 135 flood victims were two of Hunt’s youngest students. In nearby
  Kerrville, a teacher and coach, along with his whole family, were also killed.
  In other areas, the youth death tolls were higher. Camp Mystic, the girls’
  summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River in Texas, confirmed that 27
  children and counsellors passed away in the floods. Another volunteer at Hunt
  school, Jennifer Nieder, said what she would say to kids starting the academic
  year is that “you have an incredible community and we were lucky to be able to
  come in and spend some time with you.” When asked about the challenges they
  may face having lost their loved ones, Nieder said: “It’s OK to not be OK.”
  She added: “Talk to your friends. Talk to your parents. Talk to your
  teachers.”
