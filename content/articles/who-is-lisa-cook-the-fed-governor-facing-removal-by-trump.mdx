  Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve’s board of
  governors, is now facing removal by Donald Trump, another obstacle in a long
  line she has faced and written about during her experiences as one of a small
  number of Black women in the field of economics. Cook was nominated to the Fed
  in 2022 by then president Joe Biden after building a career that spanned both
  government and academia, including work at the treasury department, service in
  the White House, and a long record of scholarly contributions. But her path to
  confirmation wasn’t without hostility. Republicans opposed her nomination,
  forcing Vice-President Kamala Harris to break a 50–50 Senate deadlock. That
  narrow vote made Cook the first, and so far the only, Black woman to serve as
  a Fed governor. Her potential dismissal comes just days after federal housing
  finance agency director Bill Pulte alleged on social media that she falsified
  records and other documents to obtain favorable mortgage terms prior to her
  appointment. Cook has not been charged with a crime or found guilty of
  misconduct. By law, governors on the Fed’s board are appointed to 14-year
  terms and can only be removed for “cause”, generally understood to mean
  corruption or serious wrongdoing. Cook has continued to push back. Last week,
  she declared she had “no intention of being bullied” and promised to gather
  “accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the
  facts”. In a statement on Tuesday, she insisted that “no cause exists under
  the law, and he [Trump] has no authority” to strip her of the seat she has
  held since 2022. Her attorney has said they intend to sue. Since joining the
  board, Cook has consistently voted in line with chair Jerome Powell,
  supporting last year’s decision to cut interest rates and this year’s decision
  to hold them steady. She is sometimes described as a “dove”, a label
  economists use for officials who lean toward lower rates. Cook was born in
  Georgia, where she was raised by a hospital chaplain and a nursing professor.
  She and her sisters were among the first Black students to integrate their
  schools. She went on to study at Spelman College, then Oxford University as a
  Marshall scholar, before earning her PhD in economics from the University of
  California, Berkeley, in 1997. Her academic work often linked economics with
  the realities of race and discrimination. One of her most recognized works,
  Violence and economic activity: evidence from African American patents,
  described how lynchings and other acts of racial violence in the late 1800s
  and early 1900s drastically reduced patent activity among Black inventors.
  Cook has also written candidly about the challenges she has faced in her
  profession. In a 2019 opinion piece in the New York Times, she and a co-author
  argued that “economics is neither a welcoming nor a supportive profession for
  women”. She added: “But if economics is hostile to women, it is especially
  antagonistic to Black women.”
