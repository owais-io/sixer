  A Chinese economist once asked me to explain British universities. “Why do you
  take your young,” he said, “at their most creative age, lock them in a
  monastery for three years and make them drunk?” Each August I recall this
  question when hundreds of thousands of British teenagers scramble to enter
  university. They must perform utterly archaic feats of memory in their exams
  and then embark on an academic experience that has almost nothing to do with
  real life. Their reward may be a higher income, but perhaps not higher than
  their innate ability would have gained them anyway. England’s present
  university system is in a terrible mess, chronically in need of a royal
  commission. Between 1997 and 2010, university student numbers increased by
  68%. Then, under the coalition government, universities were offered £9,000 a
  year for each of an unlimited number of students. It was an open invitation to
  lower standards and increase overcrowding. Some cities found themselves with
  two if not three universities, with multiple campuses, student residences and
  overheads to match. The waste was ludicrous. Their vice-chancellors received
  crazy sums. The average for the Russell group is now £400,000. The government
  supposedly recouped the cost of all this by treating fees and maintenance
  grants as borrowed. This allowed university extravagance to appear not as
  public spending but as debt, on the thesis that the students would repay it
  with interest one day. Until recently no more than a quarter of graduates were
  expected to fully repay their loans – small wonder, as they averaged £50,000 a
  head. The accumulated student debt is enormous. It has reached more than
  £250bn and is said to be heading for £500bn by the late 2040s. Quite why
  higher education should be so privileged as not to count as current spending
  has never been clear. As with HS2, the Treasury likes to treat certain sorts
  of posh spending as “investment” rather than hard cash. The reliance on fees
  from overseas students – now covering nearly a quarter of university income –
  caused the present crisis. As this income has fallen, in part through recent
  immigration and visa changes, 40% of England’s universities are set to be in
  financial deficit. Jobs and courses are being cut back. Meanwhile, every bit
  of news out of the university sector seems grim. Employers are disregarding
  not just classes of degree, but degrees at all. It is 10 years since the large
  accountancy firm EY started disregarding A-levels and degree classes in
  recruitment, while PwC said it would rely on aptitude and behaviour tests. I
  know of no job that ever depends on a class of degree. The Office for National
  Statistics records that more than a quarter of graduates in England are now in
  medium- or low-skilled jobs. Another survey shows the graduate “premium” is
  plummeting. This is not just a British issue. Across the US and the EU,
  graduate unemployment is almost on a par with non-graduate. Students seem
  miserable. The two-thirds who leave home to go to college report soaring
  mental illness, with 90% suffering from loneliness. The Boston Consulting
  Group last year found ex-students the fastest group of young people going
  straight into long-term sickness. The solution is glaring: cut back. The
  thesis that university courses require a minimum of three years, each with
  barely six months of teaching, is absurd. For most courses, two years should
  be enough, as the former universities minister, Jo Johnson, has proposed. The
  number of institutions claiming fully-fledged university status should be
  slashed. The practice of almost every city hosting two universities – or 40 in
  London – should end in a mass of mergers. There should be a return to
  vocational colleges, with an emphasis on contact with local employment. This
  was proposed by James Dyson in setting up just such a college in Wiltshire,
  the Dyson Institute, in 2017. Another, the New Model Institute for Technology
  and Engineering in Herefordshire, was started by the Tory MP Jesse Norman. It
  is simply absurd that a large number of graduates should be doing work
  supposedly not requiring a degree, and yet the welfare state is chronically
  short of trained medical and care staff. This is a serious failure of
  education planning. Higher education should be free at the point of use; not,
  as it is in England now, free only to those whose parents can pay their fees
  upfront. But those completing a university course should repay the privilege
  with a modestly higher rate of tax throughout their working life. Loans should
  cover only maintenance. Of course university is not just a preparation for
  work, even if for 18-year-olds that is the primary issue at hand. A university
  is more than a start in life. It is also an experience of liberal education
  that goes far beyond the young who are its current beneficiaries. A true
  university should promote breadth of thought and freedom of speech to old as
  well as young. It should not turn in on itself as its resources shrink. It
  should make its courses and work accessible to people beyond its walls and
  across the community. Universities are costing us dear. We should not feel
  they are wasted on the young. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist
