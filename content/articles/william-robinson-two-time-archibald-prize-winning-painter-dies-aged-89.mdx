  William Robinson AO, acclaimed Australian landscape painter and two-time
  winner of the Archibald Prize, has died aged 89. The Brisbane-born artist, who
  won his first Archibald prize in 1987 with a self-mocking portrait of himself
  on a horse, died peacefully in Brisbane on Tuesday evening. “After a brief
  illness and care from the wonderful staff at the Wesley hospital, it is with
  heartfelt sorrow to tell you that our beloved father, Bill, passed away last
  night,” his children said in a statement. “He died peacefully surrounded by
  his family. He was much loved and we will miss him dearly.” Robinson was best
  known for his paintings of the lush rainforest of south-east Queensland,
  winning the Wynne prize for landscape painting twice. He also won acclaim for
  his humorous self-portraits, winning the Archibald a second time in 1995 for
  his painting Self-portrait with stunned mullet, showing him in full wet
  weather gear and holding two fish. Born in Brisbane in 1936, Robinson
  developed a love of painting and music as a child and considered becoming a
  concert pianist. He married at 22, and with a family to support, he instead
  embarked on a long career teaching art in Brisbane. In the 1970s he moved with
  wife Shirley and their six children to a rural property where they raised
  cows, goats and chooks, before retreating to the Gold Coast hinterland.
  Several of his paintings were selected for Australian Perspecta in 1983 and
  the Sixth Biennale of Sydney in 1986, before his Archibald success the next
  year with Equestrian self-portrait. Robinson was working as an art lecturer
  when he got the call telling him he had won the Archibald prize – and that he
  had to be in Sydney that afternoon. “I can’t, I’ve got to feed the goats,” he
  reportedly replied, spawning the headline: Goat farmer wins top art prize. By
  1989, Robinson retired from teaching and became a full-time artist. On
  Wednesday he was remembered as a modest man of faith, family and the
  Australian wilderness. “When you’re an artist, you’re a bit of a loner, you
  have a sort of isolated take on things,” Robinson once said of his career. “So
  it is not so much direct humour, it is rather a commentary on life and
  people.” Robinson was awarded honorary doctorates by three Queensland
  universities and in 2007 was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia
  for outstanding achievement and service to the arts. The William Robinson
  Gallery opened at Old Government House in Brisbane in 2009 at Queensland
  University of Technology’s Gardens Point campus. “It has been one of the
  highlights of my time ... to work with Bill, his late wife Shirley and their
  family in realising the vision of the gallery,” QUT vice-chancellor, Margaret
  Sheil, said. The Australian art world has lost a giant in the passing of
  Robinson, said Australian Galleries director Stuart Purves, who described him
  as “a man of outstanding care and human insight”. Robinson’s work is
  represented in major galleries across the nation and the world, including New
  York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art.
