  Figuring out the prison phone system was just one more thing Chris* had to do
  once he got locked up. “The [prison] officers don’t really help you at all,”
  he says. “They don’t tell you nothing … You usually just ask one of the
  sweepers or someone like, ‘How do I use it? What do I do here?’” But there’s a
  bigger problem than a lack of help and information, Chris says: the cost of
  phone calls made it very difficult to stay connected with his family. “It was
  real depressing,” he says. “Mum didn’t have much money at the time. And the
  money that I had, I had to space out to make sure that I could call her at
  least twice a week. “Even though I wanted to call her more than that, I didn’t
  have the funds.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Prison reform advocates argue
  the cost of calls in New South Wales correctional facilities is prohibitive
  and risks isolating men and women further, which can lead to more problems
  once they’re released. The NSW Greens MP Sue Higginson is urging the Minns
  government to make phone calls free for inmates to help their rehabilitation.
  Chris, who lives in Sydney’s south, says his mental health conditions made
  learning how to use the offender telephone system (OTS) stressful. In NSW,
  each inmate is entitled to one free 10-minute call a week – but to a landline
  only. In June 2023, three months after winning power, the NSW Labor government
  scrapped a service that provided low-cost calls for inmates to mobile phones.
  It dramatically increased the cost of a 10-minute call from 25c to $2.59. The
  number of people with landlines has dwindled. In 2024, only 17% of Australian
  adults had a landline phone that they used for personal purposes, according to
  the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The Sydney-based criminal
  psychologist Tim Watson-Munro describes prison phone calls as vital windows to
  the world for inmates. The calls are an essential support structure connecting
  prisoners to family and friends, “particularly maintaining the relationships
  in anticipation of eventually getting out of jail,” he says. “We found that
  the average survival rate of a relationship or marriage if someone was doing
  time was about two years.” Watson-Munro recalls working in the now-closed
  Parramatta jail. “People were typically doing 10 years on average, so there
  was an inevitability that their marriages would fail and their worlds fall
  apart, and so what are they going to go out to when they are eventually
  released from custody?” ‘Heartbreaking decisions’ A spokesperson for
  Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW) says there are a number of ways inmates can
  contact family, including in-person, free audiovisual link visits or phone
  calls via the OTS or tablets. For sentenced inmates, CSNSW covers the cost of
  one personal local call a week and all legal phone calls for those facing
  further charges. For inmates on remand, CSNSW pays for three personal local
  calls to landlines each week and all legal calls, the spokesperson says. “To
  make additional calls, inmates can use personal funds, including allowances
  gained through voluntary employment.” Inmates can also make calls using
  tablets, after a pilot initiative in 2020 designed to alleviate demand on
  telephones was installed in NSW prisons. Tablet calls have the same cost and
  restrictions as regular phone calls. There are now more than 12,000 tablets
  across the system. The tablets have “significantly reduced” queueing for
  wall-mounted phones, the spokesperson said. As a result, call times for
  inmates have been extended from a maximum of six minutes a call to 10 minutes.
  The introduction of the tablets also extended the time during which inmates
  can make calls in most prisons. Chris says the short calls were frustrating,
  especially as the six-minute limit when he served his sentence included an
  automated CSNSW message to alert the recipient it was a prison call, which cut
  into valuable speaking time with his mum. NSW inmates receive a basic weekly
  payment of around $16 according to advocates, which they can use to buy food
  and hygiene products, and access movies and news on the provided tablets. In
  September last year, Higginson tabled a petition in the state parliament,
  signed by 1,221 prisoners in NSW, requesting CSNSW provide all inmates with
  free calls to family. Higginson says it’s essential inmates stay connected to
  improve their wellbeing and rehabilitation. “It’s one of the simplest things
  in real terms the state can do when it has incarcerated somebody and deprived
  them of their liberty,” she says. Higginson says listening to the lived
  experience and suffering of inmates’ families and loved ones motivated her to
  try to reform access to phone calls. It is now up to the state corrections
  minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, and the commissioner of corrective services,
  Gary McCahon, to make this change, Higginson says. A spokesperson for
  Chanthivong says the minister understands the importance of ensuring inmates
  maintain support networks on the outside without compromising the safety and
  security of the prison system. “That’s why, following the minister’s
  instruction, CSNSW has successfully reduced call costs for inmates from the
  end of September 2025,” the spokesperson says. “From [then] on, an inmate’s
  first call to a mobile number each week will be free, and there will be a
  reduction in the cost of subsequent mobile calls. The cost of calls to
  Australian landlines will also be significantly reduced, providing assistance
  to the many inmates who make calls to landline numbers.” The CSNSW
  spokesperson says calls to any landline nationwide will cost the same as a
  local call, with a 10-minute call reduced from $1.80 to 25c. “This saving will
  be significant for inmates, as 30% of calls made by inmates are to landlines.”
  According to the latest government data, the adult prison population in NSW
  has risen to 13,103 inmates – the highest number since 2020. Dr Rory Gillard,
  from the Community Restorative Centre (CRC), says the advocacy group broadly
  supports free phone calls in NSW prisons. “Contact with family while in prison
  can reduce the risk of people reoffending,” Gillard says. “The cost of phone
  calls in prison can sometimes force people to make heartbreaking decisions
  between buying basic essentials they need in prison and maintaining regular
  connections with their loved ones.” The CRC is currently backing a petition
  called “Freedom on the line” that is urging parliament to make phone calls
  free and unlimited in NSW prisons. The petition was launched by Yung Prodigy,
  an organisation which focuses on young people affected by parental and kinship
  incarceration Chris says that when inmates first enter prison they see a nurse
  and welfare office and can then make one welfare call. “So I rang Mum when I
  got into custody and told her how to get a visitor identification number so
  she could put money into my account for me. And then it took me nearly 10 days
  to get all my numbers put on to the phone system before I was able to put $20
  on the phone so I could ring Mum,” he says. “The phone form sheet I had to put
  in wasn’t processed right away, and the time I had to wait to be able to speak
  to her was very depressing and stressful, and it was very sad. But what can
  you do?” * First name only used for privacy reasons
