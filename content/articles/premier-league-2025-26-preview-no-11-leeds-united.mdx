  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 17th (NB: this is not necessarily Louise
  Taylor’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season: 1st in
  the Championship Prospects Can Leeds resist the increasingly powerful
  gravitational pull of the Championship? Could they defy the growing
  expectation that, these days, promoted teams will be restricted to one-season
  top-tier stays? Daniel Farke is certainly behaving like a man on a mission to
  avoid immediate relegation and seven summer signings have added much-needed
  height and aggression to last term’s technical but slightly diminutive squad.
  Yet while the arrivals of Lucas Perri, Jaka Bijol, Sebastiaan Bornouw, Gabriel
  Gudmundsson, Sean Longstaff and Anton Stach have fortified the goalkeeping,
  defensive and midfield departments, Lukas Nmecha remains the sole attacking
  signing. Given Patrick Bamford has been told he will be sold and Mateo Joseph
  and Joe Gelhardt have left on season-long loans Leeds are racing against time
  to rebuild the front end of the team. “We are not naive,” Farke said after the
  1-1 friendly against Villarreal. “We know that in the offence we are not ready
  for Premier League level. We know that even in comparison to our Championship
  offence you could say that we are not much improved. “I can’t guarantee that
  for the first game everything will be ready and we are fully equipped but we
  definitely have to make sure that, latest, after the first international break
  in September, we have a really competitive squad for the Premier League. We’re
  not anxious but we are fully aware we need to do something.” In the interim,
  Joël Piroe, last season’s Championship golden boot winner, has a chance to
  show he is a top-tier striker. If the imports look sound – and the Slovenia
  centre-half Bijol, a £15m buy from Udinese, seems a particularly shrewd
  purchase – an awful lot hinges on how swiftly they adapt. Leeds fans must hope
  the team’s framework is sufficiently robust to showcase the talents of last
  season’s stars, most notably the Wales winger Dan James and the Japan
  midfielder Ao Tanaka. The manager Too many managerial media addresses are
  anodyne, but the amiable Farke, almost always interesting and evidently
  emotionally intelligent, is a welcome exception to the rule. The one-time
  economics student with the look of a former heavy metal star has achieved
  three promotions to the Premier League, the first two with financially
  challenged Norwich sides. The 48-year-old German remained dignified in the
  face of intense speculation regarding his Elland Road future last May. The
  Leeds chair, Paraag Marathe, ended it by declaring “he’s my man, but the task
  is undeniably formidable. As Farke says: “In the past 21 years, Leeds have
  spent three seasons in the Premier League but that’s where this club belongs.
  My job is to keep us here.” Off-field picture Running Leeds has always been
  challenging, but the San Francisco-based 49er Enterprises is faced with the
  tricky task of staying on the right side of profitability and sustainability
  rules while remaining competitive on the pitch. This balancing act is only
  complicated by the reality that promotion has coincided with a major
  redevelopment project intended to expand Elland Road’s capacity to 53,000.
  With a formal planning application now submitted to the city council, building
  work could start before Christmas. While Robbie Evans, an analytics expert, is
  the club’s new managing director and replaces the former CEO Angus Kinnear,
  who is now at Everton, the long-serving Adam Underwood has been promoted to
  sporting director. Star signing Farke believes England’s domestic market
  represents bad value, but central midfielder Longstaff has been bought from
  Newcastle for an initial £12m, potentially rising to £15m. Only the excellence
  of Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães and Joelinton kept the cricket-loving
  Tynesider out of Eddie Howe’s first XI, but he is too good not to be playing
  regularly. With 171 Premier League appearances behind him, Longstaff brings
  invaluable experience and is an excellent character off the field, always
  ready to support and encourage teammates. Games are often won and lost in
  midfield and with Longstaff, Stach, Ethan Ampadu, Tanaka and Illia Gruev
  competing for places, the engine room appears well staffed. Stepping up Harry
  Gray, the grandson of Frank Gray and great nephew of Eddie from the Leeds
  sides of the 1970s, and the younger brother of Tottenham’s Archie Gray, is a
  poised, two-footed striker, equally adept as a No 9 or a No 10. The England
  Under-17 international has made one first-team appearance last season and does
  not turn 17 until October, but his cool, incisive finishing, precocious
  technique and advanced ability to read the game dictates he is the subject of
  considerable excitement at the club. Leeds are anxious not to rush Gray’s
  development, but Premier League defenders are unlikely to relish being
  introduced to his precocious skill set. A big season for … “I probably have
  something to prove in the Premier League,” said Wilfried Gnonto this summer.
  It is important to remember that his exquisite dribbling skills and
  extraordinary change of pace belong to a winger who does not turn 22 until
  November. Gnonto has 13 Italy caps, but his challenge is to establish hitherto
  elusive consistency and nail down a regular place in the starting XI. Few
  top-tier defenders will welcome the experience of him running at themand the
  time has come for Gnonto to eliminate erraticism from his game.
