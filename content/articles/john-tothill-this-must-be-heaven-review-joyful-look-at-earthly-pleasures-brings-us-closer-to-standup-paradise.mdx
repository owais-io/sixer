  John Tothill: This Must Be Heaven review – joyful look at earthly pleasures
  brings us closer to standup paradise
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  Both his previous shows having almost killed him, the bar for success is set
  low for John Tothill at this year’s fringe. But you wouldn’t bet against this
  cat with nine lives high-achieving his way to award recognition this year, so
  confident is his comic voice, so frothy and delightful the hour we spend in
  his company. Rare is the standup with nary a grump, not a whisper of
  self-importance nor a scintilla of cynicism – just effervescent joy taken in
  our company, the world and so many wonderful things in it. And erudition, too,
  and surprising ideas to undergird the giddy comedy. An act much given to
  sweeping historico-cultural theses attends in This Must Be Heaven to gluttony,
  its distinction from greed, and how it challenges the individualism of our
  age. Tothill’s case study is the Georgian-era guzzler Edward Dando, who ate
  oysters by the barrowload and refused to pay for them. What a hero, argues our
  host – at least once he’s dispensed all the absolutely essential gossip that
  forms the first third of the show. How much of that is extemporised, who
  knows, as the Essex man riffs ecstatically on how his audience is dressed, on
  a trip to the Margate Crab Museum, and on a dread experience he recently had
  gigging aboard a cruise ship. (“It made the House of Lords look like Love
  Island.”) No one is better at making this stuff seem as if it’s tripping
  apropos of nothing off his tongue, and few bring to it such vivacity. A buffet
  interaction on that fateful cruise gives the show its moral, which is to be
  grateful not grizzly at the abundance life puts our way. You might ascribe
  that life-affirming credo, shot through the entire act, to the most recent of
  Tothill’s brushes with death: he gives us a lurid account here of the exploded
  appendix that up-ended his 2024 fringe. Perhaps the “stupid and immature” (his
  doctor’s words) recklessness that risked ending it all is the flipside of
  Tothill’s zest for life, this committed self-indulger’s paradoxical negation
  of the self. Here’s to him safely surviving the fringe this month; he’s
  certainly thriving at it. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August
  • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
