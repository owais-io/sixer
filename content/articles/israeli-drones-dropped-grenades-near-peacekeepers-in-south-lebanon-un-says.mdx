  Israeli drones dropped four grenades near UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon,
  the agency’s force said on Wednesday, in what it described as “one of the most
  serious attacks” on its personnel since a November ceasefire. The UN
  peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said the Tuesday morning attack came as
  it was clearing a road to a UN position close to the Israeli border, adding
  that no one was hurt. The attack came despite Unifil informing the Israeli
  military in advance of where and when it would be conducting roadwork in south
  Lebanon. It was “one of the most serious attacks on Unifil personnel and
  assets” since the November ceasefire that ended the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah
  war, the force said. Peacekeepers were working to clear roadblocks preventing
  access to a UN position south-east of the village of Marwahin when an Israeli
  drone dropped one grenade 20 metres away and three more 100 metres away from
  UN personnel and vehicles. After the attack, Israeli drones were seen
  returning towards Israel. The force stopped the work “out of concern for the
  safety of peacekeepers following the incident”, Unifil said. It added that any
  attack on peacekeepers or interference with its mission was a serious
  violation of international law and that it was the responsibility of the
  Israeli military to ensure the safety of UN forces in south Lebanon. The
  attack came days after the UN security council ordered the withdrawal of the
  peacekeeping mission at the end of next year after nearly half a century,
  following intense US and Israeli pressure. The peacekeeping force was first
  established in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south
  Lebanon, but after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war was tasked with monitoring
  violations of UN resolution 1701, which acted as a ceasefire. Unifil cannot
  use force except in cases of self-defence, but instead notifies the Lebanese
  army of ceasefire violations. Israeli forces attacked Unifil peacekeepers more
  than two dozen times during the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war that ended in
  November, while Hezbollah also hit the peacekeeping mission on several
  occasions. Peacekeepers are considered civilians under international law and
  intentional targeting of them is illegal. Israel has long criticised Unifil
  for being lax on Hezbollah, a claim the force rebuffs. The US in recent months
  has drawn closer to Israel’s position and backed the ending of the mission – a
  move it styled as boosting the sovereignty of the Lebanese army over its own
  country. The peacekeeping force has also come under pressure from Hezbollah,
  with patrols frequently blocked by local residents, due to a popular
  perception that Unifil is serving Israeli interests in the area. The
  government of Lebanon, for its part, relies on Unifil as a buffer with Israel
  and as support for its underequipped and understaffed army. The government is
  currently drafting a plan to take concrete steps to disarm Hezbollah and other
  armed non-state groups in the country, with the Lebanese army tasked with
  carrying out the plan. The Hezbollah-Israel war severely weakened the group,
  and in combination with the ousting of its longtime ally the former president
  of Syria Bashar al-Assad, loosened the militia’s tight grip on the country.
  Unifil has helped the army in its disarmament of south Lebanon, which is part
  of the November ceasefire agreement. Israel was also meant to fully withdraw
  from south Lebanon under the terms of the ceasefire, but has said it will not
  do so until Hezbollah is fully disarmed. The Lebanese government has condemned
  Israel’s continued presence in Lebanon post-ceasefire, as well as its near
  daily airstrikes on the country, which it says are aimed at preventing
  Hezbollah from reconstituting itself. The continued airstrikes have bolstered
  Hezbollah in its narrative that the militia is needed to defend the country –
  a narrative the Lebanese government has rejected as it seeks to restore its
  monopoly on violence.
