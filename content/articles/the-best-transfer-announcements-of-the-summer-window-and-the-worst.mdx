  Alejandro Gómez, free agent to Padova Sometimes it’s best not to
  overcomplicate things. The former Atalanta playmaker Alejandro “Papu” Gómez
  loves a dance (his hit single Dance Like the Papu went viral in 2017) and
  Padua is an absolutely gorgeous city in northern Italy, so this Saturday Night
  Fever-inspired transfer announcement video for the Argentinian that showcases
  both works a charm. In what feels like a high-quality production, the 2022
  World Cup winner struts around the city in 1970s clobber: a leather jacket, an
  enormously lappelled shirt and a vintage pair of Copa Mundials, all to the
  sound of the Bee Gees’ Stayin’ Alive. The context of this transfer to the
  Serie B side is that Gómez is finishing a two-year doping ban after taking a
  banned substance, which the now 37-year-old claimed came from his son’s cough
  medicine. Gómez, fifth on the all-time list of Serie A assists, continues to
  train independently but can start training with his new Padova teammates on 19
  August. Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford to Manchester United A slightly different one
  in that this was not an announcement video but a farewell, as Bryan Mbeumo
  issued an Interstellar-themed message to Brentford supporters before his move
  to Manchester United. This could have gone badly wrong (and the thought of
  another Interstellar-themed video in the future where Mbeumo is shouting
  “Don’t let me leave, Brentford” to himself is a tempting one) but the Cameroon
  forward pitches it perfectly here, as he recreates the incredible scene where
  Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, looks back over years of messages left
  by his children. There are some heartfelt moments in Mbeumo’s video: his first
  Brentford goal, his special relationship with supporters and teammates and his
  memories of Brentford’s promotion to the Premier League. “6 years that felt
  like 6 minutes,” reads the accompanying caption to the video. “It’s time to
  take off and to leave the Bees Planet. But before I go, I want to thank all of
  you. It was an incredible journey full of emotion, smile, laugh and you made
  every moment very special. You’ll always have my heart. We’ll meet again in
  this dimension and in the others.” Saúl Ñíguez, Atlético Madrid to Flamengo A
  fairly obvious pun was the catalyst for this Better Call Saul-themed poster,
  with Saúl’s head neatly photoshopped on top of Saul Goodman’s body. The image
  might also be a veiled nod to the call that Saúl received from his former
  Atlético Madrid teammate Filipe Luís, now head coach at Flamengo. Saúl was on
  the verge of signing for Trabzonspor after verbally agreeing a deal with the
  Turkish club but backed out at the last minute, citing “personal stuff”,
  leading to a furious statement from Trabzonspor’s head coach Fatih Tekke: “Let
  those who don’t want Trabzon have their fun. We will find a better one.” Paul
  Pogba, free agent to Monaco Another World Cup winner back from a lengthy
  doping ban, Paul Pogba’s return to football with Monaco struck a very
  different vibe to Alejandro Gómez. Pogba’s announcement video, entitled La
  Renaissance, is more pensive but still slick, with his unmistakeable energy
  and confidence on show. “Like a kid all excited for his first day of school,”
  narrates the Frenchman. But a secondary video showing a tearful Pogba actually
  signing his contract has far more impact. In contrast to the first
  choreographed video, Pogba’s raw emotion comes to the fore here as his doping
  ban, injuries and legal cases seem to melt away with the resumption of his
  career. “I’m sorry – thank you for your trust,” blurts out Pogba to Monaco’s
  sporting director, Thiago Scuro, with the midfielder barely able to get the
  words out. “It is very rare to see me cry like that, so I hope you enjoyed
  it,” Pogba later reflected. “There were so many images that came into my mind.
  We know the doping story, my injury. Everything came back to me during the
  signing and I couldn’t hold back.” Luuk de Jong, PSV to Porto The most
  surprising transfer announcement of this transfer window is Porto’s signing of
  Luuk de Jong, whose arrival was kept completely under wraps until an
  in-person, real-time reveal in front of the fans at the Estádio do Dragão
  before a pre-season friendly. In an age when journalists and fans are
  seemingly privy to transfer detail, De Jong’s deal was a complete secret, and
  the idea of Porto’s president, André Villas-Boas. With a baseball cap pulled
  over his head, the 6ft 2in De Jong was lucky not to be seen at Porto airport
  when he arrived on Sunday, but was smuggled into a taxi without anyone
  noticing. Even De Jong’s medical was booked as a new player for Porto’s
  handball team (De Jong’s parents were both professional volleyball players) as
  the club scrambled to keep his arrival from leaking. After meeting his new
  teammates in the dressing room before the match, the Dutch striker walked out
  of the tunnel around 6pm to shock the fans. And the worst one … Burnley have
  carved out a niche in creating unique transfer announcements in the recent
  past but their Lionel Richie-themed one for Kyle Walker this summer is quite
  something. Excruciating acting by the England defender and a bizarre concept.
  Nope.
