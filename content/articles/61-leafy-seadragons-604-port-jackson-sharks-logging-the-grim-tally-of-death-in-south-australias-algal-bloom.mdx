  61 leafy seadragons, 604 Port Jackson sharks: logging the grim tally of death
  in South Australia’s algal bloom

  Sixty-one leafy seadragons, 604 Port Jackson sharks, 1,999 southern fiddler
  rays and 287 bluespotted goatfish make up a fraction of the dead washed up on
  South Australian beaches in the past months. Since the algal bloom hit SA,
  hundreds of citizen scientists have come together to create what has become
  one of the main sources of data on the disaster. Now more than 34,000 dead
  marine animals and fish have been logged by more than 900 observers – while,
  of course, far more have gone unobserved. The bloom crept around the coast in
  March, unnoticed by most, until a surfer, Anthony Rowland, gave a colourful
  description of his and his mates’ hacking coughs after being in the water at
  Waitpinga, raising the alarm. Next, pictures emerged of a mysterious, scummy
  foam on nearby beaches. Then an algal bloom community, determined to do what
  they could, started to take shape. Sign up: AU Breaking News email An
  ecologist, Faith Coleman, who has become a leading expert on the bloom, got in
  touch with Rowland. “I sent him a Facebook message and a couple of questions,”
  she says. “One was, ‘Are you OK? I hear you’re really frustrated’, and the
  next was, ‘Can I do anything to help?’” Someone else volunteered to courier a
  sample of the algae to Coleman and her mother, Peri Coleman. The pair run an
  ecological consulting firm and were able to test the sample and confirm it was
  Karenia mikimotoi (others were also toiling away on identification). And so
  the mystery of the mucky foam was at least partly solved, although there are
  other Karenia species in the bloom and more questions to be answered.
  Meanwhile, Brad Martin, SA project manager with the not-for-proift OzFish, and
  a marine ecologist, Janine Baker, seized the opportunity to set up a place
  where people could report what they were seeing in an organised way. The
  iNaturalist app became the platform for an extraordinary citizen science
  project. “There were a lot of photos on social media and in the media, which
  is great,” Martin says. “But not so useful if you’re trying to get scientific
  information about what’s been impacted. “The obvious advantage of the project
  is it’s public. Everyone can see it. The community can use it, researchers can
  use it, the government can use it.” Observers have now logged almost 500
  species with the SA Marine Mortality Events 2025 project. They range from the
  most commonly found (2,384 bluefin leatherjackets) to much rarer sightings –
  just one striped pyjama bottletail, one south-eastern biscuit star, one
  bighead gurnard perch – although these numbers are all changing daily, if not
  hourly. With so many people logging their observations, double counting does
  happen, Martin says. And at the same time only some of the dead are observed –
  some will come and go with the tides, or remain unseen on remote beaches or
  under the water. “But we get to see trends as it moves around,” he says.
  Coleman says: “It’s hugely useful.” Filling another knowledge gap, the Great
  Southern Reef Foundation has been gathering evidence of what is happening
  under the water, where reefs and seagrass meadows are devastated. They are
  also part of a movement lobbying governments to do more. In 2023 the
  foundation wrote to the federal government warning of the likely impact of
  marine heatwaves, a critical trigger for algal blooms. It wrote again in May
  calling for a $40m, 10-year investment in a monitoring program. State and
  federal governments have since opened up sources of funding and there is a
  $28m joint fund for science and research, to support local communities and
  industries, and to keep the public informed. Coleman is critical of what she
  says was a slow government reaction that created a vacuum that allowed
  conspiracy theories to form. But she says there’s an upside: “It enabled this
  community collective thing with everyone using their skills towards the
  greatest good. “We’ve got a beautiful community; we seem to trust each other
  more than we trust government.” Coleman says there is still a lot to learn.
  Karenia species are always evolving and it’s impossible to pin down exactly
  what species are in the bloom, where and in what amounts. So far we only know
  a “drop in the ocean”, she says. Some species emit brevetoxins, which can
  accumulate in shellfish and cause neurological symptoms in humans who eat
  them. Different labs can report different results, and some species are
  incorrectly identified, while some species show up as brevetoxins on a screen
  even though technically they’re not. “It’s the murkiest situation you can
  possibly imagine,” Coleman says. But researchers are hard at work and
  benefiting from the citizen science under way. Martin says the iNaturalist
  project is “community-owned” with support from OzFish, and that OzFish is
  using the information in the restoration work it was already doing – work that
  could help mitigate blooms in the future. OzFish works with fishers and the
  community to protect and restore waterways. It has been restoring seagrass
  meadows, which have been ravaged by runoff, pollution and physical damage.
  Those meadows, when healthy, can help increase the resilience of the ecosystem
  and buffer against algal blooms. OzFish is also constructing and restoring
  shellfish reefs with native oysters. Experts are sceptical that existing
  mitigation methods will work on the scale of SA’s bloom. But those reefs
  provide a ray of hope – it turns out that native oysters eat Karenia
  mikimotoi. “The community-led shellfish reef restoration has had some exciting
  results – native oysters not only surviving, they’re growing,” Martin says.
