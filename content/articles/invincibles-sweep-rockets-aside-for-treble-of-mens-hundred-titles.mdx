  We have seen this one before. For the third year in a row Oval Invincibles
  rocked up to Lord’s, batted first and ended up with the trophy. As the Hundred
  signed off on its opening chapter – next year will bring new owners,
  rebranding and potentially an extreme makeover of squads – this was a fitting
  result, the Invincibles men having been the standout side for much of it. Will
  Jacks and Nathan Sowter, both of whom played in the Invincibles’ first match
  in 2021, were the ones responsible this time, with Trent Rockets falling to a
  26-run defeat. Jacks provided the hits in the first half, finishing with 72
  off 41 balls as the Invincibles put up 168, and Sowter ruined the chase
  quickly. A 10-ball set by the leg-spinner accounted for the Rockets’ top three
  of Tom Banton, Joe Root and Rehan Ahmed. Marcus Stoinis briefly threatened
  with 64 off 38, but it never turned into a serious fright. There probably will
  not be a Last Dance-style docuseries in 25 years on the Invincibles’ Hundred
  success, with Sam Curran puffing on a cigar as he explains his takedown of Sam
  Cook at the Oval. But the south London side have been thoroughly watchable,
  finishing top of the league stage in three successive seasons, their
  excellence driven by a stable set of players. They entered this contest with
  nine of the XI from the final last year, confident enough to leave Gus
  Atkinson on the bench. “It’s nice to play with people that have been with this
  team for five years,” said the Invincibles’ Jordan Cox, the leading run-scorer
  this season. A new player recruitment system next year could rip that
  connection up. “We’ll try our best to keep a little group together but the
  cricket world’s changing, whatever they do, the people in the hierarchy can
  decide that. We’ll just play cricket and try and entertain.” The Rockets
  arrived after a rain-ruined eliminator the night before, their second-place
  finish sending Northern Superchargers out. Their run was powered by the energy
  of Ahmed, the 21‑year‑old twirling his leg-breaks while batting at No 3, and
  very capable of carrying that charisma into a Lord’s final. But this remained
  a difficult task for the Rockets made harder by an injury sustained by Lockie
  Ferguson in the warmups, prompting the last‑second introduction of Dillon
  Pennington for his first game of this year’s tournament. Pennington was the
  first to strike after the Invincibles batted first, his opening delivery a
  wide loosener to Tawanda Muyeye. An invitation to send the ball into the
  grandstand was rejected, Muyeye edging behind for 15. But the opening
  exchanges still belonged to the Invincibles as Jacks thumped away while Cox
  settled in at the other end. Stoinis thought he had Jacks caught in the deep
  but the full toss was a touch too high, prompting the no-ball call. Ahmed’s
  stump‑to‑stump fizz was handled, too, Jacks getting the reverse sweep out to
  find the boundary. The Invincibles had 83 runs after 50 balls. Ben Sanderson
  was pummelled through the off-side and George Linde felt double pain from a
  dropped chance; the left-arm spinner failed to take a return catch off Cox and
  the blow to the hand forced him off the field. Jacks tonked Ahmed over
  midwicket to bring up his half-century off 32 balls, with the Rockets
  threatening to disintegrate. Ahmed did account for Cox on 40, but Jacks
  remained locked in, driving Pennington over extra cover for six and perishing
  with 15 balls left in the innings. The Rockets strolled out with their two
  leading run-scorers, Banton and the ever-evolving Root. After a 32-run
  powerplay, some hoo-ha was needed against spin. Adam Zampa was the big-name
  leggie in the Invincibles lineup but it was his less heralded colleague who
  broke through. Sowter, one of two players in the XI without an international
  cap, invited a Root launch to Jacks at long-on and rattled Ahmed’s stumps for
  a duck. Sam Billings kept Sowter on for another five, a call that resulted in
  a miscue from Banton. Ten consecutive deliveries resulted in three runs and
  three wickets, Sowter in effect bringing the match to an end with 60 balls to
  spare. A new-look tournament awaits, though the prospect of a switch to
  Twenty20 does not appeal to Cox. “I absolutely love the [Hundred] format, I
  think it’s the best format,” he said, questioning the value of competing with
  the Indian Premier League. “What’s the point in trying to change it to be
  second best? Why ruin it?”
