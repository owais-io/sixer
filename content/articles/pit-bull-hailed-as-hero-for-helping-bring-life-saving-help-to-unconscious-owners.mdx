  A dog reportedly braved heavy traffic to catch a stranger’s attention and get
  life-saving emergency help to the animal’s two owners after they became
  unresponsive in a tent encampment in Pittsburgh recently, earning the canine
  feting as a hero. As local resident Gary Thynes put it both in a social media
  post and an interview with the Pittsburgh television station WTAE, he was
  playing with his dog at a park on the evening of 29 July when a pit bull
  approached barking and evidently trying to get someone’s attention. Thynes
  left his dog with a friend and then began following as he was led away by the
  pit bull. He and the animal crossed a street teeming with motorists and ended
  up at a tent encampment along a “super secluded” path behind some train
  tracks, where Thynes found a man lying on a red couch and unsuccessfully tried
  to wake him, he recounted on Facebook. He told WTAE that he also spotted an
  unconscious woman whose legs were sticking out of a tent. Thynes called 911 to
  report the scene to first responders, who arrived within minutes to take the
  pair to the hospital, he later posted on Facebook. Pittsburgh’s public safety
  department later confirmed to media outlets that a man and a woman – both
  unresponsive – had been taken from the encampment to the hospital. “We are
  grateful to our public safety partners and the good samaritan who were in the
  area and were in a position to help,” officials also said. Thynes wrote that
  he soon encountered a social worker who knew the two people taken to the
  hospital were unhoused. The social worker also knew the dog who led Thynes to
  the two people was theirs, he wrote. Instead of leaving the dog in the custody
  of a local pound, Thynes wrote that he agreed to care for the pit bull while
  the animal’s owners remained hospitalized. “It is an honor for me to take care
  of this guy until his humans are well enough to reunite with a dog that loves
  them very much,” said Thynes, whose post and interview on WTAE gained
  widespread attention online. Thynes told WTAE that the pit bull he is
  fostering “is a persistent little puppy, … amazing, and … definitely saved
  some lives”. Furthermore, he shared on Facebook that he is in recovery from
  heroin addiction and said he was “so glad sobriety … put me in tune with my
  intuition more” on the day he met the attentive animal. “The experience has
  been surreal but it only reaffirms to me that God is real and he speaks to you
  … if you choose to listen,” Thynes wrote. “And I’m so glad that I did.”
  Officials did not immediately share details about the two people’s conditions
  or what had caused them to become unresponsive. Yet among those who have
  contributed to a flood of commentary on Thynes’s Facebook page was a user who
  wrote: “This is the woman [whose] life you and my dog saved – my boyfriend and
  I would love to meet you.” A separate comment from the same user under a
  picture of the pit bull, which Thynes hashtagged “herodog”, said: “Thank you …
  momma can’t wait to get home to you.” Thynes replied to the user, who referred
  to the pit bull as East O: “He’s all good! He will be here when you are
  ready.” “We will forever be in debt to you,” the user identifying as the dog’s
  owner wrote to Thynes in another exchange. Thynes responded: “I’m so glad
  you’re both OK. I know it’s hard. I’ve been there … it can get better.” The
  pit bull pup is not the only one who has flagged down life-saving aid from
  first responders. In September, a dog saved her owner – who hurt his leg at
  home in rural Washington state, fell and couldn’t get up for hours – by
  walking to a road, sitting in the middle of it until a local sheriff’s deputy
  stopped, and leading the officer to him. A few months before that, a dog ran
  four miles to get help for his owner who crashed his car into a ravine in
  Oregon. That dog’s owner was ultimately rescued. And in January 2024, a man
  who plunged through the ice on a frozen Michigan lake was saved when his dog
  brought him rescue equipment at the direction of a state police officer who
  then pulled the animal’s owner to safety. One of the Facebook comments left
  for Thynes pointed out how he had labeled the pit bull in his case “a hero”.
  “But,” the post said, “you are too!”
