  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Ed
  Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 2nd Prospects Mikel Arteta vowed this would be a “big summer” after
  finishing as runners-up in the Premier League for a third season in succession
  and the new sporting director, Andrea Berta, has delivered on a number of
  signings in his first transfer window. The question now for Arsenal supporters
  is whether Martín Zubimendi, Christian Nørgaard, Noni Madueke, Viktor
  Gyökeres, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga can help them take that
  elusive final step to becoming champions for the first time since the
  Invincibles in 2004. The arrival of Gyökeres will certainly quieten the
  clamour for a new No 9 that has rumbled on for several years, although the
  pressure will immediately be on the Sweden striker to hit the ground running.
  The longstanding target Zubimendi should provide metronomic accuracy at the
  base of a new-look midfield that Arteta will hope can continue to get the best
  out of Declan Rice and rejuvenate the captain, Martin Ødegaard, while Madueke
  will surely provide much better back-up for their talisman Bukayo Saka than
  Raheem Sterling managed last season and could also push Gabriel Martinelli for
  a starting place on the left flank. But even with the teenage sensations Myles
  Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri having committed their futures to the club
  after enjoying outstanding breakthrough seasons, there remain concerns about a
  lack of creativity in the squad. A move for Crystal Palace’s FA Cup hero
  Eberechi Eze could depend on players departing before the end of August to
  balance the books. Yet while Arsenal may end up paying more than £200m for the
  additions to their squad so far, seeing champions Liverpool comfortably
  outspend them after finishing 10 points ahead last season has left many fans
  wondering if they have gone far enough. The squad definitely looks stronger
  than this time last year but with other rivals also closing in, it could be
  make or break for Arteta. The manager Ending yet another campaign without
  silverware was a bitter pill to swallow for Arteta, who celebrated his fifth
  anniversary in charge just before Christmas. A solitary FA Cup a few months
  after his appointment is not a fair reflection on the progress Arsenal have
  made since then – especially given the run to the Champions League semi-finals
  last season – but Arteta knows he will be ultimately judged on delivering
  titles. He made no secret of his frustration over the lack of cover in
  Arsenal’s squad as the injuries mounted up last year. With plenty of
  reinforcements now added, Arteta must seize his opportunity. Off-field picture
  The surprise departure of Edu Gaspar in November disrupted plans for the
  January transfer window but Berta has provided some fresh perspective since
  joining in March. Arsenal’s American owner, Kroenke Sports &amp;
  Entertainment, was rated as the most valuable sports ownership group on the
  planet in July at an estimated $21.3bn (£16.1bn) thanks to a portfolio that
  also includes the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and the
  NBA’s Denver Nuggets. So funding another summer spending spree wasn’t an issue
  after keeping the powder relatively dry last year. It – like Arsenal’s
  supporters, who pay for one of the most expensive season tickets in the
  country – however, will want a return for its investment at some point. Star
  signing No Arsenal player managed 10 goals in the Premier League last season
  so the onus is on Gyökeres – who scored a staggering 97 goals in 102 games for
  Sporting – to fill the void. The only issue is that the 27-year-old never
  played in English football’s top flight despite being on Brighton’s books and
  then excelling in the Championship for Coventry. He will be expecting to get
  plenty of opportunities in a side that usually dominate their opponents in
  midfield but struggled to break teams down last season, drawing 14 times in
  the league. Having eventually opted for Gyökeres rather than RB Leipzig’s
  Benjamin Sesko or Alexander Isak of Newcastle, Arsenal must now find a way to
  utilise his obvious strengths. Stepping up It is highly probable that only
  Premier League regulations prevented Max Dowman from taking Nwaneri’s record
  as the competition’s youngest ever player last season. The attacking
  midfielder has been training with Arsenal’s first team squad since celebrating
  his 15th birthday at the turn of the year and was described as “special” by
  Arteta after coming off the bench to win a penalty in their pre-season win
  against Newcastle in Singapore. “What he’s done against this team in the time
  that he had on the pitch is something certainly not common to witness for a
  15-year-old,” he said. Dowman is expected to be handed an opportunity sooner
  rather than later and it will be intriguing to see what impact he can have. A
  big season for … Martin Ødegaard was the first to admit that his performances
  last season lacked their usual sparkle, with a return of three league goals
  his lowest since moving to north London permanently in 2021. The 26-year-old
  captain was also substituted on 12 occasions after missing part of the season
  due to an ankle injury as he struggled to find his best form. The Norwegian
  must rekindle his relationship with Saka that has proved so effective down the
  years, while Arteta will be hoping that Gyökeres can finish off some of the
  chances Ødegaard will inevitably create given the lack of other options
  besides the inexperienced Nwaneri and Dowman.
