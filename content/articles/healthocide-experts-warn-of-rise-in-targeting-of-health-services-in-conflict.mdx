  Targeting medics and hospitals in acts of war should be called “healthocide”,
  academics have urged, amid an increase in such attacks in recent years. Health
  services are increasingly deliberately under attack and medics are facing
  violence and abuse in conflict zones around the world – in particular in Gaza,
  but also in Lebanon, Ukraine, Sudan and Syria. This is despite the
  longstanding principle under international humanitarian law of medical
  neutrality, which protects healthcare workers and facilities during armed
  conflict and civil unrest, enabling them to provide medical care to those in
  need. In a commentary published in the BMJ Global Health, Dr Joelle Abi-Rached
  and colleagues of the American University of Beirut, Lebanon wrote: “Both in
  Gaza and Lebanon, healthcare facilities have not only been directly targeted,
  but access to care has also been obstructed, including incidents where
  ambulances have been prevented from reaching the injured, or deliberately
  attacked. “What is becoming clear is that healthcare workers and facilities
  are no longer afforded the protection guaranteed by international humanitarian
  law.” The authors cite data from Israel’s full-scale invasion of Gaza, which
  has resulted in at least 986 medical workers’ deaths. Recent figures from the
  Healthcare Workers Watch show that 28 doctors from Gaza are being held inside
  Israeli prisons without any charge, eight them senior consultants in surgery,
  orthopaedics, intensive care, cardiology and paediatrics. The World Health
  Organization’s representative for the West Bank and Gaza stated at the UN
  security council in January that hospitals in Gaza had “turned into
  battlegrounds”, while the healthcare system was being “systematically
  dismantled and driven to the brink of collapse”. Healthcare workers in Gaza
  who were among the hundreds detained by the Israeli military who spoke to the
  Guardian for the Doctors in Detention project in early 2025 believed they were
  targeted because they were doctors. They shared harrowing testimonies of
  torture, beatings, starvation and humiliation, including being constantly
  beaten and kept in stress positions for hours at a time, and having loud music
  played nonstop to prevent them from sleeping. They were also denied food,
  water, showers and changes of clothes. Lebanon’s ministry of public health has
  found that between 8 October 2023 and 27 January 2025, 217 healthcare workers
  were killed by the Israel Defense Forces, 177 ambulances were damaged, and 68
  attacks on hospitals were recorded. Figures from the Safeguarding Health in
  Conflict Coalition recorded 3,623 attacks on or obstruction of healthcare in
  2024, the highest number ever documented. These attacks included doctors,
  nurses and allied healthcare professionals who were beaten, arbitrarily
  arrested, kidnapped, tortured and killed; patients shot in their beds or
  dragged to detention centres; and hospitals that were deliberately bombed and
  raided. The authors of the BMJ Global Health article are calling on doctors
  not to “forsake the principle of medical neutrality” and speak out against
  “healthocide” or face emboldening future violators. This might include
  advocating for enforcement of justice and international humanitarian law, and
  documenting and exposing abuses of medical neutrality. Writing in the
  Guardian, Maarten van der Heijden, a global health lawyer and researcher at
  the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, noted that the
  international humanitarian laws, the Geneva conventions, leave “considerable
  room for interpretation and forgoes accountability”, allowing hospitals to be
  bombed if it is considered “harmful to the enemy”. The British Medical
  Association’s medical ethics committee chair, Dr Andrew Green, said: “In
  recent years, doctors have been devastated to see the appalling increase in
  attacks on healthcare, patients and staff in conflict zones, and the disregard
  for medical neutrality and international humanitarian law.” He noted that
  although there were examples around the world, Gaza was the most severe given
  that “the population is both at risk of imminent famine, while health systems
  necessary to look after the starving have been systematically obliterated and
  health workers killed and arbitrarily detained.” He urged international
  medical associations, NGOs, governments and the UN to “call out when we see
  human and health rights abused, and hold those breaking international
  humanitarian law accountable”. “Those with power must use all levers at their
  disposal to ensure the provision of humanitarian aid and urgent healthcare to
  the world’s most vulnerable. One clear step would be the establishment of a UN
  special rapporteur on the protection of health in armed conflict,” he added.
  The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office minister Hamish Falconer has
  previously said that the UK government is urging the Israeli authorities to
  ensure that “incidents are investigated transparently and that those
  responsible are held to account and lessons learned”. • This article was
  amended on 6 August 2025. An earlier version said health services are
  deliberately under attack in El Salvador; however, this was given as a
  historical example from the 1980s and has now been removed. Also, the
  commentary was published in BMJ Global Health, not the British Medical
  Journal. A quote said this journal is “calling on doctors to ‘forsake the
  principle of medical neutrality’”; this should have said “not to” forsake
  these ethics.
