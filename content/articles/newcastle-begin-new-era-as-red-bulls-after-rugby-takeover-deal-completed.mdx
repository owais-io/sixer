  Red Bull has completed its takeover of Newcastle Falcons. As revealed
  exclusively in June, the Prem club, who will continue to play at Kingston Park
  and retain Steve Diamond as their director of rugby, will now be known as
  Newcastle Red Bulls. The company already has significant business interests in
  football, motor racing and winter sports. Newcastle finished bottom of the
  Premiership table in the past three seasons, but the new ownership has pledged
  to develop local rugby talent through a “strengthened academy programme” and
  provide “a world-class fan experience”. Oliver Mintzlaff, Red Bull’s CEO of
  corporate projects and investments, said: “Together, we aim to elevate rugby
  to new heights and deliver unforgettable moments for our fans. We’re delighted
  to have acquired Newcastle Red Bulls and look forward to empowering the club
  to reach its full competitive potential.” Simon Massie-Taylor, chief executive
  of Prem Rugby, said: “Red Bull’s takeover of Newcastle is a landmark moment
  for our sport and a powerful endorsement of our vision and strategy for the
  future of the Gallagher Prem.” Newcastle begin the new season on 26 September
  at home to Saracens.
