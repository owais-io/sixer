  Australian author Helen Garner offered a compliment to the unbelievably
  talented and beautiful Dua Lipa in a recent interview that has caused a
  somewhat personal crisis on my part. She described Lipa as “quietly
  intelligent”. How can I be this? I worry now upon reflection that my intellect
  is too loud. I value intelligence and am, by a long shot, not the smartest in
  my family or friendship circle (which I love and think is very important), but
  there are oft times when I meet new people or have interactions with clients
  that I’ve thought, “Ah, cripes, I didn’t need to say it like that, it sounds
  like I’m showing off.” Eleanor says: I had a similar chat once with a friend
  who moved to the United States for her PhD around the same time I did. When we
  went back home and met new people, they’d say: “What do you do?” We’d say:
  “PhD in America.” They’d say: “Cool, where?” And we’d wince about truthfully
  answering “Princeton”. As though saying so came with a big studio placard:
  applause. Sometimes we’d pretend the question was about geography and say “New
  Jersey” instead. But we both quickly realised that was weirder – like what,
  the news that we’re moderately clever is so trying for strangers back home
  that it’s only polite to conceal it? For heaven’s sake, with ego like that,
  what use is politeness? Point of the story: letting other people see your
  intelligence isn’t necessarily patronising. Carefully concealing it as a
  favour to them sure is. I think the heart of your question is how to reveal
  intelligence in a way that doesn’t feel like asserting hierarchy. And I think
  the heart of the answer is unsticking it from anything much about you. There’s
  a way of thinking about traits such as intelligence – or musicality,
  athleticism or anything we possess in different measures – as gifts that run
  through us, that don’t really redound to our credit. This is not how we’re
  taught to think about them. From when we’re knee high we get on stage and
  clutch certificates rewarding us, such that “aren’t you clever” can feel
  synonymous with “aren’t you marvellous”. But these traits are largely
  heritable and the product of socioeconomic fortune. Hard work is involved, of
  course, but everyone with any kind of talent got it partly by being lucky. If
  you think of your traits as happy hits from the lottery stick, then it doesn’t
  feel so wincey or rude to let them show. They’re just gifts you happened to
  receive, and you can make life nicer and more beautiful by figuring out how to
  share them. Yo-Yo Ma doesn’t refuse to play so as to avoid making other people
  feel bad. I think intelligence feels “quiet” in the Dua Lipa, dignified way
  when it has this quality of generous sharing. It’s about appreciating others’
  minds, and creating more beauty and interest for others. It looks straight
  through to an idea, to the world, not through a lens of: “What does this say
  about me?” In contrast, intelligence feels noisy and show-offy when its bearer
  clearly thinks it’s an exciting feature of them that they have it. That’s when
  it feels like the gifted child deliberately saying a long word for the
  grown-ups. And that’s why it can be every bit as condescending to conceal it
  as to reveal it: the show-off and the mealy mouthed downplayer are both making
  the same egotistical mistake. Maybe the conversation between Dua Lipa and
  Helen Garner that got you thinking about this is also a nice place to find an
  answer. Impressive women, sharing their intelligence with grace and
  generosity. Talent turned outwards for others, not angled in to shine mainly
  on its owner. *** Ask Eleanor a question
