  US defense officials have blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range
  missiles to strike targets inside Russia since late spring as part of a Trump
  administration effort to get Vladimir Putin to engage in peace talks ,
  according to a report on Saturday. The Wall Street Journal reports that the
  Pentagon has blocked Ukraine from using US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems,
  or Atacms. Two US officials told the outlet that on at least one occasion,
  Ukraine had sought to use Atacms against a target but was denied under a
  “review mechanism” developed by Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon’s undersecretary
  for policy, that governs how US long-range weapons or those provided by
  European allies that rely on American intelligence and components can be used.
  The review process also applies to Britain’s Storm Shadow cruise missile
  because it depends on US targeting data, according to two US officials and a
  British official, the Journal said. The review system reportedly gives the US
  defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, approval over the use of the Atacms, which
  have a range of nearly 190 miles (305km). Ukraine was previously given
  authority by the Biden administration to use the missile system against
  targets inside Russia in November after North Korean troops entered the war.
  Before the inauguration in January, Trump told Time magazine that the decision
  to allow Ukraine to use US weapons systems to attack targets inside Russia had
  been a mistake. “I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of
  miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We’re just escalating this war and
  making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done,” he said. It is
  unclear whether the US defense department’s review process amounts to a formal
  policy change. But it comes alongside increasing control of munitions to
  Ukraine as US stocks are themselves depleted. In a statement to the Journal,
  the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Trump “has been very
  clear that the war in Ukraine needs to end. There has been no change in
  military posture in Russia-Ukraine at this time.” But last week, amid efforts
  to broker talks between the Russian president and Voldomyr Zelenskyy, Trump
  said that Ukraine could not defeat Russia unless it could “play offense” in
  the war. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking
  an invader’s country,” Trump wrote on Thursday. “It’s like a great team in
  sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There
  is no chance of winning.” Last month, the US agreed to supply Ukraine with new
  weapons systems but only if European nations paid for them. While Trump has
  said that the US is “not looking” to provide longer-range weapons that could
  reach Moscow, US officials told the Journal that the administration had
  approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition air-launched
  missiles, or Erams, which have a range of 280 miles (400km).
