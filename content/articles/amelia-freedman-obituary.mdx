  Amelia Freedman, who has died aged 84, not only commissioned hundreds of new
  works from leading composers, but also founded a stellar ensemble to give the
  works superlative performances. While studying clarinet at the Royal Academy
  of Music (RAM) she was involved in an initiative to form an ensemble. On being
  told by the other players that she was the only person who could efficiently
  organise such a venture, she relinquished her playing role to take over the
  administration of the ensemble. Her resilience was tested from the start by
  resistance from the RAM principal, Sir Thomas Armstrong (who much later, by
  her account, tried to take credit for offering support). Prevented from using
  the academy’s name in the title, she alighted (at the suggestion of the
  promoter John Woolf) on the Nash Ensemble, after the architect John Nash,
  designer of the imposing terraces adjacent to the conservatoire. Contemporary
  music was always intended to be a central focus of the ensemble, and over the
  following six decades, under Amelia’s aegis, 330 works by 225 composers were
  premiered. Her organisational skills and imaginative programme planning, based
  on a remarkable knowledge of the obscurer corners of the repertory, were put
  to good use, too, in her other major appointments: as artistic director of the
  Bath international festival (1984-93), the Bath Mozartfest (from 1995) and
  Bachfest (from 2012); and head of classical music at the Southbank Centre
  (1995-2006). The daughter of Miriam (nee Claret) and Henry Freedman, Amelia
  was born in north London and educated at St George’s school, Harpenden, and
  Henrietta Barnett school, in Hampstead Garden Suburb, before obtaining the
  LRAM and ARCM diplomas in piano and clarinet respectively. Between 1961 and
  1972 she taught at a succession of schools, and a minor claim to fame was
  staked by her appearance as a backing singer in the Beatles’ film A Hard Day’s
  Night (1964). But it was with the foundation of the Nash that she made her
  mark as a one-woman powerhouse, an administrator and fundraiser nonpareil. Her
  energy and determination in the cause of contemporary music were boundless.
  Even in straitened times she never gave up charming, persuading and cajoling
  as necessary to achieve the desired result. Among the many composers from whom
  she elicited compositions were Harrison Birtwistle, Peter Maxwell Davies,
  David and Colin Matthews, Julian Anderson, Alexander Goehr and Simon Holt.
  While British composers loomed large, she also commissioned from Elliott
  Carter and Tristan Murail, arranged for several Hans Werner Henze premieres in
  the UK and had a good relationship with Henri Dutilleux. The Nash made its
  first appearance outside the RAM at the American embassy, in a concert
  organised by the Park Lane Group and conducted by Graham Treacher in 1965. It
  made its formal debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in 1967 and at the Wigmore
  Hall in the same year. It was soon performing for music societies and
  festivals throughout Britain and Europe. The ensemble had a close relationship
  with the BBC from 1968: many studio and live recordings were to follow. Amelia
  devised enticing themed programmes for the Wigmore Hall, where the Nash became
  a resident chamber ensemble in 2010. Their US debut was at the Alice Tully
  Hall, New York, in 1983, and they subsequently began worldwide tours. A trump
  card Amelia held in her wooing of so many of the world’s leading composers lay
  in their confidence that, with the Nash, they would be assured exemplary
  performances. Other ensembles have commendable track records with commissions;
  Amelia and the Nash were in another league. Supported by Graham Pauncefort’s
  modest independent label CRD, the Nash was able from the start to explore
  adventurous repertory including music by Franz Krommer, Anton Arensky and
  Johann Nepomuk Hummel. Then came Ted Perry’s Hyperion label, on which the
  ensemble was able to make inroads into British composers such as Benjamin
  Britten, Constant Lambert, Arnold Bax, Arthur Bliss, Ralph Vaughan Williams
  and Frank Bridge. Other labels such as Virgin Classics, NMC, Black Box and
  Signum were later proud to have the Nash on their roster too. It has been
  announced that the ensemble will continue under the artistic direction of
  Simon Crawford-Phillips and Adrian Brendel. While the Bath Mozartfest was
  nominally devoted to the work of the Viennese master, under Amelia’s
  stewardship the repertory embraced music from the Renaissance to the 21st
  century. Her catholic tastes and administrative skills informed her incumbency
  at the Southbank Centre, a period notable for the institution’s innovative
  repertoire and lateral thinking. One significant innovation was her
  appointment of an organ curator to oversee renovation of the Royal Festival
  Hall’s instrument and to restore the tradition of an organ recital series. In
  addition to the above roles, she was at different times engaged as a musical
  adviser to the Israel festival, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the London
  Symphony Orchestra and the Barbican. Among the many honours she was awarded
  was the honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society last year. Her
  husband, Michael Miller, a devoted and affable presence by her side in concert
  halls – even if he patently failed to share her enthusiasm for some of the
  more dissonant contemporary scores – died in 2017. She is survived by their
  three children, Andrew, Robert and Emma. • Amelia Freedman, impresario and
  artistic director, born 21 November 1940; died 28 July 2025
