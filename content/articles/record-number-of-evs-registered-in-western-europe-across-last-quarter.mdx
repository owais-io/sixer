  A record number of electric cars were registered in western Europe between
  April and June, as more affordable battery-powered cars came to market,
  according to new research. Nearly 600,000 battery electric vehicles (BEV) hit
  the roads in the last quarter in a boost to sales that had been rising more
  slowly than previously forecast in the last year. The record rollout, which is
  likely to be topped in the current quarter, has come as more affordable BEVs
  enter the market and sales in southern Europe have accelerated, according to
  Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based automotive analyst. “Electric vehicles are
  becoming more affordable and more attractive to private consumers for the
  first time. Previously, it was just corporate consumers, company car drivers,”
  Schmidt said. While electric cars are much cheaper to own than their petrol
  equivalents, they often come with a higher purchase price. However, the
  arrival of smaller and cheaper models is seen as an important step in
  persuading lower-income buyers to make the switch from fossil fuel vehicles.
  European carmakers, such as Citroën-owner Stellantis and Renault, have started
  to introduce more affordable models to attract price-sensitive potential
  buyers and bring down the average emissions of their vehicle fleets in line
  with EU regulations. The continued rollout of the charging network across
  Europe is also helping to remove some potential owners’ range anxiety: the
  name given to drivers’ worries about being able to find a charge point during
  their journey. As a result, quarterly sales across western Europe are
  predicted to exceed 600,000 for the first time between July and September,
  partly thanks to the September release of a new number plate in the UK,
  traditionally boosting sales. Sales of Chinese-made EVs are also rising across
  Europe, particularly those produced by BYD, which is vying with Elon Musk’s
  Tesla to become the world’s biggest electric carmaker and is focusing on sales
  in the UK, Spain and Italy. A quarter of BYD vehicles shipped to Europe end up
  on British roads, Schmidt said. The EU introduced tariffs of up to 35% on
  Chinese-made EVs in late 2024, after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation, a
  move that has not been followed by the UK. Currently one in 10 electric
  vehicles currently on European roads are Chinese-made. In the final months of
  the year, the revival of a social leasing scheme in France combined with the
  re-introduction of a UK government electric vehicle subsidy scheme – which
  will cut the price of some electric cars by up to £3,750 – is also expected to
  increase sales. However, in the UK, a discount of up to 10% will only be
  available for the “greenest” cars and those priced at less than £37,000,
  meaning neither Teslas – which start at about £40,000 – nor Chinese-made cars
  from makers such as BYD will be eligible.
