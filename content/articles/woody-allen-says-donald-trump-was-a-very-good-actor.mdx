  Woody Allen has said he was impressed by the acting abilities of Donald Trump
  when he directed the now-president in the 1998 film Celebrity. Speaking on
  Bill Maher’s Club Random, Allen said Trump was “a pleasure to work with and a
  very good actor”. He continued: “He was very polite, hit his mark, did
  everything correctly and had a real flair for show business. I could direct
  him now. If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I
  could do wonders.” In Allen’s ensemble film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Trump
  has a fleeting scene in which he’s interviewed about his forthcoming projects
  by a TV reporter. In a rare – scripted – instance of irony and deprecation,
  Trump replies that he’s “working on buying St Patrick’s Cathedral. Maybe doing
  a little rip-down job and putting up a very, very tall and beautiful
  building.” Allen went on to say that Trump had a “charismatic quality” in
  front of the camera, was “pleasant, very professional, very polite” and that
  he was “surprised he wanted to go into politics”. He continued: “Politics is
  nothing but headaches and critical decisions and agony. This was a guy I used
  to see at the Knicks games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge
  beauty contests and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing.
  Why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is
  beyond me.” Allen declared that he had personally voted for Kamala Harris in
  the 2024 presidential election. “I disagree with many, almost all, not all,
  but almost all of [Trump’s] politics, of his policies.” He concluded: “I would
  like to direct him now as president and let me make the decisions. But that’s
  not gonna happen.” Allen, whose films are often homages to Russian literature,
  recently attracted criticism for his virtual attendance at a Moscow film
  festival honouring the director. In a statement issued afterwards, Allen
  clarified that “when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly
  that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong”.
