  Like Jonathan Freedland (The world’s in flames. But these are the ways I’ve
  found hope this summer amid the gloom, 8 August), I seek ways of finding hope
  in the face of overwhelming news. Jonathan rightly finds hope in sport and
  popular music. There’s a category he misses. We are in the midst of the BBC
  Proms, and, here in Scotland, the Edinburgh International Festival, where,
  earlier this month, a large orchestra of teenagers from New York showed what
  joy can come from classical music. The young folk from NYO2 practised, worked
  together, took instruction from an inspiring conductor and produced a
  brilliant, ebullient wall of sound and harmony. And they had a whale of a
  time. The Proms, too, offer new creativity alongside well-known favourites.
  Look, if you will, at the pleasure on the faces of the Prommers. There is
  hope, and one of its forms is classical music. Colin Brown Edinburgh • I
  couldn’t agree more with Jonathan Freedland. My family and I recently went to
  Stratford to watch the Royal Shakespeare Company’s stellar production of The
  Winter’s Tale. With its powerful depiction of the terrible evil that humans
  are capable of, as well as the abilities of both love and time to heal,
  Shakespeare’s sublime words reminded us that in deepest despair, we must
  indeed try to glimpse the stars. Catherine Jessop London • Our most used
  banner in Tyneside Extinction Rebellion is entitled “Climate anxiety? The
  remedy is action.” Jonathan Freedland writes of watching cricket and seeing
  the “obsessive pursuit of excellence” as an antidote to the problems
  overwhelming the world. We believe that action is the best remedy, both to
  give us hope and to tackle the problems. And as an example of the pursuit of
  excellence, let us praise the action of the 532 people arrested in Parliament
  Square last weekend: this is what gives me hope. Tony Waterston Newcastle upon
  Tyne • Reading Jonathan Freedland’s piece is an excellent example of escapism
  and the vision it promotes of what humans can achieve in the most desperate of
  circumstances. But the determination of us little folk to fight against the
  odds is no match for the greed, ignorance, short-termism, political cowardice
  and persuasive distraction of the world’s ruling elite. Unfortunately for life
  on Earth, that balance will not shift until the ivory towers of the powerful
  are no longer proof against lethal heat, rampant disease, limited habitable
  space (with consequent global strife), dead oceans and catastrophic climate
  events. Then the mighty will share with us all a future that is not uncertain
  – but very short. Peter Lowe Newcastle upon Tyne • I loved Jonathan
  Freedland’s piece. Escapism is essential for all. It reminded me of the Monty
  Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief album, which contains a sketch between
  George Bernard Shaw, James Whistler and Oscar Wilde in front of the Prince of
  Wales: “Your majesty is like a stream of bat’s piss.” “What?” he exclaims. “I
  merely meant, your majesty, that you shine out like a shaft of gold whilst all
  around is dark.” We probably don’t need more bat piss but we (as in the world)
  have had enough dark. Whether it’s cricket or the Lionesses or Victoria
  Mboko’s tennis, we should all delight in the things that give us pleasure and
  help us avoid a doom scroll of news. (Also worth listening to the cheese shop
  sketch on the same album, when it all gets too much.) James Kydd London • Have
