  Downing Street has urged people not to take part in a protest in support of
  the banned group Palestine Action as police warned they would arrest anyone
  breaking terrorism laws. Palestine Action has been banned under terrorism
  laws, and this weekend a large event protesting against its proscription has
  been organised by the group Defend Our Juries. Asked if the government would
  encourage people not to attend the protest, Keir Starmer’s official
  spokesperson said: “Any action that is in support of a proscribed group in the
  UK, of course we do not support and the court has confirmed their continued
  proscription status.” The spokesperson added: “The home secretary previously
  said that those who seek to support this group may yet not know the true
  nature of this organisation, but people should be under no illusion this is
  not a peaceful or non-violent protest group.” Defend Our Juries is asking
  those taking part to to hold up signs saying “I Oppose Genocide, I Support
  Palestine Action,” which have resulted in the police making arrests at other
  events. The group plans to make a decision on Tuesday on whether it will
  proceed with the action but it is confident that more than 500 people are
  committed to taking part. However, a source with knowledge of the police’s
  early planning for this Saturday’s event said: “If they think that by turning
  up with significant numbers that we can’t arrest them for breaking terrorism
  laws, they need to think again. “They will be arrested. However we have to do
  it, they will be arrested for breaking terrorism laws.” The Met is aware of
  Saturday’s planned protest and is sceptical of claims that thousands of people
  could turn up. The force believes that a total in the low hundreds is more
  likely. Anyone arrested risks a terrorism conviction. At other events that led
  to mass arrests, the Met has arrested people, confirmed their identities and
  home addresses and then quickly released them on bail so they could be dealt
  with later. That tactic was used for an anti-immigration protest in Whitehall
  last summer and for past Extinction Rebellion protests at which scores of
  people were arrested. Police resources will be stretched at the weekend as a
  large, separate pro-Palestinian march is also scheduled for Saturday and
  anti-immigration protests are also expected. A spokesperson for Defend Our
  Juries denied any plot to overwhelm the police and the courts system, as was
  reported in the Telegraph on Monday. The campaign was not organised by
  Palestine Action, the spokesperson said, adding that a briefing document was
  available openly on the Defend Our Juries website. “It’s great the Telegraph
  is helping us to spread the word but there are serious inaccuracies in their
  story. We are not the ones planning to ‘overwhelm’ the system. If the Met
  exercises common sense and discretion and upholds its obligation to uphold the
  right of people to exercise their rights then nothing is being overwhelmed,”
  they added. “It is a difficult position for Sir Mark Rowley [the Metropolitan
  police commissioner] to be in. Based on what has happened on previous
  occasions it would be surprising if no one is arrested but on the other [hand]
  everyone is going to be doing the same thing and it will be a challenge to
  arrest more than 500 people given that we think there are about 520 available
  police cells in London at any one time,” they added. They believed Rowley
  would also be factoring in last week’s high court ruling giving permission to
  the co-founder of Palestine Action to bring a legal challenge to the home
  secretary’s decision to ban the group. “On top of the immense costs of this
  operation and shifting police from around the country then you have the
  prospect of hundreds and hundreds of payouts that the Met would have to make
  if the ban is deemed illegal, and we believe that will happen even if it means
  going all the way to Europe.” Other forces had exercised discretion not to
  arrest people at similar protests in Derry, Edinburgh and elsewhere, they
  added. The protests would take place regularly in future, they said, adding
  that it was becoming “a badge of honour” to be arrested. Defend Our Juries has
  had discussions with MPs about taking part but there was a reluctance on the
  basis of concerns it could lead to suspension from parliament. The Met’s plans
  will evolve throughout the week, and police chiefs will consider whether the
  force – Britain’s largest – may need to call on mutual aid from others to
  manage. The Met faces dangers from both sides of the debate. Supporters of
  Palestine Action may accuse police of being heavy-handed if they make mass
  arrests, while those on the right may accuse the Met of going soft if people
  openly break terrorism laws and are not arrested.
