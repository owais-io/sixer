  The independent MP Rupert Lowe has agreed to donate £1,000 to a charity after
  mistaking its rowing crew, including a former Royal Marine, for possible
  “illegal migrants”. Lowe, who was elected as a Reform MP for Great Yarmouth
  but now sits as an independent, said he had shopped the crew to the
  authorities and vowed to do everything he could to have them deported if they
  turned out to be what he suspected Instead, he was accused of being part of a
  vigilante effort after it turned out they were the four-person crew of an
  ocean rowing boat who were off Great Yarmouth as they attempted to row from
  Land’s End to John o’Groats to raise funding and awareness for motor neurone
  disease (MND). Lowe, who has claimed he was ousted from Reform in March
  because the party’s leader, Nigel Farage, feared he was becoming too
  influential, posted a picture on social media on Thursday evening showing the
  boat near wind turbines off the Norfolk coast. “Dinghies coming into Great
  Yarmouth, RIGHT NOW. Authorities alerted, and I am urgently chasing. If these
  are illegal migrants, I will be using every tool at my disposal to ensure
  these individuals are deported,” he wrote. He also demanded mass deportations.
  The crew – Matthew Parker, Mike Bates, Aaron Kneebone and Liz Wardley, known
  collectively as Row4MND – said they had been contacted by the coastguard and
  asked if they could see a dinghy nearby. Bates, a Royal Navy veteran and
  British record holder for rowing solo across the Atlantic, said it soon became
  clear the coastguard was asking about his own boat. “I looked to my right and
  there was maybe a dozen individuals stood on the shoreline staring at us.”
  After satisfying the coastguard they were who they said they were, they
  continued. Several hours later, however, the coastguard contacted them again
  because the police had “asked if they could send a lifeboat out to check who
  we were”. A friend eventually forwarded Lowe’s post to the crew, which Bates
  said had provided a moment of light relief. “We found it hilarious,” he said.
  “I’ve not been mistaken for a migrant before. The best comment was the one
  asking where the Royal Navy were when you need them. I’m a former Royal
  Marine, so the Royal Navy were on the boat. “But it was almost like a
  vigilante-style, people following us down the beach. They hadn’t twigged that
  we were parallel to the shore for hours and not trying to land.” Lowe later
  posted on social media: “Good news. False alarm! The unknown vessel was
  charity rowers, thank goodness. As a well done to the crew, I’ll donate £1,000
  to their charity – raising money for MND. Keep going, and watch out for any
  real illegal migrants! “We received a huge number of urgent complaints from
  constituents. I make no apologies over being vigilant for my constituents. It
  is a national crisis. No mass deportations for the charity rowers, but we
  definitely need it for the illegal migrants!” The crew set off from Land’s End
  heading for the Irish Sea, but bad weather forced them to turn back, so they
  headed in the opposite direction instead. They intend to row the return
  journey next year, from California to Hawaii in 2027 and New York to London in
  2028, with a target of raising £57m.
