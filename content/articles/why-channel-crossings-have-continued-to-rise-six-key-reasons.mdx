  Keir Starmer moved into Downing Street 403 days ago promising to ditch the
  government’s failing Rwanda plan, bin the slogan “stop the boats” and instead
  use the money to “smash the gangs” organising the crossings. Since then, more
  than 50,000 people have arrived in the UK after travelling across the Channel
  in ribbed boats, and the smuggling gangs continue to profit from the misery of
  desperate people. Reform UK’s popularity is soaring amid campaigns for the
  closure of hotels being used to house asylum seekers as claimants wait to
  discover if they can live and work in the UK. Here are six reasons that the
  number of Channel crossings have continued to rise. People seeking refuge
  People are trying to escape rapid climate change, famine, oppressive
  governments and war across Africa, Asia and the Middle East. In 2024, nearly
  half of those arriving in small boats were from Afghanistan, Syria and Iran,
  where there have been food shortages, a savage civil war, and campaigns to
  oppress women and minorities, respectively. In the first three months of this
  year, people coming from Eritrea made up 20% of new arrivals for the first
  time. The Eritrean government has been accused of widespread human rights
  abuses while a famine exacerbated by drought threatens 1 million Eritreans –
  approximately 20% of the population – according to the World Food Programme.
  They come to the UK despite the Channel becoming an increasingly dangerous
  route. In 2024, the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM)
  Missing Migrants Project recorded the highest number of deaths and missing
  persons in the Channel, with 82 people losing their lives, at least 14 of whom
  were children. Ties to the UK Many refugees and economic migrants are drawn to
  the UK because of family and historical ties, making it easier to settle in
  the country and understand its institutions. English continues to be the
  official language across large swathes of Africa and Asia. There are also
  perceptions that the UK is a safer and more welcoming country for minorities
  compared with many other countries in continental Europe. Lack of safe and
  legal routes People seeking asylum in the UK must usually arrive on British
  shores to apply for refuge. Most people are not eligible to apply for asylum
  from their home countries. Unless they are applying through one of a small
  number of restricted routes, applicants must be present in the UK to make a
  claim. Refugee charities have called for new safe and legal routes to be
  opened for applicants, so they do not have to get into overcrowded boats run
  by smuggling gangs. The UK governments under Labour and the Tories have
  declined to do so, usually because of the concern that the country will be
  overwhelmed and it could act as a “pull factor”. Security clampdowns The
  successful enforcement of other unauthorised modes of entry, such as in the
  back of lorries and on the Eurotunnel, has contributed to the number of people
  attempting to cross in boats, according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. After
  2014, the British and French governments invested in enhanced security in and
  around French ports and the Eurotunnel. These enhanced security measures –
  including more perimeter fencing, additional CCTV, increased patrols, CO2
  detectors, thermal imaging, and heartbeat monitors – meant that people
  attempting to reach the UK found it harder to sneak into the country by other
  means. Smuggling boat gangs have stepped in to meet the demand and have become
  larger and increasingly professionalised. Prices for journeys have fallen from
  about €14,000 in 2018 to under €4,000 in 2024, while the numbers on each boat
  have increased to more than 60. Policy lag Starmer’s plans to smash the gangs
  have not yet had time to take effect. The prime minister has introduced a
  number of measures that are expected to cut the smuggling gangs’ operations,
  but they will take time, ministers have said. These include a “one in, one
  out” policy announced last week, which will mean that for every migrant
  returned to France after crossing the Channel in a small boat, the UK will
  allow one asylum seeker to enter through a safe and legal route. Other
  measures include powers to trace suspects and freeze assets of smugglers, and
  an increase in the number of specialist investigators. The border security,
  asylum and immigration bill, which will bring in counter-terror-style powers
  to help identify and disrupt smuggling gangs, has not yet been passed. Weather
  There were an unusually high number of days with calm and warm weather at the
  start of this year, government sources said, which also contributed to the
  high number of crossings.
