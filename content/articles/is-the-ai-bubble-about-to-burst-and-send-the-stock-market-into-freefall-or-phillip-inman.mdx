  There are growing fears of an imminent stock market crash – one that will
  transform from a dip to a dive when euphoric headlines about the wonders of
  artificial intelligence begin to wane. Shares in US tech stocks have fallen in
  recent weeks and the prospect is that a flood of negative numbers will become
  the norm before the month is out. It could be 2000 all over again, and just
  like the bursting of the dotcom bubble it may be ugly, with investors junking
  businesses that once looked good on paper but now resemble a huge liability.
  Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, is one of the policymakers tasked
  with keeping the wolf from the door. Speaking on Friday at the annual Jackson
  Hole gathering of central bank governors in Wyoming, he tried to calm nerves.
  He said the Fed was concerned about rising inflation, while at the same time
  willing to help an economy dogged by uncertainty induced by Donald Trump and a
  global economic slowdown. With stagflation a genuine prospect – as the US
  economy slows and inflation remains high – Powell gave stock markets a sign
  that interest rates will fall, easing the pressure on indebted companies.
  Stock markets are on Powell’s radar even more than usual now that so many
  personal pensions in the US are directly invested in listed companies. And,
  more particularly, tech stocks making huge AI investments that have yet to
  make a dollar of profit. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology report
  revealed that 95% of companies investing in generative AI have yet to see any
  financial returns. This revelation came after Sam Altman, the boss of the
  ChatGPT owner OpenAI, warned that some company valuations were “insane”. Ipek
  Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at the currency trading firm Swissquote, said:
  “The [Altman] comments may have been a wake-up call for investors, sparking a
  sharp pullback in high-flying names.” At the beginning of the week, the share
  price of the data mining and spyware firm Palantir, which has billions of
  dollars worth of US government contracts, plunged almost 10%. The AI chip
  maker Nvidia fell more than 3%, while other AI-linked stocks such as Arm,
  Oracle and AMD also lost ground. Most pension funds will be invested in these
  tech companies, alongside more longstanding names such as Amazon, Microsoft,
  Alphabet (Google) and Meta (Facebook). Should fund managers pull out? That
  would probably be unwise. The scale of investment in AI by the likes of Google
  and Meta is vast and while the technology’s potential is the subject of much
  speculation, white-collar workers are becoming more familiar with the supposed
  benefits with every passing day. Corporate messages asking them to use AI for
  presentations, report writing and research are a daily occurrence
  (accompanied, of course, with hollow assurances that job cuts are not being
  considered). Microsoft’s Copilot and the many other “helpful” AI tools on
  offer are becoming embedded in office life and beginning to perform large
  numbers of low-level tasks. If this trend takes off, and in many parts of the
  economy it already has, there is a soft landing waiting for the tech industry
  even as some of the flakier, more speculative businesses are weeded out and
  fail. If anything, a downturn helps the big firms pick up new technological
  breakthroughs from the wreckage and on the cheap. Palantir’s price-to-earnings
  ratio is north of 500 when most investors would find themselves getting
  panicky at anything above 50. Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio of 56. The
  Palantir/Nvidia ratios could decline as their share price falls more into line
  with a reasonable prospect of likely earnings, but the businesses are not
  going to go bust, even in the most severe equity market storms. Trump is
  another significant supporter, clearing the path for AI to make even deeper
  inroads into corporate life. His support for cryptocurrencies, including his
  own, and deregulated social media platforms, including his own, are
  indications of where his sympathies lie. AI is probably going to be bad for
  humanity, given that politicians and regulators are light years behind the
  tycoons and tech magnates backing AI, many of whom see it as a new way to
  disempower and dominate workers. However, as an investor, AI isn’t going away,
  crash or no crash.
