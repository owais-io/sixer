  A bearded expert and a group of Ukrainian soldiers arrived in the village of
  Slovianka on a special mission. Their goal did not involve shooting at
  invading Russian forces. Instead, they had come to rescue a unique piece of
  history before it could be swallowed up by war and a frontline creeping
  closer. The soldiers placed a giant object on a wooden pallet. It was a carved
  stone figure created about 800 years ago. The sculpture – of a woman holding a
  ceremonial pot, wearing a necklace and with tiny legs – was lifted gently on
  to a flatbed truck. “We didn’t think we would have to evacuate it. But we do.
  It’s sad,” Yurii Fanyhin, who coordinated the operation, explained. Today
  Slovianka is a small farmland community, not far from the administrative
  border between Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk oblasts. Between the 11th and 13th
  centuries, however, it was at the centre of a vast steppe route. A Turkic
  nomadic people – known as the Cumans or Polovtsy – flourished here, north of
  the Black Sea. They were formidable and skilled warriors. Their world survives
  in the form of elaborate funerary statues known as babas, which once littered
  the landscape of southern Ukraine. Each represents a dead individual. There
  are fighters depicted with weapons, helmets and belts. And – unusually for the
  early medieval period – there are many women. Some wear jewellery; one is
  pregnant; all have hair hidden under a hat. In spring 2024, Fanyhin and his
  soldier-volunteers travelled to the under-fire city of Velyka Novosilka, now
  under Russian occupation. They retrieved a sculpture hit by shrapnel. Other
  figures standing on a hill were damaged when the Russians seized the
  north-eastern city of Izium. So far the team has rescued 11 babas. They have
  been transported west to Dnipro’s national history museum. The museum has more
  than 100 Polovtsian sculptures. It is the world’s biggest collection. Some are
  in good condition. Others – after centuries of rain and snow – have lost many
  of their features, their smooth heads and torsos reminiscent of abstract works
  by the 20th-century sculptor Henry Moore. The outside pavilion where they are
  kept recently lost some of its glass when a Russian missile landed nearby. The
  museum’s director, Oleksandr Starik, said he was hopeful the British Museum or
  another international institution could help conserve and restore the statues.
  At a time of conflict, there was little Ukrainian government funding available
  for culture, he acknowledged. The babas were not only sacred national heritage
  but disproved the claim that Ukraine did not exist and was a part of
  “historical” Russia, he said. In 2022, Vladimir Putin used this false idea to
  justify his invasion. “It’s important for Russia to show that only Slavs lived
  on this territory and no one else. In fact, the steppe was mixed. There were
  many different ethnicities,” Starik said. “Our task is to show that it’s our
  ancestors who lived there. They were nomads who moved all the time and were
  not connected with the Russian imperium.” The Cumans placed their statues on
  mounds, as close to the heavens as possible. According to Starik, the figures
  showed the boundaries of different tribes and were used as easy-to-spot steppe
  markers. The figures were seen as alive, and as a way of communicating with
  ancestors, in accordance with shamanist religious traditions. Sacrifices were
  carried out at the sites, Starik suggested. Of Putin’s attempted conquest of
  Ukraine, he said: “It’s colonial politics. The empire doesn’t work unless you
  seize new territory.” He continued: “It was important for us to save the
  statues. The enemy doesn’t care about them. The Russians are completely
  indifferent to the past. They keep smashing up our monuments using artillery
  and bombs.” Two of the babas were retrieved from the town of Mezhova, now only
  15km (9 miles) from the frontline, on the eastern edge of Dnipropetrovsk
  oblast. Earlier this month a Russian drone blew up a civilian minibus and a
  glide bomb destroyed the town’s school. In 2014, statues were lost when Russia
  staged a covert part-takeover of the eastern Donbas region, seizing the cities
  of Donetsk and Luhansk and their museum artefacts. Yevhen Khrypun, the editor
  of the local Mezhivskyi Merydian newspaper, said the sculptures were
  fascinating because they were a concrete representation of a living person.
  “The idea that the Polovtsy are our ancestors is not very scientific, to be
  honest. Earlier we had Scythians, Sarmatians and Cimmerians. It’s more
  symbolic: these were all people who lived on our lands,” he said. Not everyone
  is happy to see the sculptures moved to safer areas. In one case, after a baba
  was removed, village authorities filed a report with the police. They alleged
  the sculpture had been stolen. The convoy heading back to Dnipro was stopped
  while officers checked documents. It was eventually left in a secure place. In
  another incident in Donetsk oblast there was a standoff. “The road was blocked
  with a tractor,” Fanyhin reported. In some situations the statues are
  impossible to retrieve. One is located outside the city of Kostyantynivka,
  besieged by Russia. First-person-view drones cruise its streets, targeting any
  vehicle that moves. “We need help from the military to get it out. But no one
  wants to risk their life for a statue. I don’t want to risk mine either,”
  Fanyhin said. The historian said the rescue missions had kept him sane, during
  a stressful period of war and loss. “In some way the babas saved us,” he said.
  “We feel we are doing an important and even a great thing. It shows that
  Ukraine doesn’t forget its cultural landmarks, even statues on the frontline.
  After our victory, they will be more valuable.”
