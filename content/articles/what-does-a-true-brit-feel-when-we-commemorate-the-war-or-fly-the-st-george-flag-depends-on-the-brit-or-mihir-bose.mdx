  Are we, to echo Keir Starmer’s now infamous phrase, “an island of strangers”?
  No. But there is a deep cultural divide in this country, a cultural dissonance
  we don’t discuss but should. Witness the row about the Wythall Flaggers, the
  group that has erected numerous St George’s flags in the Worcestershire
  village to parade its patriotism. What does it mean? Is it laudable patriotism
  or a nod to the hard-right, anti-migrant politics that is fast becoming
  mainstream? Is it inclusive or exclusive? “We have members of the community of
  all ethnicities and religions stopping by and praising what we are doing so
  please don’t call this racist,” say the organisers. Maybe that is so, but
  certainly different people will look at those flags and take different
  meanings from them, feel different emotions. That’s pretty much our island
  story now. We are the same, but we’re different. The VJ commemoration last
  week, led by King Charles, spoke to that. There was all the pomp and
  circumstance you might expect, but a few hours before Britain and others
  marked the victory over Japan at the National Memorial Arboretum in
  Staffordshire, there was, in Delhi’s historic Red Fort complex – and much
  noted in British/Indian households – a very different celebration to mark
  India’s 78th birthday as a free nation. There was no mention of the victory
  over Japan, or the tremendous part played by Indian soldiers in securing it.
  Instead, one of the heroes honoured was Subhas Chandra Bose (no relation), who
  created the Indian National Army (INA) from Indian soldiers taken prisoner by
  Japan, and fought against the British when Japan invaded northeast India in
  1944. The INA achieved little on the battlefield, but Indians see the INA as
  comparable with the American and Irish struggle to secure freedom from British
  rule. When the British court-martialled three of Bose’s officers after the war
  for forswearing their original allegiance and “waging war against His Majesty
  the King Emperor”, Indians – far from turning against them, and accepting the
  British depiction of them as “Japanese-inspired fifth columnists” – turned on
  the British. Their defence described them as patriots and converted the court
  martial into a Britain versus India battle. Even Gandhi, the great champion of
  non-violence, eulogised Bose, describing how “the hypnotism of the INA has
  cast its spell upon us … His patriotism is second to none”. Indians can be
  accused of ignoring the truth that Japan behaved with unprecedented cruelty,
  but many here can and will argue that Britain is also doctoring history when
  it claims, as during Friday’s celebration, that the war against Japan was a
  war for freedom. No mention there that Japan was attacking Britain’s Asian
  colonies and Britain had no intention of giving these Asians freedom. There’s
  also dissonance as we discuss immigration. The story now is that while Europe
  has always welcomed migration, it cannot cope with such vast numbers of
  uninvited guests. But that, too, raises eyebrows among various diaspora who
  call Britain home. That immigrants are coming in large numbers from lands this
  country has no connection with cannot be denied. But this picture of Europe
  traditionally welcoming migrants distorts the truth: while Europe has coped
  with internal migration from other European countries, and some former
  colonies, it has largely been a people-exporting continent. As the historian
  Alfred Crosby put it: “European migrants and their descendants are all over
  the place.” While non Europeans mostly live in their own continents, Europeans
  “have leapfrogged around the globe”. Migration has long gone both ways. We in
  the various diasporas know this. Between 1820 and 1930, more than 50 million
  Europeans leapfrogged so successfully from their continent that they created
  what Crosby calls Neo-Europes, “lands thousands of kilometres from Europe and
  from each other”. At the beginning of the 19th century, these lands were
  almost wholly non-white, but by the end the great majority of people were
  Europeans. In 1800, says Crosby, North America had fewer than 5 million white
  people, southern South America fewer than half a million, Australia had 10,000
  and New Zealand was still a Māori country. As a result of the wave of European
  migration in the next century, Crosby wrote, Australia’s population was almost
  all European in origin and that of New Zealand about nine-tenths European. We
  hear the debate about migration and raise an eyebrow. We know the context. In
  April 1990, the late Norman Tebbit waded into this very British dissonance
  with his cultural test, the “Tebbit test”, suggesting that immigrants who
  support their native countries rather than England in cricket are not
  significantly integrated into the UK. But that was always nonsense. We are one
  nation, but, apart from on very rare occasions, there are no UK cricket,
  football or rugby teams. The English don’t support Scotland, Wales or Northern
  Ireland, and their respective fans largely reciprocate. Many a Scot has been
  known to temporarily support whoever might humiliate England. Yet they all
  belong. In rugby and cricket there is one Irish team, with the Northern Irish
  playing alongside their southern neighbours. So we are not an island of
  strangers, but neither are we close to, or even seeking, cultural homogeneity.
  There are points of view and differing perceptions shaped by varying
  experiences and different shades of history, and frankly it’s all a bit of a
  hodgepodge. But then, families are like that. People will hold patriotic
  ceremonies, and fly patriotic flags, but all of it will always invite numerous
  interpretations, as does the idea of patriotism. You can worry about that if
  you like, but I think it’s all quite healthy. Mihir Bose is the author of
  Thank You Mr Crombie Lessons in Guilt and Gratitude to the British.
