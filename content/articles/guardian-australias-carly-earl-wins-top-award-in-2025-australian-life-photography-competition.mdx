  Guardian Australia’s picture editor, Carly Earl, has won the $10,000 top award
  in the 2025 Australian Life photography competition, with the judges praising
  Earl for capturing “a beautiful insight into reality of life in rural
  Australia” in her portrait of young drovers in central Queensland. Earl, a
  Sydney-based photographer and picture editor for Guardian Australia, took the
  portrait of 19-year-old Riley Swanson while covering a droving team working
  south of Roma in central Queensland. “Young drovers in rural Australia spend
  months on horseback moving cattle, far from modern distractions,” Earl wrote
  in her artist statement for the winning work. “Sleeping in trailers and riding
  12-hour days, they face isolation, injury risks and financial loss. Many quit
  early, but a few, like Riley Swanson, endure the harsh, romanticised life on
  remote, decades-old stock routes.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown
  of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning
  Australian Life, an annual competition and exhibition run by the City of
  Sydney council as part of their public art program Art and About, showcases
  works from amateur and professional photographers. Earl’s photograph, one of
  30 finalist images across different age categories, was awarded the top prize
  by judges Hank Paul, who won last year; photographer Milly Hooper; and
  documentary and travel photographer Matt Horspool. Hooper said Earl’s portrait
  offered “a beautiful insight into reality of life in rural Australia – an
  ordinary story that most city folk wouldn’t be aware of”, while Horspool
  praised her “use of shadows, colour and composition”. Earl’s win was announced
  at a ceremony at Sydney’s Customs House on Thursday night, along with the
  winners of Australian Life’s youth category, open to photographers aged 13 to
  17, and the Little Sydney Lives competition, open to photographers aged five
  to 12. Callum Poling won Australian Life’s teen category for his black and
  white photograph February Boat Carnival, showing the “organised chaos” of a
  surf boat carnival, while Chloe Wiseman won the Little Sydney Lives category
  with a black and white portrait of her mum titled Home-made Mummy
  Double-Exposure, using a double-exposure technique. Zoe Morris was named
  runner up with her ebullient photograph Sibling Love, capturing “the close
  bond between a brother and a sister”. The finalists from Australian Life will
  be showcased in an outdoor exhibition at Circular Quay, while the finalists
  for the Little Sydney Lives competition will be exhibited at Customs House
  nearby. The Australian Life and Little Sydney Lives exhibitions run until 24
  August, at Customs House Square and Customs House Library, respectively.
