  Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would ask Congress for “long-term” control
  of Washington DC’s police department and signaled he expected other
  Democratic-led cities to change their laws in response to his deployment of
  national guard troops and federal agents into the capital. The president’s
  comments came as the White House took credit for dozens of arrests overnight
  in Washington as part of Trump’s campaign to fight a “crime crisis”, which the
  city’s leaders say does not exist. Trump earlier this week invoked a
  never-before-used clause of the law that sets out the federal district’s
  governance structure to take temporary control of the police department, but
  will need Congress’s permission to extend it beyond the 30 days allowed under
  the statute. “We’re going to need a crime bill that we’re going to be putting
  in, and it’s going to pertain initially to DC,” Trump said during a visit to
  the Kennedy Center performing arts venue in Washington. “We’re going to use it
  as a very positive example, and we’re going to be asking for extensions on
  that, long-term extensions, because you can’t have 30 days.” He said he
  expected to propose the legislation “very quickly”, though the Senate and
  House of Representatives are out of session and not scheduled to return until
  2 September. Trump alluded to other options for extending control of the
  police department, saying “if it’s a national emergency, we can do it without
  Congress”. The president spoke after national guard troops appeared on the
  National Mall on Tuesday evening as officers from the FBI, Drug Enforcement
  Administration and Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies
  appeared in neighborhoods across the city. Video circulating on local media
  showed police and federal agents arresting at least one person that evening in
  Columbia Heights, home to the city’s largest Hispanic population. Other videos
  showed traffic stops near Kennedy Street in north-west Washington, which in
  years past has been the site of gang activity. The administration argues the
  steps are necessary to fight what Trump has called an “out of control” crime
  problem in the nation’s capital, but local officials have disputed that
  characterization. Data shows that crime rates plunged last year to the lowest
  levels in three decades, though the capital does have higher rates of some
  violent crimes compared with cities with similar populations. Trump ordered
  federal assets into the capital after a staffer with the so-called “department
  of government efficiency” was attacked early in the morning in an upscale
  entertainment district. A White House official credited Tuesday night’s
  deployment with a total of 43 arrests, twice the total of the previous
  evening. It was unclear how much more that was than a typical night. A
  spokesperson for the Metropolitan police department said a total of 76 arrests
  were made throughout the day citywide on Tuesday; the agency’s data showed
  they made an average of 56 arrests per day in 2024. More than 1,450 officers
  participated in the deployment, about half of whom were from the city’s police
  department, while only 30 national guard troops were deployed of the roughly
  800 whom defense officials have said are expected to arrive for the mission. A
  White House official said to expect a “significantly higher” presence of
  national guard troops over the days to come, as well as round-the-clock
  patrols by federal agents, which have thus far only been present in the
  evenings. Democratic lawmakers have condemned Trump’s incursion as an
  authoritarian move intended to distract his supporters from outrage over his
  refusal to make public files related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey
  Epstein, a one-time friend who has become a fixation of conspiracy theorists.
  Trump on Wednesday accused the Democrats of being “afraid to do anything
  because they don’t want to be criticized. But fighting crime is a good thing.”
  He warned that he would seek changes to Washington DC’s crime laws that he
  expected other cities to adopt, pointing to a cash-bail reform lawmakers in DC
  approved in 1992. “We’re going to go for statutes in DC and then ultimately
  for the rest of the country, where that’s not going to be allowed,” Trump
  said, singling out New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, all cities governed by
  Democrats. He also criticized the city government’s long-term push to be made
  a state, saying it was an attempt by Democrats to get two more senators.
  “Statehood is ridiculous. We want to straighten the place out,” Trump said.
  Washington DC is the second US city to which Trump has deployed troops since
  taking office in January. In June, he ordered US marines and federalized
  national guard troops into Los Angeles to quell protests over his immigration
  crackdown. Officials in the overwhelmingly Democratic city have chafed at
  Trump’s deployment, with the attorney general, Brian Schwalb, saying earlier
  this week that the government was “considering all of our options and will do
  what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents”. The
  Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, has sought a cordial relationship with Trump
  since his return to the White House, but changed her tone on Tuesday, urging
  residents and voters during a social media event “to protect our city, to
  protect our autonomy, to protect our home rule and get to the other side of
  this guy and make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop
  to this authoritarian push”. The White House said a total of 19 teams of
  officers from various federal agencies are in the city “to promote public
  safety and arrest violent offenders”, while the national guard will “protect
  federal assets, provide a safe environment for law enforcement officers to
  make arrests, and deter violent crime with a visible law enforcement
  presence”. On Tuesday night, arrests were made of people suspected of driving
  under the influence, unlawful entry and resisting arrest, and of an individual
  with an outstanding warrant for assault with a deadly weapon, the White House
  official said. Seven illegal firearms were also recovered. In an opinion piece
  published in the Washington Post, Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News personality
  recently confirmed as Washington DC’s US attorney, said she would push the
  city council to change laws around criminal sentencing, particularly for the
  juveniles she blamed for violence. “Young criminals have been emboldened to
  think they can get away with committing crime in this city, and, very often,
  they do. But together with our local and federal partners, our message to them
  today is: we will identify you, prosecute you and convict you,” Pirro said.
  The 700,000 residents of the federal district have no voting representation in
  Congress and the president and federal lawmakers have the power to meddle in
  laws passed by the city council.
