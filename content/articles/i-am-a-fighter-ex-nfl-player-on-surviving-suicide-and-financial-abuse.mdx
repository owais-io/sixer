  In a span of five years, beginning in 2015, the former National Football
  League quarterback Erik Kramer tried unsuccessfully to die by suicide, then
  lost hundreds of thousands of dollars after a woman he secretly married
  plundered his life’s earnings while he struggled to heal. Kramer nonetheless
  considers himself an “extremely lucky man” and knows his “recovery – both
  mental and physical – has been extraordinary by any definition”, he said in an
  essay shared with the Guardian. Wednesday marks the release of a new
  documentary podcast aimed at unpacking his remarkable ordeal. The Quarterback
  and the Con Artist revisits Kramer’s victimization at the hands of Courtney
  Baird and also revives questions about the toll taken on the bodies and minds
  of American football players. Those renewed questions come after a man who
  blamed football for giving him the incurable brain illness CTE fatally shot
  four people at the office tower which houses the NFL’s headquarters before
  killing himself on 28 July. “Do you blame CTE for what happened to your dad?”
  the podcast host, Johnathan Walton, asks Kramer’s son, Dillon, at one point
  during the 10-episode series. Watson alludes to neurological research
  establishing a link between the sport and the disease that can only be
  diagnosed posthumously. Dillon replies: “I definitely think CTE is the biggest
  contributor by far. I don’t think that he was aware of what was going on.”
  Kramer, 60, played QB in the NFL in 10 different seasons mostly from 1991 to
  1999 for the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears and what were then
  the San Diego Chargers. The Los Angeles native is perhaps best known for
  teaming with the hall of fame runner Barry Sanders to produce the Lions’ only
  playoff win from 1957 through 2023. And in 1995 he also set single-season
  records for most passing yards and passing touchdowns for the Bears.
  Throughout those exploits, Kramer suffered from depression. And his condition
  took a turn for the worse when his 18-year-old son, Griffen, who grappled with
  substance abuse, died unexpectedly in 2011. Things then darkened even more
  when – months later – Erik’s mother died from uterine cancer and his father
  was diagnosed with terminal, esophageal cancer. Kramer finally brought a gun
  to a southern California motel room and used it to shoot himself, thinking in
  his ill mind – as his essay put it – “all my problems would be over”.
  Miraculously, he survived and had enough money from his NFL career to pay for
  the medical treatment he subsequently required. The self-inflicted wound left
  him with the mental capacity “of a six-year-old boy”, he wrote. He added: “I
  could not process complex concepts or decisions.” It was then that Baird
  reinserted herself into his life after the two had previously dated and broken
  up. What started with borrowing Kramer’s credit card for grocery runs while
  purportedly presenting herself as “a doting caregiver” steadily escalated into
  taking up to $700 from him for herself daily, costing him as much as $15,000
  monthly, he wrote. Baird ultimately was brought to legal account after a
  childhood friend of Kramer’s became suspicious upon seeing packages from the
  online marketplace Amazon piling up outside his home. They were all addressed
  to Baird and paid for with Kramer’s credit cards. The friend, Anna Dergan,
  checked Baird’s bank records and noticed daily ATM withdrawals totaling
  thousands of dollars, excessive credit card transactions and cash advances and
  forged checks, according to Kramer. There was evidence Baird had even drained
  Griffen’s memorial account. As Dergan called for authorities to investigate
  Baird criminally, the latter arranged to marry Kramer in a courthouse ceremony
  to which none of his friends or family were invited. Kramer’s essay described
  that maneuver as a “checkmate move”, and the podcast explores how it hindered
  efforts to prosecute Baird for years. He eventually recovered to the point
  where he comprehended he needed to divorce Baird. Kramer says she alleged to
  authorities he had subjected her to domestic violence the same day he informed
  her of his desire to divorce, prompting news coverage about him that he
  condemns as “defamatory”. He has been fighting to correct the record ever
  since. Kramer finally succeeded in having Baird charged with a dozen felonies
  in 2020. She eventually pleaded guilty to theft, identity theft, forgery and
  dependent adult abuse – but only after Kramer was set back about $700,000.
  That figure also includes the court-related costs incurred as a result of his
  time with Baird and his push to get his marriage to her annulled. At an August
  2024 sentencing hearing, Baird, 52, only received six months in prison
  followed by probation, partly because she came up with $170,000 in cash as
  restitution for Kramer, he wrote in his essay. Kramer said he dedicates most
  of his days since having wrested himself “from the clutches of a conniving con
  artist” to giving talks to various groups about mental health and the warning
  signs of depression. He said he grasps that he defied grim odds, with
  self-inflicted gunshot wounds making up only 1% of attempted, not completed,
  suicide attempts. So he said he has chosen not to be bitter about – and
  instead derive inspiration from – the events recounted on The Quarterback and
  the Con Artist, which is available on all major podcast platforms. “All of
  this made me realize the truth. I am a fighter,” Kramer wrote. “I don’t stay
  down.” In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention
