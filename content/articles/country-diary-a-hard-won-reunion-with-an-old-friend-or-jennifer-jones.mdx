  Walking into Birkdale’s Green Beach on a grey but warm summer’s day felt like
  entering a Paul Klee painting. The profusion of colour, pattern and texture
  was overwhelming. Fleabane, evening primrose and meadowsweet tussled alongside
  red clover, common centaury and common restharrow. Peacock, gatekeeper and
  common blue butterflies pirouetted haphazardly. Walking on the Sefton coast, I
  headed south towards Ainsdale. I was on a quest. Slacks, those areas closer to
  the water table, were my target habitat. Plants there require more water than
  in the arid conditions of the coastal dunes. My quarry was grass of Parnassus
  – not a nationally rare flower, but one that, especially in this location, has
  a lot of resonance for me. The name is a misnomer if ever there was one. Grass
  of Parnassus is not a grass, nor is it confined to Mount Parnassus. I first
  met it in the final year of my undergraduate studies when I was investigating
  soil formation on this very coast. I have never forgotten its beauty. Today,
  grasshoppers pogoed along the path, dragonfly minicopters darted and bramble
  grabbed my feet. Walking through sand tested muscles. Progress was slow.
  Several slacks were visited, rich in flora, but no grass of Parnassus. Hot,
  tired and despondent, I thought my efforts were in vain. I’d have to make the
  30-mile journey again the following day. I decided to take the detour, one
  last try, along a path that led to the sea. Suddenly, near the slack margins,
  a vision, a celestial array! The impact was visceral; I even exclaimed aloud.
  Before me lay a wealth of grass of Parnassus, flower heads trembling in the
  breeze, a cohort of giggling dancers. They were more beautiful than I
  remembered. I was compelled to sit among them, to become their neighbour, past
  and present merging. The flowers themselves have five ivory petals, etched
  with green veins, with a lone leaf at their base. The main companion for these
  ones was creeping willow, just as it had been all those decades ago. Recent
  dry conditions had robbed them of the damp conditions they need, yet still
  they gleamed. Drought is the enemy of this plant; I can only hope that climate
  change doesn’t deny its existence. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the
