  celebrate it

  We’re a week into the school summer holidays here in England, and I wonder how
  many parents who started out determined to keep their children completely away
  from screens are now beginning to feel the strain. When my sons were much
  younger, I often had these idyllic images in my head of day trips to the
  seaside, back garden treasure hunts, paddling in the river, visiting relatives
  … an endless series of character forming experiences which I imagined in
  grainy Kodachrome colours. Then I’d be faced with the reality of having a job,
  and also the, let’s say, limited attention span of my sons. Those boys could
  rocket through a host of formative activities in a few hours leaving a trail
  of muddy boots, half-finished crafting projects and tired grandparents in
  their wake. Sheepishly, we’d end up allowing some Fortnite time to catch our
  breath. There is so much pressure and guilt around children and gaming,
  especially during long school breaks, and I think we need to seriously redress
  our outlook as a society. I harbour many lovely memories of gaming with my
  sons during hot August days; drowsily loafing about building ridiculous
  mansions in Minecraft or laughing ourselves stupid in Goat Simulator. We would
  always take the Switch on holiday with us, so that in the evenings, when we
  went out for meals, there would be an hour or so where my wife and I could
  linger over a glass of wine, while the boys silently played Super Mario
  together. We still managed to build sand castles, go swimming and explore
  unfamiliar towns, but games provided a way to wind down and enjoy something
  familiar. When they stayed with their grandparents during holidays, they took
  games along too. My mum had a Nintendo Wii, which she claimed was exclusively
  for entertaining her grandchildren when she got tired; it was nice to watch my
  sons sit and patiently explain Kirby’s Epic Yarn to her. I expect it reminds
  her of when I was young, playing Commodore 64 games on our computer desk in
  the kitchen – trying to recruit my dad into sessions of footie game Kick Off
  or the golf sim Leaderboard while he was supposed to be cooking a chicken.
  It’s good for children to be able to share their expertise and enthusiasm,
  whether that’s about playing a guitar (which my kids did, after learning about
  the instrument via Rock Band and Guitar Hero) or capturing a Jigglypuff in
  Pokémon Go. It’s a cliche to say “all things in moderation”, but it also
  happens to be true. There is too much talk of screen time as some sort of
  all-pervading, homogeneous evil, when really we should be thinking about the
  quality of that screen time. When children grow up playing video games and
  they’re comfortable in that world, over the summer is a good time to think
  about what they’re playing, what they get out of it and who they’re playing
  with. Is it bad that they spend an hour or two every night in Fortnite? Or are
  they meeting friends, having a laugh and even building stuff in the Creative
  mode? Games are also wonderfully adaptable to different situations. You might
  not want them playing video games on the beach, but in those interstitial
  moments – a long journey, a rainy afternoon – they can be invaluable – and
  parents shouldn’t feel bad about that. For a lot of gen Z and gen alpha, games
  are a part of the texture of their lives now – they fit in, like reading a
  comic or listening to an album on a Walkman did when I was their age. Earlier
  this week, I took one of my sons, now 17, to London. I met a friend while he
  went off and explored the city by himself. On the coach on the way home to
  Somerset, we were a bit too knackered to chat, but instead we played Mario
  Kart World together. We stood the console on the little seat tray in front of
  me, but it kept juddering and moving as the coach drove along, usually to my
  advantage. It was funny; we laughed and compared tactics and occasionally
  looked up as the evening sun made the fields outside glow. I think I will
  remember that hour and a half I spent with him on the bus longer than anything
  else I did that day. There may have been a screen between us, but we were
  together. What to play Car battle games were wildly popular in the mid-1990s
  when titles such as Twisted Metal, Carmageddon and Destruction Derby
  encouraged players to smash their cars into other cars, repeatedly, often
  while also firing rocket launchers. Newcomer Fumes is looking to bring those
  heady days back – it’s an open-world single-player vehicle blast-’em-up where
  you explore a vast Mad Max landscape in an upgradeable muscle car destroying
  enemies. The slightly retro visuals and wailing guitar music hark back to the
  original PlayStation era and the arcade-style handling is loose and reckless.
  It’s in early access on Steam with a free demo available. Available on: PC
  Estimated playtime: 10 hours-plus What to read As reported in IGN as well as
  other sources, Sony is suing the Chinese game publisher Tencent for copyright
  and trademark infringement. The allegation is that Tencent’s forthcoming game
  Light of Motiram, in which a young girl battles giant robot dinosaurs in a
  vast open world, bears more than a passing resemblance to Sony’s hugely
  successful Horizon series, in which a young girl battles giant robot dinosaurs
  in a vast open world. Tencent has not yet commented on the allegations.
  Variety has revealed that a Wolfenstein TV series is in development at Amazon
  MGM Studios. Patrick Somerville (known for Station Eleven and Maniac) is set
  to write, while Jerk Gustafsson from game developer MachineGames will be an
  executive producer. The Nazi-slaughtering shooter is the latest video game,
  following the likes of The Last of Us and Fallout, to catch the interest of
  streaming TV platforms and film studios, looking to capture the attention of
  younger audiences who are tired of superheroes. Developers at Falmouth
  University are working with local teenagers to create a video game that helps
  young people deal with adverse childhood experiences. Entitled Ace of Hearts,
  it deals with subjects such as bereavement and poverty, and is designed to get
  players to talk about their experiences. Read more on the BBC news site. What

  communities focused on particular games, especially space exploration sims

  and explore their identities. For many young people, I genuinely think the
  modern world would be almost impossible to navigate without these spaces. If
