  The housing problem in the UK has become so pervasive that it can sometimes
  seem natural and eternal, the ever-present background to British life. But
  it’s important to remember that specific political projects and policy choices
  brought about the housing crisis – and continue to maintain it. A new report
  from the thinktank Common Wealth tallies up some of the continuing costs of
  one of the culprits: the right to buy, Margaret Thatcher’s signature social
  policy. It demonstrates that the right to buy has amounted to a massive
  giveaway of public resources, and one of the largest privatisations in British
  history. Focused on England, the report’s figures show the enormous scale of
  the public assets that local government was forced to give away. Since the
  policy’s introduction in 1980, 1.9m English council homes were sold at an
  average discount of 44% of market value. Common Wealth calculates that the
  discount resulted in councils giving up £194bn in equity. More than 40% of the
  homes sold under the right to buy are now privately rented. The history of the
  right to buy illuminates the political logic underlying it. Thatcher didn’t
  invent the idea – councils had been able to sell the public housing they owned
  to their tenants on a discretionary basis since 1936. But it was the Thatcher
  government that made it central to its strategy and brand. The 1980 Housing
  Act systematised and expanded the existing procedures for selling council
  houses to tenants. It obliged councils to allow discounted sales and required
  them to offer deposit-free mortgages to facilitate these sales. Local
  authorities were allowed to keep half of the proceeds from right-to-buy sales
  but were in effect prevented from spending it on replacing lost public
  housing. The right to buy managed at once to satisfy a number of rightwing
  political constituencies. Traditional conservatives favoured it as a way to
  expand owner-occupation. Neoliberals saw it as an opportunity to foster the
  entrepreneurial spirit and push back against municipal socialism. Above all,
  the right to buy was intended to encapsulate the Tory ideal of a
  property-owning democracy, which dated from the 1920s but featured prominently
  in the 1979 Conservative manifesto. There’s no question that many households
  benefited from the policy, which remains broadly popular. But uptake has been
  very uneven, disproportionately benefiting more affluent tenants living in
  more valuable locations and housing types. More serious has been the impact of
  the right to buy on the housing system as a whole. Its goal was to undermine
  public housing and lessen its role in British life. And in this, it has
  unfortunately been successful. The policy drove a structural shift in British
  housing tenure. Before the policy was enacted, social housing of all types
  made up 31% of overall housing tenure in England. Today it is 16%. As a
  result, council housing waiting lists and homelessness have surged. In
  addition to its impact on existing housing, the right to buy also made
  building new council housing less viable. As one council officer put it: “It
  makes us all more cautious about growing our stock.” If councils must sell at
  a discount any social housing units they build, then doing so becomes a risky
  venture. Rules about spending right-to-buy proceeds have been tweaked, but
  they still restrict the construction of new public housing. One council has
  calculated that it would need to sell six homes through the right to buy to
  generate enough funding to build one new home. The policy amounts to, in the
  report’s words, a “decision to de facto ban new social housebuilding”. To be
  sure, the issue is not just the right to buy, but the whole suite of housing
  policies that accompanied it. This included the deregulation of housing
  finance, the creation of the buy-to-let mortgage market and other support for
  landlordism and private home ownership. Through stock transfers, estate
  regeneration and other mechanisms, this housing policy trajectory has been
  upheld by Labour governments as well as the Tories. But the right to buy set
  the initial direction. In addition to its quantitative impacts, the policy had
  long-lasting ideological and political effects. For one, it strengthened the
  ideology of home ownership. It equated owner-occupation with independence,
  ambition and success while stigmatising and denigrating households that did
  not own property. Just as significantly, it helped sever the link between
  housing and social citizenship. The British state never fully
  institutionalised a right to housing, but for a few decades in the 20th
  century, public housebuilding was a sign of successful governance for both
  major parties. Today, it is clear that the property-owning democracy was a
  mirage. Social housing and owner-occupation are on the backfoot. Private
  landlordism and elite multiple property ownership are expanding. Rents and
  house prices are rising. The result is a housing crisis, precarity and
  inequality. Thatcher’s motto that “there is no alternative” was never an
  empirical claim so much as a normative ambition. The right to buy has been an
  exercise in trying to make this ambition a reality in the housing sphere, by
  eliminating existing alternatives to the private housing market. Critics have
  been calling for the policy’s abolition since it was introduced. The policy
  was already scrapped in 2016 in Scotland and 2019 in Wales. Shelter estimates
  that fully suspending the right to buy would save on average more than 10,000
  social homes a year. If the right to buy council housing were to be
  eliminated, a social tenants’ deposit scheme or other offsetting policies
  could be established to compensate tenants without undercutting social housing
  as a whole. If Britain’s housing problem is ever going to be solved, it will
  require fully ending the right to buy. But that alone is insufficient. The way
  out of the housing impasse is by privileging occupancy over property rights,
  flattening the tenure hierarchy, expanding social housing and building other
  decommodified housing alternatives. Resolving the housing crisis depends upon
  reversing and replacing the changes to the British housing system and society
  that the right to buy helped to bring about. David Madden is associate
