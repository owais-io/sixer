  The front page of Saturday’s Guardian print edition demonstrated both sides of
  the genocide in Gaza. The main image showed two western politicians, who could
  influence their leaders to stop Israel attacking innocent Palestinian people,
  laughing while they fished for the assembled media cameras, and the main
  headline was about the planned takeover of Gaza City by the Israeli government
  (Future of 1m Palestinians now hangs in the balance, 9 August). That will no
  doubt result in more killing and the likely forced relocation of people from
  their land – a war crime. History will record both men’s participation in this
  man-made human disaster by the Israeli government, but will either of them
  actually care? I don’t think so. Stuart Finegan Lewes, East Sussex • I can see
  it now, the BBC blurb for its new programme – Lammy &amp; Vance: Gone Fishing.
  Wonder at the beautiful Cotswolds countryside while the boys jest about
  “bring[ing] greater peace” to the world (US and UK disagree about Gaza policy,
  Vance suggests before Lammy meeting, 8 August). Laugh out loud as JD and Dave
  spend hours fishing for fun, while wars rage, children are starved and their
  governments do nothing. When you hear their joke about old people behaving
  like placard-bearing terrorists, you’ll be hooked. Bernie Evans Liverpool •
  Marina Hyde wondered if the foreign secretary and his vice-presidential house
  guest might go to Chevening’s ancient parish church of St Botolph on Sunday
  (What could the Cotswolds possibly offer JD Vance? I suggest a swim in one of
  its rivers, 8 August). If they made it, they perhaps heard the Book of Common
  Prayer readings for that Sunday, the Eighth after Trinity, which include these
  words of Jesus: “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s
  clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their
  fruits” (Matthew 7:15). Rev Robert Titley London • Have an opinion on anything
