  Prince Harry is considering establishing a new charity after a dispute that
  led to him leaving Sentebale, a spokesperson has said. It comes after the Duke
  of Sussex was criticised by the Charity Commission for allowing a row with the
  chair of Sentebale, which he co-founded in 2006, to “play out publicly”. The
  row involved Harry stepping down as patron in March in support of trustees who
  resigned in opposition to the board’s chair, Dr Sophie Chandauka, who had
  previously accused him of bullying and harassment. The charity works in
  Botswana and Lesotho supporting the health and wellbeing of young people,
  especially those with HIV and Aids. Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, who co-founded
  Sentebale alongside Harry in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales, also stepped
  down as patron. It has been suggested by allies close to Harry that he is keen
  to “continue to support the children of Lesotho and Botswana” and that he is
  examining his options over the nature of that support. A source close to the
  prince told the Telegraph: “He may well choose to just support existing
  charities operating in the same space in the region or he may choose to set up
  something new completely.” On Sunday, Harry’s official spokesperson said the
  prince remained “absolutely committed to continuing the work he started,
  supporting the children and young people of Lesotho and Botswana, nearly 20
  years ago”. The spokesperson added: “In what form that support takes – no
  decisions have been made. All options remain on the table; whether that be
  starting a new charity or working to support pre-existing charities operating
  in the same sector in the region.” Earlier this week, a source said the row
  had been “emotionally absolutely devastating” for the prince, and described
  Chandauka’s comments as “nothing short of a hostile takeover”. The Charity
  Commission, which cannot investigate individual allegations of bullying, said
  it found no evidence of systemic bullying or harassment at the charity,
  including misogyny or misogynoir, but acknowledged “the strong perception of
  ill treatment” felt by some involved. The trustees who resigned said in a
  statement they were “gravely concerned for the future of the charity” as they
  felt the regulator had “chosen to ignore key concerns and irrefutable evidence
  raised with them regarding the leadership and oversight of Sentebale’s chair”.
  In response to the findings, Sentebale said in a statement: “The Charity
  Commission is explicitly clear, including in its public guidance, that it is
  not the commission’s responsibility to adjudicate or mediate internal
  disputes. This would include individual allegations of bullying, harassment,
  misogyny, misogynoir etc. “As a result, the commission has not investigated
  any individual allegations and therefore has not made any findings in relation
  to individuals, including Prince Harry.”
