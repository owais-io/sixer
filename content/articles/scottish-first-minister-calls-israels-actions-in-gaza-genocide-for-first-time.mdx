  John Swinney has described for the first time Israel’s actions in Gaza as a
  “genocide”, with the Scottish first minister saying it was indisputable.
  Swinney became the second leader of a UK nation to use the term “genocide” in
  relation to the attacks by the Israel Defense Forces on Palestinians in Gaza
  after Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill did so last month. He was speaking at an
  Edinburgh fringe event in the Scottish capital, which was disrupted numerous
  times by pro-Palestinian protesters. Speaking to journalists after the event
  at the Strand Comedy Club, he said: “It’s quite clear that there is a genocide
  in Palestine – it can’t be disputed. “I have seen reports of terrible
  atrocities which have the character of being genocide. I’ve expressed that and
  obviously it’s not reached all those individuals, but that’s my feeling.”
  Israel has repeatedly denied it is carrying out a genocide and says the war in
  Gaza is one of self-defence after attacks by Hamas in Israel on 7 October 2023
  that killed 1,200 people, the majority civilians. More than 250 other people
  were kidnapped and taken to Gaza, where 50 remain hostage, with 20 believed to
  be still alive. More than 1,350 Palestinians queueing for aid have been killed
  by Israeli troops since May, according to UNdata published this week. At least
  91 people were killed and hundreds wounded ahead of a visit by the US envoy
  Steve Witkoff to Israel on Friday. Meanwhile, two leading human rights
  organisations based in Israel, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights, say
  Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and western allies
  have a legal and moral duty to stop it. Swinney’s comments follow pressure
  from inside the Scottish National party (SNP), including elected
  representatives in Holyrood and Westminster. Stephen Flynn, the leader of the
  SNP’s nine MPs in Westminster, urged the UK government to call it a genocide
  during questions in the Commons weeks ago. In July, Michelle O’Neill said
  Israel’s actions were “state terrorism”, adding: “It is inhumanity, it is
  genocide, it is wrong.” The Scottish government has been criticised for
  providing money for apprenticeships at firms that build weapons, while not
  directly funding the manufacturing of munitions. The first minister said the
  government’s commercial arm, Scottish Enterprise, had the “strictest
  assessments imaginable about the purpose and the use of public expenditure in
  companies who may be related to defence industries”. Pushed on providing money
  for staff who could build munitions, Swinney said: “We are trying to enable
  companies to diversify their activities, that’s the purpose. That’s why the
  due diligence checks are applied and they are applied unreservedly.”
  Throughout the Edinburgh show, groups of people stood up holding signs that
  together spelled out the word “genocide” and heckled the first minister.
  Swinney’s security team stopped protesters from approaching the stage. As the
  event continued, the interruptions became more forceful, until two groups
  stood up at the same time, shouting at the first minister and chanting slogans
  such as “call it genocide”.
