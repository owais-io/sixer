  Three weeks on from one of the most disappointing evenings of her career in
  Montreal, where the positivity surrounding her progress was overshadowed by
  controversy, Naomi Osaka provided further evidence that she is on the right
  path as she reached the third round of the US Open with an efficient 6-3, 6-1
  win over Hailey Baptiste of the United States. Despite being the most recent
  female player to win multiple US Open titles, Osaka returned to New York this
  year in a curious position. Earlier this month, she won six matches en route
  to her first WTA 1000 final since giving birth to her daughter, Shai, and then
  returning from maternity leave in January 2024. What should have been a
  significant, long-awaited breakthrough for Osaka turned into a painful evening
  after she fell apart in the final against Victoria Mboko and then was widely
  criticised for failing to congratulate the 18-year-old in her runner-up
  speech. Osaka said she contacted Mboko afterwards, who told her she did not
  notice Osaka’s omission. Instead of positively reflecting on her excellent
  performances, Osaka said she spent the days after Montreal processing her
  guilt. “I just felt really bad and, like, shame,” she said. “I think I felt
  worse for my team, because we couldn’t really celebrate properly. They were
  with me this entire time, so they knew how big of a deal the final was.” While
  many thought those difficulties could have halted Osaka’s momentum on the
  court, she has performed well in her two matches this week, striking the ball
  cleanly while showcasing her improved movement. She has now won eight of her
  last nine matches since hiring Tomasz Wiktorowski, the former coach of Iga
  Swiatek. She will face either Daria Kasatkina, the 15th seed, or Kamilla
  Rakhimova as she attempts to reach the fourth round of a grand slam tournament
  for the first time since winning the Australian Open title in 2021. After her
  match, Osaka also waded into the debate over Jelena Ostapenko’s comments
  towards Taylor Townsend after the contentious end to their match on Wednesday.
  Townsend did not apologise after a fortunate net cord, prompting Ostapenko to
  accuse her of having “no education” and “no class”. Osaka said: “It’s really
  difficult to say, I think obviously it’s one of the worst things you can say
  to a black tennis player in a majority white sport. And granted, I know Taylor
  and I know how hard she’s worked and I know how smart she is, so she’s the
  furthest thing from uneducated or anything like that. “But if you’re genuinely
  asking me about the history of Ostapenko, I don’t think that’s the craziest
  thing she’s said. I’m going to be honest. I think it’s ill timing and the
  worst person you could have ever said it to. And I don’t know if she knows the
  history of it in America.” Elsewhere, the men’s top seed, Jannik Sinner,
  continued to build momentum in his title defence by easing into the third
  round with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 win over the big-serving Australian Alexei Popyrin.
  Iga Swiatek, meanwhile, held her nerve at the end of an intense battle to
  close out a 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 win after an impressive fight from Suzan Lamens.
  Venus Williams returned to the court to pick up a win in the doubles, pairing
  up with the 2021 singles runner-up Leylah Fernandez to defeat the sixth seeds
  Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez 7-6 (4), 6-3.
