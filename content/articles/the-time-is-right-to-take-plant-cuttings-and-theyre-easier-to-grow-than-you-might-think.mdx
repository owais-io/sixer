  When we moved into our home, there was a rosemary plant in the bed by the back
  door. It hadn’t been pruned for some time, so was all legs with a short, dark
  green hairdo, and after our first winter it promptly died. Fast-forward to
  around this time last year, when I was searching for my dog after she’d run
  off into the woods. As I was stomping around, yelling her name, I chanced upon
  a luscious, hefty rosemary bush. I carry secateurs on dog walks to clear the
  paths of wandering brambles, so I snipped off a few sprigs and tucked them in
  my pocket. The cuttings I took would be described as semi-hardwood or
  semi-ripe – woodier at the base, with fresh growth at the top – which are
  ideal for starting new plants. Now is the time to do this with rosemary as
  well as sage, lavender, thyme and a host of ornamental shrubs and plants. It
  is key to either get your cuttings prepared immediately or to pop them into a
  bag to be kept in the shade (or even the fridge if it’s very hot) to prevent
  them from wilting and becoming damaged before you have a chance to deal with
  them. Your cutting ought to be about 15cm long after it’s been trimmed to just
  below a leaf node (using a clean, sharp knife), then stripped of all but its
  uppermost leaves. Much traditional gardening advice would now instruct you to
  dip the end of your cutting in rooting hormone, but I can confirm that it is
  possible for your cutting to develop roots without the stuff. Perhaps do some
  additional cuttings to up your chances of success, and if yours root well
  you’ll have plants you can share with other gardeners. All you need to do now
  is pop your cuttings into a pot filled with free-draining compost that’s been
  mixed with plenty of either sand or grit. Your cuttings need to be kept moist,
  but if left in contact with too much water they will rot before they manage to
  root. Situate them in a sheltered corner of a greenhouse or place a plastic
  bag over them before tucking them away somewhere bright and warm but out of
  direct sunlight. The key at this point is to not forget about them entirely,
  as they’ll need regular but not overzealous watering. The time it takes for a
  cutting to root varies, but can be as soon as six weeks. As memory serves,
  mine took much longer and of the 10 or so I took, I have four very happy
  plants growing away – still in their pots. I could have planted them out in
  spring but the spot I have earmarked for them still isn’t quite ready, so I’ll
  probably pot them up in a larger container and keep them protected over
  winter, ready to hit the ground next spring.
