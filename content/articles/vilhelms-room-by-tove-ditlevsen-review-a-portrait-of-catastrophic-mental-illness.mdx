  Tove Ditlevsen’s last novel, Vilhelm’s Room, was originally published in
  Denmark in 1975. As it begins, the protagonist, Lise Mundus, has just been
  abandoned by Vilhelm, her husband of 20 years. He’s a celebrity newspaper
  editor; she’s an acclaimed writer with a history of addiction. From a bed in a
  psychiatric ward, Lise publishes a lonely hearts ad: “Recently escaped a long,
  unhappy marriage – aged 51, but youthful in spirit – wonderful son, aged 15 –
  household literary name – summerhouse – large flat in the city centre –
  temporarily incapacitated by a nervous breakdown – prefers a motorist.” The ad
  is seized upon by Lise’s malicious upstairs neighbour, Mrs Thomsen, who shows
  it to her young lodger/lover, Kurt, hoping he can financially exploit Lise.
  Kurt is duly installed in Lise’s home, but finds himself treated there with
  total indifference. Lise is wholly consumed with memories of Vilhelm and with
  plans to end her own life. We know she will carry these out; in the opening
  pages, she is already dead. In the English-speaking world, Ditlevsen is best
  known for her great trilogy of memoirs, Childhood, Youth and Dependency. Her
  fiction is also often autobiographical to an unusual degree. Lise’s marriage
  isn’t just similar to Ditlevsen’s marriage to the editor Victor Andreasen –
  it’s identical. The lonely hearts ad is an edited form of one Ditlevsen really
  wrote. The book also deliberately elides the distinction between author and
  character. Sometimes Lise is a first-person narrator, but, from one word to
  the next, the “I” can become that of someone discussing a Lise who is already
  dead. In a typically jarring shift, we get: “Only one [photograph] have I
  kept: the photograph of Vilhelm and Lise at the top of Himmelbjerget. We are
  young and happy …” The most crucial likeness between author and character is
  that Tove Ditlevsen would kill herself within a year of the novel’s
  publication. She used the same means as her alter ego, and, in her final
  letters to family, she expressed the same sentiments Lise feels in her last
  moments. What we are reading is an autofictional suicide note. It is no
  surprise, then, that the book isn’t concerned with providing the usual
  pleasures of fiction. The plot is a series of arbitrary events that fail to
  matter to anyone. People have become ugly caricatures even to themselves. As
  an avatar of pain, Vilhelm is the one person who retains his full reality for
  Lise. His diary is full of sadistic ravings about her: “I want to see her
  suffer even more. Yet it’s impossible to bring her to her knees, because for
  her, suffering is so easily transformed into pleasure.” To her face, he rants:
  “When I met you, you were nothing but a blethering drug addict. You knew
  nothing of Rilke, Eliot, or Proust, and now all you do is plagiarise them.”
  Lise seems to revel in this cruelty, the only form of love she can still
  acknowledge. Her only other pleasure is anticipating death. As she heads off
  to take her life, she reflects that Vilhelm will be proud of her, and “is so
  overwhelmed with joy at what is finally within reach that she feels like
  singing and dancing all the way home …” While the book is closely
  autobiographical, it never claims to be a truthful picture. The demand for
  accuracy is just another social dictate the already-dead need not respect. As
  we’re blithely told, “[Out] of sheer impatience to be rid of this Lise … in
  her final book, I basically make her out to be worse than she is.” And, since
  a memoir published in 2023 by Ditlevsen’s granddaughter, Lise Munk Thygesen,
  we’re aware of one crucial omission: the real Victor Andreasen sexually abused
  Ditlevsen’s teenage daughter, Helle, starting when the girl was 15. Ditlevsen
  knew, but never addressed it in her writing. Knowing this radically alters how
  we read Lise’s agonised loathing of Vilhelm and herself. What seemed to be
  fearless self-revelation is actually an exercise in not mentioning the single
  most important fact. It will be obvious from the above that this book isn’t
  for everyone. Some will reject a book that endorses suicide; some will condemn
  Ditlevsen for concealing her husband’s crimes. Reading it can be like
  listening to a stranger ranting disconnectedly about her ex and viciously
  slagging off everyone she knows, while clearly desperately needing help that
  isn’t going to come. But Ditlevsen makes this darkest of all material
  fascinating, perversely likable and occasionally revelatory. She’s a brilliant
  writer and formidable thinker, even with her thinking at its most disordered.
  Vilhelm’s Room can be uneven and heavy-handed, and it’s nothing if not
  problematic. But it remains a unique and powerful document of catastrophic
  mental illness. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on
