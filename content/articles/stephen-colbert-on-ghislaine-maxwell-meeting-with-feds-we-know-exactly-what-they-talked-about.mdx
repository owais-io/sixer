  Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump’s impromptu press conference on the
  White House roof and Ghislaine Maxwell’s prison transfer after meeting with
  the feds. Stephen Colbert “So often these days, folks, the news goes from
  stupid to sad to sadly stupid,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show.
  “But today I’m happy to report it’s just plain dumb.” Because on Tuesday
  morning, Trump held an impromptu press conference from the White House roof,
  prompting one reporter to shout: “Sir! Why are you on the roof?” “That’s not a
  question you hear asked of a world leader that often,” Colbert laughed. “It’s
  right up there with ‘Your majesty! Where are your pants?’” Trump also appeared
  to be gesturing with hand signals that Colbert translated to “Look, the
  Capitol dome is a D-cup.” Another reporter shouted at Trump: “What does that
  mean?” “Yeah, what does that mean?!” Colbert shouted toward a camera perched
  at the top of the Ed Sullivan Theater. “What does any of this mean? How are
  you the guy in charge? Why do we have to pretend it’s normal when an old man
  wanders around a roof and shouts at us? “Whatever Trump climbs up on next, he
  won’t escape the Jeffrey Epstein story,” Colbert continued, turning to new
  developments in the never-ending saga of Trump’s former friend and convicted
  sex offender. A few weeks ago, Trump sent his No 2 at the justice department,
  Todd Blanche – also his personal attorney in the Stormy Daniels hush-money
  trial – to visit Epstein’s former girlfriend and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell
  in prison. “Now, we don’t know exactly what they talked about,” said Colbert,
  “but we know exactly what they talked about,” because Maxwell has now been
  moved to a minimum-security women’s prison in Texas that’s been nicknamed
  “Club Fed”. “It’s so bougie that inmates may take lessons on foreign languages
  and gardening,” Colbert explained. “Well, you know what they say: on your
  first day in prison, you will walk up straight to the biggest guy in the yard
  and say ‘Excusez-moi, avez-vous le mulch?’” The White House has denied that
  its trading favors with Maxwell, and insist she was moved due to “very real
  and very credible threats on her life”, because talking to the feds made her a
  “snitch” to the other inmates. “Right, because everyone in the slammer knows:
  snitches get puppies,” Colbert quipped. Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth
  Meyers noted that last week, Trump raised the tariff rate on Canadian goods
  from 25% to 35%. “I guess he can do that now we’re making Canadian tuxedos
  here in the US,” Meyers joked next to actor Sydney Sweeney in an all-denim
  outfit for her controversial American Eagle ad campaign. In a new podcast
  interview, JD Vance defended Sweeney’s ad campaign. “Look, I’m all for it if
  it means these dorks are going to start dressing like that,” said Meyers.
  Trump also spoke up in defense of Sweeney. On Truth Social, he said: “Sydney
  Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the hottest ad out there. It’s for
  American Eagle and the jeans are flying off the shelves! Go get ’em Sydney!”
  “Oh my God, there’s a current young famous person who votes Republican,”
  Meyers marveled. “I feel so bad for Kid Rock right now. You know he’s getting
  left on read this week.” And during a briefing last week, the White House
  press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said that Trump had “a big heart”. “The
  technical term is ‘enlarged’, said his doctor,” Meyers quipped.
