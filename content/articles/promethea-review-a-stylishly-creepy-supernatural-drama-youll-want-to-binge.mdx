  The greatest mystery in any French mystery drama is how the characters look so
  much better than any English person has ever looked. How did the cast of The
  Returned (more than 10 years ago now, though it feels like yesterday) look so
  gorgeous all the time, despite seemingly ordinary costumes, hair and makeup?
  Is Gallic bone structure really that different? Do clothes just hang better on
  the other side of la Manche? Is that why they call it “the sleeve”? Is it a
  clue? Forgive me. I am consumed by this puzzle. The success of a French drama
  can be measured by how successfully the official narrative mystery distracts
  me from the conundrum, and here the new six-part series Promethea does just
  fine. We begin with married couple the Lassets – Caroline (Marie-Josée Croze),
  a headteacher, and Charles (Thomas Jouannet), a doctor – hitting something
  that dashes out of the woods as they are driving home on a dark, rainy night.
  It turns out to be a teenage girl (played by Fantine Harduin) with neither a
  stitch of clothing nor a scratch on her. She remembers nothing about where she
  comes from or who she is, except for her name, Prométhée. They take her to
  hospital where she is examined by doctors and questioned by the police and,
  later by Charles’s colleague, psychoanalyst Marie (Odile Vuillemin). No
  concerned parents have reported her missing and the only clue to her identity
  is a tattoo on her wrist of a jellyfish. The police, led by the permanently
  vaping officer Elise (Camille Lou), have been investigating the brutal murder
  two months previously of a teenage girl called Lea, but have come up with
  nothing. This changes when Prométhée starts drawing sketches that seem to
  match photos taken of the crime scene and having flashbacks to bloody horrors
  that suggest much but obviously won’t resolve into solid information until we
  have had a few more episodes of fun with them. The Lassets’ daughter was
  killed in a motorcycle accident two years before, and the sense of pervasive
  grief is heartbreakingly shown, not least in their inadvertent emotional
  neglect of their sweet son, Hugo (Aymeric Fougeron). They are all immured by
  misery and Hugo doesn’t resent his parents for their behaviour, but takes what
  comfort he can in his girlfriend, Vanessa (Margot Heckmann). When Prométhée
  moves in with the Lassets to avoid going into foster care, the emotional
  stakes increase in intensity and complexity. Clues and connections begin to
  take shape as everyone hares off on their own private investigations. Charles
  would like to know why there is blood on the car windscreen, but no visible
  injury to the girl herself. And it’s hard not to agree that this is a
  fundamental question that needs to be answered. He sends a blood sample to the
  lab for testing. Prométhée tracks down the house that she keeps drawing from
  memory flashbacks and the jellyfish tattoo artist who may know who she is.
  Vanessa is Elise’s sister, which entwines the two families and plot lines from
  the start. Then Prométhée starts scrabbling in Lea’s garden and unearths a box
  of photos that one may assume the teenage girl did not intend her parents to
  see, but which at last provide a lead for Elise and her team. It is almost
  enough( along with Marie’s icy, watchful presence and her volunteered
  information that she has brittle bone disease – the equivalent of
  ostentatiously placing a gun on a Chekovian mantlepiece) without the
  suggestion of the supernatural that hardens into near-certainty as Prométhée
  begins to reveal unexpected physical powers. By this time, we are along for
  the stylishly creepy ride, so let’s enjoy it. There is nothing wonderfully new
  or innovative here, but it is a nicely packaged and paced six hours of solid
  entertainment. It is a flavoursome binge rather than something to be lingered
  over and savoured, but who doesn’t have an appetite for that? And the sorrows
  of the two sets of parents add enough heft to keep it from being a simple
  potboiler, though with everything apart from their grief, tidy resolution is
  promised, every loose end tied up. Apart, of course, from that mystery of how
  they look so ordinary and so good all the time. Promethea launches on Channel
  4 on Sunday and is available from streaming now.
