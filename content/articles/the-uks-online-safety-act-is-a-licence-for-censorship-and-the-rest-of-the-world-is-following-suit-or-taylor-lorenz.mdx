  Over the past two weeks, the UK has reportedly blocked internet users’ access
  to everything from SpongeBob SquarePants gifs to Spotify playlists.
  Information about Joe Biden’s police funding plan has been restricted, along
  with a post about an up-and-coming political party. Gamers say they have been
  unable to tweak colours in games such as Minecraft. And it’s all because of a
  new age verification law. Since the child safety provisions contained within
  the Online Safety Act came into effect on 25 July, web service providers have
  been forced to institute “highly effective” age verification measures to
  prevent children from accessing “harmful” or “adult” content. The penalty for
  failing to adequately comply with the act includes hefty fines and potential
  criminal action. But while the law and others like it claim to be narrowly
  focused on pornographic content and material that promotes suicide, self-harm,
  eating disorders or abusive and hateful behaviour, the subjective nature of
  the restrictions has led to mass censorship, with the de facto removal of vast
  swaths of content from the web. Tech companies find it easier and cheaper to
  simply remove mass amounts of information than have something slip through and
  be deemed non-compliant. The Online Safety Act is just the latest in a
  troubling global trend towards a more censored internet, within which
  governments and data harvesters have obliterated privacy and everything you do
  online is logged, tracked and monitored. Australia and Ireland have passed
  similar age verification measures. Denmark, Greece, Spain, France and Italy
  have started testing a common age‑verification app, paving the way for
  potential mandatory EU-wide use. In the US, 11 states are seeking to pass age
  verification laws. In 2022, Louisiana passed a law requiring age verification
  on all websites on which at least a third of the content is of an adult
  nature. Since then, states including Ohio, Arizona, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and
  New Jersey, among others, have pursued similar legislation, mandating age
  verification to access “harmful” or “adult” material. On a federal level, the
  Kids Online Safety Act, which would prevent all underage users from accessing
  certain content, was revived last year in Congress and could move forward any
  day. While preventing kids from accessing allegedly harmful content online
  sounds like a great idea, these laws set the stage for authoritarian
  censorship, violate young people’s core civil liberties, forcibly expose users
  to significant privacy risks and utterly fail at their goal of “protecting
  kids”. Many people mistakenly believe that only children will have to verify
  their identities online under such laws, but that is false. In order to
  determine who is a child, all users, no matter who they are, will be forced to
  turn over vast troves of valuable biometric data and for ever link their
  offline identity to their online behaviour. The data collected could then be
  weaponised by the government or bad actors, and put internet users at
  significantly higher risk of crimes such as identity theft and fraud. Age
  verification is a massive gift to big tech. Persona, the leading third-party
  identity verification platform, recently announced a $2bn valuation after its
  latest funding round co-led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. Additionally, only
  the largest and most powerful tech platforms have the resources to enact age
  verification at scale, meaning smaller indie social networks and non-profit
  driven platforms for services such as patient support groups or online
  communities for addicts and disabled people could be forced to shut down. The
  loss of these communities, which are a lifeline for people struggling, will be
  devastating. “Alcoholics Anonymous has gone,” one Reddit user posted after the
  UK’s age verification laws went into effect. “As a non tech savvy recovering
  alcoholic this is a bummer as I used to get some hope and support from the
  subs.” Age verification laws are also preventing people in the UK from
  accessing news and journalistic content. Immediately after the child safety
  rules came into effect, platforms began classifying breaking news footage, war
  coverage, investigative journalism and political protest material as harmful
  content. Even some content on Wikipedia could soon be blocked. The platform is
  challenging the law due to concerns its anonymous volunteers and readers could
  have their privacy violated. This mass gating of information prevents young
  people from accessing independent reporting and community analysis of breaking
  news. It removes opportunities for critical thinking and civic understanding,
  and isolates young people from global perspectives and connections. It ensures
  we have a less informed public and that young people are fed a steady diet of
  sanitised, government‑approved narratives until the age of 18. None of this
  keeps kids safe or away from harmful material. Use of VPNs has rocketed,
  raising even more privacy risks and shuffling kids into even more extreme,
  less regulated corners of the internet. Despite the disastrous British
  rollout, US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle are giddily seeking
  to replicate the act. Democrats and Republicans are completely aligned on
  restricting free speech and anonymous use of the internet. Last year, at a
  summit for content creators at the White House attended by Biden, the then
  president, his adviser Neera Tanden spoke about the administration’s goal of
  removing all anonymity from the web. She asked content creators to raise their
  hands if they wanted to “unmask every troll”. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a
  Democrat, has partnered with Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, to
  co-sponsor the Kids Online Safety Act, which Blackburn said was necessary to
  protect kids from “the transgender” in society. The Heritage Foundation, the
  hard-right thinktank that authored Project 2025, has said openly that the
  Republican party will use the Kids Online Safety Act to get LGBTQ+ content
  removed from the web, and suggested it could be influenced to promote
  “pro-life values” under the guise of child safety. The public cannot afford to
  be complacent. We need to do everything in our power to fight for free speech,
  privacy and open access to information while we still can. Once the
  infrastructure for online censorship is built, it will be impossible to
  dismantle it. The era of a free, open and diverse internet that fosters
  creativity and connection and incubates social justice movements will be over.
  We must refuse to allow the government and the media to normalise mass
  censorship in response to a manufactured moral panic about technology and
  social media. We need to root out opportunists making the false and hyperbolic
  claims about the internet that these laws are predicated on. And we need to
  use our voices to fight back, loudly, against these “child online safety
  bills” that erode our civil liberties and will destroy the internet as we know
  it. These laws are not about protecting kids. They are about censorship,
  control and authoritarianism. Taylor Lorenz is a technology journalist who
