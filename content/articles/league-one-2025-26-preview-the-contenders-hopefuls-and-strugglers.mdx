  Promotion hopefuls Last season was grim for Luton, culminating in them
  suffering a second successive relegation. But there remains plenty of quality
  at Kenilworth Road. Teden Mengi could easily be playing in the top flight,
  while Millenic Alli is a leading light of the recent intake. Most importantly,
  perhaps, the manager, Matt Bloomfield, knows this division well. Cardiff were
  also relegated from the Championship last season and will be hoping their new
  manager, Brian Barry-Murphy, can arrest the Welsh club’s slide. Stockport
  missed out in the playoffs last season after finishing third. They also lost
  Isaac Olaofe to Charlton but have invested a club-record fee in Malik
  Mothersille from Peterborough to fill the void. The Hatters will be confident
  of another promotion push as long as they can hold on to the highly rated
  Ethan Pye and Lewis Bate, who have attracted Championship interest over the
  summer. Huddersfield are another who have changed manager, bringing in Lee
  Grant for what is the former Stoke goalkeeper’s first managerial role. Grant
  has sought experience on the pitch, signing Ryan Ledson, Murray Wallace,
  Lynden Gooch and Alfie May. Tom Cleverley has taken the reins at Plymouth
  after their relegation from the Championship, while Mike Dodds will need
  Richard Kone to stay put if Wycombe are to battle for a spot in the
  Championship. Playoff hopefuls Steve Bruce will not want to be known as a
  League One manager for another season. He arrived at Blackpool midway through
  the last campaign and has been given the resources to push for a return to the
  second tier. Fraser Horsfall and Michael Ihiekwe have been acquired to
  strengthen central defence, and with Ashley Fletcher leading the line, Bruce’s
  men will be hoping to rustle feathers. Reading did well to finish seventh last
  season considering the issues surrounding the club. Rob Couhig has become the
  new owner and a calmer presence in the boardroom could translate on to the
  pitch. Bolton finished eighth last season and their manger, Steven Schumacher,
  will be hoping to better that this time around. The loan signings of Teddy
  Sharman-Lowe and Amario Cozier-Duberry should excite but the loss of the
  captain, George Thomason, to Wrexham will need addressing. Leyton Orient made
  it to Wembley but fell just short in the playoff final. Ethan Galbraith and
  the loan stars Josh Keeley, Charlie Kelman and Jamie Donley have departed but
  there is plenty of excitement around the impending arrival of the Manchester
  United youngster Jack Moorhouse. Rotherham were expecting to challenge under
  Steve Evans last season but eventually stumbled to 13th. They have
  subsequently had a clearout of some big earners and allowed Matt Hamshaw to
  shape a more youthful squad. Conor Hourihane has used the loan market wisely
  to bring Barnsley up to scratch, while Ryan Lowe will be hoping Paul Mullin
  can spearhead Wigan’s promotion push. Lincoln and Mansfield have an outside
  chance of getting into the playoffs. Relegation candidates Doncaster won the
  League Two title last season and their manager, Grant McCann, quickly moved to
  sign Connor O’Riordan as a replacement for Joseph Olowu after his move to
  Stockport. Port Vale, who finished runners-up to Doncaster, have enjoyed a
  busy summer in the market as the manager, Darren Moore, attempts to balance
  youthful potential with old heads. Bradford, the third team to be promoted
  from League Two, may have half an eye on more than consolidation this season.
  For sure, Ibou Touray and Max Power will provide Graham Alexander’s men with
  plenty of knowhow at this level. The League Two playoff winners, AFC
  Wimbledon, have been here before, playing six consecutive seasons in the third
  tier. Gary Bowyer oversaw the great escape with Burton last season and a
  continuation of that momentum should result in a better campaign for them.
  Exeter, Northampton and Stevenage might be fearful should they not start the
  season well. Three to watch Andre Garcia, Reading, 17 The defender does not
  turn 18 until late November but already has 38 League One games under his
  belt. Garcia’s performances at left-back also earned him an England Under-18
  call-up in March and plenty of scouts are known to be tracking his progress.
  Benony Breki Andrésson, Stockport, 19 Having spent time in Bologna’s academy,
  Andrésson’s career began in earnest in his homeland of Iceland. Stockport were
  alerted to his potential and duly signed the striker in January to be part of
  their development team. He was quickly promoted to the first team and repaid
  the faith of his manager, Dave Challinor, with four goals in 11 games. Cian
  Ashford, Cardiff, 20 The local boy who has risen through the ranks and become
  a regular will be looking to push on this season. The arrival of Barry-Murphy
  as manager should help with that given the Irishman has worked with some of
  the best talent in the country during his time at Manchester City.
