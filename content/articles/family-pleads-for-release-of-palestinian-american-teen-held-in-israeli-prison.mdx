  The family of a 16-year-old dual American-Palestinian citizen is trying to
  secure his release from an Israeli prison where he has been held in detention
  for more than five months and where they say he has lost a significant amount
  of weight and developed a severe skin infection. Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim was
  still 15 when he was arrested at his family’s home in the occupied West Bank
  village of Silwad in February. According to relatives, he was blindfolded and
  handcuffed before being taken to the Megiddo prison in Israel, where he
  remains in pre-trial detention accused of throwing rocks – accusations his
  family denies. Mohammed, the youngest of five, lives in the West Bank but his
  family splits their time between the village and Palm Bay, Florida. His
  father, Zaher Ibrahim, reached out to Republican congressman Mike Haridopolos
  from their home state of Florida in March, pleading for help after more than
  45 days without contact with his son. “The Megiddo Prison is notorious for
  brutality and suffering,” Zaher Ibrahim wrote in a form he sent to Haridopolos
  that has been viewed by the Guardian. “We are kindly asking for some support
  in this matter. We have exhausted all efforts locally here in Israel and have
  no other option than to ask our local Florida office officials to reach out on
  our behalf.” Haridopolos’s office confirmed it had been contacted about
  Mohammed Ibrahim and said it had shared the family’s information with the
  state department. The office said it had been informed that the US embassy in
  Israel was “following standard procedures”. A spokesperson for the state
  department said in a statement there is “no higher priority than the safety
  and security of US citizens”. The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to
  queries about the allegations against Ibrahim, directing questions to the
  Israel Prison Service, which manages the Megiddo prison. The IPS has not
  responded to requests for comment. The Guardian first became aware of Mohammed
  Ibrahim’s detention through reporting on his cousin Sayfollah Musallet, a
  20-year-old dual US-Palestinian citizen allegedly beaten to death by Israeli
  settlers in the West Bank earlier in July while visiting relatives. Ibrahim is
  one of hundreds of Palestinian children in Israeli military detention, where
  advocates say even US citizenship offers little protection from a system that
  routinely holds minors for extended periods without charge or family contact
  during proceedings that can drag on for months. “Palestinian children in
  Israeli prisons are totally disconnected from the outside world,” Ayed Abu
  Eqtaish, the West Bank-based accountability program director at Defense for
  Children International-Palestine said. “They will not recognize whether you
  are American, Somalian or whatever your citizenship.” US embassy officials
  have conducted welfare checks on Mohammed Ibrahim since his detention but have
  faced restrictions in recent weeks, according to an email sent by a state
  department official to the family. Zaher, Mohammed’s father, said he was
  informed by the embassy after an early visit that his son appeared to have
  lost 12kg (26lb) in the spring. In mid-July, the state department informed the
  family in an email seen by the Guardian that Ibrahim was suffering from
  scabies, a contagious skin infection caused by mites, and was receiving
  medical treatment, and said US officials would visit once he recovered. Local
  staff with the state department did not comment on Ibrahim’s health or whether
  they’ve been able to see him since, but in a statement a spokesperson told the
  Guardian the department “works to provide consular assistance which may
  include visiting detained US citizens to ensure they have access to necessary
  medication or medical attention and facilitating authorized communications
  with their family or others”. Ibrahim’s lawyer did not return a request for
  comment to clarify the status of the case against him, but a video seen by the
  Guardian of Ibrahim’s interrogation while in detention shows Israeli officials
  questioning the teenager over rock-throwing in Silwad. He did not appear to
  have a lawyer present. As of March 2025, 323 Palestinian children between the
  ages of 12 and 17 were being held in Israeli military detention, according to
  data from the Defense for Children International-Palestine. According to a
  2011 report from B’Tselem, 835 Palestinian minors between the ages of 12 and
  17 were tried on stone-throwing charges in military courts between 2005 and
  2010, and only one minor was acquitted. A majority of the minors would receive
  sentences of longer than four months. Since Hamas’s 7 October attacks and
  Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza, conditions for Palestinian detainees
  from both Gaza and the West Bank have deteriorated significantly. Advocates
  say military prosecutors have now become less willing to negotiate plea deals
  that might lead to earlier releases. “After October 2023, the situation was
  harsher,” Abu Eqtaish said. “Now they are stricter in punishment and
  sentences. We encounter problems knowing about living conditions inside
  prisons. There’s no family presence. Lawyer visits are very restricted.”
