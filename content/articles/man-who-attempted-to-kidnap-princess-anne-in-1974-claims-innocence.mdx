  The gunman who shot police officers during a botched attempt to kidnap
  Princess Anne has claimed he is innocent, six years after being released from
  a psychiatric hospital. Ian Ball, who uses the pseudonym Anthony Stewart,
  claimed he expected Queen Elizabeth II’s daughter to have been swapped for a
  double and the gunpowder removed from his bullets ahead of the attempt in
  March 1974. In an interview with the Daily Mail, Ball also said the queen had
  been the “ringleader” of a plot that led him to be wrongfully jailed. “I’m an
  innocent, sane man,” the 77-year-old said. Ball, then 26, chased Anne and her
  then-husband Captain Mark Phillips in their limousine through central London
  as they drove towards Buckingham Palace after a charity film screening more
  than five decades ago. He eventually cornered the royal couple and their lady
  in waiting in the Mall, yards from the palace, forcing their car to stop. In
  the attempt to drag Anne away, he shot her bodyguard, chauffeur, a police
  officer, and a journalist. The princess was said to have infamously retorted
  “not bloody likely” when he asked him to go with her. A passing retired
  heavyweight boxer, Ronnie Russell, subdued Ball and punched him. Anne’s
  bodyguard, former Metropolitan police inspector Jim Beaton, was awarded the
  George Cross after being shot three times as he protected Anne. Ball said:
  “[Anne] wasn’t bothered on the night. I didn’t scare her. I was more scared
  than she was.” Ball pleaded guilty to charges of attempted murder, attempted
  kidnap and wounding at the Old Bailey months after the crime. He was detained
  without time limit under the Mental Health Act, and spent 45 years in
  Broadmoor and Rampton psychiatric hospitals. He was released in 2019. He was
  hoping to get a £3m ransom from the queen. However, he now claims the plot was
  always supposed to have failed and was an attempt to garner publicity to sell
  an autobiography. He said he was aided by an apparent local police officer,
  “Frank”, who was supposed to have swapped the bullets and the princess. He
  told the Mail: “I had good reason to believe the gunpowder had been taken out
  of the bullets and another girl had been substituted for Princess Anne.” He
  added: “The whole idea of performing the hoax was to get the publicity so I
  could write my autobiography and I expected to get £10,000 in royalties.” He
  also denied Anne had uttered the famous line, instead telling her would-be
  kidnapper: “You just go away and nobody will think any more about it.” Ball
  has written an self-published autobiographical novel on the incident, To
  Kidnap a Princess. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Restricted
  patients can be recalled back to hospital if their mental health deteriorates
  to such a level that the risk they pose becomes unmanageable in the
  community.” Anne, who was 23 at the time of the attempted kidnapping, later
  said she was “furious at this man who was having a tug of war with me” and for
  ripping her favourite blue velvet dress. Anne’s father, Prince Philip, later
  quipped of the attempted kidnapping: “If the man had succeeded in abducting
  Anne, she would have given him a hell of a time in captivity.”
