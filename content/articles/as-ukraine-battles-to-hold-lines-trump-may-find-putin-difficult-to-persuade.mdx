  For Ukraine, the break in the frontline is unfortunately timed. Lightly armed
  Russian saboteur groups – three on one count – cut though Ukrainian positions
  in the Donbas countryside east of the key junction at Dobropillia. Though one
  group has been eliminated, as of Tuesday two were thought to remain at large –
  and although their numbers are small for now, perhaps 20 to 30, the breach is
  significant. At the beginning of the year it was safe to visit Dobropillia,
  which had become a bustling market centre busy with soldiers and locals,
  nearly 15 miles north of the frontline in Pokrovsk. But since then the town,
  where once busy supply roads from Pokrovsk to Kramatorsk split, has come under
  sustained attack with glide bombs, while FPV (first person view) drones strike
  targets on the move. It is part of an increasingly coordinated battle strategy
  by the invaders. Experts say Russia has become more effective at targeting
  Ukrainian drone teams in the field and forces on the move. Even before the
  weekend, the southerly T0514 supply road to Kramatorsk was at risk of attack,
  while a Russian military blogger described “the systematic elimination” of
  Ukrainian crews. At the same time, Ukraine’s forces appear increasingly
  stretched. Critics such as Bohdan Krotevych, a former chief of staff at the
  Azov brigade, say too much attention has been focused on infantry
  counterstrikes in Pokrovsk – “a soap bubble that will soon burst” – and not
  enough on augmenting defences to hold existing lines. Ukraine’s military, at
  the urging of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sent in Azov to try to eliminate the
  infiltrators. But however small their numbers are, there are more Russians
  nearby. Ukraine’s high command said on Tuesday there were about 110,000
  Russian troops near Pokrovsk – and Zelenskyy said another 12,000 were expected
  to come from Sumy in the north-east to join them in an offensive. All this
  comes two days before Donald Trump hosts Vladimir Putin at a US military base
  in Alaska. It is not entirely clear what Putin has offered to win the prize of
  a summit on American soil, amid talk that Trump’s negotiator, the real estate
  developer Steve Witkoff, misunderstood what the Russian leader said last week.
  However, Zelenskyy thinks Putin will offer to agree to a ceasefire only if
  Ukraine voluntarily gives up the 3,400 square miles of Donetsk oblast it
  holds, including Kramatorsk. It is not an offer that Ukraine can accept, as
  Zelenskyy has repeatedly made clear in the last week. But Trump may well find
  it difficult to persuade Putin to shift his position if the Russian leader
  sees that Kyiv cannot snuff out the incursion. Already Putin thinks Russia is
  slowly winning the Ukraine war, and while previous advances near Pokrovsk have
  been costly and slow for the attackers, it is possible there will be an
  acceleration in momentum. Last August, Ukraine launched a surprise offensive
  into the Kursk region of Russia, penetrating more than 12 miles deep. It
  restored morale in Kyiv and promised a bargaining chip in future peace
  negotiations. But as Russia fought back, that notional value has disappeared.
  Though the Kursk offensive prevented Russia from mounting an effective
  offensive in Donbas in 2024, with the benefit of a longer view the problem for
  Ukraine may only have been deferred into 2025. Throughout the war, Russia has
  shown it struggles to capture small urban centres. It took a year to capture
  Bakhmut, also in Donbas, in May 2023. Pokrovsk was evacuated last August and
  was expected to fall within weeks. Though Russian forces have reached the edge
  of the city they have still not captured it, concentrating instead on slowly
  trying to envelop it. Where Russia has been more successful is in rural areas.
  It will now hope to cut off more roads coming west into Kramatorsk, the heart
  of Donetsk oblast that Putin so badly wants. The invaders are helped by the
  growing range of FPV drones, including unjammable fibre-optic craft, rapidly
  extending the so-called “kill zone” to 9-12 miles or more. Even so, any
  Russian progress cross-country is likely to be slow: 34 miles has been
  occupied in 17 months since the centre of the Donestk front began to give way
  in February 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War. On
  Wednesday afternoon Trump insisted there would be “very severe consequences”
  for Putin unless he agreed to a ceasefire in Ukraine. Ukrainian politicians
  such as Halyna Yanchenko, an MP in Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party,
  pin their hopes on Trump levying secondary sanctions on Russia’s oil exports
  to China, worth €4.1bn last month, partly because there is no prospect of any
  other form of US intervention. An extraordinary set of figures provided by
  Zelenskyy illustrated the key problem Ukraine faces and what Putin is prepared
  to do. On Monday, he said, there were 531 soldiers on Russia’s side killed,
  428 wounded and nine captured, while on Ukraine’s side 18 were killed, 243
  wounded and 79 went missing. Despite the disparity, Russia attacks every day,
  taking similar numbers of casualties as it does so. As long as there continues
  to be no domestic resistance in Russia, the likelihood is that Putin will feel
  he can afford to string out negotiations with Trump, despite the threats.
