  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 12th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie
  Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 10th Prospects Leicester’s rather muted pre-season got turned upside
  down with the announcement that the club had parted ways with the manager
  Amandine Miquel 11 days before the start of their campaign. On the face of it,
  the decision appears to be harsh on a manager who will feel she was building
  something after a rollercoaster of a first year. As injury after injury rolled
  in during the first four months of last season, Miquel cut an increasingly
  baffled figure at her side’s constant run of bad fortune and her lack of
  centre-forward options. Jutta Rantala, Lena Petermann and Noémie Mouchon
  sustained season-ending injuries; Shana Chossenotte was troubled by recurrent
  injury issues; and Deanne Rose and Hannah Cain continued their recovery from
  long-term problems. The defensive midfielder Saori Takarada and Ruby Mace were
  among those given a try-out in the No 9 role as Miquel tried to find a
  solution. An impressive 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea in December proved a
  turning point. A strong finish meant Leicester recorded their highest WSL
  points tally, securing 10th place. They were a team built on solid defensive
  play, quick transitions and a strong trust in young players – a hallmark of
  Miquel’s style – and the foundations looked to have been laid for the coming
  campaign. There has been player turnover this summer and recruitment has been
  a challenge. Seven players have left, leading to a loss of experience.
  Petermann, Takarada and CJ Bott returned home and the departures of the
  ever-present Sophie Howard to FC Como and Yuka Momiki to Everton will have
  been a blow. Only three players have come through the door. The 18-year-old
  goalkeeper Katie Keane is one of the Republic of Ireland’s brightest young
  talents and made the move from Shamrock Rovers. The experienced midfielder
  Celeste Boureille arrived from Montpellier and Heather Payne also signed.
  Leicester’s problems could mount rapidly given their tough start. They face
  Manchester United and Chelsea in the first three games, a challenge that has
  become more difficult in recent days. The manager The rumour mill is circling
  around who Miquel’s replacement could be, with Matt Beard a strong contender
  after his shock departure from Burnley. As it stands the team are manager-less
  at a time when several key rivals are recruiting significantly. Whoever comes
  in will have their work cut out and will need to get a young team up to
  scratch very quickly to avoid a washout. Off-field picture The appointment of
  Lee Billiard as director of women’s and girls’ football was regarded as a coup
  after his four-year spell at Aston Villa as Leicester look to build for
  success on the pitch and commercially. Now without a manager and assistant
  manager – Amaury Messuwe also departed – he will be busy as the season
  approaches, with the squad also needing to be bolstered. Will the decision to
  remove Miquel prove to be the making or breaking of his tenure at the club?
  Star signing In a relatively quiet summer to date, Payne has been the signing
  that has caught the eye. The Republic of Ireland international arrived after
  two years at Everton and getting over recent injury struggles. A versatile
  wide player, the 25-year-old has the attacking attributes to thrive as a
  winger but can equally be used as a full-back or wing-back. With more than 50
  caps, she adds to Leicester’s growing international contingent and played a
  significant role in Ireland’s inaugural World Cup appearance in 2023. Stepping
  up: The 17-year-old Nelly Las has had a year to remember for club and country
  and signed a new contract this summer. Her transition from Leicester’s
  academy, which she joined at the age of nine, to the senior setup has appeared
  seamless. She made her debut in the League Cup in October 2024 and has since
  been a regular in the matchday squad. A dynamic full-back, Las can play on
  either flank and was also utilised further forward by Miquel. She was a core
  member of the England squad that finished fourth at the Under-17 Women’s World
  Cup last autumn before helping the Under-19s qualify for next year’s U20 World
  Cup. It was a good summer for… Olivia Clark and Cain made history this summer
  as part of the Wales team that competed at Euro 2025. Clark, a goalkeeper,
  played in two of Cymru’s three matches. Cain, a forward, was a starter in
  their opener against the Netherlands before coming off the bench against
  France and England. She announced herself on the European stage with a finely
  taken goal against the Lionesses. Although Wales lost all three group games,
  it was a memorable summer for Rhian Wilkinson’s side, a first taste of major
  tournament football on which to build for the future. Main initiative to
  attract more fans Leicester will continue to play at the King Power Stadium,
  with season ticket and matchday packages provided. A season ticket will not
  only get fans into every home game but also provide priority access to away
  games, exclusive events and retail launches and a 10% discount on stadium tour
  experiences. Children can also be a mascot (seven-11 years) and get an
  invitation to the junior Christmas party. The club put on coach travel to away
  games.
