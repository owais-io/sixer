  The ever-bombastic Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly of his trade victories,
  while White House news releases trumpet his “historic trade wins”. The Wall
  Street Journal echoed Trump’s triumphalism with a headline saying, “Trump is
  Winning His Trade War”, and last week the New York Times used the exact same
  words in a headline. That must have been music to the president’s ears.
  Forgive me for being a spoilsport, but I don’t see where the victory is or how
  Trump is winning. I keep reading how Trump’s trade war and tariff machinations
  have pushed up inflation, slashed US job gains, slowed economic growth and
  caused the manufacturing sector to sputter. The rate of job growth plunged by
  over 70% in the three months after Trump unveiled his 2 April “liberation day”
  tariffs that filled corporate executives with uncertainty and dread. Trump is
  palpably impatient for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but the
  higher prices resulting from his tariffs are likely to delay the rate cuts he
  desperately wants. So can someone please tell me where is the victory here?
  Trump further proclaims that his tariffs are wondrous because, he says, they
  will generate trillions of dollars in revenue for the US Treasury. But those
  revenues will come out of the hides of tens of millions of American consumers
  who will pay Trump’s taxes on imports. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that the
  price increases caused by Trump’s tariffs will cost the typical US household
  $2,400 in 2025. As a result of the tariffs, the budget lab says, apparel
  prices will soar 37% and shoe prices 39%. What Trump boasts as a win is a loss
  for millions of typical Americans. Some economists are warning that Trump’s
  tariffs will bring back stagflation, a dangerous combination of rising prices
  and slowing growth last seen in the 1970s. Pointing to signs of stagflation,
  BMO Economics wrote: “Economic activity and job growth are sputtering under
  the weight of higher tariffs, increasing inflation and rising economic policy
  and trade uncertainty.” Doesn’t look as if Trump’s trade war is winning there.
  Trump recently said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that “people love the tariffs”, but
  evidently the people he’s talking about aren’t the American people. A recent
  Fox News poll of registered voters found that Americans overwhelmingly
  disapprove of Trump’s tariff policies by 62% to 36%. Ben May, a forecaster at
  Oxford Economics, said his tariffs will hurt US families because “they are
  obviously raising prices … and squeezing household incomes”. Many days it
  seems that Trump tries to dominate the news cycle with some tariff
  announcement or other: 50% on Brazil, double India’s tariffs to 50%, impose a
  100% tariff on semiconductors. (Even some Maga folks probably think he uses
  tariff announcements to distract from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.) This week
  the White House dismayed the world by announcing that Trump would impose
  tariffs, ranging from 15% to 50%, on 90 countries effective Thursday. As a
  result of Trump’s tariff craze, the average effective tariff rate on imports
  into the US will be 18%, up from 2.3% last year – the highest level since the
  infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 worsened the Great Depression. Remember
  when Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted last April that the
  administration would negotiate 90 deals in 90 days. That didn’t come close to
  happening. But Trump did pressure the EU, Japan and South Korea into
  reluctantly accepting trade deals that call for tariffs of 15% – a compromise
  down from the 25% and 30% levels Trump had been demanding. Even though the EU,
  Japan and South Korea have long been among America’s closest allies, Trump
  used nasty threats to get them to accept those tariffs, which will hurt those
  countries’ manufacturers, while also hurting US consumers. Here’s one way to
  look at Trump’s strong-arm tactics: when a bully demands that a person do
  something that that person doesn’t want to do and that something will hurt not
  just that person, but also the bully’s family – and probably the bully, too,
  long-term – how is that winning, rather than bull-headed destructiveness? Some
  headline writers might lazily conclude that Trump is winning his trade war (a
  war of headstrong destructiveness), but in that war, everyone and everything,
  except Trump’s limitless ego and a handful of US industries, are losers. There
  are many other reasons Trump’s trade deals shouldn’t be viewed as victories.
  Trump’s main motivation for tariffs is arguably to increase manufacturing in
  the US, but factory activity has actually declined in recent months, according
  to the Institute for Supply Management. Harley-Davidson says it has reduced
  production because of tariff-induced uncertainty and higher expenses. Ford,
  which assembles more cars in the US than any other automaker, complains that
  Trump’s tariff mess caused its profits to fall by $800m in the second quarter.
  Trumps’s mishmash of tariffs, including steep import taxes on steel, aluminum
  and auto parts, have made Ford’s production more problematic and expensive.
  Trump’s trade war has pushed relations with many countries to their worst
  point in decades. Acting more like a mob boss than a dealmaker, Trump has told
  various nations that if they promise to cough up several hundred billion
  dollars in investment in the US, he’ll make nice and lower their tariff rate.
  Or else. One economist called this “a global shakedown”. Many officials in
  Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada are no doubt seething. Trump seems to
  treat Washington’s trading partners as punching bags – that’s not a winning
  strategy for the US or the world. Another motivation behind Trump’s tariffs is
  his desire to erase the huge US trade deficit. That deficit has certainly been
  a problem, helping lead to myriad factory closings and job losses across
  blue-collar America. But even with its record trade deficits, the US has, by
  many measures, the world’s richest, most successful economy. Trump boasts that
  his tariffs are already bringing back some manufacturing – and there’s no
  denying that there are several examples, Last Wednesday, Apple vowed to invest
  $100bn in advanced manufacturing in the US, and GM plans to increase
  production of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks in Indiana while
  trimming output in Canada. Nonetheless, there’s a huge question mark as to
  whether Trump’s tariffs will inspire a major manufacturing rebound in the US.
  Many experts say the 15% tariffs imposed on the EU, Japan and other places are
  too low to persuade companies to move production to the US. For corporations
  to build a new $500m factory in the US, they will want solid assurances of
  what economic conditions will be four and five years from now. But does anyone
  actually think that the mercurial Mr Trump won’t issue new tariff threats or
  order tariff changes within four or five weeks? Perhaps the newspaper headline
  should be, “Trump Has Already Lost a Pivotal Part of His Trade War.” All the
  months of Trump’s on-again, off-again, up-and-down tariffs may mean he has so
  spooked and alienated corporate planners that he will never achieve his goal
  of bringing back far more factories, notwithstanding other countries’
  often-vague pledges of billions in investments. Even beyond that, in this age
  of AI, algorithms and a thriving service economy, it seems that Trump’s trade
  war – with the tremendous pain and disruption it is causing – might have made
  far more sense to help the economy of 50 or 75 years ago than the AI and
  information economy of today. Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author,
