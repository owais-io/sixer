  Straight Circle review – boisterous border guard satire from a director to
  watch
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-09-02T11:30:34Z'
bodyText: >-
  British documentary and ad director Oscar Hudson makes his feature debut in
  the Venice critics week sidebar with this high-concept anti-war satire, a
  through-the-looking-glass absurdist nightmare about realising that the
  otherness of your enemy is an illusion. There are some bold and ambitious
  images here, and some interesting split-screen work. Maybe there’s an issue
  about the style and substance ratio and perhaps the running time is indulgent,
  but this is a strong piece of work. Twins Elliott and Luke Tittensor play two
  soldiers of equal rank in opposing armies, called Pte Warne and Pte Arthur.
  They represent two nations of fictional Ruritanian weirdness, formerly at war
  but who have evidently concluded a tensely unstable peace treaty. Warne has a
  resplendent white uniform and, like the rest of his country, shaves his head,
  while Arthur has shaggy hair and a looser uniform. These two men have been
  chosen by their respective countries to be the sole guards at the border in
  the middle of a vast and featureless desert. They face off every day,
  notionally co-operating and sharing a station straddling the border, but
  suspicious, carrying out their various patriotic rituals to reassert their
  identity. It could be that Hudson was inspired by the elaborate Attari-Wagah
  border ceremony of India and Pakistan, a military ballet of mutual resentment
  that has recently become more acrimonious because of the issue of who gets to
  have the bigger flag. The peace process means that these two border guards
  must carry out their daily ceremonies with no one else to witness them, their
  commanding officers and civilian populations being many miles away. They are
  supplied with food and a large amount of live pigeons, a handful of which have
  to be released every day to symbolise peace. But when Arthur presumes to
  release a daily pigeon-batch on his own – they’re supposed to do it jointly –
  and moreover messes with the boiled eggs that Warne is cooking for his supper,
  relations between them become strained. They are in existential confrontation
  in the burning sun, they lose their bearings and a sense of what side of the
  border they’re on, and they are furthermore traumatised by the appearance of
  an Indigenous shepherd (played by Neil Maskell). He shows up like Pozzo
  without Lucky in Beckett’s Godot and the result of this encounter tips them
  into mutual breakdown. Which of them is which? They do, after all, have a
  great deal in common: chiefly an overbearing military father figure whose
  memory haunts each man. This is a boisterous, lively picture: I can imagine
  Richard Lester having directed it in 1968. Hudson will certainly have more to
  show us. • Straight Circle screened at the Venice film festival.
