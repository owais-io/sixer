  A “significant” jump in the cost of grocery staples such as eggs and butter is
  stoking food inflation, according to data pointing to a renewed cost of living
  squeeze. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said prices had risen at their
  fastest pace for 18 months, with food inflation hitting 4.2% this month. This
  was up from 4% in July and the highest reading since February 2024, according
  to its monthly shop price monitor. The BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson,
  said the rapid rise added to the pressure on people already struggling with
  the cost of living. “Staples such as butter and eggs saw significant increases
  due to high demand, tightening supply, and increased labour costs,” she said.
  “Chocolate also got more expensive as global prices of cocoa remain high owing
  to poor harvests.” The BRC also said that its data showed that overall shop
  price inflation increased to 0.9% in August, even as non-food products fell by
  0.8%. While shops were “doing everything they can to limit price rises for
  households”, Dickinson said, the industry faces £7bn in new costs after last
  year’s autumn budget, when Rachel Reeves introduced changes to employer
  national insurance contributions and the minimum wage. Last week more than 60
  retail bosses, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Boots, warned Reeves that
  increasing taxes further in the next autumn budget could contradict her plans
  to improve UK living standards. In a letter coordinated by the BRC, the bosses
  said they were expecting food inflation to hit 6% later this year. Mike
  Watkins, the head of retailer and business insight at NIQ, said that the
  uptick in prices also reflected other factors, including global supply costs,
  seasonal food inflation driven by the weather and the end of promotional deals
  linked to sporting events. “As shoppers return from their summer holidays,
  many may need to reassess household budgets in response to rising household
  bills,” Watkins added. Last week official figures showed that inflation rose
  again in July to a higher-than-expected 3.8%, partly driven by higher food
  prices and travel costs. The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the
  consumer prices index, climbed from 3.6% in June to sit above the Bank of
  England’s 2% target for the 10th consecutive month. Food and non-alcoholic
  beverages were up 4.9% year on year in July, the Office for National
  Statistics found, an increase from 4.5% in the 12 months to June. Beef, orange
  juice, coffee and chocolate were among the biggest risers. Droughts in Spain,
  Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources much of its fresh fruit and
  vegetables, have pushed up prices this summer, at a time when prices typically
  fall. Higher grocery prices come as households also brace for steeper energy
  bills, with the industry regulator for Great Britain due to announce a new
  price cap on Wednesday. Ofgem’s quarterly price cap is expected to rise by 1%
  in October, according to forecasts from Cornwall Insight, a leading energy
  consultancy. It has predicted Ofgem will increase the cap to £1,737 a year for
  a dual-fuel household, from the current level of £1,720. The rise would come
  into effect in October and remain in place until the end of the year.
  Charities have warned such a rise could mean millions of households will
  struggle to pay their energy bills. Simon Francis of the End Fuel Poverty
  Coalition said the average household was paying 67% more for their energy
  compared with the winter of 2020-21. The charity estimates that 12.1 million
  UK households are struggling with the cost of their energy bills and says they
  cannot shoulder any more price increases. “We are now approaching the fifth
  winter of the energy bills crisis and the time for tinkering with the price
  cap is over,” he said.
