  Plastics are a “grave, growing and under-recognised danger” to human and
  planetary health, a new expert review has warned. The world is in a “plastics
  crisis”, it concluded, which is causing disease and death from infancy to old
  age and is responsible for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related
  damages. The driver of the crisis is a huge acceleration of plastic
  production, which has increased by more than 200 times since 1950 and is set
  to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060. While
  plastic has many important uses, the most rapid increase has been in the
  production of single-use plastics, such as drinks bottles and fast-food
  containers. As a result, plastic pollution has also soared, with 8bn tonnes
  now polluting the entire planet, the review said, from the top of Mount
  Everest to the deepest ocean trench. Less than 10% of plastic is recycled.
  Plastics endangered people and the planet at every stage, the review said,
  from the extraction of the fossil fuels they were made from, to production,
  use and disposal. This results in air pollution, exposure to toxic chemicals
  and infiltration of the body with microplastics. Plastic pollution can even
  boost disease-carrying mosquitoes, as water captured in littered plastic
  provides good breeding sites. The review, published in the leading medical
  journal the Lancet, was released before the sixth and probably final round of
  negotiations between countries to agree a legally binding global plastics
  treaty to tackle the crisis. The talks have been dogged by a deep disagreement
  between more than 100 countries that back a cap on plastic production and
  petrostates such as Saudi Arabia that oppose the proposal. The Guardian
  recently revealed how petrostates and plastic industry lobbyists are derailing
  the negotiations. “We know a great deal about the range and severity of the
  health and environmental impacts of plastic pollution,” said Prof Philip
  Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in the US, and
  lead author of the new report. He said it was imperative the plastics treaty
  included measures to protect human and planetary health. “The impacts fall
  most heavily on vulnerable populations, especially infants and children,” he
  said. “They result in huge economic costs to society. It is incumbent on us to
  act in response.” Petrostates and the plastics industry have argued the focus
  should be on recycling plastic, not cutting production. But, unlike paper,
  glass, steel and aluminium, chemically complex plastics cannot be readily
  recycled. The report said: “It is now clear that the world cannot recycle its
  way out of the plastic pollution crisis.” More than 98% of plastics are made
  from fossil oil, gas and coal. The energy-intensive production process drives
  the climate crisis by releasing the equivalent of 2bn tonnes of CO2 a year –
  more than the emissions of Russia, the world’s fourth biggest polluter.
  Plastic production also produces air pollution, while more than half of
  unmanaged plastic waste was burned in the open air, further increasing dirty
  air, the report noted. More than 16,000 chemicals are used in plastics,
  including fillers, dyes, flame retardants and stabilisers. Many plastic
  chemicals were linked to health effects at all stages of human life, the
  report said, but there was a lack of transparency about which chemicals were
  present in plastics. The analysis found that foetuses, infants and young
  children were highly susceptible to the harms associated with plastics, with
  exposure associated with increased risks of miscarriage, premature and
  stillbirth, birth defects, impaired lung growth, childhood cancer and
  fertility problems later in life. Plastic waste often breaks down into micro-
  and nano-plastics which enter the human body via water, food and breathing.
  The particles have been found in blood, brains, breast milk, placentas, semen
  and bone marrow. Their impact on human health is largely unknown as yet, but
  they have been linked to strokes and heart attacks and the researchers said a
  precautionary approach was needed. Plastic is often seen as a cheap material
  but the scientists argue it is expensive when the cost of health damages are
  included. One estimate of the health damage from just three plastic chemicals
  – PBDE, BPA and DEHP – in 38 countries was $1.5tn a year. The new analysis is
  the start of a series of reports that will regularly track the impact of
  plastics. Margaret Spring, a senior lawyer and one of the report’s co-authors,
  said: “The reports will offer decision-makers around the world a robust and
  independent data source to inform the development of effective policies
  addressing plastic pollution at all levels.”
