  The title of Miranda Nation’s new mystery series, Playing Gracie Darling,
  reminded me of Donald Crombie’s 1986 adaptation of Playing Beatie Bow –
  another Australian production that links a young woman’s name with a
  children’s game that defies the seemingly immutable laws of the universe.
  Where Beatie Bow was transported from the past to modern Sydney via a chant,
  “playing Gracie Darling” involves youngsters communicating with the spirit
  world, where Darling may have been taken after a seance performed in a creaky
  old shack went terribly wrong. Because of course it does! It’s a seance. In a
  shack. Just once I’d love to see a “talk to the dead” scene involving Ouija
  boards and the like go swimmingly well, a bunch of spirit-communicators
  leaving the event with ear-to-ear smiles and newfound joie de vivre. But of
  course, the seance in this reasonably well-staged but very codified and
  derivative series involves the Ouija board catching on fire and the titular
  girl (Kristina Bogic) spitting out demonic-sounding dialogue, before
  disappearing from the face of the Earth in 1997. Jumping many years ahead, we
  follow Gracie’s former bestie Joni (Morgana O’Reilly), who attended the seance
  and is now a child psychologist. In the first episode (this review encompasses
  the first three of six – all that was made available to the media) Joni
  receives a phone call, informing her that another girl has gone missing from
  that very same shack, where a bunch of kids were playing Gracie Darling. Ah
  yes, the past comes back to haunt! This moment establishes the show’s very
  genre-ified dialogue, via lines such as “It’s happening again”. Similarly
  tired-sounding language is sprinkled by the writers (Nation and Anya
  Beyersdorf) throughout the series and delivered by the poker-faced cast. Sign
  up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for
  the weekend, every Saturday morning Occult activities becoming a form of
  adolescent recreation thematically aligns this show with Danny and Michael
  Philippou’s excellent horror film Talk To Me, in which teenagers pass around
  an embalmed severed hand and channel a cranky spirit. But the Philippou
  brothers did something interesting by associating occult practices with other
  forms of recreational risk-taking, implying that consulting spirits and taking
  hits from a bong are different forms of the same ancient desire: to transcend
  the realm of the ordinary (which is exactly what I told my mother when she
  caught me smoking pot as a teenager). In Playing Gracie Darling, the occult
  element just feels cribbed from a cobweb-covered playbook. Likewise for the
  correlation between a core mystery and the troubled past of the protagonist,
  who, in order to fix a contemporary problem, must address something unresolved
  inside themselves – an oldie but a goodie. Another key player is local cop Jay
  (Rudi Dharmalingam, from the ABC’s sublime drama Wakefield), who was also part
  of that seance – because small town, because narratively convenient. The
  supporting cast also includes Dame Harriet Walter as Joni’s mum, Pattie, and
  Celia Pacquola as Ruth Darling, whose daughter Frankie is the latest person to
  disappear. Another very familiar element in this show concerns a situation
  brewing in the background that affects the local community, which serves as a
  scaffold for the main plot. Recently, in Last Days of the Space Age, there was
  an ongoing workers dispute at a power plant, and in The Family Next Door, a
  controversial real estate property development. Here, it’s some recently
  constructed wind turbines which are disrupting the flight paths of birds and –
  some citizens believe – triggering health issues in the local community.
  Atmospherically, Playing Gracie Darling is directed assuredly by Jonathan
  Brough (whose recent work includes Bay of Fires, Rosehaven and The End). And
  it is quite well acted, with a particularly strong, grounding lead performance
  from Morgana O’Reilly, who had a small but memorable role as a hotel employee
  in The White Lotus season three. But the writing in this series comes across
  as very self-conscious and overall the show feels fusty and antiquated.
  Playing Gracie Darling is on Paramount+ now.
