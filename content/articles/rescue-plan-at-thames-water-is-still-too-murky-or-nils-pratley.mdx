  The wannabe new owners of Thames Water say they are “fully committed to a new
  transparent and collaborative relationship with regulators”. Jolly good.
  Unfortunately, this embrace of transparency does not appear to extend to the
  poor old customers. At this late stage in the dance to decide Thames’s future,
  you’d expect London &amp; Valley Water – the banner under which the consortium
  of creditors now sail – to opt for straight-talking and openness. Their pitch
  to rescue Thames, after all, rests on the analysis that they are the folk to
  inject the necessary pragmatism into a company that has lived a hand-to-mouth
  existence for years while promoting fantasy turnaround plans. So how, the
  customers will want to know, do the consortium’s supposedly “realistic”
  performance targets measure up against the “unrealistic” ones that were set
  last December under Ofwat’s final determination? Surely it should be a simple
  matter to say which have been downgraded and delayed, and which may even have
  been upgraded or accelerated. There was little of that sort in the
  consortium’s breezy description of its plan this week. Instead, there were a
  handful of selected highlights – 135 fewer pollution incidents a year! 2,500km
  of sewers to be cleaned! – without saying how the figures and budget
  allocations differ from previous expectations. The details matter because, as
  the consortium accepts, Thames will have £20.5bn from customers’ bills to use
  over the 2025-30 period, rather than the £24bn that the company originally
  sought. An exercise in prioritisation was therefore inevitable; and, yes, some
  of the consortium’s choices sound sensible. If 14% of serious pollution
  incidents at Thames are caused by power failures, then it’s logical to invest
  in resilient kit as soon as possible. But not everything, obviously, can be a
  priority. You also have to tell the customers which spending targets have been
  de-prioritised and which environmental projects you would cut. Equally, it is
  infuriating to hear yet again about the “billions of pounds of new funding”
  the consortium is prepared to put into Thames if its plan is signed off by
  Ofwat and the courts and gets a thumbs up from the government. Come on, the
  sum always had to be billions because Thames is in a very deep hole; the
  question is how many billions. The other burning (and related) issue is the
  size of haircuts on the £16bn of senior debt held by the creditors. At the
  last outing in June, their numbers implied that they were volunteering for 20%
  write-downs, a level that was plainly inadequate, as argued here at the time.
  It was too greedy. Even now, though – a full three months later – there is no
  hint of a better offer to strengthen the balance sheet. Being generous, one
  could say that the operational plan, the upfront funding, the haircuts and the
  governance setup can only be thrashed out between the consortium and Ofwat
  over the next few weeks, and that it would be mad to put the full version on
  display when the process could still fall apart. But remember this exercise is
  running to an unofficial deadline of 22 October, the last day Thames can
  appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority for a review of Ofwat’s
  December determination. One does not have to be too cynical to think the tight
  timetable serves the creditors’ interests if this saga ends in an
  eleventh-hour showdown between the creditors and government to agree a
  “market-led” solution to keep Thames out of special administration. The most
  important missing element in this standoff is the one that is surely of most
  interest to the 16 million customers: the likely regulatory compromises on
  service standards and penalties. The way this is saga is going, the details
  will emerge only after it is too late for outside scrutiny. The lack of
  transparency is appalling.
