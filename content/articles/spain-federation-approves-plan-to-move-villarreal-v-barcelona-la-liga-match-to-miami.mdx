  Barcelona and Villarreal could be set to contest the first European league
  match held in the United States after the Spanish football federation (RFEF)
  approved a La Liga plan to hold one of the teams’ games this season in Miami,
  Florida. La Liga proposed the measure to the RFEF on Monday. With the RFEF’s
  approval, the matter now requires the approval of Fifa, Uefa, and the host
  federation and confederation (US Soccer and Concacaf, respectively). The match
  in question was due to be played at Villarreal’s home ground, the Estadio de
  la Cerámica, on 21 December. The proposed moving of the fixture will bring it
  to Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins are due
  to host the Cincinnati Bengals at Hard Rock Stadium on 21 December, so it’s
  likely that the date of the La Liga fixture will need to be moved. The plan
  was made possible by the dismissal of the lawsuit brought by Relevent Sports,
  a US-based events promoter, against Fifa and the US Soccer Federation.
  Notably, Relevent was founded and is owned by Stephen Ross, a real estate
  developer and the owner of the Dolphins and Hard Rock Stadium. Relevent had
  initially sued Fifa and US Soccer in 2019 after attempting to hold a La Liga
  match in Miami the previous year – a proposal that US Soccer refused to
  sanction on account of a Fifa statute barring domestic league games from
  taking place away from their home territory. Relevent sued, contending the
  policy violated the United States’ Sherman Antitrust Act – an 1890 piece of
  legislation designed to combat monopolies. Fifa and Relevent eventually
  settled their case with the understanding that Fifa would revisit the statute.
  The sides settled the case without prejudice, allowing Relevent the option of
  reopening litigation. Relevent made its name by hosting a number of pre-season
  events in the US featuring big-name European clubs. This year the organization
  signed a six-season deal with Uefa to be its global marketing and sales
  partner for men’s club competitions, giving it the ability to sell rights to
  the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.
