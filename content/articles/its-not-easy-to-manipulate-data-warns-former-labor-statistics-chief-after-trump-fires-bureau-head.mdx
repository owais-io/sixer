  Donald Trump will need to take more radical action than simply firing the head
  of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) if he is determined to “cook the
  books” on jobs figures, the federal agency’s former commissioner has said.
  Erica Groshen, who ran the BLS during Barack Obama’s presidency, said meddling
  with how government statisticians calculate unemployment and labour market
  trends would require “a whole new cadre” of people to be brought in by a new
  commissioner. It would also provoke upheaval and a likely rash of
  whistle-blowing among the existing workforce. Trump provoked widespread
  criticism last week by firing the BLS’s commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after
  weaker-than-expected jobs numbers for July and downward revisions for the two
  previous months, statistics that seemed to portend a looming economic
  slowdown. Without providing evidence, Trump accused McEntarfer, who was
  confirmed by the Senate last year, of producing “fake” numbers for “political
  purposes”. He also falsely stated that she had “produced beautiful numbers” on
  jobs for Kamala Harris before last year’s presidential election. In fact, the
  BLS jobs report four days before last November’s poll showed the economy had
  added just 12,000 jobs in the previous month, something Trump at the time
  branded a “catastrophe”. In an interview, Groshen said Trump’s reasoning for
  terminating McEntarfer had “no basis at all”. She said the decision was “very
  shocking” despite having warned of such a possibility earlier this year in a
  briefing paper that flagged up changes in civil service employment
  classifications under Trump, which make it easer to fire senior officials
  deemed out of step with the president’s agenda. “This isn’t inconsistent with
  the way he’s acted in other situations,” she said. “[But] it’s a question of
  boundaries. I had quietly hoped and assumed it wouldn’t happen. “I think it’s
  disastrous for the statistical system and for the BLS.” The episode has
  provoked equally apocalyptic warnings from seasoned commentators. Thomas
  Friedman, a New York Times columnist, called it “the most dangerous” thing
  Trump had said or done and expressed fears that “the America you know will be
  gone” by the end of the president’s term. Janet Yellen, the former treasury
  secretary, called it “the kind of thing you would only expect to see in a
  banana republic”. Writing on Substack, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian of
  authoritarian political systems, invoked, among other examples, fascist Italy
  where, she wrote, Mussolini “pioneered the politicization of economic
  research” for the “glorification” of his dictatorship. The stakes for
  projecting economic competence were higher, she wrote, for leaders “in today’s
  age of electoral autocracies” – a term used to describe ostensible democracies
  with entrenched authoritarian leaders and which Trump’s detractors believe is
  his ideal model for the US. Yet Groshen – who condemned McEntarfer’s sacking
  in her role as co-chair of Friends of BLS, a group of former agency veterans –
  said the White House would have an uphill task if its goal was to skew
  official data-gathering in the manner of contemporary autocracies, or Greece
  and Argentina, where government statistical agencies were exposed for
  falsifying data, with profound economic and political consequences. “The only
  gratifying thing about this has been the very strong response from all sorts
  of communities, raising alarm about it now that it has happened,” she said. In
  the short-term, nothing at the BLS is likely to change, she said: “Bill
  Wiatrowski is a BLS lifer. I appointed him as acting deputy commissioner. He’s
  a steady hand and the operations of the BLS will continue as before.” The acid
  test, Groshen said, will come when Trump nominates McEntarfer’s permanent
  successor. But even a like-minded appointee committed to the president’s Maga
  agenda will not be able, on their own, to transform the agency into a
  malleable puppet body. “It would not be easy to start injecting a partisan
  slant, [or] start manipulating the data,” Groshen said. “This is a very
  automated process that is designed to be impervious to manipulation. The whole
  structure of how data are analyzed, and the process from the analysis of the
  data to the release [of figures] would have to be redesigned. “They would need
  to bring in with them a cadre of other like minded people, and then they would
  have to start changing the process. The career civil servants, I have no
  doubt, would resist that and make strong arguments against it. “If
  nevertheless they persisted, you would have resignations, whistle-blowing. You
  would see disruptions of the sort that BLS doesn’t normally have. You would
  have changes in methodology that were not announced beforehand and without any
  documentation and the kind of transparency that statistical agencies are
  required to have. There probably would be delays in publication, because it’s
  very hard to reprogram these systems overnight. “This isn’t just [a case of
  only ] one or two people would notice. This would pervade the system.” Those
  ostensibly daunting obstacles raise the possibility of Trump backing away from
  a maximalist effort to bend the BLS to his will. “I would have said that some
  of the other changes in our government couldn’t happen, yet they have. So am I
  worried about it? Yes,” said Groshen, now affiliated with Cornell University
  as a specialist in government statistics. “Nevertheless, the outcry that we’ve
  seen so far about the firing of the BLS commissioner gives me hope that even
  this administration won’t go that far.” The best-case scenario, she says,
  would be for the administration to step back from the brink, appoint someone
  “whose reputation is stellar”, and maintain the agency on its current
  autonomous and impartial lines, with extra funding. Greater financial support
  could even help address whatever legitimacy criticism Trump and his supporters
  might have. “The little bit of truth in those accusations is that the
  statistics are not perfect and not as good as they could be,” said Groshen.
  “What is not true is that they’re manipulated and the implication that the
  headline numbers, the national numbers, are much less reliable than before.”
  The biggest problem the agency faces is falling response rates from employers
  and other bodies – meaning estimate figures often have to be drastically
  revised at a later stage, the quirk that upset Trump and partially prompted
  McEntarfer’s sacking. Hope that Trump might choose a pragmatic course was
  fueled by criticism of McEntarfer’s axing from three Republican senators: Rand
  Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming.
  Yet the possibility that he may adopt a bludgeon response to unwelcome
  economic numbers remains high. There have been reports of altered or removed
  data at the Department of Health and Human Services under Robert F Kennedy
  Jr’s stewardship. The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has previously
  talked of changing how gross domestic product (GDP) is measured, leading to
  fears of interference at another statistical agency, the Bureau of Economic
  Analysis. And on Thursday, Trump announced that he had ordered the commerce
  department to conduct a new census that would exclude undocumented people, a
  sharp break with historic US practice of counting all residents. If that is
  the shape of things to come for the BLS – a subdivision of the Department of
  Labor, which has been producing labor and job market statistics since 1884 –
  the worst forebodings of Trump’s critics will be realized, Groshen said. “If
  data from the BLS and the other statistical units across the federal
  government becomes less reliable, we won’t be in as bad shape as we were in,
  say, 1900,” she said. “But we’re going to have a cloudier windshield as we fly
  our national plane or drive our national car – so we will make more mistakes,
  at policy level, business level and family level.”
