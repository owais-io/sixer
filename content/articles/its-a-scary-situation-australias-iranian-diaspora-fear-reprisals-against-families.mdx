  Iranian Australians have welcomed the expulsion of Iran’s ambassador to
  Australia even as some raised concerns that the move could leave family
  members stranded in Iran. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the
  expulsion on Tuesday, saying the Australian Security and Intelligence
  Organisation (Asio) had “credible intelligence” to determine the Iranian
  government was behind the attacks against the Adass Israel synagogue in
  Melbourne and Lewis’s Continental Kitchen in Bondi in Sydney. Mike Burgess,
  head of Asio, said the attacks had been ordered by Iran’s Islamic
  Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which would now be listed as a terrorist
  organisation, with new laws to be considered by federal parliament. The
  diplomatic action, praised by Australia’s Jewish community, may also impact
  the ability of Iranians to visit Australia, a migration agent warned. Albanese
  on Tuesday told reporters Australian embassy staff had been rushed out of the
  country. Operations have been suspended at Australia’s embassy in Tehran. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email Suren Edgar, vice president of the Australia
  Iranian Community Alliance (AICA), said the decision marked a long-overdue
  turning point in the relationship between Australia and the Islamic Republic.
  “The prime minister’s remarks confirm what AICA, Iranian dissidents,
  intelligence agencies, security experts, journalists, and average Australians,
  indeed, every Dick, Tom, and Harry, have been warning about for years,” he
  said. “Let us be clear: this is not a diplomatic disagreement with a sovereign
  nation. This is a countermeasure against a transnational criminal enterprise
  that has hijacked a country, plundered its resources, destabilised a region,
  and targeted innocent lives globally – including here in Australia.” Community
  members told an Australian Senate inquiry in 2022 how IRGC officers had
  questioned and threatened their families in Iran, but the inquiry’s
  recommendation to designate the IRGC as a terror group was not adopted until
  Tuesday. But Mohammad Reza Azimi, a Sydney-based migration agent, warned the
  ambassador’s expulsion risked thousands of Australians being cut off from
  their families. “All these people, very happy today, they’re going to ...
  raise up these problems: my father cannot come, I can’t bring my partner [to
  Australia],” Azimi said. “They have parents, they have brothers, they have
  sisters back in Iran. If there is no embassy, how are they going to get their
  passport sorted?” he said. More than 90,000 Australian residents were born in
  Iran, one in seven of whom arrived within the last five years through the
  skills-focused permanent migration program. Many hopeful migrants could be
  prevented from entering Australia due to the IRGC’s designation as a terrorist
  organisation, Azimi warned. Iranian men are required to serve in the Iranian
  army or the IRGC. The latter’s designation as a terrorist organisation by the
  US has left IRGC conscripts ineligible for US immigrant visas. Azimi, who
  served a compulsory term in the IRGC three decades ago and moved to Australia
  10 years later, said genuine skilled migrants who were conscripted may be
  deemed ineligible to enter Australia. “They might not be able to pass the
  character test for the visa, which I hope the government is not considering,”
  Azimi said. “It’s going to jeopardise the applications from many Iranians.”
  The Department of Home Affairs referred questions over Iranian embassy access
  to the Iranian government and declined to directly clarify how visa
  applications would be impacted. Penny Wong, the foreign affairs minister, on
  Tuesday urged the many Australians with family connections to Iran not to
  travel to Iran, if they had plans to do so. Wong also urged Australians to
  leave Iran. Australians in Iran face “high risk of arbitrary detention or
  arrest” and cannot be guaranteed consular support or legal representation,
  according to the Smartraveller website. Rana Dadpour, an anti-Islamic Republic
  advocate in Australia, said many in the local community had long been
  concerned for their family members in Iran. “We have already seen many of us,
  our parents, our brothers and sisters have been harassed or intimidated ... so
  this is something we are very familiar with,” she said. “We never expected it
  to happen … there was a hopeless, helpless feeling in the community and
  suddenly it disappeared,” Dadpour said. “I’ve just received so many calls and
  messages from my friends and people in the community here in Australia,
  everyone’s screaming, their hard work has paid off and they have been listened
  to.” But others feared their relatives in Iran might be put at risk by having
  connections to Australia. Sam, 34, an Australian business owner from Western
  Australia whose name has been changed to protect his family’s identity, said
  he was concerned about his mother and six siblings who live in Iran after
  fleeing Afghanistan. “I’m so worried now. The [IRGC] can easily target people
  who have Australian connections. They know where our family lives, they know
  when we visit them,” he said. Sam was in Iran when Israel began its
  bombardment in June and at the time was forced to give his family’s details,
  including their addresses, to local police, he said. He has applied for
  Australian humanitarian visas for his relatives. “They’re living in a very
  scary situation,” he said.
