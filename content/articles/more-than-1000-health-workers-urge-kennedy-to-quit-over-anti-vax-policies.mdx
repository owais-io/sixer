  A letter published on Wednesday from more than 1,000 past and present workers
  of the Department of Health and Human Services department (HHS) has demanded
  the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr, insisting the health secretary’s
  attacks on vaccines endangered the lives of all Americans. The hard-hitting
  letter, addressed to Congress members, blames Kennedy for turmoil at the
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of the
  agency’s chief and replacement by a Donald Trump loyalist with no medical or
  scientific background. It comes two days after nine former CDC officials wrote
  in a New York Times guest essay that Kennedy’s leadership, and ousting of the
  CDC director, Susan Monarez, months after he appointed her, was “unacceptable”
  and “unlike anything we have ever seen”. The letter posted on Wednesday by a
  group calling itself Save HHS assails Kennedy for “endangering the nation’s
  health by spreading inaccurate health information”. It cites the resignations
  of other leading health officials, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of
  the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Daniel
  Jernigan, the agency’s director for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases;
  and Debra Houry, its chief medical officer. It also offers sharp criticism of
  Kennedy’s installation of “political ideologues who pose as scientific
  experts” in leading roles, including on a key vaccine advisory panel. Several
  members have touted discredited theories, such as the long-disproven link
  between vaccines and autism. Earlier this week, the US Food and Drug
  Administration (FDA) severely restricted who could get updated Covid-19
  vaccines, with Kennedy posting to social media that coronavirus “mandates”
  from the Biden administration were rescinded and that vaccines would be
  available only to those at highest risk. “Our oath requires us to speak out
  when the constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,”
  the letter, co-signed by six partner organizations in the medical field, said.
  “We warn the president, Congress and the public that Secretary Kennedy’s
  actions are compromising the health of this nation, and we demand Secretary
  Kennedy’s resignation.” It calls for Trump to appoint a new health secretary
  “whose qualifications and experience ensure that health policy is informed by
  independent and unbiased peer-reviewed science”. Trump this week expressed his
  displeasure at the chaos engulfing the CDC, acknowledging in a social media
  post that the agency was being “ripped apart” by the vaccines controversy. But
  he claimed drug manufacturers were to blame for allegedly not revealing
  publicly “the success or failure” of Covid vaccines. The Trump administration
  also previously sided with Kennedy over Monarez’s firing, which prompted
  bipartisan pushback and a walkout of dozens of CDC staff last month. Monarez,
  a long-serving government expert on infectious diseases, was confirmed in
  July, but fired because she was “not aligned with the president’s agenda”, a
  White House statement said. The 1,040 former and current HHS employees who
  signed Wednesday’s letter said they were writing again because Kennedy ignored
  their earlier communication. A statement issued by HHS accused the group of
  “an attempt to politicize a tragedy” by claiming Kennedy’s vaccine rhetoric
  played a role in an attack on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on 8 August in
  which a police officer was killed. In its new letter, the group said that the
  HHS workforce is non-partisan, “implementing science-based policies developed
  under both Republican and Democratic administrations”. It said: “We believe
  health policy should be based on strong, evidence-based principles rather than
  partisan politics. But under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, HHS policies are
  placing the health of all Americans at risk, regardless of their politics.” In
  a statement, the HHS communications director, Andrew Nixon, said: “Secretary
  Kennedy has been clear: the CDC has been broken for a long time. Restoring it
  as the world’s most trusted guardian of public health will take sustained
  reform and more personnel changes. “From his first day in office, he pledged
  to check his assumptions at the door – and he asked every HHS colleague to do
  the same. That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven
  months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary
  in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America
  Healthy Again.” The HHS employees signed their letter “in our own personal
  capacities, on our personal time, and without the use of government
  equipment”. It said “countless others” across HHS shared their concerns but
  “chose not to sign out of well-founded fear of retaliation and threats to
  personal safety”. Up to 30 workers at the Federal Emergency Management Agency
  (Fema) were placed on leave last week after they publicly signed a letter of
  dissent over Trump’s dismantling of the agency and fears it would lead to a
  disaster like Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
