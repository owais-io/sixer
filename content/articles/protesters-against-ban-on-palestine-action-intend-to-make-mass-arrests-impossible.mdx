  Protesters at the next mass demonstration against the ban on Palestine Action
  will withhold their details from officers to force en-masse processing at
  police stations in an effort to make it “practically impossible” to arrest
  everyone. On Friday, Defend Our Juries, the pressure group behind the
  protests, will open sign-ups for its next demonstration to be held in London
  on 6 September. The group said it would only go ahead if 1,000 people agreed
  to take part, making it the largest protest opposing the proscription of
  Palestine Action since it was banned in June. More than 2,500 people have
  already expressed interest in taking part. Earlier this month, 532 people were
  arrested at the largest demonstration so far relating to Palestine Action
  since it was proscribed. The Met said 212 of those arrested were transported
  to police stations after either refusing to provide their details or having
  been found to already be on bail. The remaining 320 were arrested and released
  on bail after giving their details to officers at makeshift processing points
  near Parliament Square. The force said it did not need to use any stations
  outside London. People who officially join will be asked to sign an online
  pledge that says: “I am committed to attending the mass-participation
  sign-holding action on 6 September 2025” and “I understand that joining this
  action comes with risk of arrest and other legal consequences.” They will also
  be asked to confirm they have read an action document that advises protesters
  not to comply with the “charade” of street bail, where people are processed on
  the side of the road, bailed and told to attend a police station on another
  day after handing over their details and ID. Instead, it is instructing
  participants not to provide any details, which means officers will have to
  transport them to a police station in order to carry out the arrest. In a
  briefing to be given to those who commit to attending, participants will be
  told that “had more people insisted on the right to be taken to a police
  station, which ensures the provision of immediate legal advice, the police
  would not have been able to complete so many arrests”. Tim Crosland, a
  spokesperson for Defend Our Juries, said: “The police were only able to arrest
  as many people as they did because of their trick of using ‘street bail’ on a
  mass scale, meaning people arrested of terrorism offences were denied the free
  legal advice they are entitled to when taken to a police station. “If 1,000
  people sign the pledge to take part on 6 September, ensuring we have the
  critical mass we need for the action, and hundreds of them insist on their
  right to receive immediate free legal advice at a police station, the charade
  will be exposed. “It will be practically impossible for the police to arrest
  1,000 people taking part. Any law that is so obviously wrong that it meets
  mass public opposition quickly becomes unenforceable, as it was with the poll
  tax in 1990, and the government will have to scrap it.” The most recent
  demonstration was planned to last for an hour but Defend Our Juries said next
  month’s protest will last indefinitely. The briefing given to pledgees will
  say “for as long as police are arresting people, we ask you to remain in
  place, until arrested, to maintain the collectivity of the group … Please come
  prepared to stay for as long as it takes.” On Monday, a poll carried out by
  Survation for LabourList found seven in 10 Labour members believed the
  government was wrong to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist group. The
  direct action group was proscribed after activists broke into RAF Brize Norton
  and defaced two military aircraft with spray paint. Last week, the former
  cabinet minister Peter Hain said the UK government was “digging itself into a
  hole” over Palestine Action and that fellow Labour peers and MPs were
  regretting voting to ban the group. He was one of three Labour members of the
  Lords to vote against banning the group in July. Hain co-wrote a piece for the
  Guardian on Monday with the Labour MP Stella Creasy, who had voted in favour
  of banning the group. They said they “both agree what is happening now neither
  protects protest nor makes protest policeable”. Crosland said: “The
  government’s monumental waste of policing resources to criminalise cardboard
  sign-holding against genocide has already been widely condemned by politicians
  and public figures across the political spectrum. Now the Labour party has
  turned against the ban, with more than 70% of its members opposed to it, and
  MPs are claiming to have been tricked by [Yvette] Cooper.”
