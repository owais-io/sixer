  Wars do not have to be won. Total victories loom largest in the popular
  imagination because those are the stories nations always tell to sustain
  patriotic feeling. The fuller version of history is written in stalemates.
  That is worth remembering when Donald Trump meets Vladimir Putin in Alaska on
  Friday. Both leaders have incentives to pretend that Ukraine’s fate can be
  settled decisively without any Ukrainians at the negotiating table. That
  doesn’t make it so. For the US president, this is a project of personal
  vanity. He promised to end the war within days of returning to the White
  House. The persistence of hostilities seven months after his inauguration is a
  rebuke to his self-image as the world’s master dealmaker. Putin also once
  thought the war could be concluded swiftly. He launched his all-out invasion
  in February 2022 expecting Kyiv to fall within weeks. When Ukrainian
  resistance thwarted that plan, the Russian president switched to a long game
  of attrition, relying on superior troop numbers and aerial bombardment to
  degrade Ukraine’s viability as a sovereign state. Russia’s industrial base and
  public opinion have been fired up for perpetual war. Kremlin propagandists
  boast of the nation’s limitless military stamina, while Russian commanders
  keep promising to break through enemy lines and initiate the long-awaited
  capitulation. Putin has to believe in the inevitability of Ukrainian defeat
  because any other scenario – even a ceasefire that allows him to hold
  territory captured so far – leaves the historic mission he set himself
  unfulfilled. He will harbour a vengeful grievance for as long as Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy is president of a country that is free to arm itself and pursue an
  independent policy of integration with other European democracies. Any border
  or treaty that prevents the Kremlin dictating Ukraine’s strategic orientation
  is illegitimate in Putin’s eyes. That won’t prevent him signing bits of paper
  as a tactical expedient. The Russian president recognises that he has tested
  his American counterpart’s patience. He has lost ground to Zelenskyy in the
  competition to shape Trump’s explanation for why the war persists when he has
  called for peace. The Ukrainian president has bounced back from his televised
  humiliation in the White House in February, when he was harangued for
  ingratitude and blamed for inciting the invasion of his own country. Deft
  diplomacy, underwritten by Nato leaders pledging to pay Kyiv’s military bills,
  bought a sliver of recognition from Trump that maybe things were more
  complicated than previously thought; that Putin was prone to “bullshit”; that
  his professed interest in peace was contradicted by the volume of bombs he
  kept dropping on Ukrainian civilians. The Alaska powwow is happening because
  Trump started setting ceasefire deadlines and threatening Moscow with
  sanctions. Putin needed to offer some affectation of willingness to
  compromise. He calculated that the spectacle of a summit, combined with some
  artfully ambiguous signals around “land swaps”, would appeal to Trump’s
  confidence in his own charisma and his belief that a deal is there for the
  doing. Putin will use the encounter to frame the conflict in terms that chime
  with Trump’s warped and historically illiterate reading of the story. It is
  the version in which a devious, criminal Zelenskyy bamboozles a senescent Joe
  Biden into throwing away heaps of US treasure on a crazy, losing bet. The war
  is nearly won anyway, Putin will say. Ukraine cannot prevail, but can sucker
  its allies into throwing good money after bad. He will outline a future of
  lucrative commercial relations between two great powers whose potential
  friendship has been sabotaged by a roguish European province that hardly even
  counts as a proper country. He will make grotesque territorial claims,
  covering places not yet conquered by Russian troops, and present this as the
  bare minimum of a reasonable allocation of land to Moscow. He will insist on
  Ukrainian “demilitarisation” – in effect guaranteeing the country’s
  vulnerability to some future incursion – and call it essential for the sake of
  Russian security. We know these are the demands because Putin has been making
  them for months. He restated them earlier this month. Trump doesn’t have to
  fall in a bromantic swoon at Putin’s feet to make the summit a success for
  Russia. The damage will be done if he emerges from negotiations parroting
  talking points from the Kremlin script. The fear among Ukraine’s European
  allies is that he will proudly outline a ceasefire proposal on terms that
  Zelenskyy cannot possibly accept – an unjust, unworkable partition of his
  country along lines drawn by the tyrant who invaded it. Putin will then claim
  that he tried to talk peace and only Ukrainian intransigence prolongs the war.
  Less bleak scenarios are conceivable. Trump’s newfound scepticism about Putin
  might withstand corrosion by flattery. The Russian leader’s confidence in an
  imminent battlefield breakthrough might prove misplaced – a symptom of the
  brittle, authoritarian ego that only gives audience to sycophants bearing good
  tidings. He might be overestimating Russia’s economic resilience against
  sanctions. He might one day find ordinary Russians losing the will to
  sacrifice a generation of young men for a goal of national redemption that
  keeps receding over the horizon. When the domestic economic and political
  incentives change, Putin will get serious about a ceasefire. The task of
  Ukraine’s allies is to hasten that moment by sustaining maximum military aid
  to Kyiv and financial pressure on Moscow. Even then, a settlement would
  realistically leave some Ukrainian land under de facto permanent Russian
  occupation, behind heavily fortified lines. It will be a stalemate backed with
  sufficient deterrents to turn a hot war cold. It could end up looking
  something like the demilitarised zone on the Korean peninsula, separating two
  sides that are technically still at war, although the armistice was signed in
  1953. For now, the challenge for Zelenskyy and his allies is handling a US
  president who talks about war and peace in terms detached from any moral,
  historical or strategic context. Trump draws no meaningful distinction between
  a settlement that allows Ukraine to thrive as an independent state and one
  that satisfies the appetite of a Russian president bent on conquest. He values
  two kinds of deal – those that make him richer, and those that allow him to
  luxuriate in the status of a great dealmaker. If he thinks such benefits are
  available by abandoning American allies and interests there is no reason to
  think he wouldn’t do it. That will be Putin’s aim in Alaska. He has no
  intention of ending the war just because the White House demands it, but he
  knows he must pretend to want peace. And he knows his best hope of defeating
  Ukraine is to manipulate Trump into bullying Kyiv towards capitulation, while
  imagining that his own humiliation at Kremlin hands is some kind of personal
  victory. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist
