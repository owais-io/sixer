  Mare’s Nest review – an opaque, challenging reflection on the end of the
  world

bodyText: >-
  English experimentalist Ben Rivers offers up another challenging, intriguing
  cine-poem, this time on the nature of existence and the end of the world. It
  is opaque but with flashes of strange brilliance, an adaptation of The Word
  for Snow, a one-act stage play by Don DeLillo from 2007 that reflected on the
  climate crisis. A child called Moon (Moon Guo Barker) wanders around a strange
  world, entirely peopled by other children, except for one eerie monochrome
  sequence in which Moon sees adult figures in some kind of underground tunnel,
  frozen in attitudes of dismay similar to the citizenry of Pompeii. In the
  course of her travels, bookended by clambering out of a crashed car and
  finally driving happily off, Moon has dreamlike encounters with these children
  who speak with the tongues of adult prophets. She also exchanges pungent and
  often memorable micro-insights or haikus or aperçus about the nature of
  humanity in this postapocalyptic world. “The word for snow will be the snow,”
  says one, evidently foreseeing a time when language itself will be scorched
  away by some cosmic fatality. The scenario is not entirely unlike the
  super-rich Wall Street trader cruising affectlessly around the Manhattan
  streets in his stretch limo in DeLillo’s novella Cosmopolis, exchanging gnomic
  dialogue with the people in his life; this was filmed by David Cronenberg with
  Robert Pattinson in the lead role. Moon meets three weird child sisters, like
  something from Shakespeare, and then a child scholar whose words are
  interpreted by a child translator; she is met by various other infant devils
  or angels or lost souls. There is also a scene in which a Minotaur figure
  roams a maze, filmed in the (rather amazing) Lithica labyrinth in Menorca,
  Spain, a colossal stone land artwork. At one stage, Rivers’s camera locates a
  gravestone with a single handprint, as if humanity has found a primitive,
  wordless way of commemorating its own demise. The film is like a slo-mo Lord
  of the Flies (but without the violence) in a style not far from Pasolini’s
  ancient Greek dramas, and its uncanny quality creeps up on you. This applies
  even (or especially) to the dialogue put in the mouths of the children, which
  although occasionally stilted, has its own unearthly, somnambulist ring, as if
  an alien intelligence is ventriloquising its views through these innocents. Is
  all this a “mare’s nest”, in the sense of it being a complicated situation in
  which an illusory or misleading significance is to be found? Perhaps. In any
  event, Rivers has an ancient-mariner confidence in his stern, enigmatic
  address to the audience. • Mare’s Nest screened at the Locarno film festival
