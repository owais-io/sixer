  Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko were involved in a heated exchange at the
  end of their second-round match on Wednesday at the US Open. The two met at
  the net for post-match handshakes after Townsend had completed a 7-5, 6-1
  victory. But instead of heading to the locker rooms, they exchanged words and
  Ostapenko wagged her finger at her American opponent. The home crowd appeared
  to get behind Townsend and she approached the stands spurring them on as the
  noise rose on Court 11. After the match, Ostapenko said in an Instagram story
  that she had been unhappy with Townsend’s conduct before and during her
  victory. “Today after the match I told my opponent that she was very
  disrespectful as she had a net ball in a very deciding [moment] and didn’t say
  [sorry], but her answer was that she doesn’t have to say sorry at all,”
  Ostapenko said. “There are some rules in tennis which most of the players
  follow and it was first time ever that this happened to me on tour. If she
  plays in her homeland it doesn’t mean that she can behave and do whatever she
  wants.” She added: “In the beginning of the match all players are supposed to
  start warm up on the baseline. The opponent came out and straight away started
  the warm up at then which is very disrespectful and against the rules of a
  tennis match.” For her part, Townsend said Ostapenko had insulted her at the
  post-match handshake. “She told me I have no class, no education, and to see
  what happens when we get outside the US,” Townsend said. “I’m looking forward
  to it. I beat her in Canada outside the US. So let’s see what else she has to
  say.” Townsend, a world No 1 in doubles but currently ranked outside the top
  100 in singles, suggested the No 25 seed Ostapenko was angry at the upset. “I
  mean, it’s competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.” In
  her post-match press conference Townsend, who is Black, would not be drawn on
  whether there was a racial component to Ostapenko’s comments. “That’s
  something you’re going to have to ask her,” said Townsend. “I didn’t take it
  in that way but also that has been a stigma in [the Black] community of being
  not educated ... when it’s the furthest thing from the truth. So whether it
  had racial undertones or not, that’s something she can speak on. The only
  thing that I’m worried about right now is continuing to move forward through
  this tournament.” Ostapenko later denied any allegations of racism. “I was
  NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For
  me it doesn’t matter where you come from,” she said in a social media post.
  She also wrote about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”
  Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champion, has riled opponents in the past. At
  Wimbledon in 2021, Ajla Tomljanovic accused the Latvian of pretending to be
  injured when she requested a medical timeout. Ostapenko went on to call the
  Australian “the worst player on tour”. Townsend will play No 5 seed Mirra
  Andreeva in the third-round.
