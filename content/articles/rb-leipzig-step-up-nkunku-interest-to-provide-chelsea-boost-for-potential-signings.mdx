  RB Leipzig have stepped up attempts to sign Christopher Nkunku on a permanent
  deal, potentially paving the way for Chelsea to accelerate their search for
  attacking reinforcements. Chelsea need sales before pressing ahead with moves
  for Leipzig’s Xavi Simons and Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho but their
  hopes of shifting Nkunku appeared to have hit a dead end when Bayern Munich’s
  move for the forward stalled. Bayern had an offer for the Frenchman – a loan
  with an option to buy – rejected over the weekend and have so far shown little
  inclination of wanting to pay enough to buy him. Chelsea’s preference is a
  permanent sale rather than a loan for Nkunku as he is not part of their
  long-term plans. Inter are also interested in Nkunku, whose contract runs
  until 2029, but a return to Leipzig two years after leaving them for Chelsea
  for £52m is a possibility. The 27-year-old forward is open to a reunion with
  his former club, although other options are on the table. A deal with Leipzig
  is not close but there is confidence that they will be able to come to an
  agreement with Chelsea on a fee for the France international, who has
  struggled for form and fitness during his time in west London. The clubs have
  already held talks over Chelsea adding Simons to their attacking ranks.
  Chelsea are yet to lodge a bid for the Netherlands international, who wants to
  move to Stamford Bridge, and hope to move out fringe players before making
  further additions. Aston Villa are interested in Nicolas Jackson but would
  need a significant drop in his £80m asking price if they are to pursue a deal
  for the striker. Jackson wants a new challenge after seeing Chelsea sign Liam
  Delap and João Pedro. Chelsea have also strengthened on the flanks, signing
  Estêvão Willian and Jamie Gittens, but they want more depth on the left. They
  are pushing to sign Garnacho, who is viewed as competition for Gittens, but
  want United to drop their asking price of £50m for the Argentina winger.
  Garnacho, who has reportedly turned down a switch to Bayern, has fallen from
  favour at United and Chelsea are unlikely to want to pay over £40m. Other
  players expected to leave Chelsea are Tyrique George, Axel Disasi, Ben
  Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka, while Villarreal have agreed a deal to sign
  Renato Veiga from Chelsea for €29.5m. The Portugal defender joined from FC
  Basel for £12m last summer but struggled to establish himself in Enzo
  Maresca’s side and spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus.
  Chelsea have attached a sell-on clause of 40% to the deal..
