  Donald Trump has said he wants to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,
  possibly this year, in an attempt to revive the failed nuclear diplomacy of
  his first term as US president. “I’d like to have a meeting. I look forward to
  meeting with Kim Jong-un in the appropriate future,” Trump said during an
  occasionally awkward meeting at the Oval Office with South Korea’s new
  president, Lee Jae Myung, in which he raised the prospect of taking ownership
  of South Korean land that hosts a US military base. Trump, who met Kim three
  times in his first term, hailed his relationship with the totalitarian leader
  and said he knew him “better than anybody, almost, other than his sister” – a
  reference to Kim’s younger sibling and confidante Kim Yo-jong. “Someday I’ll
  see him. I look forward to seeing him. He was very good with me,” Trump told
  reporters, saying he hoped the talks would take place this year. Lee said the
  US president, who has attempted to bring peace – so far unsuccessfully – to
  longstanding disputes in Ukraine and the Middle East, was the “only person”
  who could end the decades-old standoff between South and North Korea, whose
  three-year war in the early 1950s ended in a truce but not a peace treaty. “I
  look forward to your meeting with Chairman Kim Jong-un and construction of
  Trump Tower in North Korea and playing golf,” Lee said. Trump also contended
  that North Korea had test-fired fewer missiles since he returned to the White
  House, although many analysts believe the regime’s focus is on its military
  support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some have also speculated that Kim
  has reined in missile tests while he appraises Lee, a liberal who believes in
  engagement with the North who was elected president in June. Despite Trump’s
  claims, Kim has been emboldened by the war in Ukraine, securing critical
  support from the Kremlin after sending thousands of North Korean troops to
  fight along side Russian forces. North Korea has refused to enter talks aimed
  at ending its development of nuclear weapons. Instead, Kim has pledged to
  speed up his nuclear programme, and recently condemned joint US-South Korea
  military drills that North Korea regards as a rehearsal for an invasion. This
  weekend, Kim supervised the test firing of new air defence systems. In a
  speech after his meeting in the Oval Office, Lee said he agreed with Trump on
  the need for the “peaceful denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”. But
  there were ominous signs for Lee in the hours leading up to his meeting in
  Washington, after Trump criticised the South Korean government, apparently
  over its handling of investigations related to the country’s former president,
  Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached and removed from office after a botched
  attempt to impose martial law late last year. The US president posted on his
  Truth Social platform: “What is going on in South Korea? Seems like a purge or
  revolution. We can’t have that and do business there.” The remarks cast a
  shadow over the high-stakes talks for Lee, although Trump later appeared to
  mellow after 40 minutes in which his South Korean counterpart heaped praise on
  the US president. Trump later rowed back on his post, saying, “I’m sure it’s a
  misunderstanding” as “there is a rumour going around”. Lee spoke through an
  interpreter, breaking the pace of Trump, who does not hesitate to pick fights
  with his guests. The US president, who frequently accuses European allies of
  freeloading off the US, made clear he would press hard for a greater
  contribution from South Korea towards the cost of hosting the 28,500 US troops
  in the country. Trump has made similar demands of the US’s other north-east
  Asian ally, Japan, which is home to almost 50,000 US troops. He suggested the
  US could seek to take over base land, an idea likely to enrage Lee’s allies on
  the left of South Korean politics. Trump said: “We spent a lot of money
  building a fort, and there was a contribution made by South Korea, but I would
  like to see if we could get rid of the lease and get ownership of the land
  where we have a massive military base.” Despite the US and South Korea
  clinching a trade deal in July that spared South Korean exports harsher US
  tariffs, the two sides continue to wrangle over nuclear energy, military
  spending and details of a trade deal that included $350bn in promised South
  Korean investments in the United States. South Korea’s economy relies heavily
  on the US, with Washington underwriting its security with troops and nuclear
  deterrence. Trump has called Seoul a “money machine” that takes advantage of
  American military protection. Since Trump’s January inauguration, Kim has
  ignored Trump’s repeated calls to revive the direct diplomacy he pursued
  during his 2017-2021 term in office, which produced no deal to halt North
  Korea’s nuclear program. In the Oval Office, Lee avoided the theatrical
  confrontations that dominated a February visit by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the
  Ukrainian president, and a May visit from Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African
  president.
