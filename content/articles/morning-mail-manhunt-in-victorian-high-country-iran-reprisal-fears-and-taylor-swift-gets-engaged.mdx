  Morning everyone. Police in Victoria are continuing their search for a
  “heavily armed” man suspected of shooting dead two police officers in the
  small alpine town of Porepunkah. Iranian Australians fear their families could
  be victims of reprisals back home after the expulsion of the country’s
  ambassador over Iran’s alleged orchestration of antisemitic attacks in
  Australia. Plus, our latest Essential poll points to public support for
  Palestinian statehood – and Taylor Swift is engaged to Travis Kelce. Australia
  ‘Scary situation’ | Australia’s Iranian community has welcomed the
  government’s strong action against Tehran but they worry loved ones back home
  could face reprisals from the regime’s feared security apparatus. Our
  political correspondent writes that Anthony Albanese tough stance against Iran
  over the intelligence it directed antisemitic attacks in Australia will be
  applauded by Israel but it won’t go all the way to repair relations between
  the countries. And our international security correspondent examines Iran’s
  track record in sponsoring terrorism around the world. Porepunkah shootings |
  A search is continuing for a man suspected of shooting two Victorian police
  officers “in cold blood” and wounding another after they tried to exercise a
  warrant at a rural property in the high country town of Porepunkah. He fled
  the scene into remote bushland and is “heavily armed”, police said. The
  suspect’s partner and children reported to a police station on Tuesday night,
  police said. Here’s what we know so far. Essential poll | More Australians
  back recognising a Palestinian state than oppose the move, but nearly half of
  voters think it will be purely a symbolic move. A majority of Australians also
  support a four-day work week and want more regulation of AI. Higgins verdict |
  Almost a year after the five-week defamation trial between Linda Reynolds and
  her former staffer Brittany Higgins wrapped up, a Western Australian supreme
  court judge is due to hand down his verdict today. Lamington launch | The
  lamington is being honoured as a great Australian food with Marks &amp;
  Spencer launching its own (quite significantly tweaked) version in Britain.
  World Love evermore? | Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have sent shock waves
  through social media overnight with a joint post announcing their engagement
  after a two-year courtship. Gaza demand | The UN has demanded that Israel’s
  investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap”
  bombing of Nasser hospital which killed 20 people, among them five
  journalists, yield results and ensure accountability. Troops row | Donald
  Trump has said he would “like to be asked” by Democratic governors to deploy
  the National Guard in their cities, after Chicago’s mayor strongly pushed back
  at the proposal. Long hot summer | The current British summer is set to be the
  warmest on record, forecasters say, after the country experienced four
  heatwaves. Nazi loot | More than 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis
  from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam, a portrait by an Italian master has
  been spotted on the website of a real estate agent advertising a house for
  sale in Argentina. Full Story Iran blamed for antisemitic attacks in Australia
  Nour Haydar speaks to political correspondent Tom McIlroy and senior reporter
  Ben Doherty about the alleged Iran-led terror attacks and the government’s
  response. In-depth A condo above the Four Seasons hotel in Atlanta is at the
  centre of Donald Trump’s attempt to seize control of the Federal Reserve, a
  traditionally independent branch of the government overseeing the US economy.
  That’s because it was bought by the Fed governor, Lisa Cook – who Trump wants
  to fire – with what the administration claims is a fraudulent mortgage
  application. She now says she’ll sue the government over its claims. Not the
  news Jennifer Lawrence defined cinema in the 2010s until Mother! ended her run
  of screen successes when it was released in 2017. But as it returns to
  streaming services in Australia, Andrew Fraser reappraises the film and hails
  what he says is a movie star turn of the “highest calibre”. Sport Tennis |
  It’s day three at Flushing Meadows where Maya Joint has won her first-round
  match in straight sets. Follow all the action live. Athletics | Australia’s
  athletics squad has suffered a double blow weeks out from the world
  championships in Tokyo, with rising sprinter Lachie Kennedy and genuine medal
  prospect Jemima Montag both ruled out with injuries. AFL| Adelaide Crows star
  Izak Rankine has been named in the 44-player All-Australian squad despite his
  current ban for making a homophobic slur. The final lineup will be unveiled at

  thrashing of Samoa, will not dampen the tournament’s momentum after hailing an
