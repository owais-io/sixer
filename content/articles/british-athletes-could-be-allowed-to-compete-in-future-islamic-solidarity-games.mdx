  Organisers of the Islamic Solidarity Games, a quadrennial event with 57
  nations competing in multiple sports, have left the door open for British
  athletes to take part in future, saying such a prospect would be “interesting
  to see”. The latest edition of the Games is to take place in Riyadh in
  November and – under the Saudi sports minister as president of the governing
  body, the Islamic Solidarity Sports Association – there is a desire to grow
  its international audience, which could involve inviting new countries to take
  part. “It would be great quality sports. It would be interesting to see,” said
  Nasser Majali, secretary general of the ISSA, who was speaking in London on
  Wednesday. “It depends on the appetite, it depends on what we are able to do
  based on sustainability. But having good quality sports competitions is always
  welcome.” Access to the event this year is limited to the 57 countries that
  make up the ISSA and which, in turn, are members of political grouping the
  Organisation of Islamic Co-operation. The ISSA includes countries from four
  continents and states with religiously diverse populations. Current members
  include Albania, Nigeria and the Caribbean state of Guyana, where muslims make
  up roughly 7% of the population, comparable to the 6.5% of population in
  England and Wales. Majali observed that athletes at the Islamic Solidarity
  Games could themselves belong to any religion or none. “The first Jordanian to
  win a gold medal at the 2017 games was a Christian, a spectacular swimmer,” he
  said. Majali added that while it was “currently” the case that the games were
  open only to ISSA members, “you don’t know how [participation] can be done in
  the future”. The Solidarity Games will be the first significant staging post
  on Saudi Arabia’s journey towards the 2034 World Cup and a possible Olympic
  bid. It will once again put an international spotlight on the Saudi capital of
  Riyadh, increasingly a magnet for major sporting events. The Games will see an
  athletes’ village built in the country for the first time and could feature
  events held outside stadia and in public spaces, as at the Paris Olympics last
  year. Majali, a former secretary general of the Jordanian Olympic Committee,
  said that the Saudi capital is now a “major” sporting destination. “You’ve got
  excellent quality competitions happening all the time there,” he said. “It’s
  become second nature to deliver such events and the quality is spectacular.
  From my point of view, it is a destination for sports events. And a major one
  at that.”
