  “There’s no extradition treaty, I looked that up myself actually,” says Tulip
  Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Highgate and a Treasury minister until her
  resignation in January. Just over a week ago, Siddiq, 42, a Keir Starmer
  loyalist, learned via a journalist who had contacted her lawyer that she had
  been formally indicted in Bangladesh for corruption. She has been charged with
  using her influence as the niece of Sheikh Hasina, the ousted prime minister
  of the south Asian country, to secure a plot of land for her mother, brother
  and sister in Purbachal in Dhaka, the capital. “Completely absurd,” Siddiq
  says in her first interview about the saga. A trial date has been set for 11
  August for her and more than 20 others. Could she make an appearance in person
  or by videolink? “I’m taking advice from Hugo Keith KC, who’s advising me on
  what my next steps are,” she says. “I’m yet to see an official summons … I
  mean, I’m supposedly days away from a showcase trial in a foreign country, and
  I still don’t know what the charges are against me. I feel a bit like I’m
  trapped in this Kafkaesque nightmare where I’ve been put on trial and I
  genuinely haven’t found out what the allegations are and what the trial is
  about.” The Bangladeshi authorities have said that they will try Siddiq in
  absentia if necessary. The position on extradition between Bangladesh and the
  UK may yet be tested if there is a conviction. For a few months last year,
  after Labour’s victory in the July general election, Siddiq, a veteran of the
  party who was a councillor before becoming an MP, was in her element.
  Appointed by Starmer – a friend whose constituency neighbours her own – as
  economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister, she got stuck into a
  review of the financial services. “I loved it, and I was good at it,” she
  says. Five thousand miles away, after 15 years in power, her aunt’s regime was
  falling apart in the face of student-led protests. After an outcry over the
  deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people demonstrating against what they
  said was an increasingly autocratic and cruel administration, Hasina and
  Siddiq’s mother, Sheikh Rehana, who was in the country at the time, fled the
  Bangladeshi capital in a military helicopter to India. It was, Siddiq admits,
  a scary time. Hasina’s entire family, apart from her husband, children and
  sister, were murdered during the 15 August 1975 Bangladeshi coup d’état in
  which Siddiq’s grandfather, the first president of Bangladesh, was
  assassinated. But, in the summer of 2025, life for Siddiq and her husband,
  Chris Percy, a strategic consultant, and their two children carried on as
  normal. “I’m not here to defend my aunt,” she says. “I know there’s an
  investigation going on about how her term in government ended. And I really
  hope the people of Bangladesh get the closure that they want.” It was only at
  the end of last year, with a new government established in Dhaka under
  Muhammad Yunus, an economist and the bitterest of rivals to Hasina, that what
  Siddiq describes as the “dirty politics” of Bangladesh turned her life on its
  head. Stories started to appear on obscure websites accusing her of embezzling
  $5bn from a deal made by her aunt with a Russian company to build the Rooppur
  nuclear power plant in Bangladesh. A photograph from 2013 of a smiling Siddiq
  with her aunt and Vladimir Putin in Moscow offered a fresh whiff of
  impropriety. “My aunt went on a state visit to Russia, and my sister and I
  decided to travel from London to go see her in Russia,” she says. “I was not
  involved in any sort of political discussions. We were sightseeing, and we
  were having a good time, just going to restaurants, shopping. Then on the last
  day, all the politicians who were there, their families were invited to a tea
  and reception, and a photo was taken. I met Putin for two minutes.” A new
  story emerged that Siddiq had been gifted a flat in King’s Cross in 2004 by
  “an associate of people linked” to her aunt’s political party, the Awami
  League. The flat’s former owner, her godfather, was not political or known to
  her aunt and “much to my dismay, he’s never voted”, she says. The problem for
  her was that two years previously she had told an enquiring newspaper that her
  parents had bought the flat for her. It was a mistake, grounded in the failing
  memory of her elderly parents, who separated a quarter of a century ago, she
  says. New questions were then raised as to why she was living in a house owned
  by a Bangladeshi-heritage property developer who she says she met through the
  Labour party, when she owns a home in Cricklewood. It was because she had been
  warned of a security threat, she says. A man being held on terrorism charges
  had suggested that Siddiq was the reason for his plight. It was the year the
  Tory MP David Amess had been murdered at work. She had been advised to move
  out and had relied on someone she knew due to the suddenness of it all. She
  was paying full market rent but mud was flying, often thrown from the
  authorities in Bangladesh. Some of it was starting to stick. Siddiq referred
  herself to Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial
  standards. After two weeks of “intense” daily meetings going through Siddiq’s
  finances, Magnus cleared her of breaking the ministerial code. He added that
  it was “regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational
  risks” that arose from her familial ties and her government role. The line is
  evidently irritating to her. “I can’t help who my aunt is at the end of the
  day,” she says. “It is a strange line because it is a bit like saying you
  should have been aware of your birth and how you were born.” She resigned in
  order to stop the story from being a distraction for the government despite
  Starmer’s continued support, she says. He made it clear that she could return
  one day. “He did make a joke and say, ‘In the previous administration, even
  people who had broken the ministerial code still stayed on, you know that?’”
  But allegations have continued to fly and Siddiq’s lawyers’ attempts to get
  clarity have not been rewarded, she says. There is certainly scant evidence of
  a renewed Bangladesh since Hasina’s regime fell. The promised elections are
  yet to happen. Lawyers at Doughty Street Chambers have been compiling evidence
  of abuses for the international criminal court, including “unprovoked and
  violent attacks against journalists, police officers, minorities and those
  connected with the former government party, the Awami League”. Siddiq tried to
  meet Yunus during his visit to the UK this year. He dismissed it, saying it
  would prejudice the judicial process. Meanwhile, the UK’s serious and
  organised crime agency has frozen almost £90m of London property belonging to
  two men linked to Hasina, including one property in which Siddiq’s mother
  lived and still has possessions. Nothing to do with her, Siddiq says. “The
  truth is that I’m collateral damage, because of this feud between Muhammad
  Yunus and my aunt,” she says. “These are wider forces that I’m battling
  against … There’s no doubt people have done wrong things in Bangladesh, and
  they should be punished for it. It’s just I’m not one of them.”
