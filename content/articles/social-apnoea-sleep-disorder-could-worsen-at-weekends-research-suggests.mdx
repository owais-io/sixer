  Letting your hair down at the weekend might be a well-known recipe for a
  hangover, but researchers say it might also increase the severity of a common
  sleep disorder. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) involves complete pauses in
  breathing or partial reductions in airflow that arise because muscles in the
  back of the throat relax, causing the airways to narrow or close. It is more
  common in groups such as older people and people who are overweight or obese.
  Now researchers have found the severity of the condition increases at the
  weekend. The study cannot prove the cause, but suggests it could be down to
  lifestyle factors such an increase in drinking and smoking, or changes in the
  type or patterns of sleep – all of which can increase the risk of the
  condition. As a result, they have called the phenomenon “social apnoea”.
  “Obviously, people tend to drink more on the weekend. They tend to smoke more
  on the weekend if they are prone to smoking,” said Prof Danny Eckert, a
  co-author of the research at Flinders University in Australia, adding that as
  well as a possible effect from irregular sleep patterns, it might also be that
  people were less likely to use devices such as continuous positive airway
  pressure (Cpap) machines to manage the condition at the weekend. The
  researchers say regardless of the underlying cause, the results matter given
  the health and safety implications of OSA. It is known to raise the risk of
  conditions including stroke, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and can
  also affect driving safety as a result of sleepiness, have an impact on
  relationships, and reduce quality of life. Writing in the American Journal of
  Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Eckert and colleagues report how they
  analysed de-identified data from 70,052 people – the majority of whom were
  middle-aged, male, and overweight – who used a commercially available
  under-mattress sleep sensor that can track heart rate, snoring and sleep
  apnoea. All participants had four or more sleep recordings a week, at least 28
  sleep apnoea measurements a year, and five or more breathing disruptions an
  hour during sleep, on average, a year. The team found the odds of moderate to
  severe sleep apnoea, meaning 15 or more breathing interruptions an hour, were
  18% higher on Saturdays compared with Wednesdays, and the effect was more
  pronounced in men and people under the age of 60. They also found weekend
  catch-up sleep of 45 minutes or more, compared with less than six minutes, and
  social jetlag – in other words, a clock-shift in sleep patterns – of 60
  minutes or more, compared with less than 18 minutes, was associated with 47%
  and 38% greater odds of having moderate to severe OSA respectively. Dr Sriram
  Iyer, an NHS respiratory and sleep consultant, who was not involved in the
  work, said the study highlighted the night-to-night variability in OSA
  symptoms, and the team’s assumptions about the cause of the weekend uptick
  were “perfectly reasonable”. Ryan Chin Taw Cheong, a consultant ENT and sleep
  surgeon at the Cleveland clinic, London, praised the size of the study, saying
  it was the first of its kind to look at variability in the severity of the
  condition throughout the week. While he noted that study did not include data
  on participants’ lifestyles, meaning it could not prove the cause of the
  increased severity of OSA at the weekends, he said factors such as smoking and
  drinking were known to exacerbate symptoms, and addressing such issues –
  alongside diet and weight – should be one of the first steps taken to tackle
  the condition. “With the best intentions, we can try to treat you medically.
  But if you’re consuming lots of alcohol or smoking heavily, whatever we’re
  doing as medical professionals will be just a drop in the ocean,” Cheong said.
