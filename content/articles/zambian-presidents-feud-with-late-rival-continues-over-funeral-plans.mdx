  A furious row is raging over whether the Zambian president, Hakainde
  Hichilema, will preside over the funeral of his predecessor, Edgar Lungu, as
  the former president’s family wage a legal battle in South Africa to try to
  prevent his body from being repatriated. The legal fight marks the latest
  twist in a feud between the two men that goes back at least a decade and has
  now outlasted the former president, who died in South Africa in June aged 68
  while being treated for an undisclosed illness. Mourners had already arrived
  for a funeral in Johannesburg in June when it was halted by a high court judge
  after an 11th-hour request by Zambia’s attorney general, Mulilo Kabesha.
  Lungu’s family said he had specifically requested that Hichilema not attend
  his funeral. On 8 August, the Pretoria high court ruled that Lungu’s body
  could be sent back to Zambia for a state funeral. Lungu’s older sister Bertha
  broke down, shouting across the courtroom at Kabesha as she was restrained by
  other relatives. Lungu’s family then applied for leave to appeal. On Monday,
  the high court adjourned the case indefinitely while South Africa’s
  constitutional court decides whether to hear the appeal. Meanwhile, conspiracy
  theories have spread, from rumours that Lungu is not actually dead to
  speculation that Hichilema wants to use the body for witchcraft. Many Zambians
  have joked about the saga. “It’s coming home!” Kodwani Banda, a self-described
  “youth advocate”, posted to his 356,000 Facebook followers, with an image of
  white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney. Emmanuel Mwamba, a
  spokesperson for the Patriotic Front, Lungu’s party, said: “There should have
  been more sympathy. When [government officials] came to South Africa, they
  were just interested in picking up the body and holding the funeral. It was
  very mechanical. Their approach lacked sympathy, lacked empathy, lacked a
  sense of Africanness, a sense of ubuntu.” Kabesha had previously argued that a
  state funeral with full military honours was a legal requirement, citing a
  court ruling on the burial of Zambia’s first president, Kenneth Kaunda. “The
  moment that a national mourning is declared, the law kicks in,” he told the
  Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation in June. Mwamba responded that a
  state funeral could be held without the current president presiding over it.
  “His presence doesn’t make it. A state funeral is, in fact, the protocols such
  as the gun salute, the pallbearers being soldiers, the ceremony being handled
  by the defence forces,” he said. Sishuwa Sishuwa, a political historian and
  senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University, said the burial dispute had
  heightened political discord in Zambia. “The faultlines have always been
  there, but the dispute over Lungu’s burial place has exacerbated the country’s
  regional and political polarisation,” he said. “Whatever way the dispute is
  resolved, it will have a significant bearing on the 2026 elections … A key
  reason behind the government’s court action in South Africa is to reduce the
  political costs of burying Lungu in exile.” Lungu ruled Zambia from 2015 to
  2021, having taken over when Michael Sata died in office. He defeated
  Hichilema in the 2016 presidential election, which Hichilema and his United
  Party for National Development (UPND) party claimed was rigged. The following
  year, Hichilema was sent to prison to await trial on treason charges after his
  convoy did not give way to Lungu’s presidential motorcade. Four months later,
  after an international outcry, he was released and the charges were dropped.
  Hichilema finally defeated Lungu in the 2021 elections, amid an economic
  crisis. Since then, he has been accused of using oppressive methods similar to
  those of his longtime rival. In 2023, police stopped Lungu from going out for
  runs, saying they were “political activism” that had to be approved in advance
  to “ensure public safety”. His wife and children have faced corruption
  charges, which they have denied and said were politically motivated. In 2024,
  Lungu was banned from running in next year’s presidential election by the
  constitutional court, which ruled that the period from when Lungu took office
  in 2015 until the 2016 election counted as a full first term.
