  We were looking out across one of the most beautiful panoramic views in the
  Lake District, above Ennerdale Water, with the dramatic horseshoe of fells all
  around us. Richard and Alison Maxwell of Howside Farm were teaching
  nature-friendly farming to a group of farmers and those aspiring to be
  farmers, all working in the Lake District. Howside started out as a small
  100-acre National Trust farm back in 1998, but it has greatly expanded since
  then, as they changed mindset from being focused on food production to
  considering nature as “essential”, as Richard puts it. First they took on land
  on Pillar, one of the tallest mountains in England, where they now graze a
  hefted flock of Herdwick sheep about nine miles from the farmstead. The stock
  of wethers (castrated males) was removed from the fell due to a government
  environmental scheme, and this made a massive difference to the abundance of
  bilberry, heather and mosses. Then they took on a forest from the Forestry
  Commission (they were the only farmers to turn up to the commission’s meeting
  on the matter). After that, there was a domino effect, with more opportunities
  coming up. In 2008 they changed from productive continental cattle to native
  galloway cattle, as part of the Wild Ennerdale project, and since then bird
  populations have soared, especially willow warbler, wren and chaffinch.
  Red-listed ring ouzel territories have increased, and dippers and green
  woodpeckers are new to the valley. We saw the herd of galloway cows with their
  calves – physical fencing has been removed and the cattle use Nofence collars
  to target grazing in particular areas, benefiting species such as the marsh
  fritillary butterfly (which was extinct in the Lake District not long ago).
  Other measures include farming without fertiliser or imported nutrients;
  introducing more trees, in the form of new hedgerow corridors; and oxford
  sandy and black pigs to help disturb the land. We were glad to see the pigs
  before heading back to the farmhouse for tea and cake. What the Maxwells have
  done is inspirational. They’ve made such a range of changes, taken lots of
  opportunities, and nature is benefiting as a result. It just shows what a
  family farm can do. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s
