  Neo-nazi Thomas Sewell – who allegedly led an attack on a First Nations
  encampment in Melbourne over the weekend – will continue to commit violent
  offences that could lead to death, a court heard. Sewell, 32, applied to be
  freed on bail on Wednesday after being charged over an alleged attack on
  Melbourne’s Camp Sovereignty on Sunday. Police charged Sewell on Tuesday with
  multiple offences, including violent disorder and affray over the alleged
  incident at the sacred Aboriginal burial ground and longstanding protest site.
  Sewell appeared in the Melbourne magistrates’ court on Wednesday morning.
  Detective senior constable Saer Pascoe told the court Sewell, who is
  unemployed and the full-time leader of the National Socialist Network, would
  continue to offend. He said there was a particular risk for vulnerable groups
  and ethnic minorities, while community-minded people who intervene could also
  be at risk from counter-attacks. “There is a real and likely risk of serious
  injury and death,” he said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Prosecutor
  Jonathan McCarthy said releasing Sewell on bail posed an unacceptable risk to
  community safety as he had a “propensity to offend in a violent way”. McCarthy
  said Sewell was a member of a “racially motivated organisation that uses
  ideology to commit offences”. Pascoe said the alleged attack occurred after
  members of the NSN attended an anti-immigration protest in Melbourne on
  Sunday, as similar demonstrations took place across the nation. Pascoe alleged
  Sewell led a group of about 30 NSN members towards the lawful encampment of
  First Nations people before “instructing them to charge”. The group charged
  towards the encampment before kicking signage, and kicking two Camp
  Sovereignty occupants, the court heard. In one alleged incident, two NSN
  members held down a Camp Sovereignty occupant while another two members hit
  the victim. Sewell allegedly punched and kicked a Camp Sovereignty occupant,
  Pascoe said. Pascoe said Sewell was the leader of the NSN and had “complete
  control”. “The applicant has at his disposal a large group of followers who
  will attack, on his instruction, without hesitation,” he said. Sewell’s
  defence lawyer, Matthew Hopkins, said the prosecution’s case that granting his
  client bail posed an unacceptable risk “didn’t come anywhere close to the
  threshold” and was “loaded with subjective, almost political commentary”.
  Hopkins argued prosecutors had not put any evidence to the court about
  racially motivated ideology and what constituted it. He said the court should
  not be “accepting that someone’s controversial political ideologies would give
  weight to an unacceptable risk of harm”. Hopkins said Sewell had also attended
  court hearings while on bail and would comply with any conditions imposed by
  the court. The alleged offences took place while Sewell was on bail over
  charges of intimidating a police officer, breaching multiple personal
  intervention orders. Police arrested Sewell outside the Melbourne magistrates’
  court on Tuesday afternoon, hours after he confronted the premier, Jacinta
  Allan, as she was holding a press conference in West Melbourne with the
  treasurer, Jaclyn Symes, and upper house MP Sheena Watt. He was separated from
  the premier by her security detail and the trio quickly left the park, with
  the press conference abandoned. Two other people – a 23-year-old from
  Mooroolbark and a 20-year-old from Ardeer – were also arrested on Tuesday over
  the Camp Sovereignty incident. Both were bailed to appeal at the Melbourne
  magistrates court on 10 December. Magistrate Donna Bakos will hand down her
  bail decision for Sewell on Friday morning.
