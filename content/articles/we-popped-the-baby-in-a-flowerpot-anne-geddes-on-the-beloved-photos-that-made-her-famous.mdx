  When Anne Geddes began shooting her famous photographs, she soon learned she
  would need a backup baby – or 20. “Connecting with a child who considers you a
  stranger is high stress,” she says. “I remember trying to shoot one baby
  sitting in a tank of water, surrounded by waterlilies. It took five babies to
  make it work. One of them was even called Lily, but she was not having a bar
  of it. She looked at me as if to say: ‘You think I’m getting in that water?’”
  She describes the practicalities of one of her best-known shots, 1991’s
  Cabbage Kids. It shows twin brothers Rhys and Grant with cabbage-leaf hats on
  their heads, each sitting in an upturned cabbage, turning to one another with
  mild alarm. Geddes’ assistant had tied a balloon to a piece of string,
  lowering it between them and whipping it up the moment they turned. Geddes got
  the shot. “That whole world has changed; that income has gone,” says the
  68-year-old Australian from her home in Manhattan, New York. Technology has
  changed everything. She calls Cabbage Kids “authentic”: “The props were all
  real. It was all in my garage. It’s funny; with Photoshop and AI, it makes me
  sad to think that if you came to my work now, you might question whether it
  was real. “I think original stories will always prevail. That’s why having
  people and humans behind the photographs is important. AI can’t replicate
  that.” If you grew up in the 1990s, there is every chance that, like me, you
  tacked a Geddes poster to your wall. Babies upright in a flowerpot or a
  bucket, or gazing sleepily from a peony, a calla lily or a bed of roses. Some
  were dressed as bumblebees, others with little fairy wings, snoozing on a bed
  of crisp autumn leaves. The images are whimsical, otherworldly and sometimes
  plain weird. But they have that rare quality of appealing to children without
  being childish and have begun popping up again, often ironically, on social
  media. They were disseminated initially not just on Hallmark greetings cards,
  but also on the cover of Vogue Homme, in a Dior advert and even in a 2004 book
  with Céline Dion (the best image shows the singer holding aloft a baby asleep
  inside an amniotic sac). The height of that period, for Geddes, was appearing
  on The Oprah Winfrey Show: “She came out carrying two babies dressed as
  bumblebees and we shot up the New York Times bestseller list!” But for many
  millennials, the peak of her fame was the episode of Friends in which Elle
  Macpherson’s character, Janine, moved in with Joey and attempted to “girlify”
  his apartment using Geddes’ photograph Tayla as a Waterlily. *** Geddes is
  striking, with silver hair, high cheekbones and bright skin, like Meryl Streep
  if Streep wore her cap backwards. She sits in front of a generic backdrop,
  warm, if a little reserved, speaking slowly and carefully about bumblebee
  suits and lily pads. It’s almost 30 years since she created Down in the
  Garden, a series of photographs of babies in and around flora and fauna, some
  of which will appear in her first ever retrospective, at the New Art Museum in
  Tübingen, Germany, this month. Among the 150 images are identical triplets
  sleeping in the hands of Jack, a school groundsman, whose hands also appeared
  in her 1993 photograph of Maneesha, a baby born prematurely at 28 weeks. For
  years, people have written to tell Geddes they keep this hopeful image on
  their fridge. Another photograph is of Tuli and Nyla. Geddes had two days in
  the studio, lots of babies and a giant Polaroid camera. “I had no props, but
  you need a vague plan when you work with babies, as you have to work quickly,”
  she says. When Nyla began fussing, Tuli rocked her and whispered into her
  hair. She grabbed the moment. Geddes refers to these prop-less, slightly
  quieter pictures as her “classic work” and the babies in flowerbeds as “what
  they know” – “they” being people like me, who grew up with them. “After Down
  in the Garden came out, it was all pots, pots, pots,” she says. “It was like I
  had a flowerpot tattooed on my forehead. People always want the flowerpots!
  But I’m like: I do other things. And what I’m looking forward to is that
  people will see the other work. This exhibition is really the first time
  anyone has asked me to do this.” Despite selling more than 10m calendars and
  almost twice as many copies of her seven coffee‑table books (for context, EL
  James shifted fewer copies of Fifty Shades of Grey in its first decade),
  Geddes hasn’t always been treated with reverence in an industry dominated by
  single-name stars such as Bailey and Rankin. Is it snobbery? “It’s just a bit
  of a guy industry,” she says. “[Men] would say: ‘I used to shoot babies, but
  then I moved on to landscapes.’ I was always puzzled. To me, babies are
  magical.” The response to the baby pictures has sometimes been frustrating,
  she says. “People said I was a one-shot wonder. I’m just as interested in
  shooting pregnant women or new mothers. It’s just people don’t want to talk
  about that as much.” With some earnestness, she says she now prefers
  photographing anything pertaining to the “promise of new life, the miracle of
  pregnancy and birth”; she hopes the exhibition will draw attention to that.
  “I’ve found that once the Europeans say: ‘This is amazing,’ then the Americans
  are like: ‘We want this, too.’ It has to be that way round.” Geddes was born
  in 1956 and grew up on a 10,500-hectare (26,000-acre) ranch in Queensland
  alongside four sisters. They were country kids who attended a two-room primary
  school. Photography wasn’t a big part of her life: “I only have three images
  of myself under two and none of me as a newborn.” As a teenager, she
  subscribed to Life magazine and became fascinated by the idea of telling a
  story through an image. Still, she lingered on the periphery of photography,
  going to work in television, where she met her husband, Kel. It was in those
  corridors that she came across the “magic” of the darkroom. Shortly after they
  met, the couple moved to Hong Kong, where Kel was running a new TV station.
  “Then we got married and I thought: I’ve got a roof over my head, now’s the
  time to pick up a camera.” She began putting up adverts in supermarkets,
  offering to photograph families and children, traipsing around their gardens
  and homes with a Pentax K1000 she borrowed from her husband. When she was back
  in Australia and pregnant with her second daughter, now 40, Geddes began
  taking her classic baby pictures. She realised that, in a studio, she could
  control everything. She started taking photos for new parents, spending months
  creating elaborate sets in her garage and trying out different props. A lot of
  the shots came about by accident. One day, a six-month-old called Chelsea was
  brought in for a portrait and Geddes spotted an empty flowerpot in the back of
  the studio: “We just popped her in there.” To keep her comfortable, she lined
  the pot with fabric. After a few months, she sent a collection of these images
  to a small greetings card company. That was that. At the beginning, she would
  put a call out for babies and take “whoever came through the door”. But she
  learned to be discerning. “Under four weeks is good. If they’re full of milk
  and warm, they’ll sleep.” She also liked working with six- and
  seven‑month-olds, “because they’re not mobile, but suddenly they’re sitting
  and have this whole new perspective. Also, their heads are too big for their
  bodies, which is funny.” “The more you charge [for a portrait], the more they
  want you to make magic with a two-year-old who is having a bad day,” she says.
  As she became well known, “people began sending in photos of their babies, or
  rang from the labour ward in tears saying: ‘I’ve just had the most wonderful
  baby.’ I was just like: ‘OK, yup, sure, let’s go.’” The images that appeared
  in calendars, posters, books and magazines were always used “with the
  permission of the parents”, she says, and the parents were always on set. “To
  me, a naked newborn baby is perfect,” she says. “They are us, essentially good
  people, at the start of their lives, and that’s what I love about them. That’s
  what I was trying to capture. You look at these tyrants that are running
  rampant [in politics] and think: they were once newborns. What happened? Why
  didn’t your mothers just tell you to sit down and behave?” Her main
  inspiration is May Gibbs’ 1918 book Tales of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, about
  little brothers who went on intrepid adventures in the Australian bush:
  “Photographers have to have their own visual signature. This became mine.” Her
  success is unusual, given how kitsch her images are. “This subject of mine is
  not deemed to be art and that’s been evident throughout my career,” she says.
  But that was also the point. “It was meant to be a children’s story, not
  serious.” Does she think it would be harder to make her images now, in the
  digital era, because of privacy concerns? She says she doesn’t think the web
  has affected her work in that way: “I know a lot of people talk about having
  their babies online, or not having them online, but this sort of work is not
  exposing the babies personally.” Geddes still refers to her images by the name
  of each baby, partly because she is still in touch with some of them. She
  recently put out a call, hoping to reunite with the babies, now in their 30s,
  many of whom are parents themselves. After we speak, I go to bed and begin
  scrolling through pictures of my own baby, asleep in the room next door. We
  love looking at our own babies, but why do we like looking at other people’s,
  too? We don’t always, says Geddes. She once came close to winning a big
  portrait award in New Zealand. “I remember the head of Kodak in New Zealand
  coming up to me and saying: ‘Thank God you didn’t win. How could we have a
  baby on the boardroom wall?’” • Anne Geddes’ retrospective exhibition, Until
  Now, runs from 16 August until 21 September at Art 28, Neues Kunstmuseum
  Tübingen, Germany
