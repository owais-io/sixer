  Even among the staunchest classical music lovers, the phrase “star
  clarinettist” rings false. Compared with celebrity pianists, violinists and
  singers, virtuoso woodwind players don’t get much time in the spotlight. Yet
  Swedish clarinettist Martin Fröst isn’t just capable of technical wizardry,
  but is also a mesmerising, full-body performer. On stage at the Royal Albert
  Hall, he danced, struck poses and contorted himself like a rock icon shredding
  a guitar solo. All while producing a tone of astonishing refinement,
  absolutely uniform across the instrument’s multiple registers. Fröst dominated
  the first half of the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra’s latest Proms outing.
  Copland’s Clarinet Concerto showcased his ability to blend minutely with
  orchestral timbres, his solo lines seamlessly interwoven with the cashmere
  warmth of the BBC Phil’s strings under Joshua Weilerstein. Meanwhile Fröst’s
  gear-change from the tenderness of its central cadenza into the sassy
  jazz-infused third section (here all hard-edged articulation and chippy,
  slightly rustic string playing) was utterly compelling. The much shorter
  concerto by celebrated jazz clarinettist and band leader Artie Shaw followed.
  Launching with a vibrant sting of trumpets, the BBC Phil sounded every bit
  like an unusually well-behaved big band with a string section for added
  pizzazz. Fröst clearly relished every glissando, every tricky corner of
  vocalise, every flight into the squeakosphere. By the time he demanded
  audience participation in his encore (Gounod’s Ave Maria, with Fröst playing
  Bach’s original prelude in C major as the audience sang), I suspect we’d have
  done anything he asked. Bookending the Fröst show: the short, beguiling
  Symphony No 2 by recently rediscovered French composer Elsa Barraine – its
  modernist angularity offset by hints of jazz, aerated by gracefully sculpted
  solos from the BBC Phil’s own excellent wind players – and a taut, high-octane
  performance of Rachmaninov’s Symphonic Dances. Weilerstein approached the
  latter’s many hairpin bends like a racing driver with a title in his sights,
  cleaving a direct line through changes of tempo and mood, drawing out colours
  that morphed from the ultra-dry to utter suavity in the central waltz, before
  letting rip in a thrilling, wild ride of a finale – the closing triumph of an
  orchestra on blistering form. The late-night prom couldn’t have been more
  different. Celebrating Arvo Pärt’s 90th birthday year, the Estonian
  Philharmonic Chamber Choir performed various vocal works by the Estonian
  composer (most in their first Proms performances), alongside a Bach motet, a
  couple of numbers from Rachmaninov’s All Night Vigil and two short works by
  Pärt’s Estonian contemporaries. Most were a cappella; Kadri Toomoja provided
  the minimal accompaniment demanded on organ and piano. Under Tõnu Kaljuste,
  the choir’s fine-grained blend sounded almost studio-produced and their
  intonation was remarkable, open fifths and octaves ringing brilliantly into
  the dome. Yet even the kaleidoscopic late-night lighting couldn’t distract
  from the lack of variety in this blandest selection from Pärt’s musical world.
  Only Veljo Tormis’s haunting Curse Upon Iron, accompanied by shaman drum and
  climaxing in a blood-curdling collective scream, offered a glimpse of
  something more – but also felt entirely out of place amid the wall-to-wall
  soothing triadic harmony. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The
  Proms continue until 13 September.
