  The sun may have been shining but the blustery winds barrelling in over the
  dunes on the edge of the North Sea delivered a buffeting that might just have
  been enough to play a decisive factor in the absolutely minuscule margins in
  qualifying for the Dutch Grand Prix that divide the two Formula One title
  protagonists this season. It was Oscar Piastri who took a slender advantage
  over his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, in what remains an absolutely
  nip-and-tuck contest as the title run-in begins. Max Verstappen in the Red
  Bull did his best to push the McLaren duo but really this was another
  startling demonstration of their complete stranglehold on the season. The pair
  have been on top all weekend, with Norris quickest in all three practice
  sessions. When it mattered, though, it was Piastri who had the edge, pipping
  his teammate to pole by 12 thousandths of a second, barely a breath between
  them. Such margins may yet decide this championship. Piastri leads Norris by
  nine points, they have five poles apiece, with the Australian on six wins to
  Norris’s five. With ten meetings remaining, every edge counts now and Piastri
  has his nose in front for Sunday on a circuit where making up places is tricky
  indeed. “The hardest guy to normally overtake is your teammate,” said Norris.
  “Especially when in a quali like today we’re split by one hundredth of a
  second. It’s going to take some magic.” That is especially true given how
  evenly the two drivers are matched in a field of their own at the front.
  Indeed, even with Verstappen wrestling far more than might reasonably be
  expected from his recalcitrant Red Bull, still struggling with the grip and
  balance problems which have beset it all season, he was more than two tenths
  back in third, while Racing Bulls’ Isack Hadjar was half a second back in
  fourth. The rookie delivered a fine run to take a career-best place. At the
  very sharp end, however, this was only ever a two-horse race, as is the title
  fight. The pairs’ times were all but interchangeable as they charged round the
  short, testing challenge in Zandvoort, which requires absolute precision for a
  quick time. Piastri had the better of the first sector, Norris the second, and
  choosing between them was all but impossible until the clock stopped. The
  Australian held the edge over the line on his first hot run with a time of
  1min 08.662sec and, while both pushed for their second runs, neither could
  improve. Piastri was as composed as ever, pleased with what was some clinical
  execution, and Norris conceded he had been well beaten, admitting he had not
  reached the limit quite consistently enough but emphasised that the margins
  had been tiny. “With a wind like this, a lot of it’s down to luck as well,”
  the Briton said. “I made a good lap in the first run of Q3 but just a smaller
  headwind down the straight on the final one, and I lost like one hundredth, so
  you could easily say that was that …” The pole, Piastri’s first at Zandvoort,
  is another strong statement and something of a return to form over the single
  lap by the young Australian: it was his first since the Spanish GP in June
  demonstrating once more that he is a formidable opponent, with a steely
  resilience. Piastri will also be confident he can maintain his title lead in
  the Netherlands. At Spa, where the Australian went on to win, he passed Norris
  for the lead on the opening lap, making the most of his slipstream from second
  on the grid, but he was then disappointed when Norris pulled off a strategic
  coup in Hungary to win before the summer break. The momentum has certainly
  been with Norris, with three wins from the last four races, and Piastri will
  want to exploit pole and stamp his authority on the title fight once more. “It
  felt good and like a good improvement from pretty much every other lap I did
  this weekend,” he said. “So it was nice to be able to pull it out but it took
  a lot of hard work, some patience in trying to find the time, and eventually I
  got there.” George Russell was in fifth for Mercedes, with Ferrari’s Charles
  Leclerc in sixth, the Monegasque driver surprised by an adventurous fox
  dashing by his Ferrari during one of his laps. Lewis Hamilton took seventh for
  Ferrari in what he had hoped to be something of a reset to his season after
  the summer break. Having spun in two practice sessions, Hamilton enjoyed at
  least a more solid run during qualifying, albeit with him and Leclerc almost
  seven tenths off the lead, and the seven-time champion felt positive about his
  evolving relationship with Ferrari. “Yesterday the car was a bit unpredictable
  and I think we made some changes, maybe the wind makes it a little bit
  difficult as well,” he said. “But I think we were looking for progress and I
  feel like I have had that this weekend, I’ve not been in Q3 for some time, so
  I am grateful for that. “It definitely feels like it’s been one of the most
  solid couple of days so far of the year. That’s to do with some of the
  improvements of the process, my approach, it’s just a little calmer overall.”
