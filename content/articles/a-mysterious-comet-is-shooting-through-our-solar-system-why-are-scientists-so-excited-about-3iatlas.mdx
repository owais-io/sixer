  An object that came from outside our solar system is hurtling towards the sun
  at roughly 61km (38 miles) a second. First detected in July, this visitor from
  outer space – known as 3I/Atlas – is only the third known interstellar object
  to have been observed, after ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.
  Excitement has been growing since the Hubble space telescope captured an image
  of the interstellar interloper, offering scientists a rare opportunity to
  analyse its size and chemical makeup. “We’ve never had an object like this to
  study before,” says Dr Rebecca Allen, co-director of Swinburne’s Space
  Technology and Industry Institute. What exactly is 3I/Atlas? “We don’t know
  exactly where it came from, but it definitely came from outside the solar
  system,” says Dr Laura Driessen, a radio astronomer at the University of
  Sydney. The name comes from “i” for interstellar, “3” as the third such object
  detected, and Atlas for the network of telescopes that identified it, called
  the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. While some have speculated
  about an alien incursion, scientists say 3I/Atlas is probably a comet. You may
  remember the speculation over ‘Oumuamua, which astronomers checked for radio
  signals in case it was an alien craft. It wasn’t. “There’s no evidence to
  point towards [3I/Atlas] being anything other than a really fun space rock
  that came from outside the solar system,” Driessen says. “Which, to be honest,
  is cool enough.” Why are scientists excited about the interstellar object? In
  the Hubble image, 3I/Atlas looks a bit like a “fuzzy snowball”, Allen says.
  Its hazy appearance is due to its “coma”, which is formed as the comet’s
  surface is heated by the sun, releasing dust and gas, and there are signs of a
  comet tail. Those chemical signatures – of elements and molecules from outside
  our solar system – will become more visible the closer it gets to the sun,
  Allen says. “We can use a tool called spectroscopy, and we can use light to
  actually understand exactly what that material is. Does this comet represent a
  solar system that had very similar conditions to our own, or is it something
  completely different?” Researchers have already used the Hubble image to
  estimate the diameter of 3I/Atlas to be less than 5.6km, and potentially as
  small as 320 metres. Where is 3I/Atlas heading? The space object is travelling
  at more than 200,000km/h, Allen says. “It’s going to kind of cruise through
  the inner solar system – in between Mars and Earth’s orbit – and then it will
  fly past the sun. “This one is on what we call a hyperbolic orbit. So it’s not
  gravitationally bound to the sun. It’s travelling much too fast, and so it
  will just fly out the other side of the solar system.” Its interstellar
  origins make 3I/Atlas different from other comets that orbit within the solar
  system, such as Halley’s comet, says Con Stoitsis, the comet and meteor
  director at the Astronomical Society of Victoria. It is expected to make its
  closest approach to the sun between October and December – coming within about
  210m kilometres – and then continue its journey into space. According to Nasa,
  the closest 3I/Atlas will come to Earth is about 270m kilometres. “We’re not
  really sure where it’s going to end up until it comes around from the other
  side of the sun, and starts heading out to the outer solar system again,”
  Stoitsis says. Can we see the comet? While faint at the moment, the comet is
  expected to brighten as it approaches the sun, eventually bringing it “within
  reach of most large amateur telescopes”, Stoitsis says. Even then, 3I/Atlas
  will probably appear like a smudge, he says. “We get bright-ish comets, three
  or four times a year, which are visible with small telescopes and binoculars.
  This is definitely not one of those,” he says. “Unless you’ve got a
  decent-sized telescope, you won’t see it.”
