  Over the past year or so, you would have been hard pushed to read any of the
  New Eves’ interviews without feeling at least a little intrigued by what the
  Brighton quartet are reportedly up to. Said features usually discuss their
  onstage theatricality – there is talk of improvised dance and indeed
  “experimental ballet”, and of fake blood and their all-white homemade
  costumes, equal parts cottagecore and Midsommar. There are indications that
  the music the band make is merely part of a broader artistic practice that
  also involves painting, writing, photography and “traditional female crafts”,
  among them knitting. Then there’s mention of their curious instrumentation, in
  which violin, cello and flute have as much role to play as guitar, bass and
  drums. And there’s a frequent suggestion that the band are sonically sui
  generis: “We weren’t consciously inspired by any other musicians … it was like
  we created a new universe of paradise without even realising that’s what we
  were doing”; “The Velvet Underground are the only band I can compare us to –
  there’s a similar spirit there, but the New Eves aren’t about genre”. Claiming
  you are, as Duke Ellington liked to say, “beyond category” is part of any new
  band’s standard attention-grabbing arsenal. And in this case, in one sense at
  least, it isn’t true. Any alternative rock band who deploy strings to scrape
  and drone are almost inevitably going to attract some kind of comparison to
  the John Cale-era Velvet Underground. But, intentional or not, there are also
  plenty of other reference points you might reasonably mention to describe the
  music on the New Eves’ debut album The New Eve Is Rising. Something of the
  Raincoats’ rickety post-punk explorations seem to haunt its sound, albeit
  relocated from Notting Hill to a more pastoral setting. So does the lo-fi
  avant-garage rock of the early-80s Fall, which is audible amid the simple
  riffs and relentless drumming of Highway Man. There is occasionally a bleating
  quality about the vocals that automatically summons the ghost of Tyrannosaurus
  Rex-era Marc Bolan. Equally, at their most full throated, they recall the
  powerful but ascetic harmonies of folk family the Watersons. When the vocals
  tend to spoken word declamation – as on opener The New Eve – you might think
  not only of Patti Smith but those moments in Crass’s oeuvre when the
  microphone was ceded to Eve Libertine and Joy De Vivre. And yet, if there are
  plenty of artists other than the Velvet Underground whom you could compare the
  New Eves to – from trad folk to distaff anarcho-punk to hippy whimsy – the
  band’s central point still stands. Whatever ingredients went into the recipe,
  the result doesn’t ultimately sound like much else, and there is often
  something rather thrilling about being in its presence. The weird blend of
  glam drums, sawing strings and folky vocal roar on Cow Song, for example.
  Volcano’s slow surge from gentle fluting bucolia to a potent sense of menace.
  The moment on Rivers Run Red when the scrabble of strings and guitars
  dramatically finds an urgent percussive shape. It’s given an extra frisson by
  the fact that, whatever the circumstances of its recording, The New Eve Is
  Rising sounds as if it’s being played live, by a band who prize immediacy over
  virtuosity, with all the teetering potential for disaster that suggests.
  There’s a certain white-knuckle intensity to the moment when Circles shifts
  its rhythm, and given that the change is counted in with such vociferousness,
  perhaps it hasn’t always come off in the past. Said disaster never strikes,
  although you do occasionally wonder if something may have been lost in
  translation from live show to studio, despite their best efforts. The
  spoken-word manifesto of The New Eve probably feels more viscerally powerful
  delivered in front of your eyes than it does coming out of your speakers. But
  the moments when the album doesn’t quite work are tempered by the sense that
  this is a band still in a state of flux and progress, working out where they
  might go next – the “rising” in the title seems the operative word – rather
  than a perfectly finished product with all of the doubts about how to move on
  which that would entail. That the New Eves are overflowing with ideas is
  obvious from their interviews and their debut album alike. The latter presents
  them in rough hewn and occasionally chaotic style: it feels exciting, as does
  their future. What Alexis listened to this week Cate Le Bon – Is It Worth It
  (Happy Birthday)? An equivocal title for an equivocal song – the dreaminess of
  whose sound is undercut by a strange, sickly quality. It’s both addictive and
  slightly disturbing.
