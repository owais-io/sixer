  Inadequate safety practices, deliberate efforts to avoid oversight and a
  “toxic workplace culture” were among the factors that led to the 2023
  implosion of the Titan submersible, the US Coast Guard has said in a damning
  report that described the disaster as a “preventable tragedy”. The submersible
  was on a commercial voyage to explore the wreck of the Titanic when it
  disappeared in the Atlantic, leading to the deaths of all five people on
  board. The ensuing search captured headlines around the world for days as it
  evolved from a potential rescue mission to a recovery operation. US Coast
  Guard investigators released their final report on Tuesday. It spans more than
  300 pages after a two-year investigation. What emerged was a scathing portrait
  of the company operating the Titan, OceanGate, and its chief executive,
  Stockton Rush, who was among those who died. Based on hearings involving more
  than two dozen people, including former employees, the report paints a picture
  of OceanGate as a company where employees were threatened with dismissal and
  belittled for raising concerns about safety. The result was a culture of
  downplaying, ignoring and even falsifying vital safety information to improve
  its reputation and evade scrutiny from regulators. “OceanGate’s toxic safety
  culture, corporate structure, and operational practices were critically flawed
  and at the core of these failures were glaring disparities between their
  written safety protocols and their actual practices,” the report said. “For
  several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation
  tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company’s favourable
  reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny.” Investigators found the Titan’s
  design, certification, maintenance and inspection process were all inadequate.
  “This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,” said Jason
  Neubauer, the chair of the Coast Guard’s Marine Board of Investigation, in a
  statement. Employees told investigators Rush would often bypass established
  protocols and ignore the concerns of experienced employees and contractors.
  “The cumulative effect was an authoritarian and toxic culture where safety was
  not only deprioritised but actively suppressed,” the report said. “This toxic
  environment, characterised by retaliation and belittling against those who
  expressed safety concerns combined with a lack of external oversight, set the
  stage for the Titan’s ultimate demise.” The report cited mounting financial
  pressures in 2023 as being behind a decision made by OceanGate to store the
  Titan submersible outdoors over the Canadian winter. “During this time, the
  submersible was not covered or protected from the environmental elements,
  subjecting it to precipitation and repeated freeze-thaw cycles,” it said,
  likely leading to further degradation of the hull’s structural integrity.
  Investigators concluded Rush had “exhibited negligence” that contributed to
  the deaths of four people. Had Rush survived, the case would have likely ended
  up at the US Department of Justice and he might have been subjected to
  criminal charges, the report noted. In addition to Rush, the implosion killed
  the French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, the British adventurer Hamish
  Harding and the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his
  19-year-old son, Suleman. OceanGate wound down operations and focused its
  resources on cooperating with investigators, a company spokesperson said on
  Tuesday. In a statement, he added: “We again offer our deepest condolences to
  the families of those who died on 18 June 2023, and to all those impacted by
  the tragedy.” OceanGate began ferrying dozens of paying customers and
  researchers to the site scattered with debris from the Titanic in 2021,
  characterising the voyages as part of an ambitious push to foster deep-sea
  tourism. Last year, the family of Nargeolet filed a wrongful death lawsuit
  seeking more than $50m amid accusations that the “doomed submersible” had a
  “troubled history” and that OceanGate had failed to disclose crucial facts
  about the vessel and its durability. Neubauer was optimistic that the
  investigation would help to prevent future tragedies. “There is a need for
  stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new
  concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework,” he said. That view was
  echoed by the Dawood family. “No report can alter the heartbreaking outcome,
  nor fill the immeasurable void left by two cherished members of our family,”
  they said in a statement. “We believe that accountability and regulatory
  change must follow such a catastrophic failure.” The hope was that the tragedy
  would be a turning point for the submersible industry, the family added. “If
  Shahzada and Suleman’s legacy can be a catalyst for regulatory change that
  helps prevent such a loss from ever happening again, it will bring us some
  measure of peace.”
