  Rachel Reeves has promised to use her autumn budget to prioritise fixing
  Britain’s dismal record on productivity as she sought to downplay mounting tax
  speculation with a focus on economic growth. Setting out her priorities for
  the budget for the first time, the chancellor said tackling the efficiency of
  the economy through higher investment and a fresh assault on planning rules
  would form the backbone of her tax and spending plans. Writing exclusively for
  the Guardian, she said: “If Labour’s first year in power was about fixing the
  foundations, then the second year is about building a stronger economy for a
  renewed Britain.” However, Reeves pushed back against what she called
  “speculation” over tax increases being explored by the Treasury to close a
  yawning gap in the public finances that is estimated to reach more than £40bn.
  “The months and weeks before any budget are filled with people speculating
  about – or claiming to know – what tax and spend decisions I will take or what
  the Office for Budget Responsibility [OBR] will conclude,” she said. “This
  budget is no different – I get that. I will set out the decisions I take in
  the responsible manner.” The chancellor’s comments come as the government
  braces for gloomy official figures that are expected to show the economy
  narrowly avoided flatlining in the second quarter. With Labour under mounting
  pressure over its management of the economy, City forecasters predict that
  Thursday morning’s update from the Office for National Statistics will find
  that GDP rose by 0.1% in the three months to June. The UK outpaced its G7
  peers in the first quarter with growth of 0.7%. However, experts have blamed
  tax increases announced by Reeves in her first budget, last October, and
  Donald Trump’s trade war for a marked hit to activity. The chancellor, aiming
  to shrug off the anaemic performance, argued the government was taking steps
  to break a “cycle of low growth” in which Britain had become trapped under
  Conservative governments. Laying out one of the central themes of her budget,
  which could be held in November, Reeves said the government would aim to boost
  the productive capacity of the economy by allocating investment for
  infrastructure projects and ripping up planning rules. “If renewal is our
  mission and productivity is our challenge, then investment and reform are our
  tools,” she said. Earlier on Wednesday, the Guardian revealed that Keir
  Starmer was preparing to revive plans for the Northern Powerhouse Rail
  project, which would improve transport connections between the main cities of
  northern England. Reeves has ordered Treasury officials to draw up proposals
  for slashing additional red tape in the UK’s planning system to speed up large
  infrastructure projects. “We are providing that investment and unblocking the
  barriers to it too,” she said. Successive chancellors have pushed to solve
  what economists refer to as a “productivity puzzle” that has contributed to
  the UK’s sluggish growth since the 2008 financial crisis. Productivity growth
  is considered one of the key determinants for raising living standards and
  wages over the long term. However, progress to drive up the measure of output
  per hour of work has stalled in recent years. The chancellor’s renewed focus
  comes as the Treasury braces for a potentially devastating downgrade in
  productivity forecasts from the OBR, which could blow a £20bn hole in the
  chancellor’s tax and spending plans. With the shortfall made worse by a weak
  growth outlook, higher debt interest payments, and a series of U-turns on
  welfare cuts, Reeves and the prime minister are laying the groundwork for tax
  rises and changes from September, before the autumn budget. The Guardian
  revealed on Tuesday that the Treasury was looking at ways to raise more money
  from inheritance tax to reduce the deficit. Labour MPs have been pushing the
  idea of a wealth tax, but changes to inheritance tax thresholds could be
  similarly controversial. Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at
  Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was “hardly surprising” that inheritance tax was
  “back in the frame”. It is among a limited suite of taxes that can be changed,
  despite the government’s commitment to not increase the basic, higher or
  additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT. “The
  system is so fiendishly complex that there are an enormous number of rules,
  and therefore tweaks, that the government could consider,” Coles added.
