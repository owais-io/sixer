  A day after Texas Democrat lawmakers fled the state in an effort to halt
  Republican efforts to redraw their congressional map, Donald Trump said that
  his party was entitled to the five more seats they could pick up if the
  updated maps pass through the state’s congress. “We have an opportunity in
  Texas to pick up five seats,” Trump said. “We have a really good governor, and
  we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas. I got the highest vote in the
  history of Texas, as you probably know, and we are entitled to five more
  seats.” Democrats in other states have said they will retaliate, setting the
  stage for a nasty and prolonged redistricting tit-for-tat that could last for
  years. Here are the key US politics stories of the day: Texas senator asks FBI
  to help locate and arrest Democrats for leaving state The US senator John
  Cornyn of Texas has asked the FBI to aid Texas law enforcement in locating and
  arresting Democrats who left the state to forestall a plan sought by Donald
  Trump to aggressively redraw the state’s congressional map in a way that could
  help Republicans keep their House majority after the 2026 midterm elections.
  Ken Paxton, the state’s Republican attorney general, announced what experts
  say is likely a longshot bid to convince a court to declare the seats of “any
  rogue lawmakers” vacant if they do not return to work at the statehouse by
  Friday. Read the full story Epstein scandal broadens as new trove of letters
  published The long-running scandal surrounding the disgraced late financier
  and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein broadened on Tuesday after the New
  York Times published a trove of previously unseen letters to Epstein from
  numerous powerful figures as well as unseen photographs from inside his
  Manhattan mansion. Read the full story House panel subpoenas Clintons for
  Epstein testimony The Republican-led House oversight committee on Tuesday
  issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as several former
  attorneys general and directors of the FBI, demanding “testimony related to
  horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein”. Read the full story Rwanda
  agrees to take up to 250 migrants from the US The Rwandan government has said
  it would accept up to 250 migrants from the US under a deal agreed with
  Washington but gave no details on who could be included. The Trump
  administration’s deportation drive has included negotiating arrangements to
  send people to third countries, among them South Sudan and Eswatini. Read the
  full story Pam Bondi seeks grand jury review of origins of Trump-Russia
  investigation The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, is said to be ordering
  prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury investigating the origins of
  the FBI’s Trump-Russia inquiry, according to the Associated Press. The
  criminal probe follows referrals from Trump administration intelligence
  officials and targets the investigation that established Moscow interfered in
  the 2016 election on Donald Trump’s behalf, a source who spoke on condition of
  anonymity told AP. Read the full story What else happened today: News Corp has
  warned Donald Trump that AI is cannibalizing the content of his books,
  including The Art of the Deal. Donald Trump said he would soon announce his
  pick for an open seat on the Federal Reserve board and possibly his choice for
  Fed chair, but ruled out treasury secretary Scott Bessent. Catching up? Here’s
  what happened on 4 August 2025.
