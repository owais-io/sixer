  Act

  The UK’s Online Safety Act has been greatly anticipated. Amid mounting
  concerns about the ease of accessing harmful content online, rules were drawn
  up to force social platforms to protect children from posts and videos that
  incite hatred or encourage suicide, self-harm or eating disorders. But within
  days of coming into force, the new approach to keeping children safe online
  had become a rallying point for the right in both Britain and the US. Last
  week Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, was embroiled in a
  furious row with a Labour government minister after pledging to repeal the
  legislation. Meanwhile Republicans held meetings with UK politicians and the
  communications regulator, Ofcom. The impact of the new law is also being
  keenly watched in Australia, which is preparing to ban under-16s from social
  media. Experts say the inherent tensions in the act – between taking down
  harmful content swiftly and preserving free speech – are likely to bubble
  away. Zia Yusuf, a senior Reform figure, said: “So much of the act is massive
  overreach and plunges this country into a borderline dystopian state.” In
  response to Reform UK’s criticism of the law, Peter Kyle, the technology
  secretary, said: “Make no mistake about it, if people like Jimmy Savile were
  alive today, he’d be perpetrating his crimes online. And Nigel Farage is
  saying that he’s on their side.” Kyle was referring to provisions in the act
  that seek to prevent children being groomed via messaging apps. Farage said
  the technology secretary’s words were “disgusting” and demanded an apology,
  which was not forthcoming. “To say that I would do anything that would in any
  way aid and abet people like Jimmy Savile, it’s so below the belt,” Farage
  added. It is not only the British right that is protesting against the act. JD
  Vance, the US vice-president, said free speech in the UK is “in retreat”. Last
  week, Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman who has criticised the act, led a
  delegation of US politicians to discuss the legislation with Kyle and Ofcom.
  Jordan called the act the “UK’s online censorship law” and accused Ofcom,
  which is implementing the legislation, of “targeting” and “harassing” US
  companies. The group of Republican and Democrat politicians also visited
  Brussels to discuss the Online Safety Act’s EU equivalent, the Digital
  Services Act. Another Republican politician in the delegation, Scott
  Fitzgerald, said he thought the White House would certainly be “interested in
  finding out” what the group discovered. The Trump administration’s concerns
  have extended to threatening Ofcom and EU staff with a visa ban. In May the
  state department announced it will block entry to the US to “foreign nationals
  who censor Americans”. Ofcom has said it is seeking “clarity” on the planned
  visa restrictions. Concerns over free speech also intersect with economic
  interest. The major tech platforms that come under the aegis of the act –
  Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat and X – are all based
  in the US. Companies can be fined up to £18m or 10% of global turnover for
  breaches, or whichever is greater. In the case of Meta, the parent of
  Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, such a fine would equate to $16bn (£11bn).
  On Friday, the social media platform X, owned by self-professed free speech
  advocate Elon Musk, issued a statement condemning enforcement of the act,
  saying the legislation was at risk of “seriously infringing” free speech.
  There are also signs of a popular backlash in the UK. A petition calling for
  the repeal of the act has accumulated more than 480,000 signatures – which
  means it will be considered for a debate in parliament – and has been posted
  on social media by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Tim Bale, professor
  of politics at Queen Mary University of London, doubts nonetheless whether
  freedom of speech is a vote-winner. “Petition or no petition, it’s not a big
  issue for most people. Clearly for the extremely online – whether on the right
  or left – it’s an issue, but it’s not going to sway a large number of votes
  with the majority of the population.” Three in four UK parents are concerned
  about what their children are seeing, hearing or doing online, according to a
  recent Ipsos Mori poll. Beeban Kidron, a UK peer and leading campaigner on
  online child safety, told the Guardian she was “happy to take Nigel Farage and
  his colleagues through the act”. “If companies target kids, algorithmically or
  otherwise, why would Reform put the kids at the mercy of tech bros?” The new
  under-18 guidelines in the UK, which kicked off the latest row, require
  age-gating of pornography sites to prevent children from gaining access. But
  they also require platforms to prevent children from accessing content that
  encourages suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, as well as suppressing the
  spread of material that is abusive or incites hatred, or promotes harmful
  substances and dangerous challenges. Some content has been age-gated to avoid
  being classified as breaching those regulations. In the Daily Telegraph,
  Farage claimed that footage of an anti-migrant protest had been “censored”, as
  well as an attempt at “exposing the truth” about the Rotherham grooming gangs
  scandal. These examples were on X and included a speech by a Conservative MP,
  Katie Lam, on the UK’s child grooming scandal. The content was covered by a
  notice stating that “due to local laws, we are temporarily restricting access
  to this content until X estimates your age”. The Guardian found no way to
  access an age-verification service on X, indicating that for now the
  platform’s policy is to default many users to a child-appropriate service
  until age checks are fully up and running. X has been approached for comment
  on the age-checks. On Reddit, forums about alcohol abuse, pet care and the Al
  Jazeera broadcast network also ask for age checks before accessing them. A
  Reddit spokesperson confirmed the age-checking was because of the Online
  Safety Act and its restrictions on content that is illegal or harmful to
  under-18s. Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties and privacy campaign group,
  said the Reddit and X examples showed the new law was already over-regulating.
  An Ofcom spokesperson said the act required tech companies to prevent children
  from seeing content harmful to them as well as tackling criminal content,
  while protecting free speech. “There is no requirement on them to restrict
  legal content for adult users.” Mark Jones, a partner at the London law firm
  Payne Hicks Beach, said there was a risk that in exercising their duty to
  remove illegal content or material that was harmful to children, social media
  companies may be overly cautious and remove perfectly legal material in the
  UK. He added that rows over how content was treated by Ofcom were likely to
  run and run because of the tension between speedily tackling harmful content
  and letting free speech reign. “Quick decisions are needed in order to prevent
  the spread of harmful or illegal content. And with that need for speed comes a
  risk that a decision made under time pressure may be incorrect. But that is
  the reality of the situation. Mistakes will be made – albeit from a position
  of trying to prevent harm,” he said. Last week’s row over the Online Safety
  Act will not be the last.
