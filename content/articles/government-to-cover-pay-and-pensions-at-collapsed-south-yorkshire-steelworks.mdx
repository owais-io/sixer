  Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks, in South Yorkshire, have been
  assured that they will receive their pay for August as well as unpaid pension
  contributions after a government-appointed special manager took over the
  collapsed company. Liberty Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK
  (SSUK), was put into administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court
  judge ruled that it was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon
  Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million
  pounds. The judge approved an application by the government’s official
  receiver, a representative tasked with winding up insolvent companies, to
  appoint special managers from the advisory company Teneo. A Teneo senior
  managing director was in court on Thursday, and made contact with Liberty
  Steel executives immediately after the hearing. Concerned union leaders
  representing SSUK’s 1,450 workers met the special managers last night, seeking
  assurances particularly on pay and pensions, as well as on when operations
  could restart at sites including Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South
  Yorkshire, after a year without work. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of
  Community, the biggest steelworking union, said he had “received firm
  assurances” on pay and pensions. The court heard on Thursday that SSUK had
  only £650,000 left in its bank account, with the August payroll of £3.6m due
  on Friday. Gupta’s counsel had argued that he was ready to cover the payments
  via another company, Liberty Capital UK, although the judge, Mr Justice
  Mellor, said Gupta’s assurances that he could pay “are at best questionable”.
  The special managers have committed that workers will receive their August pay
  packets before the bank holiday weekend. They also said that they will fill in
  unpaid employer pension contributions for the past year. That will remove a
  major source of concern for workers, who had feared losing national insurance
  protection next month if the company were to close. It remains unclear when
  the plants will restart production, although a person briefed on the talks
  said the special managers had given positive signals that it could happen
  soon. Restarting production and trying to generate cash after four years in
  which it lost £340m will be crucial to limiting the costs of the
  administration, which will be borne temporarily by the government. Rickhuss
  said: “This is an extremely worrying time for our members at Liberty Steel,
  but the government’s intervention must mark a turning point to deliver
  certainty for these strategically important businesses. “Crucially, jobs must
  be protected throughout any restructuring and transition to new ownership.
  Steelworkers at Liberty Steel are highly skilled and hugely experienced. They
  are quite frankly irreplaceable and will be critical to delivering future
  success for the businesses.” Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite
  union, said the government “must provide long-term guarantees that it will
  protect jobs” and be ready to run the business itself if no buyer can be
  found. The government this week told the court via a letter that several
  potential buyers had already made contact to express interest in buying SSUK
  from administration. The ruling removes the business from Gupta’s control,
  although one of his executives, Jeffrey Kabel, said that GFG would try to buy
  the business back out of insolvency. Gupta still retains several other UK
  businesses, including a pipes business in Hartlepool that HM Revenue and
  Customs had sought to wind up, an aluminium smelter and a steel plate mill in
  Scotland, and a steel coil plant in Newport, south Wales. Kabel insisted that
  those businesses would continue to operate, and claimed that production was
  ready to restart at the Scottish plate mill in Motherwell, which has also not
  produced anything for a year.
