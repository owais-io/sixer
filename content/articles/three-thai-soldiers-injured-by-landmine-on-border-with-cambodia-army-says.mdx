  Three Thai soldiers were injured on Saturday after one tripped a landmine in
  territory along its frontier with Cambodia, Thailand’s army has said as it
  accused the neighbouring country of planting concealed weapons in violation of
  international law. The incident, in which a Thai sergeant major suffered
  severe injuries, came two days after the countries reasserted their commitment
  to a ceasefire that ended a brief but intense period of fighting. Cambodia
  denies the accusation. The army’s statement said the incident took place in
  Thailand’s Sisaket province and “clearly demonstrates to both domestic and
  international society that the use of concealed weapons in border areas
  continues to exist, constituting a clear violation of the Ottawa Convention by
  the Cambodian side”. The Ottawa Convention is an international treaty banning
  the use of landmines, signed by 164 countries, including Cambodia and
  Thailand. The incident on Saturday risks enflaming tensions, which remain high
  despite the fragile truce agreed on 29 July to end the armed conflict. Five
  days of fighting broke out last month after five Thai soldiers were wounded
  when one stepped on a mine in disputed territory. The clashes, which killed at
  least 43 people on either side of the border and displaced more than 260,000,
  amounted to the worst fighting between the neighbouring countries in more than
  a decade. Since the truce was agreed, both sides have accused the other of
  breaching it. Relations remain rocky while anger is being stirred online by a
  mix of disinformation, threats and nationalism. Two days after the two sides
  met in Malaysia to sign a 13-point agreement on implementing their ceasefire,
  the Thai army’s statement said that Saturday’s incident constituted “a
  significant obstacle to the implementation of ceasefire measures and peaceful
  resolution of problems”. Cambodia strongly denies laying new concealed
  weapons. “We have not, and will not, plant new landmines,” the Cambodian Mine
  Action and Victim Assistance Authority said in a statement. It said Cambodia
  had cleared more than 1m mines and nearly 3m other unexploded weapons dating
  back to a period of war and civil unrest that began in 1970 and lasted more
  than three decades. The Thai sergeant major lost his left foot in Saturday’s
  incident, according to the Thai army statement, while two privates suffered
  less serious injuries. Associated Press contributed to this report
