  The image of Jesus has been used by some to shame and subjugate queer people
  across the Christian world, but Alpaqa theatre collective dare to ask: what if
  Jesus was queer himself? In this cheeky musical comedy, one of the winners of
  this year’s Untapped award for rising theatrical talent, we meet young Jesús
  (Sergio Antonio Maggiolo), son of Maria and Jose, who is getting ready to make
  his first holy communion. It’s not the only first heading his way; a sexual
  awakening is brewing. Guido Garcia Lueches plays the other characters –
  parents, priests and, most magnificently, Jesus himself. The pair bring the
  show to life with a musical number for each chapter, moving through acoustic
  ballads to high-octane pop, all with a Latin twist. The tale unfolds in the
  Peru of President Fujimori, a strongman leader later charged for ordering
  killings and kidnappings by his military-led government, in which Jesús’s
  father is a rising star of the armed forces. The sycophancy of his supporters
  is explored with a sexy romp of a song: “We will suck your massive dic …
  tatorship.” At home, Jose rules with religion and homophobia, leaving little
  Jesús fearing the feelings stirred when he sees presentations of semi-naked
  Jesus – on the crucifix and in his city’s beloved Lord of Miracles painting –
  in a new light. The erotic overtones of religious imagery are explored in
  another song. He’s been told to love Jesus, and he does – so why is he made to
  feel like it’s the wrong kind of love? Whether he hides his sexuality or comes
  out, he considers himself condemned to suffer. Jeezus! lightly explores the
  grip of religious patriarchy and the potential salvation of embracing love
  with no limits, in a sweet and smutty hour of uplifting musical comedy. As the
  pair sing at the close: “If love is a mortal sin, let’s burn in hell.” • At
  Underbelly, Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival
