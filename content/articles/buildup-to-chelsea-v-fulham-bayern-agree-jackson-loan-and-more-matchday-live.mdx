  United v Newport County Chesterfield v Crawley Town Arsenal head to Merseyside
  tomorrow to face last season’s title rivals Liverpool in what is expected to
  be the game of the weekend. Given the signings they’ve made this summer, the
  Gunners can go into this clash with some confidence – but they arguably face
  more pressure also. Nuno Espirito Santo has another piece of the jigsaw he
  craves: Nicolo Savona has joined Nottingham Forest from Juventus on a
  five-year deal. The 22-year-old, who predominantly plays as a right-back,
  bolsters Nuno’s defensive options, though the Forest head coach still wants a
  left-back and a goalkeeper. Savona is the second player to join Forest from
  Juve this summer, with Douglas Luiz arriving last week. Forest have turned to
  Botafogo’s John Victor as they search for a backup to Matz Sels, who shared
  the golden glove award with David Raya last season. Nuno plans to hold talks
  with owner Evangelos Marinakis during the international break to resolve his
  future and clarity over future transfer plans is likely to be a key point of
  discussions. Time for me to hand over to Emillia Hawkins for the next couple
  of hours. Don’t forget to send in any (serious) questions for Jacob Steinberg
  at Stamford Bridge; you can post them BTL or email
  matchday.live@theguardian.com. In Fantasy Football terms, Dominik Szoboszlai
  had the square root of bugger all to do with Rio Ngumoha’s winner at Newcastle
  on Monday. In Actual Football terms, it was a note of beauty. After almost two
  years since Football Weekly’s last live show, we are returning for one night
  only to Troxy in east London on 11 September and we’d love just shy of two
  thousand of you to join us (please). A break of almost 24 months surely means
  that Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and the assembled Football Weekly
  glitterati are brimming with new anecdotes, opinions and video content ideas…
  right? The show will feature the podcast’s unique take on the world of
  football – plus, audience interaction, special guests and stories the lawyers
  don’t let us tell on the podcast. To give you a flavour of what to expect,
  previous Football Weekly live shows have featured Mark Langdon’s Meat Raffle,
  Steve Claridge’s fruit eating marathon and a t-shirt that got us in trouble
  with one of football’s major governing bodies. Max and Barry will be joined by
  Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew. Leeds v Newcastle (5.30pm)
  European football The reigning champions in Europe’s big five leagues have all
  made winning starts to the season and are in action this weekend: Augsburg v
  Bayern (5.30pm) Napoli v Cagliari (7.45pm) Toulouse v PSG (8.05pm) Liverpool v
  Arsenal (Sunday, 4.30pm) Rayo Vallecano v Barcelona (Sunday, 8.30pm) In other
  La Liga news, Real Madrid host Mallorca tonight. A perfect excuse to plug this
  piece from one of my favourite interviewers, Sid Lowe. The Fantasy Football
  deadline is 11am, so you might want to schedule some last-minute faffing at
  10.45am. Since you asked, I’ve brought in Richarlison and Brennan Johnson for
  Cole Palmer and Jarrod Bowen. The first Old Firm derby of the season takes
  place tomorrow. We’ll have a Q&amp;A with Ewan Murray on tomorrow’s matchday
  live. In the meantime, here’s his preview of a match that is likely to be
  shrouded in angst and anger. “Is it just my Arsenal-supporting brain that
  feels this way, or does the whole of this weekend in the Premier League just
  feel like a preamble to tomorrow’s clash at Anfield?” wonders Kári Tulinius.
  “I don’t ever recall feeling this way in August, the most meaningless of
  football months. I suppose it’s a symptom of a league where a champion can
  only afford to lose 20 points across a whole season. Even a draw is 10 percent
  of the way to second place.” Last season Liverpool could have lost 39 points
  and still won the title, though I appreciate that was a bit of an outlier.
  Even so, I’d be loath to douse tomorrow’s game in too much hype. It has the
  potential to be a statement game but there have been plenty of those in
  Augusts past. Ruben Amorim knows that Manchester United cannot afford to lose
  against Burnley. The midweek defeat to Grimsby was the lowest moment of a
  reign that has seen few positives. Nine months in, the dramatic change
  required at Old Trafford is yet to be witnessed. There is a commitment to
  Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation and it does help the squad because there are
  glaring personnel problems, forcing the head coach to field Bruno Fernandes
  and Casemiro as the central midfield pair. More than £200m has been spent on
  the forward line but that means everything behind them is still the same as
  the side that finished 15th in the Premier League last season. The Old
  Trafford faithful will give their backing to Amorim because they are desperate
  for this to work. Another mid-season sacking would suggest a great failure
  from the club’s hierarchy and trying to find a suitable successor at this
  point would be very difficult. Amorim has not just caused issues on the pitch
  but also off it; Alejandro Garnacho has departed for £40m, a fee arguably half
  what he was worth when the Portuguese coach arrived in November. Supporters
  will be disgruntled that their best academy graduate of recent times, Kobbie
  Mainoo, wants to leave. If he were to go, it would indicate a short and
  long-term failure of United. A win against the Clarets will at least make
  people forget these problems for 24 hours until deadline day begins. Burnley
  will almost certainly be in a relegation battle come the end of the season but
  they are less than ideal opponents for United. As Grimsby proved, getting at
  United by offering relentless energy and pressing is more than enough to
  unsettle and Scott Parker’s side possess that in spades. Kyle Walker has six
  wins at Old Trafford in his career and would relish adding a seventh, while
  Hannibal Mejbri will want to show the club they were wrong to let him go. It
  should be an intriguing clash. Bayern Munich have agreed a deal to sign
  Nicolas Jackson on loan from Chelsea. Bayern are paying a €15m loan fee for
  the striker and I’m told there’s a €65m option to buy. Jackson is out of
  favour at Chelsea after the arrivals of Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. He joined
  from Villarreal in 2023 and has done well but is heading off to Germany for a
  new challenge. A good signing for Bayern. Leeds v Newcastle (5.30pm) The
  Alexander Isak saga is wheezing towards a conclusion, or least a hiatus. The
  imminent signing of Nick Woltemade increases the chances of Isak joining
  Liverpool before Monday’s transfer deadline, though Eddie Howe used
  yesterday’s press conference to refute rebut Isak’s talk of “broken promises”.
  Thomas Tuchel named his England squad yesterday ahead of the World Cup
  qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s omission was
  the big news; Tuchel also apologised for choosing the wrong word in his second
  language to describe Jude Bellingham’s occasional on-field excess.
  Championship: Leicester 2-0 Birmingham A sizzling finish from Abdul Fatawu was
  the highlight of Leicester’s win over Birmingham in last night’s Championship
  game. Birmingham dominated almost all of the underlying statistics – but not
  the overlying one. Jacob Steinberg will be at Stamford Bridge for the
  lunchtime game between west London’s finest. Before the game we’ll have a
  Q&amp;A with him on all things Chelsea, Fulham – and West Ham, the other club
  on his journalistic beat. If you have any questions for Jacob, post them below
  the line or email matchday.live@theguardian.com. Serious questions, please;
  we’re all trolled out. Hello and welcome to matchday live, our buildup to all
  the day’s association football action. We’ll have previews, transfer news and
  more between now and midday, at which point we’ll hand over to, er, Rob Smyth
  for live coverage of Chelsea v Fulham. That’s one of six Premier League games
  today. And here they are. Chelsea v Fulham (12.30pm) Man Utd v Burnley
  Sunderland v Brentford Tottenham v Bournemouth Wolves v Everton Leeds v
  Newcastle (5.30pm) Kickoffs 3pm unless stated What are your plans for the day?
  Football-related, ideally, but if you’re creosoting the fence that’s fine. Let
  us know either below the line or by emailing matchday.live@theguardian.com.
