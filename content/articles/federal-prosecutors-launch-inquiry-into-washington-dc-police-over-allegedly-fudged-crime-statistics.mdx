  fudged crime statistics

  Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into allegations
  that Washington DC police systematically manipulated crime statistics to make
  the city appear safer than it actually is. The probe, anonymous sources tell
  the Washington Post, NBC News and Fox News, being conducted by the US
  attorney’s office for the District of Columbia under Jeanine Pirro, is the
  latest escalation between the Trump administration and DC officials over
  federal control of local policing. The justice department did not respond to a
  request for comment on the investigation. Trump somewhat confirmed the
  investigation on Monday, writing on social media that DC provided “fake crime
  numbers” to create a “false illusion of safety” and officials were “under
  serious investigation”. The federal investigation reportedly started after
  Cmdr Michael Pulliam was suspended in May by the Metropolitan police
  department for allegedly altering crime data. The local NBC station reported
  last month that Pulliam, the former commander of Washington DC’s 3rd district
  that patrols the Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, faced
  accusations from the police union of falsifying data, including misreporting
  stabbings and carjackings as lesser offenses. Pulliam denies the charges. But
  federal prosecutors are now examining potential wrongdoing by multiple police
  and city officials, according to law enforcement sources. DC’s mayor, Muriel
  Bowser, has repeatedly cited police data showing violent crime down by 27%
  over the last year to argue against Trump’s federal takeover of local police.
  The department has separately reported that violent crime fell by 35% in 2024.
  The chief of DC’s police union, Gregg Pemberton – who supports federal control
  – calls both sets of statistics “preposterous”, and said officers know the
  reality on the streets. “We go call to call to call – robbery to carjacking to
  stabbing to shooting,” Pemberton told NBC News Washington last week. “Crime is
  ubiquitous in every quadrant of the city.” Pemberton claimed that Washington
  DC police have a directive to underreport violent crimes. “What we’ve heard
  through our members and through members of management that were willing to
  talk with the union is that this is a directive from the command staff … that
  they wanna make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted
  over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down,” he told NBC.
  “And this is deliberately done.”
