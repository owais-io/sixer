  Parents across the country are stocking up on uniforms, booking in shoe
  fittings and gearing up for the return to school. Whether your child is just
  starting reception or well into secondary school, it’s a big adjustment after
  six weeks off. Arming them with tools to cope with the change, and the right
  kit, can ease this period for everyone. My eldest daughter is going into year
  two and after over-buying everything on the school’s list when she started in
  reception, I now buy just a few essentials every year. And I make sure I’m
  buying products that last. Here are the best tips, tricks and buys that will
  last beyond half term from parents (and children) to mark the return to the
  classroom. *** Back-to-school essentials *** Name everything Buy a batch of
  sticky labels with their names on it – I get my kids to put them in their
  uniforms and kit themselves. Try to keep the first few weekends of the new
  school year free, because however well adjusted and excited kids are about the
  new year, the change is always a big deal. They often come out of school with
  little to say and suddenly open up at bedtime or on a car journey, so being
  around without too much going on in those first few weeks can really help.
  Steph Douglas, Kingston Name stickers and stamps are a firm favourite, as
  they’re an easy way to keep track of everything from pencil cases to T-shirts.
  But lots of people I know just use a Sharpie to write their child’s name on
  everything. Rebecca Goodman Name stickers From £9.99 at Labels 4 School £12.95
  for 60 at Amazon Sharpies, pack of five £3 at John Lewis £3.99 at Ryman ***
  Erasable pens Make sure you’ve got a good supply of Legami pens and don’t
  forget they have a rubber on the end to erase mistakes. And if you stick your
  paper in the freezer for five minutes, the writing will come back – great for
  sending secret messages. Bridget Boyle, 7, London Legami erasable pens From
  £1.95 each at Cass Art £12.35 for seven at Amazon *** De-stress the night
  before The night before, have a really nice bubble bath or an extra-long
  shower so you’re really relaxed and refreshed and ready for the next day. Ena
  Murphy, 12, Hampshire Sleepy bubble bar £4.50 at Lush Satsuma shower gel,
  250ml £3.50 at the Body Shop *** Get hard-wearing school shoes Practice
  walking in new school shoes before the start of term to avoid pinching or
  rubbing, and go to a shop for a fitting if possible. We find shoes from
  Start-Rite, ToeZone and Clarks are especially hard-wearing for the entire
  school term. Get your children involved with choosing the shoes too, to avoid
  any refusals when they go back to school. RG Younger children: Double strap
  rip-tape shoes From £30 at John Lewis Leather strap shoes £48 at Start-Rite
  Older kids: Lace-up shoes £42 at Clarks Leather rip-tape shoes £60 at
  Start-Rite *** Thermos flasks We used Thermos food flasks throughout infant
  and most of junior school for our twins. You can heat up things like pasta or
  dumplings in the morning and they’ll still be warm by lunch. Claire Walker,
  Buckinghamshire Thermos Funtainer food flask, 290ml £18.59 at Mountain
  Warehouse £12.74 at Amazon *** Pack the night before (and take a water bottle)
  Pack your lunch and bag the night before school, so you’re not in a hurry in
  the morning. Also fill up a water bottle so it’s all ready for you. I like the
  Owala bottles because they’re big and keep my water cold throughout the day.
  Holly Smith, 16, Norfolk The Filter’s top pick: Owala FreeSip water bottle,
  710ml £31.99 at Owala £27.99 at Amazon Ion8 water bottles are great. They
  don’t leak as they have a locking mechanism, so they’re safe when thrown into
  bags too. Andy Coley, London The Filter’s top budget pick: Ion8 water bottle,
  400ml £12.99 at Decathlon £13 at Argos For more, read our guide to the best
  water bottles *** Backpack (with sections) Choose a rucksack with a separate
  netting section for primary school, so you can put a water bottle in here and
  away from everything in the bag in case of leaks. When you get to secondary
  school, the bottle will need to go into your bag (or it might get pinched), so
  choosing one that doesn’t leak is even more important. Isabel Mason, 16, North
  Somerset Hype backpack £29.99 at Ryman Superdry Montana backpack £39.99 at
  John Lewis £39.99 at Superdry *** Wellies and waterproofs My daughters go to a
  forest school so they need a set of wellies and waterproofs for the outdoor
  sessions, in any weather. Full-on puddle suits are best for younger children,
  while waterproof trousers with braces seem to keep the most water out for
  older ones. We also like wellies with a bit of grip and an inner lining, which
  are more comfortable and warmer when going out in deepest darkest winter. RG
  Puddlestomper wellies £30 at Muddy Puddles Waterproof puddle suit £36 at Muddy
  Puddles Regatta waterproof puddle suit £14.99 at Decathlon Waterproof jacket
  and trousers set £34.99 at Mountain Warehouse *** Set up a ‘spares’ box Stock
  up on school items you’re likely to need to buy again – such as scientific
  calculators, stationery and the inevitable World Book Day costumes – when
  they’re in the sales. Most schools also have a pre-loved uniform collection,
  often with brand new items that have never been worn, and there are local
  Facebook and WhatsApp groups for these too. Sarah Poulter, Leeds ***
  Stationery essentials Younger children will be supplied with most of the
  stationery they need, especially in the first few years of primary school. For
  older children, the Helix Oxford back-to-school kit has everything you need,
  including an Oxford scientific calculator and a clear pencil case that might
  be needed for exams. RG Helix Oxford complete stationery set £22.74 at Amazon
  *** Open up the conversation It can be hard to get children of any age to talk
  about things that have happened at school, even if it’s something mundane like
  what they had for lunch or who they sat next to. I always go first and share
  something about my day – who I’ve seen, something funny that happened or what
  my favourite thing of the day was. This works for us with opening up the
  conversation even in the post-school tiredness phase. Emily Veall, Hampshire
  *** Lunch box I’ve had a green Yumbox lunch box for six years. They’re very
  convenient and you can fit a lot of different things in them to eat during
  snack and lunchtime. There’s lots of compartments, so you can have things like
  yoghurt in one and wraps in another and the food always stays put. Ivor White,
  9, Jersey Yumbox lunch carrier £31.95 at The Range Munchkin bento box £22.99
  at John Lewis £23.99 at Munchkin *** WhatsApp groups and stain bars Watch out
  for the WhatsApp groups: they can be very handy for dates and events but also
  distracting and full of some interesting views and opinions. I’d also
  recommend getting a Vanish stain bar to win the battle between white tops and
  school dinners. It also works well on sun-cream stains during the summer.
  Charlene Young, Cheshire Vanish stain remover bars £7.19 for a pack of three
  at B&amp;Q £8.90 for a pack of six at Amazon *** Save some annual leave It’s a
  good idea to keep some annual leave days spare for the days off you’ll
  probably need to take for the constant colds, coughs and school bugs that seem
  to sweep through classrooms like wildfire. RG *** Get back into a sleep
  routine Start getting back into your usual sleeping schedule before you go
  back to school so you don’t get too tired and it doesn’t feel too bad getting
  up for school in the mornings. Listening to an audiobook on my Alexa is a good
  way to wind down before sleep. Rowan Boyle, 10, London Echo Dot kids smart
  speaker £39.99 at John Lewis £39.99 at Amazon *** Load up food cards Always
  check there’s enough money on your school food card if you have hot dinners,
  and make a budget for it to last the week. Rulers get snapped a lot so always
  have spares, and check your bag or pockets each week to make sure you’ve got
  everything you need – including a pen, so you don’t get detention. Sam Lawson,
  13, Cambridgeshire Helix clear folding ruler £2 at Waitrose £3.90 at Amazon
  *** Pack a raincoat Always make sure there’s a packable waterproof coat in
  their bags, no matter the weather, just in case. Anthony Forchione,
  Buckinghamshire Waterproof packaway jacket £15 at Regatta £27.99 at Decathlon
  *** Power hearts Some children will struggle with leaving you, especially when
  they’re younger. I’ve used several tools to help with drop-offs, including
  drawing a little heart on your and your child’s wrist, just before you say
  goodbye to them, to give you both a little boost throughout the day and to
  serve as a reminder that you’ll soon be reunited. RG *** Get good-quality
  tights To get ahead for secondary school, I started buying two pairs of Snag
  tights a month for my daughter when she was in year six. They’re the best and
  last ages, so now she’s in year eight she has loads and I won’t need to buy
  any for a while. Sarah Lewis, Brighton £8.49 a pair at Snag *** Pencil cases
  Whatever colour, design or style your child is into, there’s a pencil case for
  them. Smiggle’s Wonder World cases have in-built calculators and secret
  storage compartments too. For older children, just check if the school has any
  specific requirements on the colour or material first (such as cases needing
  to be clear). RG Smiggle pop-out pencil case £15 at Next From £7.90 at Amazon
  Clear pencil case £1.49 at Ryman *** Keyrings and charms for your bag If
  everyone has the same bags, a keyring with your name or initial on or
  something bright and fluffy can help. I can spot my red book bag quickly as
  I’ve got an ‘F’ charm and a Lego keyring on it. Florence Goodman, 6,
  Cambridgeshire. Inital keyring £8 at Monsoon Resin keyring £12 at Oliver Bonas
  Lego-style letter keyring £3.99 at Not On The High Street *** What not to
  bother with … There’s a lot of pressure on parents to buy everything new at
  the start of term, but if your child hasn’t grown much since the summer, last
  term’s uniform will almost definitely still fit; summer clothes are often worn
  for the first few weeks at least. Everything on the list Most schools send out
  a list of all the required uniform and equipment your child will need, but
  it’s not always necessary to buy everything. Apart from the basic clothes, if
  you wait until your child is at school you can then see what they actually
  need. In my daughter’s first year of school, for example, I bought some black
  PE trainers that weren’t used until about March – by then, she had grown out
  of them. I also got a backpack for her, but in the first year she only needed
  the school’s book bag. RG Cheap water bottles I’ve had to throw out more water
  bottles than I care to think about and it’s sickening thinking about the money
  I’ve spent on them – and the waste generated (although many of ours have been
  repurposed for toys and crafts). I’ve also had to deal with lots of bottle
  leaks from cheap plastic bottles – and bags full of water and sodden books and
  paper. RG Uniform with logos I always buy a few uniform sets with the school
  logo on (handy for school photo days) but you probably don’t need every item
  to have one – just check your school’s requirements. Uniform without a logo is
  significantly cheaper and there are often discounts running. RG
