  Manchester United are close to sealing a a €21m (£18m) plus add-ons deal for
  Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens, having chosen him over Aston Villa’s Emiliano
  Martínez to strengthen Ruben Amorim’s goalkeeping options. Lammens was due to
  travel to Manchester on Monday afternoon prior to signing a five-year
  contract. United consider the 23-year-old, who has nine caps for Belgium’s
  Under-21 side, a prospect for the future who can also challenge André Onana or
  Altay Bayindi for the No 1 spot immediately. United had considered signing
  Martínez but the Argentina World Cup-winner’s £35m asking price and age – he
  turns 32 on Tuesday – ultimately made Lammens the club’s favoured option.
  Meanwhile, Villa have agreed a deal to sign Jadon Sancho on loan that will see
  them cover 80% of the winger’s wages. Rasmus Højlund is also in Italy as he
  looks to secure a loan move to Napoli. An agreement is in place with the Serie
  A champions and. United expect the deal to happen, one that will include an
  obligation from Napoli to sign Højlund on a permanent basis if they qualify
  for the Champions League. United are almost certain to end the window with no
  new midfield acquisition. Kobbie Mainoo’s wish to leave on loan will not be
  granted.
