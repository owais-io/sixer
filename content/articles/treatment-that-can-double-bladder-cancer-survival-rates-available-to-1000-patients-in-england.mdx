  More than 1,000 patients living with bladder cancer in England will be
  eligible for a treatment which can double survival rates from the disease. In
  England, 18,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year, and only
  about 10% of people with stage 4 bladder cancer will survive five years or
  more after they are diagnosed. The treatment, enfortumab vedotin with
  pembrolizumab, has been approved for use on the NHS from Thursday. About 1,250
  patients across the country to be offered the therapy, which has been
  described by NHS bosses as one of the “most hopeful advances in decades”.
  Clinical trials of the drug have shown that people with bladder cancer that
  has spread (metastasised) live up to twice as long when given the combination
  antibody treatment when compared with those given normal chemotherapy. One
  trial also found that almost 30% of patients had no detectable traces of
  cancer in their body following treatment with enfortumab vedotin and
  pembrolizumab, compared with only 12.5% with chemotherapy. Prof Peter Johnson,
  NHS England’s national clinical director for cancer, said that the treatment
  is “one of the most hopeful advances in decades for people with bladder
  cancer”. He added: “Bladder cancer is often difficult to treat once it has
  spread, but this new therapy is the first one in years to really help stop the
  disease in its tracks, and our rollout to NHS patients will make a huge
  difference to the lives of those affected and their families.” The therapy
  works by enfortumab vedotin directly targeting the cancer cells and killing
  them, while pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, helps the immune system
  recognise and fight the remaining cancer cells. Life expectancy for people
  with bladder cancer which has metastasised is usually only just over a year,
  but this new therapy increased survival for people with this stage of the
  disease by more than one year. Jeannie Rigby, the chief executive of Action
  Bladder Cancer UK, said the charity, “bladder cancer patients and their
  families welcome this much-needed, step forward in treatments available for
  this hard-to-treat cancer. “This new drug has the potential to increase how
  long people have before their cancer gets worse and how long they live
  compared with the current, limited, treatment choices available. It’s also of
  importance that this treatment can mean these patients can experience a better
  quality of life with less hard to tolerate side effects.”
