  Mitch Brown has become the first male AFL player, past or present, to come out
  as gay or bisexual, in a step he hopes will make others in the game feel seen.
  The 36-year-old played 94 matches for West Coast in a career that ended in
  2016. He identifies as a bisexual man and is in a long-term relationship with
  a woman. Brown said it would have been difficult had he spoken publicly during
  his playing career, but was motivated to help change the culture within the
  sport. “Maybe a second person [comes out], and then the third…,” he told The
  Daily Aus. “You may be playing with someone who’s in the queer community.
  Empathy is powerful.” Adelaide’s Izak Rankine became the latest in a string of
  players banned for using homophobic slurs last week. But suspensions have been
  unable to address the root causes of the game’s struggle to accept diversity
  among its players. “What matters to me most is a sense of change, [creating] a
  movement where [players] can be anyone and be safe in any environment,” Brown
  said. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly newsletter The news was
  widely welcomed on social media. In addition to messages from fans and
  supporters, the AFL Players’ Association described the post as “powerful” and
  the GWS Giants’ account responded with a heart emoji. Pride Cup CEO Hayley
  Conway said the announcement was “an incredibly significant moment for LGBTIQ+
  communities and for AFL” while AFL/AFLW analyst and former player Kate
  McCarthy welcomed the “overwhelmingly positive” news. “To be honest, I did not
  think I would ever see the day when either an ex or current AFL men’s player
  would come out,” she said. “I felt like we were so far away from this, which
  is really, really exciting, that someone has done it. It shouldn’t take
  courage to tell the world who you are, but it is extremely courageous from
  Mitch. “In the light of what the community went through last week, I thought
  that it’s even more brave that he decided to do it around this time and to
  speak up about his experiences.” Brown grew up in Ballarat and was drafted
  into the AFL with pick 16 in 2006. The defender debuted the following year and
  spent a decade in the competition before playing his final game at age 27, an
  elimination final against the Western Bulldogs. “I got to the end of my career
  and I was asked to play on for a couple more years, and I was over it. I was
  done,” he said. “I craved talking to someone and not being judged. I craved
  the ability to choose who I wanted to be around, rather than to fit into a
  team.” He said he had “buried” questions about his own sexuality due to the
  “hyper-masculine” environment, and that slurs were so constant they “just
  became part of the normal conversation”. “There have been so many times in my
  life I’ve seen things or heard things and not said anything … in fear of
  people thinking I was gay or bisexual.” Brown said he empathises with those
  currently playing, and it is easier for him as a past player to speak up. “I
  don’t have to run out there at the MCG in front of 80,000 fans next week … and
  fear the comments being thrown at me.” Dr Erik Denison, behavioural scientist
  with Monash faculty of arts, said the way in which Brown came out – voicing
  criticism of the homophobic environment he has experienced – could be a
  watershed moment. “What’s different here with Mitch coming out is that he is
  actually talking about the problems in his sport,” Denison said. “He’s talking
  openly about the homophobic environment being a factor in him deciding to
  retire from the game. We haven’t heard that kind of direct criticism before
  from other players who have come out, including in rugby union and also
  football in Australia, and so this is an important turning point. “I’m hopeful
  this could mean that Mitch’s story might have a bigger impact than other
  players who’ve come out, because he’s a respected AFL player, an insider,
  talking about the problems in the game. He isn’t an outsider. He’s one of the
  boys, which means his words will have an impact on those within the game.” AFL
  CEO Andrew Dillon acknowledged Brown’s courage in sharing his story and how
  important the moment was for the game. “Today is a step forward, and building
  on Mitch’s story we hope that others feel encouraged to be their authentic
  selves and share their own journeys, and that these stories are met with
  support from teammates, clubs and the wider football community,” Dillon said
  in a statement. “The AFL will continue to partner with our clubs, our Pride
  and Allies groups and the LGBTQI+ community to drive and celebrate inclusion
  across both our AFL and AFLW competitions. “Together, our commitment is to
  keep making football an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone to
  thrive — and that work never stops.” In contrast to the men’s game, the AFLW
  is a diverse competition which champions its many LGBTQ+ players and the
  community.
