  We are Israeli historians teaching in Jerusalem who have been writing publicly
  about the war since early 2024. The processes that Jonathan Whittall
  describes, the result of a siege and an unprecedented assault on international
  humanitarian organisations, have been known to anyone willing to listen, in
  Israel and in the west, for a very long time (I saw many atrocities as a
  senior aid official in Gaza. Now Israeli authorities are trying to silence us,
  3 August). Israel’s siege, which has fluctuated in its totality since 7
  October, limited the amounts of food, medication and essential supplies
  allowed into the Gaza Strip, culminating in a complete siege from March to May
  2025. Israel’s assault on international organisations started with a campaign
  against Unrwa, the UN agency dedicated to the care for Palestinian refugees,
  and developed into a set of regulations aimed at intimidating international
  non-governmental organisations (INGOs) and obstructing their ability to work
  in the occupied Palestinian territories. The effect has been the replacement
  of reputable humanitarian organisations by an Israeli-funded private
  enterprise (the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation), with no experience in
  humanitarian aid or commitment to human wellbeing. The result is the reported
  starvation to death of more than 100 Palestinians and the shooting of
  Palestinians who sought aid, killing and injuring many thousands. Human life
  in the Gaza Strip has become exceedingly cheap. For us, as Israeli citizens
  who believe in the sanctity of all human life, the current moment represents
  our own failure, alongside the failure of international law, the international
  community and most media outlets. During Whittall’s term in office as head of
  the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), it has been
  an unrelenting source of information regarding the systematic assault on human
  life in the occupied territories. We applaud Whittall for speaking out. OCHA
  and other INGOs need the backing of governments and the international
  community to restore a human-oriented humanitarian system and save those who
  can still be saved. Dr Lee Mordechai History department, Hebrew University of
  Jerusalem Prof Liat Kozma Department of Islamic and Middle Eastern studies,
