  Micah Parsons is headed to the Green Bay Packers after a blockbuster trade,
  leaving the Dallas Cowboys following a protracted contract dispute. ESPN was
  first to report the deal. The Packers sent their 2026 and 2027 first-round
  picks to the Cowboys in return for Parsons, as well as Green Bay’s three-time
  Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark. A person with knowledge of the details
  told the Associated Press that the Packers and Parsons have agreed a
  four-year, $188m contract that includes $136m guaranteed. The deal makes the
  two-time All-Pro edge rusher the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.
  The contract, negotiated by agent David Mulugheta of Athletes First, will pay
  Parsons $62m in the first new year and $120m fully guaranteed at signing – all
  records for a defensive player. Parsons confirmed his departure in a statement
  posted on X. “I never wanted this chapter to end, but not everything was in my
  control,” he wrote. “My heart has always been here, and still is. Through it
  all, I never made any demands. I never asked for anything more than fairness.
  I only asked that the person I trust to negotiate my contract be part of the
  process.” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones declined to discuss the deal with
  Mulugheta, insisting publicly that he and Parsons had already agreed to
  parameters of an extension in the spring. Jones had previously dismissed trade
  speculation as “pure BS” and argued the team could retain Parsons through his
  rookie option and successive franchise tags. But Parsons had grown
  increasingly frustrated, removing Cowboys references from his social media and
  formally requesting a trade on 1 August. The rift culminated in Thursday’s
  trade. The Packers, who reached the playoffs last season behind quarterback
  Jordan Love, are adding one of the NFL’s most dominant defensive players at
  the height of his career. Parsons, 26, recorded 40.5 sacks over his first four
  seasons in Dallas and was named an All-Pro in three of them. His arrival
  recalls the 2018 deal that sent Khalil Mack from the Raiders to the Bears for
  a package of draft picks, though Parsons’ contract far surpasses Mack’s
  six-year, $141m extension. For Green Bay, the price is steep but the payoff
  could be transformative: a generational pass rusher anchoring a defense with
  Super Bowl ambitions.
