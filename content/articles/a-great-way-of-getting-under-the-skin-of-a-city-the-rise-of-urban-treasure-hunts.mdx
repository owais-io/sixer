  If you spot someone in a busy city centre street with a puzzled, possibly
  pained look asking their companions whether that’s an elephant at the top of a
  drainpipe, they are probably not mad – but on an urban treasure hunt. There
  has been, one city tourism boss said, an “explosion” in the number and
  popularity of treasure and scavenger hunts in the UK. From tracking down art
  thieves in Penzance to investigating an am-dram murder in Inverness, treasure
  hunts are a craze popular with couples, families and groups including hen
  parties. Increasingly, companies are using treasure hunts for team-building.
  Forget networking, embrace netwalking. Why book a stuffy hotel function room
  when you can work together outside and also have a drink halfway round? Most
  treasure hunts do not have prizes, apart from bragging rights, although the
  German company Komoot is this month upping the ante by staging a hunt in
  Bristol offering, it says, £32,500 in prize money. This is the summer of
  treasure hunts, and on a sunny August day the Guardian embarked on a hunt in
  York accompanied by the two men who devised it, Paul Fawkesley and Ian
  Drysdale. So, no pressure. “We’ve never tailed someone on a hunt before,” said
  Drysdale. “It could be great … or it could be moderately awkward.”
  Participants are guided round the city by a Captain Bess character who has
  heard you’re looking to join her ship, the Rising Pearl. Maps and instructions
  are sent to your phone and you search for clues and solve cryptic puzzles, all
  the time coming across things in the city most people never knew were there.
  Without giving too many secrets away, it’s fair to say there was a terrible
  start to the hunt, stemming from misunderstanding a question about degrees.
  Was the answer 360? “No.” 90? “No.” 45? “Nay, that’s not it.” Fed up, Bess
  finally gives up the answer and we quietly move on. Once you get the hang of
  the puzzles, it is enormous fun. It’s only when you’re not mindlessly milling
  along busy streets looking at shops you’re not really interested in that you
  realise how many people are doing just that. Participants are likely to see
  parts of the city they have never seen before – including, in York, an empty
  lane with arguably the best, most photographable view of York Minster. Just
  feet away are streets teeming with tourists and trickier photo opportunities.
  The pair’s company, Treasure Hunt Tours, stems from a lo-fi hunt Fawkesley
  created years ago to entertain friends when they visited him in his adopted
  home of Liverpool. Fawkesley, who has an engineering background, and Drysdale,
  with an arts background, met when they worked at a Co-op Group innovation
  unit. Soon after launching their treasure hunt business the pandemic hit, but
  they stuck with it and afterwards found a new eagerness among people to get
  out and about. They have grown and grown since, and now have treasure hunts in
  16 cities. “It does feel we are riding a wave,” said Drysdale. “People like
  them because it’s flexible and they can do it in their own time.” Business is
  good, particularly with company team-building groups, now accounting for about
  two-thirds of their clients. Drysdale said he and Fawkesley spent weeks in the
  cities traipsing round looking for stories and quirks which could be turned
  into cryptic puzzles. “We spend a lot of time on Google Maps, casing a city,
  but there is no substitute for getting out down on the ground,” he said. “We
  do a lot of legwork.” One practical reason for that is that the hunt is
  provided to people’s phones, so it is best to avoid noise and traffic. “We
  haven’t lost anyone yet,” said Fawkesley. The UK’s domestic tourism market is
  big, with the latest figures from Visit Britain suggesting 77% of people were
  planning a domestic overnight break in the past 12 months. Treasure hunts are
  a great addition to the landscape, said Emma France, the head of Marketing
  Sheffield. “I would say there’s been an explosion of them. “Five, seven years
  ago you would probably struggle to find one or two walking tours. Now treasure
  or scavenger hunts are all over the place. They are a great way of getting
  under the skin of a city that you might not have seen before.” Or even if you
  thought you knew a place, France added, recalling one she did with her
  13-year-old daughter – “she absolutely loved it” – and colleagues. “The one we
  did was really, really good fun but actually quite complicated as well. We had
  to work hard. “I probably shouldn’t say this but I’ve worked on promoting
  Sheffield in various different guises for 25 years and on the treasure hunt
  there were things I had never seen before.” Speedboats, ghosts and money
  London: the capital has many treasure hunts available, particularly for the
  booming team-building market. ClueGo even offers a chartered speedboat
  blasting along the Thames, promising a “treasure hunt with extra thrills and
  spills”. Glasgow: a ghost hunt, the evocatively named The Soul That Got Away,
  is one of a number of treasure hunts in the city. It says it blends folklore,
  mystery and exploration. “Can you reclaim your soul – or will you become just
  another story Glasgow whispers about?” Bristol: the German navigation app
  company Komoot says it is popular around the world, “but in the UK we’re just
  getting started. We want to change that, and what better way than by having
  some fun together?” The fun will be what they bill as the UK’s “most ambitious
  treasure hunt with £32,500 in real money prizes”. It takes place 19-24 August.
