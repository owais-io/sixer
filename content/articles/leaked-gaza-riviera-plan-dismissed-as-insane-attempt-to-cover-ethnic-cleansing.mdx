  A plan circulating in the White House to develop the “Gaza Riviera” as a
  string of high-tech megacities has been dismissed as an “insane” attempt to
  provide cover for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian
  territory’s population. On Sunday the Washington Post published a leaked
  prospectus for the plan, which would involve the forced displacement of Gaza’s
  entire population of 2 million people and put the territory into a US
  trusteeship for at least a decade. Named the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic
  Acceleration and Transformation Trust – or Great – the proposal was reportedly
  developed by some of the same Israelis who created and set in motion the US-
  and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation with financial planning
  contributed by Boston Consulting Group. Most controversially, the 38-page plan
  suggests what it calls “temporary relocation of all of Gaza’s more than 2
  million population” – a proposal that would amount to ethnic cleansing,
  potentially a genocidal act. Palestinians would be encouraged into “voluntary”
  departure to another country or into restricted, secure zones during
  reconstruction. Those who own land would be offered “a digital token” by the
  trust in exchange for rights to redevelop their property, to be used to
  finance a new life elsewhere. Those who stay would be housed in properties
  with a tiny footprint of 323 sq ft – minuscule even by the standards of many
  non-refugee camp homes in Gaza. It was not clear if the plan reflects US
  policy, and neither the White House nor the State Department responded to the
  Washington Post’s request for comment. But the prospectus seem to reflect
  Donald Trump’s previously stated ambition to “clean out” Gaza and redevelop
  it. Among critics of the leaked prospectus was Philip Grant, the executive
  director of Trial International, a human rights group based in Switzerland,
  who called the plan “a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as
  development”. “This is a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as
  development. The outcome? A textbook case of international crimes on an
  unimaginable scale: forcible population transfer, demographic engineering, and
  collective punishment,” Grant said. Trial is one of fifteen groups that have
  previously warned that private contractors operating in Gaza in collaboration
  with the Israeli government risk “aiding and abetting or otherwise being
  complicit in crimes under international law, including war crimes, crimes
  against humanity, or genocide”, and that they may be liable under several
  jurisdictions. “Those involved in the planning and execution of such a plan –
  including corporate actors – could face legal liability for decades to come,”
  Grant said. Even in the Israeli media the proposal invited incredulity, with a
  column in the left-leaning Haaretz describing it as “a Trumpian get-rich-quick
  scheme reliant on war crimes, AI and tourism”. The highly fanciful prospectus
  – subtitled “From a Demolished Iranian Proxy to a Prosperous Abrahamic Ally”–
  appears to have been drawn up by people with no physical knowledge of Gaza,
  the politics of the Middle East or the likely challenges in attempting to
  rebuild the territory as a multibillion-dollar tourism and technology hub that
  would inevitably compete with Israel. The scheme, described as requiring no US
  funding and intended to be funded by investors to the tune of $100bn,
  envisages a bustling port city bisected by a watercourse and bordered by up to
  eight leafy AI-powered high-tech megacities, apparently modelled after Saudi
  Arabia’s troubled Neom project. It also envisages an “Elon Musk” manufacturing
  park located – without irony – on the ruins of the Erez industrial zone, which
  was built with Israeli investment to exploit cheap labour in the Palestinian
  territory and subsequently closed and destroyed by Israeli forces. Examination
  of the map appears to suggest the plan would also involve the expropriation
  for an Israeli security buffer zone of much of Gaza’s agricultural land, which
  tends to be located at Gaza’s periphery close to the border with Israel. The
  small print is most damning, however, making no distinction in terms of
  sovereignty between Gaza, Israel and Egypt, suggesting no consideration has
  been made for Palestinian self determination. Under the plan, Israel would
  maintain vaguely defined “overarching rights” over Gaza “to meet its security
  needs”. There would be no Palestinian state but a “Palestinian polity” which
  would join Trump’s Abraham Accords. The entire language in the prospectus, and
  labelling of several features, appears aimed at appealing to the vanity of
  Trump, Musk, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, for whom the
  security ring around Gaza is named. According to the Boston Consulting Group,
  quoted by the Post, work on the document was not approved and two senior
  partners who led the financial planning had been fired. That criticism was
  echoed by HA Hellyer, a senior associate at the Royal United Services
  Institute who suggested that the details of the plan were so clearly ludicrous
  that the proposal should not be taken seriously at face value. “It’s insane.
  What is important is what the plan points to, and that is not a new idea: the
  Israel determination that there should be no Palestinian sovereignty or self
  determination in Gaza. “The US has made clear since February [when details of
  plans for a Trump Riviera in Gaza first emerged] that they are OK with the
  idea of ethnic cleansing in Gaza. “The notion that this would be about
  ‘voluntary departure’ when Palestinians in Gaza have no choice but to be shot
  or starved.” Katherine Gallagher, a senior lawyer at the Center for
  Constitutional Rights in New York, said that “any company that aligns itself
  with Israel – and seemingly, Trump – in a plan to forcibly transfer
  Palestinians from their homes in Gaza is opening itself up to significant
  legal liability at home and under universal jurisdiction”. The CCR recently
  sued the Trump administration for records of its funding of the Gaza
  Humanitarian Foundation, the private outfit overseeing aid distribution in
  Gaza and at whose sites hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while
  queuing for food. The prospectus was leaked days after Trump held a White
  House meeting to discuss day-after planning for Gaza attended by the former
  British prime minister Tony Blair, who has contributed views on Gaza’s future
  to the Trump administration and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The leaked
  plan was also rejected by senior Hamas official Basem Naim who said: “Gaza is
  not for sale. “Gaza is part of the greater Palestinian homeland.”
