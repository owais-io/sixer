  Shelbi Howell, a 32-year-old stay-at-home mom, lives in a small town outside
  of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. She is not, in any traditional sense, an
  influencer. Like millions of other women around the world, she posts her daily
  outfits to TikTok, where she has a frankly paltry 1,624 followers, and
  Instagram, where she has 1,251. Yet despite being in every sense an ordinary
  woman on the internet, Howell estimates that she has made more than $500 just
  from posting to social media. She does this by posting a video of her outfit
  or her makeup and reminding viewers – many of whom are people she knows
  personally – that they can buy the same item via a link in her bio. Howell
  uses apps called ShopMy and LTK to earn a cut of the sales for every pair of
  jeans, lip gloss or button-up shirt she inspires people to buy. These apps
  promise they can make anyone an influencer. You don’t have to be a former
  Bachelorette contestant or nepo baby to take part in flogging products to your
  fans. About 1,000 or so followers will qualify you. Representatives for
  ShopMy, which is currently valued at $410m, say that they have around 90,000
  users with less than 500,000 followers who drive $500m in sales. They position
  themselves as a creative way to make some extra cash. “We’ve always believed
  that real influence isn’t about how many followers someone has,” said
  Caley-Rae Pavillard, ShopMy’s vice-president of business development and
  partnerships. “It’s about trust, connection and the ability to move an
  audience.” Critics – and perhaps their friends and families, who grow tired of
  their posts – worry that it’s an exploitative system. “It’s almost like
  mega-influencers aren’t a safe bet anymore,” said Kate Stewart, an assistant
  professor at Jacksonville State University who studies the relationship
  between social media personalities and their audiences. “Micro-influencers
  have less of a presence, which means they have less baggage. It’s low risk.”
  Howell sees this as her in. “Smaller influencers are definitely more
  relatable,” she said. “Once you grow your following to a certain point, it’s
  hard to stay that way. I’m zoning in on being a mom. So I think it relates to
  people who might be at home and feel alone in that.” The hallmarks of
  influencer excess – posts bragging about private plane rides, free trips
  around the world and gifted designer bags – do not play as well to a general
  audience as they did 10 years ago. People are tired of watching rich people
  flaunt their wealth. Experts have dubbed it “influencer fatigue”. Redditors
  create online forums dedicated to “influencer snark”, where they gossip or
  rant about their least favorite personalities. It is also cheaper for brands
  to pay micro-influencers a few hundred dollars here and there rather than book
  top-name talent. Posts on ShopMy are nakedly transactional, converting
  friendships into tiny commissions. They are also perhaps increasingly
  unwelcome as social media transforms into one branded slop pile. Even as
  someone who studies social media, Stewart says it feels “so annoying” to watch
  an Instagram friend try to monetize something online. “We have ads in our
  streaming, on every social media platform, and now our friends are trying to
  sell to us too,” she said. “We just want somewhere that’s not trying to sell
  anything to us.” Women who used Facebook in the late aughts and 2010s might
  remember the bleak experience of receiving a “Hey babe” DM from a long-lost
  acquaintance trying to sell Younique cosmetics or LuLaRoe leggings. Many
  multi-level marketing (MLM) brands exploited women, promising them the chance
  to be their own boss and rack in outrageous pay. In reality, the vast majority
  of sellers made next to nothing – and relationships suffered. Affiliate
  marketing is not MLM, but the leveraging of friendships in order to sell
  product reminds Rebecca Haines of the controversial business strategy. “People
  use their personal networks to sell MLM products, and folks get suspicious,”
  said Haines, a professor of media and communications at Salem State
  University. “Is someone actually reaching out to me because she genuinely
  wants to connect? Or is she trying to sell me Pampered Chef?” Maddie Elder, a
  24-year-old who just moved to the US Virgin Islands for her husband’s job, is
  a part-time event planner who has always been interested in fashion. “When I
  first started getting into it, it was more influencers who used these apps,”
  Elder said. “I was definitely embarrassed, or like, scared to share. But once
  I saw that I could make money, that didn’t matter to me anymore.” Howell’s
  friends have told her they also want to start using ShopMy, but they are
  nervous about how the posts will come off. “I tell them, you just kind of have
  to do it and not care what other people think,” she said. But Haines worries
  about the potential for exploitation. Mega-influencers are paid upfront for
  their work; the people using affiliate links only get paid if people click.
  “People who turn themselves into brand ambassadors are commodifying
  themselves,” Haines said. “They’re performing a very narrow view of
  femininity, and hoping to get rewards from that. That’s a tough road.”
  Representatives for ShopMy did not share how much the average content creator
  makes through sales. The company’s commission rates vary depending on the type
  of item. Brands that are popular on social media command the highest rates – a
  Simon Miller dress yields 30% commission, while Asics sneakers get 3%. Elder
  said that in one year, she made “between” $5,000 and $10,000 through ShopMy. A
  young newlywed with no children, Howell says her commissions are “fun money”.
  It’s also cyclical. She will make money from a ShopMy item and then use the
  cash to buy more clothes – which she will eventually post on ShopMy, too.
  Elder describes it as a “reinvestment”. The money she makes goes “back into
  shopping”.
