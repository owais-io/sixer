  Pro-Palestine protesters will be legally protected while marching across the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday after a New South Wales supreme court
  decision. The bridge is expected to be closed for about five hours, from
  11.30am, and additional police are being mobilised to observe a march that
  could include up to 50,000 people. In her judgment, Justice Belinda Rigg said
  “the march at this location is motivated by the belief that the horror and
  urgency of the situation in Gaza demands an urgent and extraordinary response
  from the people of the world”. “The evidence indicates there is significant
  support for the march.” The Palestine Action Group has claimed tens of
  thousands of people will take part in the march across the bridge, protesting
  against Israel’s conduct in Gaza and the starvation of children. Celebrating
  the court’s decision, organisers declared on social media it would be an
  “immense march for humanity”. Earlier this week, police rejected an
  application from organisers for it to facilitate the march. Police argued
  there was not enough time to prepare a traffic management plan and warned of a
  potential crowd crush and huge disruptions. Speaking after the judgment, the
  NSW police deputy commissioner Peter McKenna said police were now switching to
  preparation mode. “We don’t get into the politics,” McKenna said. “We enforce
  the law of the day and tomorrow these protests have been deemed authorised, so
  we will police it in that respect.” He urged all participants to follow
  directions and said police would act on any antisocial behaviour. Public order
  and riot squad police, mounted police, traffic and highway patrol and other
  units were being called in to work, he said. “Nothing changes for us in the
  fact that [if] people … come in to do the right thing and have a safe protest,
  then we will facilitate that … we will work with them. “But if people come in
  to commit any type of offences, antisocial behaviour, or anything else that
  puts public safety at risk, we will have no hesitation to take action.”
  Officials were expecting significant disruption to roads and public transport.

  Breaking News email Once the application known as a “form 1” was rejected by
  police, the supreme court was required to decide whether the protest should be
  considered as “authorised”, which provides some legal protections to
  demonstrators. Rigg said the fact the demonstration was likely to cause
  significant inconvenience to residents and others “is far from determinative”.
  “If matters such as this were to be determinative, no assembly involving
  inconvenience would be permitted,” she said. “To deprive such groups the
  opportunity to demonstrate in an authorised public assembly would inevitably
  lead to resentment and alienation.” Rigg noted submissions from Palestine
  Action Group’s spokesperson, Josh Lees, who told the court a demonstration on
  the bridge would send an “an urgent and massive response” to the crisis in
  Gaza. “The public interest in freedom of expression, at this time, in the
  manner contemplated, for the reasons advanced, is very high,” Rigg said. Rigg
  rejected any suggestion that her decision would condone any antisocial
  behaviour or violence at the demonstration or “ambulances not getting to
  hospital on time”. In a statement, the Palestine Action Group described the
  court decision as “absolutely historic”. The group said it would provide
  further instructions to demonstrators before noon on Sunday. “This will be an
  enormous, family-friendly and safe event for everyone. The police are now
  working with us.” The court ruling means protesters will have immunity from
  being charged under the Summary Offences Act. This includes protection from
  offences like “obstructing” traffic – crucial in this particular protest.
  However, police will still have access to a range of other powers to stem
  so-called “antisocial behaviour” or other types of offending. This includes
  showing prohibited symbols. The state police minister, Yasmin Catley, said the
  government “accepted” the decision. “Police, we believe, will be able to
  handle the protest on the bridge tomorrow, so long as people are peaceful,
  that they listen to what the police ask them to do,” she said. “But make no
  mistake, there is going to be massive, massive disruption. So our message is,
  avoid the city if you can.” David Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the Human
  Rights Law Centre, said the authorisation “doesn’t give people the ability to
  engage in all types and all forms of activism”. “It’s really important for
  people who do attend that they follow the directions of organisers and
  marshals.” Rigg said a counter-protest against antisemitism, organised by the
  Christian-led group called Never Again is Now, would not be granted legal
  protections because “notice was served less than seven days before the
  proposed assembly”. The group had been planning to protest outside the Sydney
  harbour tunnel, in close proximity to the pro-Palestinian march. Rigg said
  police would have the legal power to direct this group to move on, or if
  necessary, arrest demonstrators for non-compliance. There is no authority to
  ban protest or deem it unlawful in NSW. This is because while there is no
  express right to protest in the state, it is covered in common law and by the
  Australian constitution, which the high court has found implies the right to
  freedom of political communication. The decision came after several NSW Labor
  MPs defied their premier, Chris Minns, by vowing to attend the march. Minns
  had earlier opposed the protest and said “we cannot allow Sydney to descend
  into chaos”.
