  Day two at the Oval was played in fast forward and when England are batting
  this tends to mean one of two things: either the scoreboard spinning like
  wheels on a fruit machine and pigeons flying to all parts, or the regular
  clank of spikes up and down the dressing room stairs. There was a fair bit of
  both, as it happened, plus tempers once again fraying, as the crowd witnessed
  a bun fight unfold out in the middle. But while India were initially skittled
  for 224 by the completion of Gus Atkinson’s fourth five-wicket haul in Test
  cricket, England then folded to 247 all out and an opportunity to take full
  control had gone begging. The injury Chris Woakes sustained on day one not
  only ruined his Ashes but it also left England a bowler down in this series
  finale. As well as needing to give the remainder of the attack time off their
  feet, this meant securing a decent lead. On a day when £124,000 was raised for
  Mind in memory of Graham Thorpe, here was a challenge he would have relished.
  Lasting a mere 51.2 overs and nudging just 23 runs ahead, they fell short,
  undone by the only seamer to go the distance in this brutal series. Not for
  the first time in his career when Jasprit Bumrah is missing, Mohammed Siraj
  delivered the tamasha, sharing eight wickets with the recalled Prasidh
  Krishna. Both quicks snarled their way through an afternoon in which the
  removal of six Englishmen for 106 runs swung the pendulum back to India. By
  the close, having been plunged back into the field, Ollie Pope’s three-man
  seam attack had picked up the 14th and 15th wicket of the day. But with India
  reaching 75 for two – a lead of 52 – a 2-2 series draw was still loading. If
  so – and this Test remains hugely volatile, given the seaming surface – then
  England’s approach will once again be questioned, both the high-wire batting
  and their broader propensity to unspool at the end of a series. Although the
  most productive stand came when Bazball’s lizard brain was most in play: when
  conservative thoughts are fully parked and only the upside to unfettered
  aggression is considered. After Atkinson doused the Indian tail first thing,
  Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley crunched 92 runs between them during 12.5 overs of
  morning chaos. Crawley slapped 14 fours en route to 64 from 57 balls but
  Duckett was the catalyst, with his 43 from 38 a veritable flurry of impish
  ramped sixes and charged square smacks that startled Oval’s birdlife. This
  white-knuckle ride was terminated before lunch, however, through the
  inevitable downside to all this. Duckett’s latest premeditated attempt to
  reverse scoop to Akash Deep was gloved behind – red meat for England’s
  critics, even if they will have to concede the shot’s previous profitability.
  What followed raised a few eyebrows. Deep threw an arm around Duckett’s
  shoulder and offered a few words to go with it. No one was quite sure if
  England’s opener was fine with this or simply holding firm. In a series of
  increasing bad blood, the amateur lip-readers were struggling – not that
  getting in a batter’s space after winning the contest is ever a great idea.
  There are few who relish such spice more than Siraj and when England resumed
  on 109 for one after lunch, his spiky eight-over burst of three for 35 ripped
  out of their middle order. Bowling full, and with impressive energy given the
  miles on the clock, a trio of lbws took Pope, for 22 runs, and Joe Root, 29,
  both undone by balls that jagged back and Jacob Bethell, six, yorked. Another
  sign of the rising temperature was the typically upbeat Root trading verbals
  with Krishna, triggering some Indian frustration that umpire Kumar Dharmasena
  chose only to tick off their man. But Krishna played a far more significant
  role in England’s derailment than chirp alone. Hitting 90mph on the speed gun,
  the wiry right-armer first profited from Crawley’s top-edge pull and, having
  been manhandled by Jamie Smith at Edgbaston, enjoyed some sweet revenge
  courtesy of a footwork-devoid drive to slip. When he continued Jamie Overton’s
  underwhelming return with a duck fourth ball, England stumbled into tea on 215
  for seven. Among the oddities was Harry Brook watching much of this unfold
  from the far end for what – by his standards anyway – was a relatively
  becalmed 33. The right-hander did swell this to 53, including one outrageous
  tumbling swept six. But after Atkinson came and went – and with Woakes batting
  a non-starter – he was the last to fall. Fittingly it was Siraj who shut
  things down here as another ball nipped back to rattle the stumps. The final
  18 overs continued the fast forward action. Josh Tongue ended KL Rahul’s
  series on an excellent 532 runs at 53.2, Atkinson pinned his old Surrey
  teammate Sai Sudharsan lbw late on. But Yashasvi Jaiswal ransacked a rapid 51
  not out. To sum up the day – possibly the series at large – two chances to end
  it early slipped through English fingers.
