  Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US secretary of the Department of Health and Human
  Services (HHS), defended his response to the largest measles outbreak in the
  US in 33 years in a new editorial, calling it an example of “what a focused”
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “can achieve”. Kennedy did so
  in a Wall Street Journal editorial published on Tuesday, which coincides with
  extreme tumult at the CDC and strong claims from a former employee that the
  secretary wasn’t even briefed on the measles outbreak. In the piece, Kennedy
  praises his agency’s handling of the outbreak in west Texas, which
  hospitalized nearly 100 people and killed two children earlier this year. He
  argued that the outbreak “ended quickly, proving the CDC can act swiftly with
  precision when guided by science and freed from ideology”, described the CDC’s
  response as “effective” and said that “effectiveness – not politics – will be
  the watchword of our leadership.” The outbreak, which affected several states,
  was officially declared over by local officials on 18 August. Throughout the
  crisis, Kennedy faced criticism from some health experts who described his
  messaging as inconsistent. They pointed out that while he acknowledged the
  importance of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, he also framed
  vaccination as a “personal choice” and promoted and endorsed alternative
  treatments such as vitamins and cod liver oil. The editorial arrives amid
  growing calls for his resignation, triggered by a disastrous few weeks at the
  CDC. Last week, the White House abruptly fired the CDC director, Dr Susan
  Monarez, claiming that she did not “align” with Donald Trump’s agenda. She
  also reportedly clashed with Kennedy over vaccine policy. Her ousting
  triggered the resignations of several other senior CDC officials, including Dr
  Demetre Daskalakis, the former head of the National Center for Immunization
  and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC. In a recent interview, Daskalakis even
  said that Kennedy has never been briefed by CDC experts on several health
  issues including measles, Covid-19 or the flu. “No one from my center has ever
  briefed him on any of those topics,” Daskalakis told CNN. “Perhaps he has
  alternate experts that he may trust more than the experts at CDC that the rest
  of the world regards as the best scientists in the areas. “He’s getting
  information from somewhere, but that information is not coming from CDC
  experts who really are the world’s experts in this area … and he’s not taking
  us up on several offers to brief him on these very important topics,”
  Daskalakis added. On Wednesday morning, more than 1,000 current and former HHS
  employees signed a public letter demanding Kennedy’s resignation. The letter
  accused Kennedy of putting US public health at risk and criticized his role in
  firing Monarez. It also blasts him for “appointing political ideologues” to
  influential vaccine policy positions, “refusing to be briefed by well-regarded
  CDC experts on vaccine-preventable diseases” and “rescinding the FDA’s
  emergency use authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines”. Earlier this week, nine
  former CDC officials penned a guest essay in the New York Times in which they
  called Kennedy’s leadership “unlike anything our country has ever experienced”
  and “unacceptable”. They warned that his leadership “should alarm every
  American, regardless of political leanings”, and said that “amid the largest
  measles outbreak in a generation, he’s focused on unproven treatments while
  downplaying vaccines”. Last month, more than 750 current and former HHS
  staffers sent a separate letter to Kennedy after the 8 August shooting at the
  CDC headquarters that killed a police officer. In that letter, the staffers
  accused him of fueling harassment and violence directed at government
  healthcare staff. Despite the mounting pressure, Kennedy did not address
  Monarez’s firing, the subsequent resignations or the growing calls for his
  resignation in his editorial this week. Instead, Kennedy defended the Trump
  administration’s role in what he described as “restoring public trust” in the
  CDC, which he argued had been “corroded” in recent years by “bureaucratic
  inertia, politicized science and mission creep”. Kennedy, who previously
  founded an anti-vaccine group, also criticized the CDC’s handling of the
  Covid-19 pandemic, calling it a “failure”, and blasted policies such as social
  distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, and “the suppression of low-cost
  therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs”. Kennedy is
  scheduled to testify before the Senate finance committee on Thursday for a
  hearing on Trump’s healthcare agenda, according to the committee’s website.
