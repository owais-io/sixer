  Political and religious figures in Malian city of Timbuktu have welcomed the
  return of ancient manuscripts that were removed to the capital, Bamako, more
  than a decade ago to prevent them from falling into the hands of militants
  linked to al-Qaida. According to a UN expert mission, jihadists destroyed more
  than 4,000 manuscripts and as many as nine mausoleums after occupying the
  desert city in 2012. Workers at the state-run Ahmed Baba Institute used rice
  sacks to smuggle the remaining documents out of the city a number of ways,
  including by donkey cart and motorcycle. Mali’s military junta began returning
  manuscripts on Monday, citing the threat posed to them by humidity in Bamako.
  Officials said the first tranche involved a shipment of more than 200 crates
  weighing about 5.5 tonnes. “We now have a responsibility to protect, digitise,
  study and promote these treasures so that they continue to enlighten Mali,
  Africa and the world,” the country’s higher education minister, Bouréma
  Kansaye, said at a return ceremony. Local political and religious figures who
  have been clamouring for the return of the manuscripts hailed the move. The
  documents “reflect our civilisation and spiritual and intellectual heritage”
  said Timbuktu’s deputy mayor, Diahara Touré. There appeared to be limited
  enthusiasm, however, among everyday Malians, who despite being proud of their
  cultural heritage, seem preoccupied with immediate concerns such as economic
  hardship and insecurity. The Malian army and allied Russian mercenaries hold
  Timbuktu, but the surrounding countryside remains in the control of jihadists
  who carry out regular hit-and-run raids to unsettle the government. Militants
  detonated a car bomb near the airport’s military base in June, and at least 30
  soldiers and about a dozen attackers were killed in the explosion and ensuing
  gun battle. Before the attack, authorities had attempted to show that they
  were in control by hosting diplomats in Timbuktu. The junta also plans to host
  a cultural biennale to showcase the city’s cultural heritage in December. Ulf
  Laessing, the Bamako-based head of the Sahel programme at the Konrad Adenauer
  Foundation, a German thinktank, said the government’s gestures were intended
  as a show of stability, projecting Mali’s ability to improve security. The
  militants have mostly attacked the military, but there are concerns that the
  symbolism of Timbuktu could eventually make it a tempting target. The
  manuscripts are unlikely to be targeted, but travel logistics remain fragile.
  UN and commercial flights operate weekly, but fuel shortages can strand
  passengers.
