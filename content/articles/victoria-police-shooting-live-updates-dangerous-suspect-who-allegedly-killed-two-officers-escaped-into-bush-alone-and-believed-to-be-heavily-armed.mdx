  With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Thank you for reading, if
  you are in the region tonight, please stay safe and take care. Here’s a
  summary of how events unfolded: Two people, a 59-year-old detective and a
  35-year-old senior constable, have been killed and another detective remains
  in hospital in a serious but stable condition after a shooting occurred while
  police executed a search warrant at a semi-rural property in Porepunkah,
  regional Victoria. Some 10 officers attended the property during the incident,
  which occurred at around 10.30am, with the strong police presence speaking to
  the “gravity” of the situation, Victorian police chief commissioner told
  reporters on Tuesday evening. The suspect, who lived at the property, fled the
  scene into the bush alone and remained at large and heavily armed, police
  said. The whereabouts of his partner and two children remained unknown. The
  community of Porepunkah has been advised to remain indoors as Victoria Police
  deploy every specialist resource to search for the suspect. He has not been
  named, however police expect to release images of the man “imminently”.
  Porepunkah Primary School was in lockdown earlier today however parents were
  able to pick up their children this afternoon. The nearby caravan park remains
  in lockdown, and the local pub is shut. Tributes have poured in from the prime
  minister, police bodies and emergency services around the nation to the loved
  ones of the officers who have lost their lives, and a visibly emotional mayor
  of the Alpine Shire has spoken of the “deep sorrow and shock” that has rocked
  the community. Suspect lived in bus on semi-rural property with partner and
  children, Bush says Bush says there will be a “full deployment” this evening
  to search for the suspect. Every available person is out there looking for
  this suspect. You are advised to stay indoors as this goes on … We’ll be
  reconsidering our approach and our messaging by the hour. We have nothing to
  suggest that he’s fled the area, but we are keeping a very open mind. He
  describes the suspect’s address as a semi-rural property with a bus on site,
  which housed the alleged offender, his partner and children. My message to
  that person is give yourself up so that the community can be at peace and we
  can have this matter resolved peacefully. Finally, Bush says police are likely
  to provide an image of the suspect “imminently” and concludes with: Terrible
  day for the community. Terrible day for the officers and their families, and
  Victoria Police are fully deployed to bring this matter to a peaceful
  conclusion. Thank you. Suspect known to police, shooting happened ‘over
  minutes’, Bush says Victoria chief police commissioner Mike Bush confirms the
  suspect was known to police before the shooting, which happened “over
  minutes”. The officers that were involved, the seven that were uninjured,
  remained there for hours while we locked down the area and made it secure. So
  you have to be very careful when you have an offender at large that we know to
  be armed. Asked if police discharged their weapons during the incident, Bush
  says “we’re still looking into that matter” and will share further details
  later in the investigation. There was a risk assessment done. And the fact
  that there were 10 officers attending the search warrant does talk to the
  gravity of the situation. Bush says he doesn’t believe there has been
  communication with the suspect since this morning. He doesn’t know whether a
  conversation occurred before the guns were fired, but reiterates that the
  suspect has “several” lethal firearms. Police don’t know if suspect’s wife and
  two children are with him, Bush says Bush says they are still debriefing with
  police officers on the scene to understand where the suspect’s wife and two
  children are. We have no information to suggest whether he is with or without
  them. Asked about the terrain that the suspect is in, Bush says it is
  “semi-rural” and “can be” rugged. It depends how far he has got. But we’ve got
  every resource on the ground and in the air looking for him at the moment …
  It’s [a] large [area]. We’ve got a cordon around the area … I can tell you
  that there was a risk assessment done prior to the search warrant, but I can’t
  go into any further details. Police are still examining the scene to
  understand whether he took any additional weapons from police; however, at
  this stage, he is known to be with “lethal weapons”, Bush says. The public
  should remain inside. He is obviously a very dangerous person and he needs to
  be caught. And that’s why we’ve committed every resource to do that. On to
  questions. Bush confirms that the suspect on the run is “heavily armed” and
  “we know that they are dangerous”. After shooting the three officers, Bush
  said he was able to escape into the bush “on his own”, however police are
  still searching for his partner and two children. He won’t go into further
  details about the suspect until they are apprehended. Asked how the situation
  unfolded this morning, Bush says 10 “very dedicated” police officers went to
  execute a search warrant on the address. He says the victims were “met by the
  offender and they were murdered in cold blood”. He was heavily armed and he
  was able to escape into the bush. I do understand that he was pursued … He was
  on his own, according to our police witnesses that saw him head into the bush.
  We are still looking to locate his partner and two children. Police union head
  says ‘hundreds’ of officers still at risk in search for suspect Bush hands
  over to Police Association Victoria’s chief executive, Wayne Gatt, before
  taking questions. Gatt says “hundreds of our members” continue to “put
  themselves in danger right as we speak” in an attempt to apprehend the
  suspect. Our immediate thoughts are obviously with the loved ones and the
  families of our fallen officers who were murdered today. Police stations have
  fallen silent in Victoria. There’s a shocking and eerie feeling of dread and
  indeed a sense of not knowing what to do. And that’s something that’s being
  echoed in every police station across this state right now. And indeed, as
  we’re having this press conference here today, thousands of police at home …
  will be watching this … And I do want I do want to acknowledge that we still
  have hundreds of our members putting themselves in danger right as we speak in
  an attempt to conclude this situation. Our members today paid the ultimate
  price for protecting the community. It’s the price that is often in the back
  of our minds, something we try to keep there as much as we can. Community
  should ‘stay indoors’ and ‘take care’, Bush says Bush assures the community
  that the police are doing everything they can to apprehend the suspect, and
  reiterates that they should “stay indoors” and “take care of themselves”. I
  would like to talk to the police, family and the loved ones of our lost and
  fallen officers. Myself and every member of Victoria Police are with you at
  this moment. Our hearts go out to you. We thank those courageous officers. And
  in fact we thank every police officer who comes to work every day to keep
  their communities safe, knowing that these things can and do occur. So we are
  with our officers every step of the way, and we will do everything to look
  after the families of those officers. I have received messages from all my
  commissioner colleagues across Australia who feel this as much as we do, and
  they send their support and love and offer every assistance. The suspect is
  still at large, Bush says, and police believe he is armed. He says it is the
  “priority” of the police to arrest and locate him. In terms of the current
  situation, the suspect for this horrific event is still at large. We believe
  he is armed. We have deployed every specialist resource into this area to
  locate him … Our priority is to arrest him, to ensure that he’s held to
  account for the actions but also very much to bring safety and security to
  this community. We have hundreds of police resources assigned to this very
  important task. Victoria’s chief commissioner of police, Mike Bush, is
  addressing the media from Wangaratta police station, about an hour from
  Porepunkah. He says the community and police family are grieving, and
  acknowledges the “fine and brave officers” who lost their lives in the line of
  duty. One of those officers was a 59-year-old detective. The other officer, a
  35-year-old senior constable. One of our other good officers was a detective.
  He has been shot and is currently in surgery, being treated. His injuries are
  not life threatening. WA police commissioner joins tributes to slain officers
  Western Australia’s police commissioner, Col Blanch, has joined in paying
  tribute to the officers killed and injured in today’s shooting. In a
  statement, he said: “On behalf of the entire Western Australia Police Force, I
  extend my deepest condolences to our extended blue family in Victoria Police
  today.” To the friends and loved ones of those brave officers who were killed
  in the line of duty, we grieve with you. To the officer seriously injured, and
  to your friends and loved ones, we say thank you for your sacrifice. We know
  the blue family in VICPOL will wrap their arms around those affected. Thank
  you to all of you, for what you do and the sacrifices you and your families
  make keeping your community safe. WAPOL stands with you and grieves with you.
  Victoria’s opposition leader says ‘every Australian’ is mourning with families
  of killed police officers Victoria’s opposition leader, Brad Battin, and the
  shadow minister for police, David Southwick, say “today is a tragic day”. In a
  joint statement, they said “we are all shocked and saddened” by this morning’s
  events. Two families have lost a loved one and our community has lost two
  police officers who gave their lives to keep us safe. Another officer has been
  seriously injured. Police officers know their job is dangerous – but they do
  it anyway to protect us. To the families who are mourning today, know that
  every Australian is with you. Our thoughts are also with all Victorian police
  officers who will be feeling this loss deeply. We know your work is hard. The
  dangers you face are real. And your sacrifices are often unrecognised. Today
  we acknowledge your courage. On behalf of the Victorian Opposition, we pay
  tribute to their courage, their service, and their unwavering commitment to
  protecting our community. Their memory will never be forgotten. An officer who
  was injured in this morning’s shooting is in a serious but stable condition,
  The Alfred hospital has confirmed. The officer was seriously injured after
  being shot in the lower body, Victoria police said. Two other officers were
  shot dead at the rural property. A reminder: Victoria’s police commissioner is
  expected to hold a press conference from Wangaratta, the nearest major police
  station to Porepunkah, in about 30 minutes. We will bring you the latest
  developments here. Local federal MP says ‘appalling event’ has shaken the
  nation The independent member for Indi, Helen Haines, says the community is
  “shocked and devastated by the tragedy that has unfolded in Porepunkah today”.
  Haines’ electorate covers Victoria’s Alpine region, including the township of
  Porepunkah. She said in a statement that it was the “most terrible of days”
  after the loss of two serving police officers and serious injury of a third.
  To the families and friends and colleagues of the two police officers who lost
  their lives in the line of duty, my heart breaks for your immeasurable grief …
  To the third officer seriously injured, also in the line of duty, I join in
  the prayers for your recovery … This appalling event has shaken not only
  Porepunkah, but communities right across the North East, and indeed the
  nation. While we may be geographically spread, we are close-knit, and in
  moments like this we feel the loss together. I want to acknowledge and thank
  the police and emergency services who are continuing to respond to this
  ongoing incident. I also thank the local community for their cooperation
  during the police response. In particular, the principal and staff of
  Porepunkah Primary School, who kept their students safe and calm during
  lockdown for many hours. Tributes continue to flow for slain police officers
  The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, appeared on 3AW earlier, where she sent her
  condolences to the victims of the shooting. The communities I know all across
  Victoria … indeed the whole country, will be feeling this very deeply because
  our police run towards danger; they don’t run away. And that takes a special
  kind of person and a special kind of courage. Meanwhile, the NSW police force
  has taken to social media to express sympathy to the community. Our heartfelt
  condolences go out to Victoria Police following the tragic loss of two
  officers today. We also send our support to the third officer who was
  seriously injured. Our thoughts are with their families, friends, colleagues,
  and the entire community as they navigate this profoundly difficult time.
  Ambulance Victoria has also released a statement standing “united in shock and
  sadness”. We are wrapping our arms around our own at this time and ensuring
  our paramedics and first responders who attended this incident are supported.
  As emergency service partners, we feel this tragedy deeply. We stand in
  solidarity with Victoria Police and honour the courage and commitment of the
  women and men who serve our community every day. Police union mourns
  ‘senseless murder of our mates’ The secretary of Victoria’s police
  association, Wayne Gatt, says its membership has been left “devastated” by the
  “senseless murder of our mates, colleagues and dearly loved family members”.
  These brave officers went to work today like they did every day, to protect
  the community. Their dedication to protecting the lives of others, cost them
  their own. Every officer is mourning right now, every one knows the spectre of
  self-sacrifice that follows police officers on every job they attend in every
  shift they work. They will be supporting each other and grieving as one as
  they try to make sense of this tragedy. They will go home and hug their
  families tighter than usual, in the sad and sobering knowledge that two of
  their colleagues lost that privilege in service of the community. And, they
  will rally around those families with the type of concern and care that binds
  the policing family. Gatt said the loss of officers was “difficult to
  comprehend” and the association was assisting “all of our members involved”.
  TPAV (The Police Association Victoria) … will provide any and all support to
  the families of our fallen members and their colleagues. Local MP calls deaths
  of officers ‘heartbreaking’ and ‘senseless’ acts I’ve just spoken with the
  Ovens Valley MP, Tim McCurdy, whose electorate takes in Porepunkah. He
  described the deaths of two police officers as heartbreaking and senseless:
  It’s tragic that two police officers have been killed, absolutely
  heartbreaking that this senseless act has taken place. I just feel for the
  families of those two police officers and the police officer who is in
  hospital at the moment. They walk out their door every day not knowing what
  they’re going to be confronted with. And we certainly owe an enormous amount
  to our policemen and policewomen, and I just want to say to the families that
  I’m deeply sorry for their loss. He described the area’s community as small,
  tight-knit and “reeling” over the shooting. McCrudy said: Porepunkah is on the
  edge of Bright, and we know what a tourist mecca Bright is. What you will find
  is, Porepunkah has got its own identity, but it also houses a lot of the staff
  and the workers that work up in Bright as well. It’s only 10 minutes down the
  road, but it is a small, tight knit community and they’ll be reeling. I’ve
  been speaking to different locals today. It’s still unfolding as we know, so
  until we actually get it done to a cessation, it’s still pretty scary out
  there for them … We need it to end tonight before it gets dark, hopefully and
  get to a conclusion, and then we can start to unravel what’s happened. Mike
  Bush, Victoria’s chief police commissioner, will address the media from
  Wangaratta at 6pm AEST in the first major update since the shooting unfolded
  late this morning. In a statement, Victoria police separately confirmed two on
  duty officers had been shot and killed. They were among 10 police who attended
  a property on Rayner Track, shortly after 10.30am today, police said: Two
  officers were fatally shot and a third was seriously injured after being shot
  in the lower body. At this time no other officers have been physically
  injured, however they remain at the property. The exact circumstances
  surrounding the incident are still being determined and it remains an active
  and ongoing situation. Victoria police said it was believed the alleged
  offender had since left the property. As of this afternoon, his whereabouts
  remained unknown. A significant search is actively underway to locate the man.
  We urge the public in and around the township of Porepunkah to remain indoors
  until further notice. We also ask people not to travel into the area.
  Detectives from the Homicide Squad will investigate the incident and will
  attend the scene along with detectives from the Armed Crime Squad and Fugitive
  Squad. Police from the Special Operations Group and Critical Incident Response
  Team also remain on scene. Victoria police chief commissioner says ‘all
  specialist resources’ deployed in hunt for alleged shooter Victoria police
  have released a video of the chief commissioner of police, Mike Bush, giving a
  statement confirming the deaths of two officers. He said their deaths occurred
  about 10.30am today, when a group of 10 staff attempted to execute a search
  warrant. Bush said in the video: They were fired upon. The two deceased
  officers are still at the scene. A third officer was seriously injured and is
  currently in surgery in hospital. We have deployed all specialist resources
  into the area to arrest the person responsible. Detectives, special operations
  groups are currently there looking for this person. Bush said the deaths were
  a “terribly tragic” event for the police family across Australia. I have many
  messages from colleagues around Australia, and in fact globally, we all feel
  this. My priority is to support our people out there. It’s also very important
  that we wrap ourselves around the friends and family and colleagues of these
  officers who so bravely gave their lives to support their communities. He also
  urged rural communities around Bright that police were doing “everything to
  bring this person into custody so that your community is safe”. Bush said: Can
  I please ask you just to stay at home, not go out and about at the moment,
  until this operation is concluded. I’m leaving now to head to the area to
  support our officers and support the operation. Thank you. No arrests or
  charged had been laid. Police again advise avoiding area as organisation for
  families of fallen officers sends ‘heartfelt condolences’ Victoria police have
  provided another statement confirming the incident remains “active” and that
  the response is continuing. People are still being told to avoid the area.
  Meanwhile, Victoria Police Legacy, a not-for-profit for police families who
  have lost a loved one, says it is “deeply saddened” after the death of two
  officers. Its board, CEO, staff, ambassadors and volunteers said in a
  statement: Our heartfelt condolences to their families, work colleagues and
  friends. We also extend our thoughts to their injured colleague and to all
  those in the emergency services family who attended the tragic scene.
  Porepunkah Pub to remain closed, offers meals to police on scene
  Unsurprisingly, the Porepunkah Pub will not be opening to the public today. A
  community notice uploaded to social media said: Due to recent incidents in the
  area and following advice from Victorian Police, the Porepunkah Pub will be
  closed tonight. The safety of our staff, guests, and community is our
  priority. We’ll provide updates as more information becomes available and look
  forward to welcoming you back soon. Stay safe, The Porepunkah Pub Team The pub
  is located less than 5km from the rural property where the shooting took
  place, close to the centre of town on the banks of the Ovens River. The team
  also confirmed they had offered to prepare meals for police officers on the
  scene. Almost all students collected from Porepunkah primary school Almost all
  students at Porepunkah primary school have returned home, its principal, Jill
  Gillies, has confirmed. Speaking on ABC Melbourne, Gillies said it had been a
  “massive day” for students and staff, while adding they had “coped really
  well” to keep things as calm as possible. The kids are almost all off site. A
  few of the staff members’ kids are still with their parents, but otherwise
  everyone’s home, safe and sound … It’s been quite an ordeal. Four students who
  live in the area “affected by the incident” remain at the school at this
  stage, she said. We were just given instruction that we could start having
  students collected – the students that are the local ones, that live in the
  area affected by the incident, are still with us. The mayor of the Alpine
  Shire, Sarah Nicholas, has just released a video statement online. In it, she
  said: Today has been a day of deep sorrow and shock for our community. First
  and foremost, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the families, friends,
  and colleagues of the two police officers tragically killed in Porepunkah. Our
  thoughts, love, and unwavering support are with you during this incredibly
  painful time. We hold our police in the highest regard. They serve with
  courage, compassion, and dedication, and their loss is felt profoundly across
  our region. We are deeply grateful for their service and commitment. A visibly
  emotional Nicholas acknowledged it had been an “unsettling and emotional” day
  for the wider community. She continued: Thank you for your patience, your
  understanding, and for continuing to follow police instructions to stay safe.
  Your care for one another is what makes our Shire so strong. To our wonderful
  teachers: thank you for being a steady and calming presence for our children
  during today’s lockdowns. Your kindness and reassurance have made a world of
  difference in helping our young ones feel safe and supported. She said all
  council facilities would remain closed until further notice, and a council
  meeting planned for tonight was cancelled. We will keep our community informed
  as services resume. We are grieving together, and we will continue to support
  one another with compassion and care. Please stay safe. Caravan park near
  Porepunkah shooting site in ‘indefinite’ lockdown Emily White, a manager at
  Mount Buffalo caravan park, says the site is in lockdown. White, whose family
  also manages the nearby Riverview caravan park, said police had told everyone
  to remain at the site. We have been told we can’t go out. No one came come in.
  We don’t know how long. It’s indefinite right now. White said a nearby
  checkpoint, about 500m from the Mount Buffalo Caravan Park, could only be
  passed by police officers. Meanwhile, the ABC is reporting that parents are
  able to pick up their children from Porepunkah primary school, which had been
  in lockdown since this morning. Almost two dozen police cars at site of
  shooting as helicopter conducts search, airfield officer says Earlier, we
  reported that Porepunkah airfield was closed due to the emergency response.
  Its airfield active reporting officer, Mark Simpson, appeared on ABC Melbourne
  radio earlier to provide an update on the unfolding situation. He said from
  his location, at a roundabout near the incident site, en route to the
  airfield, he could see about 15 stationary police cars and seven or eight
  undercover police cars. The roundabout also leads into the nearby township of
  Mount Buffalo. A helicopter continued to search the area, Simpson said. He has
  been told to remain put. [The helicopter] has taken off from the airfield,
  been refuelled and is still searching for a person. One person treated for
  ‘serious lower body injuries’, Ambulance Victoria confirms. Ambulance Victoria
  has released a statement about its response to the Porepunkah shooting. A
  spokesperson confirmed paramedics were at the scene. Paramedics have treated
  one person for serious lower body injuries and transported [them] by air
  ambulance in a stable condition. Porepunkah airfield closed due to ‘emergency
  response’ The Porepunkah airfield has confirmed it has been closed due to the
  ongoing “emergency response”. Police and emergency services still have access.
  The airfield is situated two nautical miles south of the Porepunkah township,
  east of Mt. Buffalo national park. It is usually home to general and
  recreational aircraft, trikes, sailplanes, paramotors and radio-controlled
  models. Earlier, the airfield active reporting officer, Mark Simpson, told
  Guardian Australia he was stuck at the roundabout near the incident amid about
  10 police vehicles, as the road heading south had been blocked off. Helicopter
  continuing to circle over Porepunkah, police reportedly on scene in camouflage
  gear ABC Goulburn Murray reporter Erin Somerville is speaking to ABC Melbourne
  radio to provide an update from the scene, which she says is “eerily still”.
  There are still dozens of police here at Porepunkah on a major tourist
  roundabout … We’ve recently, in the last hour, seen a very big, large,
  armoured police vehicle pass by, heading towards Mount Buffalo. We’ve also
  seen a number of police cars head down to a paddock towards the mountains.
  It’s very steep, very dense, very mountainous terrain … We still currently
  have a helicopter circling above a paddock just across the road from a very
  popular caravan park … into the foothills, which lead into Mount Buffalo … We
  also have a range of tactical support that have come in … We have what appear
  to be undercover police officers as well. We also saw one or two police
  officers who were wearing what looked like camouflage gear. Somerville said
  hikers had disappeared “for days” in the landscape, who had “wanted to be
  found”, so thick was the terrain. To recap, here’s what we know so far: The
  police were attending a rural property about 300km north-east of Melbourne on
  Tuesday to serve a warrant. Two officers have been killed and another wounded.
  Wangaratta police said there was still an “active incident” and have urged
  people to avoid the area. The local council closed all council facilities
  “effective immediately” and Porepunkah primary school remained in lockdown.
  The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said the thoughts of “all Victorians”
  were with the police, saying the response showed first responders’
  “extraordinary bravery and courage”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese,
  said his thoughts were with the “police for the work they do, each and every
  day”. He said “the men and women who wear the uniform of the police take
  risks” for everyone. The ABC has reported a strong police presence in the
  area, with about 50 officers in uniform and plainclothes in the vicinity. A
  police dog was also reportedly on site. Queensland premier sends ‘thoughts and
  prayers’ to Porepunkah Queensland’s premier, David Crisafulli, has sent
  “thoughts and prayers” to Victoria police after the confirmation of the deaths
  of two police officers. Posting to X, Crisafulli said: The thoughts and
  prayers of Queenslanders are with the Victorian Police family this afternoon.
  Police face dangers every day to keep us safe. This incident is another tragic
  reminder of that. The community of Porepunkah and all those impacted by this
  tragedy are in our hearts today. Victoria police has again confirmed that
  officers continue to respond to the incident, which remains active, and are
  asking people to avoid the area. What Porepunkah and the Alpine region are
  like At this time of year, Victoria’s High Country is usually home to keen
  holidaymakers visiting the region for official snow season in resort towns
  like Falls Creek, Mount Hotham and Dinner Plain. Bright, less than 10km from
  Porepunkah, is a regular stop for tourists, famous for its cycling routes,
  breweries and boutique stores. Despite its small size, Porepunkah also picks
  up its share of tourism, part of the Murray to Mountains rail trail and
  featuring a number of cellar doors, produce and picnic options, as well as
  providing an easy entry point to the ski town of Mount Buffalo. But it’s a
  different scene today, with dozens of officers amassing on the region from
  Wangaratta and Wodonga. The site of the incident is close to a number of
  caravan parks, motels and accommodation options, as well as the popular
  Porepunkah Pub. Students at Porepunkah Primary School being distracted with
  movies and coding, principal says Porepunkah Primary School is still in
  lockdown as the end of the school day approaches, its principal has confirmed.
  Speaking on ABC Melbourne radio, Jill Gillies said about 90 students were
  being distracted with movies, coding and touch typing. Teachers are absolute
  superstars and I have the best bunch of staff, they’ve had the kids in
  lockdown since around 11.30 this morning, they are masters at being able to be
  creative to find fun things to engage the kids and distract. Our teachers are
  amazing and the kids are super resilient. Gillies said the school was awaiting
  direction from the police over the length of the lockdown but children would
  be able to remain overnight if needed. We have food and access to toilets and
  comfort items … let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. We have to wait direction
  from the police, we’re really unsure at this stage. I just keep letting our
  parents know that we’re still in lockdown and I’ll keep them informed as we
  get closer to [the school day ending]. ‘We stand with you’: Victorian
  opposition leader pays tribute to emergency services The opposition leader,
  Brad Battin, has also made a statement to parliament. He says his thoughts are
  with all Victorian emergency services across the state: We know with an active
  situation up there, it’s not just the emergency services, it’s the local
  community that is impacted. We hear of lockdowns in schools. We send out our
  thoughts to the families, the parents and everyone involved with those schools
  as well … We hope there is a quick resolution and more information comes out
  as soon as possible, but to every single Victoria police officer today, we
  stand with you, we stand beside you and we’ll continue to. Victoria’s premier,
  Jacinta Allan, is beginning parliament’s question time with a brief statement
  on the Porepunkah shooting. She says: A police operation is currently under
  way in Porepunkah in Victoria’s north-east. The police minister and I have
  been briefed by the chief commissioner of the Victoria police and this
  situation remains active. Victoria police officers and all of our first
  responders show extraordinary bravery and courage every single day. They are
  the best of us. I do ask the Victorian community, particularly those in that
  beautiful part of the north-east of our state, to follow the advice of
  Victoria police. More information will be provided by Victoria police to the
  Victorian community as it becomes available. It’s worth noting Allan has
  changed into a black suit – she was previously dressed in red at a press
  conference this morning. Australian Federal Police Association stands ready to
  support Victorian officers The Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA)
  has separately confirmed that one officer has been wounded and two others are
  believed, but not confirmed, to be deceased after police executed a warrant at
  a rural property in Porepunkah. This is an active and unfolding situation,
  with emergency services working tirelessly to secure the area and keep the
  community safe. Its president, Alex Caruana, said the association and its
  4,000-plus members stood in solidarity with its Victorian counterparts. Our
  members across the country are thinking of Victoria Police and their families
  today. Policing is dangerous and unpredictable work, and what has happened in
  Porepunkah is a reminder of the risks officers face every day in keeping the
  community safe. The AFPA is ready to support The Police Association Victoria
  (TPAV) and stands prepared if required. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our
  TPAV and Victoria Police colleagues and their loved ones as more details
  emerge. Victoria’s premier says the state’s thoughts are with the police
  force, situation remains active The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, says the
  thoughts of “all Victorians” are with Victoria police in her first public
  statement on the incident. Posting to X, Allan urged the community to follow
  the advice of Victoria police and avoid the area: A police operation is
  currently underway in Porepunkah, in Victoria’s Northeast. I have been briefed
  by the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police. This situation remains active.
  Victoria Police officers, and all our first responders, show extraordinary
  bravery and courage every single day. They are the best of us – and the
  thoughts of all Victorians are with them today. Please follow the advice of
  Victoria Police and avoid the area. More information will be provided as it
  becomes available. Three sources have confirmed to Guardian Australia that two
  officers have been killed and another wounded in the shooting at Porepunkah.
  None were authorised to comment on the incident and only one had been directly
  briefed on the incident by police. Victoria police has declined to comment on
  the “active” incident” until it is operationally safe to do so. Dozens of
  police officers in vicinity of incident, ABC reports The Police Association
  Victoria has released a statement noting it is aware of a “critical incident”
  that has unfolded in the north-eastern part of the state which is affecting
  its members. We have sent critical incident support teams to the area to
  assist and support the impacted members, their families and colleagues. It
  comes as the ABC is reporting a strong police presence of about 50 officers in
  uniform and plainclothes in the vicinity of the incident. An ABC reporter in
  the area told the public broadcaster’s news channel that in the past 10
  minutes, a large contingent of officers took off on the road behind them. A
  dog from a police squad was also released into a nearby paddock. Media have
  been directed to a cordoned off area as the situation continues to unfold, the
  reporter said: When I did speak to police earlier, they did indicate that the
  heavy police presence had come from across the region, as you can imagine, to
  help out with this unfolding incident. We’re still seeing police cars coming
  in from the direction of Wodonga and Wangaratta as I’m speaking to you. I
  followed police cars the whole way from Wodonga. The HM5 air ambulance has
  just taken off again and is heading back to Melbourne, while a police chopper
  is also on the move. Wangaratta police have confirmed there is still an
  “active incident” ongoing and are continuing to urge people to avoid the area.
  In a statement published to its social media page a moment ago, the local
  police service said Victoria police “continues to respond to an incident at a
  property in Porepunkah”. This is still an active incident and we will provide
  more information when it’s operationally safe to do so. We ask people avoid
  the area. The Alpine shire council has closed all council facilities
  “effective immediately” as a result of the unfolding incident. In a statement,
  the council, which covers an area of 4,788 sq km including Bright, Dinner
  Plain, Mount Beauty, Myrtleford and Porepunkah, said the closures included all
  transfer stations, libraries, visitor information centres and depots across
  the shire, as well as the Bright sports centre. Tonight’s Ordinary Council
  Meeting has also been postponed, and will be rescheduled for two weeks’ time.
  Further details will be provided at a later date. We thank you for your
  patience and understanding. We’ll update the community when our services
  resume. Circling back to the press conference, the Australian federal police
  commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said there were “grave concerns” for some of the
  police officers involved in the incident. Just from the police blue family,
  the wider family across Australia and overseas, our thoughts and prayers are
  with Victoria police right now. And we hope that they are all safe and well,
  however, we’re hearing there are some grave concerns for some of those police
  officers and our hearts go out to the community. Thank you, PM, for your kind
  words. According to the flight radar, a HM5 air ambulance is coming in to land
  in the area of Porepunkah now. Another chopper in the region appears to be a
  police aircraft heading straight to the township. The prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, is addressing the media now from Parliament House. He began his
  press conference expressing concern for police officers involved in the
  incident. Our thoughts are with the police for the work they do, each and
  every day. The men and women who wear … the uniform of the police take risks
  each and every day. The Victorian police commissioner will be providing
  updates during the afternoon as more facts that are able to be released become
  clear. Victoria’s opposition leader sends thanks to state’s police officers
  The Victorian opposition leader, Brad Battin, says his thoughts are with the
  police community following reports an officer has been injured in Porepunkah.
  Speaking at parliament, he told reporters: We’re seeing news, tragic news is
  happening up in the north of Victoria, and we want to send our thoughts and
  our strength out to Victoria police members who are hearing some of the news
  coming through at the moment, we know that when Victoria police members get
  out of bed every day and go to work, they go to work with risk … Events like
  this will impact each and every police officer across Victoria and across
  Australia, but will also put a massive impact on the families who are at the
  moment hearing the news come out that is currently happening. Each and every
  day, Victoria police members go out in the face of danger. Each and every day
  they know the risks, and today, we want to send out our thanks to all of them,
  but more importantly, our thoughts to everyone as events unfold up in the
  north. The township of Porepunkah is around 300km north-east of Melbourne. It
  is less than 10km from the popular tourist destination of Bright, in
  Victoria’s alpine region. Police issue statement over ‘active and ongoing
  incident’ Here is the statement from Victoria police into what they are
  describing as an “active and ongoing incident”. Police are currently at a
  property in Porepunkah … We will provide more information when it’s
  operationally safe to do so. We ask people avoid the area. This is an active
  and ongoing incident which may present significant risk to members of the
  public. We are asking that you do not attend the scene at this time. According
  to the ABC, locals have been reporting a large amount of police cars in the
  vicinity of the incident, which is less than 1km from Porepunkah Primary
  School. The school, attended by about 100 students, is currently in lockdown,
  the ABC reports. Its principal, Jill Gillies, appeared on ABC radio Melbourne
  a short time ago to assure listeners the school community was safe. She said
  the school went into pre-emptive lockdown about 11.30am. We were told that
  there was a situation unfolding so for the safety of the kids and to keep
  everything nice and calm we went into lockdown. [The kids] are fantastic, we
  do drills all the time, we have an emergency management plan which we enacted,
  we got into the classrooms really quickly, drew down our blinds, locked doors
  and made sure everyone was accounted for. Gillies said teachers had made sure
  all students were doing something “really fun” to keep them distracted. I know
  it’s a worry to everyone but I just want to assure everyone that we’re all
  safe and calm. According to the latest census, the small township of
  Porepunkah is home to about 1,000 people. Police are attending an “active
  incident” at a rural property in Victoria, after media reports an officer had
  been injured in a shooting. Officers attended a property at Porepunkah, in the
  state’s Alpine region, about 300km north-east of Melbourne on Tuesday morning
  to serve a warrant, The Age reported. One officer was shot in the thigh and
  two were unaccounted for, the report said. In a statement, Victoria police
  would not confirm those details but did say that officers were at a property
  in Porepunkah: This is still an active incident and we will provide more
  information when it’s operationally safe to do so.

With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Thank you for reading, if you are in the region tonight, please stay safe and take care. Here’s a summary of how events unfolded: Two people, a 59-year-old detective and a 35-year-old senior constable, have been killed and another detective remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition after a shooting occurred while police executed a search warrant at a semi-rural property in Porepunkah, regional Victoria. Some 10 officers attended the property during the incident, which occurred at around 10.30am, with the strong police presence speaking to the “gravity” of the situation, Victorian police chief commissioner told reporters on Tuesday evening. The suspect, who lived at the property, fled the scene into the bush alone and remained at large and heavily armed, police said. The whereabouts of his partner and two children remained unknown. The community of Porepunkah has been advised to remain indoors as Victoria Police deploy every specialist resource to search for the suspect. He has not been named, however police expect to release images of the man “imminently”. Porepunkah Primary School was in lockdown earlier today however parents were able to pick up their children this afternoon. The nearby caravan park remains in lockdown, and the local pub is shut. Tributes have poured in from the prime minister, police bodies and emergency services around the nation to the loved ones of the officers who have lost their lives, and a visibly emotional mayor of the Alpine Shire has spoken of the “deep sorrow and shock” that has rocked the community. Suspect lived in bus on semi-rural property with partner and children, Bush says Bush says there will be a “full deployment” this evening to search for the suspect. Every available person is out there looking for this suspect. You are advised to stay indoors as this goes on … We’ll be reconsidering our approach and our messaging by the hour. We have nothing to suggest that he’s fled the area, but we are keeping a very open mind. He describes the suspect’s address as a semi-rural property with a bus on site, which housed the alleged offender, his partner and children. My message to that person is give yourself up so that the community can be at peace and we can have this matter resolved peacefully. Finally, Bush says police are likely to provide an image of the suspect “imminently” and concludes with: Terrible day for the community. Terrible day for the officers and their families, and Victoria Police are fully deployed to bring this matter to a peaceful conclusion. Thank you. Suspect known to police, shooting happened ‘over minutes’, Bush says Victoria chief police commissioner Mike Bush confirms the suspect was known to police before the shooting, which happened “over minutes”. The officers that were involved, the seven that were uninjured, remained there for hours while we locked down the area and made it secure. So you have to be very careful when you have an offender at large that we know to be armed. Asked if police discharged their weapons during the incident, Bush says “we’re still looking into that matter” and will share further details later in the investigation. There was a risk assessment done. And the fact that there were 10 officers attending the search warrant does talk to the gravity of the situation. Bush says he doesn’t believe there has been communication with the suspect since this morning. He doesn’t know whether a conversation occurred before the guns were fired, but reiterates that the suspect has “several” lethal firearms. Police don’t know if suspect’s wife and two children are with him, Bush says Bush says they are still debriefing with police officers on the scene to understand where the suspect’s wife and two children are. We have no information to suggest whether he is with or without them. Asked about the terrain that the suspect is in, Bush says it is “semi-rural” and “can be” rugged. It depends how far he has got. But we’ve got every resource on the ground and in the air looking for him at the moment … It’s [a] large [area]. We’ve got a cordon around the area … I can tell you that there was a risk assessment done prior to the search warrant, but I can’t go into any further details. Police are still examining the scene to understand whether he took any additional weapons from police; however, at this stage, he is known to be with “lethal weapons”, Bush says. The public should remain inside. He is obviously a very dangerous person and he needs to be caught. And that’s why we’ve committed every resource to do that. On to questions. Bush confirms that the suspect on the run is “heavily armed” and “we know that they are dangerous”. After shooting the three officers, Bush said he was able to escape into the bush “on his own”, however police are still searching for his partner and two children. He won’t go into further details about the suspect until they are apprehended. Asked how the situation unfolded this morning, Bush says 10 “very dedicated” police officers went to execute a search warrant on the address. He says the victims were “met by the offender and they were murdered in cold blood”. He was heavily armed and he was able to escape into the bush. I do understand that he was pursued … He was on his own, according to our police witnesses that saw him head into the bush. We are still looking to locate his partner and two children. Police union head says ‘hundreds’ of officers still at risk in search for suspect Bush hands over to Police Association Victoria’s chief executive, Wayne Gatt, before taking questions. Gatt says “hundreds of our members” continue to “put themselves in danger right as we speak” in an attempt to apprehend the suspect. Our immediate thoughts are obviously with the loved ones and the families of our fallen officers who were murdered today. Police stations have fallen silent in Victoria. There’s a shocking and eerie feeling of dread and indeed a sense of not knowing what to do. And that’s something that’s being echoed in every police station across this state right now. And indeed, as we’re having this press conference here today, thousands of police at home … will be watching this … And I do want I do want to acknowledge that we still have hundreds of our members putting themselves in danger right as we speak in an attempt to conclude this situation. Our members today paid the ultimate price for protecting the community. It’s the price that is often in the back of our minds, something we try to keep there as much as we can. Community should ‘stay indoors’ and ‘take care’, Bush says Bush assures the community that the police are doing everything they can to apprehend the suspect, and reiterates that they should “stay indoors” and “take care of themselves”. I would like to talk to the police, family and the loved ones of our lost and fallen officers. Myself and every member of Victoria Police are with you at this moment. Our hearts go out to you. We thank those courageous officers. And in fact we thank every police officer who comes to work every day to keep their communities safe, knowing that these things can and do occur. So we are with our officers every step of the way, and we will do everything to look after the families of those officers. I have received messages from all my commissioner colleagues across Australia who feel this as much as we do, and they send their support and love and offer every assistance. The suspect is still at large, Bush says, and police believe he is armed. He says it is the “priority” of the police to arrest and locate him. In terms of the current situation, the suspect for this horrific event is still at large. We believe he is armed. We have deployed every specialist resource into this area to locate him … Our priority is to arrest him, to ensure that he’s held to account for the actions but also very much to bring safety and security to this community. We have hundreds of police resources assigned to this very important task. Victoria’s chief commissioner of police, Mike Bush, is addressing the media from Wangaratta police station, about an hour from Porepunkah. He says the community and police family are grieving, and acknowledges the “fine and brave officers” who lost their lives in the line of duty. One of those officers was a 59-year-old detective. The other officer, a 35-year-old senior constable. One of our other good officers was a detective. He has been shot and is currently in surgery, being treated. His injuries are not life threatening. WA police commissioner joins tributes to slain officers Western Australia’s police commissioner, Col Blanch, has joined in paying tribute to the officers killed and injured in today’s shooting. In a statement, he said: “On behalf of the entire Western Australia Police Force, I extend my deepest condolences to our extended blue family in Victoria Police today.” To the friends and loved ones of those brave officers who were killed in the line of duty, we grieve with you. To the officer seriously injured, and to your friends and loved ones, we say thank you for your sacrifice. We know the blue family in VICPOL will wrap their arms around those affected. Thank you to all of you, for what you do and the sacrifices you and your families make keeping your community safe. WAPOL stands with you and grieves with you. Victoria’s opposition leader says ‘every Australian’ is mourning with families of killed police officers Victoria’s opposition leader, Brad Battin, and the shadow minister for police, David Southwick, say “today is a tragic day”. In a joint statement, they said “we are all shocked and saddened” by this morning’s events. Two families have lost a loved one and our community has lost two police officers who gave their lives to keep us safe. Another officer has been seriously injured. Police officers know their job is dangerous – but they do it anyway to protect us. To the families who are mourning today, know that every Australian is with you. Our thoughts are also with all Victorian police officers who will be feeling this loss deeply. We know your work is hard. The dangers you face are real. And your sacrifices are often unrecognised. Today we acknowledge your courage. On behalf of the Victorian Opposition, we pay tribute to their courage, their service, and their unwavering commitment to protecting our community. Their memory will never be forgotten. An officer who was injured in this morning’s shooting is in a serious but stable condition, The Alfred hospital has confirmed. The officer was seriously injured after being shot in the lower body, Victoria police said. Two other officers were shot dead at the rural property. A reminder: Victoria’s police commissioner is expected to hold a press conference from Wangaratta, the nearest major police station to Porepunkah, in about 30 minutes. We will bring you the latest developments here. Local federal MP says ‘appalling event’ has shaken the nation The independent member for Indi, Helen Haines, says the community is “shocked and devastated by the tragedy that has unfolded in Porepunkah today”. Haines’ electorate covers Victoria’s Alpine region, including the township of Porepunkah. She said in a statement that it was the “most terrible of days” after the loss of two serving police officers and serious injury of a third. To the families and friends and colleagues of the two police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty, my heart breaks for your immeasurable grief … To the third officer seriously injured, also in the line of duty, I join in the prayers for your recovery … This appalling event has shaken not only Porepunkah, but communities right across the North East, and indeed the nation. While we may be geographically spread, we are close-knit, and in moments like this we feel the loss together. I want to acknowledge and thank the police and emergency services who are continuing to respond to this ongoing incident. I also thank the local community for their cooperation during the police response. In particular, the principal and staff of Porepunkah Primary School, who kept their students safe and calm during lockdown for many hours. Tributes continue to flow for slain police officers The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, appeared on 3AW earlier, where she sent her condolences to the victims of the shooting. The communities I know all across Victoria … indeed the whole country, will be feeling this very deeply because our police run towards danger; they don’t run away. And that takes a special kind of person and a special kind of courage. Meanwhile, the NSW police force has taken to social media to express sympathy to the community. Our heartfelt condolences go out to Victoria Police following the tragic loss of two officers today. We also send our support to the third officer who was seriously injured. Our thoughts are with their families, friends, colleagues, and the entire community as they navigate this profoundly difficult time. Ambulance Victoria has also released a statement standing “united in shock and sadness”. We are wrapping our arms around our own at this time and ensuring our paramedics and first responders who attended this incident are supported. As emergency service partners, we feel this tragedy deeply. We stand in solidarity with Victoria Police and honour the courage and commitment of the women and men who serve our community every day. Police union mourns ‘senseless murder of our mates’ The secretary of Victoria’s police association, Wayne Gatt, says its membership has been left “devastated” by the “senseless murder of our mates, colleagues and dearly loved family members”. These brave officers went to work today like they did every day, to protect the community. Their dedication to protecting the lives of others, cost them their own. Every officer is mourning right now, every one knows the spectre of self-sacrifice that follows police officers on every job they attend in every shift they work. They will be supporting each other and grieving as one as they try to make sense of this tragedy. They will go home and hug their families tighter than usual, in the sad and sobering knowledge that two of their colleagues lost that privilege in service of the community. And, they will rally around those families with the type of concern and care that binds the policing family. Gatt said the loss of officers was “difficult to comprehend” and the association was assisting “all of our members involved”. TPAV (The Police Association Victoria) … will provide any and all support to the families of our fallen members and their colleagues. Local MP calls deaths of officers ‘heartbreaking’ and ‘senseless’ acts I’ve just spoken with the Ovens Valley MP, Tim McCurdy, whose electorate takes in Porepunkah. He described the deaths of two police officers as heartbreaking and senseless: It’s tragic that two police officers have been killed, absolutely heartbreaking that this senseless act has taken place. I just feel for the families of those two police officers and the police officer who is in hospital at the moment. They walk out their door every day not knowing what they’re going to be confronted with. And we certainly owe an enormous amount to our policemen and policewomen, and I just want to say to the families that I’m deeply sorry for their loss. He described the area’s community as small, tight-knit and “reeling” over the shooting. McCrudy said: Porepunkah is on the edge of Bright, and we know what a tourist mecca Bright is. What you will find is, Porepunkah has got its own identity, but it also houses a lot of the staff and the workers that work up in Bright as well. It’s only 10 minutes down the road, but it is a small, tight knit community and they’ll be reeling. I’ve been speaking to different locals today. It’s still unfolding as we know, so until we actually get it done to a cessation, it’s still pretty scary out there for them … We need it to end tonight before it gets dark, hopefully and get to a conclusion, and then we can start to unravel what’s happened. Mike Bush, Victoria’s chief police commissioner, will address the media from Wangaratta at 6pm AEST in the first major update since the shooting unfolded late this morning. In a statement, Victoria police separately confirmed two on duty officers had been shot and killed. They were among 10 police who attended a property on Rayner Track, shortly after 10.30am today, police said: Two officers were fatally shot and a third was seriously injured after being shot in the lower body. At this time no other officers have been physically injured, however they remain at the property. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident are still being determined and it remains an active and ongoing situation. Victoria police said it was believed the alleged offender had since left the property. As of this afternoon, his whereabouts remained unknown. A significant search is actively underway to locate the man. We urge the public in and around the township of Porepunkah to remain indoors until further notice. We also ask people not to travel into the area. Detectives from the Homicide Squad will investigate the incident and will attend the scene along with detectives from the Armed Crime Squad and Fugitive Squad. Police from the Special Operations Group and Critical Incident Response Team also remain on scene. Victoria police chief commissioner says ‘all specialist resources’ deployed in hunt for alleged shooter Victoria police have released a video of the chief commissioner of police, Mike Bush, giving a statement confirming the deaths of two officers. He said their deaths occurred about 10.30am today, when a group of 10 staff attempted to execute a search warrant. Bush said in the video: They were fired upon. The two deceased officers are still at the scene. A third officer was seriously injured and is currently in surgery in hospital. We have deployed all specialist resources into the area to arrest the person responsible. Detectives, special operations groups are currently there looking for this person. Bush said the deaths were a “terribly tragic” event for the police family across Australia. I have many messages from colleagues around Australia, and in fact globally, we all feel this. My priority is to support our people out there. It’s also very important that we wrap ourselves around the friends and family and colleagues of these officers who so bravely gave their lives to support their communities. He also urged rural communities around Bright that police were doing “everything to bring this person into custody so that your community is safe”. Bush said: Can I please ask you just to stay at home, not go out and about at the moment, until this operation is concluded. I’m leaving now to head to the area to support our officers and support the operation. Thank you. No arrests or charged had been laid. Police again advise avoiding area as organisation for families of fallen officers sends ‘heartfelt condolences’ Victoria police have provided another statement confirming the incident remains “active” and that the response is continuing. People are still being told to avoid the area. Meanwhile, Victoria Police Legacy, a not-for-profit for police families who have lost a loved one, says it is “deeply saddened” after the death of two officers. Its board, CEO, staff, ambassadors and volunteers said in a statement: Our heartfelt condolences to their families, work colleagues and friends. We also extend our thoughts to their injured colleague and to all those in the emergency services family who attended the tragic scene. Porepunkah Pub to remain closed, offers meals to police on scene Unsurprisingly, the Porepunkah Pub will not be opening to the public today. A community notice uploaded to social media said: Due to recent incidents in the area and following advice from Victorian Police, the Porepunkah Pub will be closed tonight. The safety of our staff, guests, and community is our priority. We’ll provide updates as more information becomes available and look forward to welcoming you back soon. Stay safe, The Porepunkah Pub Team The pub is located less than 5km from the rural property where the shooting took place, close to the centre of town on the banks of the Ovens River. The team also confirmed they had offered to prepare meals for police officers on the scene. Almost all students collected from Porepunkah primary school Almost all students at Porepunkah primary school have returned home, its principal, Jill Gillies, has confirmed. Speaking on ABC Melbourne, Gillies said it had been a “massive day” for students and staff, while adding they had “coped really well” to keep things as calm as possible. The kids are almost all off site. A few of the staff members’ kids are still with their parents, but otherwise everyone’s home, safe and sound … It’s been quite an ordeal. Four students who live in the area “affected by the incident” remain at the school at this stage, she said. We were just given instruction that we could start having students collected – the students that are the local ones, that live in the area affected by the incident, are still with us. The mayor of the Alpine Shire, Sarah Nicholas, has just released a video statement online. In it, she said: Today has been a day of deep sorrow and shock for our community. First and foremost, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues of the two police officers tragically killed in Porepunkah. Our thoughts, love, and unwavering support are with you during this incredibly painful time. We hold our police in the highest regard. They serve with courage, compassion, and dedication, and their loss is felt profoundly across our region. We are deeply grateful for their service and commitment. A visibly emotional Nicholas acknowledged it had been an “unsettling and emotional” day for the wider community. She continued: Thank you for your patience, your understanding, and for continuing to follow police instructions to stay safe. Your care for one another is what makes our Shire so strong. To our wonderful teachers: thank you for being a steady and calming presence for our children during today’s lockdowns. Your kindness and reassurance have made a world of difference in helping our young ones feel safe and supported. She said all council facilities would remain closed until further notice, and a council meeting planned for tonight was cancelled. We will keep our community informed as services resume. We are grieving together, and we will continue to support one another with compassion and care. Please stay safe. Caravan park near Porepunkah shooting site in ‘indefinite’ lockdown Emily White, a manager at Mount Buffalo caravan park, says the site is in lockdown. White, whose family also manages the nearby Riverview caravan park, said police had told everyone to remain at the site. We have been told we can’t go out. No one came come in. We don’t know how long. It’s indefinite right now. White said a nearby checkpoint, about 500m from the Mount Buffalo Caravan Park, could only be passed by police officers. Meanwhile, the ABC is reporting that parents are able to pick up their children from Porepunkah primary school, which had been in lockdown since this morning. Almost two dozen police cars at site of shooting as helicopter conducts search, airfield officer says Earlier, we reported that Porepunkah airfield was closed due to the emergency response. Its airfield active reporting officer, Mark Simpson, appeared on ABC Melbourne radio earlier to provide an update on the unfolding situation. He said from his location, at a roundabout near the incident site, en route to the airfield, he could see about 15 stationary police cars and seven or eight undercover police cars. The roundabout also leads into the nearby township of Mount Buffalo. A helicopter continued to search the area, Simpson said. He has been told to remain put. [The helicopter] has taken off from the airfield, been refuelled and is still searching for a person. One person treated for ‘serious lower body injuries’, Ambulance Victoria confirms. Ambulance Victoria has released a statement about its response to the Porepunkah shooting. A spokesperson confirmed paramedics were at the scene. Paramedics have treated one person for serious lower body injuries and transported [them] by air ambulance in a stable condition. Porepunkah airfield closed due to ‘emergency response’ The Porepunkah airfield has confirmed it has been closed due to the ongoing “emergency response”. Police and emergency services still have access. The airfield is situated two nautical miles south of the Porepunkah township, east of Mt. Buffalo national park. It is usually home to general and recreational aircraft, trikes, sailplanes, paramotors and radio-controlled models. Earlier, the airfield active reporting officer, Mark Simpson, told Guardian Australia he was stuck at the roundabout near the incident amid about 10 police vehicles, as the road heading south had been blocked off. Helicopter continuing to circle over Porepunkah, police reportedly on scene in camouflage gear ABC Goulburn Murray reporter Erin Somerville is speaking to ABC Melbourne radio to provide an update from the scene, which she says is “eerily still”. There are still dozens of police here at Porepunkah on a major tourist roundabout … We’ve recently, in the last hour, seen a very big, large, armoured police vehicle pass by, heading towards Mount Buffalo. We’ve also seen a number of police cars head down to a paddock towards the mountains. It’s very steep, very dense, very mountainous terrain … We still currently have a helicopter circling above a paddock just across the road from a very popular caravan park … into the foothills, which lead into Mount Buffalo … We also have a range of tactical support that have come in … We have what appear to be undercover police officers as well. We also saw one or two police officers who were wearing what looked like camouflage gear. Somerville said hikers had disappeared “for days” in the landscape, who had “wanted to be found”, so thick was the terrain. To recap, here’s what we know so far: The police were attending a rural property about 300km north-east of Melbourne on Tuesday to serve a warrant. Two officers have been killed and another wounded. Wangaratta police said there was still an “active incident” and have urged people to avoid the area. The local council closed all council facilities “effective immediately” and Porepunkah primary school remained in lockdown. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said the thoughts of “all Victorians” were with the police, saying the response showed first responders’ “extraordinary bravery and courage”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said his thoughts were with the “police for the work they do, each and every day”. He said “the men and women who wear the uniform of the police take risks” for everyone. The ABC has reported a strong police presence in the area, with about 50 officers in uniform and plainclothes in the vicinity. A police dog was also reportedly on site. Queensland premier sends ‘thoughts and prayers’ to Porepunkah Queensland’s premier, David Crisafulli, has sent “thoughts and prayers” to Victoria police after the confirmation of the deaths of two police officers. Posting to X, Crisafulli said: The thoughts and prayers of Queenslanders are with the Victorian Police family this afternoon. Police face dangers every day to keep us safe. This incident is another tragic reminder of that. The community of Porepunkah and all those impacted by this tragedy are in our hearts today. Victoria police has again confirmed that officers continue to respond to the incident, which remains active, and are asking people to avoid the area. What Porepunkah and the Alpine region are like At this time of year, Victoria’s High Country is usually home to keen holidaymakers visiting the region for official snow season in resort towns like Falls Creek, Mount Hotham and Dinner Plain. Bright, less than 10km from Porepunkah, is a regular stop for tourists, famous for its cycling routes, breweries and boutique stores. Despite its small size, Porepunkah also picks up its share of tourism, part of the Murray to Mountains rail trail and featuring a number of cellar doors, produce and picnic options, as well as providing an easy entry point to the ski town of Mount Buffalo. But it’s a different scene today, with dozens of officers amassing on the region from Wangaratta and Wodonga. The site of the incident is close to a number of caravan parks, motels and accommodation options, as well as the popular Porepunkah Pub. Students at Porepunkah Primary School being distracted with movies and coding, principal says Porepunkah Primary School is still in lockdown as the end of the school day approaches, its principal has confirmed. Speaking on ABC Melbourne radio, Jill Gillies said about 90 students were being distracted with movies, coding and touch typing. Teachers are absolute superstars and I have the best bunch of staff, they’ve had the kids in lockdown since around 11.30 this morning, they are masters at being able to be creative to find fun things to engage the kids and distract. Our teachers are amazing and the kids are super resilient. Gillies said the school was awaiting direction from the police over the length of the lockdown but children would be able to remain overnight if needed. We have food and access to toilets and comfort items … let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. We have to wait direction from the police, we’re really unsure at this stage. I just keep letting our parents know that we’re still in lockdown and I’ll keep them informed as we get closer to [the school day ending]. ‘We stand with you’: Victorian opposition leader pays tribute to emergency services The opposition leader, Brad Battin, has also made a statement to parliament. He says his thoughts are with all Victorian emergency services across the state: We know with an active situation up there, it’s not just the emergency services, it’s the local community that is impacted. We hear of lockdowns in schools. We send out our thoughts to the families, the parents and everyone involved with those schools as well … We hope there is a quick resolution and more information comes out as soon as possible, but to every single Victoria police officer today, we stand with you, we stand beside you and we’ll continue to. Victoria’s premier, Jacinta Allan, is beginning parliament’s question time with a brief statement on the Porepunkah shooting. She says: A police operation is currently under way in Porepunkah in Victoria’s north-east. The police minister and I have been briefed by the chief commissioner of the Victoria police and this situation remains active. Victoria police officers and all of our first responders show extraordinary bravery and courage every single day. They are the best of us. I do ask the Victorian community, particularly those in that beautiful part of the north-east of our state, to follow the advice of Victoria police. More information will be provided by Victoria police to the Victorian community as it becomes available. It’s worth noting Allan has changed into a black suit – she was previously dressed in red at a press conference this morning. Australian Federal Police Association stands ready to support Victorian officers The Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA) has separately confirmed that one officer has been wounded and two others are believed, but not confirmed, to be deceased after police executed a warrant at a rural property in Porepunkah.

Its president, Alex Caruana, said the association and its 4,000-plus members stood in solidarity with its Victorian counterparts.

A dog from a police squad was also released into a nearby paddock. Media have been directed to a cordoned off area as the situation continues to unfold, the reporter said: When I did speak to police earlier, they did indicate that the heavy police presence had come from across the region, as you can imagine, to help out with this unfolding incident. We’re still seeing police cars coming in from the direction of Wodonga and Wangaratta as I’m speaking to you. I followed police cars the whole way from Wodonga.

We thank you for your patience and understanding. We’ll update the community when our services resume. Circling back to the press conference, the Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said there were “grave concerns” for some of the police officers involved in the incident. Just from the police blue family, the wider family across Australia and overseas, our thoughts and prayers are with Victoria police right now.
