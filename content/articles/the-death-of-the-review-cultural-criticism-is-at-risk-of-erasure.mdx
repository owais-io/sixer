  Media layoffs are no longer breaking news; at this point, it’s more of a
  weekly check-in to determine which publications are shaving a few more jobs,
  firing people en masse, or shuttering altogether. But for the admittedly niche
  demographic that follows the ups and downs of professional film and culture
  criticism, it’s been a particularly rough couple of weeks, in part because the
  job losses feel so specifically targeted. The Chicago Tribune isn’t just
  undergoing a round of layoffs to weather some bad economic news; they’re
  eliminating the position of film critic entirely, and with it mainstay Michael
  Phillips, who inherited a beat once occupied by Gene Siskel. Phillips kept the
  Siskel torch burning in more ways than one; after Ebert retired from regular
  on-camera reviews, Phillips co-hosted a Siskel &amp; Ebert offshoot with AO
  Scott, who has since also left the film-crit world, albeit voluntarily. But
  over at the New York Times, where Scott still works at the Book Review, four
  culture critics have recently been reassigned, essentially stripped of their
  original titles before being eventually replaced by … well, let’s have culture
  editor Sia Michel try to explain it: “Our readers are hungry for trusted
  guides to help them make sense of this complicated landscape, not only through
  traditional reviews but also with essays, new story forms, videos and
  experimentation with other platforms.” Translation: critics better learn to
  TikTok. And they better not expect to write so many of their dumb reviews.
  Even more galling was Vanity Fair’s announcement of a refocusing on core
  coverage areas such as Hollywood, which would somehow actually necessitate
  firing their film critic Richard Lawson (as well as several journalists
  covering the exact areas the magazine is supposedly building up). Arts
  criticism has been vanishingly difficult to break into for ages, no one’s idea
  of a growth industry. But publications have managed to make a dire situation
  worse; it’s now reached the point where long-tenured veterans are having their
  jobs erased in a misguided rethinking of what criticism even actually is.
  Obviously, the job prospects of an aspiring film critic don’t exactly affect
  thousands of workers. At the same time, it’s not as if there isn’t an interest
  in criticism and criticism-adjacent, ah, “content”. There’s apparently still
  money to be made in covering the arts, especially a mass-appeal medium like
  the movies; Rotten Tomatoes wouldn’t do occasional dramatic tally reveals if
  critical reception was a nonstarter in terms of online eyeballs. Publications
  still send staffers and freelancers to screenings, and studios still hold them
  regularly. Whether the people attending these screenings are actual critics,
  though, is a little more water-y; studios have a growing preference towards
  influencers who are more likely to raise awareness about a movie and post
  cheerfully about the great time they had rather than digging into the
  specifics and nuance of a particular work. That more complex process doesn’t
  always mean filing negative reviews, either; a good critic can be far more
  illuminating about a work’s goodness or greatness than amateurish attempts at
  half-solicited ad copy. That’s why the Times editorial missive feels so
  menacing; rather than defending the work of its experienced and professional
  critics, it has big if-you-can’t-beat-em-join-em vibes. Yet despite those bad
  vibes, in some ways the last decade represents a golden age of film criticism.
  For much of the back half of the 20th century, mainstream film criticism was
  practiced by newspaper writers – often male, usually white, not infrequently
  middle-aged or older. This lent the work the consistency of a seasoned pro, as
  well as a certain daily-grind uniformity among the rank-and-file. Of course,
  there has always been higher-level or longer-form work in journals and
  magazines, as well as superior newspaper critics. Roger Ebert could turn a
  600-word review into a concise and revealing piece of art. But the internet
  has allowed a greater diversity of tastes, ages, races, genders and formats in
  the field over the past few decades. Often this work transcends the
  new-release grind. Letterboxd, the popular social media app, allows readers to
  sort through countless opinions on almost any movie (or just find some
  concisely silly jokes reminiscent of Classic Twitter). Even clickbaity
  anniversary pieces mean that (some) older movies get much more mainstream
  critical attention than in the past (though you might have to stomach weaker
  writers and editors describing virtually anything as a “cult classic”). From
  the pithy one-liners to the 4,000-word essays, some of this stuff is bad. Some
  of it is great. Such is the way of all writing. In terms of sheer volume,
  though, there is a staggering amount of analysis available on movies,
  television and so on. (I know this firsthand, because sometimes it seems like
  I’m writing a bunch of it myself.) What so much of it has in common is that it
  pays little to nothing. The idea of making an actual living as a critic is
  increasingly remote – something I realize I am incalculably lucky to be able
  to do, and in constant danger of no longer actually doing. When low-context
  influencers who have never seen a movie made before they were born become a
  professional priority, genuine film criticism threatens to become a hobbyist’s
  favorite esoteric pastime. Plenty of folks would react with: so what? Why do
  we need critics telling us what to think, anyway? The truth is, you don’t.
  Most critics aren’t trying to tell you what to think. Some of us aren’t even
  trying to convince you not to see the new Marvel movie you’re sure you’ll
  enjoy as much as any perpetually enthused influencer. (No one knows your
  tastes better than you. Also, going to the movies is fun. I understand why the
  influencers like it so much. Brutal reviews rarely dissuade me from seeing a
  movie I want to see.) But if you’re interested in reading about movies (or TV,
  or music, or video games), you will benefit from writers whose knowledge of
  the medium extends beyond the past five years of free screenings. In other
  words, what anyone would expect from reading the Chicago Tribune, the New York
  Times or Vanity Fair: someone who might know more about the situation than you
  do. Not definitively, and certainly not about what you personally like, but
  someone in a long-term relationship with the movies, with all the ups, downs
  and hang-ups that entails. Criticism isn’t exactly journalism; at its best,
  it’s more like a conversation between writer, reader and subject. This doesn’t
  have to be the dreaded gatekeeping – or maybe it can be a different form of
  it, guiding people who show up at the gate without a map rather than barring
  anyone from entry. Publications desperate to avoid gatekeeping will
  increasingly find themselves in the embarrassing situation of attempting to
  court and exploit influencers – a class of not-quite-professionals whose whole
  deal is squeezing whatever branding and money they can from themselves. Why
  would any influencer in their right mind want to revenue-share with Vanity
  Fair or make #content for the New York Times? These publications obviously
  aren’t quite ready to give up on the written word; they just see criticism as
  a particularly optional offshoot of it. The professional outlook for arts
  critics won’t improve without a whole lot of media-industry upturns, so
  advocating for critics in particular might seem self-serving. Learn to code,
  learn to TikTok, learn to influence; learn to do something else. That may be
  what all of us wind up doing. In the meantime, critics can only hope for a
  growing realization among readers, viewers and decision-makers: if you enjoy
  reading or talking about movies, you might like criticism more than you think.
