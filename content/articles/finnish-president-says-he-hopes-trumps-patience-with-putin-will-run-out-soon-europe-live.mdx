  Residents queueing up with bottles at tanker trucks petition Putin for help;
  Polish president vetoes support for Ukrainian children. What we know on day
  1,280 of the war. You can read our daily briefing here: Finnish president
  Alexander Stubb has been speaking at a press conference before the country’s
  ambassadors’ conference in Helsinki. In comments reported by the Finnish
  public broadcaster, Yle, he said that he hoped Trump’s patience with Putin
  would run out soon. He insisted that Finland and other European countries
  “will do everything we can do achieve lasting peace.” He also hinted that the
  only way to force Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine would be by hitting his
  allies, qupping “the only ones who can persuade Putin to make peace are more
  in the east than in the west.” In further comments reported by Ilta-Sanomat,
  he added that the current discussions were focusing on the extent of security
  guarantees that would be offered to Ukraine. Stubb also said he warned Trump
  that Putin was deploying a “typical” Russian delaying tactic to avoid meeting
  Zelenskyy. US president Donald Trump warned last night that there could be
  “consequences” if Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy do not meet. Who would face these consequences and what
  they could possibly entail is not exactly clear. Despite much speculation
  about the timing and the potential location for the Putin-Zelenskyy meeting,
  we do not appear to be any closer to it actually happening as Russian attacks
  on Ukraine continue. Asked why Putin didn’t want to meet with Zelenskyy, he
  offered this explanation: “Because he doesn’t like him.” Trump revealed that
  he had talked to Putin since his last week’s meeting with European leaders
  again. Asked how the conversation talks went, Trump said: “Every conversation
  I have with him is a good conversation. And then, unfortunately, a bomb is
  loaded up into Kyiv or someplace, and I get very angry about it.” On a more
  technical level, US state secretary Marco Rubio spoke with his European
  counterparts last night, discussing potential security guarantees for the
  wartorn country should the meeting go ahead and the two leaders somehow
  managed to find a way to agree a peace deal. Once again, we are yet to see
  what emerges from these talks. Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha
  praised the US leadership on this issue, but “reiterated … that security
  guarantees must be concrete, legally binding, and effective.” But Poland’s
  foreign minister Radosław Sikorski warned the leaders that “the Kremlin has
  not abandoned its maximalist aims from the beginning of the war,” and insisted
  that the only way to get Moscow round to the negotiating table is through
  further political, economic and military pressure on its interests. Let’s see
  what today brings us on these two issues. Separately, I will also keep an eye
  on the latest in France as the country’s embattled prime minister looks likely
  to be ousted and his government toppled next month in a high-stakes confidence
  vote that could plunge the EU’s second-biggest economy into even deeper
  political crisis. We should also get some new language on the EU-US trade
  arrangements, with Trump threatening overnight to impose tariffs and exports
  bans on countries with taxes and laws deemed to be discriminating against US
  tech companies. His longstanding criticism of the EU’s rulebook is well known,
  so this latest warning will probably draw another deep sigh from EU officials.
  I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Tuesday, 26 August 2025, it’s
  Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
