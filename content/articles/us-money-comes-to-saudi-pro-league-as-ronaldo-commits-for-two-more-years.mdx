  The Saudi Pro League season kicks off on Thursday, just before the
  international break, when Cristiano Ronaldo will probably make headlines by
  saying the Saudi Pro League is one of the top five in the world. If so, the
  40-year-old is bound to reference Al-Hilal reaching the quarter-finals of the
  Club World Cup, drawing with Real Madrid then beating Manchester City 4-3.
  There is now something else, though, that the league has in common with its
  European counterparts – US money. In July the ministry of sports announced
  that three clubs had passed into private hands. Al-Kholood, the only one in
  the top tier, have been taken over by an American investment company, the
  Harburg Group, run by the venture capital investor Ben Harburg. “The first
  three Saudi sports clubs have been privatised through a public offering – Al
  Ansar, Al Kholood, and Al Zulfi – with their ownership transferred to
  investment entities,” the ministry said It is part of a strategy from the
  league to bring in foreign money. Building the brand of Al-Kholood is not
  going to be easy: the club have spent much of their history outside the top
  tier and are based not in Riyadh or the Red Sea port of Jeddah but Ar Rass, a
  city of 120,000 people about 250 miles north-west of the capital. But there is
  something to work with. Al-Kholood were promoted in 2024 and finished ninth
  last season, helped by 15 goals from the Comoros international Myziane Maolida
  and a defence including the Nigerian centre-back William Troost-Ekong. The new
  owners have brought in the English manager Des Buckingham. The 40-year-old won
  the Indian Super League with Mumbai City, part of the City Football Group, and
  secured promotion with Oxford United to the Championship in 2024 before he was
  fired in December, harshly some thought, after poor results. If England’s
  second tier is regarded as the most competitive and open of leagues, the SPL
  is not bad either in terms of potential winners, with a big four or even five
  in contention. In the summer of 2023, Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli from Jeddah and
  their Riyadh rivals Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr were taken over by the Public
  Investment Fund and then the oil company Aramco got involved with Al-Qadsiah.
  Those were the top five last season. Al-Ittihad were champions. The Tigers
  deserved the title, helped by the goals of Karim Benzema, assists from Moussa
  Diaby and the midfield brilliance of N’Golo Kanté. Laurent Blanc has kept the
  team together. Al-Hilal finished second after losing their way in the latter
  half of the season. That cost Jorge Jesus his job as head coach and in came
  Simone Inzaghi. The Italian impressed at the Club World Cup and adding Darwin
  Núñez to the attack means that the 19-times champions, who tend to bounce back
  after disappointment, are the team to beat, even if their best player last
  season, Salem Al-Dawsari, is 34. Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr were next, helped by a
  late decision that handed them three points and third place (and entry into
  Asian club competition) after losing to opponents who were found to have
  fielded an ineligible player. Stefano Pioli arrived from Italy a month after
  the start of last season but the Italian coach never looked settled as the
  Yellows relied on moments of brilliance from their star men. It was no
  surprise that he left over the summer. In a move akin to Mikel Arteta leaving
  Arsenal in May and turning up at Tottenham in July, Jesus has returned to
  Riyadh. The veteran Portuguese manager can call on Ronaldo after his
  compatriot signed a new contract for two more years. Jhon Durán has gone, and
  in come Kingsley Coman from Bayern Munich and João Félix, who opened his
  account in the Super Cup thanks to an assist from Ronaldo. The five-time
  Ballon d’Or winner is 61 short of 1,000 goals (and the only player to reach a
  century for four clubs) and wouldn’t mind lifting a first major trophy in
  Saudi Arabia as he approaches his three-year anniversary there. Having Jesus,
  who led Al-Hilal to a dominant title in 2024 and setting a world record
  winning streak of 34 games on the way, could make the difference. Al-Ahli
  finished fifth but more than made up for a relatively disappointing domestic
  campaign by winning the Asian Champions League for the first time in May. Ivan
  Toney, after taking time to settle, was soon forging an understanding with
  Riyad Mahrez and ended up as the second-top scorer with 23, two more than
  Benzema and two behind Ronaldo. Al-Qadsiah were fourth in their first season
  after promotion and would have been third but for Al-Nassr’s late three-point
  handout. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left for Marseille but has been
  replaced by the Italian striker Mateo Retegui, signed from Atalanta for almost
  £60m. Of the others, there will be attention on Neom SC, a promoted club who
  represent a city yet to be built. The former Paris Saint-Germain manager
  Christophe Galtier is in charge with funds at his disposal. Even so, the big
  five are unlikely to become the big six just yet.
