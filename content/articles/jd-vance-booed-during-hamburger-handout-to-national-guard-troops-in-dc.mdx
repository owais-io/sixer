  JD Vance was booed and heckled with chants of “Free DC!” during a photo op
  with national guard troops at Union Station in Washington on Wednesday
  afternoon. Handing out burgers to troops deployed last week by Donald Trump,
  at the station’s Shake Shack alongside the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
  and White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, Vance told soldiers “we
  appreciate everything you’re doing” and asserted: “We brought some law and
  order back.” Meanwhile, a crowd of demonstrators protested outside. The crowd
  shouted slogans such as “Free DC!” and “From DC to Palestine, occupation is a
  crime.” Some also shouted expletives as the three men walked into Union
  Station and gathered at the restaurant, and continued as they tried to speak
  to reporters and eventually left. Asked why the troops were at the station
  instead of parts of the city where crime rates were statistically higher,
  Vance claimed it was being overrun with “vagrants, drug addicts, the
  chronically homeless and the mentally ill” and that visitors didn’t feel safe.
  “This should be a monument to American greatness,” he said, later adding: “We
  do not have to live like this.” Addressing the protests, Vance said: “It’s
  kind of bizarre that we have a bunch of old, primarily white people who are
  out there protesting the policies that keep people safe when they’ve never
  felt danger in their entire lives.” Appropriating the protesters’ chants, he
  added: “Let’s free Washington DC, so that young families can walk around and
  feel safe and secure. That’s what we’re trying to free DC from.” His
  sentiments were echoed by Miller, who belittled those who had gathered in
  protest as “crazy communists”. “We’re going to ignore these stupid white
  hippies that all need to go home and take a nap because they’re all over 90
  years old, and we’re going to get back to the business of protecting the
  American people and the citizens of Washington DC,” he said. Last week, the
  president federalized the city’s Metropolitan police department and directed
  Hegseth to mobilize national guard troops, claiming he was cracking down on
  “crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor” in the nation’s “lawless” capital,
  despite a sharply falling crime rate with violent crime at a 30-year low. An
  estimated 1,900 troops are being deployed in DC. More than half are coming
  from Republican-led states including Louisiana and South Carolina. Besides
  Union Station, troops have mostly been spotted in downtown areas, including
  the National Mall and metro stops.
