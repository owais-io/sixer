  Russia’s reaction to Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has
  been nothing short of jubilant, with Moscow celebrating the fact that the
  Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions and now faces
  no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s ceasefire demands. “The meeting proved
  that negotiations are possible without preconditions,” wrote the former
  president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram. He added that the summit showed that
  talks could continue as Russia wages war in Ukraine. Trump entered the
  high-stakes summit warning “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some form
  of a ceasefire,” and threatening “severe consequences” if Moscow refused to
  cooperate. But after a three-hour meeting with the Russian side that yielded
  no tangible results, Trump shelved his threats and instead said the meeting
  was “extremely productive”, even as Putin clung to his maximalist demands for
  ending the war and announced no concessions on the battlefield, where Russian
  forces are consolidating key gains in eastern Ukraine. Putin on Friday
  demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk as a condition for ending
  the war, but offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline, two sources
  with direct knowledge of the talks said. Although Luhansk is almost entirely
  under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key parts of Donetsk, including the
  cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk and heavily fortified positions whose
  defence has cost tens of thousands of lives. Putin told Trump that in exchange
  for Donetsk and Luhansk, he would halt further advances and freeze the
  frontline in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where
  Russian forces occupy significant areas. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, has consistently rejected giving up territory and on Saturday
  European allies reaffirmed that Ukraine’s borders must not be altered through
  force. On Saturday morning, Trump also publicly dropped plans for an immediate
  ceasefire he had himself championed for months, instead embracing Putin’s
  preferred path to ending the war: pushing through a far-reaching agreement
  before halting any fighting. “It was determined by all that the best way to
  end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace
  Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which
  often times do not hold up,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth
  Social. All in all, the view from Moscow is that Putin appears to have gained
  the upper hand. “Putin gave Trump nothing, but still got everything he wanted.
  Trump finally listened to his demands,” said a member of the Russian foreign
  policy establishment, speaking on condition of anonymity. In his remarks after
  the meeting in Alaska, Putin gave little indication of softening his stance,
  repeating that Moscow wanted the “root causes” of the conflict addressed –
  Kremlin shorthand for demands to demilitarise Ukraine, restrict its domestic
  politics and block its path to Nato. No economic incentives offered by Trump’s
  team seemed to sway Putin – the economic delegations meeting was even scrapped
  – with observers stressing he would always prioritise the war in Ukraine over
  whatever financial gains peace might unlock. Trump admitted there were still
  “one or two pretty significant items” left to resolve with Putin, but most
  worryingly for Kyiv, he ramped up pressure on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling Fox
  News host Sean Hannity: “Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it
  done.” These comments were quickly seized upon in Moscow. “Both sides directly
  placed responsibility for achieving future results in negotiations on ending
  military actions on Kyiv and Europe,” Medvedev, now the deputy chair of
  Russia’s security council, wrote. Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the
  Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said: “Trump now appears to be shifting much
  of the responsibility on to Kyiv and Europe. Ukraine is likely to face
  increased pressure from the US to begin substantive discussions of Putin’s
  conditions.” She added that Trump was “once again clearly charmed and
  impressed by his interlocutor”, referring to the warm body language and
  effusive compliments the US president directed at Putin. The key question is
  how far Trump will press Zelenskyy, who is due to meet him in Washington on
  Monday, to accept a deal on Putin’s terms and whether European allies can once
  again steer Trump on to a different course. “Trump clearly did not fully
  accept the settlement plan that Putin is promoting,” cautioned Stanovaya. For
  now, though, confidence runs high in Moscow. “The tasks of the special
  military operation will be accomplished either by military or diplomatic
  means,” wrote a senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Klishas, on Telegram.
  Officials close to Putin felt free to contradict Trump outright. Yuri Ushakov,
  a Kremlin aide who attended the Alaska meeting, said no talks had taken place
  about a three-way summit between Putin, Zelenskyy and Trump, directly
  rebutting Trump’s claim to reporters that a meeting was in the works. Russian
  state media and the Kremlin elite were already in high spirits as Trump rolled
  out the red carpet and treated Putin as an equal, despite the Russian leader
  being wanted by The Hague court for war crimes. “Western media are on the
  verge of completely losing it,” wrote the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria
  Zakharova, as Putin landed in Alaska. “For three years they told everyone
  Russia was isolated and today they saw a beautiful red carpet laid out for the
  Russian president in the US,” she added. On Saturday morning, Russia’s Channel
  One morning news bulletin highlighted the pomp of the summit, its
  international visibility, and the warm welcome for Putin, a striking contrast
  to his isolation by western leaders since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. “The
  red carpet and handshakes … are in all global publications and TV channels,” a
  presenter cheered, noting it was the first time Trump had met a visiting
  leader at the airport.
