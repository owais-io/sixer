  The Crystal Palace chairman, Steve Parish, has confirmed that Eberechi Eze is
  to complete his move to Arsenal but has been urged to find replacements by his
  clearly frustrated manager, Oliver Glasner. Palace will head to Norway for the
  second leg of their Conference League playoff against Fredrikstad on an
  artificial surface with a 1-0 lead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta’s header.
  But with Eze having pulled out on the morning of the game citing illness after
  Arsenal agreed a fee worth up to £67.5m for the England forward on Wednesday
  evening, they struggled to break their opponents down and Parish acknowledged
  that it is imperative Palace are decisive in the transfer market. “He’s been
  fantastic for the club,” he said of Eze on Channel 5. “We all love him for
  what he’s done and what he’s achieved and we’re pleased that he’s going to go
  on and fulfil the other ambitions that he’s got. But the king is no longer the
  king, right? We have to move past it and we have to find other players to
  bring in that could support the rest of the team and Oliver.” Parish also
  admitted that Marc Guéhi could still epart Palace with Liverpool interested in
  signing the Palace captain, who has entered the final year of his contract.
  “If Marc wants to sign a contract, then he can stay. If he doesn’t want to
  sign a contract, then we have to look at it,” he said. “It’s a difficult
  situation. Every club like us, and particularly if you’re in Europe, the
  financial rules are a lot tighter than the Premier League. They’re a lot
  tighter. Everybody has to sell players to, you know, comply with the rules. So
  that’s a situation we’ll have to look at in the next 11 days.” But Glasner was
  only half-joking when he suggested that Guéhi’s departure before next week’s
  second leg would force the former defender into considering playing himself.
  “I just know if Marc leaves, and is not available for Fredrikstad, we would
  have big problems,” he said. “It’s pretty clear. We can’t register anyone. So
  from my side, he has to stay. You see, we played with Jefferson Lerma in the
  back today. He’s a midfield player. We have no centre-backs available at the
  moment, and if Marc leaves, OK, maybe I will ry my boots, because I was a
  centre-back and this could be a good option. I will think about it.” Palace
  have spent the least amount of any club in Europe’s top five leagues and have
  earmarked Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss as a potential replacement for Eze.
  Asked whether he felt disheartened by the situation after leading Palace to
  the FA Cup glory in May, Glasner added: “I think it’s better I don’t talk too
  much about it. Because, you know, I start to get … And it’s better than not
  always saying what you are feeling and what you’re thinking. We have to act.
  We need this. And this is Crystal Palace’s future. The profile is defined for
  months. It is not surprising for everyone that Ebs left. We missed the chance
  to replace him early enough. That’s completely our fault and nobody else’s.”
