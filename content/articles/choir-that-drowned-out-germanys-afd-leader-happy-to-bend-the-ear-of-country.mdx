  It was while Alice Weidel was being interviewed on the terrace of a parliament
  building overlooking the River Spree in Berlin that members of the Corner
  Chor’s mobile phones began to ping with alerts as their song in protest at her
  far-right party, Scheiß AfD Jodler (Shit AfD Yodellers), blasted out from a
  100,000-watt sound system on the other bank. “We were hugely surprised and
  truly happy to hear at that moment that our song was receiving such a public
  airing,” one choir member told the Guardian. The choir had not known of the
  carefully orchestrated plans by the Centre for Political Beauty (ZPS) – an
  association of action artists led by the philosopher Philipp Ruch – to use
  their song to disrupt the so-called summer interview, a regular annual TV
  fixture in which leaders of the main political parties are questioned in turn,
  typically in a relaxed setting. Neither had the authorities, nor the public
  broadcaster ARD. And disrupt it certainly did. The sweet-sounding 19th-century
  Styrian Christmas yodel, which Corner Chor had rewritten as a three-voice
  protest song against the far right, managed to drown out much of the hour-long
  exchange, prompting Weidel to lean into the interviewer Markus Preiß and tell
  him: “I have problems understanding you against this noise.” She insisted on
  continuing with the interview, however, at the same time as accusing the choir
  of being state-funded, an erroneous slur increasingly used by the party to
  attack its opponents. The party’s leaders later said they had been victimised
  and insisted on a rerun, which the broadcaster has so far refused to
  entertain. Ruch called the action less of a disruption and “more of an
  embellishment”. The state had classified the AfD as rightwing extremists
  earlier this year, he said in an interview. He added “‘[ARD] should have
  figured out for themselves that this in itself was an indecent idea.” Corner
  Chor, from the southern city of Augsburg, has been quietly making a name for
  itself as an activist choir, part of a growing trend in Germany. Established
  six years ago as a musical education project, it appears everywhere from
  street corners to festivals, performing its songs and mantras in myriad
  settings from river swims to squats, to underground passageways. Its topics,
  alongside anti-fascist activities, include campaigning for free sanitary
  products or against extortionate rents and the gender pay gap. It is a
  15-strong collective of self-described feminist Flinta-friendly singers (a
  German acronym standing for women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans and
  agender people). The singers emphasise they are not just interested in
  political protest, also singing everything “from sea shanties to Mozart”.
  However, the broadcast of their yodel has taken the collective into a new
  realm as well as heightening their sense of social responsibility, four
  members told the Guardian in a recent interview over Zoom, for which they did
  not want to be individually identified, citing their wish to be viewed as a
  collective voice, as well as fears for their safety. “We simply wanted to
  expose the AfD’s content in a non-aggressive way, through this very
  uncomplicated, mantra-like song, which has something very contemplative about
  it because it’s usually sung at Christmas and allows us to express exactly
  what we wanted to say, as clearly as possible,” a second singer said. The song
  was inspired by a notorious 2023 meeting of neo-Nazis and other extremists
  that party members had taken part in, where the mass deportation of foreigners
  was a central topic, and which sparked a wave of nationwide protest. The
  singers, who come from all walks of life, admitted to being a little shocked
  by the resonance their song had enjoyed since going viral at the Weidel
  broadcast, having reached No 6 in the iTunes Germany charts. It received
  60,000 plays on Spotify, drew thousands of new followers on their Instagram
  account and an innumerable number of downloads from SoundCloud of a Scheiß AfD
  ringtone. The choir has also attracted donations for forthcoming projects. The
  song has already been widely remixed by other musicians, picked up by choirs
  around the country and become a regular feature at demonstrations, including
  recent Pride marches, with many citing the “earworm” quality of what the
  Corner Chor describes as “15 seconds of music against rightwing extremism”.
  Yet the reception has not been entirely positive. The choir, which describes
  itself and its weekly rehearsals as a “safe space”, has received threats and
  offensive posts on social media. Its critics have accused it of trying to
  silence the fifth of German voters who support the AfD, the largest opposition
  party in the Bundestag. “We must ask ourselves: who exactly are we giving a
  platform to? And how loud are they allowed to be?” a third member said.
  “Attempts to label us as a bunch of hysterical women are ill advised. We are
  humorously disruptive, peaceful protesters … We had not intended to bend the
  ear of the whole country but we’re happy we’ve done so. People are speaking
  about this way beyond the event itself, about the AfD.”
