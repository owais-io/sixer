  Keith Andrews has revealed Yoane Wissa will not take part in Brentford’s
  opening game against Nottingham Forest on Sunday amid strong interest from
  Newcastle. The forward from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is understood
  to have been training on his own this week as Andrews prepares to take charge
  of his first match since succeeding Thomas Frank. Brentford are holding out
  for about £40m and Newcastle have proved unwilling to match their valuation
  for the 28-year-old, who scored 19 times in the Premier League last season,
  having had an offer worth up to £30m rejected last month. Wissa has made no
  secret of his desire to leave after a bid from Forest was rejected by
  Brentford in January and Andrews said he had decided not to involve him. “It
  has been a very disrupted pre-season – you’re aware of that interest in Yoane.
  “I’m very clear on the situation. As a head coach, I want Yoane in the
  building, to be a part of the first team and the squad. I see that moving
  forwards, but I am very understanding of his situation. “I have a very good
  relationship with him, and that will persist, but we have to focus on the
  players who are ready to play and perform and I don’t think Yoane’s in that
  space.” Brentford, who are interested in signing Dango Ouattara, but must wait
  until Bournemouth have secured a replacement, have sold last season’s top
  scorer, Bryan Mbeumo, to Manchester United, the captain, Christian Nørgaard,
  to Arsenal and the goalkeeper Mark Flekken to Bayer Leverkusen. Andrews would
  not confirm whether Jordan Henderson would be available to make his debut
  against Forest, but denied that so many departures could unsettle the squad.
  He said: “The only one that really disrupts an ideal preparation is the Yoane
  Wissa situation. It’s something that hasn’t affected the players. Would they
  like him to be part of the squad? Of course they would.”
