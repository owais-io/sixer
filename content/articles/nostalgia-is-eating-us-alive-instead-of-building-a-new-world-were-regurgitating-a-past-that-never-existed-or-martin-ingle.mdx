  There has been much talk about our hunger for a “return to optimism”. Our
  world has been too real for too long, and we all just want a bit of shelter
  from the storm. We look back in patronising nostalgia at Obama’s Hope poster
  in the same way we insist music hasn’t been real music since about 1986 (or
  since 1966, or since the Great American Songbook, or since Mozart, depending
  who you talk to). Movie theatres are propped up by two monolith tent poles:
  DC’s umpteenth Superman and Marvel’s Fantastic Four reboot, both attempting a
  full factory reset of their flagship properties. It offers a return to the
  originals – AKA, the “good old days”. But this isn’t so much a yearning for a
  new optimism as it is a resuscitation of an old one. The Fantastic Four is
  even set in a 1960s Jetsons-style alternate reality (the first comic was
  published in 1961). Remember this? This is Things As They Should Be™. The
  great irony in this regurgitation of old aesthetics is that, they themselves
  looked forward. The joy and optimism of the space age showcased the marvellous
  and fantastic possibilities of technology and science, before we knew that
  those same industries would slowly start choking our own atmosphere. We want
  to go back to that time, when we could feel good about driving our big shiny
  bubble cars and tease our hair up guilt-free – without thinking about the
  ozone or whatever. This perceived collective optimism was never real, of
  course. But now, after decades of doom storytelling and hope erosion, we want
  the dream back. What’s happening in the culture is more than the good honest
  fun of theme park recreations, 1950s diners and old west camera filters. This
  is an earnest but somehow deeply sad defibrillation of dead worlds, built
  around a hollow craving that can never ever be filled. We are birds constantly
  regurgitating and eating our own upchuck. Same flavour but different colour,
  different flavour but same chunks. Its passion looks inspirational, but its
  sniff is grief. It works, but not quite — as fresh as microwaved leftovers.
  It’s the cultural equivalent of Maga – the lie that there was some glorious
  past where things were flourishing and wholesome and if we can just get back
  there we’ll be on track again. But there never was that past. It’s a
  distortion of immature childhood memories and historical rewriting by big
  corporations. This is the multiverse made real by an increasingly small cabal
  of conglomerates leveraging their various assets, stuffing each storytelling
  turducken full of old money-makers to reduce the risk in anything new. It’s
  not so much the multiverse as the IP-verse. Every brand everywhere all at
  once. Over time this starts to feel like a photocopy of a photocopy. The AI
  boom is quite literally sampling and recycling things that already exist. When
  I see a brand-new building proudly inspired by the art deco movement of 100
  years ago, I wonder if the great deco designers knew way back then that they
  were on the blind precipice of the future, or were they recreating their own
  nostalgic past? I wonder, as typography and graphic design trends cycle
  through recreations of past “vintage” ideas, what the concept of “vintage”
  meant to people back when it was, to them, modern? Having lost hope for the
  future, we have always looked back for comfort. We have to be cautious of the
  reasons why. Why did Nazi aesthetics have such a fetish for ancient Rome? Why
  did Soviet culture idolise modern industrial style? Even in The Handmaid’s
  Tale’s Gilead, they revere the natural and organic by insisting on non-GM and
  high-fat foods. The world around us tells us a lot about our beliefs. We are
  all potential victims of this ideological myth-making. It’s invisible but
  everywhere, and it’s difficult to tell if people in power aim to manufacture a
  world that matches their values or if it’s some kind of naturally developing,
  laissez-faire attraction. We’re all dreaming of a better time from the past,
  since there is no future. We’ve stopped dreaming about building – now we dream
  of recreating. It’s not recreating the actual thing that we want, it’s the
  yearning to recreate the feeling we had back then. In my local city centre, I
  drive past heritage-protected sandstone buildings with the names of the
  original shopfronts still carved at the top. The mason etching that date in
  the rock was doing it for the future, so as time stretched on his mark would
  stay there, even for me now as I whip past the exact same building in a space
  shuttle machine he could never even dream of. Imagine a shop front named
  something like, “Nolan and Sons Merchants, est. 1861.” And on the shop front
  awning below it, computer-printed on laminate in an deliberately old-timey
  font, “Buzz’d Cafe, est. 2025.” Take a sledgehammer to the wall of this cafe.
  Pierce the membrane of lino wallpaper printed to look like rustic bricks and
  find sterile chalk-white plasterboard from the previous shop, which was itself
  once added to modernise and cover the rustic brick walls beneath. You can find
  these rings of a tree in everything: generations on top of generations of us
  each trying to make our own existence matter and either cover or recover the
  ones before us. So, do we seek comfort in the baby blanket of our past myths –
  or do we try to create our own new ones? • Martin Ingle is a writer and
