  An overwhelming majority of members of the world’s leading genocide scholars’
  association have backed a resolution stating that Israel’s actions in Gaza
  meet the legal definition of the crime. Eighty-six per cent of those who voted
  in the 500-member International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS)
  supported the motion. The resolution states that “Israel’s policies and
  actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide in article II of the
  United Nations convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of
  genocide (1948).” The three-page resolution passed by the body calls on Israel
  to “immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes
  against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks
  against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation
  of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of
  the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of
  the population.” The resolution said the IAGS recognised that “since the
  horrific Hamas-led attack of 7 October 2023, which itself constitutes
  international crimes”, the government of Israel had engaged in systematic and
  widespread crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, including
  indiscriminate and deliberate attacks against the civilians and civilian
  infrastructure, including hospitals, homes and commercial buildings, of Gaza.
  Melanie O’Brien, the IAGS president and a professor of international law at
  the University of Western Australia, said the resolution was “a definitive
  statement from experts in the field of genocide studies that what is going on
  on the ground in Gaza is genocide”. Founded in 1994, the IAGS has a broad
  membership that includes academics, historians, political scientists and human
  rights activists. It has adopted previous resolutions identifying genocide,
  including historical cases such as the Armenian genocide. The 1948 UN
  convention, drafted in the aftermath of the Holocaust, defines genocide as
  acts committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
  ethnical, racial or religious group”. It obliges signatory states to act to
  prevent and stop such crimes, which may include killing members of a group,
  inflicting serious harm, imposing destructive living conditions, preventing
  births or transferring children by force. There was no immediate response from
  the Israeli foreign ministry. Israel is fighting allegations at the world’s
  top court, the international court of justice, of committing genocide in Gaza.
  Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants
  for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence
  minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military
  chief Mohammed Deif, but withdrew it after he was killed. Reuters contributed
