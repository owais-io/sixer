  The far right’s green bashing has given mainstream parties an excuse to do

  Last year, I stood in front of a black-clad skinhead as he shook a fist full
  of rings thick enough to double as a knuckle-duster. Flecks of spit flew into
  my face as he railed against the green agenda of the last German government.
  Until recently, it would have felt bizarre to talk to protesters at a
  neo-Nazi-linked rally about climate change or hear them rant unprompted about
  heat pumps. But far-right parties have entered the political mainstream, and
  their scathing tirades against “woke” green rules are energising their base.
  That shift is one of several powerful trends that have pushed advocates of
  climate action on to the back foot – and made the rigorous journalism that
  many of our readers support even more impactful. From the Trump administration
  waging war on its environment agencies to the EU ripping up its Green Deal,
  political resistance to cutting pollution is mounting even as the costs of
  extreme weather soar. I joined the Guardian as its European environment
  correspondent two years ago and have spent much of that time investigating the
  forces holding back the shift to a clean economy. The question has taken me to
  rich and run-down German towns that have become strongholds of the anti-green
  right; through idyllic Portuguese villages threatened by the lithium mines
  that are needed to replace petrol cars; and on to the decks of diesel-guzzling
  superyachts in a Mediterranean tax haven. Much of our work involves tracking
  the groups working to destroy the environment. The far right has unexpectedly
  made green-bashing its number two priority – a strategy its voters seem to
  tolerate, if not reward – and its increasingly ferocious attacks are giving
  established parties an excuse to scrap protections they never fully backed. At
  the same time, big oil has used the political shift it helped create to double
  down on fossil fuels, scrapping promises to invest in renewables and hitting
  activists with spurious lawsuits. My colleagues and I increasingly hold their
  corporate enablers to account: from the public affairs firms lobbying on their
  behalf to water down climate policy to the banks financing “carbon bomb”
  projects that will blow through the dwindling CO2 budget. As these powerful
  forces gain influence in governments and boardrooms around the world, it is
  little surprise that many readers feel dismay. Climate scientists do, too. But
  experts also warn that we underestimate our own agency. Two reporting trips
  have crystallised this line of thinking for me. The first was asking dozens of
  people at the Monaco Yacht Show how they felt about their carbon footprints.
  Surrounded by multimillionaires living in luxury, I heard excuses for
  polluting lifestyles that ranged from feeling like individual action doesn’t
  make a difference to blaming China to arguing that people with bigger yachts
  were the real problem. It was absurd – and strikingly similar to how
  middle-class people in rich countries justify their holiday flights and SUVs.
  The second was visiting a cook in a local hospital that has begun to serve its
  patients a mostly vegetarian diet. Convincing older Germans to swap schnitzel
  for tofu sounds like a hard sell, but he told me it has been made easier by
  the boom in fake meats, which in the last decade have become much more
  realistic. The tiny vegetarian percentage of the population in the 2010s
  created enough demand to spur companies to massively invest in how good
  replacements taste. Today, those improvements are making it easy for
  health-conscious meat-eaters – a far bigger group – to cut down their
  consumption. From home renovations to country-sweeping protests, and from
  supermarket trolleys to class-action lawsuits, there are countless examples of
  climate progress that challenge the prevailing apathy. The ways we shop, vote,
  live, work and save have meaningful ripple effects that – together – can cut
  pollution and push governments to act with urgency. The Guardian has long been
  at the forefront of agenda-setting climate journalism, and the generous
  support our readers provide allows us to push those boundaries even as the
  crisis escalates. In a news cycle dominated by autocrats and war, I am
  particularly grateful that our editors – who are free from the pressures of
  corporate owners – refuse to let the health of the planet slip out of sight.
  The Guardian relies on the small percentage of readers who support our work
  financially, and we are currently in the middle of a three-week campaign
  aiming to reach 40,000 new acts of support. If you’re not already a supporter
