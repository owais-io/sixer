  This summer is set to be the warmest on record for the UK, the Met Office has
  said, after the country experienced four heatwaves. The mean temperature for
  summer is tracking at 16.13C (61.03F), which is significantly above the
  current record of 15.76C set in 2018. Many remember 1976 as being a scorching
  summer with a record heatwave, but this data would relegate that year out of
  the top five warmest summers since records began in 1884. It would mean all
  five warmest summers on record had occurred since 2000. The Met Office
  scientist Emily Carlisle said: “Provisional Met Office statistics show that
  summer 2025 will almost certainly be the warmest summer on record … Unless
  temperatures are around four degrees below average for the rest of August,
  which the forecast does not suggest, it looks like the current record will be
  exceeded. “Of course, there are still a few days left of meteorological summer
  to go, but it’s very unlikely anything will stop summer 2025 from being the
  warmest on record.” The Met Office will officially announce whether or not it
  has been the warmest ever summer on Monday 1 September, when the
  meteorological season, which began on 1 June, ends. June and July had warm
  weather, with four heatwaves including days passing 30C. There has been very
  little rain across much of the country, with England experiencing what the
  government called “nationally significant” water shortfalls. Much of England
  is under a hosepipe ban as reservoirs, rivers and groundwater run dry.
  Although the summer has been consistently warm, there has not been extreme
  heat. The highest temperature recorded to date for 2025 was 35.8C in
  Faversham, Kent, on 1 July, well short of the UK’s all-time high of 40.3C set
  in July 2022. Meteorologists have said this year’s consistent warmth was
  driven by dry ground from spring, high-pressure systems, and unusually warm
  seas around the UK, and minimum temperatures had been exceptionally above
  average. The Met Office said climate breakdown was also to blame, with the UK
  warming at a rate of approximately 0.25C each decade. This summer’s marine
  heatwave was also fuelled by climate breakdown, the Met Office said.
