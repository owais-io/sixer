  Russia says its forces have taken two villages in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk
  region, increasing the military pressure amid struggling international efforts
  to broker an end to the war. Moscow’s forces captured the villages of Sredneye
  and Kleban-Byk along the 1,000km (620 mile) frontline in Donetsk, the Russian
  defence ministry said on Telegram on Saturday. The taking of Kleban-Byk would
  mark a further advance towards Kostiantynivka – a key fortified town on the
  road to Kramatorsk, the location of a major Ukrainian logistics base. Russia
  said on Friday its troops had captured three villages in Donetsk. Ukraine’s
  military did not acknowledge that any of the villages had changed hands. On
  Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said on Telegram its forces had stopped
  a Russian advance and recaptured the village of Zeleny Gai in Donetsk. The
  village was being subjected to new Russian attacks, a military statement said.
  The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. South African
  president Cyril Ramaphosa added his voice to calls for a Russia-Ukraine summit
  during a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “President
  Ramaphosa stressed the urgency of holding bilateral and trilateral meetings
  between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine and the United States as key to
  signal a firm commitment to ending the war,” a statement from Ramaphosa’s
  office said on Saturday. Zelenskyy said he told Ramaphosa he was ready for any
  kind of meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “However, we see that
  Moscow is once again trying to drag everything out even further,” he posted on
  X. Ramaphosa spoke last Monday with Putin, whom he has called a “dear ally”.
  The Pentagon has been blocking Ukraine from using US-made long-range missiles
  to strike targets inside Russia, limiting Kyiv’s ability to employ the weapons
  in its defence, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing US officials. The
  report could not immediately be verified. As the White House has sought to
  persuade Putin to meet Zelenskyy for peace talks, an approval process put in
  place at the Pentagon has kept Ukraine from using the army tactical missile
  systems (Atacms) to launch strikes deep into Russian territory, the WSJ
  reported on Saturday. Russian air defences downed a drone headed for Moscow on
  Saturday and specialists were examining fragments on the ground, Moscow mayor
  Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram. Several airports in central Russia suspended
  operations because of concerns over safe airspace, Russia’s air transport
  agency said. Officials at the airport in St Petersburg, Russia’s
  second-largest city, were quoted by Russian news agencies as saying dozens of
  flights had been delayed. France has summoned the Italian ambassador after
  Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini challenged French president
  Emmanuel Macron for suggesting European soldiers be deployed in Ukraine in a
  postwar settlement, Reuters reported a French diplomatic source as saying on
  Saturday. Asked during the week to comment on Macron’s appeals to deploy
  European soldiers in Ukraine after any such deal with Russia, Salvini used a
  Milanese dialect phrase loosely translatable as “get lost”. “You go there if
  you want. Put your helmet on, your jacket, your rifle and you go to Ukraine,”
  he told reporters, referring to Macron. The family of a British aid volunteer
  reportedly killed in a drone strike in Ukraine have said they are “very
  disappointed” by the response from authorities. Annie Lewis Marffy, 69,
  travelled from her home in Silverton in Devon, south-west England, in May to
  deliver a vehicle packed with supplies in a mission arranged by the non-profit
  Aid Ukraine UK. She was reportedly fatally injured in a Russian drone strike
  on 11 June, according to a police file, while Kramatorsk district police
  department said her body remained in an area of hostilities and could not be
  evacuated. Lewis Marffy’s relatives have asked for a death certificate to be
  issued for the “brave, capable and determined” mother-of-three. “All the
  family, the sisters and the sons, have been very disappointed at the reaction
  of the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] and the lack of
  response from the police,” the relatives said, adding: “The family are
  desperate to get more information.” Ukrainian flags will appear above Downing
  Street and several Whitehall buildings to mark 34 years since Ukraine left the
  Soviet Union, the British government said. The prime minister’s official
  residence at No 10 Downing Street is among the buildings where a flag will fly
  on Sunday. A government spokesperson said: “We stand in solidarity with the
  Ukrainian people, including those who have made a second home here in the UK,
  in the face of continued Russian aggression.”
