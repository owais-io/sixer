  Father Mother Sister Brother review – Blanchett and Rampling pick at family
  guilt in Jarmusch’s delectable triptych

  Jim Jarmusch has made anthology films before: Mystery Train (1989), Night on
  Earth (1991), Coffee and Cigarettes (2003). In fact, he could claim to be the
  pre-eminent specialist in this now very unfashionable movie form. But with his
  new one, a deeply pleasing and gently quietist triptych on the subject of
  family, he is giving us something new and personal. It’s the sense of
  mortality and the gathering cloud of darkness over our heads as we enter
  middle age, a perpetual nagging worry about the health and happiness of our
  elderly parents, with the guilt and sadness of not going to see them, or
  seeing them only rarely, and the related feeling of closeness – or perhaps the
  opposite – with your siblings for whom these parents are the number one topic
  of conversation. Then there’s the feeling of relief mixed with dissatisfaction
  and unease on the long car journey home. The movie is divided into three
  (apparently) unrelated panels of drama, events taking place in parallel in
  three different parts of the world: rural US, Dublin and Paris, and with
  images and gestures that fortuitously echo each other. In the first, Mayim
  Bialik and Adam Driver play siblings Emily and Jeff, making the arduous trip
  out into the countryside to see their ageing dad, played by Tom Waits. His
  place seems chaotic and on the verge of poverty, an instant source of worry to
  them both, and Jeff also reproaches himself with having given his dad money
  over the years. And yet in the course of their awkward visit, they are
  disconcerted to notice what appears to be a genuine Rolex on the old guy’s
  wrist and there is evidence that their father is slyly faking his elderly
  disarray for opaque reasons of his own. Meanwhile, in Dublin, Charlotte
  Rampling plays a characteristically self-possessed and self-assured woman who
  is welcoming her two grownup daughters for their annual visit for tea. She is
  entirely content to make these visits a rarity. They are the trendy Tim (Vicky
  Krieps) with pink hair, and the more staid and uptight Lilith, played, a
  little stagily, by Cate Blanchett, with glasses and sensible shoes. And
  finally, in Paris, siblings Skye and Billy – non-identical twins, in fact –
  are played by Indya Moore and Luka Sabbat; their parents have just died,
  apparently piloting a light aircraft in the Azores, a deadpan-jokey demise
  that the actors carry off with complete real-world seriousness. They pay a
  final visit to their late mum and dad’s Paris apartment, and chat to the
  housekeeper, played by iconic French veteran Françoise Lebrun. And they make a
  trip out to a storage depot and gaze at their parents’ belongings, crammed
  into a lockup. This was the material of their parents’ lives, and Skye and
  Billy have already wonderingly gone through old photos and marriage and birth
  certificates. It all seems like evidence of something. But what? The movie
  returns us to an age-old question: who are or were our parents? Did they have
  real existences before we were born that we will never understand? And are our
  own existences destined to be effaced and rendered irrelevant or taboo by our
  own children? For me, the first and third sections are the most
  naturalistically convincing as portraits of real life, the second is more
  theatrical, although the weird, slyly comic echoes of each other in each of
  the sections undermine or at least complicate this reality effect. You might
  sit through this film waiting for a crisis or a confrontation: some explosion
  of temper or passionate demand for honesty. None will arrive. Basically, there
  is a contentment and calm here, an acceptance and a Zen simplicity that is a
  cleansing of the moviegoing palate, or perhaps the fiction-consuming palate in
  general. It is a film to savour. • Father Mother Sister Brother screened at
  the Venice film festival.
