  More than 50 signatures on New York mayor Eric Adams’ petition to run as an
  independent candidate in November’s election are fraudulent, according to a
  report published on Friday. The Gothamist said it had found 52 signatures from
  people who said their names were forged, including signatures of three people
  who turned out to be dead. The publication cited others who said they were
  deceived into signing the petitions. The discovery, if confirmed, is likely to
  be insignificant to Adams’ independent campaign, which is required to produce
  7,500 signatures to qualify him as a candidate. The Adams campaign has turned
  in nearly 50,000 signatures. Still, the finding adds complexity to a race to
  lead the nation’s largest city that pits the incumbent mayor against
  Democratic party nominee Zohran Mamdani, former New York governor Andrew
  Cuomo, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and ex-prosecutor Jim Walden. Cuomo
  and Walden, like Adams, are running as independents. Flaws in the petition
  system to gain access to the ballot are likely to be tested in the future as
  candidates look for ways to circumvent the ranked-choice primary system, the
  publication said. Candidates typically employ outside contractors to harvest
  signatures. In the case of Adams’ petition operation, the irregularities were
  attributed to at least nine workers who together submitted more than 5,000
  signatures. A single campaign worker collected more than 700 signatures on a
  single day, the outlet said, adding that some appeared to be submitted in
  “strikingly similar handwriting among many residents in a single building”.
  The Adam’s campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment. But
  earlier it had told the Gothamist it expected the companies it hired to follow
  the law, and it would conduct its own review of the signatures. An attorney
  for Adams said the mayor did not direct anyone to break the law and that his
  campaign would “determine whether any corrective action is warranted”. Veteran
  election law attorney Jerry Goldfeder told the publication it is not uncommon
  for invalid signatures to be collected. “ Every now and again, somebody tries
  to cut corners, and they’re generally caught and sometimes those cases are
  referred to the district attorney or the US attorney, and there are
  prosecutions,” Goldfeder said. The report comes amid heightened tensions in
  the city after a gunman killed four people in a midtown office building on
  Monday, including off-duty New York City police officer Didarul Islam,
  Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne and
  property manager Julia Hyman. The Adams administration has urged New Yorkers
  to seek help and support from mental health services if they find themselves
  struggling in the aftermath of the attack, while Mamdani is walking back past
  criticism of the city’s police, saying his prior calls to defund the force
  were “out of step” with his current thinking. “I’m not defunding the police,”
  Mamdani said on Wednesday. “I’m not running to defund the police. “I am
  running as a candidate who is not fixed in time, one that learns and one that
  leads, and part of that means admitting as I have grown. And part of that
  means focusing on the people who deserve to be spoken about.” New York City’s
  mayoral election is scheduled for 4 November.
