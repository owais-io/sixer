  Western United is haemorrhaging cash at a rate of close to a million dollars
  every month, but as the A-Leagues pivot to focus on financial sustainability
  officials are confident the competition’s conga line of outgoing transfers is
  a positive sign for the local game. The Tarneit-based outfit reported a loss
  of almost $11m for the 2023/24 financial year in accounts lodged to Asic this
  week, following a deficit of more than $12m for the preceding period.
  Liabilities exceeded assets by more than $55m, underscoring the urgent need to
  conclude the deal announced in May to sell the club to the US-based Kaminski
  group and its local affiliate, KAM Melbourne. The club is due to appear next
  week at the latest hearing in a winding-up process in federal court brought by
  creditors. “The injection of capital from KAM Melbourne is progressing well
  and conversations are ongoing with all relevant stakeholders,” Western United
  said in a statement on Friday. “With A-League Men pre-season well under way,
  we are looking forward to finalising this process shortly and sharing some
  positive developments in the near future.” The state of Western United remains
  a concern to A-League officials, but the off-season has not been all doom and
  gloom for Australia’s main domestic leagues. The existence of Canberra United
  in the ALW has been secured for another year after the ACT government agreed
  to a new funding package for the 2025/26 season. While League operator
  Australian Professional Leagues (APL) reported crowds in the ALM were up 10%
  last season, along with a 9% increase in Channel 10 audiences, and cumulative
  attendance of almost 1.6 million fans, the highest since 2016/17. However,
  there is tension between the A-Leagues’ identity as a development league and
  its standing as an entertainment product in the Australian marketplace,
  particularly competing against the BBL which is preparing for a possible
  private equity injection. The APL’s executive chair, Stephen Conroy, has
  largely avoided press since taking on the role in February, and the
  organisation declined to comment about the state of the A-Leagues on Friday.
  Conroy announced in April a lower salary cap would be introduced in an effort
  to reduce club costs, but failed to consult Professional Footballers Australia
  prior to the announcement. The PFA chief executive, Beau Busch, said the next
  12 months “offer a pivotal opportunity to reset and strengthen” the ALM and
  ALW. “The players are determined to shape the future of the professional
  leagues through the establishment of a clear, long-term strategic vision,” he
  said. Outgoing men’s transfers tallied $15.7m in 2024/25, an average of more
  than $800,000 each, confirming the league’s as a growing player in the global
  football economy. In the past two seasons there have been 46 deals worth
  nearly $38m, compared with the three previous seasons when 39 transfers netted
  less than $12m. Clubs have earned even more due to sell-on clauses such as the
  one in Adelaide United’s sale of Nestory Irankdunda to Bayern Munich, which
  was triggered by his move this month to Championship club Watford. Socceroos
  winger Craig Goodwin has returned to South Australia this off-season as the
  competition’s highest-profile signing after his stint in Saudi Arabia. But the
  league has lost entertainers such as Marco Tilio, Daniel Arzani, Noah Botic,
  Adrian Segecic and Nicolas Milanovic, as well as Adelaide’s homegrown veteran
  Stefan Mauk who was allowed to leave for a club in Vietnam under a paid loan
  arrangement. The exodus continues in the A-League Women with the recent
  overseas transfers of Matildas Emily Gielnik, Alex Chidiac and Jessika Nash,
  as well as Kahli Johnson who moved in February. The league continues to face
  reputational challenges, including concerns around match-fixing and
  embarrassments such as Perth Glory’s 9-0 loss to AC Milan in an exhibition
  match on Thursday. Momentum for the A-League Women after the 2023 Women’s
  World Cup has also stalled, and the entry of Auckland and Macarthur into the
  competition has been repeatedly delayed. The APL is preparing to enter
  negotiations on its next broadcast agreement starting in 2026-27.
