  People under the age of 22 should get free bus travel to help them access work
  and training in otherwise cut-off communities, a committee of MPs has said,
  urging ministers to show more ambition to reverse a long-term decline in bus
  travel. Plans to devolve powers over bus services to local transport
  authorities are welcome but are not enough on their own to make bus services
  more reliable in smaller towns and rural areas, according to the report by the
  cross-party Commons transport committee. Pointing to a 20% fall in passenger
  numbers across England since 2009, and an 18% drop in the number of routes
  outside cities since Covid, the report cited evidence that more than half of
  small towns were now effectively “transport deserts” for those without a car.
  Its recommendations include that the already-existing English national
  concessionary travel scheme, which gives free bus travel to retired people and
  people with certain disabilities, should be extended to anyone aged under 22,
  at any time of the day, starting with a pilot scheme. “This would support
  access to work and skills opportunities for younger people and help embed
  long-term public transport use,” it said. Last year, the Department for
  Transport (DfT) promised a “bus revolution” across England, with local
  transport authorities allowed to run and control bus services, as is already
  the case in London and Greater Manchester. The committee acknowledged that
  this would help provide locally-suitable policies, but warned that it would
  probably have a limited effect in addressing disparities in bus services, with
  areas outside cities unlikely to be able to make significant improvements.
  “There is no consensus that structural reform alone can achieve aims such as
  increased connectivity, better integration and more affordable journeys,” the
  report concluded. It said ministers should make sure all local transport
  authorities that run bus services offered minimum service levels by the end of
  this parliament, helped by guaranteed long-term funding, including multiyear
  settlements for bus services. Other recommendations included a possible rural
  weighting for bus funding, and minimum standards for bus stops, including
  real-time information about the next services. Ministers should, in the next
  18 months, set out a national policy for buses in England – transport is a
  devolved policy – with “a clear vision for what a successful bus network looks
  like and what it should achieve”, the committee said. A DfT spokesperson said:
  “After decades of decline, we’re providing a record £1bn in multi-year funding
  to improve the reliability and frequency of bus services across the country.
  “Our landmark bus services bill will protect routes and prevent services from
  being scrapped, bringing buses back into local control, and will put
  passengers at the heart of services. We have also stepped in to prevent a fare
  hike for passengers by extending the £3 fare cap until March 2027.”
