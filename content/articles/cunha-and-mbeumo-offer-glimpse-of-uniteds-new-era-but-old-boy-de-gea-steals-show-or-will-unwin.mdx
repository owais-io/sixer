  David de Gea’s appearance between the sticks at Old Trafford was a moment of
  nostalgia for Manchester United fans, a reminder of better times. The
  goalkeeper’s departure at the end of the 2022-2023 season epitomises the
  club’s self-inflicted problems, the sort of business ineptitude that has
  scarred United and Sir Jim Ratcliffe will demand is a thing of the past. When
  André Onana, a goalkeeper well-known to the then manager Erik ten Hag, was
  available for nothing, United allowed De Gea to run down his contract and then
  spent £40m on the Cameroonian a year later. The logic was lost on everyone,
  missing out on a fee for the Spaniard, despite a subpar final season, and then
  splashing out on an inferior replacement. De Gea took a season off and
  returned to become the best in class in Serie A. He was the first Fiorentina
  player sent out to warm up 45 minutes before kick-off at Old Trafford and was
  given a standing ovation. After all, he won the club’s player of the year on
  four occasions. Things need to be different with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo
  and Benjamin Sesko. They are replacements for high-quality individuals who,
  for various reasons, are not wanted by Ruben Amorim. Few can doubt Marcus
  Rashford, now at Barcelona, is a world-class forward and Alejandro Garnacho
  has the potential to be one of the best wingers on the planet. Chelsea are
  keen to sign him. United’s new front three has cost more than £200m, a sum
  they will not recoup in sales this summer. Rashford’s wages are being covered,
  Jadon Sancho is proving difficult to shift and Antony is awaiting offers but a
  loan is likely. With Sesko in the stands after the confirmation of his
  transfer on Saturday morning, Mason Mount was, surprisingly, given the false
  No 9 role, with Mbeumo and Cunha behind to begin with. There was a flow in the
  final third as the players swapped positions, although that is unlikely next
  weekend against Arsenal when Sesko is available and Amorim acknowledged United
  “struggled without a reference as a striker” in his rigid 3-4-3 formation.
  Rasmus Højlund stayed on the bench, as United went 90 minutes without a
  traditional No 9, an indication of the Dane’s prospects. It is difficult to
  learn much about United on this showing. Amorim said he should be judged after
  a full pre-season with the squad. Come the start of the Premier League, United
  will be different, as Sesko will be demanding crosses and passes in behind,
  tactics not possible with Mount as the most advanced forward. The focus on
  Saturday was on Mbeumo and Cunha, to see what they bring to a team that lacked
  ideas, creativity and clinical finishing on their way scoring 44 goals in 38
  Premier League games and finished 15th. Mbeumo brought a collection of neat
  touches, bringing teammates into play, but Amorim said United had a “lack of
  fluidity”. That said, the Cameroon international’s lightness of touch and
  thought was enough to give optimism. Attitude is imperative for Amorim, and
  Mbeumo showed dogged determination to win the ball and chased everything, even
  if it was forlorn. The manager wants players to set the tempo, that the bare
  minimum required is 100% effort and Mbeumo has that. In a game played at
  nowhere near full speed, United still lacked mobility from their central
  midfield duo of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. Cunha, on the other hand, is
  known for walking around the pitch when the ball is not at his feet. When it
  is, however, he comes alive. He can carry it through defensive lines, turning
  opponents. Excitement has been lacking at Old Trafford and a player like Cunha
  can inspire the crowd. Replica Cunha shirts are already popular with fans with
  the names of Cantona, Beckham and Ronaldo on their backs, because supporters
  love a maverick. During a break in play, Amorim beckoned Cunha to offer
  detailed instructions, an indicator that the Brazilian still has plenty to
  learn. For Sesko to be served, United’s wing-backs will be important. One the
  right, Amad Diallo brought his own brand of dribbling to attack but without
  the telling final ball reaching a United player. While the front three has
  been overhauled, everything behind remains unchanged, so the ease with which
  United conceded the opening goal was concerning. Two Fiorentina players were
  left unmarked at the back post from a corner, allowing Simon Sohm a simple
  finish from 12 yards. It was not the confidence-boosting start United’s
  defence or Altay Bayindir desired. After a Robin Gosens own goal brought the
  equaliser, the shootout was settled when Fabiano Parisi’s penalty was saved by
  the stand-in goalkeeper before Kobbie Mainoo scored to make it 5-4 and United
  the winners. Fiorentina are United’s only European opposition this season,
  allowing plenty of time for bonding on the training ground between the new
  arrivals. Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko may hope to one day receive a send-off like
  De Gea, who was substituted with minutes to go, receiving his third ovation of
  the day. United’s hierarchy will be hoping they were waving goodbye to a past
  era as they look to ignite a new one.
