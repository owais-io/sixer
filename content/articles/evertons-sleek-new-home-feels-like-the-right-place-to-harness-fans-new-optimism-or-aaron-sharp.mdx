  As the old song goes, Everton are a football club that know well their
  history. But now, finally, the future is here. If Goodison Park was a temple
  to Everton’s rich and storied past, Hill Dickinson Stadium represents
  something long desired for the future, a great leap forward in their ambition
  to host a world-class football team. In truth, it is much needed. Proud though
  Evertonians are of their club’s sleeping giant status, the club have too long
  traded on the former glories chronicled in songs of the Glwadys Street end.
  Here, on a sun-drenched afternoon on the banks of the River Mersey, change and
  optimism was the tune of the day – and the architect Dan Meis’s 52,000-seat
  stadium, a sleek, stylish construction of glass and steel feels like the right
  place to harness that spirit. It is a long time to spend in one place, 133
  years. Perhaps it was the sheer newness of it all that had fans ambling at
  half speed, seemingly awestruck up Regent Road, the site of their new ground,
  stopping for family selfies and to take videos for social media. More likely
  it was the stadium itself, which seems to rise out of the river when
  approached from the nearby Eldonian Village estate, that gave early arrivals
  their moment for pause. Its roof, a flowing arch of polished steel, glints
  like a swallow’s wing in the early afternoon sunlight. A successful season
  cannot be guaranteed by the move into their new home – as Everton’s opening
  defeat at Leeds showed – but there is undoubtedly a feeling of joy around this
  place. Inside, families swept around the spacious concourse which flows around
  the stadium almost in homage to the rolling river behind. It is a marked
  departure from the visceral experience of navigating entry to Goodison – a
  weekly ritual of charting a course through a crush of people meandering out of
  narrow streets, dodging chip wrappers, parked cars and plastic pint glasses
  along the way. Although the experience on Sunday wasn’t faultless, with some
  fans complaining of long queues for the bar and bottlenecks in busy areas. But
  of course the true test of Hill Dickinson Stadium’s suitability would be what
  happened inside. With 10 minutes to kick-off came evidence of one thing the
  designers had thought about very carefully. As a booming sound system dialled
  up, nervous energy in the stands soon became a simmering anticipation.
  Acoustics is not a word which often comes up in conversations among football
  fans – Evertonians may rightly be more concerned with their lack of full-backs
  than a world-class PA system – but the way Hill Dickinson Stadium retains the
  thrum of fan excitement invoked a physical response here. There She Goes, the
  90s indie song by the scouser band the La’s, is now a fan anthem after it
  became part of Goodison Park’s swan song. Here it was the first song roared in
  unison by the packed stadium in full voice. It is magnificent – a bittersweet
  goodbye turned soundtrack for the future, exactly what the occasion called
  for. And then, as kick-off approached, this roomy, comfortable feat of
  21st-century design felt all of a sudden very familiar – old school, even. The
  Evertonians went through the usual pre-match routine of songs, before the old
  battle cry went up. A roar for Z-Cars bolstered by the 10,000 or so extra
  voices all this modernity can accommodate. Those who knew Goodison will know
  that its silences could be as deafening as its crescendos – the clattering of
  wooden seats announcing an early half-time pint after a disappointing start.
  How those moments of disillusion play out in this new, more sanitary
  environment, we will have to wait to find out. The determination of the home
  fans to turn their European-style bowl into a bear pit meant the atmosphere
  buzzed throughout an at times patchy Everton performance. Their game effort
  was rewarded when Jack Grealish, surely a cult-hero in the making, set up the
  first goal of this new era – finding Iliman Ndiaye, whose finish induced the
  kind roar which would test the mettle of any roof. That outpouring of elation
  and relief, which are often the same thing where Everton are concerned, were
  only matched when Jordan Pickford – a cult hero firmly established – saved a
  penalty which all but guaranteed a victorious start to life by the river. Here
  was a thoroughly Everton afternoon. Not perfect, by any means. But a step
  forward, willed into being by the support of a faithful blue army of fans who
  finally got their moment in the sun. They may no longer reside among the
  terrace houses of L4 but they are, as another of those old songs says, the
  Goodison gang. A new postcode does not appear to have changed that.
