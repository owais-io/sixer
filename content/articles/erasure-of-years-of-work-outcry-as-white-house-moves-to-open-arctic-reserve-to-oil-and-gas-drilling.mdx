  to oil and gas drilling

  The Trump administration’s plan to expand oil and gas drilling in a 23m acre
  reserve on the Arctic Ocean is sparking an impassioned response, amid fears it
  threatens Arctic wildlife, undermines the subsistence rights of Alaska Natives
  and imperils one of the fastest-warming ecosystems on Earth. More than a
  quarter of a million people have responded to the 2 June proposal from the US
  Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to roll back protections on the National
  Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), the largest tract of public land in the US.
  A man from Georgia described hearing from an oil company that an employee shot
  a mother polar bear after encountering her with two cubs in northern Alaska.
  “I beg you to reconsider … I’m just 18 years old and haven’t had a chance to
  see the real world yet,” said a teenager from Denmark. “This will make that
  impossible – if not in the whole world, then at least in the icy areas of our
  planet.” The staggering number of comments submitted during the two-month
  comment period showed the public was watching, said Andy Moderow, senior
  director of policy at the Alaska Wilderness League. “That’s a pretty large
  turnout of Americans saying this is not the direction we need in the Arctic.”
  The BLM rollback is part of a broad, rapid-fire regulatory push to
  industrialize the Alaskan Arctic, particularly the NPR-A. Weeks after
  proposing to strip protections from the reserve, the Department of Interior
  signaled it would adopt a management plan that would open 82% of the NPR-A to
  oil drilling. Two weeks ago, before the public comment period had ended, the
  BLM rescinded three other Biden-era documents protecting the reserve. The
  Alaska Wilderness League, an Alaska-focused conservation non-profit, said the
  administration’s decision to start dismantling protections for the NPR-A
  before the comment period concluded showed “a lack of interest in meaningfully
  reviewing any input before taking action to allow unfettered industrialization
  across this landscape”. Alaska Native groups, some of which have worked for
  years to secure protections for areas of the NPR-A, also expressed
  frustration. The rollback is “a coordinated erasure of years of work by Alaska
  Native communities”, said Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic in a press
  statement. “To have all the work we’ve done for the last two decades, trying
  to create important special areas with their unique biological features
  demonstrated by science, disregarded to allow full-force development is crazy
  to consider,” said Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, an activist and former mayor of
  Nuiqsut, Alaska, a village in the NPR-A. The BLM said in a statement it was
  working through all comments received on the 2024 NPR-A rule rescission, and
  that it would respond to substantive comments in the final rule. The White
  House referred the Guardian to the BLM when asked for comment. ‘Devastating’
  change Under Trump, the Department of Interior has embarked on a push to
  promote resource extraction in the Arctic, vowing to expand oil and gas in the
  NPR-A, open oil leasing on the coastal plain of the Arctic national wildlife
  refuge, and advance a controversial mining road in the southern Brooks range.
  The total land in play from these proposals is nearly 25m acres (10m hectares)
  of Arctic ecosystem, an area larger than the state of Indiana. The NPR-A
  comprises the vast majority of this. The reserve supports home grounds for
  polar bears, calving areas for caribou, and habitat for millions of migratory
  birds from Africa and Europe, as well as the Americas. In 2023, the Biden
  administration began consultations with Alaska Native groups and other
  stakeholders to update existing rules on how the NPR-A should be managed.
  These consultations led to the 2024 rule which the BLM now aims to rescind.
  That rule protects key areas in the NPR-A for subsistence use and habitat,
  including Teshekpuk Lake, the Utukok Uplands and the Colville River.
  Ahtuangaruak, who participated in the 2023 consultations, said removing these
  protections could be “very devastating rapidly”. She described a worsening
  ecological situation across the reserve, partly driven by existing oil
  development. Caribou herds were declining, she said, and some had shifted
  their migration patterns away from her village because of oil and gas
  development to the west of her village. Permafrost was thawing, causing
  freshwater Arctic lakes to drain. Ice roads separated caribou calves from
  caribou cows; polar bears struggled to den in the melting snowpack. Tim
  Fullman, a senior ecologist at the Wilderness Society, a US conservation
  non-profit, said that already-existing roads in the Alaskan Arctic had been
  shown to hinder caribou movement, at times delaying migrating animals for up
  to a month. Then there’s the perennial health impacts on communities from gas
  flaring in the NPR-A, which Ahtuangaruak said she began to notice in the early
  2000s when she was a healthcare worker. “The flares, when there’d be 20 or
  more, there would be nights where people would have trouble breathing,” she
  said. “Babies would start to have events. There was one point where we had 20
  babies develop respiratory distress and 10 of them were put on ventilators.”
  Oil for decades Thirty miles east of Nuiqsut, Ahtuangaruak’s village, is the
  ConocoPhillips Willow project, a drilling operation approved in March 2023
  under the Biden administration. Still under construction, it is projected to
  come online in 2029. Once it begins to produce, Willow will be operational for
  at least 30 years, according to its environmental impact statement. The
  project is an example of the timeframe involved in the Arctic oil and gas
  projects the Trump administration is currently encouraging, says Moderow –
  spanning decades. “We’re not talking about oil next year. We’re talking about
  oil in 2050 and 2060 and beyond, when we need to move past it,” he said. The
  projects “could easily be pumping oil when babies born today are retiring in a
  climate that’s not livable if that oil is not blocked”. “It’s investing in
  production that’s going to be going on for decades, well past when we need to
  be at essentially net zero greenhouse gas emissions if we’re going to have a
  livable climate,” said Jeremy Lieb, a senior attorney at Earthjustice.
