  School is out, young audiences are available, and yet still, Hollywood
  animation is having a bad summer at the box office. In contrast to last year,
  when Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4 occupied two of the season’s top three
  (and combined for about $2.7bn worldwide), it seems entirely possible that not
  a single fully animated movie will crack the top 10. Adding insult to injury:
  the Disney-Pixar original Elio has been trounced by “live-action” remakes of
  Lilo &amp; Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, which faithfully reproduce old
  cartoons with bland new actors and CG visual effects. With younger audiences
  steered toward those movies and seemingly also welcomed into big-tent hits
  like Superman and Jurassic World: Rebirth, it’s all the more remarkable that
  Netflix has somehow managed to have its biggest animated movie ever. KPop
  Demon Hunters, about a trio of women who form a pop group while moonlighting
  as, yes, demon hunters, was released in June – on the same weekend as Elio, no
  less – and has become a soundtrack-selling, replay-friendly phenom. Netflix
  numbers can be opaque, but there’s confirmation in Golden, a centerpiece song
  from the movie, hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. When was the last time a
  Disney movie made a play for song of the summer? Animation seems like a safe
  bet for budget-conscious streaming content. After all, the much-lamented cost
  of a movie ticket is tripled or quadrupled when bringing a family (and then
  maybe tripled again if they want snacks). On a per-person basis, streaming a
  new cartoon is the more affordable option. But even after poaching film-makers
  from major animation studios, the streamers have struggled with original
  material; Netflix’s The Sea Beast isn’t anywhere near as good as Moana, with
  which it shares a co-director, and its Over the Moon (the directorial debut of
  Glen Keane, a longtime Disney animator) is downright ghastly. Spellbound, from
  Skydance’s attempt to start their own animation house led by the disgraced
  former Pixar honcho John Lasseter, arrived with barely a peep last
  Thanksgiving. Most of the time, the Netflix charts are dominated by older
  animated titles from established studios like DreamWorks and Illumination. So
  why did KPop Demon Hunters break through? Maybe it helps that it isn’t an
  in-house Netflix production; the movie was actually produced by Sony Pictures
  Animation, the studio that worked such genre-bending magic with the
  Spider-Verse movies. KPop isn’t quite as ambitiously style-forward as that
  series, but it shares the same basic visual approach of intentionally choppy
  but eye-catching, shapeshifting animation that imitates both comic-book splash
  pages and anime, splattered in purple and pink hues. It’s not clear when Sony
  decided they would pursue a streaming release, but Netflix previously
  distributed the similarly manic (and original) The Mitchells vs the Machines
  when the pandemic delayed its planned theatrical release. The Netflix-Sony
  cartoons seem to indicate that maybe there’s more cultural cachet in standing
  out from the animation crowd, rather than doing off-brand versions of
  Disney-style songs and Pixar-style secret worlds. In particular, KPop Demon
  Hunters seems freer to capitalize on a cultural trend than its mainstream
  competition. Disney has become so self-conscious about its own iconography
  that its last non-sequel in-house animated feature, Wish, was an extended
  100th-anniversary celebration for its parent company, packed with references
  to their animated classics. Their big release for this fall is Zootopia 2, a
  stringing out from a great original idea they debuted almost a decade ago. The
  other big US animation houses are similarly sequel-fixated; the last big
  animated release of the summer is The Bad Guys 2, from DreamWorks. Not only is
  KPop Demon Hunters not a sequel, nor even a comics adaptation, it feels
  engaged with a world outside of its parent company, no matter how heightened
  its wild fantasy action becomes. By making the central characters a K-pop
  group, the movie finds something that breaks the princess/talking
  animal/scrappy kid hegemony. It’s about young-adult characters with major
  responsibilities (even if those responsibilities involve the equally
  fantastical pop-girlie grind and Buffy-esque demon-fighting), carried out with
  an aspirational big-sister energy that younger kids can watch with wide-eyed
  admiration usually reserved for Disney princesses. American interest in K-pop
  may have even peaked; technically, the optimal time for this movie might have
  been circa 2021 – not coincidentally, the year the movie’s production was
  announced. But though KPop Demon Hunters has some adult themes and scary
  monsters, it’s also pitched young enough that it’s almost better-equipped than
  if it had come at the height of the BTS craze. The movie very much repackages
  K-pop for an even-broader audience of native English speakers (something K-pop
  itself has been doing for years at this point) in a way that draws from the
  trend’s fandom without relying exclusively on it. Demon Hunters also
  constructs a fantasy version of the pop machine, particularly the astonishing
  levels of training received by a lot of K-pop acts; here, all the girls’ hard
  work is entirely at the behest of their own artistic vision, and they
  rise-and-grind off the couch voluntarily, not because a music label is forcing
  them. It’s probably no accident that the lower reaches of the movie’s audience
  are probably also discovering their own music for the first time – and making
  their preferences known on the charts, as a whopping nine songs from KPop
  Demon Hunter are currently on the Billboard Hot 100. That closeness to the pop
  world also allows the movie to make pop stars its dauntless heroines and
  devious villains all at once. (The demons disguised as a boy band sing an
  infectious ditty called Soda Pop that even the movie’s demon-savvy characters
  can’t really resist.) So much pop taste formation involves sussing out what
  you find irresistible versus what you find deeply annoying, two qualities that
  can reverse themselves with surprising ease. Even if KPop Demon Hunters is
  ultimately more about self-acceptance and friendship than the dynamics of pop
  music, it’s letting a younger audience try out pop fandom. In that way, it
  welcomes those viewers into the kind of faux-grownup world that they often get
  from PG-13 live-action superhero movies. As with superheroes, the response to
  this movie’s success will mostly be “make sequels to this specific movie,
  forever” with a possible dash of “streaming animation is really happening this
  time!” It shouldn’t be, though. In the wake of so many sequels from Disney,
  Pixar, Illumination and DreamWorks, KPop Demon Hunters is a reminder that kids
  in particular hunger for novelty, probably more so than their nostalgia-drunk
  adult counterparts. Despite their ongoing enthusiasm for any number of cartoon
  franchises, family audiences aren’t just waiting around for Despicable Me 5.
  They are hoping, conscious or not, for something with more pop.
