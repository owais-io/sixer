  Retired women in the UK in effect go four months of the year without a pension
  when their income is compared with that of men, union leaders have warned. The
  TUC said the income gap between men and women in retirement was 36.5%,
  equivalent to a shortfall of £7,600 a year on average. As a percentage this
  was more than double the gender pay gap, which measures the difference in
  average earnings from work; it stands at 13.1%. The union organisation said
  this meant that retired women effectively stopped receiving a pension from 21
  August when compared with men, creating a four-month gap. Paul Nowak, the
  general secretary of the TUC, said the income gap between men and women in
  retirement should be central to the inquiry by the pensions commission, which
  the government launched last month. “Everyone deserves dignity and security in
  retirement, but too many retired women have been left without enough to get
  by,” said Nowak. “We must make sure that these inequalities are addressed for
  future generations.” The commission is expected to examine why retirement
  incomes have failed to meet expectations after reforms more than a decade ago
  forced employers to autoenrol staff in occupational pension schemes. Unions,
  employers organisations and pension experts will consider the best way to
  tackle the shortfalls. Based on annual research by the Prospect union, the
  report published by the TUC found that the gender pension gap was closing
  steadily each year as more women were able to save for retirement, but
  progress was slow. It said: “Prospect’s annual estimate of the gap is on a
  downward trend, driven by a reduction in the gender pay gap, historic
  increases in employment rates for women, and state pension changes. Between
  2011-12 and 2022-23 it fell from 44.9% to 36.5%.” At about one percentage
  point a year, the decline in gender inequality will take until at least 2061
  to close. The report highlights how income and gender inequality in retirement
  are larger than in the working population after decades when women, who take
  more time off work for caring responsibilities than men, miss out on pension
  contributions. The report said: “The fact that women on average earn less than
  men in work means that, even if the pension participation gap was closed, they
  would still build up their pot more slowly than male colleagues. Women’s
  average hourly pay is currently 13.1% lower than men’s, rising to 18.9% for
  workers in their 50s.” Nowak said: “We now have a chance to make sure
  everyone, including women, receive the decent retirement income that all
  workers need.”
