  Your correspondent who feels no display of the national flag could possibly
  give offence is, at best, naive (Letters, 31 August). If I turned up in their
  street in a balaclava and put up a dozen EU flags, would they regard this as a
  neutral act? It would, of course, be a political statement. There is also the
  matter of permissions. As a city councillor I spend a good part of my time
  having unauthorised displays removed. This is mostly graffiti, but includes
  signboards and advertisements. Very few residents want a free-for-all on the
  streets, and the same applies to unauthorised flags. I have asked the council
  to remove the small number of flags that have appeared in my area, plus the
  red stripe graffiti on traffic roundabouts. It’s clear they are nothing to do
  with celebrating our country, but a far-right attempt at intimidation. Genuine
  patriots don’t hide behind masks and disregard local community rules. Cllr
  Phil Davis Billesley Ward, Birmingham • In the 1920s the Nazis adopted a
  Buddhist peace symbol (the swastika) and made it their own. Anyone flying one
  now is assumed to be a Nazi, not a Buddhist. Its hard on all the Buddhists,
  but here we are. In the UK, the St George’s cross is mostly seen at far-right
  demonstrations, like the one at which gangs of violent thugs attempted to burn
  down a hotel, with the immigrant residents inside. Anyone flying the St
  George’s cross now is assumed to be a far-right racist. It’s hard on all the
  patriots, but here we are. It no longer means what it used to. Neil Knowles
  London • Recently in Birkenhead, Wirral, a union jack was tied to the railings
  of a Muslim centre. It was untied and flown from the windows. While intended
  to cause offence, the leaders told the BBC that “a strong and powerful
  response would be to show that this is our flag and we are proud British
  Muslims”. Maybe it is time for all organisations hated by the far right to
  reclaim their flag. Most British people and businesses are not generally flag
  flyers, but as a regular visitor to Wales, I am very used to seeing the Welsh
  people’s pride in their nation shown in the use of their national flag. Lorna
  Walker Liverpool • The far right should not be allowed to take over national
  symbols, such as the flag. Take the example of Brazil, where in 2018-19 the
  far right took to the streets campaigning with the green and yellow Brazilian
  flag and wearing national football shirts, claiming they were patriots in
  opposition to the “others” that were not. To oppose it, the left flew the red
  flag of the PT (the local workers’ party) and wore red shirts. From that time
  on, the far right fixed national symbols to their ideology, and the centre or
  left opposition was not able to recover them. So, I would strongly recommend
  that Britons hang on to their national symbols. It is important that the
  government, as well as all democratic parties, clearly state that they support
  the national flag, that they all are patriots too. Nelson A Rocha Cascais,
  Portugal
