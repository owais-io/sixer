  What’s the problem? We moved house two years ago, and some rooms in our new
  home have very little natural light. The plants we brought with us aren’t
  thriving. What houseplants can cope with low light levels? Diagnosis Many
  popular houseplants, especially those that need bright, indirect light, will
  struggle in dimly lit spaces. Symptoms like yellowing leaves, leggy growth and
  overall decline are common when plants aren’t getting enough light to
  photosynthesise properly. But all is not lost. Several houseplants are far
  more tolerant of low light and can thrive in shadier spots. The key is
  selecting species that originate from environments where filtered light is the
  norm. Prescription For rooms with very low light, opt for things like snake
  plants (Sansevieria), ZZ plants (Zamioculcas zamiifolia), cast iron plants
  (Aspidistra elatior), pothos (Epipremnum aureum) and peace lilies
  (Spathiphyllum wallisii). These are all very resilient. Shade-tolerant plants
  usually have a higher concentration of chlorophyll, allowing them to tolerate
  lower light levels without showing immediate stress. Prevention Even
  low-light-tolerant plants need some light to survive. Rotate them regularly to
  encourage even growth, and consider supplementing with a small grow light if
  natural light is minimal. Water little, as low light levels slow down a
  plant’s water usage, increasing the risk of root rot.
