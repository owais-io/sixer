  Rakib Hossain was just 11 years old when, standing innocently on the streets
  of Dhaka in July last year, he was killed by a bullet to the head – fired
  allegedly by the police. Hossain was one of more than 1,400 men, women and
  children killed in Bangladesh’s so-called July revolution, when hundreds of
  thousands across the country rose up in protest against the country’s leader,
  Sheikh Hasina. Her attempts to crush the mass movement included deploying
  heavily armed police, who – with shoot to kill orders – fired live ammunition
  at civilians on the streets. Ultimately, the crackdown was unsuccessful and
  Hasina was forced to flee Bangladesh in a helicopter on 5 August last year, as
  angry protesters marched towards her residence and the military refused to
  forcefully stop them. Now, just over a year since he was killed, the trial of
  Hasina will begin on 3 August, as she stands accused of being responsible for
  the death of the 11-year-old and many others over those weeks. After months of
  evidence gathering, Bangladeshi prosecutors have charged her with crimes
  against humanity, including charges of order, incitement, complicity,
  conspiracy, and abetment of murder, torture and other inhuman acts. Her trial
  will be held before three judges of Bangladesh’s international crimes tribunal
  (ICT); a court that Hasina set up herself while in power. Hasina will not be
  there. Since last August, she has been in India despite protests by the
  interim government leading Bangladesh. Multiple extradition requests for
  Hasina have been ignored. With the possibility she would be given the death
  penalty if found guilty, few believe Hasina will come back voluntarily. She
  has refused to be part of the proceedings except to plead not guilty, and has
  been given a state-appointed defence lawyer as she is being tried in absentia.
  In the days leading up to the trial, efforts have been made by Hasina and her
  Awami League party to discredit it and the tribunal, denying the charges and
  claiming they had received no formal legal notices of them. In an open letter
  published on Friday, Hasina described the protests that toppled her as a
  “violent interruption of our hard-fought democracy” and promised to “reclaim
  the institutions that were unlawfully seized”. Hossain’s father, Abul Khayer,
  spoke of his anger that Hasina would not be present in court. “I want to see
  Hasina tried in person,” he said. “She should face the families and answer for
  what she did. But India won’t give her back. Everyone knows that.” A year
  since his son was killed, Khayer said his grief had hardened into
  disillusionment and he expressed doubts that the tribunal would deliver true
  justice or accountability. After the toppling of Hasina a wave of optimism
  gripped Bangladesh, as an interim government led by Nobel prize-winner
  Muhammad Yunus was brought in with sweeping promises of democratic reform and
  accountability. But faith in the interim government has faded over the past
  year as many of the promised reforms have failed to materialise and Yunus has
  struggled to bring the deteriorating law and order situation and attacks
  against minorities under control. With the country’s first elections since the
  fall of Hasina due in February, Khayer feared the trial would become
  politicised. “Everyone has seen in the past how most often these kinds of
  cases have been used to gain political scores,” he said. “The trials are
  dragged for years to serve people’s political ambition.” Still, he insisted
  the trial should still go forward, if only to document the truth. “I don’t
  need her to sit in a dock to know what she did. She gave the orders. Everyone
  knows that. Let the world hear it.” For the many who saw their relatives and
  friends killed last July, the trial is a vital first step towards justice.
  While some senior government ministers and police officials were arrested,
  many in Hasina’s regime fled the country and remain abroad. In an effort to
  make the trial as transparent as possible, much of it will be live streamed on
  television, except for moments where sensitive witnesses are testifying. It is
  also just the beginning. Investigators are still working on bringing Hasina to
  trial for a ream of other atrocities allegedly committed during her 15 years
  in power, including enforced disappearances and the killing, torture and mass
  incarceration of opponents and critics. Mohammad Tajul Islam, the chief
  prosecutor of the ICT, said the prosecution and investigation agency of the
  court had been “working relentlessly” since September to find witnesses and
  gather evidence to bring Hasina to trial. He described it as a “very
  challenging task, particularly because destruction of evidence and the
  involvement of a huge number of perpetrators”. Islam noted that some of those
  allegedly involved remained in positions of power, often making victims and
  witnesses reluctant to come forward. He said he was confident that the
  prosecution had a strong case to prove crimes against humanity were committed
  by Hasina. Among the key witnesses will be her former police chief Chowdhury
  Abdullah al-Mamun, who has already pleaded guilty and agreed to testify
  against the former prime minister. While some have questioned whether
  Bangladesh’s judicial system – which was systematically eroded under Hasina –
  was capable of conducting a free and fair trial for Hasina, Islam said reforms
  had brought the ICT in line with international best practices. “It is critical
  for accountability and the rule of law, and also for the victims who seek
  justice,” he said. “Her intended absence from the trial should not shield her
  from justice.” Mohammad Arafat, who served as a senior minister in Hasina’s
  government and is also facing charges, called the tribunal a “political show
  trial”. “The Awami League categorically rejects the politically motivated
  charges brought against its leadership,” he said. “I urge the international
  community to recognise this tribunal for what it is: a tool to criminalise
  political opposition and rewrite lawful governance as criminality.” Mubashar
  Hasan, a political scientist who was forced into exile after he was abducted
  and tortured and is now a researcher at Western Sydney University, was among
  those who said that in an “ideal scenario” Hasina would instead be put on
  trial at the international criminal court in The Hague. The Yunus-led interim
  government has already banned Hasina’s Awami League party from taking part in
  the elections expected early next year, but critics have said this undermines
  the democratic nature of the polls, given that Awami League is still one of
  the country’s largest parties. The election is expected to be swept by the
  Bangladesh Nationalist party, whose leadership suffered years of persecution
  under Hasina. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islamist party which was banned
  under Hasina, is also expected to do well, which has raised concerns about the
  rise of Islamic hardliners undermining the country’s secular foundations.
