  What’s in a name? Potentially a lot, if you are launching a movement with
  ambitions “to shape something truly transformative” in British politics.
  That’s the challenge facing Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, the former Labour
  MPs who announced plans last month, if not in the most coordinated fashion, to
  launch a leftwing political party. More than 600,000 people have already
  signed up for updates on the new group, which will be called … what? “The
  members will get to choose,” Sultana said earlier this week, as a consultation
  on the subject closed. It will not be called Your Party, however, despite
  having launched on a website with precisely that name. Her own preference is
  the Left Party, “because that’s what it says on the tin … We’ll obviously put
  that to the members and we’ll see what we get”. The fact that so many have
  already signed up to a nameless project might suggest that what it is
  eventually called matters less than the involvement of Corbyn, the still
  totemic (to some) former Labour leader, and Sultana, an effective and savvy
  digital communicator. But, say political insiders, history shows how parties’
  fortunes can be shaped by the names they adopt, both good and bad. For every
  En Marche! (Forward!), the French centrist movement that propelled Emmanuel
  Macron to his country’s presidency, there is a Canadian Conservative Reform
  Alliance party, launched in 2000 and inevitably known as CCRAP until its name
  was hastily re-jumbled. Or take the short-lived alliance of disaffected
  centrist Labour MPs and Tories that in 2019 called itself the Independent
  Group, then TIG, then Change UK before being forced by a branding dispute to
  settle on the Independent Group for Change. With even their own candidates
  dismissing their “terrible name”, they made little electoral impact and
  quickly folded. On the other hand, the body once known as the Brexit party now
  claims 29% opinion poll support, after rebranding in 2020 as Reform UK. In the
  party-naming fashion stakes, indeed, long strings of descriptors are out of
  vogue these days, while dynamic slogans or abstract verbs (Forza Italia!
  Propel! Aspire!) are very much in. “I think what you call yourself is really
  important, it’s one of the most profound calling cards of what you offer,”
  says Rohan McWilliam, a professor of modern history at Anglia Ruskin
  University and director of its Labour History Research Unit. He cites the
  example of Tony Blair’s mid-90s rebrand of “New” Labour, which he says the
  defeated Conservative party came to see as the single most important reason
  for the party’s huge victory in 1997. “Their conclusion was they had been
  defeated because Labour used one word and one word alone, and that was ‘New’.
  Just that word alone spoke volumes.” John McTernan, formerly a member of
  Blair’s core Downing Street team and now a political strategist, agrees about
  the name’s impact. “The important thing was that calling yourself New Labour
  created a category called old Labour. It created what you were against – and
  that’s a very important thing in politics. That gave us the ability to have a
  clean break with the past, so we could say: ‘No, no, that’s old Labour.’” The
  Liberal Democrats had been through their own naming dilemmas almost a decade
  earlier, when the merger of the Liberal and Social Democratic parties in 1988
  prompted a heated debate that was also settled by a vote by party members. “At
  one period, election materials from us were appearing with Liberal Alliance,
  Social and Liberal Democrats and Liberal Democrats, all on different posters
  within a very short period of time,” says the Lib Dem peer and former
  communications director Olly Grender. “It was very vexed at the time.”
  Ultimately, however, “Liberal Democrats feels a very comfortable fit,” she
  says. “Liberalism is the absolute bedrock of our history and firmly underpins
  our current beliefs.” So where should Corbyn and Sultana land? Gareth Morgan,
  an executive director overseeing government relations at the brand consultancy
  Cavendish, urges clarity above all. “I think it’s always useful to have a name
  which conveys the purpose to people who check in with politics for 10 minutes
  each week, max. The best name is one where, just by reading it, I understand
  what you’re for and what you’re about.” Chris Bruni-Lowe, a campaigns
  strategist whose book Eight Words That Changed the World examines which
  political words resonate, says: “A party name or slogan should be emotionally
  intelligible to everyday people, not just to political insiders. Words that
  sound elitist or academic are the least likely to work. New political parties
  often fail unless they define themselves clearly and simply.” Bruni-Lowe has
  advised parties across the political spectrum. “The most successful parties
  have a name and slogan that succeeded because it was immediately clear what it
  stood for,” he says. Over to you, Corbyn, Sultana – and your many thousands of
  supporters. • This article was amended on 3 August 2025. The Canadian
  Conservative Reform Alliance launched in 2000, not 2015 as an earlier version
  said.
