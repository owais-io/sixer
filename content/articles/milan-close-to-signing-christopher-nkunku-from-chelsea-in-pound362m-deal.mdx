  Milan are poised to sign the Chelsea forward Christopher Nkunku for a package
  worth €42m (£36.2m). The deal contains a sell-on clause for the France
  international, who has agreed personal terms with the Serie A club. Chelsea
  have revamped their attack and decided Nkunku is not part of their plans. They
  are expected to add to Enzo Maresca’s options by signing the Manchester United
  winger Alejandro Garnacho for between £35m and £40m. The impending sale of
  Nkunku for €37m plus €5m in add-ons does not directly relate to the pursuit of
  Garnacho because they play in different positions. Moving Nkunku out may
  create space for Chelsea to push for an attacking midfielder. They are
  interested in Barcelona’s Fermín López and RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Tottenham
  are considering whether to bid for the latter. Leipzig were one of the teams
  pushing for Nkunku, who left the Bundesliga side for £52m in 2023. The
  28-year-old has struggled for form and fitness at Chelsea. He picked up a knee
  injury during his first pre-season and was unable to build momentum. He had a
  bit-part role under Maresca last season, although he made contributions to
  Chelsea winning the Club World Cup this summer. Bayern Munich held talks over
  Nkunku but were interested only in a loan. Chelsea wanted a permanent sale.
  Their position is slightly different on Nicolas Jackson, who may be allowed to
  go on loan if the deal contains an obligation to buy. Bayern, Aston Villa,
  Napoli, Juventus and Newcastle are tracking the striker. Chelsea are prepared
  to wait to see how the Alexander Isak situation plays out at Newcastle before
  committing to a final decision on Jackson, who is likely to be reintegrated in
  Maresca’s squad if he stays. Roma, Leipzig and a host of English sides are
  monitoring the 19-year-old winger Tyrique George.
