  A vicious ace down the T secures the lead, and whoever loses will carry their
  no-show around for a very, very long time. You’ve got to feel for them. Felix
  rushes to 30-0, serving as he was before he had to serve out; of course, as I
  type, a double ushers De Minaur into the game and raises the intensity yet
  further. This time, though, he responds with an ace, only to swipe wide at the
  end of a long rally. At 40-30, the set remains in the balance! Felix explodes
  into a forehand to earn 30-all, then Demon errs on one of his own; a long
  return ruins break point immediately, and to deuce we go; another mistake
  gives up advantage … then a long forehand means another break! At 6-5 and
  having barely done anything, Auger-Aliassime will shortly serve for set three!
  I can’t believe how badly De Minaur is playing. De Minaur makes 30-40 so here
  comes the biggest point of the match so far … and Felix goes long on the
  forehand yet again! Again, neither man can play well enough for long enough to
  take command, the occasion and opportunity messing with their minds. We’re
  back level at 1-1 5-5. I can’t remember the last time I saw Demon, normally so
  solid, make so many errors. Before the match, he was talking about how great
  he felt and I guess knowing that, and knowing he’s got a match he expects to
  win to make his first grand slam semi, takes away all excuses for failure. If
  he loses, it’s his fault – a heavy burden to carry, all the more so when
  you’ve no idea if such opportunity will present itself again. Meantime, a fine
  volley from Felix makes 30-all, and he’s two points away from 2-1. At 30-all,
  a better point for Demon, in to the net to put away a deft volley. From there,
  he closes out, forcing Felix to serve for the set at 5-4 and upping the
  pressure to level minging. A huge and straightforward hold for
  Auger-Aliassime, who leads 5-3 in the third and is a hold away from going up
  2-1. If he can see that out, he’s a big favourite to go on, because his serve
  should get him at least one breaker, while Demon is still struggling to land
  his first delivery. At 40-15, another booming forehand down the line gives
  Felix a sniff, and he might just be growing into this; he’s certainly the
  better player for the now, but given the chance to hit another telling ball,
  he picks the wrong side, picking out De Minaur, who blocks it back for a
  winner and 1-1 3-4. The inability of either man to rise to the occasion does
  not bode well for their chances in a semi against Sinner, though I guess in
  that situation, the pressure might relax and both would be expected to lose
  heavily. Because that’s where we are in men’s tennis now: Sinner and Alcaraz
  look too good for anyone but each other and actually, I wonder if, after over
  a decade of wild happenings, we’re getting somewhere similar in the women’s
  game with Sabalenka, Swiatek, Gauff and Osaka. We shall see. Meantime, I’d not
  be remotely surprised if De Minaur breaks back here, and shonuff Felix, down
  15-30, nails a pair of forehands before, asked to play an extra ball, he nets
  a simple volley. But have a look! A service winner saves the first break-back
  point, then a forehand down the line look out for all the world, but somehow,
  the outermost fibre of the ball tickles the outermost fibre of the line, and
  when Auger-Aliassime makes advantage, demon volleys the ball wot done it into
  the crowd, not the kind of emotion we usually see from him. Seconds later,
  another error hands over the consolidation, and that might be an important
  game in the unfolding of this contest, Felix up 1-1 4-2. Felix looks like he’s
  playing in hiking boots, which’d explain a few things, but an error from Demon
  gives him 15-40 and a first serve into the net burnishes a glittering
  opportunity. And De Minaur compounds the problem by delivering wide!
  Auger-Aliassime has the break and leads 3-2 in the third! Demon tries to get
  himself going, collaring a forehand down the line for 30-all and hollering
  encouragement to himself. For all the good it does him: From there, Felix
  serves out, securing the hold with an ace, and this is still so tight at 1-1
  2-2. A swift half hold apiece and De Minaur leads 2-1 in the third, doing so
  to love for the first time since the second game of the match. This match is
  there for whichever player can forget the gravity of the situation to play
  their natural game. I guess both players are fully aware of the magnitude of
  this contest in the context of their careers; I’m not surprised they’re
  nervous, assuming that’s the main reason for the drop in level following their
  fourth-round matches. That second set was, by the way, the longest of the
  championships so far, and Demon will, I’m sure, still be carrying the second
  serve he failed to punish when up break point at 5-5. Anyhow, he holds easily
  for 1-1 1-0, and that’s a bit more like it from him. The quality hasn’t been
  great, but the compulsion is high level. I’ve not a clue who’s going to win
  this, but whoever it is, if they face Jannik Sinner in the last four and play
  in similar style to today, they’re getting chewed up. Now then. Felix sends a
  return close to the line and Demon struggles to get behind it, off balance
  when he hits a forehand and here comes the first set point of the breaker on
  serve, Auger-Aliassime with it … and De Minaur nets! Somehow, from a break
  down and after saving set point, Felix levels us up at 1-1! He’s playing
  poorly, but in a way that’ll now encourage him because he’ll know that if he
  hits a better level, the semis are there for him. De Minaur unloads a fine
  return to the backhand corner but this time, he can’t follow it up, straying
  long, and at 6-7 he must now serve at set-point down; a return falls long, and
  we’re back level. De Minaur hands back the mini-break but is quickly presented
  with a fresh one, Auger-Aliassime botching yet another forehand for 4-5. But
  sometimes, poor play is contagious, and we wind up at 5-5 thanks to another
  error from the Aussie. But he partially redeems himself by again sticking in a
  rally with absurd de-fence; he now has set point at 6-5, saved with a 125mph
  ace down the T; 6-6 it is Auger-Aliassime nabs an immediate mini-break, then
  returns it via double. He just can’t play well enough for long enough to get
  anywhere, and at 2-2 it’s beginning to look like De Minaur will eventually
  prevail, one way or the other … and, as I type, he again get back into a point
  via dug-out lob, Felix nets, and at 3-2, it’s Demon with the mini-break,
  quickly consolidated into 4-2. Demon has, we’re told, hit 87 first serves and
  53 second, quite a total when you consider we’re still in set two. But as we
  said at the top, Felix is not much of a returner, a hold to 15 securing a
  second-set breaker; it goes without saying that he has to win this, but as we
  know, things that go without saying are still generally said. Is that phrase a
  contradiction in terms? An oxymoron? Or maybe tautology? Aaaarrrrgggghhh!
  Consecutive errors from Felix turn 30-15 into 30-40, and these are big points
  coming up. If De Minaur breaks here, it’ll be hard to see him losing, but a
  return into the net – when delivered a weak second serve – takes us to deuce.
  That was a proper chance, and from there, two big serves, the second an ace,
  restore Auger-Aliassime’s second-set advantage at 4-6 6-5. Another missed
  first serve, another missed return; Felix can’t say he’s not had chances, and
  a forehand sent unnecessarily into the net means it’s soon 30-0 … then 40-0.
  But at 40-15, De Minaur nets a backhand, missed another first serve, and as
  the rally progresses, Auger-Aliassime strokes a backhand winner down the line
  to make deuce. He’s two points away from the set, but two unforced errors –
  two more unforced errors – donate the hold, and Demon leads 6-4 5-5. Felix
  rushes to 40-15 but a double offers Demon a sniff; a body-serve, though, is
  returned into the net and at 6-4 4-5, the Aussie will shortly serve to stay in
  an engaging bju low-quality set two. De Minaur has dropped, two unforced
  errors handing over 30-all. But he knows enough to finagle a hold, now leading
  6-4 4-4, and the standard here is less than stellar. Felix broke back in
  double-quick time and holds in similar fashion; just as he looked to be
  fading, he’s found a way back in, attacking but with more control, and this
  next De Minaur service-game is a biggun. Maybe this’ll get him going:
  Auger-Aliassime sends a flat forehand spinning cross-court for a sensational
  winner and 15-all and is he finally going after the multitude of second serves
  he’s facing? You bet he is, a weak second serve given the treatment at 15-40,
  allowing another forehand winner to secure the break-back. De Minaur leads 6-4
  3-3, but might we be watching momentum switch? Felix is caught between two
  stools: he’s not hitting consistently enough to unleash, but if he’s
  tentative, as he was at the end of that last game, he’ll lose. It won’t be
  surprising if, in the disappointment of putting in all that effort to not
  break, he’s broken himself and, as I type, a leaping volley from close to the
  net arranges Demon 15-40. He can’t take the first opportunity, but snaffles
  the second, and at 6-4 3-2, he leads by a set and a break. This match is
  disappearing, fast. This is a massive game for Felix, who’s burned two break
  point in it, and when De Minaur wrongfoots him with a backhand, coaxed down
  the line, it’s over. The Aussie leads 6-4 2-2. Now then. Felix unloads on a
  forehand and it earns him 0-30 … at which point a powercut intervenes, my
  picture returning to see Demon still serving but up advantage. Comms lets me
  know he’s still trying to hit service-winners and Auger-Aliassime groundstroke
  winners, neither especially successfully, and a netted forehand takes us back
  to deuce, for the eighth time in the game. Oh my goodness! Demon races in for
  a volley, is lobbed, and somehow responds with a lob of his own … that’s also
  a tweener! That is absolutely ridiculous behavioiur. Felix tries to get it
  back in similar style but can’t, and 15-all soon becomes 15-30, but from
  there, he finds what he needs to hold for 4-6 2-1. De Minaur, though, is now
  the better player. A gorgeous drop makes 0-15 then, at 40-30, a rare unforced
  error from De Minaur, a backhand into the net, takes us to deuce. So Felix
  unleashes a terrifying forehand … only for Demon to stick in the point, switch
  momentum, and incite an error borne of frustration. Seconds later, the hold is
  secured for 6-4 1-1. The problem Felix has is that he doesn’t want to go for
  too much, but he also doesn’t want to get bogged down in long, sapping rallies
  against someone more suited to them. Thing is, he has enough power to dictate
  without going mad with it, he just needs to pull back a little, either with
  power or with seeking lines … and, as I type, he finds himself a break-point
  down … making deuce with a big serve. A second-serve ace out wide then earns
  advantage … but another error restores deuce and from there he secures an
  important hold. Though De Minaur leads 6-4 0-1, the sense is that the game is
  on Auger-Aliassime’s racket: if his hitting works, he wins, and if it doesn’t,
  he doesn’t. A really poor miss from Felix, on the backhand with loads of space
  to hit, hands over advantage and a second set point, then an overhit forehand
  confirms it. Despite not landing a single first serve in the game, De Minaur
  leads 6-4, and Felix will be raging at his inability to profit. It does not
  augur-aliassime well. Felix makes 15-0 but a big forehand to the backhand
  corner – exactly the kind of shot Demon is looking to play – levels the game.
  But he’s struggling a bit on first serve now, forced to rely on his fabled
  retrieval skills when a booming forehand takes control of the rally, before
  cleverly switching momentum and forcing the error; 30-15. But another big
  forehand from Auger-Aliassime is good enough to win the next point and we wind
  up at 5-4 deuce; this is developing into an absorbing struggle. Two aces in
  the game as Felix makes 40-15, but a leaping animal of a forehand gives Demon
  a sniff … before the hold is secured. After a sit-down, the Aussie will serve
  for the first set at 5-4. De Minaur does enough, securing a huge hold for 5-3
  in the first. Felix needs to pull back on his forehand just a little, his
  opponent’s ability to retrieve inciting him to go for a little too much. Down
  0-15, an ace down the T levels the game, then Felix comes in and somehow,
  Demon hooks a forehand past him – I think he leaves it – and it sails inside
  the line. A double, though, restores parity at 30-all, then a backhand swiped
  wide donates break-back point; already it looks like these two are
  exceptionally well matched. And though De Minaur saves advantage, he’s soon
  facing another, a long rally develops, Felix in charge, but the second he
  drops a ball short it’s punished back at him and so it’s to deuce once more.
  The first is seized back via ace, the second almost so. But a fault is called
  then, during a longer rally, Auger-Aliassime running around his backhand on
  every shot, he eventually goes long and De Minaur has the break, up 4-3 in the
  first set. For anyone wondering why this isn’t being done in the game-by-game
  format, it’s because we’ve got two matches and potentially – hopefully – eight
  hours of action. So to save my sanity, we’re doing it this way and, as I type,
  Felix pushes a forehand wide to give De Minaur 0-30 and the first glimmer of
  an opportunity. Which he forces home with a really good backhand down the
  line, raising three break points in the process… Two more straightforward
  holds; Felix, who leads 3-2 is serving beautifully. But can he make an
  impression on De Minaur’s delivery? The Demon has worked hard to put on a bit
  more muscle, so there’s more on his balls now, but he’s working with weaker
  raw materials than pretty much everyone in the elite, which is why he’s never
  gone beyond the last eight of a major. As we said at the top, this is a huge
  opportunity for him, because Felix is an opponent he’ll fancy himself to beat,
  whereas Zverev is in that tier of players he rarely beats. Now an easy hold
  for Demon, and though it’s possible one of these takes three tight sets, the
  sense is that we’re settling in for a good few hours. Let’s hope so: we’ve had
  too many one-sided matches these last 10 days and we’re due a classic. That
  said, I really enjoyed the beating Osaka put on Gauff, with Muchova v Kostyuk
  probably my most enjoyed match so far. Meantime, Felix nails an ace for 40-30,
  then spanks a forehand into the corner. But De Minaur hoists a moon-ball of a
  lob and the overhead goes into the net; at 1-1 deuce, here comes pressure …
  quickly alleviated with a monstrous serve and follow-up overhead. That’s a
  really good sign, given what happened in the previous point, and when the
  Demon nets, he leads 2-1 in the first, on serve. Auger-Aliassime holds to 15,
  looking pretty good while doing it. He’s into the match and looks good and
  businesslike. And for extra points, he’s got Daffy Duck on his shirt. Daffy
  Duck, what a legend. I can’t say I don’t enjoy Bugs’ smarm and smartarsery, I
  do, but ultimately Daffy is my boy. And off we go. And out they come. Both our
  players are engaged, soon to be married. Mazal tov, boys. I guess we might
  look at Felix and say yeah, but Zverev hasn’t been the same since his Aussie
  Open final undressing, just as Rublev is on the way down too. And we’d be
  right to: perspective is important. However he’s taken both apart and is
  talking like someone who’s ready; who knows his time is now. Oh Demon! Ohhhh
  maaaaaate! Someone chuck that man a lifebelt, he’s drowning. I really like
  that Sky have, finally, started giving us proper analysis; Ryan Harrison is a
  terrific addition to the team. Currently, he’s showing us Anisimova’s footwork
  off the return, a little hop to the left opening both sides of the court. She
  was superb in outclassing Bia Haddad Maia last round and I really fancy her to
  make if difficult for Swiatek on hard, and really respect the way she’s come
  back after Wimbledon when she might’ve felt sorry for herself after folding so
  publicly. If she plays close to her best today, I think she wins … but Swiatek
  has the skill to ensure she doesn’t. I strongly fancy Felix in our first
  match, on the basis that if he plays well, he’ll have too much for De Minaur,
  who has a higher bottom level but a lower top level. It’s a form thing really
  – Auger-Aliassime has played three great matches in a row and is in the nock
  of his life. He’ll be made to play a lot of balls, but has the ability to
  explode with winners, which the Demon does not. Yes yes ya’ll and welcome to
  the US Open 2025 – day 11! Some years ago now, a tennis coach mate messaged me
  excitedly, telling me he’d seen the future: a kid with power and grace who
  moved more beautifully than anyone he’d seen before. Amazingly, so good was he
  at 16 that the only relevant comparators were Boris Becker and Rafael Nadal.
  That kid was Felix Auger-Aliassime and, it’s fair to say, he hasn’t quite
  progressed as expected. Of course he had weaknesses back then, most
  particularly his second serve, his return and his volleying, but even when
  granted the gift of a Covid hiatus to get them sorted, they stayed pretty much
  the same as they always were. Now, at 25, the sense is that he is what he is:
  a bloody good player who’ll never be grand slam champion – whatever his
  natural gifts insist he’s capable of. And yet, and yet, and yet. In the last
  two rounds, he’s accounted for Alexander Zverev and Andrey Rublev for the loss
  of just one set, playing close to as well as he can, and in Alex de Minaur
  finds an eminently beatable last-eight opponent, able to scurry and retrieve
  as well as anyone on tour, but lacking the weapons to dominate. For both men,
  this is a moment, a major quarter-final against the other the kind chance that
  may never come round again. Following them on to court is a redemption battle
  of epic proportions. When Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova met in the
  Wimbledon final, the result was a historic 6-0 6-0 humiliation that will haunt
  the American until the day she does and perhaps beyond. She fought for years,
  making all the usual sacrifices sportsfolk do, was brave enough to take a
  mental health break, then returned, realised a dream, and stood powerless as
  it was mercilessly devastated in front of the world. On a hard court, though,
  she’ll fancy her chances of hitting at the top of the bounce, her casual power
  enough to disquiet anyone – even Swiatek who, though she’s rediscovered
  herself in recent months, is not far removed from a major downturn in form and
  confidence. The Wimbledon champ is the favourite, but Anisimova has everything
  required to get after her in what should be an absolutely banging contest.

De Minaur has dropped, two unforced errors handing over 30-all. But he knows enough to finagle a hold, now leading 6-4 4-4, and the standard here is less than stellar. Felix broke back in double-quick time and holds in similar fashion; just as he looked to be fading, he’s found a way back in, attacking but with more control, and this next De Minaur service-game is a biggun. Maybe this’ll get him going: Auger-Aliassime sends a flat forehand spinning cross-court for a sensational winner and 15-all and is he finally going after the multitude of second serves he’s facing? You bet he is, a weak second serve given the treatment at 15-40, allowing another forehand winner to secure the break-back. De Minaur leads 6-4 3-3, but might we be watching momentum switch? Felix is caught between two stools: he’s not hitting consistently enough to unleash, but if he’s tentative, as he was at the end of that last game, he’ll lose. It won’t be surprising if, in the disappointment of putting in all that effort to not break, he’s broken himself and, as I type, a leaping volley from close to the net arranges Demon 15-40. He can’t take the first opportunity, but snaffles the second, and at 6-4 3-2, he leads by a set and a break. This match is disappearing, fast. This is a massive game for Felix, who’s burned two break point in it, and when De Minaur wrongfoots him with a backhand, coaxed down the line, it’s over. The Aussie leads 6-4 2-2. Now then. Felix unloads on a forehand and it earns him 0-30 … at which point a powercut intervenes, my picture returning to see Demon still serving but up advantage. Comms lets me know he’s still trying to hit service-winners and Auger-Aliassime groundstroke winners, neither especially successfully, and a netted forehand takes us back to deuce, for the eighth time in the game. Oh my goodness! Demon races in for a volley, is lobbed, and somehow responds with a lob of his own … that’s also a tweener! That is absolutely ridiculous behavioiur. Felix tries to get it back in similar style but can’t, and 15-all soon becomes 15-30, but from there, he finds what he needs to hold for 4-6 2-1. De Minaur, though, is now the better player. A gorgeous drop makes 0-15 then, at 40-30, a rare unforced error from De Minaur, a backhand into the net, takes us to deuce. So Felix unleashes a terrifying forehand … only for Demon to stick in the point, switch momentum, and incite an error borne of frustration. Seconds later, the hold is secured for 6-4 1-1. The problem Felix has is that he doesn’t want to go for too much, but he also doesn’t want to get bogged down in long, sapping rallies against someone more suited to them. Thing is, he has enough power to dictate without going mad with it, he just needs to pull back a little, either with power or with seeking lines … and, as I type, he finds himself a break-point down … making deuce with a big serve. A second-serve ace out wide then earns advantage … but another error restores deuce and from there he secures an important hold. Though De Minaur leads 6-4 0-1, the sense is that the game is on Auger-Aliassime’s racket: if his hitting works, he wins, and if it doesn’t, he doesn’t. A really poor miss from Felix, on the backhand with loads of space to hit, hands over advantage and a second set point, then an overhit forehand confirms it. Despite not landing a single first serve in the game, De Minaur leads 6-4, and Felix will be raging at his inability to profit. It does not augur-aliassime well. Felix makes 15-0 but a big forehand to the backhand corner – exactly the kind of shot Demon is looking to play – levels the game. But he’s struggling a bit on first serve now, forced to rely on his fabled retrieval skills when a booming forehand takes control of the rally, before cleverly switching momentum and forcing the error; 30-15. But another big forehand from Auger-Aliassime is good enough to win the next point and we wind up at 5-4 deuce; this is developing into an absorbing struggle. Two aces in the game as Felix makes 40-15, but a leaping animal of a forehand gives Demon a sniff … before the hold is secured. After a sit-down, the Aussie will serve for the first set at 5-4. De Minaur does enough, securing a huge hold for 5-3 in the first. Felix needs to pull back on his forehand just a little, his opponent’s ability to retrieve inciting him to go for a little too much. Down 0-15, an ace down the T levels the game, then Felix comes in and somehow, Demon hooks a forehand past him – I think he leaves it – and it sails inside the line. A double, though, restores parity at 30-all, then a backhand swiped wide donates break-back point; already it looks like these two are exceptionally well matched. And though De Minaur saves advantage, he’s soon facing another, a long rally develops, Felix in charge, but the second he drops a ball short it’s punished back at him and so it’s to deuce once more. The first is seized back via ace, the second almost so. But a fault is called then, during a longer rally, Auger-Aliassime running around his backhand on every shot, he eventually goes long and De Minaur has the break, up 4-3 in the first set. For anyone wondering why this isn’t being done in the game-by-game format, it’s because we’ve got two matches and potentially – hopefully – eight hours of action. So to save my sanity, we’re doing it this way and, as I type, Felix pushes a forehand wide to give De Minaur 0-30 and the first glimmer of an opportunity. Which he forces home with a really good backhand down the line, raising three break points in the process… Two more straightforward holds; Felix, who leads 3-2 is serving beautifully. But can he make an impression on De Minaur’s delivery? The Demon has worked hard to put on a bit more muscle, so there’s more on his balls now, but he’s working with weaker raw materials than pretty much everyone in the elite, which is why he’s never gone beyond the last eight of a major. As we said at the top, this is a huge opportunity for him, because Felix is an opponent he’ll fancy himself to beat, whereas Zverev is in that tier of players he rarely beats. Now an easy hold for Demon, and though it’s possible one of these takes three tight sets, the sense is that we’re settling in for a good few hours. Let’s hope so: we’ve had too many one-sided matches these last 10 days and we’re due a classic. That said, I really enjoyed the beating Osaka put on Gauff, with Muchova v Kostyuk probably my most enjoyed match so far. Meantime, Felix nails an ace for 40-30, then spanks a forehand into the corner. But De Minaur hoists a moon-ball of a lob and the overhead goes into the net; at 1-1 deuce, here comes pressure … quickly alleviated with a monstrous serve and follow-up overhead. That’s a really good sign, given what happened in the previous point, and when the Demon nets, he leads 2-1 in the first, on serve. Auger-Aliassime holds to 15, looking pretty good while doing it. He’s into the match and looks good and businesslike. And for extra points, he’s got Daffy Duck on his shirt. Daffy Duck, what a legend. I can’t say I don’t enjoy Bugs’ smarm and smartarsery, I do, but ultimately Daffy is my boy. And off we go. And out they come. Both our players are engaged, soon to be married. Mazal tov, boys. I guess we might look at Felix and say yeah, but Zverev hasn’t been the same since his Aussie Open final undressing, just as Rublev is on the way down too. And we’d be right to: perspective is important. However he’s taken both apart and is talking like someone who’s ready; who knows his time is now. Oh Demon! Ohhhh maaaaaate! Someone chuck that man a lifebelt, he’s drowning. I really like that Sky have, finally, started giving us proper analysis; Ryan Harrison is a terrific addition to the team. Currently, he’s showing us Anisimova’s footwork off the return, a little hop to the left opening both sides of the court. She was superb in outclassing Bia Haddad Maia last round and I really fancy her to make if difficult for Swiatek on hard, and really respect the way she’s come back after Wimbledon when she might’ve felt sorry for herself after folding so publicly. If she plays close to her best today, I think she wins … but Swiatek has the skill to ensure she doesn’t. I strongly fancy Felix in our first match, on the basis that if he plays well, he’ll have too much for De Minaur, who has a higher bottom level but a lower top level. It’s a form thing really – Auger-Aliassime has played three great matches in a row and is in the nock of his life. He’ll be made to play a lot of balls, but has the ability to explode with winners, which the Demon does not. Yes yes ya’ll and welcome to the US Open 2025 – day 11! Some years ago now, a tennis coach mate messaged me excitedly, telling me he’d seen the future: a kid with power and grace who moved more beautifully than anyone he’d seen before. Amazingly, so good was he at 16 that the only relevant comparators were Boris Becker and Rafael Nadal. That kid was Felix Auger-Aliassime and, it’s fair to say, he hasn’t quite progressed as expected. Of course he had weaknesses back then, most particularly his second serve, his return and his volleying, but even when granted the gift of a Covid hiatus to get them sorted, they stayed pretty much the same as they always were. Now, at 25, the sense is that he is what he is: a bloody good player who’ll never be grand slam champion – whatever his natural gifts insist he’s capable of. And yet, and yet, and yet. In the last two rounds, he’s accounted for Alexander Zverev and Andrey Rublev for the loss of just one set, playing close to as well as he can, and in Alex de Minaur finds an eminently beatable last-eight opponent, able to scurry and retrieve as well as anyone on tour, but lacking the weapons to dominate. For both men, this is a moment, a major quarter-final against the other the kind chance that may never come round again. Following them on to court is a redemption battle of epic proportions. When Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova met in the Wimbledon final, the result was a historic 6-0 6-0 humiliation that will haunt the American until the day she does and perhaps beyond. She fought for years, making all the usual sacrifices sportsfolk do, was brave enough to take a mental health break, then returned, realised a dream, and stood powerless as it was mercilessly devastated in front of the world. On a hard court, though, she’ll fancy her chances of hitting at the top of the bounce, her casual power enough to disquiet anyone – even Swiatek who, though she’s rediscovered herself in recent months, is not far removed from a major downturn in form and confidence. The Wimbledon champ is the favourite, but Anisimova has everything required to get after her in what should be an absolutely banging contest. Play: 11.30am local, 4.30pm BST
