  There is a scene in Alasdair Gray’s landmark novel Lanark in which the author
  himself makes an appearance. He startles the eponymous hero, one of the book’s
  twin protagonists, by explaining he is a work of fiction. It is an authorial
  intervention too brazen for Alan Bissett to ignore. In this charming and
  light-footed tribute to two towering cultural figures, the actor-playwright
  steps out of character to fill us in on what is going on. Because on the face
  of it, there is little to connect Gray, the celebrated muralist and writer,
  and Billy Connolly, the loquacious standup comedian, whom he encounters here.
  The difference is apparent in Bissett’s performance as he alternates between
  the two men. As Gray, he stands hunched, eyes screwed, hands in pockets. His
  rendition of the author’s speech patterns is not strictly accurate, but that
  might have stretched credibility: Gray, who died in 2019, spoke in an
  extraordinarily odd combination of pauses and shrill exclamations. But Bissett
  gives a flavour of his verbal flourishes and buttoned-up humour. By contrast,
  his Connolly is free-flowing and expansive. He strokes an imaginary mane of
  hair, bends extravagantly at the waist and stretches his arms wide. There is
  humour in his very body. Bissett’s interjection as himself cements the
  impression he has already been creating. He has nothing to associate the two
  men beyond a photograph of them standing side by side at the launch of Lanark
  in Glasgow’s old Third Eye Centre in 1981. Gray is focused on signing a copy
  while Connolly, eyes alert, waits patiently. It could mean everything or
  nothing at all. But what emerges, as Gray describes his life with ironic
  detachment and Connolly spins yarns before an imagined celebrity audience, is
  a story not about their almighty successes, but about their long and uncertain
  route to making their names. Had they bonded that night in Glasgow, suggests
  Bissett, it would have been over their inauspicious upbringings, their
  accidental breaks and their superhuman perseverance. If the show does not hit
  the dizzy peaks of Bissett’s Moira Trilogy, it is no less a thoughtful and
  entertaining evening in the vicarious company of two much-loved icons. • At
