  Jane Martinson’s call for the UK media to adopt a new approach to reporting
  debates over asylum and immigration is welcome (A desperate, opportunist press
  and vicious politicians: no wonder the debate on refugees is so awful, 30
  August). As a longtime advocate of such changes, and a former BBC newsreader,
  I can point to one very significant lacuna: the massive hole where
  counter‑arguments should be coming from ministers. If Keir Starmer and his
  colleagues a) spoke about the importance of immigration to Britain’s economic
  and social wellbeing; b) pointed out that we actually receive and resettle
  fewer asylum seekers than peer countries such as Germany and France; c)
  praised the efforts of communities that welcome and integrate newcomers; and
  d) highlighted some of the success stories of immigrants or asylum seekers,
  media outlets such as the BBC would be obliged to cover it. Instead, they
  uphold a long and ignoble tradition of keeping stumm on the assumption that,
  if unaddressed, the issue will lose salience. This has the disadvantage of
  allowing toxic and fact-averse notions of “Britishness” to remain
  unchallenged, ready to be activated as sleeper frames by troublemakers such as
  Nigel Farage and his acolytes, who now have the story effectively to
  themselves. Moreover, it’s obvious that this quietism no longer works. Jake
