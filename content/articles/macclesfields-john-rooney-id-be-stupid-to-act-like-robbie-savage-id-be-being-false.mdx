  being false’

  Macclesfield FC have grown accustomed to being the most famous team with the
  most famous names in their league. In a previous life, the club listed Sammy
  McIlroy, Paul Ince and Sol Campbell as former managers. Since their rebirth in
  2020, the former Premier League players Neil Danns, Alex Bruce and, most
  notably, Robbie Savage, have enjoyed spells in the hot seat. John Rooney’s
  surname is unlikely to go unnoticed. Yet the younger brother of the England
  and Manchester United legend Wayne is, by his own admission, a far less glitzy
  appointment than his predecessor Savage, whose effervescent character came to
  define Macclesfield in recent years. A self-styled Marmite man, Savage enjoyed
  unparalleled success in his season-long stint at Macclesfield, winning the
  Northern Premier League with a mammoth 109 points. His departure to Forest
  Green this summer left a void, with key players such as Laurent Mendy, Tre
  Pemberton and Neil Kengni following him to Gloucestershire. Pictures of Savage
  still adorn the walls behind Rooney as we chat in the boardroom of the
  Leasing.com Stadium, days out from Macclesfield’s opening game of the new
  National League North campaign against Worksop Town. “I’ll be different to
  Sav,” says Rooney, an attacking midfielder who rejoined Macclesfield as a
  player in August 2023 following stints at clubs such as New York Red Bulls,
  Orlando City, Barrow and Oldham before announcing his retirement at the end of
  last season. “He has always been out there as a player and a pundit. He likes
  attention – not in a bad sense. I’ll go under the radar and be my own person.
  I’d be stupid to act like Sav, because I’m a different person and I’d be being
  false.” There’s no doubt Savage’s exit has been seismic, but it took just days
  for Macclesfield to replace him with Rooney. Plans had already been in place
  for the 34-year-old to take up a coaching role if a vacancy arose. “It
  happened so quick with Sav going, so we didn’t have time to sit back and think
  about it,” Rooney says. “Rob [Smethurst, the club’s owner] told me on the
  Monday and we were training on the Tuesday.” Rooney had little hesitation
  accepting the role and there was even a word of advice from his brother, whose
  own tumultuous managerial journey in the past few years may provide a lesson
  for John. “When I got the job, [Wayne] said: ‘Just try and enjoy it.’
  Obviously he went into management and did well at some places, not so well at
  other places. And listen, that’s football. It’s part of management. You’re not
  going to get your own way all the time.” “When do these opportunities come up
  to be a manager of a club like this? Not often,” Rooney adds. “It might not
  come again. So once I got wind of it, I wanted to take it with both hands. You
  could be falling out of the game as a player, then you’re scratching around to
  come back in as a coach. I spoke about it last year with Sav, that if he ever
  left, would I be interested? I always said I’d want to throw myself right at
  it.” Rooney, whose playing days began in the Everton academy like his brother,
  made his professional debut with Macclesfield in 2008. He’s now a novice
  manager but with experience by his side to call upon. Macclesfield have just
  appointed Francis Jeffers, another ex-Everton player, as Rooney’s assistant.
  “I’ve known Franny for a long time. I played under him as a coach at Oldham.
  He’s coached at Ipswich, out in Saudi. I wanted someone older than me who
  would challenge me, not just agree with everything I say. I’d be naive
  otherwise.” Rooney laughs off the idea of offering a job to a certain other
  former Everton striker. He’s keen to be his own man. It’s put to Rooney that
  he is still registered as a player for the coming season, so could mirror the
  player-manager role in which Wayne thrived at Derby early in his own
  managerial career. “Touch wood I’m not needed,” he replies. “It’s been a
  pretty smooth transition to managing. It’s now my third spell here; two as a
  player and now as manager. Everyone knows what this club means to me. I
  started here, they gave me my chance in professional football and I’ll never
  forget that.” Rooney takes the reins at an intriguing stage in the Silkmen’s
  journey. They have blazed a trail through the divisions, with three promotions
  in four years, and now face their most challenging task in the National League
  North. “It’s going to be a lot tougher than last year,” accepts Rooney, with a
  nod to the fellow phoenix clubs Hereford, Chester and Darlington who are on
  this season’s fixture list. “Come December, January, away from home, the
  pitches won’t be great, it’s about being adaptable. “Last year we got on that
  winning streak and winning is a habit. We need to roll that on to this season.
  There are some big teams in this league, five or six clubs that are full time
  and that’s our goal as well, we want to get to the full-time stage.” Will
  Macclesfield hit a glass ceiling at some point soon? Rooney will not
  countenance the idea. “We want to finish as high as possible. Our plan is to
  carry on.”
