  Nuts make wonderful milks, and therefore they also make great granitas,
  sorbets and lollies. There is no trick or trouble to getting them right, but
  there is a magic about nut ices that is as jaw-dropping as a magician’s act –
  delicious and sophisticated, without adulterating the childlike joy that
  underpins every sort of ice-cream. Then, I like to celebrate rhubarb as a
  sorbet, which is great on its own, or with cold custard, or to accompany
  stodgier puddings. Walnut and pear lollies (pictured top) This can be adapted
  for any nuts – it works particularly well with pecans (lightly roasted before
  making the milk, and consider using maple syrup in place of the sugar),
  hazelnuts (roasted before making the milk), almonds (roasted or raw, skin on
  or skin off) or pistachios (skinless, if you can get them, roasted or raw).
  You can get inventive and seasonal with the fruit, too, but it is really only
  necessary to add a sweet dimension to walnuts – other nuts can fly solo. Prep
  5 min Cook 1 hr 10 min Freeze 6 hr+ Makes about 6 x 100ml lollies 220g walnut
  halves or pieces 100g white sugar 1 ripe pear First make a nut milk: put 140g
  of the walnuts in a blender with 350ml cold water, then blend , until they’re
  a very fine texture, which will take several minutes. Strain the nut water
  through a very fine sieve, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract the
  last bits of goodness. Measure out 450ml of the nut milk (if you don’t have
  quite enough, top up with more water), then add the sugar and stir until it
  dissolves. Roast the remaining 80g walnuts very gently in a 160C (140C
  fan)/325F/gas 3 oven for 45 minutes to an hour, until light golden brown, then
  remove and leave to cool. To make the lollies, divide the roast walnuts evenly
  between six lolly moulds. Peel, core and dice the pear, then divide this
  between the lolly moulds, too. Top with the sweet walnut milk to come 5mm
  below the rim, then put on the lid and lolly sticks, and freeze for about six
  hours, until solid. Rhubarb sorbet Rhubarb is such a camp monstrosity of a
  petiole. I always think a bunch of the glorious, pink ribbed stems look like
  candles destined for a drag queen’s dressing table, or Brighton rock being
  pulled to perfection. Prep 5 min Cook 10 min, plus churning Freeze 30 min
  Makes About 1 litre 650g rhubarb 200g caster sugar 50g light runny honey, or
  glucose syrup Chop the rhubarb into 1-2cm pieces, then put in a saucepan with
  all the other ingredients and 100ml cold water. Bring to a simmer, then cook
  for five minutes, until the rhubarb is tender with just a little crunch (it
  will keep cooking as it cools). Leave to cool to room temperature, then blend
  finely. Churn the mixture in an ice-cream machine according to the maker’s
  instructions until fully firm, then put into a suitable container, seal and
  put in the freezer for half an hour or so, to firm up. If it has been stored
  in the freezer for longer and is too firm, put it in the fridge to soften
  until scoopable. Jacob Kenedy is chef and owner of Gelupo, Bocca di Lupo and
  Plaquemine Lock, all in London
