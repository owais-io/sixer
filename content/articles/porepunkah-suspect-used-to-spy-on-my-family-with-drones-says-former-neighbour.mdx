  A former neighbour of the suspected Porepunkah gunman said he used to hunt for
  deer nearby, had an intimate knowledge of Mount Buffalo and used to spy on
  her, including with drones. Loretta Quinn lived next to Dezi Freeman in
  Myrtleford, on the opposite side of Mount Buffalo to the site of the fatal
  shooting, between 2017 and 2019. She told Guardian Australia that Freeman used
  her block to access the Mount Buffalo national park, which he had done
  frequently without issue when her property was vacant. Quinn said that while
  she initially allowed Freeman to continue using her land for accessing the
  park, the relationship became acrimonious because of how often he traversed
  the property. “He really put our nose out of joint...he was walking through
  all the time constantly,” she said. “It got to the point where I’d turn around
  and he would be standing there filming me. “He had a drone that would come
  across, too, and he set up a little plastic cover, on the corner of the
  property, like a chicken coop and he would standing there spying on you too,
  looking who was coming and going.” She told Freeman he could no longer use the
  property, sparking a conflict between the neighbours that lasted until, she
  said, Freeman’s landlord forced him and his family to leave. Quinn said she
  took out an intervention order against Freeman in mid-2019, a claim supported
  by court records seen by Guardian Australia. The court records show Freeman
  was charged with breaching a personal safety intervention order in Myrtleford
  on 21 June 2019, but the charge was later withdrawn. The court records do not
  state who the order related to, but Quinn said Freeman had been charged with
  breaching the order she had taken out against him at that time. One of the
  encounters her family had with Freeman on the property was captured on her
  son’s mobile phone, and posted to social media by Quinn’s daughter after the
  shooting this week. In it, Freeman, wearing what appears to be a camera
  strapped to his chest, but also using a mobile phone to film, claims he is not
  trespassing. Quinn said she knew Freeman used guns to hunt deer with his wife,
  and had seen them hang the carcasses on a veranda at the back of the property,
  but had never seen him carrying a firearm. To hunt, he went where he always
  went: into the national park, which Quinn said he knew exceptionally well
  given he didn’t work, and lived off the land to eat. “It’s full bush, you
  can’t walk through it once you’re in,” she said. “There’s a track you can ride
  on, with horses, but that’s it. “He knows it, but it’s full on.” Quinn said
  Freeman would be familiar with the location of mines or caves that could
  provide shelter. “There’s caves everywhere, and mines everywhere, from when
  they used to gold mine. He would have it all set up. “He really knows that
  country well, they’re not exaggerating.” Quinn is uneasy, sitting locked
  inside the large barn-style shed she lives in, desperately hoping her old
  neighbour doesn’t pay a visit. “Hopefully they catch him soon.”
