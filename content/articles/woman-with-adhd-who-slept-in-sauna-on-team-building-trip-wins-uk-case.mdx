  An executive with ADHD who was sacked after spending the night sleeping in a
  sauna when she lost her room keys during a team-building event has won a
  disability discrimination case. Shannon Burns had been drinking and her bosses
  told her that confidence in her had been eroded and she needed to set an
  example. But she won her case after arguing the software company she worked
  for had not done enough to help her perform well taking into account her
  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She is in line for compensation
  after the tribunal accepted that while she had been drinking before going to
  sleep in the sauna, her ADHD contributed to her lack of organisation and the
  loss of her keys. The tribunal in Birmingham heard that Burns previously
  worked in Silicon Valley and was a member of organisations that help women
  into the tech industry. But her ADHD meant she was forgetful and often lost
  her phone and keys. She was recruited by the company Gitpod as a
  vice-president of engineering on a salary of £220,000 with £78,000 bonus per
  annum. Shortly after arriving, Burns asked Gitpod for a coach to help her with
  ADHD as she was feeling “deeply overwhelmed” at her workload but was not
  referred to occupational therapy, the tribunal heard. She attended a Gitpod
  off-site team building event in Austria and on the final night, was said to be
  “slurring her words” after drinking alcohol, the tribunal heard. Burns went
  back to her room and found it was locked and she had no key. There was no
  receptionist on duty and her roommate had fallen asleep and was not answering
  her phone. Eventually Burns gave up and went to sleep in the sauna. She later
  received a message from a senior executive saying she had to stay in control
  and was given a deadline for improvement but was dismissed two months after
  the sauna incident. The tribunal said her employer should have done more to
  investigate and assess her ADHD. On the reasons for her spending the night in
  the sauna, the tribunal concluded: “This was likely in part to be as a result
  of the combination of her alcohol consumption and her forgetfulness, which is
  a something arising from her ADHD.” A hearing will be set to decide on the
  amount of compensation Burns will receive.
