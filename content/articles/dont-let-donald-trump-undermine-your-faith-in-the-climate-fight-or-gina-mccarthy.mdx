  Over the past decade, the United States has turned technologies into tools
  that strengthened our economy, delivered good-paying union jobs, cleaned up
  our air and water, conserved our precious natural resources, and saved
  families money all across our country. Yet now the country is choosing to cede
  that leadership, letting China dominate and control the clean-energy market
  across the world. It’s no surprise that people are scratching their heads,
  wondering what happened. Our president is obsessed with fossil fuels. He wants
  to resuscitate what everyone knows is a dying coal sector while turning a
  blind eye to the health, environmental, and economic downsides of the climate
  crisis. Coupled with inconsistent threats of increased tariffs against
  virtually all our allies, he has isolated the US and amplified threats to
  global security. Donald Trump’s giant budget bill, signed right before the
  horrific floods in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico, ignores threats to
  communities from escalating climate risks while it cuts healthcare, raises
  energy costs, and puts the safety of our loved ones in harm’s way. And the
  administration’s executive orders, Environmental Protection Agency
  announcements, and efforts to gut our federal workforce make it abundantly
  clear our federal leaders are not working for the American people. But I have
  never been one to back down from a challenge, certainly not when it comes to
  protecting my kids and grandkids. And I am not alone. Millions of Americans
  across the country have no intention of letting this administration dictate
  our fate at home or abroad. We simply refuse to let this be the United States
  of America. States and institutions are still fighting in court when this
  administration disregards science and weakens federal efforts to protect
  people and our environment. Folks are still listening and speaking up at
  neighborhood gatherings, town hall meetings, and public hearings on issues
  such as the weakening of air, water and power plant pollution rules that
  increase risks to families. They are still fighting for our lives, our
  communities and our democracy. States, cities and local communities have
  authority to act boldly and work with industries to advance market innovation
  and install clean energy that creates jobs and lowers the cost of living for
  families. They still have clean vehicle fleets for cities to purchase and EV
  charging projects to pursue. They still have tax credits for solar, wind and
  batteries. There’s more than a decade of geothermal and battery storage tax
  credits available for cities, schools and health clinics, as well as many more
  clean energy opportunities we can and must grab. California, the fourth
  largest economy in the world, ran on clean energy for 219 days last year.
  Florida built more large-scale solar infrastructure than California last year.
  Even in oil country, Texas is setting records for solar, wind and battery
  capacity. More than 40 states have green banks and clean energy financing
  institutions. Twenty-four states are committed to the goals of the Paris
  climate agreement. They’re developing bilateral climate partnerships with
  countries that understand the threat of the climate crisis and the opportunity
  that clean energy provides. US leaders I have worked with for decades during
  international climate negotiations continue to work with colleagues in the
  United Nations, the European Union, India, China, development banks and the
  private sector to identify policies and strategies that allow the world to
  mobilize capital for climate projects. Why? Because the cost of not investing
  in resilience and decarbonization is far too high. Mike Bloomberg and
  Bloomberg Philanthropies have given our country a seat at the global table.
  America Is All In, partnering with the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors,
  Ceres and others, will be at the forthcoming UN climate negotiations in Brazil
  to showcase leadership on infrastructure, transportation, buildings, land use
  and more that protects our communities and cuts pollution. Mayors and
  governors will use this platform to inform negotiations, build new
  partnerships, and pursue creative financing for more projects at home, while
  US investors continue to explore opportunities to address the heartbreaking
  food and water challenges across the global south. Eighty-four per cent of
  corporations are standing by their commitments to cut carbon pollution, and
  37% are increasing their ambitions, according to PwC, because they know that
  climate solutions are good for business. The first quarter of 2025 was the
  second-strongest ever for US clean energy, representing $10bn in domestic
  investments. Across the globe, investments in clean tech are slated to reach
  $2.2tn this year, twice the amount for coal, gas and oil. To stay competitive,
  meet rising energy demand, stop utility bills from soaring, and tackle aging
  infrastructure, we need more clean energy, battery storage, and energy
  efficiency, not less. These technologies are cheaper to build and operate than
  fossil fuels. Ninety-three per cent of new electric-generating capacity this
  year is projected to come from solar, wind and batteries, according to Trump’s
  own energy department. Facts are facts. No matter how much the administration
  tries to prop up the fossil fuel industry, US states, cities, communities,
  businesses and institutions know that the world is not as Trump defines it.
  Clean energy is and must be our future. Gina McCarthy is the managing co-chair
  of America Is All In, former White House national climate adviser and 13th US
  EPA administrator
