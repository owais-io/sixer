  Martin Kettle accurately highlights the moral dilemma faced by the Royal Opera
  House in hiring the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko for the upcoming
  performances of Tosca (As Putin’s bombs fall on Ukraine, the Royal Opera House
  had a call to make about Anna Netrebko. It made the wrong one, 28 August). He
  goes on to place the ball in Netrebko’s court by suggesting she should
  withdraw from the performances or “say something unambiguous for the British
  audience in opposition to Putin’s continuing war”. He later acknowledges that
  Netrebko stated her opposition to the war at its outset and that she was
  attacked for her stance by the Russian regime. Must this happen again? As
  Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova pointed out, when speaking in a 2022 Guardian
  interview of how she was “pretty much ready to die” when she went on hunger
  strike: “If you fight with a dictator, you have to show them that you are
  ready to fight to the end.” Members of Pussy Riot were separated from their
  children and endured appalling conditions in prison. We cannot expect such
  bravery from every artist – Netrebko should not have to be an activist as well
  as a world-class singer. It is really up to the Royal Ballet and Opera to
  decide how far to go with political alignment. They certainly need to address
  the discrepancy between their obvious support for Ukraine in the last three
  years and the recent suppression of a show of support for Palestine during a
  performance. Kate Lough Southsea, Hampshire • There is an incredible double
  standard with regard to the banning of Russian artists and sportspeople.
  Israel is waging a genocidal war in Gaza (not justified by the horrific
  atrocity against Israelis that preceded it), and its violent settlers have
  been systematically driving out the original dwellers of the West Bank for
  years now. However, not only are Israeli artists not banned, but Israel
  participates in European events despite not being in Europe, such as European
  football and the Eurovision song contest. Many other countries have carried
  out unprovoked attacks on other nations – for example, the US on Iraq in 2003
  and Iran this year. Nobody has ever suggested that their artists be banned.
  Whether or not Anna Netrebko is close to Vladimir Putin, I do not see that
  ostracising her and other Russian artists is justified, unless artists from
  other countries engaging in wars of aggression are also banned, and unless all
  commercial contacts with Russia are also forbidden. Let us have the same
  standard for all. Name and address supplied • I am surprised that Martin
  Kettle puts the onus completely on the management of the Royal Opera House. It
  has to make its way financially. If enough people buy tickets to watch and
  listen to Anna Netrebko, they will put her on stage. If the public choose not
  to watch her, her feet will not be seen for dust. The onus is clearly on
  opera-goers to boycott her performance, but perhaps they have feet of clay.
  Richard McLachlan Ipswich, Suffolk • Would your writer like to give his
  opinion on the wartime National Gallery concerts of Dame Myra Hess and
  performances by others such as Eileen Joyce where they played music by Bach,
  Beethoven, Brahms and other German composers? I used to believe that the arts
  reached out to solve problems, like Ukraine, where diplomacy clearly is
  failing. Trevor Singleton Warton, Lancashire • Have an opinion on anything
