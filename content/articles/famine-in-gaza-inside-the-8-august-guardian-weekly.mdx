  Images of starving Palestinians have appeared with increasing insistency
  across the world’s media over the past few weeks. Deciding whose child and
  which picture best illustrates the territory’s slide into famine is a grim
  task. Five-year-old Lana Salih Juha, on this week’s cover, weighed just 8kg
  when this photograph was taken in Gaza City on 28 July. As Malak A Tantesh
  reports from Gaza for this week’s big story, Lana’s parents are among many
  inside the territory forced to watch children waste away as deliberate aid
  restrictions from Israel mean hunger is becoming a killer. It was, as Malak
  reports, a week when two milestones were reached: a Palestinian official
  record of 60,000 deaths and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification,
  a group of UN and aid organisations, stating that the whole population of 2.2
  people were now living in a state of famine. But, as UN food expert Michael
  Fakhri told Nina Lakhani, this desperate state had been predicted since early
  2024 when in an interview with the Guardian he warned that Israel’s policy to
  severely restrict aid deliveries would lead to what is now playing out. In the
  face of such obvious and pressing need, what does it matter that the UK has
  joined France in saying it will recognise the state of Palestine in September
  unless its conditions for ending the war have been met? A former UK ambassador
  to Israel Simon McDonald agrees that the gesture may seem futile – but it is
  also necessary. Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home address ***

  batsman than Barney Ronay? Graham Snowdon, editor I recently found this
  section on random gestures of generosity on the Guardian website and it’s been
