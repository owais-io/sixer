  After 27 years, some of TV’s most beloved characters have left our screens for
  ever. Throughout Sex and the City, Carrie Bradshaw chronicled her loves,
  infatuations, affairs, heartbreaks, friendships, high fashion, homes, work and
  more, all over a cosmopolitan or five. Throughout what would turn out to be
  the final season of its spin-off, And Just Like That, she finally ended her
  extremely on/off 20-year-relationship with country boy Aidan, a man revived
  for the series with a cruel streak and all the subtlety of Elmer Fudd, and
  slowly bought furniture for her enormous mansion. In many ways, the entire
  series was an inglorious swansong. And Just Like That first appeared in 2021,
  and devotees of the original might have held a tentative flicker of hope that
  in returning to these beloved characters, now in their 50s, it might find a
  way to repurpose some of its former magic for this new stage of life. It began
  with a splash by killing off Carrie’s husband, Mr Big, who had a heart attack
  while overdoing it on his stationary exercise bike. Some felt that such a
  casual death was disrespectful to the show’s history – something that would
  become a running theme – but it did, at least, suggest that the show was not
  going to hold back, or tiptoe around its past and legacy. Unfortunately, it
  went in the other direction, careering all over that legacy like a toddler
  just learning to walk. There would be no Samantha, of course: Kim Cattrall,
  who played her, has long been open about her poor relationship with her former
  cast mates and her lack of interest in returning to the show. And Just Like
  That tried to plug the Samantha gap with new friends, finding Samantha’s
  ambition in a documentary-maker, Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker), and her
  sex drive in real estate agent Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), though both
  mostly felt like superfluous distractions from the core characters. Cattrall
  did return as Samantha for 71 seconds, during the season two finale, but only
  to phone Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie to let her know that she wouldn’t make
  it to the party, after all. The scene was delicious, camp and regal, but a
  stark reminder of how much the character was missed. From its earliest days,
  And Just Like That became synonymous with hate-watching. This reached its peak
  with Miranda’s divorce from Steve and affair with Che Diaz, a non-binary
  standup comedian, who turned into one of the internet’s favourite
  least-favourite characters. Che was poorly written, sure, but they were
  indicative of the show’s haphazard handling of ageing. It largely examined
  getting older by placing characters in a state of bewilderment at how much the
  world had changed since the early 00s, which felt shallow and unflattering to
  their intelligence. They would be confused by podcasts, or restaurants with
  digital menus. The wit and acidic humour of Sex and the City allowed it to ask
  big questions, not all of which have aged well, but in And Just Like That,
  there was simply an admission that nobody really knew what was going on any
  more. All of its worst tendencies came out in the finale. Oddly, it mostly
  ended up being about Charlotte’s friend Mark, Brady, the mother of Brady’s
  unborn child and her confusingly obnoxious young genderqueer friends (let it
  go!). It was a shrug of a plotline that washed its hands of everything that
  made the characters what they once were, by deciding not to make it about the
  characters at all. Through much of the last season, there was a sense that
  Carrie has nothing to do but wander around in couture, aimlessly, too rich to
  have any ambitions left, other than a now vague notion of romantic love. It is
  not a tragedy that she waved farewell to the land of Sex and the City as a
  single woman, but it is not as poignant as the writers seem to believe it is,
  either. It’s nothing-ey, an ambient inbetween, a very And Just Like
  That-esque, “will this do?”. After a particularly hideous blocked-toilet
  episode, Carrie said the punchline that the whole scene was written to
  deliver: “Shit happens.” It was a muted note on which to bow out. They knew
  the end was coming, that much is clear. At the start of August, in the
  statement announcing that it would be ending for good, showrunner Michael
  Patrick King said that when writing the last episode, “it became clear to me
  that this might be a wonderful place to stop”. Wonderful might have been
  pushing it. It has been a curious four years, full of superfluous nonsense,
  not unpleasant, but not a patch on its TV ancestor. That blocked toilet,
  overflowing, was doing some heavy lifting when it came to the metaphor. It is
  hard to argue that And Just Like That should have gone on, when it became so
  evident that it had nowhere to go.
