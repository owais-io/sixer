  Refugee charities have warned that thousands of people in the UK could find
  themselves homeless on the streets this winter after a quiet reversal in
  asylum accommodation policy by the Home Office. The Guardian has learned that
  ministers are planning to halve the period asylum seekers are given to find
  new accommodation after getting a decision on their case from 56 to 28 days.
  Refugee organisations say this will not give people enough time to find work
  and a home to rent and will lead to people pitching tents in the streets. The
  British Red Cross is among those raising concerns about an increase in rough
  sleeping among refugees and along with other refugee NGOs calling on the
  government to rethink. Alex Fraser, the British Red Cross director of refugee
  services, said: “Reducing the ‘move-on’ period will increase levels of
  homelessness and destitution for people granted protection and put additional
  pressure on local authorities. “The numbers don’t add up. It takes around 35
  days to receive universal credit. Local authorities need 56 days to work with
  households at risk of homelessness. Giving people only 28 days to find work,
  housing or support isn’t enough time. “Making people destitute ends up costing
  the taxpayer more money and causing distress and hardship. We urge the
  government to review this decision.” The government is already grappling with
  a crisis over the use of hotels for asylum seekers with dozens of protests
  staged by anti-migrant groups and individuals in recent weeks. Ministers are
  under pressure to expedite hotel closures and have committed to speeding up
  asylum decision making, something that has been welcomed by refugee
  organisations and by asylum seekers. But if there is not sufficient time for
  refugees to find work and accommodation it is likely to lead to an increase in
  street homelessness. Government data for the year ending June 2025 showed that
  110,000 people received a decision on their asylum claim, with about half
  granted leave to remain. According to the No Accommodation Network (Naccom),
  which has 140 charity and community group members supporting people facing
  homelessness in the asylum and immigration system, in 2023/2024 homelessness
  among refugee adults increased by 99% with a sharp increase in rough sleeping
  of 125%, particularly among new refugees as a result of too short a time
  period for move on. In response to these concerns Home Office introduced a
  56-day move-on pilot scheme in December 2024 which led to a marked decrease in
  street homelessness among this group. One Red Cross source said that since the
  56-day policy was introduced they could not remember the last time a refugee
  had asked them for a tent. But now the government is reversing this and
  reverting to giving single adults just 28 days to find new accommodation. It
  is understood there will be some exceptions to the rule including pregnant
  women, families and elderly people who will still have 56 days to find a new
  home. Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais said: “Cutting the
  move-on period back to 28 days isn’t just bad for newly granted refugees, it’s
  bad for our communities and extremely bad for councils who are picking up the
  tab of increasing homelessness.” Bridget Young, director of Naccom, said: “We
  are hugely disappointed by ministers’ decision to revert back to the 28-day
  notice period for refugees with the fewest options available to them and
  therefore at most risk of homelessness and destitution. Evidence from Naccom’s
  frontline members indicates that the 56-day move-on period has been a lifeline
  for new refugees. “This decision will put more pressure on local authorities
  and voluntary sector services who always have to pick up the pieces to
  knee-jerk government policy change. This change is also being made at a time
  of increasing risk due to racism and anti-migrant rhetoric, which we worry
  will only increase the danger people will face on the streets. We urgently ask
  government to reconsider this decision.”
