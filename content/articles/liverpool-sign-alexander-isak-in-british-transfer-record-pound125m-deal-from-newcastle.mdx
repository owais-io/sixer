  Liverpool broke the British transfer record to sign Alexander Isak for £125m
  from Newcastle on deadline day but were foiled in an attempt to end a stunning
  window with a deal for Marc Guéhi. On a contrasting day for the Premier League
  champions, Isak underwent a medical on Merseyside before signing a six-year
  contract worth around £300,000 a week. Liverpool also stepped up efforts to
  sign the Crystal Palace captain, Guéhi, who had a medical in London in
  anticipation of joining Arne Slot’s side after Steve Parish, the Palace chair,
  accepted £35m plus £5m in add-ons for the defender. But Palace dramatically
  pulled the plug on the deal when they failed to sign an experienced
  replacement. Liverpool had submitted a deal sheet to complete the transfer
  after the 7pm deadline when it collapsed. A bid for Brighton’s Igor Julio fell
  through and a move for another higher-profile centre-back also failed to
  materialise. Oliver Glasner, the Palace manager, is understood to have been
  furious at the decision to accept Liverpool’s offer and reiterated his plea
  not to sell his captain during heated talks with Parish. There were even fears
  that the Austrian, who led Palace to their first trophy when they won the FA
  Cup in May, could step down after making it clear that they must keep hold of
  Guéhi to have a successful season. The England international is in the final
  year of his contract at Selhurst Park and has no intention of signing an
  extension. Liverpool may renew their attempts to sign Guehi in January but he
  could have interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich if he becomes a free
  agent next summer. Parish had said after Palace’s win in the Community Shield
  last month that it would be in the club’s best interests to sell Guéhi rather
  than lose him for free. Despite missing out on their main central defensive
  target Liverpool managed to end the summer’s longest and most acrimonious
  transfer saga in their favour with the record signing of Isak. Liverpool had a
  £110m bid for the 25-year-old rejected on 1 August. Newcastle’s position at
  that time was that Isak was not for sale. However, his subsequent strike and
  public statements allied to their £70m signing of Nick Woltemade and attempts
  to sign either Yoane Wissa or Jorgen Strand Larsen encouraged Liverpool to
  submit a higher offer on Sunday night. Newcastle accepted a fixed fee of £125m
  with no add-ons. The cancellation of loyalty bonuses to Isak means the deal is
  effectively worth £130m to Newcastle, who paid £55m to sign Wissa from
  Brentford. Wissa behaved similarly to Isak to force his move to St James’
  Park. “I want to create history. I want to win trophies,” said Isak. “That’s
  ultimately the biggest motivation for me and I feel like this is the perfect
  place for me to grow even further and to take my game to the next level and
  help the team as well. “I feel like this is the next step for me in my career.
  I’m super-happy that I’ve been given this chance and I’m very motivated to do
  something well with it.” The fee for Isak falls short of Newcastle’s £150m
  valuation but still represents a British transfer record and the second time
  this summer that Liverpool have broken their own transfer record. The
  champions paid £100m plus £16m in add-ons for Florian Wirtz in June and the
  Isak deal will take their total summer spending above £440m. Liverpool have
  recouped more than £210m in player sales. Isak in effect downed tools this
  summer. He refused to play in a pre-season friendly against Celtic and did not
  go on Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia, citing a thigh injury. Since then
  he has been absent from the squad, at one stage training alone at his former
  club Real Sociedad, and has not spoken to the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe,
  for more than a fortnight. Howe said pointedly on Friday that morale was
  strong within the Newcastle squad after a difficult opening two weeks of
  pre-season. Isak was part of pre-season training for only the first two weeks.
  The centre-forward accused Newcastle of breaking a commitment that he could
  leave if a suitable offer came from a big club and refused overtures from the
  club hierarchy to reopen negotiations over a new contract. A meeting at his
  home last Monday proved decisive. Isak informed a delegation that included
  representatives of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Newcastle’s
  financial backers, that he would never play for the club again. The Newcastle
  contingent left within 45 minutes and moves were soon made to sign Woltemade.
  Liverpool’s deadline-day business did not end with Isak and Guéhi. The
  champions accepted an offer from Aston Villa to sign Harvey Elliott on a
  season’s loan with an obligation to buy the England Under-21 international for
  £35m next summer. Liverpool also received approaches from Milan, Brighton and
  Palace for Joe Gomez in the final 24 hours of the transfer window but doubts
  over the Guéhi deal – well founded, as it turned out – meant they did not
  consider letting Gomez leave. Liverpool believe their central defensive
  options of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, Gomez and the new signing
  Giovanni Leoni, who is regarded as a potentially elite talent, should cover
  the failure to sign Guéhi.
