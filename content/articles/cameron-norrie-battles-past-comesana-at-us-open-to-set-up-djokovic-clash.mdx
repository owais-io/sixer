  Cameron Norrie continued his fine grand slam form by holding his nerve at the
  end of a bruising battle with Francisco Comesaña to win 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-7 (0)
  7-6 (4) and set up a third‑round match with Novak Djokovic. Norrie, who
  reached the fourth round of the French Open and quarter-finals at Wimbledon
  this year, had looked well on his way to victory as he established a two-set
  lead. However, as he edged close to winning, his nerves increasingly came to
  the surface. After establishing a 4-1 lead with a double break in the final
  set and then serving for the match at 5-4, Norrie found himself down set point
  at 5-6. As Comesaña lasered a backhand down the line, Norrie thought he had
  been forced to a fifth set and he began walking to his chair but the umpire
  confirmed the shot had landed out. Having been given a second chance, Norrie
  held serve to force a tie-break and then he closed out the match with
  courageous play. Norrie had toiled for nearly every point throughout the
  match, but as the match hung in the balance he closed out the match with two
  unreturned first serves. Djokovic said he is hopeful that his form will
  improve with more matches at the US Open after he struggled early on against
  an inexperienced American challenger before recovering to reach the third
  round in New York with a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win against Zachary Svajda.
  Three days after Djokovic’s difficult opening match, where he had numerous
  physical problems in an attritional tussle with Learner Tien, Djokovic was
  still searching for his form as he trailed by a set against Svajda. Although
  the Serb gradually found his way, he was also aided by the 22-year-old’s
  physical difficulties as he struggled with a left leg problem in the second
  half of the match. Despite facing the greatest player of all time in the
  biggest stadium in the sport, Svajda performed with courage early on,
  outplaying Djokovic from the baseline before closing out a tense opening set
  with a searing down-the-line backhand. But Djokovic gradually worked his way
  back into the match with efficient serving and key forays to the net. Svajda
  began to struggle with his left leg, frequently grabbing at it as his movement
  deteriorated. Despite his difficulties he led by a break at 3-1 in the third
  set following a poor service game from Djokovic – but the Serb quickly
  recovered, rolling through 11 of the next 13 games to take the match.
  Afterwards, Djokovic spoke frankly about his problems on the court: “I didn’t
  feel that great to be honest. I wasn’t happy with my tennis for the first part
  of the match, but also credit to Zach for playing some really high-quality
  tennis. “It was unfortunate that he struggled with injury towards the end of
  the second set, but kudos to him for staying on the court. It was obvious he
  couldn’t serve as well as he did for a set and a half. I wished him all the
  best at the net because I think he’s playing really well.” The US Open marks
  Djokovic’s first appearance in any competition since Wimbledon owing to the
  38-year-old opting to prioritise his family life over competing in the lengthy
  two-week Masters 1000 events in Toronto and Cincinnati. Djokovic said he is
  hoping his level will gradually improve with more matches, victories and time
  on court at the tournament. “That was the case for most of my grand slam
  career. The deeper I go in the tournament, the better I feel about my game,”
  he said. “It’s obviously a little different in the past couple of years for me
  bodywise, I get wear and tear quicker than I ever used to so I have to deal
  with that; a lot of recovery stuff to try to make myself able to perform at
  the highest level.” Djokovic was followed at Arthur Ashe Stadium by Jessica
  Pegula, the fourth seed and last year’s finalist, who eased into the third
  round with a clinical 6-1, 6-3 victory over Anna Blinkova.
