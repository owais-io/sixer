  Blockbuster Champions League draw is intriguing but ultimately irrelevant |

  Liverpool v Real Madrid! Arsenal v Bayern! Chelsea v Napoli! Madrid v
  Manchester City! Bayern v Chelsea! Newcastle v Barcelona! Inter v Liverpool!
  PSG v Bayern! City v Napoli! Madrid v Juventus! Chelsea v Barcelona! It can’t
  be denied that the Champions League draw threw up some ties that look like
  massive games. These are games that have massive teams in them. They are
  happening in a massive competition. There will be famous players in famous
  kits in famous stadiums. There will be Champions League branding. They will
  play the Champions League theme tune. They will use the Champions League ball,
  taking its cues this season from the night sky and featuring hand-drawn zodiac
  signs in gold that symbolise heroic deeds and heavenly destiny. It will all
  look like something really important. On 28 January there will be a massive,
  barely comprehensible night of 18 simultaneous games, games in which last
  season, as Giorgio Marchetti, Uefa’s excitable deputy general secretary,
  breathlessly reported: “Almost every team changed their position on the table
  at least once.” And amid the blur of goals and flashing as-it-stands tables,
  perhaps nobody will realise that nothing that has gone before really matters
  all that much, that we have played 144 games to get a predictable last 24.
  Only then does the real business begin. There was a surprising amount of
  positivity about the revamped Champions League last season, much of it
  emanating from Uefa, whose representatives spent the draw ceremony announcing
  once again that everything had been a tremendous success – although without
  offering any data to support that assertion, such as, say, viewing figures.
  They did mention a record high for goals-per-game, but that will happen when
  you have teams as defensively hapless as RB Salzburg, Slovan Bratislava and
  Young Boys. Before the draw, and before another excruciating video – was
  recording that why Aleksander Ceferin couldn’t manage to attend more than two
  games at the women’s Euros? – Uefa showed a clip of their video from last year
  explaining the new format, which featured Zlatan Ibrahimovic promising “more
  football” and “more jeopardy”. On the former count, Uefa delivered; on the
  latter, rather less so. Liverpool beating Real Madrid and Arsenal beating
  Paris Saint-Germain, in the moment, felt like significant events; it was only
  later it became apparent how misleading, how irrelevant, those games were.
  Perhaps football these days really is just about the absorption of content and
  fans will continue to lap up clashes between big sides, however meaningless –
  or perhaps there will be a reaction. Clubs too may conclude that there’s no
  real need to go hard in every game. It may be nice to finish in the top eight
  – although it’s telling that the main reward is to be spared the burden of
  playing in two further games – but it’s far from essential. It may even be
  worth a genuine contender fielding a second string against a fellow elite club
  rather than give them a rehearsal for a potentially far more significant game
  later in the competition. This is the problem when football just becomes about
  the production of content, none of which means very much. There is some
  intrigue. Chelsea will play Napoli, Benfica, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, all
  of their opponents from the knockout stage in 2011-12 when they won the
  Champions League for the first time. Trent Alexander-Arnold might return to
  Anfield as Liverpool host Real Madrid, a repeat of no fewer than three
  European Cup/Champions League finals. Madrid, in fact, will face five former
  champions. Arsenal have home games against Bayern and Atlético, but a draw
  kind enough to be targeting top eight and a couple of midweeks off in
  February. Tottenham also can think the computer randomiser was generous. They
  face the champions, PSG, away, but proved in the Super Cup they can live with
  them, and also return to Bodø/Glimt whom they beat over two legs in the Europa
  League semi-final last season. Newcastle can reprise one of their most famous
  Champions League nights as they face Barcelona at home, and also take on PSG
  at the Parc des Princes where they were involved a controversial draw two
  seasons ago. PSG, in fact, look to have a relatively tough test, all their
  opponents coming from Germany, Spain, Italy, England and Portugal. But
  fundamentally the big teams will get through: five wins and a draw will
  probably secure top eight, or three wins and two draws for a spot in the
  playoffs. The odd team from outside the elite might make the playoffs and
  everybody will talk about the opportunities the new format affords, and by the
  last 16 we’ll be back to the usual suspects from the familiar western European
  leagues, Uefa will declare it all a massive success. Then we’ll get a game
  like last season’s remarkable Inter v Barcelona clash in the semi-final, and
  all the nonsense that preceded it will be forgotten.
