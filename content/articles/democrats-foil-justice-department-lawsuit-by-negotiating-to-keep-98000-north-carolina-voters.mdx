  Democrats notched a victory against the civil rights division of the
  Department of Justice, negotiating an agreement to keep about 98,000 North
  Carolina voters from being prevented from voting. The justice department,
  which under Donald Trump has moved away from its historical focus on expanding
  voting rights, sued the North Carolina state board of elections earlier this
  year, demanding that the state deny a ballot to voters who had not provided a
  driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security
  number when they registered, as required under the Help America Vote Act. The
  North Carolina court of appeals ordered the board to seek the information from
  voters before allowing them to vote in future elections, and the
  Republican-majority board was going to comply before the Democratic National
  Committee (DNC) and voting rights groups in the state intervened. The DNC
  asserted that the actions demanded by the justice department violated the
  National Voter Registration Act and had partisan purposes. The proposed
  consent order and agreement between the justice department and the state of
  North Carolina settles the justice department lawsuit and allows voters who
  had not provided the information to do so while voting with a provisional
  ballot, which would cure the problem at the polling place. Judge Richard E
  Myers II, chief of the US district court for the eastern district of North
  Carolina, must still approve the agreement, said Patrick Gannon, public
  information director at the state board of elections. The voting rights
  section of the Department of Justice’s civil rights division has historically
  been an enforcer of the Voting Rights Act and the principles of greater ballot
  access and universal suffrage. Under Harmeet Dhillon, the division’s assistant
  attorney general, that tradition has been turned on its head. Dhillon gutted
  the department’s leadership and staff in April shortly after being confirmed,
  and has refocused the department’s mission on preventing voter fraud and
  prosecuting noncitizen voting – both of which are exceedingly rare.
