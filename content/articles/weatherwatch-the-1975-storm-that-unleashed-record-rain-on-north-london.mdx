  On the afternoon of 14 August 1975 the thunderstorms that developed across
  eastern England included a particularly intense outbreak in north London that
  became known as the Hampstead Storm. This storm brought an astonishing 170.8mm
  (6.72in) of precipitation over a 24-hour period, the largest daily total
  recorded in the London area. Almost all of it fell in a colossal downpour of
  rain and hail from 5.30pm to 8.00pm. According to the New York Times travel
  writer John Hillaby, the rain was so intense it “fell in misty sheets with a
  noise like boiling fat”. Stormwater sewers were quickly overwhelmed and the
  rivers Tyburn, Fleet and Brent burst their banks to flood gardens and streets.
  Torrents of water flowed into the underground, causing electrical faults and
  shutting down the Bakerloo and Metropolitan lines. Reports described cars
  floating down streets that had turned into canals. Overflows of raw sewage
  mixed with the flood water, and hundreds of people were forced to leave their
  homes as basement flats were inundated. Newspaper photographs showed evacuees
  in small boats pulled by emergency workers. In a subsequent inquiry, the chair
  of the Greater London council public services committee insisted the sewers
  were in fact adequate. But, like other sewers, they were never intended to
  handle a deluge of such biblical proportions.
