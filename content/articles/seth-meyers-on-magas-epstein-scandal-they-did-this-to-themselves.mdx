  Late-night hosts continued to track the fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein
  scandal that Donald Trump just won’t let go and the Environmental Protection
  Agency giving up on the environment. Seth Meyers Seth Meyers continued to
  relish Donald Trump’s Jeffrey Epstein scandal that just won’t go away, as the
  president was hounded by questions about his friendship with the convicted sex
  offender while in Scotland. “They did this to themselves,” the Late Night host
  said of Maga’s Epstein quagmire. “This is like if after Trump screamed they’re
  eating the dogs in a debate, Donald Trump started eating the dog.” Despite
  Trump’s evident frustration with the topic, “people haven’t moved on, because
  Trump and his Maga mates spent years cynically hyping up the Epstein
  conspiracy,” Meyers explained on Wednesday evening. “They thought only their
  political enemies would be harmed. But they either forgot or completely
  ignored the fact that Trump was Epstein’s best friend. It’s like basing an
  entire political movement around your opposition to Bert, and then voting for
  Ernie for president.” Meyers then poked fun at Trump’s many defenses against
  the Epstein scandal, starting with his claim that he didn’t send a lewd
  birthday greeting to Epstein featuring a nude drawing of a woman, as reported
  by the Wall Street Journal. As Trump said: “I don’t do drawings of women.”
  “The way you keep saying ‘I don’t do drawings of women,’ instead of just
  saying ‘I don’t do drawings of people’ makes it sound like you do a ton of
  drawings of dudes,” Meyers laughed. Trump then “dug the hole deeper” by saying
  that his friendship with Epstein ended only because Epstein hired employees
  out from under him. “That’s not helping you, dude! Going out of your way to
  explain that you cut ties with a monster not because he was a monster, but
  because he hired people away from you makes you sound even worse,” said
  Meyers. “That’s like saying you stopped inviting Charles Manson to parties
  because he wouldn’t use a coaster.” Asked on the flight back from Scotland if
  the workers Epstein hired away from Trump were young women, the president
  responded: “Well, I don’t want to say, but everyone knows the people who were
  taken. And the concept of taking people who work for me is bad.” He then
  confirmed that they were indeed young women who worked at the spa – “a great
  spa, one of the best spas in the world”. Meyers just laughed – “If this were a
  Law &amp; Order episode, right about here is where Trump’s attorney would turn
  to Jack McCoy and say, ‘He doesn’t say any more until we have a deal.’”
  Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert reacted to news that the
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking to throw out the
  “endangerment finding” from 2009 that found that greenhouse gases endanger
  health and public welfare. Eliminating the rule will allow the Trump
  administration to scrap rules to reduce climate pollution from cars and
  trucks. “OK, but you’re the Environmental Protection Agency. You’re supposed
  to protect the environment!” Colbert fumed. “You’re just giving up? This
  explains why Woodsy Owl has updated his catchphrase to: ‘Why give a hoot? I’m
  just filling my pockets with rocks and walking into the river like Virginia
  Woolf.’” Trump’s EPA head, Lee Zeldin, appeared on Fox News with the energy
  secretary, Chris Wright, to push back on what they see as a “climate change
  hoax”. “The goal is to restore confidence in science and data and
  rationalism,” Wright said. “That is what enabled the creation of modern
  science, then we slid back into this kind of cancel culture, Orwellian
  squelching of science.” “Nice try, fellas, but it makes it hard to dismiss
  global warming when you’re sharing the screen with a heat index of 126 degrees
  in Missouri,” Colbert responded. In “more proof” that “the Earth is mad at
  us,” there was also a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off the coast of
  Russia’s eastern Kamchatka peninsula. There were only a few injuries, despite
  the fact that the quake occurred along Russia’s so-called “megathrust” fault
  line. “Yes, the Megathrust Fault, which is right next to Humpmaster Canyon and
  the Cape of I Had a Big Dinner, Can We Just Watch Gilded Age?” Colbert joked.
