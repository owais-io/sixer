  Teenagers who have moderate or severe period pain are much more likely to
  develop chronic pain as adults, according to research. Researchers said the
  findings should serve as a wake-up call to improve menstrual education, reduce
  stigma, and ensure young people have access to effective support and treatment
  early on. Academics at the University of Oxford analysed data from more than
  1,100 participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and
  found that, compared with those who did not have painful menses, those with
  severe period pain (dysmenorrhoea) at 15 years old had a 76% higher risk of
  chronic pain by the age of 26, while those with moderate period pain were 65%
  more likely to have chronic pain as adults. While previous research has
  focused on pelvic pain, the authors say this study, funded by the Medical
  Research Foundation and published in the Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health
  journal, is the first to reveal a link between adolescent period pain and
  chronic pain in other parts of the body. Moderate to severe period pain was
  strongly associated with the risk of developing chronic pain in the lower back
  and abdomen. But the findings also revealed that compared with those who did
  not have dysmenorrhoea, teenagers with severe period pain were more than twice
  as likely to develop chronic headaches or chronic knee, wrist, hand, foot or
  ankle pain in adulthood, and were 81% and 78% more likely to have hip and
  upper back pain respectively. While anxiety and depression could play a role
  in the development of chronic pain as an adult, the study found this was only
  a minor factor. The researchers believe that greater “neuroplasticity” during
  adolescence could make teenage brains more sensitive to repeated pain signals,
  which could change how they process pain in the brain. Dr Rachel Reid-McCann,
  the lead researcher at the University of Oxford, said: “It is possible that
  the experience of moderate or severe period pain can alter the brain structure
  and how it functions in response to painful stimuli, making chronic pain more
  likely in the future.” Katy Vincent, a professor of gynaecological pain at the
  University of Oxford and the senior author of the study, said: “We’ve known
  for a long time that period pain can really disrupt young people’s lives,
  impacting their social development, education and mental health. “However, we
  know that most young people don’t seek help for period pain and those who do
  may be dismissed, belittled or told it is normal. This study shows that
  teenage period pain may also shape future physical health.” Responding to the
  findings, Prof Ranee Thakar, the president of the Royal College of
  Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said a period “shouldn’t stop you from going
  to work or school”. “If you have severe pain that doesn’t improve with
  over-the-counter pain relief and affects your daily life, speak to your GP –
  you may need a referral to a gynaecologist. “Too many women and girls are
  currently living with debilitating menstrual pain. We need better awareness,
  more inclusive education and faster diagnosis – especially for those in
  deprived or marginalised communities. We’re calling on the government to
  refresh the women’s health strategy and improving the care of menstrual health
  conditions should be a priority within this.” Janet Lindsay, the chief
  executive of the charity Wellbeing of Women, which runs the Just a Period
  campaign, said: “For too long, girls have become accustomed to putting up with
  pain, leading to delays in diagnosis, dismissal of symptoms, and ongoing
  stigma around menstruation. “If we fail to take teenage period pain seriously,
  we risk storing up a lifetime of ill health and chronic pain for millions of
  women. By investing in education, awareness and support during the school
  years, we can empower young people, improve women’s health outcomes and end
  the cycle of stigma once and for all.” A Department of Health and Social Care
  spokesperson said: “All women and girls deserve to be listened to and treated
  with respect. It should never be the case that period pains, which can be
  severe, are dismissed and women told to ‘just put up with it’. “We know women
  deserve better, which is why we are turning the commitments in the women’s
  health strategy into tangible action, already delivering 4.9m extra
  appointments, tackling gynaecology waiting lists using the private sector, and
  from October this year making emergency hormonal contraception free in
  pharmacies.”
