  I was 18 when I tried a menstrual cup for the first time. I was studying at
  the University of Edinburgh and Scotland had just become the first country in
  the world to make period products free to those who need them. The university
  health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads
  and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t
  resist a freebie. I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period
  products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an
  overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought
  non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It
  was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak,
  run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often
  than I cared to admit. When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was
  sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I
  realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of
  attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no
  going back. Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These
  days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the
  size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my
  period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water,
  place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s
  clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.
  The benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk
  of tampons or sanitary pads, and steer clear of the toxic chemicals that are
  common in many tampons. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone,
  last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced
  since using a cup. I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic,
  packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a
  menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every
  month. They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at
  home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has
  never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent
  surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a
  lifesaver. The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch.
  More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare
  tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned
  my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and
  I haven’t looked back since.
