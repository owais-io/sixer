  There was a time, not that long ago, when almost all big games were stiflingly
  tense affairs – cautious, cagey, almost unwatchable but for the exquisite
  tension, the sense that this was too important to expect the football to be
  entertaining. The goal-heavy thrillers of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp
  rivalry were a welcome diversion, but they always felt oddly transgressive –
  were we sure major clashes were supposed to be that much fun? In that sense,
  Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Arsenal on Sunday fit into a long-established
  tradition; in time the tedium will fall away in the collective memory and all
  that will remain is the majesty of Dominik Szoboszlai’s match-winning
  free-kick. Two other more recent traditions were observed amid the anxiety of
  Anfield: that Arne Slot will always somehow find a way, and that Arsenal will
  always somehow come up short. Few managers have ever had such a golden touch
  as Slot; he has a remarkable capacity to make decisions that don’t just change
  the outcome of a game, but do so in an obvious and unmissable way. Liverpool
  have not been anywhere near their best this season. They have looked open and
  unbalanced. They are, of course, dealing with their grief at the death of
  Diogo Jota. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Luis Díaz and Darwin Núñez have been sold.
  Five senior players have arrived, with Alexander Isak set to join that list.
  And yet at the international break, they stand top of the Premier League table
  as the only side with three wins from three. Against Bournemouth and
  Newcastle, they let slip two-goal advantages and then regained the lead with
  goals from substitutes. Against Arsenal, they were more cautious, perhaps
  overcompensating for the wildness that had characterised the opening two
  games. According to Opta, they mustered an xG of just 0.4 against Arsenal’s
  0.5, by a factor of almost two the lowest combined xG in a game so far this
  season. And yet they won. There had seemed a danger before the season began
  that Szoboszlai would be the odd man out. If Florian Wirtz, signed for £100m
  (about $135m), operated behind the striker in a 4-2-3-1, it seemed reasonable
  to assume that the two more defensive players in last season’s midfield trio,
  Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister, would play as the pair in front of
  the back four. And so, since Gravenberch returned having missed the Community
  Shield as his partner gave birth and the opening game of the season through
  suspension, it has proved. But with Alexander-Arnold gone, Jeremie Frimpong
  injured and Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez returning to fitness, Szoboszlai found
  himself drafted in as an improbable auxiliary right-back. Who, honestly, can
  say they thought he had the skill-set to play at full-back? But he has taken
  to the role with gusto and has played a decisive part in the last two wins.
  Against Newcastle last week, Szoboszlai looked rather more comfortable than
  the career full-back on the other flank, his compatriot Milos Kerkez, who has
  had a difficult start to life at Liverpool. Then, having been released into
  midfield by the introduction of Bradley, it was Szoboszlai’s dummy that
  created the space for Rio Ngumoha’s injury-time winner. On Sunday he arced a
  stunning 32-yard free-kick in off the inside of the post with seven minutes
  remaining. Will Szoboszlai remain at right-back? It remains implausible, and
  yet he has already performed creditably there against two of last season’s top
  five. While Mohamed Salah has had a slow start – his relationship with Hugo
  Ekitiké is still in its infancy, and his touch looks unusually deliberate –
  Szoboszlai has at least started to offer the sort of precise early passes that
  Alexander-Arnold gave the Egyptian, something Frimpong, more of a
  ball-carrier, did not. Temporary or not, Slot has found a solution that has
  worked. He has a glorious knack of shifting games to his will. The contrast
  with Mikel Arteta is obvious. Arteta has done a remarkable job in his five and
  a half years at Arsenal: he has turned a drifting club into serious title
  challengers. They are no longer the soft touches of old, unbeaten in 22 games
  against “big six” sides before Sunday (although whether Manchester United and
  Tottenham justify inclusion in that designation remains debatable). But
  equally, Arteta has never won at Anfield or the Etihad. Could he be blamed for
  caginess given he was missing Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz, with Martin
  Ødegaard restricted to a role from the bench and William Saliba going off
  early? Perhaps not. But Arsenal have a depth of squad these days. Mikel Merino
  in midfield and Noni Madueke on the right are not bad options. Liverpool were
  vulnerable, yet Arsenal barely tested them. Against Manchester United and
  Leeds, they had been similarly passive, waiting for a mistake, and then taking
  advantage. Liverpool did not succumb. And while Arsenal could say it took a
  freakishly brilliant free-kick to beat them, it would be just as true to say
  that Arteta’s record is of near-misses, while Slot somehow keeps producing
  wins from nowhere. This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a
