  Are we letting ‘stranger danger’ get in the way of connecting with our
  community?

  About six months ago, a friend and I took our kids along to the shopping
  centre in Ballarat for some school holiday activities. When I rocked up, my
  friend was already deep in conversation with another mum, who was not
  initially known to us. I joined in on the yarn, in my usual fashion, and by
  the end of it we’d all exchanged numbers and invited the new mum over to our
  home as well as an event at our community hub. Friends often gasp when we
  retell this story. Approaching someone unknown and proceeding to ask for their
  digits? The audacity! We have become so used to operating in isolation,
  segregating ourselves from the world and those around us, that it has become a
  challenge to push beyond our comfort zone and engage with people we don’t
  know. God forbid we exchange words with someone random, let alone extend our
  circle of friends. According to the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in
  Australia survey, an estimated 15% of Australians aged 15 and over were
  experiencing social isolation in 2023. The Australian Institute of Health and
  Welfare states that social isolation and loneliness can harm mental and
  physical health and may affect life satisfaction. Sign up to receive Guardian

  more of an effort to embrace more people into our lives? To connect with more
  people? To even meet our neighbours? According to a 2020 study, there were 40
  reasons which prevented people from making friends – with the main one being
  low trust, followed by lack of time, and introversion. But growing up, I saw
  how my parents and broader community constantly worked to foster friendships –
  old and new – with love, warmth and openness. Time wasn’t a barrier. The aim
  of the game was to open our home, to invite people in, to share a meal. I will
  always see in my mum and dad their willingness to connect with those around
  them. Even now, more than 30 years after I moved to Ballarat, I’ll see people
  from my childhood down the street and they’ll stop to chat. “You were my
  neighbour! I still remember eating all those Persian sugar cubes in your
  house!” And when we recoil at the thought of meeting new people, because we
  don’t trust anyone or it’s too hard, we run the risk of our children modelling
  our attitudes and behaviours. It makes me sad that we teach “stranger danger”
  with no context, rather than teaching our children about how to be safe but
  still promoting that, at the end of the day, we are all part of one human
  family, interconnected and bleeding the same. I’m not suggesting we lead a
  life of ignorance. People have lost trust in humanity – and for good reason.
  We have become aware of harrowing cases of institutional child sexual abuse –
  in Ballarat in particular that trauma is never far from the surface. The
  recent case of a Melbourne childcare worker charged with the alleged sexual
  abuse of children and infants in his care has amplified parental concerns and
  sparked immediate childcare safety reviews and reforms at the federal and
  state level. Our interactions need to be approached with a level of wisdom and
  safety has to be a top concern. This isn’t about welcoming everyone into our
  home without a second thought. Conversations about personal space and safety
  need to be a high priority in all settings. It’s about being vigilant and
  educating the community – especially our young ones – about the signs to look
  out for, about when to speak out, about who to turn to for help. But we must
  not let fear come at the expense of community. I was recently reminded of the
  saying: “A stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet.” I can’t imagine my
  life without my friend who I met from being friendly at the shops on that day
  six months ago. We share our thoughts, clothes, food, and even shared our
  birthday together this past month. My village expanded the day I met her, and
  other friends like her, simply because I stopped to say “hi”. A 2020 study
  found that preventing and reducing social isolation and loneliness required “a
  comprehensive socioecological framework that fosters a broader culture of
  connection, rather than relying solely on individual-level interventions or
  targeting only vulnerable communities”. Quite often I’ll be running errands
  and strike up a conversation with someone I don’t know, wondering if they’ll
  be my next new mate. My children wonder why I’m always talking to random
  people, though my son said just the other day that he too loves talking to
  strangers. I hope this openness will remain throughout his life, but more than
  that, I hope society will be in a position to have normalised it. Sign up for
