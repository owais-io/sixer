  The Metropolitan police have used controversial powers to stop and search
  protesters almost 50 times since they were introduced, with nearly all
  instances at a peaceful pro-Palestine demonstration, a civil liberties group
  has found. Police in England and Wales can carry out suspicionless stop and
  searches in relation to protest activity under section 11 of the Public Order
  Act 2023, which came into force on 20 December 2023. Analysis by Big Brother
  Watch found the Met had used the powers against 47 demonstrators, 40 of whom
  were attending a Gaza protest by Youth Demand in July last year, which began
  in Russell Square Gardens, central London. Jake Hurfurt, head of research and
  investigations at Big Brother Watch, said: “When the Public Order Act was
  passed, civil liberties groups warned that these draconian new powers could be
  used to stifle protest rights. “The apparent targeting of pro-Palestine
  protest in the prime minister’s constituency only underlines the danger these
  broadly drawn stop and search powers pose to our right to free assembly. “This
  Met police data gives an alarming impression of police selectively targeting
  protesters. Zero arrests from 40 searches suggests that there was no
  justification for officers to use these powers at that protest.” The section
  11 power can be used when a police officer of inspector rank or above
  authorises its use in a specific area for a period not exceeding 24 hours.
  They must reasonably believe that an offence – such as public nuisance or
  locking on – may be committed in the area, or that people there might be
  carrying prohibited objects in relation to such offences. While some rightwing
  figures have accused police of “two-tier policing”, alleging far-right
  protesters are treated more harshly, Big Brother Watch found that section 11
  powers were not reported as having been used by forces during last year’s
  racially motivated riots after the Southport attack. When the public order
  bill was going through parliament, MPs and peers on the human rights committee
  claimed it was creating a “hostile environment” for peaceful protests. Earlier
  this month, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) wrote to the home
  secretary, Yvette Cooper, and the Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, expressing
  concern at the approach to Gaza protests. Kishwer Falkner, the EHRC chair,
  said: “Heavy-handed policing or blanket approaches risk creating a chilling
  effect, deterring citizens from exercising their fundamental rights to freedom
  of expression and assembly through fear of possible consequences.” A Met
  police spokesperson said: “We have a duty to intervene where protest activity
  causes serious disruption to the lives of the wider community, or where it
  crosses the line into criminality. “We will consider all the powers available
  to us when responding to intelligence about crime and disorder, including
  carrying out searches where we believe it is likely people will have items on
  them that could be used to commit offences. “Our policing approach is
  certainly not dependent on whose constituency a protest takes place in is. We
  are independent of politicians and police without fear or favour.”
