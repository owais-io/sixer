  In the long history of Hollywood excess, there is no tale as torrid as that of
  Queen Kelly. This lavish silent melodrama starring Gloria Swanson and directed
  by Erich von Stroheim will screen as the pre-opening event at this year’s
  Venice film festival, with a new score by composer Eli Denson. The film is an
  outlandish saga of illicit love in sordid surroundings – and so is the story
  of its production. Queen Kelly is set in Europe before the first world war and
  tells the story of Patricia Kelly (Swanson), a convent girl who falls in love
  with a prince (British actor Walter Byron) who is engaged to a deranged queen.
  Patricia is sent away to Tanzania, where she is forced into marriage with a
  vile character called Jan, later earning the nickname Queen Kelly. It’s a
  far-fetched tale, which sets a curious tone from the beginning with its
  infamous meet-cute, in which Patricia is so overawed by meeting the prince
  that her knickers fall to the ground. On the first day of shooting in 1928,
  Swanson had a premonition that the film would never be finished, and events
  proved her correct. The screening at Venice consists of a new restoration by
  Dennis Doros that incorporates previously unseen material, and some inventive
  methods of recreating the film’s grand finale. He describes this version as a
  “reimagining”. Viewers of the film have always had to fill in the gaps, as did
  those who wanted to learn what happened behind the scenes. The story of the
  film begins with a love affair. In 1927 Swanson was one of the biggest stars
  in Hollywood, married to French war hero Marquis Henry de la Falaise, when she
  met the married Boston businessman Joseph P Kennedy, father of the Kennedy
  clan. The following year Swanson and Kennedy became lovers, and their
  relationship was soon an open secret in Hollywood. Swanson, who was living
  beyond her generous means, put her financial affairs in his hands. Kennedy had
  been in the movie business for some years, and together they planned a
  lucrative showcase for Swanson’s talent. Making an expensive silent film when
  the talkie revolution was already in motion was one questionable decision. The
  next was hiring Von Stroheim to write and direct it. He was anything but a
  safe bet, known for his censor-baiting storylines, immense profligacy
  (insisting the extras in 1922’s Foolish Wives be supplied with silk underwear)
  and epic running times (his original cut of 1924’s Greed was said to be nine
  hours long). Von Stroheim proved as immoderate as ever. In the third month of
  filming, with costs soaring, Swanson and Kennedy called the whole thing off.
  Her objection was that Von Stroheim had taken the narrative in a direction
  that would never pass the censors. The scenes they were working on in Africa
  were clearly set in a brothel. She was exhausted by his reshoots and horrified
  by having to do a scene in which Jan (Tully Marshall) dribbled tobacco juice
  on to her hand. She called up Kennedy, saying: “Our director is a madman.” For
  his part, Von Stroheim claimed the shoot was abandoned purely because the
  coming of sound rendered this expensive silent film obsolete. Whatever the
  reason, Swanson and Kennedy cut their losses, which totalled a reputed
  $800,000. Von Stroheim was unceremoniously removed from the project. He would
  never complete a film as director again, although he would continue to find
  success as an actor, dubbed the “The Man You Love to Hate” for playing German
  villains, most notably in Jean Renoir’s 1937 classic La Grande Illusion.
  Swanson and Kennedy tried to complete the film as a talkie and even a musical.
  A 1932 cut of Queen Kelly was shown in a few countries, but this was
  essentially only the film’s first half. Fast-forward to 1950, when Swanson
  staged her own glorious comeback, playing washed-up silent film star Norma
  Desmond in Billy Wilder’s black comedy Sunset Boulevard. None other than Von
  Stroheim was hired to play Norma’s butler, the man who keeps her fantasy of
  enduring fame alive. And when Wilder needed to use a scene from one of Norma’s
  old movies? A clip of Queen Kelly was chosen. Swanson was back in the
  spotlight, and one of her most famous follies was once more a talking point.
  From then on, she did her best to revive the project she once thought was
  doomed – screening her cut of the film at one-off events and even on US TV,
  with the words: “This Queen Kelly gal was a child that somehow didn’t want to
  be born.” Swanson died in 1983, just two years before Doros completed his
  first reconstruction. He used Swanson’s own prints and outtakes, which had
  been preserved at the George Eastman Museum. This new restoration, and its
  red-carpet premiere in Venice, may just be everything that Swanson dreamed of
  for her lovechild Queen Kelly. Von Stroheim, one suspects, would prefer to try
  a few more takes. • Queen Kelly screens in Venice on 26 August
