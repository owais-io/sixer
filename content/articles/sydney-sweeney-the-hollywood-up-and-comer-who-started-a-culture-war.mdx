  Almost exactly three years ago, in July 2022, the actor Sydney Sweeney gave an
  interview to the Hollywood Reporter that was refreshingly frank about
  finances. At the time, Sweeney was 24, fresh off the contentious buzz of
  Euphoria’s second season, and undeniably on the up in Hollywood as one of gen
  Z’s very few in-demand actors. And yet, as she told the magazine, she did not
  have the money to cover even a six-month break from the industry. Unlike some
  of her Euphoria peers, Sweeney is not a nepo baby; she was raised middle-class
  in northern Idaho and Spokane, Washington, and began working as a child actor
  at 13. She acted continuously throughout her teens – on Criminal Minds and
  Grey’s Anatomy, then small roles on prestige projects like Sharp Objects, The
  Handmaid’s Tale and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood –
  because there was no fallback cushion. “I don’t have someone supporting me, I
  don’t have anyone I can turn to, to pay my bills or call for help,” she said.
  Even after working on a hit HBO show, which did allow her to buy a house in
  LA, money was tight. “They don’t pay actors like they used to, and with
  streamers, you no longer get residuals,” Sweeney explained. “The established
  stars still get paid, but I have to give 5% to my lawyer, 10% to my agents, 3%
  or something like that to my business manager. I have to pay my publicist
  every month, and that’s more than my mortgage.” Sweeney spoke with the
  authority and detail of someone who actually had to review her budget every
  month – for the stylist, the publicist, the makeup, the travel, the unspoken
  demands of being a fame-aiming young actor in the Instagram age, and
  particularly a young beautiful woman. Hence, her many brand deals – Miu Miu,
  Armani, Laneige. “If I just acted, I wouldn’t be able to afford my life in
  LA,” she said. “I take deals because I have to.” I still think about this
  interview whenever Sweeney’s name comes up, which is too often lately. For
  one, it’s still the most transparent I’ve ever heard an actor of her cohort be
  about money – no one is talking about paying their publicist or their mortgage
  – and two, it helps explain her increasingly omnipresent and fractious brand
  deals that have arguably eclipsed her acting work. Sweeney doesn’t just rep
  high-end fashion labels like Miu Miu, typical for actors attempting to enter
  the rarefied field of movie stardom; she’s now also selling soap allegedly
  containing a “touch” of her bathwater for Dr Squatch, ice-cream for
  Baskin-Robbins, and fuzzy pink loafers for who knows who. You may have heard
  that she’s recently found herself in the culture-war crosshairs over some ads
  for American Eagle. As the camera pans over a horizontal Sweeney zipping up
  her tight blue jeans, she says in typical monotone: “Genes are passed down
  from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color,
  personality, and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” Another spot finds her
  admonishing a wandering camera away from her two most talked-about assets –
  “eyes up here”. The ad, predictably, caused a stir on an internet where
  everything is now ragebait – the posting left said its invocation of Americana
  and “great genes” dogwhistled white supremacy, the Maga right celebrated it as
  a nail in the coffin of “wokeness”. (For what it’s worth, American Eagle has
  said that the campaign “is and always was about the jeans”.) Trump posted
  about it on Truth Social. And all of that was before it was revealed that
  Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida in June 2024. All of this, it
  must be noted, has happened without Sweeney publicly saying a thing. (One can
  assume, based on her comments about money and an old social media brouhaha
  about Maga family members, that she supported Donald Trump in 2024, and that
  she moved to Florida for tax reasons. But until Sweeney confirms anything,
  these remain assumptions.) How does a relatively successful Hollywood actor
  with at least one box office hit under her belt – that would be the middling
  but popular 2024 romcom Anyone But You – end up this polarizing? Two separate
  but inextricable things: an incendiary combination of social media’s death
  spiral into hollow, fleeting culture wars, and a career spent walking the
  perilously thin line between poking fun at male egos and inflating them. The
  former is more easily identified – the internet culture Substack Garbage Day
  traced the American Eagle controversy to a familiar pattern of activity on X,
  a site that is a fraction of the size it used to be and is now about 75% bots;
  the remaining holdouts are “conservative aggregators, business world
  influencers, celebrity stan accounts, and libs who won’t leave the site and
  still post like it’s 2018”. The ad, an artless mix of lowest-common
  denominator triggers, worked on all four groups. The cycle frothed enough on X
  over a weekend to get picked up by Fox News, then the most smug Maga
  politicians looking for a dunk, and then, inevitably, the president who must
  always get in on the attention. In the posting economy, all that matters is
  that the controversy feels real, and everyone is talking about it. Whatever
  the actual size of the outrage – I, for one, sense more fatigue than actual
  anger – the chatter does represent a natural endpoint to Sweeney’s
  longstanding tactic of being the first to acknowledge, and now bank on, male
  attention on her breasts, and to be ruthlessly pragmatic about business. Both
  are dubious tactics with, I’d argue, diminishing returns. I have been a fan of
  Sweeney’s since she broke out as a terrifyingly droll gen Z menace on the
  first season of The White Lotus in 2021, and I date the shift to 2022, around
  the time of that landmark THR interview. When I interviewed Sweeney in 2021,
  the then-23-year-old was as open about her business ambitions – getting a
  bachelor’s degree to prevent getting “fucked over” by contract negotiations,
  producing her own projects – as she was wary about the internet’s outrage
  machine. She was promoting her erotic thriller The Voyeurs, in which she
  appeared nude, and dealing with the aftermath of nude screenshots from
  Euphoria making the rounds online. Her strategy for handling it all, she told
  me, was dissociation: “I never actually put Syd out there,” she said. “No one
  really knows Syd.” In the years since, Sweeney seems to have adopted a more
  offensive approach to the attention – and her elevation by the male right as,
  to quote the New Yorker’s Lauren Michele Jackson, “rejoicing in a perceived
  return to a bygone beauty standard in the wake of all that overzealous
  feminism they blame on the left” – by turning it into money and a punchline.
  She poked fun at boob fixation with a Hooters skit on SNL; she wore a
  sweatshirt blaring “SORRY FOR HAVING GREAT TITS AND CORRECT OPINIONS”; she
  routinely addresses the boobs in the room with a broad-like confidence. “The
  biggest misconception about me is that I’m a dumb blonde with big tits,” she
  said in an interview last year. “I’m naturally a brunette.” Cue laughs. At the
  same time, she’s exemplified the pop feminist mantra of getting one’s bag –
  starring in the dreadful Madame Web was a “business decision” to network with
  Sony execs and get her planned Barbarella remake greenlit and Anyone But You
  sold, which she successfully marketed on her own TikTok. Taking every brand
  deal while producing would-be auteur horror with Immaculate. All of this has,
  unfortunately, overshadowed a promising dramatic acting career, as
  demonstrated by a remarkable turn in Reality, as a real-life whistleblower
  brimming with anxiety and righteousness; in The Voyeurs, a throwback erotic
  thriller that would have made more of a splash had it not been dropped on
  Amazon; and on Euphoria, where she imbued the beleaguered Cassie with a real
  sense of teenage volatility. Amid the political controversy, Sweeney remains,
  as ever, booked and busy. She’s making an awards play with Christy, as the 90s
  boxer Christy Martin, and aiming for critical buzz with The Housemaid, Paul
  Feig’s film alongside Amanda Seyfried. She’s locked down two huge video game
  remakes with Michael Bay and Jon M Chu, secured the role of 50s bombshell Kim
  Novak in Colman Domingo’s directorial debut Scandalous!, and just appeared
  alongside Julianne Moore in yet another forgettable Apple TV+ film. On the
  acting side, she’s still the young woman from three years ago, clear-eyed
  about the industry, trying everything, lining up the work. For all our sakes,
  let’s hope the conversation gets back there, too.
