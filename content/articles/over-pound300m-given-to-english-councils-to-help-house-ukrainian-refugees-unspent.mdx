  More than £300m given to English councils to help Ukrainian refugees into
  accommodation has not been spent, while thousands of them face homelessness.
  Freedom of information requests to 150 councils in England, shared with the
  Guardian, identified that £327m – about a third of the £1bn budget – was still
  sitting in council bank accounts more than three years after Russia invaded
  Ukraine. Most of the funds councils have spent have been used to pay staff and
  partner organisations. Only £22m has been spent on temporary accommodation for
  Ukrainians and £15m to help them into private rented accommodation. Many
  Ukrainians struggle to find accommodation in the private rented sector because
  of the need to provide a deposit, something councils can help with but which
  some Ukrainians say in practice can be slow, bureaucratic and difficult to
  access. Finding a UK guarantor can also be difficult and those unable to speak
  English struggle to negotiate with landlords. British Red Cross research
  earlier this year found that Ukrainian refugees were more than twice as likely
  as British people to experience homelessness. Using data from across Britain,
  the Red Cross research estimates that more than 6,400 Ukrainian families will
  experience some form of homelessness this year. Baljeet Nijjhar of UKrainian
  Refugee Help, who obtained and collated the FoI data, said: “Local councils
  are allocated thousands of pounds per Ukrainian arrival, yet the guests we
  support seem to struggle to access this directly when in need. “The most
  common issue is inability to rent privately and people often don’t know anyone
  in the UK who could act as a guarantor, so it’s the local council that they
  must rely on here to solve this problem. “Our research shows that many
  councils have significant levels of funds left, but have helped very few
  people to rent, whereas others have demonstrated a ‘can do’, proactive
  approach and have helped significantly more.” She called for targets to be set
  for council spending of government money earmarked for Ukrainians and for
  interventions from Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
  (MHCLG) to get more people into private rented accommodation more quickly.
  Solomiia Baranets, a Ukrainian refugee and trainee lawyer who runs the
  Ukrainian Employment Integration Project to help people find jobs, said she
  had struggled to get housing for herself and her family and was trying to help
  others in the same situation. “The status of Ukrainians here is not stable. I
  have two children and a disabled mother. I contacted more than 50 landlords.
  They were very polite but they never came back to me. The council did not help
  me. I had to help myself.” Stan Beneš, the director of Opora, an organisation
  that supports Ukrainians in rebuilding their lives, said: “The quality of
  council support for Ukrainians is often a postcode lottery. Since the Ukraine
  visa schemes began, councils have had significant discretion over how to use
  government-allocated funds, and whether to top them up from their own budgets.
  “Differences in council structures, resources and priorities across the UK
  have widened the gap. While some Ukrainians still receive a high level of
  support, an ever-growing number are struggling. These barriers are further
  compounded by the trauma of war and forced relocation.” Dr Krish Kandiah, the
  director of the Sanctuary Foundation, which provides support for Ukrainian
  refugees, praised the British public for their hospitality. “It is now vital
  that the UK builds on that generosity by ensuring that every Ukrainian has the
  security and dignity of their own front door,” he said. An MHCLG spokesperson
  said: “Councils are given a set amount of funding per arrival and it’s not
  unusual for this to be spent over the duration of their time in the UK rather
  than all at once. Ultimately councils are best placed to understand the needs
  of their local communities and explain how this money is spent.”
