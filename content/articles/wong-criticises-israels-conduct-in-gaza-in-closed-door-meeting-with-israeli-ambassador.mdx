  In a private meeting with Israel’s ambassador to Australia, the foreign
  affairs minister, Penny Wong, criticised Israel’s conduct in Gaza and called
  for it to urgently comply with international law and increase the supply of
  food to Palestinians. Wong’s Thursday meeting with Amir Maimon was requested
  by the Israeli embassy, according to federal government sources, and took
  place inside Wong’s office at Parliament House in Canberra. The meeting was
  held days after Australia joined 27 other countries in condemning Israel for
  denying humanitarian aid to Palestinians. At the time, Wong said the decision
  to sign the statement reflected the “concern” and “distress” Australians felt
  from seeing the images of starving Palestinians in Gaza. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The Thursday discussion followed another meeting between Maimon and
  lower-level foreign affairs officials in Canberra earlier in the week, as
  reported by the Nine Newspapers. Australian sources said Wong repeated her
  public criticism of Israel’s conduct in Gaza during the meeting with Maimon.
  This included a request for Israel to comply with international law and ensure
  enough food was being provided to Palestinians. Wong’s office declined to
  comment on the meeting, and the Israeli embassy has been contacted for
  comment. Before both meetings took place, the prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, accused Israel of “clearly” breaching international law and said
  Benjamin Netanyahu’s government was “losing support” internationally. After
  those comments, Wong said: “It is forbidden to withhold aid from civilians,
  that is not consistent with international law, but actually, just as
  importantly, it’s morally the wrong thing to do.” Earlier in the week, a
  select group of journalists attended a briefing at the Israeli embassy where
  Israel’s deputy ambassador, Amir Meron, reportedly said: “We don’t recognise
  any famine or any starvation in the Gaza Strip.” In response, Albanese said
  that statement was “beyond comprehension” and raised concerns about Israel
  restricting journalists from visiting the war-torn Palestinian territory.
  Dozens of Palestinians have died of hunger in recent weeks in a crisis
  attributed by the UN and other humanitarian organisations to Israel’s blockade
  of almost all aid into the territory. Two Israeli-based rights groups this
  week declared that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, with reports citing
  evidence including the weaponisation of hunger. B’tselem described an
  “official and openly declared policy” of mass starvation. On Wednesday,
  Australia joined 14 other countries in describing the recognition of Palestine
  as “an essential step towards the two-state solution”, linking progress on
  statehood to the upcoming United Nations general assembly meeting in
  September. But Albanese also criticised calls for further actions against
  Israel as “slogans” as he faced intensifying pressure from his MPs, Labor
  members and the Greens to reconsider his position on the war and humanitarian
  crisis in Gaza. He has so far stopped short of matching his UK counterpart
  Keir Starmer’s promise to recognise the state of Palestine in September unless
  Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a two-state solution. “What I’ve
  said is that it’s not the timeline, that’s not what we’re looking at. What
  we’re looking at is the circumstances where recognition will advance the
  objective of the creation of two states,” Albanese said on Wednesday, a day
  before Wong met Maimon.
