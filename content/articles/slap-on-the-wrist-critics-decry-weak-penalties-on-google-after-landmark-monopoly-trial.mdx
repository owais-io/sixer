  monopoly trial

  A judge ruled on Tuesday that Google would not be forced to sell its Chrome
  browser or the Android operating system, saving the tech giant from the most
  severe penalties sought by the US government. The same judge had ruled in
  favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and
  maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine. Groups
  critical of Google’s dominance in the internet search and online advertising
  industry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity to enact
  meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the crushing weight
  of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by contrast, are
  thrilled. Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have risen 9% since
  Tuesday afternoon. Judge Amit Mehta did order Google to share data from its
  search engine with its rivals. He also enjoined the company from entering or
  maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of its products
  including Chrome, Google Assistant and the Gemini app. That penalty will not,
  however, prevent it from paying distributors such as Apple and Mozilla, which
  use Google as the default search engine for their respective browsers. Google
  faces a separate hearing later this year on its monopoly over online
  advertising technology. The Department of Justice celebrated the ruling in a
  Tuesday press release that called Mehta’s proposed remedies “significant”.
  “The court’s ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open
  the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for
  over a decade,” the announcement reads. It’s not enough, say free market
  advocates. Critics say judge handed Google a lenient win Mehta’s decision
  resulted in an immediate wave of backlash from big tech critics who have been
  closely following the antitrust case for years. Many of these thinktanks and
  advocacy groups had long called for Google to be broken up for its
  monopolistic tactics, arguing that forceful action was needed to restore
  meaningful competition. Instead of opening up the online search industry,
  however, critics of the ruling allege that it will now retrench Google’s
  dominance while setting a precedent that big tech need not fear serious
  consequences for breaking the law. “Google for years has wielded its vast
  power over all layers of the digital economy to crush competitors, halt
  innovation and rob Americans of their right to read, watch and buy what they
  want without being manipulated by one of the most powerful corporations in
  human history,” Barry Lynn, executive director at the Open Markets Institute
  thinktank, said. “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with
  competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right
  those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that
  even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the
  wrist.” Some groups and experts took issue with how Mehta’s ruling that Google
  had illegally maintained a monopoly could result in the more lenient decision
  handed down this week. “You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and
  then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde,
  executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project non-profit.
  Several tech leaders, including the CEOs of Yelp, search engine DuckDuckGo and
  Epic Games, additionally condemned the decision for failing to adequately
  level the playing field for competitors. Yelp and Epic Games have both sued
  Google over antitrust issues, while DuckDuckGo’s CEO testified in the
  government’s antitrust trial against the search giant. “It’s like a defendant
  robbed a series of banks and the court verdict found them guilty, then
  sentenced them to probation under which they may continue robbing banks but
  must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers,” Tim
  Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, posted on X in yet another use of a bank robbing
  analogy. Democratic lawmakers who have urged for stronger regulations on big
  tech similarly denounced the ruling, in some cases calling for the justice
  department to appeal the decision. “The court previously ruled that Google’s
  search business is an illegal monopoly, but now the judge’s remedies fail to
  hold Google accountable for breaking the law,” the Massachusetts senator
  Elizabeth Warren said in a statement. “Instead of restoring competition and
  ending Google’s dominance, this ruling is a slap on the wrist for unlawful
  behavior that warranted the breakup of this tech giant.” The chairs of the
  Monopoly Busters caucus – US representatives Chris Deluzio, Pramila Jayapal,
  Pat Ryan and Angie Craig – also issued a statement calling the decision a
  “slap on the wrist” and alleging it undermines bipartisan efforts to rein in
  tech monopolies. “In practice, this ruling allows Google to stay a monopoly.
  Despite finding Google guilty of search monopolization, the court is allowing
  the company to retain Chrome and Android, key tools that Google uses to
  dominate the market,” the caucus said. The decision also drew the ire of human
  rights group Amnesty International, which said that Google’s business model is
  built on “pervasive surveillance” and that Chrome is an important tool used
  for harvesting the personal data of Google users. “Forcing Google to break up
  its search business and sell Chrome could have marked a first step toward a
  digital world that respects our rights,” said Agnès Callamard, secretary
  general of Amnesty International. Silicon Valley and Wall Street cheer While
  trustbusters lamented the ruling, the tech industry cheered. Industry groups
  weighed in saying Mehta’s decision avoided calamitous results for Silicon
  Valley. The Developers Alliance, a tech industry group, said it was pleased
  that the judge “rejected the draconian structural remedies” that the justice
  department had requested in the case. “Divesting Chrome and Android would have
  had disastrous consequences for web and app developers and the broader digital
  ecosystem,” the group said in a statement. “Developers are relieved that the
  political theater of this trial has ended.” Another industry group, the
  Consumer Choice Center, invoked Google’s arguments from the trial in which the
  search engine giant said it had the best product and that is why it dominates
  the market. Stephen Kent, the group’s media director, said the justice
  department’s “politicized case” held “larger players in contempt for having
  superior products that people freely use instead of rival apps and services”.
  Many of these groups cited Mehta’s argument that in the year or so since he
  originally ruled that Google’s search business was monopolistic, the
  burgeoning AI space has produced both financially and technologically viable
  competitors to Chrome for the first time in years. “These new realities give
  the court hope that Google will not simply outbid competitors for distribution
  if superior competitors emerge,” Mehta’s ruling read. “Arguing about search
  engine market share when dramatic and remarkable advances in AI were upending
  the industry was head-scratching at best,” the Developers Alliance said.
  Jennifer Huddleston, senior fellow at libertarian thinktank the Cato
  Institute, said the courts should proceed with caution and “recognize that
  innovation often remains our best competition policy” when attempting to rule
  on antitrust cases. “The months that have passed between the initial ruling
  and the remedies decision have shown how rapidly markets in the tech sector
  can change,” Hiddleston said in a statement. “This is particularly true in the
  present, given the disruptive nature of AI products in search. As Judge
  Mehta’s decision notes, such cases ask courts to predict the future of a
  rapidly changing market rather than merely look at historical facts, as it
  typically does, and that doing such is not a judge’s forte.” As Google’s stock
  bounced on the news of Mehta’s ruling, Apple also saw a boost. The iPhone
  maker historically received billions of dollars from Google annually to make
  Google Search the default engine on its phones and tablets. The deal between
  the two companies amounted to about 15% of Apple’s operating income. Its
  shares rose nearly 4% since Tuesday. “Apple also gets a nice win because the
  ruling forces Google to renegotiate the search deal annually,” Gene Munster,
  managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote on X. Critics of the
  remedies ruling were not surprised by Wall Street heralding Mehta’s decision
  as a win. “There’s a reason Google’s stock jumped after this ruling was
  released,” said Christo Wilson, a Northeastern University computer science
  professor who has conducted research on Google’s monopoly. “It is a historic
  misfire that fails to meet the enormity of the finding that Google is a
  monopolist in online search.”
