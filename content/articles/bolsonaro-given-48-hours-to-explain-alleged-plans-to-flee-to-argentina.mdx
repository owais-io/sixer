  A supreme court judge has given Brazil’s ex-president, Jair Bolsonaro, 48
  hours to explain police claims he was planning to flee to Argentina to avoid
  punishment for allegedly masterminding a failed coup after losing the 2022
  election. Bolsonaro’s trial for the alleged attempt to seize power is
  scheduled to conclude early next month. The far-right populist faces more than
  four decades in prison if found guilty. Court documents made public on
  Wednesday night showed federal police investigators had found a draft asylum
  request on the ex-president’s mobile phone addressed to Argentina’s rightwing
  president, Javier Milei. In the undated and unsigned document, Bolsonaro
  claimed he was “facing imminent arrest” for political motives and needed
  “urgent” sanctuary overseas. An Argentinian government source told the Reuters
  news agency that Milei’s office had not received a letter. But Brazilian
  police claimed the document indicated Bolsonaro had “planned to flee the
  country, in order to prevent the law being enforced”. After the document was
  released as part of a 170-page police report, supreme court justice Alexandre
  de Moraes demanded answers from Bolsonaro’s lawyers. “The evidence gathered by
  the federal police indicate that Jair Messias Bolsonaro was in possession of a
  document designed to enable him to escape national territory,” Moraes wrote in
  his dispatch. Bolsonaro, who was president from 2019 until the end of 2022,
  was placed under house arrest in early August after the supreme court decided
  he had violated a court order banning him from using social media. But
  Moraes’s 48-hour ultimatum reportedly fuelled fears among Bolsonaro supporters
  that their 70-year-old leader could be now taken into custody to stop him
  absconding before his final judgment, which is due to start on 2 September and
  conclude on 12 September. Bolsonaro’s lawyer, Paulo da Cunha Bueno, admitted
  that the idea of going to Argentina had been suggested to his client but that
  Bolsonaro had rejected it. “Fleeing was never an option,” he told journalists.
  Bolsonaro stands accused of plotting to overturn the result of the 2022
  election, which he lost to his leftwing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He
  denies those charges, but political and legal experts – and many of
  Bolsonaro’s allies – are convinced he will be convicted. The accusation that
  Bolsonaro had planned to flee Brazil for Argentina came as federal police
  formally accused the ex-president and his congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro,
  of trying to interfere in Bolsonaro’s judgment by encouraging US officials to
  put pressure on the supreme court. If found guilty of that offence they could
  receive a sentence of up to 12 years. Eduardo Bolsonaro moved to the US in
  February and has spent recent months lobbying Donald Trump’s administration –
  with some success – to pile pressure on Brazil’s supreme court justices and
  Lula’s government over his father’s trial. In July Trump slapped 50% tariffs
  on Brazilian imports in retaliation for what he called a “witch-hunt” against
  Bolsonaro and announced the imposition of sanctions on Moraes, who is
  presiding over Bolsonaro’s trial. Eight of Brazil’s 11 supreme court judges,
  including Moraes, have been stripped of their US visas, as have the wife and
  10-year-old daughter of one of Lula’s closest allies, the health minister,
  Alexandre Padilha. “It’s really a political execution that they’re trying to
  do with Bolsonaro. I think that’s terrible,” Trump told reporters last week.
  In other developments during a dramatic 24 hours for Brazilian politics, Silas
  Malafaia, a powerful and wealthy evangelical pastor who is one of Bolsonaro’s
  most vocal cheerleaders, was questioned by police after flying back from
  Portugal to Rio. Malafaia, who is also being investigated by federal police
  over suspicions he too tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial,
  has now been banned from leaving the country and communicating with Bolsonaro
  and his son and has been ordered to surrender his passports. “You’ll have to
  arrest me to silence me,” Malafaia shouted at reporters after being released.
  The federal police report also exposed the foul-mouthed infighting that
  appears to be playing out between members of the Bolsonaro clan and key
  supporters in the lead-up to the ex-president’s judgment. In one WhatsApp
  exchange found on Jair Bolsonaro’s phone, which was seized as part of police
  investigations, Eduardo Bolsonaro reacts to an interview in which his father
  criticised him, writing in all capitals: “Go and fuck yourself you fucking
  ingrate!” In another message, from Malafaia to Jair Bolsonaro, the firebrand
  church leader attacks Eduardo Bolsonaro for publicly celebrating Trump’s
  tariffs on Brazilian imports. “I’m sorry, president. This son of yours Eduardo
  is an inexperienced prick who is handing the nationalist discourse to Lula and
  the left … a complete idiot. I’m fuming!” In a statement, Eduardo Bolsonaro
  criticised the police for “leaking private, absolutely normal conversations”.
  He called the move “shameful” and politically motivated and denied trying to
  interfere in his father’s trial. Polls suggest Lula has received a boost after
  Trump’s attempts to pressure Brazil’s institutions, with more than 70% of
  Brazilians opposed to the US president’s actions and only 21% supporting them.
  A poll released on Thursday showed Lula beating all of his potential rightwing
  rivals in next year’s election, including Bolsonaro’s wife, Michelle
  Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and a handful of conservative state governors
  battling to inherit leadership of Bolsonaro’s political movement.
