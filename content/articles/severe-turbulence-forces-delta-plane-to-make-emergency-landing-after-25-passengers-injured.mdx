  At least 25 people were injured in a severe case of turbulence that forced a
  Delta Air Lines jet flying to Amsterdam into an emergency landing in
  Minneapolis, the airline said in a statement. The flight had taken off from
  Salt Lake City in Utah but landed at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul international
  airport after “significant turbulence” struck. “Medical personnel met the
  flight upon arrival to evaluate customers and crew. Twenty-five of those on
  board were transported to local hospitals for evaluation and care,” Delta said
  in a statement. “We are grateful for the support of all emergency responders
  involved.” William Webster, one of the passengers on board the stricken
  flight, told CNN it was “the craziest turbulence I’ve ever seen in my life”.
  “I felt the centrifugal force. I was off my seat for like 30 seconds with the
  turbulence,” he said in an interview with the network. The turbulence hit as a
  meal was being served, adding to the dangers to those onboard. “I watched a
  wine cart just get thrown into the air,” Webster added. Turbulence has long
  been a problem for air travelers, but experts say the issue is getting worse
  in an era of climate crisis which produces more extreme atmospheric
  conditions. “We can expect a doubling or tripling in the amount of severe
  turbulence around the world in the next few decades,” Paul Williams, an
  atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading, told the BBC. The BBC
  reported that National Transportation Safety Board figures show that in the US
  alone, there have been 207 severe injuries since 2009. Severe injuries are
  defined as when an individual has been admitted to hospital for more than 48
  hours.
