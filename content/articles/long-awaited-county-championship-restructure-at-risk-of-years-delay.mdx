  The long-awaited restructure of the County Championship could be delayed by
  another 12 months after a crucial meeting of club chairs broke up on Wednesday
  without resolution. With no consensus emerging following the summit at Lord’s,
  a planned vote on a proposal to cut the Championship to 13 matches next season
  has been put on hold, leaving the entire restructure in doubt. The counties
  agreed to cut the Twenty20 Blast from 14 matches to 12 earlier this season
  following recommendations of the players union, the Professional Cricketers’
  Association, but their call to trim the Championship has proved more difficult
  to execute. Four proposed new structures from the current 10/8 divisional
  split had already been rejected before the meeting, when a convoluted
  compromise that would involve most counties playing 13 Championship games from
  next season also failed to win sufficient support. In the model discussed on
  Wednesday, a 12-team County Championship Division One would be split into two
  pools of six, with the remaining six clubs in Division Two. At least 12 out of
  18 counties must vote in favour to alter the structure of the Championship,
  which has led to a standoff. Surrey, Yorkshire, Middlesex, Essex and Somerset
  have publicly stated they will oppose any reduction to the 14-game season,
  while Derbyshire, Sussex and Kent are also yet to be convinced by the various
  alternatives offered to the status quo. The 10-strong advocates of a
  restructure are equally reluctant to back down, however, which led to more
  informal discussions between the counties on Wednesday over whether any of the
  previously rejected models can be revived. Those include three conferences of
  six, a single 18-team league with a Champions League-style Swiss-model fixture
  list, a midseason split similar to that of the Scottish Premier League, as
  well as several different variants of the current 10/8 divisional makeup. With
  83% of players in a survey last year expressing concern over their physical
  wellbeing because of the volume of domestic cricket played, the PCA will
  continue to lobby hard for a cut. The possibility of a players’ strike has
  been mooted by some of the unhappy county executives, although that dramatic
  course of action has yet to be discussed in any detail. With just three rounds
  of the County Championship this season remaining, beginning next week, the
  most likely outcome is a further delay with the vote taking place during the
  winter if an agreement cannot be reached before then. The PCA has not given up
  of persuading enough counties to change their position in time to for a
  positive vote this month, however.
