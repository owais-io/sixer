  For decades, they have languished in storage in the basement of a museum in
  the English West Country. Finally, an extraordinary collection of weapons and
  ceremonial objects taken from the Larrakia people more than a century ago is
  beginning a winding journey home to the saltwater landscapes of the Northern
  Territory in Australia. During an emotionally charged ceremony, Bristol city
  council formally handed over 33 objects including spears that would have been
  used to hunt creatures from fish to buffalo, some still gleaming with the red
  ochre used to decorate them. They will be flown to Melbourne and then taken by
  truck to Garramilla/Darwin – road is the only option because at three metres
  some of the spears are too long to be transported on a domestic flight – and
  the plan is to show them at the Larrakia cultural centre, which is scheduled
  to open on a site overlooking Darwin harbour next year. “It’s a good day, very
  important,” said Nigel Browne, a Larrakia and Wulna man who was in Bristol to
  receive the objects. “This is the end of a four-year journey. To see the
  return of these cultural objects that were taken from Larrakia is very
  significant. They are the tools of our trade as ancient huntsmen, fishermen.
  They have been gone a long time. “They’ll be used not only to admire back
  home, but also teach a new generation of Larrakia how to craft spears that our
  ancestors were very adept at making. It’s not just about the past here. It’s
  about the future, teaching the next generation about their heritage.” Browne
  said museums across Australia and around the world held hundreds of such
  objects: “That’s the same for many different groups, not just Larrakia.
  Objects were taken over many years.” He said other institutions should look at
  what Bristol had done: “It puts them in a leading role internationally and can
  be used as an example as to what good can happen.” Some of the objects could
  be photographed while others were kept hidden beneath tissue paper. Browne
  said: “Some of the objects we call secret and sacred and were used for
  ceremony.” The ones from Bristol can only be handled by men. The objects were
  collected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and donated to the museum.
  The earliest is a collection of spears, a spear thrower and a club donated by
  a Mr R Cuff in 1881. Nothing more is known of him. Marlborough College in
  Wiltshire donated five spears in 1934. Five years later, spears and spear
  throwers were donated by a relative of an English botanist who had “acquired”
  them while working in Darwin. Some were put on display in Bristol for a while,
  but all have been in storage for at least half a century. Mikayla Lee, a
  Larrakia woman and a member of the advisory group for the Larrakia cultural
  centre, described the recovery of the objects as overwhelming. “It’s very
  moving, emotional, a special moment,” she said. The handover took place in the
  museum’s Wills Hall, named after the family who made a fortune out of tobacco
  and whose financial success benefited from slavery. Close by were artefacts
  taken from Nigeria and China, and the council said it would continue to work
  on repatriations of objects taken by British colonialists. The leader of the
  council, Tony Dyer, said he was proud of the work that had been done with the
  Larrakia people and that other objects may be repatriated to other countries.
  “I think there is much for us to learn from this and much to share with
  others,” he said. Some Larrakia people who could not make it to Bristol had
  sent moving reactions to images they had been shown of the pieces. “That’s a
  fishing spear. That’s really old that style,” said Roque Lee, a Larrakia man.
  “You don’t see that sort of spear now days. I’ve been to the National Museum
  in Canberra and looked at all the Larrakia objects, but there’s nothing like
  this. That’s great.”
