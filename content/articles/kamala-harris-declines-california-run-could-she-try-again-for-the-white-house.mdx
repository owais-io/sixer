  Following a devastating loss to Donald Trump, Kamala Harris returned home to
  California in January with a decision to make about her political future: to
  enter the race for governor, or not. As she deliberated privately, the
  Democratic party was grappling publicly with a new political reality – one
  entirely reshaped by her defeat in last year’s presidential election. Approval
  ratings for the Democratic party had cratered. Grassroots frustration with
  their party’s status quo swelled. And calls grew louder for Democratic
  officials to take a more combative – and urgent – stance against what many see
  as the Trump administration’s authoritarian threat. On Wednesday, when Harris
  announced that she would not run for governor of California, she also made
  clear that she had been listening. “I have extraordinary admiration and
  respect for those who dedicate their lives to public service – service to
  their communities and to our nation,” she said. “At the same time, we must
  recognize that our politics, our government and our institutions have too
  often failed the American people, culminating in this moment of crisis.”
  Harris continued: “As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change
  through new methods and fresh thinking – committed to our same values and
  principles, but not bound by the same playbook.” It was a striking
  acknowledgment from the 2024 Democratic flag-bearer, suggesting a willingness
  to challenge party orthodoxy that critics says cost Democrats in November.
  Before leaving the White House, Harris has been in elected office for more
  than two decades, breaking racial and gender barriers as she ascended from
  district attorney in San Francisco to attorney general of California before
  serving as US senator and then the vice-president of the United States. Polls
  suggested Harris would have entered the gubernatorial race with an early lead
  over many of the lesser-known aspirants who have already declared their
  candidacies. The field is currently dominated by current and past election
  officials, including Xavier Becerra, the former attorney general of
  California, who served with Harris in Biden’s cabinet as the secretary of
  health and human services; Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Democratic mayor
  of Los Angeles; the state’s lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, who is
  close friends with Harris; former representative Katie Porter; and the
  California superintendent of public instruction Tony Thurmond. Harris’s
  decision throws open the race for California’s governorship, a post seen as a
  critical bulwark against Trump’s agenda. It also leaves open the possibility
  that Harris could run again for political office. She did not rule out another
  run for the White House, saying only that “for now, my leadership – and public
  service – will not be in elected office”. A person familiar with her thinking
  said 2028 was not an overriding factor in her decision. While Harris, 60,
  remains one of the most recognizable figures in American politics, with a deep
  fanbase and a broad fundraising network, she would have to persuade Democrats
  that, despite her 2024 loss, she was the best choice to lead the party into
  the post-Trump era. Many in her party are eager to put the 2024 campaign
  behind them while some ambitious Democrats are already looking ahead to 2028,
  among them, Gavin Newsom, the term-limited California governor, and Tim Walz,
  the Minnesota governor who was Harris’s running mate during their 100-plus day
  campaign last year. Allies say declining to run for governor creates space for
  Harris to engage in political and policy debates without the constraints of a
  formal campaign. She has explored other options, such as starting a non-profit
  or leading a policy thinktank, according to the person familiar with her
  thinking. On Thursday, Harris announced that she would release a memoir about
  her historic, truncated presidential campaign, titled 107 Days, to be
  published by Simon &amp; Schuster on 23 September. A book tour will allow
  Harris to travel and remain in the national conversation. The California
  congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, one of the Democrats Harris spoke with in
  recent months as she weighed a run for governor, said the vice-president would
  probably “lean hard” into helping Democrats win back seats in next year’s
  congressional midterm elections. Winning back the House is seen as the party’s
  best chance at blunting Trump’s agenda and allies say Democrats will be eager
  to appear alongside Harris on the campaign trail, as they try to reconnect
  with young voters and communities of color, two blocs the party has struggled
  to mobilize in recent years. Kamlager-Dove said Harris was likely to continue
  working to engage young voters, one of her priorities as vice-president. Days
  before her announcement, Harris delivered virtual remarks at the Voters of
  Tomorrow summit, in which she said the US should “invest” in Gen Z the way the
  US invested in the so-called “greatest generation” after the second world war.
  Calling Gen Z a generation that has “grown up on the frontlines of so many
  crises,” she urged them to “keep challenging the status quo”. Whatever role
  Harris takes on next, her decision signals an intent to become a more central
  figure in the effort to rebuild her fractured party. And in embracing the
  growing consensus among Democrats that the old playbook is no longer fit for
  purpose, she may find herself uniquely positioned to help shape the next one.
  In one of her conversations with Harris, Kamlager-Dove said the vice-president
  conveyed that this was a moment to “color outside of the line”. “You will have
  to be a maverick,” she said, recalling Harris’s comments earlier this year.
  “You may have to be unconventional in some of your approaches, because there
  are forces out there that are working to make us sicker, make us poorer, make
  us less safe, and we need as many people on the frontlines as possible.”
