  Walter Benjamin, the great German theorist of early 20th-century modernity,
  was famously unimpressed by art nouveau. Dismissive of the style’s dreamy
  aesthetic and flowery taste for designs inspired by the natural world, he
  described it as “the last sortie of an art besieged in its tower by
  technology”. An artistic movement embodying a reaction against the mass
  production of the industrial age deserved a more sympathetic reception.
  Nevertheless, the 20th century appeared to agree with Benjamin’s analysis. By
  the end of the first world war, art nouveau’s decorative curlicues and flowing
  forms had fallen out of fashion as a more machine-inspired modernist aesthetic
  came into vogue. But that was then. More than a century on, as artificial
  intelligence offers a fresh tech challenge to humanity, a timely spot of
  revisionism appears to be taking place. Last month, in Paris, it emerged that
  a museum is finally to be dedicated to one of art nouveau’s most deserving and
  neglected exponents. During the early 1900s, the architect Hector Guimard
  designed 167 entrances to the city’s new Métro, one of which was later to be
  donated to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The stylised lettering and
  sinuous green ironwork, resembling insects’ wings or orchid stalks, quickly
  became synonymous both with art nouveau and with Paris itself. But despite
  their much-loved and emblematic status, almost half were bulldozed in an
  ill-advised wave of modernisation. Much of the rest of Guimard’s work in the
  city has been treated with equal disdain. With good reason, the art
  enthusiasts who have lobbied for the new museum for years see it as the
  historic “righting of a wrong”. Meanwhile, 200 miles away in the birthplace of
  art nouveau, more rehabilitation work has been taking place. As part of a
  spectacular new exhibition, Brussels’ Art and History Museum this summer
  unveiled a restored version of Victor Horta’s famous Winter Garden, an
  immersive stained-glass marvel that helped make the artist’s name when it was
  designed in 1900. This too became a victim of postwar architectural
  aesthetics, unceremoniously dismantled as part of a wider urban development
  programme. A six-year process of reconstruction has salvaged much of the
  original and replicated the rest. And completing what might be viewed as an
  upliftingly revivalist year, the work of Alphonse Mucha – best known for his
  poster portraits of the Parisian actor Sarah Bernhardt – is now being
  showcased at a new Mucha museum in Prague. In the US, a recent exhibition has
  also highlighted his influence on the psychedelic art of the 1960s
  counterculture. Benjamin might have raised a sceptical eyebrow. But art
  nouveau’s emphasis on the importance of craftsmanship, and the conviction that
  artistic originality can introduce beauty as well as utility into the objects
  of daily life, are principles with a strong echo of William Morris’s work.
  They are energising doctrines to recall in a new age of existential anxiety.
  Year by year, concerns grow over the extent to which artificial intelligence
  will colonise creative processes that once defined the meaning of being human.
  Guimard’s stunningly innovative Métro entrances remain a tourist attraction in
  their own right, and a tribute to the power of the free imagination. The
  Guimard and Mucha museums, and Horta’s rebuilt Winter Garden, can serve as
  reminders of what must be protected, as we enter our own equivalent of a new
  industrial age. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
