  Going out: Cinema Eddington Out now From Hereditary to Beau Is Afraid, Ari
  Aster’s films are always an event. They’re also an acquired taste, with this
  neo-western about a hotly contested mayoral election set during the pandemic
  in New Mexico dividing critics. It stars Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Austin
  Butler and Emma Stone. The Life of Chuck Out now Based on a Stephen King
  novella, this fantasy drama centres on Charles “Chuck” Krantz (played by
  different actors at different ages, including Tom Hiddleston in middle age),
  an accountant who loves to dance and whose image begins to appear on
  billboards and in adverts, as society experiences environmental and
  technological breakdowns. Sorry, Baby Out now Literature professor Agnes (Eva
  Victor, who also wrote and directed) works at a college in rural New England
  in this dark comedy. The imminent birth of their best friend’s child causes
  them to reflect on their time at the university as a student, which involves
  both happy and traumatic memories. Put Your Hand on Your Soul and Walk Out now
  In Iranian documentary-maker Sepideh Farsi’s depiction of life in Gaza,
  Palestinian photojournalist Fatima Hassouna shares the daily horrors and hopes
  of her people. Hassouna was killed by Israeli air strikes the day after the
  film was accepted into the Cannes film festival. Catherine Bray * * * Going
  out: Gigs Louis Moholo-Moholo Memorial Concert 100 Club, London, 27 August The
  great South African drummer and bandleader Louis Moholo-Moholo died in Cape
  Town on 13 June. Contemporary jazz stars including Evan Parker, Jason Yarde,
  Shabaka Hutchings and Claude Deppa join many others for this special memorial.
  John Fordham Suki Waterhouse London, 25 &amp; 26 August; Belfast, 29 August
  Suki Waterhouse takes her blend of lo-fi pop and 80s indie rock on the road in
  support of last year’s Memoir of a Sparklemuffin album. With a recent deluxe
  rerelease adding 12 songs to the original’s 18, expect a veritable platter of
  sophisticated emotional bloodletting. Michael Cragg Bartees Strange Manchester
  25 August; Southampton, 26 August; London, 27 August Mischievous when it comes
  to genre, having touched on Auto-Tuned rap, emo, indie and acoustic
  strumalongs across his three albums, Strange also brings that energy to the
  stage. This tour follows February’s album, Horror, co-produced by Jack
  Antonoff. MC Royal Concertgebouw &amp; Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestras Royal
  Albert Hall, London, 23, 24 &amp; 26 August Two of Europe’s finest orchestras
  visit this year’s Proms. With chief conductor-designate Klaus Mäkelä, the
  Royal Concertgebouw play Berio and Mahler (Sat), and Mozart, Prokofiev and
  Bartók (Sun), while Andris Nelsons conducts the Leipzig Gewandhaus in Dvořák
  and Sibelius (Tue). Andrew Clements * * * Going out: Art Anna Boghiguian
  Turner Contemporary, Margate, to 26 October The history of the seas resurfaces
  like a sinister wreck in this gallery beside Margate beach. The place of the
  oceans in global trade, colonialism and enslavement is evoked by a raucous
  installation that includes broken wooden boats as well as sand, painted maps
  and a gallery of cutout characters. Dr Esther Mahlangu Serpentine Gallery
  North Garden, London, to 28 September In search of outdoor art to combine with
  a park afternoon in late summer? Make for this mural in the garden of the
  Serpentine Gallery. The acclaimed South African artist Mahlangu mixes
  tradition with modernity, the abstract and symbolic, painting geometric shapes
  that are deeply rooted in Ndebele culture. Emma Critchley Tate St Ives, to 5
  October If you are in St Ives in August you’re probably experiencing the sea
  at its most exciting and enticing, and Critchley’s video and sound
  installation invites you to take a deeper look. Dancers and activists, as well
  as footage of life in the depths, focus attention on the ocean crisis. Jess
  Blandford Southwark Park Galleries, London, to 21 September What makes a good
  abstract painting? It has something to do with believing it is necessary
  rather than willed, that it is meaningful even if you can’t put it into words.
  Jess Blandford’s art has these qualities, as well as fleshy, sensual colours
  and brushstrokes, reminiscent of Willem de Kooning. Jonathan Jones * * * Going
  out: Stage Born With Teeth Wyndham’s theatre, London, to 1 November The
  fractured friendship between Shakespeare and Marlowe is given a fresh spin in
  Liz Duffy Adams’s new play. Directed by Daniel Evans and starring Ncuti Gatwa
  as Marlowe and Edward Bluemel as the Bard. Miriam Gillinson Rachel Kaly
  Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, 23 &amp; 24 August; Soho theatre, London, 26
  to 30 August There’s bleak, trauma-based comedy and then there’s the work of
  New York-raised Kaly, whose show Hospital Hour covers her 300 hospital
  treatments for psychological issues, plus her childhood memories of 9/11 and
  the death of Saddam Hussein. Rachel Aroesti TravFest25 Traverse theatre,
  Edinburgh, to 25 August It’s the final weekend of the Traverse’s juicy
  celebration of new writing, which includes 10 premieres. All plays explore
  current issues – including the climate crisis, radicalisation and the brutal
  impact of dementia. MG Éireann Peacock theatre, London, 28 to 31 August A new
  Irish dance show by A Taste of Ireland, telling the story of Ireland from the
  Vikings to the Easter Rising, via tightly drilled traditional and contemporary
  dance, plus live music. Lyndsey Winship * * * Staying in: Streaming Atomic Sky
  Atlantic &amp; Now, 28 August, 9pm Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones) and Shazad
  Latif (AKA Toast of London’s Clem Fandango) are two chancers who find
  themselves smuggling enriched uranium across north Africa for a cartel in this
  madcap new thriller from Rebus rebooter Gregory Burke. Orange Is the New
  Black’s Samira Wiley plays the CIA officer on their tail. King &amp; Conqueror
  BBC One &amp; iPlayer, 24 August, 9.10pm It’s James Norton’s Harold Godwinson
  versus a pesky Norman known as William the Conqueror (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau)
  in this 1066-set drama. With monikers such as those kicking about, spoiler
  warnings are moot even for the most historically unaware – but there is sure
  to be much tension in the buildup to the king’s fall. Disaster at Sea: The
  Piper Alpha Story BBC Two &amp; iPlayer, 25 August, 9pm As the window between
  disaster and documentary about it becomes increasingly negligible, it’s worth
  appreciating more considered offerings, such as this series about the
  explosions that hit a North Sea oil platform in July 1988 – a story of safety
  failures amid the era’s rush for “black gold”. The Jury: Murder Trial Channel
  4, 26 August, 9pm Members of the public play jurors in a verbatim
  reconstruction of a real murder trial in this Bafta-winning reality show,
  which acted as a damning indictment of our criminal justice system the first
  time round. Series two takes the case of a young mother who stabbed her
  boyfriend. RA * * * Staying in: Games Particle Hearts Out 25 August; PC, PS5,
  Switch, Xbox Series X/S Created by tiny LA studio Underwater Fire, this is a
  sci-fi puzzle adventure with a difference – the planet you must save is
  rendered with visible particles, like an animated Seurat painting. It’s
  visually astonishing. Gears of War: Reloaded Out 26 August; PC, PS5, Xbox
  Series X/S Microsoft’s crunching third-person sci-fi blaster gets the remaster
  treatment – now you can battle to save humanity from the Locust Horde in
  glorious 4K resolution. Squad up with your friends and oil those chainsaw
  guns: there will be blood. Keith Stuart * * * Staying in: Albums Water from
  Your Eyes – It’s a Beautiful Place Out now New York-based Rachel Brown and
  Nate Amos make the kind of playful art-pop that comes with quotes such as “it
  ended up being about time, dinosaurs and space”. The “it” in question is this
  seventh album, which features the gloriously groggy disco of single Playing
  Classics and the spindly indie of Life Signs. Deftones – Private Music Out now
  After a five-year break between albums, and the departure of their bassist,
  experimental alt-rockers Deftones return with more slabs of muscular yet
  beautiful noise. Reunited with producer Nick Raskulinecz, the album’s anchored
  by monumental lead single My Mind Is a Mountain. Mac DeMarco – Guitar Out now
  Canadian singer-songwriter Mac DeMarco seemed to suggest retirement was on the
  horizon following 2023’s slate-clearing One Wayne G, which featured a
  ludicrous 199 songs. Two years later, however, he’s back with this more
  streamlined sixth album, featuring the typically lo-fi but melodically rich
  single Home. Ciara – CiCi Out now Billed as an extension of 2023’s EP of the
  same name, this eighth album from the R&amp;B star features the likes of Busta
  Rhymes, Big Freedia and Latto. But it’s on the solo Ecstasy that the Pucker Up
  hitmaker really shines, gliding over a slinky beat while narrating some
  forthcoming bedroom gymnastics. MC * * * Staying in: Brain food Painting of
  the Week Podcast The longrunning art history series returns for a sixth
  season, producing accessible analyses of works by household names and
  lesser-known artists. Highlights include discussions of a 6,000-year-old bog
  wood carving and a Caravaggio classic. Wild Uplands Online and in Bradford
  Celebrating Bradford’s City of Culture status, four international artists have
  been commissioned to produce site-specific installations for the surrounding
  Penistone Hill moors. This virtual tour takes in the sweeping works of stone,
  fleece and sound. Front Yard Floods BBC World Service, 26 August, 8.06am
  Twenty years on from Hurricane Katrina’s devastation of New Orleans, this
  fascinating documentary follows the neighbourhood initiative building concrete
  “rainwater gardens” to aim to stem the flash flooding caused by sudden
  downpours. Ammar Kalia
