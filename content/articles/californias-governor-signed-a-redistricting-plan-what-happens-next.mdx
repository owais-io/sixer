  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, on Thursday signed a redistricting plan
  and declared a special election to ask voters to change the boundaries of five
  Republican-held congressional districts in the state. The legislative
  manoeuvre is part of a national battle for control of the US House of
  Representatives, and comes as a direct response to developments in Texas. At
  the urging of Donald Trump, lawmakers in the Lone Star state this week
  approved a new congressional map that aims to give Republicans five more US
  House seats. The changes to the district boundaries in California could create
  five new Democratic US House seats, which state Democrats hope will balance
  the scales. “Today was more than drawing lines on a map. It was about drawing
  a line in the sand to stop Texas, to stop Donald Trump from rigging this
  election,” said Mike McGuire, California’s senate president pro tempore, after
  lawmakers approved the package. Here’s what you need to know about what’s
  next: What happened on Thursday? The state’s assembly and senate passed three
  pieces of legislation that comprise the Election Rigging Response Act. The
  package sets the stage for a 4 November special election. The bills are:
  assembly constitutional amendment eight, which allows for the election;
  assembly bill 604, which finalizes Newsom’s proposed maps; and senate bill
  280, providing funding for the election. What do the bills do? In the
  election, Newsom and Democratic leaders will ask voters to temporarily give
  them the power to redraw California’s congressional districts. California
  voters in 2010 gave the power to draw congressional maps to an independent
  commission, with the goal of making the process less partisan. The commission
  last redrew maps following the 2020 census, and the maps were in place for the
  2022 and 2024 US House elections. Newsom and Democratic leaders are asking
  voters to approve their new maps only for the next few elections. They say
  they will return map-drawing power to the commission following the 2030
  census. What happens now? With Newsom’s proposed map and November election
  approved – largely along party lines – Newsom and the state’s Democratic
  leader will shift into campaign mode, the governor told reporters. The goal of
  putting the issue to voters, he added, was to allow Californians to “have the
  opportunity to determine their fate”, Newsom told reporters during a post-vote
  press conference. “You can’t win by playing by the traditional set of rules.
  [Donald Trump] plays by no rules … and we’re responding to that,” he
  continued. Since announcing his redistricting plan, the campaign has raised
  over $6m, Newsom’s team confirmed. Will voters approve it? A recent UC
  Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, conducted for the Los Angeles
  Times, found 46% of respondents agreed Newsom’s redistricting plans were a
  good idea, while 36% said it was a bad idea. Forty-eight per cent said they
  would vote in favor of the plan if it appeared on the ballot. The efforts have
  gained prominent support. This week, Barack Obama called Newsom’s plans “a
  responsible approach” in response to the manoeuvres by Texas and other
  Republican states. Kamala Harris has said she is “proud” of the efforts. Rick
  Caruso, the Los Angeles-based billionaire (who has bounced between the
  Republican and Democratic parties) who unsuccessfully ran for Los Angeles
  mayor in 2024 and has been a vocal critic of the state’s Democratic
  leadership, says that he will also donate to and support the redistricting
  effort, Julia Wick of the LA Times reported. Among the most vocal voices in
  the no-camp is the former Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who
  spearheaded the creation of the independent commission. “I’m not going to go
  back on my promise,” Schwarzenegger told the New York Times last week. “We are
  not going to go into a stinking contest with a skunk. We are moving forward.”
