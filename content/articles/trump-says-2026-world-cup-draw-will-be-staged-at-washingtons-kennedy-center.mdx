  Donald Trump announced Friday that the draw for the 2026 men’s World Cup will
  be held on 5 December at Washington’s Kennedy Center – and suggested he may
  even take part himself. The US president made the announcement in the Oval
  Office alongside Fifa president Gianni Infantino and vice-president JD Vance.
  The ceremony will determine the 12 groups and opening fixtures for the first
  World Cup to feature 48 teams. “It’s the biggest, probably the biggest event
  in sports,” said Trump, 79, wearing a red hat reading: Trump Was Right About
  Everything. Infantino likened the month-long tournament to “104 Super Bowls”,
  prompting Trump to add: “Some of them are bigger than Super Bowls, actually.”
  The 2026 finals will be co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico. The tournament
  begins on 11 June at Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium and ends on 19 July at
  MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Washington is not among the 16 host cities, but
  Trump has turned the Kennedy Center into his personal fiefdom, installing
  himself as chair, replacing its board with loyalists and floating the name
  “Trump-Kennedy Center”. Infantino carried the World Cup trophy into the Oval
  Office, breaking a superstition that only past winners should touch it. “It’s
  for winners only,” he said, before handing it to Trump. The president fumbled
  momentarily before placing it on his desk. “That’s a beautiful piece of gold,”
  Trump said. “Can I keep it?” Infantino later presented him with a giant ticket
  marked Row 1, Seat 1 for the final. Trump also used the event to tout his
  federal crime crackdown in Washington, where he has deployed the National
  Guard and taken control of the city’s police force. “It’s going to be very
  safe,” he said. “Gianni, you can walk down the street with your beautiful wife
  … if you can get a reservation.” Asked if he would draw the team names
  himself, Trump smiled and deferred to Infantino. “It’s a very interesting
  proposal,” the Fifa chief replied. The choice of venue ends months of
  speculation that the draw might land in Las Vegas, which staged the 1994
  ceremony headlined by Stevie Wonder. This time, 42 of the 48 qualifiers will
  be known by December, with the final six decided in playoff matches next
  March. Trump went further, suggesting Russian president Vladimir Putin “wants
  to be there very badly” for the finals, though “it may depend on the outcome
  of peace efforts in Ukraine.” The Republican, who won re-election in 2024, has
  redecorated the Oval Office in gilded tones since returning to power. The
  Kennedy Center, now undergoing a $257m renovation, will double as Fifa’s new
  US headquarters. Trump has called it a showpiece for America’s 250th
  anniversary celebrations next year. Fifa has also expanded its US presence,
  opening offices in Miami and New York’s Trump Tower.
