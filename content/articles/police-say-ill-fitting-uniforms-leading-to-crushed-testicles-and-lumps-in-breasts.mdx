  Musculoskeletal damage, crushed testicles and lumps in breasts are just some
  examples of the harm police officers say they experience because of
  ill-fitting, uncomfortable and low-quality uniforms. Officers responding to
  the first national uniform and equipment survey across all 43 forces in
  England and Wales reported symptoms so severe that some had to have multiple
  operations. Others told how criminals warned them their uniforms left vital
  areas of their body exposed and even acted as a “guide” as to where they could
  be stabbed. Belinda Goodwin, a former frontline officer who works for the
  Police Federation, had two operations to remove fistulas from her breasts that
  she said were caused by ill-fitting body armour. “We had one model and size of
  stab vest for both men and women, and we had to wear them eight to 10 hours a
  day,” she said. “The pressure for women on our breasts was intense; we were
  completely flattened. “Being unable to adjust them for hours on end when you
  were wearing them in a public-facing role was torture. Driving in them was
  horrific and dangerous: they rammed up into your chin. “After my second
  operation, the consultant told me that they couldn’t operate again if the
  fistulas returned because I’d have no breast left to remove. I realised I had
  no choice but to leave frontline policing entirely.” Almost 21,000 police
  officers and staff responded to the survey conducted by Lancaster University
  law school led by Dr Camilla De Camargo and Dr Stephanie Wallace, in
  collaboration with the Police Federation of England and Wales and the National
  Police Chiefs’ Council. One officer said: “The current body armour doesn’t
  seem to provide adequate coverage on officer’s bodies, with large areas,
  including armpit areas, exposed compared to other forces’ vests that feel a
  lot more protective. “On numerous occasions, offenders have commented on how
  exposed our kit leaves us, and state that our kit acts as a target of where to
  be stabbed.” More than 60% of men and 85% of women reported a physical health
  condition that they believed was caused by or made worse through wearing
  uniform. The most commonly worn garments were the most problematic: 61%
  complained about body armour; 69% flagged cargo trousers. The survey also
  found inconsistent uniform quality across forces, with access to
  high-performance kit depending more on local budgets than operational need:
  negative experiences ranged from 29% in North Yorkshire to 75% in nearby South
  Yorkshire. One officer said: “Cargo trousers are too restrictive when
  struggling with suspects. On foot patrol or foot chases, [they] do not allow
  for flexibility to climb, jump or fight as you should.” Another said: “The
  standard fit of the patrol/cargo trousers is not fit for purpose. They are
  extremely tight around the groin/thigh area and often cause rubbing and
  soreness.” But for another officer, the trousers were too loose: “The cargo
  trousers are completely unsuitable for frontline policing – they are baggy and
  dangerous.” The survey also found uniforms did not enable officers to carry
  all their equipment. “The utility vest does not offer enough room to add all
  items that the force requires us to carry,” said one officer. Another said:
  “The utility vest causes horrific back pain as the amount of equipment, and
  weight of that equipment, is too much to all be placed on the front.” When
  officers reported the problems, however, the survey found that their
  complaints were often trivialised and dismissed: almost 40% of officers had
  made a complaint but only 8% received replacement uniform. One force’s female
  members bought their own rather than use their department’s trousers because
  the crotch was too short. “Concerns were raised and women’s health issues were
  not given appropriate consideration by the men deciding what we should wear.
  It was viewed as more of a fashion issue, and anxiety about body image and the
  medical issues, such as thrush, were ignored,” she said. The PFEW is calling
  on the Home Office to create coordinated procurement standards for uniforms
  with a higher minimum national standard. Melissa Russhard, the National Police
  Chiefs’ Council lead for uniform, said: “This survey will help give us the
  mandate to push forward with our moves towards setting national
  standardisation for uniform requirements and end the postcode lottery that
  exists.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “We refer to individual
  police forces, given decisions on uniform are a matter for them.”
