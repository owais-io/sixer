  A powerful earthquake that hit mountainous eastern Afghanistan has left at
  least 800 people confirmed dead and injured about 2,500, Taliban officials
  have said as rescuers struggled to reach the worst-hit villages. The
  magnitude-6 earthquake struck several provinces close to the Pakistan border
  around midnight on Sunday, with the rugged region of Kunar the most severely
  affected. There were landslides and flooding. The earthquake was shallow,
  taking place close to Earth’s surface, which is known to cause greater
  destruction. Several aftershocks were reported throughout the night and into
  Monday morning, which could even be felt in the capital, Kabul, more than 100
  miles away. The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the
  death toll had exceeded 800 by Monday afternoon and that rescue efforts were
  continuing to recover those trapped beneath mud and debris. However, those
  efforts were hampered as roads to affected areas were destroyed or blocked by
  rubble from the earthquake, and the terrain of the region is steep and
  treacherous. The death toll is expected to rise significantly as local
  hospitals reported being inundated with casualties, and hundreds of people
  remain unaccounted for. Medics at the provincial hospital in Asadabad in Kunar
  described the situation as an overwhelming crisis, with new patients arriving
  every few minutes. Rasheed Khan, a 40-year-old cloth merchant in Kabul
  originally from Kunar’s Watpur village, said his wife, children and brothers
  were among the dead. “It’s doomsday for me. I have lost my wife, three
  children and two brothers, and I don’t know what has happened to my other
  relatives and fellow villagers,” he said while returning to his native village
  from the capital. “I fear thousands still remain trapped under the rubble, and
  I don’t know if they will be saved or not,” Khan said. Afghanistan’s defence
  ministry said it had dispatched 30 doctors and truckloads of medicine to Kunar
  to assist local hospitals, according to the state-run Bakhtar news agency. The
  Taliban urged humanitarian organisations to assist with rescue efforts in
  areas that could only be reached by air because of the landslides and
  flooding. Officials emphasised the urgent need for field hospitals, medical
  aid, rescue equipment, shelter, food and clean drinking water. Since the
  Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 and installed a hardline regime
  – including heavy restrictions on women’s employment and education – there has
  been a significant withdrawal of foreign aid and assistance to the country.
  This has pushed the country’s healthcare system to the brink of collapse and
  severely undermined its capacity to respond to disasters. Jeremy Smith, the
  country manager for Afghanistan for the Red Cross, which is taking part in the
  rescue operation, said the remote location of the earthquake made efforts
  particularly challenging. “There have been repeated aftershocks and more are
  feared in the coming days,” he said. Kunar is a poor, mountainous region where
  homes are primarily constructed of mud and rocks. The epicentre of the
  earthquake was close to the bustling trade city of Jalalabad, near the border
  with Pakistan. Swaths of the city’s buildings are low-rise and informal
  constructions, mostly made of concrete and brick, which are particularly
  vulnerable to earthquakes. Muhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar’s Nur Gul
  district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, were killed
  in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the
  rubble. “The poor people in this area have lost everything,” he said. “There
  is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof there are dead
  bodies. The mud houses have been wiped away and destruction is everywhere.
  People are desperately seeking help.” There were reports that some remote
  villages were yet to receive any rescue assistance due to damaged access
  routes. Rescue workers in Nur Gul said a journey usually of two hours to reach
  one village, Masood, was now taking eight while many other villages could be
  accessed only on foot. Nearly everyone in Masood has lost family members, and
  many people are believed trapped under the rubble. Rescue workers said the
  death toll could be as high as 250. In Laghman province, officials reported at
  least 30 injuries, mostly among women. Tremors were also felt in Nuristan, but
  damage assessments there are still pending. The disaster comes with
  Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, already in the midst
  of a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the suspension of US foreign aid
  earlier this year, which has forced hospitals and health clinics to shut down.
  The country is also grappling with the impact of the forced return of more
  than 2 million Afghan nationals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. According
  to the United Nations, more than half of Afghanistan’s 42 million population
  is already in need of humanitarian assistance. China said it was ready to
  provide disaster relief assistance “according to Afghanistan’s needs and
  within its capacity” and India said it had delivered 1,000 family tents to
  Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food material to Kunar, with more to be sent
  from Tuesday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said its mission in
  Afghanistan was preparing to help those in areas devastated by the quake. Pope
  Leo sent condolences for the dead. Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes,
  particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range where the Indian and Eurasian
  tectonic plates meet. A series of earthquakes in its west killed more than
  1,000 people last year. A magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck Afghanistan on 7
  October 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated
  that at least 4,000 people died. The UN gave a far lower death toll of about
  1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent
  memory.
