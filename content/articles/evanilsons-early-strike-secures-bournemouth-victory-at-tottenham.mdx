  Three and easy for Thomas Frank? Well, not quite – this is Tottenham, after
  all. Instead it was Andoni Iraola’s outstanding Bournemouth who ended his 100%
  start thanks to Evanilson’s early strike as familiar failings returned to
  haunt Spurs. Had things turned out differently this summer, Iraola could
  easily have found himself in the home dugout having been coveted by Tottenham
  before they eventually settled on Frank. But after Spurs won Frank’s first two
  Premier League matches since he succeeded Ange Postecoglou, their shortcomings
  were exposed by the Spaniard’s high press and only Bournemouth’s profligacy
  prevented their victory being even more convincing as Tottenham’s players left
  the pitch to a smattering of boos. Xavi Simons, the new £51.8m signing from RB
  Leipzig, was paraded on the pitch beforehand and Frank will be desperate to
  integrate him as quickly as possible after it took until the 69th minute for
  his team to register a shot on target. “Bournemouth played to their strengths
  and we didn’t handle it well enough,” said Frank. “I’d prefer [the supporters]
  not to boo but it was not a good performance and they have high standards.”
  Perhaps unsurprisingly, he had decided against changing a winning formula and
  selected the same side that executed his gameplan to perfection against
  Manchester City last week, even if Dominic Solanke was ruled out with an ankle
  injury that the Spurs manager hopes will not keep him out beyond the
  international break. But he will be concerned by how easily the pedestrian
  midfield trio of João Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Pape Sarr were
  outclassed by Bournemouth’s technical superiority and it wasn’t until Frank
  introduced Lucas Bergvall in the second half that they at least looked more
  threatening. “I liked almost everything we did today,” said Iraola. “You can
  see there is still work to do at the back with the new players but when you
  are getting the results it is easier to correct things.” The visitors were
  also unchanged from the win over Wolves as their new-look defence, marshalled
  by their experienced captain Adam Smith – a product of Tottenham’s academy –
  had come prepared for a thorough examination. However, it was Bournemouth who
  seized the initiative from the very start with a zip to their play that Spurs
  simply couldn’t live with. A day after being handed his first senior England
  call-up, Djed Spence was brought back down to earth inside the first four
  minutes when he was caught out by Marcos Senesi’s through ball and played
  Evanilson onside. The Brazilian’s shot looped off Cristian Romero, over
  Guglielmo Vicario and into the net. Evanilson almost doubled his tally when he
  drilled wide after good work from Antoine Semenyo before the Ghana forward
  headed a sumptuous outside-of-the-boot cross from David Brooks inches over.
  Tottenham could barely get out of their own half and when they did after a
  mistake by Tyler Adams, Richarlison was guilty of gifting possession straight
  back. Even the departure of Smith with an injury just before the half-hour
  mark could not halt Bournemouth’s momentum and it required a last-ditch block
  from Micky van de Ven to keep the deficit at one when Marcus Tavernier was
  played in by Semenyo. Frank even had to gesture for the home supporters to
  calm down when yet another Tottenham attack broke down. But it was hard to
  blame them considering Spurs ended the first half without creating a single
  chance despite having almost 60% of possession. Whatever Frank said at
  half-time didn’t appear to have worked as Bournemouth picked up where they had
  left off. It needed a sharp save from Vicario to deny Semenyo within 60
  seconds of the restart after a lightning quick break before a deflected effort
  from Brooks struck the crossbar when a long throw caused chaos in the
  Tottenham defence. Somehow they remained only 1-0 down after another Vicario
  save from Brooks, with Frank turning to Bergvall and Wilson Odobert from his
  bench. Spence was perhaps lucky to receive only a yellow card when he caught
  Bournemouth substitute Amine Adli late before Vicario gave away possession and
  Tavernier fired into the side netting.Odobert snatched at his chance when the
  ball dropped invitingly at the Frenchman’s feet and he blazed way over. At
  last Tottenham had woken up and a volley from Mathys Tel in injury time that
  missed by a foot would have brought the house down if it had gone in. But
  there was no way back.
