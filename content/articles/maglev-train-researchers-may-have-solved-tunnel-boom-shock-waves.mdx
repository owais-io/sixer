  Researchers hope they may have solved the “tunnel boom” problem as they
  prepare to roll out China’s latest prototype magnetic levitation train. The
  newest version of the maglev train is capable of travelling at 600km/h (about
  370mph). However, the train’s engineers have wrestled with the problem of the
  shock waves that occur as the train exits the mouth of a tunnel. When a
  high-speed train enters an enclosed space such as a tunnel, air in front is
  compressed, like in a piston. The resulting fluctuations in air pressure
  coalesce at the tunnel mouth, generating low-frequency shock waves. These are
  colloquially known as a “tunnel boom” – a related, albeit different phenomenon
  to the “sonic boom” heard as aircraft pass the speed of sound. Tunnel booms
  pose serious challenges to operational safety, as the shock waves can disturb
  humans and animals nearby, as well as causing structural damage. Now, however,
  researchers have discovered that placing innovative soundproofing buffers at
  tunnel mouths can reduce shock waves by up to 96%. This promises improvements
  in operational safety, noise pollution and passenger comfort, as well as
  safeguarding animals in the vicinity of future lines. This was already a well
  documented problem for conventional high-speed trains, which travel at speeds
  of up to 350km/h (217mph), but it worsens significantly for trains travelling
  at even higher speeds because the strength of the shock wave increases rapidly
  and the critical length that gives rise to a tunnel boom drops off quickly.
  For example, a train travelling at 600km/h will lead to a boom in a tunnel
  just 2km (1.2 miles) long, while for conventional high-speed trains this
  happens only in tunnels which are 6km or longer. The porous structure of the
  new 100-metre long buffers, combined with porous coatings on the tunnel body,
  allow the trapped air to escape before the train reaches the tunnel mouth,
  suppressing the boom in the same way as a silencer fitted to a firearm.
  Magnetic levitation refers to the use of magnetic force to suspend a train
  above a guideway or rail, sometimes with a height of only 10mm, by either
  electromagnetic or electrodynamic suspension. The train is then propelled
  using other electromagnets. While conventional high-speed trains are
  ultimately limited in speed due to increased wear and tear of wheels against
  the track, the separation of track and train means that maglevs are not
  subject to the same frictional forces. Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) has
  the train hugging a single steel rail with a U-shaped underside. When
  electromagnets positioned in the U-shape underneath the rail are switched on,
  the train is levitated by the resultant electromagnetic forces. With
  electrodynamic suspension (EDS), the train sits in a U-shaped guideway, with
  superconducting coils embedded in guideway and train. When the power supply is
  switched on, magnetic poles are induced in the coils, leading to a combination
  of repulsive and attractive forces which enable the train to levitate.
  High-speed maglev trains made their debut in 2004 in China, running between
  Pudong airport and the outskirts of Shanghai at 460km/h (286mph), a speed
  record that still holds for rail vehicles in regular commercial service. Built
  using German ‘Transrapid’ technology, this service caters primarily to foreign
  travellers as local people prefer the much cheaper, albeit slower, metro.
  However, this initial hype was soon eclipsed, as subsequent development of
  China’s rail network focused entirely on conventional high-speed rail. The
  national network is now the world’s largest in length at 48,000km (30,000
  miles), with more lines under construction. But maglev trains are now making a
  comeback under the state-owned manufacturer CRRC, which launched the new model
  in 2021. There is no mechanical noise, passengers describing the quiet hum of
  electromagnets and a ride smoother than a conventional train. Although no
  lines have yet been formally planned, it is widely expected that a future line
  will connect the capital, Beijing, with cosmopolitan Shanghai, reducing
  journey times from 4.5 hours to 2.5 hours, about the duration of a domestic
  flight between the two cities. In China, the cost of a high-speed rail ticket
  is cheaper than air travel (¥600 compared with ¥1,200), unlike in many other
  countries. Flights emit on average seven times more CO2 than high-speed rail
  by distance travelled, representing a big potential carbon saving. China is
  not the only place where long-distance high-speed maglevs are on the horizon.
  Japan also has its hopes pinned on the Chuo Shinkansen, which will link its
  two biggest cities of Tokyo and Osaka via Nagoya, cutting through the heart of
  the country. The Tokaido Shinkansen, a conventional high-speed rail line, does
  this journey in 2.5 hours, but it is hoped that the new maglev line travelling
  at 505km/h (314mph) will reduce this to just 67 minutes. It was originally
  scheduled to begin partial service in 2027, but inevitable delays have
  encumbered the project, with a new opening date uncertain.
