  Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to allow
  cryptocurrency and other alternative assets like private equity and real
  estate to be included in the investments in 401(k) retirement accounts. The
  order smooths the way for fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of
  Americans’ retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to
  managers of so-called alternative assets outside stocks, bonds and cash,
  though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement
  investments. Such a move would be a boon for big alternative asset managers by
  opening the $12tn market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution
  plans, to their investments. Trump’s executive order is part of his
  administration’s broader embrace of the cryptocurrency lobby and rollback of
  regulations on digital currencies. Formerly a skeptic about crypto who said
  bitcoin “seemed like a scam”, Trump has this year launched his own lucrative
  cryptocurrency enterprise, courted crypto supporters and promised to make the
  US into the “crypto capital of the world”. “A combination of regulatory
  overreach and encouragement of lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers
  has stifled investment innovation,” Trump said in the order. “My
  Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that
  impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive
  returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable
  retirement.” There is concern among some analysts that allowing cryptocurrency
  to be included in 401(k) contributions carries a high degree of risk, however,
  given that crypto is inherently speculative and in recent years has been the
  subject of rampant fraud. “Opening up the $9tn 401(k) industry to alternative
  assets overall is reasonable, but if these assets and sectors are highly
  speculative and underregulated, it could be a big mistake,” said Anil Khurana,
  executive director of Georgetown University’s Baratta Center for Global
  Business. Trump also issued a separate executive order on Thursday targeting
  the alleged “debanking” of conservatives, promoting a longstanding rightwing
  grievance that banks refused them access to their services on political
  grounds. Prominent Silicon Valley investors took up the issue over the past
  year as part of a push to ease regulatory scrutiny of crypto assets. The order
  on 401(k) contributions directs the labor secretary to consult with her
  counterparts at the treasury department, the Securities and Exchange
  Commission and other federal “regulators to determine whether parallel
  regulatory changes should be made at those agencies”, a White House statement
  said. The new investment options carry lower disclosure requirements and are
  generally less easy to sell quickly for cash than the publicly traded stocks
  and bonds that most retirement funds rely on. Investing in them also tends to
  carry higher fees and, in the case of cryptocurrency, exposes retirees to a
  market known for its volatility. In defined contribution plans, employees make
  contributions to their own retirement account, frequently with a matching
  contribution from their employer. The invested funds belong to the employee,
  but unlike a defined benefit pension plan, there is no guaranteed regular
  payout upon retirement. Whatever changes may come from Trump’s order, it
  likely will not happen overnight, private equity executives say. Plaintiffs’
  lawyers are already preparing for lawsuits that could be filed by investors
  who do not understand the complexity of the new forms of investments. The
  world’s largest asset manager, which lobbied for the change, is not waiting.
  BlackRock plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity
  and private credit assets next year. However, CEO Larry Fink acknowledged in a
  recent call with analysts that the change may not be an immediate boon for the
  industry. “The reality is, though, there is a lot of litigation risk. There’s
  a lot of issues related to the defined contribution business,” Fink said. “And
  this is why the analytics and data are going to be so imperative way beyond
  just the inclusion.” The Department of Labor issued guidance during Trump’s
  previous presidency on how such plans could invest in private equity funds
  within certain limits, but few took advantage, fearing litigation. Proponents
  argue that younger savers can benefit from potentially higher returns on
  riskier investments in funds that get more conservative as they approach
  retirement. Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren wrote in June to the chief
  executive of annuity provider Empower Retirement, which oversees $1.8tn in
  assets for more than 19 million investors, asking how retirement savings
  placed in private investments could be safeguarded “given the sector’s weak
  investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and
  unsubstantiated claims of high returns”.
