  Alexander Isak is close to joining Liverpool after Newcastle accepted a
  British-record £125m fee for the striker. The Sweden international will
  undergo a medical on Monday before signing what is expected to be a six-year,
  £300,000-a-week contract. The deal would end the summer’s longest and most
  acrimonious transfer saga, during which Isak downed tools on Tyneside to force
  a move to the Premier League champions. Liverpool had a £110m bid for the
  25-year-old forward rejected on 1 August. Newcastle’s position at that time
  was that Isak was not for sale, but his subsequent strike and public
  statements allied to their £70m signing of Nick Woltemade and attempts to sign
  either Yoane Wissa or Jørgen Strand Larsen encouraged Liverpool to submit a
  higher offer on Sunday night. Newcastle accepted a fixed fee of £125m with no
  add-ons. A loyalty payment saving on their side means the deal is in effect
  worth £130m to Newcastle. The sum falls short of Newcastle’s £150m valuation
  of the player but still represents a British transfer record and the second
  time this summer that Liverpool have broken their own record. The champions
  paid £100m plus £16m in add-ons for Florian Wirtz in June and the Isak deal
  will take their total summer spending over £440m. Liverpool have recouped more
  than £210m in player sales. Isak in effect downed tools when Liverpool’s first
  bid was rejected. He was left out of Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia with
  what was said to be a thigh injury, and since then has been absent from the
  squad and at one stage was training alone at his former club Real Sociedad. He
  accused Newcastle of breaking a commitment that he could leave if a suitable
  offer came from a big club and last week refused overtures from the club
  hierarchy to reopen negotiations over a new contract. Liverpool could raise
  more funds on deadline day by selling Harvey Elliott and Joe Gomez. Aston
  Villa have emerged as a potential destination for Elliott, whose first-team
  chances are likely to be squeezed further by Isak’s arrival, but they might
  need to sell Emi Buendía first. Milan made a €15m offer for Gomez on Sunday
  night but, with complications arising in Liverpool’s pursuit of Marc Guéhi,
  the champions would be reluctant to sell the versatile defender at this stage.
