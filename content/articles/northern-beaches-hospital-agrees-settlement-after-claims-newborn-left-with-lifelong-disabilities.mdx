  Sydney’s Northern Beaches hospital has settled outside court with a family
  after claims their baby was born by emergency caesarean at 25 weeks and left
  with lifelong disabilities. Court documents seen by Guardian Australia reveal
  the baby’s mother presented to the hospital’s birthing unit in 2022,
  complaining of lower abdominal pain on her right side. The woman, who cannot
  be named for legal reasons, says she was sent home without being given an
  ultrasound or undergoing any further investigation. When she presented to the
  hospital again two days later with worse symptoms, an MRI revealed she had
  acute appendicitis. During surgery to remove the appendix, it was found to be
  perforated and had a gangrenous tip, with free pus also found in the woman’s
  pelvis. She was discharged from the hospital after three days without being
  provided with oral antibiotics, according to her claim. Also, she did not
  undergo CRP testing, which can detect signs of inflammation or infection, and
  was not assessed by the obstetrics and gynaecology registrar before her
  discharge. Less than a week later she presented again at the hospital feeling
  feverish and experiencing pain in her right flank, and suffering from
  diarrhoea and nausea. Sign up: AU Breaking News email She was transferred to
  Royal North Shore hospital, where she was diagnosed with sepsis and
  chorioamnionitis, an infection of the placenta and the amniotic fluid, and
  underwent an emergency caesarean. An amended statement of claim filed for the
  child on 20 June this year, with the mother acting in his place, alleged
  Northern Beaches hospital breached the duty of care it owed the child by
  failing to take 22 precautions. Those included failing to diagnose the mother
  with appendicitis on the day she first presented to the hospital and failing
  to perform the surgery to remove the appendix immediately. After the surgery,
  the precautions taken should have included performing blood tests, white blood
  cell count, CRP testing, an assessment by the surgical team, an ultrasound
  examination and an MRI investigation, the statement of claim alleged. The
  documents alleged the mother should not have been discharged when she was, as
  the hospital should have considered her perforated appendix, its gangrenous
  tip and the free pus and checked her inflammatory markers. She should also
  have been provided with antibiotics on discharge, the statement of claim
  alleged. The hospital’s failure to take those precautions caused or materially
  contributed to the child suffering injuries, including the consequences of
  being born significantly prematurely, and general bodily trauma and shock, the
  statement of claim alleged. A statement of particulars filed on 24 May 2024
  gave further details of the consequences of the alleged medical negligence on
  the part of the hospital. The document outlined claims that the child had
  experienced “continuing disabilities” and “loss of enjoyment of life”,
  including continuing restriction on the enjoyment of and participation in
  normal social and recreational activities such as socialising with friends and
  family, domestic activities and recreational travel. The district court
  declined to allow access to the hospital’s defence to the statement of claim.
  The statement calculated the expenses the family would have for medications
  and doctors’ visits for the rest of the child’s life. The documents also
  alleged the child had “suffered a general diminishment in [his] ability to
  earn income and … is no longer able to compete evenly on the open labour
  market … in the future”. On 31 July the parties agreed to settle the matter,
  with the Northern Beaches hospital to pay a sum without admission of
  liability. The family requested that the amount not be made public. Northern
  Beaches is the only hospital in New South Wales where public services are
  provided by a private company, Healthscope, under a complex contract. After
  years of mounting debt and a string of complaints about care standards –
  including the death of two-year-old Joe Massa and a woman whose baby died in
  childbirth because an emergency caesarean was offered too late – the hospital
  went into receivership in May. The NSW government is trying to buy it. NSW
  Health referred a request for comment on the baby’s case to Healthscope. A
  Healthscope spokesperson said: “We reached an amicable resolution with the
  family which was approved by the court. Out of respect for the family, we will
  not be providing further comment on this matter. “While adverse incidents
  happen at all hospitals, the team at Northern Beaches hospital (NBH) has been
  subjected to intense scrutiny and speculation. The fact is the hospital treats
  over 80,000 patients every year and the vast majority receive outstanding
  care,” the spokesperson said. “Indeed, the recently published Clinical
  Excellence Commission (CEC) report on Northern Beaches hospital noted that the
  hospital is ‘staffed by a committed and professional workforce with a shared
  focus on delivering safe, high-quality care.’ The CEC also found that the
  level of serious incidents at the NBH (Harm Score 1) is broadly comparable to
  its peer hospitals.” Lawyers for the family said they declined to comment.
