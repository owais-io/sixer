  Mass detention of refugees will exacerbate the suffering of torture survivors

  Caring people across the country will welcome the government’s commitment to
  offer a safe haven to those fleeing torture and persecution. However, as
  reported in your article (UK to start small boats returns to France ‘within
  days’ after EU gives green light, 4 August), the new UK-France pilot scheme,
  while offering a pathway to sanctuary for a small number of refugees, relies
  on the mass detention of those arriving, many of whom are survivors of
  torture. Freedom from Torture is one of the world’s largest torture
  rehabilitation centres. We work with men, women and children from all over the
  world who have survived unimaginable cruelty. From our clinical work, we know
  that detention is profoundly harmful for survivors. Many were tortured in
  detention, so locking them up again reopens deep psychological scars and can
  be severely retraumatising. In recent years, systems in this country to
  identify and secure the release of survivors from immigration detention have
  degraded. International cooperation is vital in response to the global
  movement of refugees, not only to ensure safety for survivors but also to stop
  repression in the first place. Safe routes to sanctuary must be part of any
  humane approach. But the focus on protection seems secondary in this scheme.
  As long as torture and persecution remain tools of oppression wielded by
  authoritarian states, people will continue to flee across borders in search of
  safety. Sonya Sceats Chief executive, Freedom from Torture
