  I am staring at a video posted on X by my beloved Cambridge United. Their
  stuff is pretty good. It’s four days until our League Two campaign begins at
  home to Cheltenham. “Striker, Acquired” it reads, the video showing a man with
  a neat beard in baggy jeans wearing the new home shirt. The music is the kind
  that if it was played too loudly in a confined space, I would instantly get a
  migraine. OK, these things aren’t aimed at me. The man does some keepie-uppies
  in bright white trainers. He has an endearing smile. He side-foots a few,
  points at the camera, leans against a post, rests a ball against his right hip
  and then smashes a penalty into the roof of the net. Our new saviour is here.
  The man to score the goals to get us back into League One at the first
  attempt. The video does not give us his name, which feels like an oversight or
  perhaps a generous amount of presumed knowledge. As someone who prides himself
  (and fills way too much of TalkSport’s airtime) at being able to guess the
  footballer from his Wikipedia page, sadly Dundee United, Broughty Athletic,
  Northampton, Stevenage has me beaten. Fortunately, the club give us the
  details with the next post. The man to pin all our hopes on is Mr Louis
  Appéré. The first comment on the post from Dan does not necessarily inspire –
  “I’ll back him but 0 goals last season and hasn’t ever been prolific anywhere,
  let’s hope he can be for us this season [thumbs up emoji].” A little more
  searching and there is one Northampton fan who is in love with him. Ellis_2002
  has named his account “Has Louis Appéré re-signed for Northampton Town yet?”.
  Ellis has posted “No” every day since his departure from Sixfields about a
  year ago. You have to admire the commitment. It should also be remembered that
  Paul Mullin had barely done anything until we taught him how to play at our
  training ground just by my parents’ house and now he’s in Deadpool. A big
  season for Appéré and he could be an Avenger. I often think about how we
  discuss players at this level. When you watch a lot of League One and League
  Two it is easy to forget quite how sensationally good all these players are.
  At one point every one of the them was the best somewhere – school, youth,
  academy, wherever. It is a weird situation where they are living the dream –
  being paid to play football – but constantly having to acknowledge they are
  not the best at this. Another of our signings, Ben Knight, made his debut for
  Manchester City in the Community Shield in 2021, coming on for Ferran Torres
  in the 74th minute against Leicester at Wembley. He played for England
  Under-18s. League Two can’t be where he expected to be four years later. It is
  a dream, but it is also an odd dream to be a lower-league footballer. You have
  the huge sacrifices from 18-30, when most of us are trying to work out how to
  be an adult, what I could term my chips, cheese and doner meat years. Add to
  that the complete lack of any semblance of security, not only of income but
  also of geography. You’ve just been sold to Exeter; you’re on loan at Grimsby,
  recalled in January. Out of contract, give Shrewsbury a go. Add to that more
  coach travel than anyone should be subjected to. At the end of it all you
  probably have to find a proper job, but without virtually any transferable
  skills. “Tell us a moment when you triumphed in adversity” … “Well, we were
  one down at Tranmere with 10 minutes to go and I bundled one in at the far
  post to keep us in the hunt for the playoffs.” “Congratulations, you’re our
  new CFO.” League Two may be the most exciting and least predictable of the top
  four divisions. It’s just you don’t pay any attention to it when you’re not in
  it. As a result I have barely looked at it since Mark Bonner took us up in the
  Covid season in 2021. But with no games played, I have a confidence that hits
  me around this time every season. Our signings look interesting. Pelly Ruddock
  Mpanzu played in the Premier League. Dominic Ball has played for lots of good
  clubs (and Peterborough). His surname is Ball. It may be a stretch to say
  League Two squads are as randomly selected as Scrabble letters, but given one
  or two very tiny sliding doors there’s every chance Cambridge’s squad would be
  a set of 25 completely different individuals. I am waiting for a player to
  answer: “So what made you choose [insert League Two club]?” with: “To be
  honest, this was the best I could do.” I’m waiting for a manager to say:
  “Look, he was our fourth choice, but the season starts next week.” Instead we
  get the facilities, the gaffer, the project as the reasons why these guys have
  chosen to be here. And we get “we’ve wanted him for a long time” from the
  manager. That may be what every new player at every club says, but I choose to
  believe the ones who are at … [check badge] Cambridge United … [kiss badge].
  In Neil Harris (whose loyalty I have never questioned) we trust. Come on you
  U’s. On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and special
  guests for one night only at the Troxy, London. Featuring the podcast’s unique
  take on the world of football – plus, audience interaction, special guests and
