  gambling addiction

  Conversation with Brian Rice flows easily. Brian Clough pounced to sign the
  red-haired midfielder after he failed to agree a contract with Hibernian in
  the summer of 1985. “Eff me, it’s Steve Davis,” roared Clough as Rice entered
  the manager’s office for the first time. It took until September ‘85 for a
  tribunal to determine Nottingham Forest would have to pay Hibs close to
  £200,000 for Rice. He had been unable to play until that dispute was resolved.
  Clough bawled at Rice again as he walked on to the training pitch the
  following day. “‘You’ll need to go back to Scotland. I’d need to sell the
  stand to sign you son,’” Rice recalls. “You should have seen the look on my
  face. Then he just started laughing. The following week I made my debut at
  Anfield. Every day was different. You didn’t know if you were training, going
  to play cricket or for an ice cream.” Rice is still very welcome at Forest,
  where he is most fondly remembered for an audacious finish against Arsenal in
  a 1988 FA Cup quarter-final. He cites Johnny Metgod as the best player he
  lined up alongside. Rice also remembers how during a Clough rant at Metgod,
  the Dutch centre-back snapped back that Forest’s manager had signed him. “And
  I’ll sell you,” Clough retorted. A fortnight later, Metgod was a Tottenham
  player. The trouble is, this endearing trip down memory lane is a precursor to
  Rice’s broader tale. He will begin the new Scottish season back in the top
  flight as Livingston’s head of football operations, a switch upstairs after
  time spent on the coaching staff. Rice will be a loss on the training pitch –
  he is widely regarded as a superb coach – and an inevitable success in his new
  post. The 61-year-old’s knowledge of football in Scotland is encyclopedic.
  Rice did not begin gambling in the midst of Forest’s laddish culture. “Mine
  started when I was at school,” he says. “Throwing pennies against a wall,
  playing cards. I barely had a drink before I went to Nottingham because I
  wanted to be a football player and the training was intense. Drink really
  didn’t interest me, but I always gambled. “My dad gambled every day but that
  was 5p or 10p and it was fun to him. It was fun to me to start with, then it
  escalated. It takes a grip of you. I knew I had a problem, a massive problem.
  But in those days, to ask for help was a sign of weakness. Now I know it is a
  massive sign of strength.” Fast forward to January 2020 and the Scottish
  Football Association announce Rice, then the manager of Hamilton, has been
  given a 10-game ban for betting on matches. “October 15th,” he says. “I was
  going to watch Scotland Under-21s against Germany at Firhill. The phone went
  at half past four in the afternoon. It was the club secretary saying: ‘Brian,
  we have had the SFA on and they are going to investigate you regarding
  gambling in football.’ I said: ‘Thank God it is over.’ “I was so relieved it
  was finished. The next day I went in to see the club owner, told him
  everything and made sure we went to the SFA and did the same. I gave them
  everything.” A whispering campaign ensued, including one that suggested Rice
  bet on games involving his own clubs. That proved to never be the case
  throughout a decade’s worth of wagers the SFA examined. Scottish football’s
  relationship with gambling is complex. Betting firms as sponsors are
  everywhere. Any harm attached to Rice’s episode was primarily to himself. “It
  was self-inflicted,” he says. “I knew I was doing wrong. I don’t make excuses
  about it. “I don’t think in any other line of work you would be punished for
  having an addiction. You get help. But they did help me. Alongside the
  suspension, I had to go to meetings for a year. It was the best punishment
  they could ever have given me. I was going to three or four meetings a week
  and I still do that to this day. Those meetings have changed my life, educated
  me and let me know why I gambled. It has given me the foundations to have a
  better life. If I stop going there, my mindset could change again. I’m not
  ashamed, I am doing something about my problem.” “I know of cases that have
  been swept under the carpet, that nobody knows about,” Rice adds. “Players
  reported to be injured at their club and they aren’t. I know that for a fact
  because I have spoken to the players. But I think it is better that way,
  better than the way it came out with me. People have families as well.” Rice
  has had low points. Plenty of them. “I was on the top of the 32-storey
  building in Qatar and ready to step off it,” he says. “That’s where it took
  me.” His successful relationship with Falkirk counted for nothing when a fan
  used gambling as a means to abuse the then-manager at Alloa Athletic. “‘I hope
  it never happens to your family,’ I replied. It was horrible. They see it as
  banter and I have to take it. I didn’t that day because it was Falkirk and, to
  be fair to the club, they were fantastic. The guy didn’t have the guts to come
  forward.” The 24-hour, 365-days availability of betting is unlike when Rice
  played on either side of the border and he believes he sold himself short with
  trips to the horse racing, casino or bookie when he could have been training.
  He also urges young footballers to get in touch if they fear gambling issues
  are spiralling out of control. “I know the signs to look for,” Rice says. “In
  six years, I have helped more than a dozen players and am still doing so now.
  Players think it is a quick fix; stop gambling for a month and I’ll be cured.
  It’s not stopping gambling, which can be quite easy; it’s changing your
  habits. I had to completely change the way I lived, even the way I drove home
  so I wasn’t passing five betting shops. Fill your day better.” The day after
  our chat, I message Rice to express gratitude for his candour. “It’s my story
  and I’ve nothing left to hide from nowadays,” he replies. “Thanks again.”
  Judgment should include the fact he is one of the game’s good guys. In the UK,
