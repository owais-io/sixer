  In the five months since Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy met at the Oval
  Office in late February, Ukrainian officials have worked hard to repair the
  damage of that day, which ended with the Ukrainian president being kicked out
  of the White House. With advice from European allies, Zelenskyy recalibrated
  his strategy for dealing with the Trump administration, and there was a
  feeling it was broadly going well. “We managed to reset communications, to
  find a new language to work with Trump,” said one senior official in Kyiv a
  week ago. It has also seemed as if Trump’s rhetoric was finally shifting, as
  he termed Russia’s bombing of Ukrainian cities “disgusting” in recent weeks
  and set Vladimir Putin a deadline of last Friday to stop the war or face the
  imposition of crippling new sanctions. Then came envoy Steve Witkoff’s visit
  to Moscow last Wednesday. Putin appears to have made no major concessions
  during the three-hour Kremlin meeting, and in return was rewarded not with
  debilitating sanctions but with an invitation to meet Trump in Alaska. The
  offer to thrash out a Ukrainian peace deal at a bilateral summit with Trump
  represents exactly the sort of great-power deal-making Putin has always
  craved. It will be his first trip to the US since 2007, with the exception of
  visits to the UN. Exactly how the Alaska summit will look is still unclear,
  with a particularly Trumpian kind of confusion and chaos accompanying its
  announcement. Kyiv, European capitals and even Trump’s own staff have been
  trying to understand what exactly was agreed in the Kremlin. The first
  announcements from the White House suggested Putin would meet Trump, followed
  by a three-way meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy. This was swiftly
  denied by Putin. As he put it, “we are still far from creating the conditions”
  for a meeting with Zelenskyy. An aide denied that the Russian side had ever
  agreed to a three-way meeting. A White House source told the New York Post on
  Thursday that if Putin did not agree to meet Zelenskyy, the meeting with Trump
  would not go ahead. But a few hours later, Trump denied that: he was happy to
  meet Putin anyway. The back-and-forth gave the distinct impression, not for
  the first time, that in the relationship between Trump and Putin, it is the
  Russian president who calls the shots. Some administration officials later
  briefed US media outlets that they may invite Zelenskyy anyway, and the German
  chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a Sunday interview he “hopes and assumes”
  that Zelenskyy will take part. For now, this does not seem likely. A senior
  White House official told NBC that Trump was “open” to a trilateral summit,
  but was “focusing on planning the bilateral meeting requested by president
  Putin”. As worrying for Kyiv as the planned format of the talks is the
  apparent Russian deal now on the table. The plan, as it has been reported
  after filtering through the Trump administration and then to European
  capitals, is that the Ukrainian army should unilaterally withdraw from the
  parts of Donetsk and Luhansk it still controls, which would presumably include
  the fortified military stronghold of Kramatorsk. In exchange, the Kremlin
  would agree to freeze the lines in other places. “Ukrainians will not give
  their land to occupiers,” Zelenskyy said over the weekend, adding that handing
  over land to Russia would violate the Ukrainian constitution. He said any deal
  done without Ukraine was destined to be “stillborn”. Zelenskyy’s public
  posture that Ukraine will never cede land is true up to a point. Kyiv is
  unlikely to renounce legal claims to its own territory, but the Ukrainian
  elite and much of Ukrainian society is increasingly ready for a deal that
  would recognise Russian de facto control, perhaps for a set period of time, in
  exchange for ending the fighting. The main problem with such a deal has always
  been what kind of guarantees Ukraine would receive that Russia would not
  simply use a ceasefire as time to regroup before attacking again. Brief
  discussions earlier this year about a European peacekeeping force to police a
  ceasefire were quickly scaled back to a “reassurance force” stationed far from
  the frontlines. Ukrainians would therefore have not much to rely on but
  Putin’s word, which they have learned from experience not to trust. Even
  still, there is a significant camp in the Ukrainian political and military
  elite who believe that, after more than three years of war, the situation has
  become so dire that the country is obliged to take such a deal, simply to
  allow for a pause in the fighting. The problem for Kyiv is the deal Putin
  apparently pitched to Witkoff is significantly worse than simply freezing the
  lines. “As things stand, Ukraine and Europe are on the verge of being
  confronted with exactly the kind of Faustian deal they feared would emerge
  back in February,” Sam Greene, a professor at King’s College London, wrote on
  X. Over the past few days, Zelenskyy and his team have been rallying support
  among European leaders and trying to put together an alternative, European
  plan. Unfortunately for Kyiv, previous experience suggests Trump is unwilling
  or unable to exert real pressure on Putin. “If Putin and Trump reach an
  agreement directly, Europe will be faced with a fait accompli. Kyiv – even
  more so,” said Roman Alekhin, a Russian war blogger, on Sunday. It is exactly
  that prospect Ukraine’s leadership will be doing their utmost to prevent in
  the days before Friday’s summit.
