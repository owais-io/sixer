  The Family Next Door review – are there any Australian coastal towns that
  aren’t full of secrets?

  Finally, after all these years, Australian television launches its first-ever
  mystery series set in a coastal town. I’m joking, I’m joking: it feels like a
  new addition to this genre arrives every other week. The latest, The Family
  Next Door, lands a month after Netflix’s The Survivors, a mystery-drama based
  in a Tasmanian coastal town riddled with secrets. This one stars Teresa Palmer
  – as did another mystery-drama earlier this year, The Last Anniversary, which
  was based in a tiny island community near Sydney riddled with secrets. Palmer
  plays Isabelle, an “enigmatic stranger” who, to quote the official synopsis,
  is central to “a mystery that disrupts the seemingly harmonious beachside
  community of Pleasant Court” – which is, of course, riddled with secrets.
  Storytellers embrace these narratives for good reasons – the picturesque
  locations and potential exportability, namely – but they have their work cut
  out for them. It’s not easy to inject creaky old templates with freshness, or
  to establish mysteries in which audiences are keen to invest. The primary
  mystery in The Family Next Door (adapted from Sally Hepworth’s novel of the
  same name) concerns the true reason Isabelle has arrived in the small
  Victorian town of Osprey Point. She moves into the aforementioned cul-de-sac
  and ingratiates herself with the locals, telling them she’s a writer penning a
  piece on how the town is “the new Byron Bay”. But the local real estate agent
  who rents a property to her, Ange (Bella Heathcote), senses Isabelle is not
  telling the truth. The audience is also aware from the get-go that something
  about Isabelle is being withheld; the first episode sees her fanging it down
  picturesque coastal roads with a Marion Crane look in her eyes, until she
  parks the car to let out an intense, primal scream: to the world, to herself,
  to everybody and nobody. There are shots of sea foam and waves crashing – not
  exactly subtle symbolism. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning We
  get to know other members of the community – including Fran (Ming-Zhu Hii),
  Essie (Philippa Northeast), Lulu (Jane Harber) and Holly (Maria Angelico), who
  periodically gather on foldout chairs in the cul-de-sac to sip wine – and
  learn of a controversial property development project Ange is leading, which
  has created backlash over concerns about its environmental impact. Early on,
  Ange meets a spooked investor who wants out – but she talks him around, buying
  herself some time. That investor is played by Vince Colosimo, who appears in
  one small scene and doesn’t come back for the next three episodes (this review
  is based on the first four of six). I’m told that he returns, but his part
  clearly isn’t big. Why do Australian storytellers these days give Colosimo
  such short shrift? He’s great talent and can sizzle in meatier roles.
  Meanwhile Palmer, as usual, provides a strong grounding presence; she has a
  gift for projecting quiet, complex intensity. And Heathcote is a highlight, as
  the morally ambiguous Ange: you’re not sure how much you can trust her, or how
  flexible her ethics are. The show is directed by Emma Freeman, whose
  impressive CV includes Stateless, Love Me, Fake and The Newsreader, and I
  appreciated the heat cinematographer Craig Barden brings to the frame,
  providing a burnt-looking texture as if the show itself has been sitting in
  the sun for too long. But even though none of it is poorly staged, everything
  feels quite same-old. The show’s central mystery just isn’t very compelling,
  and the drip-feed of revelations do little to pique our interest. Nor are the
  characters interesting enough to carry the mystery through its many slow
  spots. The Family Next Door really needed a shot in the arm, or two, or three.
  I don’t even have much desire to find out how it finishes. The Family Next
  Door starts on the ABC on Sunday at 8pm, with all episodes available to stream
  on ABC iview.
