  Secondary school pupils from low-income families are “bounced out” of studying
  subjects such as geography and languages because of fears about extra costs,
  according to a survey of children in England. Nearly a quarter (23%) of those
  surveyed who were in receipt of free school meals (FSM) said the cost – or
  worries about the cost – prevented them from choosing certain GCSE subjects,
  compared with just 9% of non-FSM pupils. Costs associated with geography field
  trips and modern foreign language visits make it difficult for the most
  disadvantaged students to pursue these subjects. Other subjects with
  additional costs include music, because of instrument lessons, food and
  nutrition, which requires ingredients, and PE, due to the extra kit and
  equipment required. Almost a third (30%) of FSM students said their families
  already struggle to afford the basics they need for homework, including access
  to technology and devices. The survey of more than 1,000 students, which was
  conducted by Survation for the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), revealed
  stark differences between pupils on FSM and their non-FSM peers. Secondary
  pupils on FSM are nearly twice as likely as their better-off peers to say
  their family’s income makes it harder for them to learn at school (15% v 8%).
  They are also more likely to say it is difficult to afford pens and pencils
  (14% v 8%). Of those children in receipt of FSM, a third (34%) said it is
  difficult to afford school trips and a fifth (21%) struggle to pay for clubs,
  while more than a quarter (27%) said it is difficult to afford musical
  instruments or instrument tuition CPAG’s head of education policy, Kate
  Anstey, said: “Children in struggling families are going back to school only
  to be bounced out of some subjects and learning by costs – cut off from
  opportunities just as the foundations of their futures are being laid. “The
  prime minister has promised to leave ‘no stone unturned to give every child
  the very best start at life’ but actions are needed to match that objective.
  Government’s forthcoming child poverty strategy must invest in family incomes
  and children’s life chances – and scrapping the two-child limit must be the
  first action point.” It costs parents of secondary schoolchildren a minimum of
  £2,275 a year to send a child to school, according to earlier CPAG research,
  of which £450 goes on learning materials including stationery, revision guides
  and calculators. Labour’s flagship child poverty strategy was originally due
  to be published in the spring, but was delayed amid continuing debate about
  the cost implications of ending the two-child benefit cap. The cap, which
  limits parents to claiming many means-tested benefits for their first two
  children, apart from in very limited circumstances, was introduced under the
  Conservatives. Experts say scrapping it would be the single most effective way
  of reducing child poverty. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We
  are absolutely clear that schools should make sure the cost of curriculum
  subjects is not a barrier to access and that materials necessary for
  examinations are provided to all pupils. “More widely, we are putting pounds
  back in parents’ pockets by limiting the number of branded uniform items,
  expanding free school meals to every family on universal credit and rolling
  out free breakfast clubs across the country.”
