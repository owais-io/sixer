  Three down, three more to go. For mortgage holders, that was the most
  optimistic takeaway from Michele Bullock’s press conference after the Reserve
  Bank of Australia’s decision to cut its cash rate for the third time this
  year. The RBA’s cash rate target started the year at 4.35% and – after moves
  in February, May and now August – it has reached 3.6%. “We’ve become
  increasingly confident that inflation is on track to be in our 2% to 3% target
  range on a sustainable basis,” the RBA governor said, before adding that the
  central bank and its board were “determined to keep inflation down”. Those
  rosy inflation forecasts depend on a key assumption, or what Bullock called
  the bank’s “best guess” about where rates would go from here. That assumed
  path is a further rate cut by the end of this year, another by the following
  June, and then potentially one more by the end of 2026. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email “The forecasts imply that the cash rate might need to be a bit
  lower than it is today to keep inflation low and stable, and employment
  growing, but there is still a lot of uncertainty,” she said. And while the
  direction of travel for rates looks clear, there was plenty of evidence from
  Bullock’s press conference that the RBA is not particularly convinced when
  those moves need to happen. In July the board surprised us by not cutting its
  cash rate. But Bullock made it clear that the RBA just needed to tick a couple
  of boxes before taking the plunge. Now, the vision is much blurrier. The board
  is taking things “meeting by meeting”, the governor said a number of times.
  What would potentially determine when we might get another cut? She responded
  with a laundry list of data that the central bank’s policy board considers
  when they make their decisions. Another question: Is the cash rate at 3.6% a
  handbrake on the economy? Maybe, maybe not, Bullock replied. All of which is
  to say: again, two or three more rate cuts is the bank’s “best guess”. Sure,
  it would be nice to think the bank can do more than just guess, but monetary
  policy this deep into a cutting cycle looks a lot more like art than science.
  For now, we will have to console ourselves with the prospect that interest
  rates, at some stage, “might need to be a bit lower”. • Patrick Commins is
