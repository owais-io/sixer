  For some, childhood trauma provides the spur to later achievement. The
  computer scientist Stephanie “Steve” Shirley undoubtedly viewed herself this
  way. She had sworn “never, ever to be poor again”, and that hers should be “a
  life worth saving”. Shirley, who has died aged 91, arrived in Britain as a
  child refugee from nazism at five years old. In the overwhelmingly
  male-dominated computer industry, she founded a company that pioneered
  outsourcing and opportunities for women, and reached a shareholder value of
  $3bn. Believing that “money that isn’t working has a kind of obscenity about
  it”, she became one of Britain’s foremost philanthropists, supporting research
  and practice in the care of children with autism. A natural gift for
  mathematics led Shirley to a career in computing, when engineers and systems
  designers were first establishing that industry in the 1950s. At the time,
  women often had difficulty keeping their positions in the workplace after they
  married, and especially after they had children. Shirley married in 1959, and
  in 1962 she set up her own company, Freelance Programmers, to provide
  outsourced software development. With only £6 of capital, she started the
  business from her kitchen table. She decided to recruit women such as herself,
  experienced and professionally qualified but spending their time at home with
  domestic responsibilities. All they needed was a telephone, and a pencil and
  paper to draw flowcharts and write code. At first Shirley had an uphill
  struggle to win clients, but after she took to signing her letters of
  introduction as Steve instead of Stephanie, the work began to flow in. Major
  clients included the Anglo-French partnership that developed the supersonic
  Concorde airliner, for which Shirley’s cottage industry workers programmed the
  black box flight recorder. The company pioneered flexible working, all
  designed to suit the needs of female employees. In 1974 Shirley rebranded the
  company as F International (later the FI Group; it eventually became Xansa),
  the F not only for freelance, but for also flexible and free. Of its first 300
  employees, only three were men; but after the introduction of the Sex
  Discrimination Act in 1975, she recruited men and women equally. Although
  Shirley stepped down as chief executive in 1987, she remained the major
  shareholder until 1991. At that point she sold a controlling interest in the
  company to the staff: her proud claim was that she had made 70 of them into
  millionaires. With the flotation of the company in 1996, she too became
  personally wealthy, able to build up a substantial personal art collection –
  which she later gave away to charities. She was never interested in money for
  its own sake, and in the same year she set up the Shirley Foundation to
  support causes that she cared about. The first of these was autism: her son,
  Giles, born in 1963, developed a severe form of the condition and died
  prematurely of an epileptic seizure in 1998. The second was information
  technology: Shirley provided the Worshipful Company of Information
  Technologists, a new livery company founded in 1980, with the means to acquire
  a permanent home in the City of London, and endowed the Oxford Internet
  Institute, founded in 2001, at the University of Oxford. The many honours she
  received in her lifetime recognised not only Shirley’s success in business,
  but also the tens of millions of pounds she devoted to charitable causes. She
  was born Vera Stephanie Buchthal in Dortmund, Germany, where her Jewish
  father, Arnold, was a judge. His wife, Margaret (nee Schick), was from Vienna.
  As their lives became less and less secure under the Nazi regime, in 1939 the
  family took the agonising decision to send their two daughters, Vera and her
  elder sister, Renate, to Britain on the Kindertransport. The girls were
  fostered by a couple in Lichfield, Staffordshire, Guy and Ruby Smith, a time
  that Shirley remembered as happy and secure. Although the Buchthal parents
  eventually escaped to Britain, they separated after the war and the family was
  never fully reunited. A self-confessed swot, Vera attended Oswestry girls’
  high school, having to go to the local boys’ school for lessons in
  mathematics. At the age of 18 she was naturalised as a British subject and
  took the name Stephanie Brook. Being unaware of opportunities for girls to
  study the science subjects that interested her, she opted not to go to
  university, a decision she later regretted. Instead she took a low-paid job
  (lower than if she had been a man) as a clerical officer at the Post Office
  Research Station in Dollis Hill, north-west London, carrying out mathematical
  work on a desk calculator. Over six years she managed to earn a mathematics
  degree through evening classes at the Sir John Cass Technical College, and was
  promoted to work on electronic computers. In 1959 she married Derek Shirley,
  an engineer at Dollis Hill. For the next two years she worked for Computer
  Developments, a division of the British computer manufacturer ICL, where she
  managed her own team of software developers. However, she continued to feel
  disadvantaged by her gender, and decided to leave and set up her own company.
  She headed the business while caring for her severely disabled son, and
  suffered a breakdown before she finally gained access to appropriate
  professional support. The experience informed her choices as a philanthropist:
  she first set up a residential home for Giles and other young people with
  autism, and subsequently endowed further autism charities including the
  residential school Prior’s Court, in Berkshire, and the medical research
  organisation Autistica. She applied her business acumen to her philanthropic
  activities, never being satisfied just to give money away. She was made a dame
  in 2000 and a companion of honour in 2017. In 2010 she appeared on BBC Radio
  4’s Desert Island Discs. A self-confessed workaholic, Shirley declared that
  “work is not just something I do when I’d rather be doing something else”. Her
  autobiography, Let IT Go came out in 2012 and she took every opportunity,
  through interviews and public appearances, to present her experience as an
  inspiration to others. Many successful women downplay the struggles they have
  faced because of their gender, but Shirley was vocal about the sexism she had
  encountered. Ambitious women have flat heads, she told the audience at a TED
  talk in 2015 “from being patted patronisingly”. It would have been many years,
  however, since anyone had dared to patronise Steve Shirley. Derek died in
  2021. Shirley is survived by her niece, Clare. • Vera Stephanie “Steve”
