  Holidaymakers in Britain have been warned they could face delays when
  travelling this weekend as the weight of almost 18m car journeys and
  widespread rail engineering works are expected to cause disruption over the
  August bank holiday, celebrated in England and Wales. The RAC said drivers
  should set off as early as possible to avoid heavy traffic, particularly on
  major routes to airports and coastal areas. The south-east and south-west of
  England are expected to see the heaviest congestion. Heavy traffic is expected
  on the M5 between Bristol and Devon, according to the transport analytics
  company Inrix. On Friday and Saturday there are likely to be holdups of more
  than 40 minutes on the stretch between junction 15 north of Bristol and
  junction 23 for Bridgwater. On Friday, drivers making Channel crossings via
  Dover or Folkestone are expected to face delays exceeding 30 minutes on the
  M20 in Kent. The best times to travel will be after 7pm on Friday, before 9am
  on Saturday and before 11am on Monday, with traffic expected to be lighter on
  Sunday. Approximately 17.6m car journeys are expected to be made during the
  long weekend. The figures are based on a survey of 2,080 UK adults,
  extrapolated to the 34m cars licensed in the UK. Nick Mullender, the repairs
  team leader at the RAC, said: “More traffic on the roads will inevitably lead
  to more vehicle breakdowns, especially if the sun makes an appearance and
  people decide on the day to visit popular destinations. Anyone planning routes
  through these areas should set off as early as possible or be prepared to
  spend longer in traffic.” Rail passengers face their own challenges. Some
  major routes will be closed for engineering works as Network Rail carries out
  261 projects over the long weekend. Long-distance services will be suspended
  between London King’s Cross and Peterborough on Sunday, affecting
  Anglo-Scottish routes along the east coast mainline by LNER and Lumo. Avanti
  West Coast will run a reduced service to and from London Euston from Saturday
  to Monday, with their trains between Birmingham New Street and Birmingham
  International being diverted, adding extra time to journeys. London
  Northwestern services will run to and from Birmingham International only.
  Helen Hamlin, the chief network operator at Network Rail, said: “While the
  vast majority of the railway will be running, works on some parts of the
  network are unfortunately unavoidable as we complete major work to support a
  better, more reliable railway that we wouldn’t be able to complete in a normal
  weekend. So we’re asking passengers to check their journeys in advance to
  ensure their route isn’t affected.” • This article was amended on 19 August
  2025. An earlier version used agency reporting that said there would be no
  Avanti West Coast trains between Birmingham New Street and Birmingham
  International from Saturday to Monday. In fact, there will be trains, but a
  diversion will add extra time to the journeys. Also, the spelling of
  Bridgwater has been corrected.
