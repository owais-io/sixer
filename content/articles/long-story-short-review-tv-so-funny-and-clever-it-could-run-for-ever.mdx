  Few shows in recent memory have boasted the hidden depths of Raphael
  Bob-Waksberg’s BoJack Horseman. Conceived and marketed as a surreal stoner
  comedy about the madcap adventures of a delusional washed-up half-human,
  half-horse former sitcom star, BoJack quickly burned off its premise and
  unfurled into something quite wonderful. Little by little, the jokes started
  to disappear. The central character stopped being a punchbag and became a case
  study of depression and loneliness. At times, the focus on trauma was
  overwhelming – witness The View From Halfway Down episode, in which BoJack is
  haunted by figures from his past while his brain starves of oxygen as he
  drowns in a pool – but the series was ambitious enough to single out
  Bob-Waksberg as a generational talent. It stands to reason that his new
  series, Long Story Short, should give us several generations at once. The show
  is the tale of the Schwoopers, an unexceptional Jewish family, told at various
  points between 1959 and 2022. Chronologically, episodes shuffle the deck – one
  might start in the 1990s and end this decade, or vice versa – which means that
  all the characters are in a constant state of flux. There is no fixed point to
  them. They are all transitional figures, growing and learning from various
  levels of experience. In essence, this makes Long Story Short the
  anti-Simpsons. The Simpsons is trapped in the perpetual now, with the
  characters still the same age as they were in the 1990s. Long Story Short,
  though, cannot sit still, barely managing to stay in the same year for 15
  minutes at a time. Characters we see as children grow old, have kids, lose
  their hair, get divorced; their carefree youth gives way to the regret-filled
  trudge of middle age. Which sounds heavier than it is. Because, on a
  minute-by-minute basis, Long Story Short is fantastically funny. Episodes rip
  along in a flurry of one-liners and sitcom tropes – there is a chaotic
  barmitzvah, a harebrained business enterprise, a fertility mix-up – that land
  almost without fail. There is even a scattering of blink-and-you’ll-miss-them
  visual gags, such as when a young mother daydreams that her children will grow
  up to win the Nobel prize for emotional regulation. The magic trick is the
  slow build of melancholy that gradually amasses beneath all this. Bob-Waksberg
  has claimed that the show deals with “small-t” trauma. There is nothing (at
  least for now) that plumbs the operatic darkness of BoJack Horseman, but we
  are still given enough to learn why all these imperfect people are the way
  they are. Usually the root cause tends to be a well-intentioned but
  emotionally ill-equipped parent, because some things never change. The parent
  in question here is more often than not Naomi, played spectacularly by Lisa
  Edelstein. Long Story Short has an incredible cast – Ben Feldman, Abbi
  Jacobson, Paul Reiser, Max Greenfield – but Edelstein is given the most amount
  of scenery to chew. An overbearing matriarch prone to assaulting everyone
  around her with a suffocating mix of affection, dismissal and
  passive-aggression, Naomi is the closest this show comes to being
  two-dimensional. Had the series been set at one fixed point in time – perhaps
  as we meet her in episode one, belittling her son’s new girlfriend for not
  grasping the finer points of a Jewish household – that accusation would
  probably stand. But before long we have been bounced back in time and
  introduced to her mother, at which point you can’t help but sympathise with
  her. Again and again, the show reminds us that everything is an echo of what
  came before. This is a testament to Bob-Waksberg’s writing. This level of
  granular, non-linear character development must have been a feat to construct,
  and yet it feels effortless. These seem like snapshots from a real life that
  has already been lived. Every progression rings true. Every new turn feels
  earned. You hesitate to wonder precisely the level of autobiography he is
  pulling from, and whether any of his family is still talking to him.
  Theoretically, a show as funny and clever as this could run for ever. That
  said, shows like this have a habit of running out of steam faster than usual.
  Dan Fogelman’s This Is Us, which similarly told a non-chronological family
  story, quickly found itself hamstrung by a lack of material; all the juicy
  plots were eaten up quickly, leaving the series to sustain itself on
  increasingly mediocre memories until it fizzled out. It would be a disservice
  to the pure enjoyment of these opening episodes if the Schwoopers were forced
  to exist on similar scraps down the line. Hopefully, that won’t happen. I have
  lived with this family for six decades now, and I’m still greedy for more. •
  Long Story Short is on Netflix now.
