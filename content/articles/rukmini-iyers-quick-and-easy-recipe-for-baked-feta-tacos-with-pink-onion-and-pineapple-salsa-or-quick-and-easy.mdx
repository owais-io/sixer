  I will never stop loving cheese and pineapple as a combination, and this
  version, with herby baked feta and spiced pineapple salsa, is the perfect
  update to the classic on a stick. Stuffed into warm tortillas with crunchy
  lettuce, this is a lovely summery dinner that comes together in minutes. Baked
  feta tacos with pink onion and pineapple salsa The salsa is best made just
  before serving, so prep and chop everything and keep it separately in the
  fridge, if need be (though you could chop and mix the onion with the lime in
  advance). Prep 15 min Cook 25 min Serves 2 200g block feta ½ tbsp olive oil
  5-6 stalks oregano and/or thyme ½ tsp chipotle chilli flakes 4 small corn
  tortillas 1 romaine lettuce, finely sliced For the salsa 1 fresh, ripe
  pineapple, peeled, cored and flesh cut into small chunks 1 small red onion,
  peeled and very finely chopped 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped 15g
  fresh mint, finely chopped 1-2 limes, zest and juice A pinch of sea salt
  flakes Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the feta on a lined
  baking tray, drizzle with the olive oil, then scatter over the oregano and/or
  thyme and chilli flakes, and bake for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the
  pineapple, onion, chilli, mint and lime zest, then add the lime juice and salt
  a little at a time, tasting as you go. (You may need all or just one of the
  limes, depending on how juicy they are.) Warm the tortillas in a hot pan for
  30 seconds per side, or according to the packet instructions. Pile the
  lettuce, pineapple salsa and hot, broken-up feta into the tortillas, and eat
  immediately.
