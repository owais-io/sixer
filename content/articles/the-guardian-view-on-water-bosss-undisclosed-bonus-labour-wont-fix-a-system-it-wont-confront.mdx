  The Guardian view on water boss’s undisclosed bonus: Labour won’t fix a system
  it won’t confront

  Despite the noise around England’s sewage scandal, the political response so
  far has mostly generated headlines, not real consequences. Ministers
  performatively “rage” about polluting water companies. Regulators are
  rejigged. Laws are passed. Yet little actually changes. The latest manoeuvre
  by Yorkshire Water is a case in point – and a revealing one. In March, the
  company was ordered to pay £40m for the “unacceptable impact” of sewage spills
  blamed on poor maintenance. It was one of six firms caught by Labour’s new
  bonus ban for the most serious polluters, passed under the Water (Special
  Measures) Act earlier this year. But the company confirmed to the Guardian
  that its chief executive, Nicola Shaw, received an additional £660,000 for
  “investor-related” work last year – on top of her £689,000 take home pay. The
  money did not come from Yorkshire Water directly, but from Kelda Holdings, the
  firm’s offshore parent. Using complex corporate structures to sidestep
  regulatory scrutiny is not a new trick. Many water companies are structured to
  allow financial engineering to take place at one remove from the regulated
  business. But Yorkshire’s executive reward scheme reveals something important
  about the nature of the bonus ban itself: its design left scope for avoidance.
  If companies can reclassify pay or shift it between entities, enforcement
  becomes a matter of interpretation. Ministers say they are “aware” of the
  payments and Ofwat is “assessing” them. But this is a now-familiar Whitehall
  formulation – passive, conditional and hollow. The environment secretary,
  Steve Reed, appears to have a habit of making threats he doesn’t back up. When
  Southern Water, also under the bonus ban, nearly doubled the pay package
  awarded to its CEO to £1.4m, Mr Reed’s response was to urge him to turn it
  down. No ministerial direction to investigate. No legal challenge or
  legislative amendment. Just a suggestion. Why the timidity? Because Labour’s
  tough talk on water is just words. It won’t touch the system that enables this
  behaviour, and ministers bend over backwards to reassure markets they never
  will. The Treasury wants Thames Water kept private – warning Mr Reed a £4bn
  rescue through nationalisation would gut his entire budget. No wonder he keeps
  shroud-waving about the cost of public ownership The government seems dazzled
  by private providers. Regulators are being asked to offer “forbearance”, as Mr
  Reed’s Independent Water Commission suggested. No doubt they had in mind
  Thames Water, which is facing an estimated £1bn in Ofwat performance
  penalties. The logic seems to be that enforcement risks spooking the investors
  needed to fund long-overdue infrastructure upgrades. But this reveals the real
  problem. England’s water system has been financialised to the point of
  dysfunction. Layered holding companies, offshore entities and opaque capital
  structures mean regulators are chasing shadows. Attempts to govern via gesture
  – bonus bans, naming and shaming – are no substitute for structural reform.
  Most countries retain public ownership, recognising water as a public good,
  not a commodity. The idea that better people could fix the system is a fantasy
  – decades of extraction, debt-loading and dividend grabs show the model itself
  is broken. If Labour truly wants to clean up the nation’s waterways, it must
  confront a hard truth: the incentives of private capital and the obligations
  of public interest, health and accountability do not align. Until then, expect
  more sewage, more euphemisms and more payments that defy the spirit – if not
  always the letter – of the law. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in
