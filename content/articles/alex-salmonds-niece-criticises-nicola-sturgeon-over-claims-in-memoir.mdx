  Alex Salmond’s niece has accused Nicola Sturgeon of tarnishing her uncle’s
  reputation when he is no longer able to defend himself in order to promote her
  memoir. Christina Hendry told BBC Radio Scotland on Monday: “If my uncle was
  here today, these things would not be being said. I believe they’re being said
  because he’s not here to defend himself, as he would have done with every
  fibre of his being.” Sturgeon’s political partnership with her predecessor as
  first minister, who died suddenly of a heart attack last October at the age of
  69, dominates her memoir, Frankly, which was published last week. She
  describes tensions that existed between them long before their catastrophic
  falling out over her government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints
  against him, claiming that he opposed equal marriage, overrode her concerns
  about releasing the Lockerbie bomber and had several extramarital affairs. The
  former Scottish National party leader stood trial in 2020 on 13 counts of
  sexual assault and was cleared of all charges, although a pattern of bullying
  and inappropriate behaviour towards younger female staff emerged in court.
  Asked what she believed was motivating Sturgeon, Hendry said: “There’s been a
  number of years that these things could have been said, and the timing of it
  now where she’s released a book and is looking to publicise that, I think many
  people have thought that could be the case.” Sturgeon writes in Frankly that
  she “agonised” about “stirring up pain for [Salmond’s] wife and family” but
  concluded “I cannot let what he said stand unchallenged”. She addresses in
  detail the theory espoused by Salmond before his death that the harassment
  allegations were part of a conspiracy confected by Sturgeon’s inner circle –
  but then advances her own theory that Salmond himself may have leaked the
  initial revelations to the Daily Record, a claim immediately rejected by the
  journalist who broke the story. Her treatment of Salmond in the memoir drew
  immediate fire from his allies last week, with some demanding retraction and
  an apology to his widow, Moira. On Sunday, Moira Salmond revealed she had
  instructed lawyers to continue her late husband’s legal action against the
  Scottish government over its botched handling of the investigation into the
  original sexual harassment allegations. She was reportedly galvanised by the
  claims made in Frankly. Hendry said: “Our family are most definitely united on
  continuing the things that my uncle started before he passed. As a family, we
  are very close and we’re very strong and we will continue to do anything we
  need to do to defend his name.” She also confirmed her plans to run for
  Holyrood next year for Alba, the party set up by Salmond in 2021 after he quit
  the SNP, which challenged its failure to deliver a second independence
  referendum. “I intend to stand to both honour my uncle’s legacy, but also
  because I understand a lot of frustrations that rural communities like the
  north-east have.”
