  A man from New Jersey has gone viral after breakdancing at a local town hall
  meeting. Will Thilly, a resident of the township of Cranford, just outside New
  York City, on Tuesday took to the podium by performing a wordless robot dance.
  As he made his way up the aisle, he spun around and danced without music,
  leaving the room in an awkward silence. Some attendees looked away while
  others buried their faces in their hands. Around 40 seconds into his
  performance, Thilly reached the podium, let out a sigh before jogging back to
  grab a bottle of water and some papers. The room remained silent until he
  spoke. “How was everyone’s weekend?” he asked, before adding that he had just
  returned from Monterrey, Mexico. “There’s no pizza there … [but] it’s a
  beautiful town with lots of history,” Thilly said. He then asked: “Anyone here
  afraid of flying?” Thilly proceeded to ask if anyone wanted to see him perform
  a backspin. When no one responded, he laid on the ground, lifted his feet and
  spun several times. As he danced, the crowd stayed silent, with some attendees
  looking uncomfortable. When he finished, Thilly gestured for applause but
  received none. He then asked: “Why did our taxes go up so much?” Thilly went
  on to reference a previous local referendum, questioning why the tax increase
  was apparently higher than anticipated. He said: “We were told the referendum
  was going to bring [taxes] up for an average household [by] around $400 … and
  mine went up like 900 bucks … We were told like that was from the schools or
  something? But the school referendum said it would only go up … like 400 bucks
  on an average assessed home … So I wanted to know why it went up, if it did
  that and what extra expenses were incurred by the schools that weren’t told to
  the public when we voted on that referendum?” Following his remarks, Thilly
  gathered his papers and water bottle and moon-walked away from the podium,
  again in silence. Thilly appears to have a track record of unconventional town
  hall appearances, frequently posting videos of them on Instagram in recent
  months. In these videos, he makes various calls for change. At some town hall
  meetings, he urges wealthy developers to pay their own taxes rather than
  shifting the burden to residents. In others, he encourages residents to be
  friends with each other. And sometimes he stands at the podium saying nothing
  at all. Currently, Thilly is running as an independent candidate for the
  Cranford ownship committee. On his campaign website, he says: “I want to be
  elected to stop the resident-funded overdevelopment of Cranford … Our township
  meetings need to be about getting residents what they want, by offering clear
  answers to their questions, encouraging open discussion and dialogue, and
  ultimately working together for consensus and compromise. I will lead this
  effort.” The Guardian has reached out to Thilly for comment.
