  ‘We are diverse cultures come together’: the vision of harmony behind
  Manchester’s Caribbean carnival

  The Caribbean islands of St Kitts and Nevis are 4,000 miles from Greater
  Manchester and a fraction of the size. But the dual-island nation inspired a
  tradition in the English metropolis that is still going 55 years on – the
  annual carnival in Moss Side. Geraldine Walters, 79, a retired mental health
  nurse who was born in St Kitts, and her late husband, Rudolph, from Nevis,
  were on the very first organising committee from the Leeward Islands People’s
  Association (Lipa). She remembers how passionate everyone was about making it
  work – so passionate that when funding from the authorities arrived late one
  year, carnival treasurer Rudolph took out a loan to fund it, using their home
  as collateral, without her knowing. She said: “We had it for people to come
  together and have a good time and enjoy themselves, because sometimes in the
  community you didn’t know anyone – it was for Black, white, anyone who wanted
  to come and enjoy themselves.” It’s a legacy that still unites people today.
  This weekend, thousands will gather in and around Princess Road, the route to
  Manchester airport that bisects Moss Side, for a celebration of Caribbean
  culture that would not be possible without the carnivals of the early 70s.
  Locita Brandy, now 90, left Nevis for Britain in the late 1950s. The
  Manchester she came to, with its gaslit terraced streets, was austere and
  still scarred by the war. In those early days making a new life on Carter
  Street, Moss Side, to help her family back at home, living conditions involved
  “four people in one room, cooking on a paraffin heater on a landing upstairs”
  and encountering the idea of “race” and its inequalities for the very first
  time, her son, Keithly Brandy says. As a Black woman at that time her
  opportunities to socialise were restricted not just by race, but by gender
  roles, Keithly says. But through the Church of England and the Mothers’ Union
  she began to develop as an activist, while bringing up six children. By 1970,
  émigrés from the Leeward Islands – the arc of tropical jewels between the
  Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean – including Locita Brandy and the
  Walters, decided to stage an event that would brighten up the year. Five years
  earlier, they had formed the Leeward Islands Association, at the home of local
  baker Billy Hanley, with the objective of “promoting racial harmony, morally,
  socially and culturally”. The first event involved Lipa joining Alexandra
  Park’s centenary festival, which was like an English summer fete, before
  throwing an impromptu procession through the streets, with one steel band and
  three floats. In the years that followed, Irish dancers mingled with the
  carnival traditions of Trinidad, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis and
  Antigua, infused with the spirit of Jamaica’s junkanoo masquerades, with
  troupes led by a police marching band and white horses parading through Moss
  Side, and dances in the neighbourhood’s Polish Club. There were no elaborate
  costumes. Moss Side’s traditional English haberdashers donated fabric for the
  event, while the late Labour MP Tony Lloyd acted as patron, and big Manchester
  employers such as Kellogg’s acted as sponsors. Prizes for the carnival king
  and queen were handed out at Belle Vue fairground. The day started early – and
  when it was over, everyone got together to clear up the litter. “That’s what I
  like about Manchester,” Viola Walters, Geraldine’s daughter, who made costumes
  for carnivals past while her mother cooked “for thousands”, said. “We are
  diverse and different cultures come together.” Manchester’s carnival has
  evolved through the years, with continued debates in the city about how it can
  stay true to its roots. Pioneers like the Walters, describe feeling left
  behind – although today’s event says it celebrates the “elders” who “worked
  tirelessly” to keep it going. When asked to sum up his mother’s legacy,
  Keithly Brandy, who, with his siblings, grew up steeped in the traditions of
  Manchester’s earliest carnivals, uses just one word, without any hesitation:
  “Overlooked.” “It’s been an uphill struggle to get mum’s legacy recognised,”
  he added. Keithly is now working through the dozens of crates that his mother
  compiled in a lifetime of activism that took her to South Africa on
  pan-African missions, and to Croatia, Poland and Russia with the Mothers’
  Union. Her papers, now being carefully catalogued by Manchester’s Ahmed Iqbal
  Ullah Race Centre, are thought to comprise one of the UK’s most extensive,
  post-Windrush Black history archives. Keithly envisages a future where
  insights from the collection will be taught in schools, alongside African
  languages. There are unmarked signs all over Manchester of Locita Brandy’s
  work as a campaigner, educator, social worker, councillor and Christian
  activist. In the pelican crossing she fought for in Moss Side after a child
  was knocked over. In the sports ground that was set up for girls to enjoy
  sport. In the memories of adults who enjoyed their first childhood trips to
  the seaside through the Normanby Street youth project she began, and the
  former pupils of the now-closed Birley High who remember the
  African-Caribbean-inspired dishes she introduced to the menu while working at
  the school kitchen. For Locita and the early carnival organisers, including
  Basil Gumbs and Estelle Palmer (the great-grandmother of Premier League
  footballer Cole Palmer) carnival was just one way of keeping heritage alive.
  “Mrs Brandy and the others who came here as part of the Windrush generation,
  they were homesick,” the Manchester historian Linford Sweeney said. “And while
  London had their carnival, there was nothing going on in Manchester for the
  community, it was basically work, work, work and more work.” As a fusion of
  pan-African, uniquely Caribbean and European traditions, a traditional
  carnival – with its mas bands, steelpans, feathered headdresses and costumes,
  carnival queen, princess and prince – derives directly from the tensions and
  exchanges of colonialism. It draws on traditional African masquerades as well
  the parodies of French colonisers’ masked balls that enslaved people would
  hold in Trinidad; the word carnival – which by one interpretation means
  “farewell to meat” – is linked to Roman Catholic, Lenten traditions.
  Fundamentally, Sweeney says, carnival is about freedom. “It’s not a party
  really, it’s a celebration,” he said. “It’s meant to be a celebration of
  freedom. In 1834, with the end of slavery, people got their chance to be free
  to do what they wanted to do, went through the streets and they had various
  parades and various things to celebrate freedom. “We can’t forget that. If we
  forget what happened to us when we were called three-fifths human and called
  property, then I’m sorry for the next generation, because they could end up in
  exactly the same position.” The British, post-Windrush version of carnival,
  while echoing liberation celebrations, accelerated with the introduction of
  Jamaican sound system culture, which brought reggae and soca outdoors. “My mum
  allowed me, as a young person, to introduce the sound systems to carnival,”
  Keithly Brandy said. I had friends in London – the Mastermind Roadshow, though
  they were called Conqueror at the time, and they were allowed to come down and
  play. They played at the Abasindi Centre until 5am.” Sweeney has fond memories
  of spending the 70s setting up youth theatres in Manchester and riding with
  the Natty Bongo sound system. “Carnival and sound systems went hand in hand,”
  he said. “People were starting to really think, listen, let’s get out of the
  house parties – the ones the older people used to do in people’s front rooms.
  The blues parties started coming in with the sound systems. We’d go to the
  Russell Club and then a blues party – we didn’t finish until 6am in the
  morning.” Manchester Caribbean Carnival is on 9 and 10 August, with a packed
  programme of events from early, including J’Ouvert, a parade and music in
  Alexandra Park, Moss Side
