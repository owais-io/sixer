  In a dangerous new escalation of his authoritarian rule, Donald Trump has
  placed the police of Washington DC under federal control and announced that he
  will deploy the national guard to the country’s capital. According to the
  president, crime in the city is “out of control” – no matter that crime
  numbers are down significantly, including for violent crimes. But, of course,
  this power grab is not really about facts, it is about distraction and
  perception, and a chance to reconnect and refocus his base. Like all the other
  outrageous things Trump has been doing in the last weeks, the DC takeover is,
  first and foremost, an attempt to deflect from the Jeffrey Epstein case. As
  previously demonstrated by his demand to rename the NFL team to the (racist)
  Washington Redskins, his attacks on the Wall Street Journal, or his calls to
  prosecute former president Barack Obama (“Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard
  of him?”) that he will do anything to get the Epstein case out of the
  political and public debate. But it is not just a deflection, it is also an
  attempt to bring the attention of his base back to the core of their bond with
  Trump, namely authoritarianism and nativism (which are, as always with the far
  right, closely connected). There is a clear pattern in the cities Trump links
  to disorder and violence. Cities like Baltimore, DC and Oakland are broadly
  identified as Black cities in the US, while cities like Los Angeles (Hispanic)
  and New York (the quintessential melting pot) are also often excluded from the
  “real” America in rightwing narratives. Of course, in the racist mind, Black
  and multiracial is connected to crime, danger, disorder – as are “the city”
  and “urban” centers (both deeply racialized concepts in the US). This racist
  fear and rejection of the multiracial city has a very long history in the
  country, but also for Trump himself too. Just remember his response to the
  infamous Central Park Five, a multiracial group of teenagers accused of raping
  a white female jogger in 1989. Before the facts were known, Trump published an
  open letter in four local newspapers, in which he described New York City as a
  city out of control, called for the teenage boys to be “executed”, and
  demanded that the city’s leaders “Bring back the death penalty. Bring back our
  police.” Attacks on multiracial cities were also a major part of his deeply
  racist 2024 campaign. For example, he claimed that Philadelphia was “ravaged
  by bloodshed”, and compared Detroit to a developing country. Trump’s aversion
  for multiracial cities was undoubtedly strengthened by the Black Lives Matter
  protests in 2020, which were successfully “vilified” in the rightwing media –
  today, only 22% of Republicans support the BLM movement, compared to 84% of
  Democrats. Moreover, multiracial cities vote disproportionately for the
  Democrats, which is another sore point. And it is another crucial aspect of
  Trump’s authoritarian power grab. By targeting multiracial cities like DC and
  Los Angeles, Trump not only plays into the widespread racist association of
  these cities with crime and violence, but he also strengthens the belief that
  these “Democrat-run cities” are “out of control”. The message to his base is
  clear: Democratic rule in the (Black) cities is “weak” and endangers the
  (white) “Heartland” – all, of course, ultimately linked to the alleged “open
  border” policies of former president Joe Biden. Finally, the power grab is
  part of a broader agenda to create a deeply authoritarian and personalized
  state, in which the monopoly of violence rests exclusively in the hands of
  Trump. If implemented, the new budget will transform the US into a deportation
  state, centered around the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which is increasingly operating as
  a presidential militia that is not just above the law but also above other law
  enforcement and even military agencies. It is crucial that liberal democratic
  actors take this authoritarian power grab seriously – without letting it
  distract them, or the wider public, from the Epstein case. As long as the
  courts still work, at least to some extent, the Trump administration should be
  challenged in court – despite initial setbacks, the court case over Trump’s
  power grab in California remains open. Media have a responsibility to inform
  the public of the real facts, including real-time factchecking of Trump
  speeches. But, most importantly, media and politics must stop treating the
  various actions as “incidents” and connect the dots – for themselves and for
  the broader public. While each individual action might not be anti-democratic,
  they are all connected and together constitute a clear and consistent attack
  on democracy. And while all the institutions still stand, they represent less
  and less the liberal democratic values they were founded on. Cas Mudde is the
