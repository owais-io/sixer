  I have a pair of Beats earbuds I received as a Christmas gift three years ago.
  They have been replaced once for free by Apple when they developed a sound
  issue within the warranty period. Recently, one earbud stopped working. I went
  to an authorised Apple repairer and was told the price of fixing them was
  equivalent to buying a new pair of earbuds. This seems wasteful to me as I’d
  rather repair the broken earbud, and I’m wondering if there is any recourse as
  to a discounted repair fee to encourage device repairs rather than
  replacements. – Alana, Victoria Kat George says: Australia has a rapidly
  growing e-waste problem, so you’re right to challenge tech’s throwaway
  culture. Australians generated 511,000 tonnes of e-waste in 2019, and the
  Australian government projects that will grow by 30% by 2030. Firstly, I
  question whether you should be the one wearing the cost of a repair or a
  replacement. Your rights as a consumer extend beyond the warranty offered by a
  business, in line with the “consumer guarantees” available under the
  Australian Consumer Law. The consumer guarantees cannot be replaced by product
  warranties – any warranties provided for a product are in addition to the
  consumer guarantees. The consumer guarantees require that products are of
  “acceptable quality and durability”. This includes that the product should be
  “durable enough to perform its intended function(s) for a reasonable amount of
  time”. In the case of Beats earbuds, a Google search suggests (anecdotally)
  that this could be anywhere between three and five years. Unless you’ve used
  the Beats in a way other than they were intended, for instance, as
  doorstoppers, or if you’ve done something to damage them, the consumer
  guarantees apply. Importantly in your case, even though your Beats have
  already been replaced, the consumer guarantees apply to the replacement Beats
  the same way they would to the original product. This means you can expect
  that the replacement Beats, from the date of replacement, should be of
  acceptable quality and durability, which it seems they may not be. This
  entitles you to the full protection of the Australian Consumer Law for the
  replacement product, and that includes a replacement, a refund or a repair.
  Rather than going to an authorised repairer, go directly to Apple. Call
  Apple’s customer service, but also put your case to Apple in writing,
  including the details of your purchase and initial replacement. Let Apple know
  it is responsible for the faulty product and that you’d like a repair. Apple
  could offer to repair the product for you (at no cost to you) or reimburse the
  cost of the repair. Either way, this should be agreed with Apple in advance of
  you taking any more steps to facilitate the repair of the Beats yourself. If
  Apple doesn’t help you with a repair, complain to ACCC or Consumer Affairs
  Victoria. One of these consumer watchdogs should be able to take on your case
  and communicate with Apple on your behalf to resolve the dispute. Your final
  recourse is to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). VCAT is
  an expensive and time-consuming process, so it may not be worth it for the
  sake of an earbud, unless you are really set on standing on principle. Ask Kat
  a question Do you have an Australian consumer problem you’d like Kat’s advice
  about? Fill out the form below to let us know.
