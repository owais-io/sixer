  News Corp is warning Donald Trump that AI is cannibalizing the content of his
  books, including The Art of the Deal. The company, owned by billionaire Rupert
  Murdoch, owns dozens of newspapers and TV channels around the world including
  the Wall Street Journal, the Times (in the UK), the Australian and the New
  York Post. News Corp also owns book publisher HarperCollins, which has
  published three of Trump’s books, though his best-known title, The Art of the
  Deal, was published by Random House. Still, the company appeared keen to warn
  Trump about the impact AI is having on publishing. “The AI age must cherish
  the value of intellectual property if we are collectively to realize our
  potential,” News Corp said in a statement with its fourth-quarter earnings
  report. “Even the president of the United States is not immune to blatant
  theft. The president’s books are still reporting healthy sales, but are being
  consumed by AI engines which profit from his thoughts by cannibalizing his
  concepts, thus undermining future sales of his books. “Suddenly, The Art of
  the Deal has become The Art of the Steal.” Media outlets have sued AI
  companies, including OpenAI, operator of ChatGPT, for using their content to
  train AI models without permission. In May, a federal judge rejected OpenAI’s
  request to dismiss a lawsuit from the New York Times over its usage of the
  newspaper’s content. Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, and
  the New York Post sued Perplexity AI in October over similar copyright claims.
  News Corp’s message to Trump also comes after the White House last month
  announced Trump’s “AI action plan” that would see the loosening of AI
  regulations that had been put in place under the Biden administration. In an
  earnings call on Tuesday, the News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said that the
  company is in the middle of “advanced negotiations with several AI companies”.
  “It’s clear that many of them have come to recognize that the purchase of
  [intellectual property] is as important as the acquisition of semiconductors
  or the securing of stable energy sources,” he said, noting that it’s a mix of
  “wooing and suing”. “We prefer the former, but we will never shy away from
  protecting our property rights,” he said. The warning comes at a tense moment
  between News Corp and the White House. Trump sued the Wall Street Journal
  after the newspaper published a report that the president had once sent
  Jeffrey Epstein an intimate birthday message that included a sexually
  suggestive drawing of a woman. Trump claimed that the report was false and
  amounted to libel. The newspaper has requested a judge dismiss the case.
  Murdoch, who also owns Fox News, was once friendly with Trump, though
  relations soured during the president’s third presidential campaign. The
  company beat fourth-quarter expectations with Tuesday’s earnings announcement,
  largely due to a rise in digital subscriptions from Dow Jones, which houses
  the company’s business publications like the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s and
  MarketWatch. On Monday, News Corp announced it will launch a sister tabloid to
  the New York Post in California, called the California Post, in early 2026.
