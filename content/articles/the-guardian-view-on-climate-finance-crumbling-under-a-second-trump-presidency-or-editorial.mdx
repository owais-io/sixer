  The Guardian view on climate finance: crumbling under a second Trump

  Earlier this month, as Nordic countries were hit with an unprecedented
  heatwave and wildfires in the US began spurting “fire clouds”, Barclays pulled
  out of the net zero banking alliance. The story may have seemed less alarming
  than extreme weather, but it has existential implications, as the finance
  sector quietly surrenders its former climate commitments. The initiative forms
  part of the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a voluntary network
  of banks that Mark Carney, formerly the UN’s special envoy on climate action
  and now Canada’s prime minister, launched in 2021. At the time, the alliance,
  which encourages banks and asset managers to work towards the goals of the
  Paris agreement, seemed like an optimistic step in the right direction. Mr
  Carney described it as a “breakthrough”. But times change. The election of
  Donald Trump, whose advisers have waged war on “climate fanaticism” and “woke”
  capitalism, has created an environment of impunity where businesses no longer
  need to even pay lip service to progress. Fossil fuel companies donated $19m
  to Mr Trump’s inauguration fund. So far, their investment has paid off. Mr
  Trump has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, used an “invented” energy
  emergency to justify the expansion of fossil fuels, opened public lands to
  drilling, and plans to cut funding for renewable energy. With America reneging
  on climate action, businesses may feel they can relax. Barclays is the second
  British bank to leave the net zero alliance after HSBC quit earlier this year.
  Six of the largest US banks quit just weeks before Mr Trump’s inauguration.
  Some institutions have come under direct pressure from the right: BlackRock
  left the net zero asset managers initiative, another GFANZ group, after it was
  sued by Republicans who claimed its promotion of environmental, social and
  governance (ESG) goals had cut coal production. In each of his annual investor
  letters from 2020 to 2024, BlackRock’s chair, Larry Fink, namechecked climate
  change. His 2025 letter made no mention of it. The deterioration of GFANZ
  reveals the weaknesses in relying on businesses to do the right thing. Its
  goals were always fuzzy: instead of calling for hard limits on the financing
  of fossil fuels, GFANZ encouraged banks to invest in low-carbon sectors. It
  has since drifted further from its mission, expanding its membership to
  companies without net zero commitments. Though it was never supposed to be a
  substitute for government action, inactive governments welcomed it. Boris
  Johnson, prime minister at the time of its creation, promised the alliance
  would help to “build back greener”. Many green finance initiatives have less
  to do with preventing climate breakdown than minimising investors’ exposure to
  the risks this creates, such as carbon taxes or curbs on fossil fuels. “Green
  ethical investing”, writes Adrienne Buller, is a way of betting “on the
  likelihood of a greener economy, rather than contribute to bringing that
  economy into being”. When the risk of regulation wanes, as it has under Trump,
  so too does the impetus for this style of investing. The lesson is that
  government action (and inaction) will determine the severity of the climate
  crisis. Governments need to prohibit fossil fuel extraction, reduce profits
  through progressive carbon taxes, support renewables and confront powerful
  interests. The myth that businesses are capable of self-policing has led to a
  dangerous delay.
