  An eight-year-old child suffered “a significant amount of blood loss” after he
  was bitten by a shark as he was snorkelling near Key Largo on Monday,
  authorities in Florida said. The boy survived and was taken by helicopter to
  hospital in Miami for treatment to a leg wound above the knee. His condition
  was unknown on Tuesday morning, but local media reports described his wounds
  as “severe”. According to the Monroe county sheriff’s office, the shark attack
  occurred on Monday afternoon as the boy was in the water near Horseshoe Reef.
  The type of shark was not established, but several species are prevalent in
  the Florida Keys, including bonnethead sharks, blacktip sharks and bull
  sharks, one of which bit a 37-year-old man as he was spearfishing near Key
  West in July 2024. The Miami news outlet WSVN reported emergency dispatch
  communications about Monday’s incident, including an initial assessment from
  medical responders. “So, we have an eight-year-old … significant amount of
  blood loss. Patient is pale,” one responder reported. “He’s been applied two
  tourniquets, we also put [on a] bandage to control the bleeding.” Florida
  leads the US and the world in unprovoked shark bites, according to the
  international shark attack file maintained by the University of Florida’s
  museum of natural history. Of the 47 unprovoked bites recorded worldwide in
  2024, 28 were in the US, with 14 of those occurring in Florida. An analysis of
  shark bites between 1642 and 2024 – published recently by the website
  Tideschart – showed that incidents are still relatively rare. Eight Florida
  beaches appear in the top 10 in the US, with a combined 535 incidents over
  almost four centuries. New Smyrna Beach, the self-styled shark bite capital of
  the world, leads the list with 277. Another monitoring website,
  trackingsharks.com, recorded 43 shark bite attacks globally in 2025 up to
  mid-August, with eight of them fatal, four in Australia. The most recently
  recorded shark death in the US was in June 2024, when actor Tamayo Perry, who
  appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean, was killed while he was surfing in Oahu.
