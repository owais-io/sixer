  Name: Homebuyer sleepovers. Age: Newish. Appearance: Imagine liking an Airbnb
  so much that you decide to live there. I’d love to do that, if only to see
  what is kept in the obligatory Locked Cupboard of Mystery. Well, great. Start
  looking around on Zoopla and see how it goes. Really? Sure. According to the
  Wall Street Journal, more and more people are refusing to buy a house until
  they’ve spent a full night there. In a house they don’t own? Correct. Because
  they want to see if it’s haunted? Well, it’s usually because they want to see
  if the house will suit their needs, but sure, people may also want to stay
  over in a prospective new home to make sure it isn’t riddled with ghosts. And
  the current homeowners are OK with this? More often than not, yes. Selling a
  home can be gruelling, so why not speed it up by letting some strangers spend
  the night? I don’t know, it sounds quite subversive to me. Does it? Or does
  the current way of buying a house make absolutely no sense? What do you mean?
  Last year it was reported that a fifth of buyers make an offer after looking
  at a place for less than 20 minutes. The biggest purchase of their lives, and
  they don’t have enough time to check if the walls are too thin or the water
  pressure sucks or the neighbours perform noisy satanic rituals in their garden
  every night. Come to mention it, my neighbours do perform a lot of rituals.
  See? And you would have known that if you had slept at the house for the
  night. I suppose houses are quite expensive. Quite? In the UK, the average
  home currently costs 7.9 times the median annual earnings of a full-time
  employee, up from 3.6 times in the 1990s. And renting is just as bad. People
  spend an average of 36.3% of their earnings on rent, up from just 8% in the
  1960s. So if you’re buying a house, it’s best to be absolutely certain. And
  staying over is free? That depends. Quite often the terms have to be worked
  out by lawyers in advance. Some homeowners allow a night if the potential
  buyers bring their own mattresses. Others will clear out entirely and let the
  buyers rent the place at market value for a couple of months before they make
  a decision. You would definitely know if the place was haunted after two
  months. Why are you so obsessed with ghosts? Have you tried searching
  Rightmove for the term “definitely not haunted”? It’s next to useless. That
  does seem to be the determining factor for the housing crisis, you’re right.
  Do say: “Thinking of buying a home? Sleep over.” Don’t say: “Drive down living
  costs by looking at 365 houses a year.” • Do you have an opinion on the issues
  raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300
