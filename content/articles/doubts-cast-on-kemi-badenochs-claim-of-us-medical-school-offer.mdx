  Doubts have surfaced over Kemi Badenoch’s claim to have been offered a place
  at a prestigious US medical school at 16, with admissions staff unable to
  recall the proposal and the university not providing the course. The
  Conservative leader has said in interviews that she was offered a place and a
  partial scholarship to study medicine – sometimes describing it as
  pre-medicine – at Stanford University in California, one of the most
  competitive in the US. However, medicine is only offered to graduates at
  Stanford and there is no pre-med degree. When asked for clarification, the
  Conservatives then said Badenoch had not applied but had been offered the
  place by a number of US universities – including Stanford – on the basis of
  good exam results in US standardised tests. But academic and admissions
  experts have cast doubt on this, saying it was an impossible scenario. Jon
  Reider, the Stanford admissions officer at the time of Badenoch’s application
  who was responsible for international students and the allocation of
  bursaries, said he would have been responsible for offering Badenoch a place
  and had not done so. Badenoch moved to the UK from Nigeria aged 16. “Although
  30 years have passed, I would definitely remember if we had admitted a
  Nigerian student with any financial aid. The answer is that we did not do so,”
  he said. Reider said he had admitted a few students based in Africa during
  that period but not from Nigeria. “I assure you that we would not have
  admitted a student based on test scores alone, nor would we have mailed an
  invitation to apply to any overseas students based on test scores,” he said.
  He added: “O-levels would not have been sufficient, and we would have been
  very nervous admitting a 16-year-old. She would have had to have an
  extraordinary record.” Reider also revealed it was implausible for a student
  to be offered a partial scholarship they could not afford to take up. “If an
  applicant needed, say, $30,000 a year to attend Stanford, we would offer them
  the full amount. There was no point in offering them less because they would
  not have been able to attend. If we admitted them, we wanted them to enrol,”
  he said. “We were very generous and could offer only about 30 full
  scholarships a year. Some turned us down for Harvard, Yale. I made the
  selections myself, subject to the approval of the dean. I was never overruled
  by any of the three deans for whom I worked.” The Guardian has also consulted
  Ivy League admissions coaches, an author specialising in college admissions,
  several Stanford graduates and an Ivy League vice-provost. All of those who
  spoke to the Guardian said they did not believe it was plausible for a place
  to be offered proactively on exam results alone. One senior US academic said
  he had never heard of any exemptions – not even for internationally renowned
  child prodigies or royalty. Badenoch first mentioned her admission to Stanford
  in an interview with the Huffington Post in 2017, when she had just been
  elected as the Conservative MP for Saffron Walden. Asked what she wanted to be
  when she was 16, she said: “A doctor, like my parents. Going to a very bad
  school here stopped me. I had actually got admission into medical school in
  the US – I got into Stanford pre-med – and I got into medical school in
  Nigeria but I came here because being a citizen, it was just a lot cheaper.”
  Additional detail was given in an interview with the Times in 2024. The
  interview says: “At 16, her US SAT scores won her a partial pre-med
  scholarship to Stanford, but her family still couldn’t afford the place.” The
  claim that Badenoch had an early offer from Stanford has been mentioned in
  numerous other newspaper articles. In a profile in the Spectator in 2020, it
  says Badenoch “won a part-scholarship to Stanford University to study
  medicine”. The same claim is made in a profile in the Daily Mail by Lord
  Ashcroft last year, previewing his biography of Badenoch. On its website, the
  university says: “Stanford does not have a pre-med major. For any of the
  health professions, you may major in any discipline.” Medicine is a graduate
  degree. A Conservative party source said it was a common colloquialism to
  refer to taking a science undergraduate degree as “pre-med” and that Badenoch
  was using this terminology having spent time in the US. After further
  questions, the Conservative party said Badenoch had not in fact applied
  directly to Stanford but had received a number of offers from US, UK and
  Nigerian universities – including Stanford – when she received good SAT
  results. A spokesperson for Badenoch said: “Nearly 30 years ago, and aged 16,
  Kemi was offered a part-scholarship at Stanford that her parents couldn’t
  afford to take up. “But, given her subsequent degrees in both engineering and
  law are a matter of public record, she questions the hysterical efforts to
  disprove this, from people who showed little interest in probing Rachel
  Reeves’s hole-filled CV that has contributed to the economic crisis engulfing
  our country.” Irena Smith, another former Stanford admissions officer who
  began there in 1999 and authored the memoir The Golden Ticket, said: “Based on
  my experience, students with high SAT scores might have been encouraged to
  apply, but would not have received an offer of admission without completing an
  application, which would include a list of their activities, teacher letters
  of recommendation, and multiple essays. “I have not, however, ever heard of a
  student being offered a spot at Stanford based on high SAT scores alone,
  without submitting a full application.” The Liberal Democrats said Badenoch
  should reveal the full story behind her apparent offer. A party spokesperson
  said: “Kemi Badenoch spent months asking questions of the chancellor regarding
  her CV. It’s now time for her to answer some of her own.” Badenoch has spoken
  in the past how she felt she was let down by poor British teaching in her
  final school years, having moved to the UK as the political situation in
  Nigeria deteriorated. Aged 16, she was studying part-time at Phoenix College,
  a further education college in Morden, achieving a B in biology, a B in
  chemistry and a D in maths. She says she had previously been a straight-A
  student but was repeatedly put down and underestimated by teachers at the
  college and discouraged from applying for medicine or to the University of
  Oxford. Stanford University did not return requests for comment.
