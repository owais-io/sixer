  As Democrats continue to sift through the wreckage of the 2024 election, one
  truth should be impossible to ignore: they are bleeding support among
  working-class voters and Donald Trump’s stumbles alone will not save them.
  From Black and Latino men to young and low-income voters, Trump’s re-election
  made it clear that working Americans increasingly feel alienated from the
  Democratic party. Democrats today might not be as sanguine about sidelining
  the working class as Chuck Schumer was before the 2016 election, when he
  claimed that for every blue-collar voter Democrats lost, they could pick up
  two college-educated Republicans. But it’s clear that many Democrats still
  don’t see winning back working-class voters as essential – either to defeat
  Maga or to build durable, majoritarian progressive coalitions for the future.
  A new report from the Center for Working-Class Politics (CWCP) and Jacobin
  magazine, based on an analysis of hundreds of public opinion questions
  spanning six decades, suggests that blue-collar voters are not out of reach –
  if Democrats are willing to lead with economic populism. The report shows that
  American workers have long supported – and still overwhelmingly favor – a bold
  progressive economic agenda. If Democrats placed these policies consistently
  at the heart of their platform, they could not only improve conditions in
  working-class communities but also begin to rebuild trust with the very voters
  they need most. Progressive economic reforms – from raising the federal
  minimum wage and implementing a federal jobs guarantee to expanding social
  security, taxing the rich, and investing in public goods such as education and
  infrastructure – are supported not only by Democratic-leaning voters but also
  by substantial segments of Donald Trump’s base. And while national Democrats
  remain unsure how to reconnect with these voters, a new generation of economic
  populists across the country is already showing the way. In New York City,
  Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic mayoral primary campaigning to tax the rich,
  fund public goods and confront corporate landlords. In Nebraska, independent
  union leader Dan Osborn – a mechanic and labor activist – ran on a tight
  platform of workers’ rights and corporate accountability and over-performed
  Kamala Harris by 14 points in a deep-red state. In difficult House swing
  districts, Democrats are leaning into economic populism with promising
  results. In Pennsylvania’s 17th district, Chris Deluzio, a representative and
  navy veteran, champions “economic patriotism”, calling out economic elites and
  damaging trade agreements while pushing to rebuild domestic industry and
  strengthen labor rights. In New Mexico’s second district, Gabe Vasquez has
  built his platform around a sharp critique of corporate greed – condemning
  CEOs and wealthy investors for inflating profits while shortchanging workers –
  and has pushed for a $15 minimum wage and cutting taxes for working families.
  Meanwhile, in Wisconsin’s third district, Democrat Rebecca Cooke – a waitress
  and small business owner who grew up on a dairy farm – is mounting a 2026
  comeback bid after over-performing other Democrats and losing by less than
  three points in 2024, running on a platform that targets corporate price
  gouging, expands affordable rural housing and defends family farms. These
  candidates come from different regions and backgrounds, and hold diverse
  ideological positions, but nonetheless share a core political strategy: they
  are highly disciplined economic populists who speak to working-class voters in
  language that’s grounded, direct and relatable. And, contrary to many centrist
  pundits, while they do need to avoid fringe rhetoric, Democrats don’t have to
  embrace social conservatism to do it. The CWCP study shows that while
  working-class voters are generally to the right of middle-class voters on
  cultural issues, most hold moderate, and in some cases even progressive, views
  on issues such as immigration, abortion and civil rights. These voters do not
  want Democrats to mimic Republicans on controversial wedge issues, but they do
  want a commonsense message focused on the economic realities of working
  Americans. Yet working-class voters don’t just embrace politicians who support
  the right policies. Our previous research shows that they want leaders who
  understand people like them, share a similar class background and speak
  plainly about what they’ll do and why it matters. The path to winning back
  working-class voters runs through authenticity, clarity and a credible
  commitment to improving people’s lives. Unfortunately, the national party has
  been slow to adapt. Harris’s 2024 campaign offered ambitious economic
  proposals that could have benefited millions of working Americans. But as the
  race wore on, she grew increasingly reluctant to lead with economic populism,
  instead doubling down on a strategy rooted in fear of Trump. That may have
  comforted donors and consultants, but it left many working-class voters cold –
  and opened the door for Republicans to posture as the party of the people.
  This vacuum has given Republicans room to pose as economic populists, despite
  an agenda that overwhelmingly serves corporations and the wealthy. Trump’s
  so-called Big Beautiful Bill Act delivered massive tax cuts for the rich while
  masquerading as a working-class boon. House Republicans have attacked union
  protections and slashed social welfare programs – moves wildly out of step
  with working-class preferences. But without a compelling Democratic
  alternative, the right’s billionaire populism can take hold. If Democrats want
  to rebuild a durable majority, they need candidates who stay focused on
  populist economics and steer clear of the culture wars. Reversing the
  Democratic party’s working-class decline will not be solved by platitudes or
  photo ops with hard hats. It demands a real shift in priorities. It means
  crafting campaigns that focus relentlessly on tangible economic outcomes and
  elevating candidates who reflect the experience of the working class. And it
  demands a clear, consistent message that puts class and dignity back at the
  center of Democratic politics. Jared Abbott is the director of the Center for
