  the Australia Institute

  Andrew Forrest’s charity has made an undisclosed donation to the Australia
  Institute, raising transparency concerns about the funding of influential
  advocacy groups. The donation to the progressive thinktank, which has been
  confirmed by several sources familiar with the deal but not authorised to
  comment, highlights differing disclosure standards across the research and
  advocacy sector. The institute, which lobbies for policy change, did not
  confirm or deny funding from Minderoo. But two sources described the donation
  as “substantial” and one alleged it was worth “six figures”. Minderoo did not
  disclose the value of its support. It is unclear when the donation was made,
  and there is no suggestion it influenced the institute’s conduct. Nor is there
  any suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of the institute or Minderoo in
  respect of the donation. The institute’s public campaigns on emissions
  reduction are closely aligned to those run by the mining magnate’s charity and
  his company, Fortescue, which has publicly lobbied the Albanese government.
  The Australia Institute, Minderoo and Fortescue have all criticised the use of
  carbon offsets to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and have instead championed
  a “real zero” strategy, which calls for total decarbonisation. Minderoo, which
  was founded by Forrest and his partner Nicola in 2001, lists the promotion of
  the real zero strategy as a key focus. Its website carries quotes from Forrest
  including his criticism of net zero as a “meaningless mantra that just buys
  companies and governments time while they continue to burn fossil fuels”.
  Forrest was Minderoo’s co-chair until September 2024, when he became a
  non-executive director. When announcing the change, Forrest said it would
  enable him to “focus on driving the global adoption of real zero”. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Fortescue, which was founded by Forrest in 2003, has
  committed to achieving real zero emissions in its own operations by 2030 and
  has campaigned for other companies to follow. In February, Fortescue organised
  an open letter calling on the government to introduce a real zero policy,
  which was welcomed by the Australia Institute. In the same month, Fortescue’s
  chief climate scientist outlined the real zero approach at a summit organised
  by the institute. In recent months, the institute has praised Forrest’s
  commitment to real zero and called on the rest of industry to “get on the same
  path”. An Australia Institute spokesperson said its research was independent
  and that “protecting the privacy of our donors is important”. “Unfortunately,
  in Australia, some donors to other charities have been targeted, rather than
  praised, by powerful voices for their generous support for work designed to
  highlight the problems of rising inequity and greenhouse gas emissions,” the
  spokesperson said. Similar reasons for withholding the names of donors have
  been used by the conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA).
  In 2012 the IPA said it did not reveal donors as they had previously been
  “intimidated” by political opponents. Other research groups do disclose
  donors. The Grattan Institute lists all financial supporters, including
  individuals, who provide more than $1,000. The Centre for Public Integrity
  lists key funders on the second page of research reports. John Daley, who was
  the founding chief executive of the Grattan Institute from 2009 to 2020, said
  think tanks “had a status in public debate” and their donors should be
  disclosed as a matter of transparency. Speaking generally, not in relation to
  the Australia Institute, Daley said he was not convinced of the need to keep
  donors secret. “If they are subject to an attack as they look like they are
  trying to buy a thinktank, then I am not very sympathetic,” Daley said. “If
  they are subject to attack for other reasons, it’s hard to see why that would
  be so unpleasant. “We force people to disclose donations to political parties
  and they go ahead and do it.” The Australia Institute spokesperson said: “We
  barrack for ideas not political parties and, in turn, do not accept donations
  from political parties, nor would the Australia Institute accept donations to
  fund work that conflicts with or seeks to direct our research.” A Fortescue
  spokesperson said the company had never donated to the Australia Institute and
  that there was “clear separation between Minderoo and Fortescue, with robust
  government systems and policies in place”. A Minderoo spokesperson said the
  charity was an entirely separate organisation to Fortescue and that its
  “climate advocacy is underpinned by rigorous and evidence-based research”.
  They said the charity was “free from commercial influence and guided solely by
  evidence, public interest, and long-term impact”. A 2015 report by the group
  Transparify, which tracks the transparency of thinktank funding globally,
  found Australia had a “remarkably opaque policy research landscape”.
  “Thinktanks can play a positive role producing independent, in-depth policy
  research to inform politicians, media and the public,” said Hans Gutbrod,
  Transparify’s executive director. “As key players in democratic politics, they
  have a responsibility to be transparent about their operations.” • Do you know
