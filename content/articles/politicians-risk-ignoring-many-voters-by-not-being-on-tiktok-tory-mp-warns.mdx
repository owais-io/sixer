  Politicians are at risk of ignoring a large chunk of the electorate because of
  their reluctance to communicate on TikTok, according to a Tory MP who has one
  of the biggest followings of any UK politician on the social media platform.
  Luke Evans, who is the sixth-most followed UK politician on TikTok, said his
  colleagues were missing out on engaging particularly with young voters because
  of security concerns and a lack of knowledge about the platform. TikTok has
  been Britain’s fastest-growing source of news for several years. The regulator
  Ofcom calculates that 11% of adults in the UK use the platform as a news
  source. Among children aged 12-15, the proportion is 30%, of whom 12% cite
  TikTok as their main source. “You’ve got to be where the electorate are,”
  Evans told the Guardian. “This is one of the biggest apps that is used across
  the country and across the word. I think it’s right to be there, to be talking
  to people. “And from a party political point of view, if you’re crowded out
  and you’re not speaking to people, that space will get filled. Hearing 20% of
  someone versus nothing from someone else is huge.” Only 10% of Conservative
  MPs use TikTok, according to a recent Guardian analysis, compared with nearly
  25% of their Labour colleagues. In 2023, Rishi Sunak’s government banned
  TikTok on government devices because of concerns over how the platform’s
  Chinese owners would treat user data. In comparison, those on the populist
  right and left are far more active on the platform – chief among them Nigel
  Farage, who has 1.3 million followers. Jeremy Corbyn has 223,000, while Zarah
  Sultana, the co-leader of his new party, has nearly 480,000. With 52,000
  followers, Evans’ profile is much smaller, but it makes him the most followed
  Conservative MP on the platform, and one of a rare group who have carved out a
  presence on it from the centre-right of politics. As a trained GP, Evans said
  it led to him being recognised as the “TikTok doctor MP” in bars, constituency
  events and even once, on a tourist bus in Iceland. He said he had carved out a
  niche in part by answering simple, non-partisan questions about the way
  parliament worked – something he said traditional political communication
  often failed to do. Evans urged other MPs also to use the platform to talk
  more about the basics of their day jobs. “I come as an outsider to
  Westminster, I certainly thought, I don’t understand how the processes work,”
  he said. “Maybe I could educate people on that basis. “Let’s explain what
  happens when an MP wants to pass a bill, or how do they ask a question, all
  the simple things that you go ask, and there was an amazing appetite for it,
  and that created a rolling avalanche of interest, with people asking more and
  more questions.” He added: “It very much lends itself to being able to answer
  questions quickly, give people advice, talk about nuances. Voting records was
  an interesting one – trying to explain the idea of how voting records work,
  because people don’t understand that.” Evans’s most popular video, with 2m
  views, is one in which he stands up in the Commons and reads out a poem
  written about Queen Elizabeth after her death. He said he decided to read the
  poem after seeing it trending on social media and realising it had the
  potential to resonate more than some of the personal anecdotes about the queen
  that other MPs were sharing. “I was very tired when I got there, but I
  thought: ‘You know what, let’s try it,’” he said. “And so I read it out and
  cut it up [edited it]. You put some music on it, and very, very quickly it
  picked up.” But Evans also warned about the impact that TikTok was having on
  some young men in particular, whom he said were being ignored by mainstream
  politicians and finding solace instead in extreme social media content and
  influencers. “Andrew Tate was very good at playing into that,” Evans said,
  referring to the self-styled “misogynist influencer”. He added: “One of the
  commonest trends about 18 months ago was a woman on the screen asking men:
  ‘Guys, when times are tough, who do you talk to?’ “And it was just reposted
  repeatedly with young men saying ‘no one’, ‘there’s no one there’, ‘no one
  cares’, ‘no one listens’. Man after man after man just coming up and lining
  that up. It’s really harrowing, because they’re genuine, raw videos, and it
  cuts through.” But turning to his colleagues, Evans said that despite concerns
  about harmful content and the platform’s Chinese owners,politicians needed to
  be on TikTok to understand what many people were thinking. “People will
  naturally lead you where you need to look,” he said. “In the old days, they
  used to write to us. In recent times, they’ll email us. Now it’s social media
  trends.”
