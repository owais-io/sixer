  and changing how we eat

  Good morning. My mum is a livestock farmer in Kent. This year her hay crop was
  down by 50% because the spring rains never came. She’s not alone – up and down
  the UK, farmers have watched their fields turn brown and their hay crops
  collapse. Hay keeps animals alive over winter (when there is no fresh grass
  outside) and some farmers are already selling off cows because they can’t
  guarantee they will be able to feed them. From extreme drought to biblical
  floods, more than 80% of UK farmers are worried wild swings in weather are
  affecting their ability to earn a living. Globally, farmers are on the
  frontline of climate change and livelihoods are on the line. Last year,
  heatwaves wiped out onions in India and cocoa in Ivory Coast. Most recently
  wildfires and heatwaves have driven losses of olives, citrus fruits and
  vegetables across Europe. Not only is this bad news for farmers, but supply
  chains are buckling under the pressure, driving an increase in the cost of
  food for consumers. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Dr Maximilian Kotz, a
  Marie Curie postdoctoral research fellow at Barcelona Supercomputing Center,
  about “climateflation” and how environmental breakdown affects the cost of
  what we eat. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war |
  Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday and then struck the
  same place again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded,
  killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.
  UK news | Schools will need to give democracy lessons to children from the age
  of 11 and ask teachers to leave their politics at the classroom door to help
  prepare for votes at 16, the head of the UK elections watchdog has said.
  Health | People using the weight loss jab Mounjaro have been warned against
  switching to black market sellers or bulk buying after its manufacturer
  announced the UK will get a significant price rise this autumn. US news | Some
  national guard units patrolling the US capital at the direction of Donald
  Trump have started carrying firearms, an escalation of the president’s
  military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by
  his defence department. UK news | Ministers are introducing a clearer legal
  definition of “honour-based” abuse in an attempt to catch more perpetrators
  and protect women and girls from violence and coercion. In depth: ‘Consumers
  are starting to see these things directly for themselves’ It has been known
  for a long time that the amount of food a farmer produces is linked to climate
  conditions (hence why farmers are usually clued up to the forecast). This is
  of course natural – weather fluctuates. However, in recent years temperature
  extremes have become stronger, and records are being broken across the globe.
  As a result, a new area of research has started to evolve over the past
  five-ish years: how the climate crisis is affecting the price of food. “In the
  last year or two there have been many widespread examples of this phenomenon
  playing out,” said Maximilian Kotz. “It’s something that people are really
  noticing – not just researchers who look at the data in detail, but people in
  the industry, and even consumers, are starting to see these things directly
  for themselves.” *** What are the effects of wildfires and heatwaves across
  Europe? We’ve all read about wildfires and heatwaves ravaging southern Europe.
  Not only has this had a devastating impact on people’s lives but it has also
  having an concerning impact on food, with farmers struggling to grow crops
  that their forebears did for hundreds of years. This means the price of
  traditional Mediterranean produce such as olives, citrus fruits, vegetables
  and wine are likely to rise. In the UK, long dry spells have also affected the
  production of cereals, potatoes, carrots and broccoli. Britain’s largest
  retailers are warning food prices are already being driven up by hot weather.
  This is not an isolated year, and crop losses are only set to increase in the
  coming years as the climate crisis gets worse. In the EU, the average annual
  loss is expected to increase by up to two-thirds by 2050, according to
  analysis by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission.
  And it’s not just in Europe where agriculture is being hit. Shrivelled cacao
  pods and failed harvests caused by extreme temperatures in west Africa have
  caused an increase in the price of chocolate. Even bananas are not safe –
  rising temperatures, extreme weather and climate-related pests are pummelling
  Guatemala, Costa Rica and Colombia, where the world’s most popular fruit is
  grown. *** What are some examples of price spikes in recent years? Kotz and
  his team looked at data from 18 countries to find examples of price spikes
  associated with extreme weather events. They found that in 2022, vegetable
  prices spiked by 80% in Arizona and California after extreme summer drought.
  In the same year, a drought in the Horn of Africa – the worst there in 40
  years – resulted in food prices being 40% higher in March the following year.
  In 2024, global cocoa prices were 280% higher in April after a heatwave two
  months prior in Ivory Coast and Ghana (together, these two countries account
  for 60% of global cacao production). A heatwave in May of the same year caused
  a 80% increase in the price of onions and potatoes in India. At its most basic
  level, this is an issue of supply and demand: if droughts and heat stress
  destroy crop yields, then prices of that crop go up. Kotz said: “It is quite
  striking that very often the products that are most affected are fresh fruit
  and vegetable produce. There are obvious reasons why that could be the case –
  essentially those are products that are harder to store, and normally they
  have a shorter time span between production and going to the market.” The
  impact on the market is amplified as you can’t stockpile perishable produce,
  whereas grains and rice can be stored to buffer disruption. *** How
  ‘climateflation’ will change the way we eat The term ‘climateflation’ refers
  to the rising cost of living caused by the climate crisis. Fundamentally,
  disruptions to agriculture have an impact on how much people have to fork out
  for food. Extreme weather causes short-term price shocks, but hotter average
  temperatures cause food inflation spikes that can last up to 12 months,
  according to Kotz’s research from last year. “We were able to see that we
  really are going to be expecting persistently higher food prices under future
  temperature increases,” he said. A report from the Autonomy Institute
  thinktank found that increasingly extreme weather could drive up food prices
  by more than a third by 2050 for British consumers. The cost of living crisis
  is already squeezing UK household budgets with high food, energy and housing
  costs, while wages remain stagnant. Food makes up a large share of household
  spending – especially in emerging economies. Typically, healthy food (such as
  fresh fruit and vegetables) is twice as expensive per calorie as less healthy
  food. Research from the Food Foundation has shown that spending on healthy
  products is usually where people cut back in times of food price increases,
  particularly in low-income households. This could exacerbate a range of health
  issues, from malnutrition to chronic diet-related conditions including
  coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancers. Poor diets have also been
  linked to poor mental health, according to the Food Foundation. “We expect
  this kind of food price inflation induced by climate change would most of all
  affect the poorest households,” said Kotz. “That then has many implications
  long-term for wider societal health.” The trend with rising food prices is
  structural, so it will keep building as long as temperatures increase. “It’s
  clear that the main thing that we can do to reduce these impacts is just to
  reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” said Kotz. “Even though it’s very
  obvious, I think it’s always important to bring people’s awareness back to the
  underlying driver.” What else we’ve been reading Knesset member Ofer Cassif
  writes in the Guardian on army reservists refusing to take up arms as Israel’s
  anti-war movement grows bolder. “In private talks between family members or in
  public declarations of objection, more and more Israelis are realising that
  participating in military service is to be complicit,” he says. Charlie

  the ‘friendly’ dolphin is apparently asking people for belly rubs, but also
  “trying to drown” female swimmers. Experts say neither is true and Reggie
