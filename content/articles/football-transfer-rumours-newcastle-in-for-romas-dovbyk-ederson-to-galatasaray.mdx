  Galatasaray?

  Today’s tittle-tattle starts with a Manchester club scrabbling around to
  resolve their goalkeeping situation. City’s Ederson continues to attract
  interest from Galatasaray, and a move could unlock the departure of Gianluigi
  Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain to the Etihad, Sky Sports reports.
  Donnarumma’s people, PSG’s people and City’s people have been in contact to
  thrash out possible details, and further agreeable lunches are anticipated. As
  for Ederson, City say they want to keep him as well but while Al-Nassr’s
  interest in the Brazilian appears to have cooled Galatasaray remain keen and a
  deal could yet happen. Thursday’s Newcastle striker talk has them moving for
  Roma’s Artem Dovbyk, initially on loan. The Serie A club are reportedly open
  to the move becoming permanent but would want at least €30m for the Ukraine
  international, and a purchase obligation clause in the small print of any loan
  deal. It’s been a messy summer for West Ham but they could be seeking to tidy
  it all up a bit by signing Hull’s highly-rated goalkeeper Ivor Pandur to
  bolster a rearguard that’s shipped goals to all and sundry so far this season.
  The Croatian was Hull’s player of the year last term and would be a first-team
  contender at the London Stadium. Another keeper on the Hammers’ radar is
  Botafogo’s John Victor but the Brazilian club will want more than the £6m
  being touted as the fee. On the way out of the London Stadium could be Nayef
  Aguerd, in whom Sunderland have shown strong interest, though Marseille, Milan
  and Roma also have eyes for the Moroccan defender. Aguerd could be joined in
  the West Ham departure lounge by Maxwel Cornet, headed for Genoa, for whom he
  impressed on loan last season. Sunderland meanwhile also fancy Bologna’s
  Colombian defender Jhon Lucimi and are prepared to prove it with an improved
  £24m bid. Do we want to talk about Chelsea and Alejandro Garnacho again? OK,
  well Chelsea have reportedly now agreed personal terms with the Argentina
  winger in a deal that the Telegraph says is in the region of £35m-£40m. Wolves
  are hoping to reinforce their attack with the Genk striker Tolu Arokodare, who
  was the top scorer in Belgium’s top flight last season with 17 goals. The
  Nigerian forward has two years remaining on his contract though so Wolves will
  need to pony up some cash to secure his services. In the Championship,
  free-spending Birmingham are being linked with Celtic’s South Korean winger
  Yang Hyun-jun. He cost the Hoops only £2m two years ago so Birmingham may not
  have to delve too deeply into their voluminous pockets to snare him. And
  finally, a bit of East Anglian transfer needle with Ipswich making a swoop for
  Norwich’s Marcelino Núñez. Ipswich are thought to have offered £10m (plus
  £2.5m in add-ons) of their parachute payment money for the midfielder, whose
  contract at Carrow Road expires next summer. The Norwich manager, Liam
  Manning, has insisted the Chilean is part of his plans, but plans can fall
  through and so often they do.
