  Inspired by the author’s own experience, Kate Riley’s debut novel depicts one
  woman’s life in the US chapter of an international Anabaptist sect. “The
  Brotherhood” is an insular and reactionary society founded by German
  emigrants. All property is held in common and centrally rationed in “a
  constantly recalibrating state of voluntary poverty”; collectivity is so
  rigidly enforced that even the family unit is considered a potential threat,
  with youngsters periodically rehoused in different families. Women (“sisters”)
  are assigned dowdy dresses in order to repress desire, and merely humming a
  tune is a guilty pleasure. This bleak way of life is rendered in a series of
  episodic dispatches, and the title character’s inner life is imparted in a
  free indirect third person as she grapples with doubt, shame and boredom. Ruth
  is knock-kneed and clumsy, prone to malingering and fixated on language. She
  feels guilty if she rehashes a joke – because self-plagiarism might constitute
  “empty speech”, which is a sin. Having been raised in such an austere
  environment, her mind is blown on her first day at a public high school:
  “Enumerating the varieties of blue jeans made her think very seriously of
  infinity … The running list of exotic clothing she’d witnessed … ennobled her
  impulse to stare..” Time and again her thoughts circle back to the riddle of
  visual pleasure. “Beauty was an argument, but for what?” For Stendhal it meant
  the promise of happiness, and it connotes something similar here: life force,
  connection. Ruth is terribly lonely, plagued by a “constant lugubrious
  awareness of her own isolation”; “all she wanted was a friend who knew she was
  suffering but would not make her talk about it”. Instead, she marries a man
  she finds boring, has three children with him and sinks into depression.
  Decades pass in the blink of an eye. On a road trip for their 21st
  anniversary, we find her staring out from the passenger seat like a sullen
  teenager: “Every passing car was an opportunity to project pathos; she made
  eye contact and tried to look like a woman abducted.” This is as much as we
  get by way of overarching narrative: not so much an arc as a flat line. In the
  most enjoyable plotless novels, the rhythms of inner life generate a momentum
  that substitutes for action. Here, Ruth’s diffident consciousness is a
  halting, intermittent presence; on the page as in life, she is overshadowed by
  her environment. Yet although the novel sometimes drags, Riley’s droll,
  sardonic narrative voice keeps the reader on board. She does a nice line in
  adverbial intensifiers: Ruth’s father is “deeply, magnetically pathetic”; a
  dog is “hypnotically dim”; a doctor is a “tiny and turbulently pink little
  man”. There are some memorable, elegantly economical descriptions: we
  encounter “a glossy, ursine sister”, “a cedar barn of a man”, a “squash-like
  cardinal”, and an “extremely vertical” visitor who “fell into handsome lines
  when quiet”. A group of women in an old black-and-white photograph look “like
  rats in kerchiefs”; an enthusiastic bather “hoisted up her skirt and slip and
  rushed into the water like a stung hen”. Riley’s narrator is part wry
  anthropologist, part reluctant memoirist. Hers is very different from the kind
  of candour we have become accustomed to in contemporary fiction: it’s
  essentially withholding, and the emotional payoff is to be found not in the
  explicit excavation of trauma, but in bittersweet moments of levity and
  flights of whimsy. At one point, Ruth considers naming her daughter Idea: “It
  meant her favourite thing; it required only the slightest blunting of the mind
  to sound like it had been a little girl’s name all along. And it had occurred
  unbidden … like relief from hiccups and most angels.” (She doesn’t go through
  with it.) Literary culture has become so mired in therapeutic discourse that
  we’ve almost forgotten there are other, subtler ways to explore pain.
  Reticence, dissociation, quiet quitting: these are the unsung heroes of
  self-care, as Riley’s protagonist can vouch. “Ruth detached with ease; her
  life was one long, loud Velcro release from the world.” • Ruth by Kate Riley
  is published by Doubleday (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy
