  Congresswoman Nancy Mace, a once moderate Republican turned Trump loyalist,
  officially launched her bid for governor of South Carolina on Monday.
  Currently serving her third term in Congress, Mace, 47, was once a Trump
  critic. Now, per the Associated Press, she calls herself “Trump in high heels”
  and promises to be a “super Maga governor” in the largely Republican state.
  Mace’s video announcement launching her bid for the South Carolina GOP
  gubernatorial primary on Monday focused heavily on her pro-Trump credentials,
  featuring a clip of the president calling her a “fighter”. She calls for a
  “zero-tolerance approach to crime”, cutting the state income tax to zero and
  stopping “the radical gender agenda” and “woke ideology” in South Carolina’s
  schools. The new campaign cements her Trump-era transformation. The
  representative for South Carolina’s first congressional district was one of
  seven House Republicans who signed a letter in 2021 saying Congress did not
  have the authority to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Trump’s
  favor. She was also highly critical of his role in the January 6 attack on the
  US Capitol. Trump subsequently endorsed a primary opponent to Mace’s 2022
  congressional campaign, which she ultimately still won, calling her an
  “absolutely terrible candidate”. She has since become a fierce ally of the US
  president, especially on so-called culture war issues, such as transgender
  rights, and his extreme immigration policies. Trump and the freshly Maga-fied
  Mace went on to endorse each other in the 2024 election. Just last week, Mace
  was criticised for disclosing that she loves to cruise the web for videos of
  US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents dragging people into
  custody, saying she “can think of nothing more American”. She told Fox Report
  Weekend host Jon Scott that she was championing proposed legislation that
  would “defund and take tax breaks away” from US cities that restrict how much
  local authorities cooperate with federal immigration officials. Prior to that,
  Mace seized national headlines through her vocal opposition to transgender
  women being allowed to use women’s restrooms. Though as recently as 2023 she
  had described herself as “pro transgender rights”, she has since made being
  anti-trans rights a core part of her political personality. Mace has, for
  instance, repeatedly directly attacked the first openly trans member of
  Congress, US House member Sarah McBride of Delaware, who first took office in
  January. Last year she targeted McBride by introducing a resolution to ban
  transgender women from using the women’s restrooms at the Capitol. “We will
  not fund any schools that allow biological men in women’s bathrooms or locker
  rooms, that allow men to compete in women’s sports, or schools that push
  gender ideology,” she added. She now enters a crowded GOP primary in which
  competition for Trump’s endorsement – and the backing of his base of
  supporters – is expected to be fierce, and in which there isn’t yet a clear
  frontrunner. Among the other candidates are the state’s attorney general Alan
  Wilson, its lieutenant governor Pamela Evette, and US representative Ralph
  Norman, one of the most conservative members of the House. The incumbent
  governor isn’t allowed to seek another term. “I’m running for governor because
  South Carolina doesn’t need another empty suit and needs a governor who will
  fight for you and your values,” Mace said during a launch event at the Citadel
  military college in Charleston. She became the first woman to graduate from
  the Citadel in 1999. “South Carolina needs a governor who will drag the truth
  into sunlight and flip the tables if that’s what it takes,” Mace said.
