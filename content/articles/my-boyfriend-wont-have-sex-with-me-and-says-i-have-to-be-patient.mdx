  My boyfriend and I have been together for a few months. The first time we were
  physically intimate it took him almost an hour to just kiss me because he was
  shaking so much. He hasn’t had physical contact with anyone for four years. He
  says his last breakup was traumatic. Since then, he has found it hard to
  maintain an erection, even while watching porn. When we are together, I touch
  him and myself and, when I’m close to climax, I give him oral sex so we orgasm
  together. He doesn’t kiss me any more and doesn’t touch me intimately, apart
  from my breasts. He says I have to be patient because he hasn’t had sex for
  years. He cannot understand why he is not able to maintain an erection with
  me. I am starting to feel self-conscious and cheap. I am bigger than his
  normal type and I feel like this is the problem. I asked him why he’s with me;
  he says it’s because he can spend hours talking to me, and he feels
  comfortable with me. Should I be patient with him or am I setting myself up
  for heartbreak? You have set yourself up as his caretaker and, while that may
  be fulfilling for you in many ways, it is probably not erotically inspiring.
  It has also made you question the unspoken contract between you … which seems
  to be: you take care of him in every possible way but he does little to
  reciprocate. If this is correct, I can certainly understand if you are feeling
  that you deserve more. Would you say you have healthy self-esteem? Some people
  put up with this kind of contract because, deep down, they do not believe they
  deserve – or can receive – better. Think carefully about why you have come to
  be in this position and whether or not it is what you truly want. You can
  always negotiate for more attention, more kindness, more appreciation or
  anything else you feel he could give you but withholds. Make him recognise
  just how special you are, and how lucky he is to have you in his life. Pamela
