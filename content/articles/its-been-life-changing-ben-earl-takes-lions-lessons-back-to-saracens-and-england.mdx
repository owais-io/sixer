  After the British &amp; Irish Lions failed to complete the clean sweep they
  were seeking in Sydney, the head coach, Andy Farrell, conceded it might take
  one or two beers before his players felt a sense of pride in their
  achievements. For Ben Earl, you sense it did not take as long as that. Earl
  gave a glowing endorsement of his first Lions tour – he appeared as a
  replacement in the first and third Tests – passionately expressing the hope he
  features on the next one and explaining why he returns to Saracens and England
  a much-improved player. The key, according to the 27-year-old back-rower, is
  essentially to go with the flow. He cites as an example that on the way to the
  stadium last Saturday the door on the team bus became jammed and as a result
  the Lions had to decamp to another. In other, more highly strung environments,
  disruption like that can have a derailing effect, but Earl’s eyes have been
  opened to a world where not everything has to be perfect or prescriptive. To
  that end, it was instructive to hear he has spoken to England colleagues about
  bringing a similar attitude when they reconvene in October. “Just get out of
  your own way,” he says. “You can overthink this sport so much but when you’ve
  got a game on Saturday, then you’ve got to play again on Tuesday or Wednesday,
  you’re not going to be able to do every rep, review everything opposition. Get
  out of your own way and just play rugby. “It’s almost like you get to the
  pinnacle of our sport – this is what it is – and you’re back playing under-12s
  on a Sunday morning. There’s no preparation, you just go out, you have a plan,
  you try to implement it, you express yourself in a way Andy and the rest of
  the coaching staff have allowed us to do and I’ve loved every minute of it.
  “It’s been a life-changing experience, the highlight of my life, certainly my
  rugby-playing life. I’ve made friends for life, memories for life. It showed
  me something completely different in terms of the rugby side of things. I’ve
  loved it. It has been completely transformative for me and I’m a far better
  player because of it. “I’ve spoken to fellow Englishmen that there’s some cool
  stuff we can bring back to camp and that’s sort of the whole point, isn’t it?
  We can come back and say, ‘there are some bits we’ve done here that work when
  we have time away or during campaigns’. “I’m almost excited to get going
  again. I need my time off, but I’m almost excited to get back into certain
  environments to be like, ‘have you thought about this?’.” Earl is equally
  effusive about Farrell’s coaching style. The Ireland head coach led the Lions
  to a first series win in 12 years on his first tour in the top job. “He has
  made me fully believe in how good I am,” says Earl. “Every time he talks to
  the group, I’m like, I’ll do anything for that man, I’m ready to play. Even
  when I’m not playing. Every time he spoke to the group, I’m like, when the
  time comes, I’m ready to play for this bloke.” What of Farrell junior’s
  England future? In the second Test, in Melbourne, Owen won his first
  international cap since the 2023 World Cup and having returned to join Earl at
  Saracens he is eligible to play for England again. “I love playing with him,
  every time I take the pitch with Owen, I think ‘we’re going to win’,” says
  Earl. “That’s his best quality. “It’s not up to me [if he plays for England
  again]. There are too many moving parts for me to comment on that. The more
  times I can take the field with that bloke, the better, let me put it that
  way.” Meanwhile, Dan Sheehan has been suspended for four matches following his
  illegal clearout of Australia’s Tom Lynagh during Saturday’s third Test. The
  sanction will be reduced to three games, subject to the Ireland and Leinster
  player successfully completing a coaching intervention course. Sheehan’s
  challenge in the first half of the Lions’ 22-12 loss went unpunished by
  Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli before he was retrospectively cited. Replays
  showed the 26-year-old’s elbow appeared to make contact with his opponent’s
  head. Sheehan will be unavailable for Leinster’s pre-season clash with Cardiff
  on 13 September and United Rugby Championship (URC) fixtures against South
  African sides the Stormers and the Sharks on 26 September and 11 October
  respectively. If he serves the full four-match ban, the forward will also sit
  out his province’s URC clash with rivals Munster on 18 October.
