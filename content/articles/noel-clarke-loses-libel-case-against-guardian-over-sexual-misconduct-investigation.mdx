  The Guardian has successfully defended a libel action brought by Noel Clarke
  over an investigation in which the actor was accused of sexual misconduct by
  more than 20 women. In a landmark high court judgment handed down on Friday,
  Mrs Justice Steyn rejected Clarke’s claims, and ruled the newspaper had
  succeeded in both its defences: of truth and public interest. Clarke had
  claimed the allegations in the Guardian’s investigation were false and that he
  had been the victim of an unlawful conspiracy. In her ruling, Steyn said she
  accepted some of Clarke’s evidence, “but overall I find that he was not a
  credible or reliable witness”. His “general pattern” was “of only being
  prepared to admit that which was established by documentary evidence (which he
  had carefully studied), and even then only to the minimum extent shown”. She
  said there had been no conspiracy to lie, and the conspiracy claim did not
  have a “proper foundation”. Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the
  Guardian, said of the outcome: “The judge ruled, in extremely clear language,
  that the Guardian’s reporting was substantially true, and our belief that the
  reporting was in the public interest was undoubtedly reasonable. “This
  judgment is a deserved victory for those women who suffered because of the
  behaviour of Noel Clarke. Going to court is difficult and stressful, yet more
  than 20 women agreed to testify in the high court, refusing to be bullied or
  intimidated. “This is also a landmark judgment for Guardian journalism, and
  for investigative journalism in Britain. It was important to fight this case.
  This was a deeply researched investigation by some of the Guardian’s best
  reporters, who worked diligently and responsibly. The judgment is clear that
  our investigation was thorough and fair, a template for public interest
  journalism. “I hope today will give encouragement to other women in similar
  situations who have been too fearful to raise their voices for fear of the
  consequences.” In her judgment, Steyn said: “There has been much reference to
  an ‘anonymous email campaign’ making false allegations against Mr Clarke. If
  there was such a ‘campaign’ – and it seems Bafta may have received some
  vitriolic anonymous emails – it was not something to which any of the
  witnesses were party.” While one or two of them wrote anonymously to Bafta,
  “the matters they raised were true”. She said Clarke’s case that there was an
  unlawful conspiracy “was born of necessity, in the face of the large body of
  witnesses giving evidence against him”. “There has been no conspiracy to lie.
  In the absence of a conspiracy, Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses –
  none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come
  to court to lie is inherently implausible.” Clarke, 49, had said he would seek
  £70m in damages if successful. The Guardian relied on testimony from almost 30
  people, 26 of whom spoke in court in London about their experiences of working
  with the former star of Doctor Who. Many said they had been directly affected
  by Clarke, while others said they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour. The
  writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy sued Guardian News &amp; Media
  (GNM) over seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March
  2022 in which more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct. The judge
  found that Viner, along with other Guardian editors and reporters, believed
  publication was in the public interest, which was a reasonable belief. The
  allegations against Clarke were made up of the following elements: There were
  strong grounds to believe that, over 15 years, he had used his power to prey
  on and harass female colleagues. He sometimes bullied female colleagues. He
  engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping. He engaged
  in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments. He was involved in
  professional misconduct. He took and shared explicit pictures and videos
  without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.
  The judge found that “instances of each of those elements have been
  established”. In closing submissions, Gavin Millar KC, for the Guardian, said
  Clarke had been forced to come up with an “elaborate conspiracy theory” to try
  to rebut the “overwhelming evidence” against him. Clarke denied all the
  allegations and variously claimed that his accusers were lying, embellishing
  incidents, motivated by grudges and that there was a conspiracy against him.
  Steyn said: “While Mr Clarke was willing to desist from making sexual
  allusions and advances and engaging in sexual talk with those who
  unequivocally spurned him, he clearly felt the onus was on such a person to
  object to his behaviour and he regarded anyone who was unwilling to acquiesce
  in his ‘sexual banter’ as haughty and hostile.” She said she accepted one
  aspect of Clarke’s evidence, namely “his belief that he is not what the
  Guardian ‘branded’ him”. “Although I find that he has been untruthful about
  most of the allegations in his efforts to salvage his career, his initial
  response that ‘some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not
  intend or realise’ was true. “Even when his actions have been calculated and
  deliberate, Mr Clarke has tended to be oblivious to their impact, regarding
  his own behaviour as merely being ‘naughty’, ‘cheeky’, ‘teasing’ or within his
  rights as a director or producer. “In addition, he does not see himself as
  reflected in the articles because there is a kinder, more generous side to
  him. But that does not detract from the conclusions I have reached.” She found
  that in one sex scene involving Clarke, an actor known as “Penelope” was naked
  from the waist down, and this was “not necessary” for the purposes of the
  footage taken. She said: “I have not found that the requirement for ‘Penelope’
  to be naked below the waist for the filming of the sex scene was introduced
  for Mr Clarke’s sexual gratification, but he did then take advantage of it for
  that purpose.” Discussing another witness, she said: “The strong impression
  that I gained is that Mr Clarke felt that he could sexually proposition any
  woman he wanted, as reflected in his evidence that he has ‘been turned down a
  million times’, even allowing for the obvious hyperbole – regardless of the
  circumstances. “He had no understanding of how pressuring such conduct could
  be, or how uncomfortable it could make young women, in subordinate roles to
  him, feel while performing their jobs.” Of the Guardian’s reporting, the judge
  said the claim that journalists covering the investigation became a party to a
  conspiracy and knowingly deceived Viner and others to secure publication of
  known falsehoods was “wholly unfounded and meritless”. “It is readily apparent
  that none of the reporters and editors involved had any interest in publishing
  any allegation that they did not believe to be true, or sufficiently verified
  and corroborated to be fit and ready for publication.” Of individual
  witnesses’ accounts, Steyn said the Guardian had established that Clarke
  “revealed naked photographs” of a woman known as “Ivy” without her consent and
  shared them. Gina Powell, who worked at Clarke’s Unstoppable Film and TV
  production company between 2014 and 2017, alleges the actor groped her in a
  lift, exposed himself to her in a car, and brushed off concerns about his
  sexual behaviour towards other women. She also told the court that he kept a
  hard drive of naked pictures of others. The judge described Powell as “an
  impressive and compelling witness” who “demonstrated admirable bravery and
  integrity”. Steyn said she had “no hesitation in finding that she was an
  honest, reliable witness, who did not overstate or exaggerate any of the
  matters which she addressed”. Joanne Hayes, who in 2004 worked with Clarke on
  Doctor Who as a costume assistant, claims that, while alone with her in his
  trailer on set, Clarke told her he liked girls with long hair, adding words to
  the effect that it was “nice to have something to hold on to when I do them
  from behind”. Steyn said Hayes “gave truthful, careful and reliable evidence”
  and had “no reason to come forward and lie”. In a statement, Clarke said:
  “Today’s result is disappointing. For almost five years, I have fought against
  a powerful media outlet and its extensive legal teams over inaccurate and
  damaging reporting. “These stories started via anonymous emails portraying me
  as a monster to attract attention and outrage. The goal was to damage my
  career, and they succeeded. “I have never claimed to be perfect. But I am not
  the person described in these articles. Overnight I lost everything. The media
  outlet didn’t just ruin my life; they ripped through my family’s also.” Clarke
  thanked the “team who stood beside me throughout”, including his family, “who
  never stopped believing there was something worth fighting for”. At the
  conclusion of the trial, Philip Williams, representing Clarke, argued that his
  client was the victim of an industry attempting a “purge” after the #MeToo
  movement. He highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series and Carry On
  films as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate”, and said
  the treatment of Clarke “represents illiterate historical revisionism and
  completely ignores any nuance or context”. Millar, for the Guardian, said
  Clarke had “made unpersuasive but revealing efforts to normalise and/or excuse
  conduct that most people would find – and would have found, whether 10 or 20
  years ago – offensive and unacceptable”. Steyn’s judgment means Clarke, who
  said his career had collapsed as a result of the articles, faces a hefty legal
  bill and may also be required to pay the bulk of the Guardian’s legal costs.
  The trial was a rare case of #MeToo-type allegations published by a UK
  newspaper going to trial. A victory for Clarke would have been likely to make
  the press rethink future reporting on such issues. After the publication of
  the Guardian’s first report on Clarke, Bafta suspended a lifetime achievement
  award it had given him the previous week and ITV declined to broadcast the
  final episode of the thriller Viewpoint, in which he was starring.
  Additionally, Sky cancelled the award-winning police show Bulletproof, which
  was created by and starred Clarke. He also left Unstoppable Film and TV, the
  company he co-founded and which produced Bulletproof.
