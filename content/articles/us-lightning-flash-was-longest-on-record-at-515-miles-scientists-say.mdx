  A 515-mile (829km) lightning flash has set a new record as the longest ever
  identified. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed the new
  world record for the flash registered on 22 October 2017 over the Great Plains
  in the US. It stretched from east Texas to near Kansas City, Missouri, roughly
  the distance between Paris and Venice. The previous record of 768km was also
  recorded in the Great Plains, a hotspot for severe thunderstorms, on 29 April
  2020. Since 2016, scientific advances in space-based mapping have allowed for
  lightning flashes to be measured over a broader space, allowing these long
  flashes to be recorded. This event was one of the first flashes to be
  documented using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s latest
  model of orbital satellite, known as a geostationary operational environmental
  satellite. Michael J Peterson, the lead author and an evaluation committee
  member of the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Institute of
  Technology, said: “The extremes of what lightning is capable of is difficult
  to study because it pushes the boundaries of what we can practically observe.
  Adding continuous measurements from geostationary orbit was a major advance.”
  Before using orbital satellites to record the duration and length of lightning
  flashes, data was collected by ground-based sensors. Many scientists
  acknowledged that there were limits to the duration and length of lightning
  they could record with these ground sensors. The advances in technology have
  also allowed for the recording of the greatest duration for a single lightning
  flash. The record is a flash that lasted 17.1 seconds during a thunderstorm
  over Uruguay and northern Argentina on 18 June 2020. Prof Randall Cerveny, a
  rapporteur of weather and climate extremes at the WMO, said: “[The] everyday
  implications of these events are that lightning can travel quite long
  distances away from the parent thunderstorm. Because of this fact, people need
  to limit their outdoor activities during lightning-producing thunderstorms.”
  The WMO recommends that people caught in a lightning storm take shelter in
  substantial buildings with wiring and plumbing, or a fully enclosed
  metal-topped vehicle.
