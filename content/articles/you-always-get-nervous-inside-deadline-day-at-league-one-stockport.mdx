  “Can my dog live in the apartment?” Ben Osborn asks Stockport’s first-team
  scouting operations manager, Dale Hargan. The Derby midfielder is about to
  undergo a medical before joining the League One side on a season-long loan and
  there are questions that need to be answered. It is deadline day and Osborn
  has left his East Midlands home for the prospect of more regular playing time.
  He will be one of three arrivals at Edgeley Park before the window closes, the
  end of half a year of planning for Stockport. It looks like everything has
  gone smoothly when Osborn eventually signs the relevant paperwork at 6pm in
  the boardroom at the club’s training ground clad in official merchandise.
  Relief can be seen on the faces of the recruitment team. Their hard work has
  paid off. Walking through the training ground door at 10am, the message is
  loud and clear: “It is manic already.” Everton’s Tyler Onyango and Rochdale’s
  Corey Edwards have joined on loan. The announcements will come later, but
  unknowns are the enemy. Stockport have a plan but a bid for one of their key
  assets will change the course of the day without notice. In the de facto
  transfer boiler room, located on the first floor, phones do not stop pinging.
  The head of recruitment, Jonathan Smith, is filtering names from agents and
  clubs. “It wouldn’t be unusual to have about 150 players offered in a day,”
  says Smith. “Has he got a British passport?” Smith asks one caller. “I like
  him but we don’t need someone in that position,” is another response as he
  runs through candidates. Stockport’s chief executive, Simon Wilson, who was
  previously the club’s director of football, steps in for updates. There is no
  fax machine but the coffee machine keeps whirring to power the day, which
  mercifully finishes four hours earlier than in previous years. Meanwhile, the
  head of emerging talent, Vinil Joseph, sits in the corner trawling through
  TransferRoom, a marketplace for players. Clubs list the positions they are
  looking for and how much they are willing to pay. Behind Joseph is a list of
  every League One and Two club, detailing business they might want to do. “He
  could be too lightweight for League One,” someone says. The brief moments of
  peace are spent analysing the latest deals announced on Sky Sports News. This
  is the swan kicking its legs. Osborn is the focus, a central midfielder who
  can also operate as a left-wing back, solving two problems in one. A deadline
  of 10am is given to Derby to accept Stockport’s offer to cover a certain
  percentage of his wages. The WhatsApp message arrives 20 minutes later and the
  wheels are in motion, literally as Osborn drives almost two hours to the
  Manchester Institute of Health and Performance [MIHP]. Hargan is dispatched to
  join him, putting on his player liaison hat. Normally three to six months of
  research and planning goes into each signing Stockport make, but Osborn was a
  curveball that piqued interest. He was not on the club’s radar but they were
  made aware that he would fall into budget and was open to dropping down a
  division. These opportunities do not come along often and after doing their
  due diligence by reviewing the data that showed Osborn relentless running
  would fit well into manager Dave Challinor’s style, he was put at the top of
  the list. Other deals were more straightforward, but this was the one everyone
  wanted. The state-of-the-art MIHP facility in east Manchester attracts clubs
  from across the north looking for somewhere to carry out medicals. Seven set
  up camp there on deadline day, including Salford City and Manchester City.
  Stockport made their booking a few days in advance in anticipation of the
  rush. And they needed to given the site is alive with activity as the deadline
  approaches. Stockport’s head of medical, Jake Austin, and an independent
  doctor oversee the early stages of Osborn’s medical, Derby having sent over
  the 31-year-old’s records and with Austin having held conversations with his
  equivalent there. Osborn is asked for his family medical history before going
  through his injuries season-by-season. He knows his body better than anyone
  but Stockport cannot take chances and will focus their testing in the limited
  time available. Modern medicals can take up to six hours but that is not
  practical with the clock ticking. Back at the club’s Carrington base, the
  logistics of plans B, C and D are debated if anything untoward is found in
  Osborn’s medical. An offer is placed for a Premier League youngster and kept
  on the back-burner in case things change dramatically, while a player in the
  Championship is also sounded out. Stockport are known for their smart and
  methodical recruitment, instigated by Wilson, and want to improve on last
  season’s third-place finish. This summer they sold Isaac Olaofe to Charlton
  for 10 times what they paid for the striker two years ago, and have replaced
  him with Malik Mothersille from Peterborough, anticipating their new signing
  has a high ceiling and potentially a greater fee at the end of it. Smith is
  proud of the presentation that helped lure Stoke’s Nathan Lowe, a player
  wanted by almost every League One club, and Finland international Arttu
  Hoskonen, among others. Stockport have plenty of selling points, from their
  modern training ground to the stability of having had the same manager for
  almost four years, pitching themselves as English football’s most ambitious
  project outside the top two divisions. Osborn is impressed by the players’
  room and is given a serviced apartment – one his dog can call home – in
  central Manchester for the length of his loan. Stockport had the answers
  before the questions were asked, therefore making a potentially tricky process
  altogether smooth. “It’s that human side, putting yourself in their shoes,”
  says Smith. “It’s a big change moving to a football club. It’s all those bits
  around it that I’d like to think we do really well.” At 2pm, Challinor joins
  Wilson, Smith and head of football operations, Alex Cowdy, in a meeting to run
  through how deals are progressing as well as debate other available options. A
  defender of interest earlier in the window is now available for nothing having
  previously been quoted at £750,000. Although tempting, the move is ruled out.
  “Calm heads are absolutely needed, because you’ve had some big decisions to
  make,” says Smith. “Preparation is integral; aligning everybody from the
  manager, director of football, chief executive … making sure we’re ready to go
  should something not go as well as what we wanted to happen.” Three players
  depart: Danny Andrew at the end of a one-month contract, while Jid Okeke and
  Jay Mingi head to League Two Walsall and Crewe respectively. Conversations
  take place regarding the exit of other fringe players but no concrete interest
  is shown in them, allowing the collective focus to squarely be put on Osborn.
  Stockport’s captain, Ollie Norwood, was at Sheffield United with Osborn for
  five seasons and the former teammates spoke on the phone for 40 minutes, with
  the former selling the club to the latter. Osborn had numerous offers,
  including from clubs in the Championship, but the words of Norwood and
  Challinor, who also spoke to the player on Sunday, were enough to convince him
  to make what is the first loan move of his career. Challinor comes down to
  meet Osborn for the first time and the manager’s smile shows how happy he is
  to be getting his man. Meanwhile, Wilson and Austin have a lengthy
  conversation to run through the results of the medical and where further to
  examine Osborn. Training kit is found and the sports scientists get to work on
  him. Osborn is forced to test his hamstrings and quads under supervision. “You
  always get nervous,” Smith says of medicals. “It’s part of the process.”
  Osborn’s tests are done and, soon, head of performance, Sam Holt, is heading
  up to club offices to gives the thumbs up to Wilson, Smith and Challinor.
  Plans B to G are disregarded at 5.30pm and Osborn comes in to meet everyone in
  a surprisingly calm manner given the whirlwind day he has endured. He woke a
  Derby resident but will go to bed in Manchester, calling Edgeley Park his
  second home despite having never been to the ground before. Osborn and his
  agent, James Tunnicliffe, wander off to run through the necessary paperwork
  and ensure everything is above board. Cowdy is beckoned into the boardroom for
  the signing of the deal and everything is done by 6pm, with an hour to spare.
  Osborn is then told which group chats to join and Instagram accounts to
  follow. Hands are shaken and everyone is pleased with the outcome. Stockport
  have a player with Premier League experienceand he has the chance to play. On
  days like this it can feel like transfer activity takes place in the space of
  24 hours but the truth is it takes months of work to put deals together.
  “We’ve already peeked into January,” reveals Smith. “We know when contracts
  are expiring. We have some targets that we like that we couldn’t get done this
  summer but perhaps as we move towards January, we can keep an eye on new
  players. We’ll always track new ones, too. It’s not like we’ll close the book
  on everything else.” The media department has been waiting in the wings,
  plotting how to unveil Osborn. Contact with previous clubs has been made to
  source footage and they debate what music would suit the reveal video. Norwood
  has provided the voiceover to explain what Stockport are getting and there are
  promotional photos with Osborn in the home, away and third shirts with “18
  FIORINI” on the back because they are the right size, an indication that not
  all eventualities can be planned for at short notice. Nonetheless, it has been
  a relatively calm and well-ordered transfer window for Stockport. And while it
  may now have closed, the swan keeps kicking.
