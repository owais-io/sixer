  Attacks on prison officers and the number of inmate deaths in England and
  Wales have soared to record levels, according to official figures. Ministry of
  Justice statistics released on Thursday show there were 10,568 assaults on
  staff in jails in the 12 months to March 2025 – up 7% on the previous year.
  The number of people dying in prison rose by nearly a third after 401 deaths
  in the 12 months to the end of June 2025. They included 86 prisoners who died
  in circumstances recorded as “self-inflicted”. An unprecedented seven
  homicides were recorded over the same period. There is deepening concern about
  the crisis in the Prison Service caused by overcrowding, inexperienced staff,
  gang activity and escalating violence. In April, three prison officers were
  attacked by Hashem Abedi, one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena
  bombing, and in May an officer was allegedly attacked by the Southport triple
  murderer Axel Rudakubana. Over the 12 months to the end of March 2025, prisons
  recorded 30,846 assaults, a 9% rise on the previous 12 months. The figures
  show that the rate of staff assaults per 1,000 prisoners increased by 7%,
  while the rate of serious assaults increased by 6%. Prisons reported a record
  high of 77,898 incidents of self-harm in the 12 months to the end of March, a
  rate of one every seven minutes. The rate of self-harm rose by 5% in men’s
  prisons and by 6% in women’s prisons. Annual performance ratings of prisons
  for 2024-25 reveal that 22 prisons – nearly 19% – were deemed to raise serious
  concern, the highest number with this rating since the system was introduced.
  The figures also show that 6,231 prisoners were let out under the justice
  secretary, Shabana Mahmood’s early release scheme between September and
  December. Of those, more than 200 offenders had been jailed for 14 years or
  more. Andrew Neilson, the director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal
  Reform, urged the government to intervene to save lives. “Prisons cannot go on
  like this. It is unconscionable to see the huge rise in deaths in custody, as
  well as continued spikes in self-harm and in assaults,” he said. The
  government has announced plans to use artificial intelligence to predict and
  prevent violence by offenders. AI will be deployed to more accurately assess
  the risk that criminals pose so they could be transferred to high-security
  jails, segregated or placed in special separation units. AI will also be used
  to uncover prisoners’ secret communications by scanning the data in
  confiscated phones for codewords and signals for drug dealing, drone drops and
  threats of violence. The measures are part of an “action plan” by ministers to
  embed AI in the criminal justice system, from AI assistants for all civil
  servants to process information and write reports, to judges seeking to distil
  evidence and compose decisions. Ministers last week announced that staff in
  male prisons in England and Wales would be issued with Tasers as part of a
  trial to clamp down on violence. Figures show that more than £20m has been
  paid out in damages over five years to staff and prisoners who have been
  assaulted. Ministers say they will look at whether the electric stun guns
  should be more widely used after the trial this summer. Mahmood was urged to
  intervene in another jail on Thursday after inspectors said there was a
  “serious risk of harm to children” at Oakhill secure training centre. A joint
  inspection by Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission and HMI Prisons uncovered
  “profound and systemic failures, with safeguarding systems in disarray” at the
  jail in Milton Keynes, which can hold up to 80 children and young people aged
  between 12 and 19. Inspectors found a “fractured leadership team”, with the
  centre director and one of two deputy directors suspended from their duties
  and the other deputy recently sacked. An Ofsted statement said 23 staff were
  suspended between November 2024 and 13 July 2025, including 16 “in response to
  allegations about their conduct with children”. Since 14 July 2025, another
  seven staff members have been suspended. Failures included not meeting
  children’s known mental health needs in a timely manner, children with
  significant injuries where it was unclear whether they had received
  appropriate treatment, and failing governance systems. Mahmood has 28 days to
  respond with an action plan for improvement at the centre. A Ministry of
  Justice spokesperson said: “The government has made it clear it will do
  whatever we can to protect our hardworking staff – which is why we are
  trialling Tasers in prisons and mandated protective body armour. “We’re also
  reforming our jails so they create better citizens, not better criminals.”
