  Leicester City Women have sacked their manager Amandine Miquel a week and a
  half before the Women’s Super League begins, the Guardian understands. The
  Frenchwoman had been in charge for one season after being appointed in July
  2024 and oversaw a 10th-placed finish last term, steering Leicester safely
  clear of relegation. The 41-year-old previously spent seven years in charge of
  the French club Reims and signed a three-year contract with Leicester. The
  Leicester squad were informed of the news on Wednesday evening, according to
  multiple sources. Leicester will begin their WSL campaign with a trip to
  Manchester United on 7 September. Miquel oversaw victories in five of her 22
  WSL matches, drawing a further five games, and delivered a two-point increase
  on Leicester’s 18-point tally from the previous campaign, securing their
  joint-highest finish. The news comes 41 days after Leicester appointed a new
  director of women’s and girls’ football, Lee Billiard. Billiard previously
  spent four years in a similar role at Aston Villa. Leicester will be seeking
  their fifth permanent manager since December 2021 after Jonathan Morgan, Lydia
  Bedford, Willie Kirk and Miquel. It is the WSL’s fourth managerial change of
  the summer, after Tottenham appointed Martin Ho to replace Robert Vilahamn,
  Manchester City appointed Andrée Jeglertz to replace Gareth Taylor and
  Liverpool appointed Taylor. Half of the WSL clubs have changed their manager
  during the past 12 months, with Arsenal and Aston Villa also making changes.
