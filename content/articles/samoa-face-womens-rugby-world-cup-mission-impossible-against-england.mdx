  Samoa have described Saturday’s Rugby World Cup match against England, the
  hosts and favourites, as “mission impossible”; it would rank as one of the
  biggest ever upsets should they somehow manage to beat the Red Roses. Samoa
  are 14 places below England in the world rankings and, while the Red Roses
  have been fully professional for more than five years, Samoa are yet to
  introduce full-time contracts. In their opening matches of this tournament
  England beat the USA 69-7, while Samoa lost 73-0 to Australia. The different
  situation the teams find themselves in is something the England players are
  aware of and the back-row Abi Burton, who will make her World Cup debut, hopes
  this tournament will boost opportunities for every nation. “They are
  inspirational women,” she said of Samoa. “I think the different types of women
  who have come to this World Cup is unbelievable but they all come because they
  love rugby. “That is one thing we all share. It’s really special for them to
  be able to share their story and it does make you reflect on what we have and
  how much rugby has grown in this country. How we have the opportunities we do.
  “Hopefully this World Cup will give everybody more opportunities in their
  nations. Hopefully it will go up a level here, up a level in Spain, up a level
  in Samoa. That is what we want to do. We want to make it go up another level
  for everybody.” The Red Roses have not gone with a full-strength team in
  Northampton, making 13 changes from their opener. This was always the plan;
  the head coach, John Mitchell, communicates his team news to players as early
  as possible and the thinking is to give everyone game time early in the
  tournament. The squad will have achieved that bar one player, Holly Aitchison,
  who has been injured and will hope to make an appearance against Australia
  next Saturday. No matter who is on the team sheet, England have been
  formidable in their 28-game winning streak but the attack coach Lou Meadows
  says there is still more to come. “I would hope to think there are always
  things you haven’t seen because we are constantly trying to improve and test
  our game, tactically switch up as much as possible,” Meadows said, before
  singling out the fly-half Helena Rowland. “It’s special to work with someone
  like Helena and the rest of the back line are electric, as well as our very
  mobile forwards. We’ve got an opportunity here to really play the picture in
  front of us. “We have not really seen a lot of what Samoa can do because WXV
  [the tournament held outside World Cup years] footage doesn’t reveal too much.
  They have worked really hard on their game and we are really excited for the
  opportunity they have got in this tournament. I think it is going to be an
  opportunity again for us to test another side to our game to prove we can
  physically dominate still against a side like Samoa but equally how we can
  adapt to the pictures in front of us.” The two nations have played each other
  only twice before, with England winning on both occasions: 53-0 in 2005 and
  65-3 in 2014. Marlie Packer and Natasha Hunt are the only two players in
  England’s matchday 23 to have played Samoa, in the victory at the 2014 World
  Cup. None of the Samoa players have faced the Red Roses. Mitchell said for
  nations such as Samoa it is less about what the scoreline says and more about
  the performance and pride of playing for their country on a World Cup stage.
  Nothing epitomised that more than the viral video of Samoa’s Fa’asua Makisi
  after the team’s loss against Australia. Makisi’s mother, Petra, flew from New
  Zealand to surprise Makisi, getting off the plane at 8am and travelling
  straight to the Pool A match in Manchester. The player’s reaction was complete
  shock and she burst into tears when she spotted her mum post-match. “She was
  holding up a flag behind her and I screamed,” Makisi said. “It was a natural
  response. I couldn’t believe she was here in England and I fully had an
  emotional breakdown in front of the crowd. “My mum has been my rock and she’s
  been one of the main reasons I’ve been able to come here and to see her here
  was really overwhelming, but happy tears for sure! Being the type of supporter
  my mum is, she will be here for all of our pool games and until we go home.”
  Samoa also believe this tournament is an opportunity for the players to be
  offered a chance to play for Premiership Women’s Rugby teams. Bella Milo, the
  Samoa defence coach, said: “I think for them to be able to gain experience
  overseas would be awesome. In order for us to play at that level, being able
  to play against players from here and also being able to be looked after in
  terms of a PWR contract and the facilities they have, I think our players
  would be able to continue to grow and hopefully bring those opportunities back
  to Samoa.” England are expected to win but the margin will become the focus as
  the game goes on. The record score at a women’s Rugby World Cup is the Black
  Ferns’ 134-6 victory over Germany in 1998. It is one record that the
  competition will not want to see broken on Saturday.
