  ‘He can pull something out of the bag’: Aston Villa look to Guessand for
  cutting edge

  The overwhelming takeaway from Aston Villa’s opening game of the season, a
  goalless draw at home to Newcastle, was that Unai Emery’s side were strangely
  stale, lacking in sharp edges and devoid of a spark. Villa’s xG – for what it
  is worth – was only 0.13. Enter Evann Guessand? Guessand had a watching brief
  at Villa Park as his new teammates struggled to penetrate the opposition but
  presumably Emery is tempted to introduce his £30m signing from Nice, a
  powerful forward with a penchant for eliminating defenders and tearing down
  the flanks, in search of victory at Brentford this weekend. For Guessand there
  are new surrounds, and these remain early days, but the 24-year-old is coming
  in hot, fresh from a breakout season at Nice where he scored 13 goals in 40
  matches (33 of which were starts) and was voted their joint-player of the
  season after helping the team to fourth in Ligue 1, their highest finish since
  2016-17. Guessand’s final goal for Nice came in a 6-0 home win against Brest.
  The visitors’ goalkeeper that day? Marco Bizot, the 34-year-old Dutchman who
  is Villa’s only other arrival this summer. Guessand predominantly featured on
  the right wing for Nice but also operated off the left, as a No 9 and behind
  the striker. “He is capable of pulling something out of the bag to make the
  difference,” says Lilian Nalis, the Nice assistant manager. “If he gets in
  front of you, it’s difficult for defenders to get him back.” Last season was
  his first as a regular starter for Nice, for whom he starred domestically and
  in the Europa League after loans to Lausanne and Nantes. For Nalis, Guessand’s
  equaliser at Nantes, where he seized the ball in the box, took the briefest of
  glances at goal and sent a fizzing left-foot shot into the top corner, stands
  out. “He’s at his best on the wings because there he can take on people,
  dribble and accelerate beyond defenders with his speed,” says Nalis, the
  former Leicester and Plymouth midfielder who spent six years in England.
  “Evann, with his goals and assists, had a big part in taking us towards the
  top.” Guessand was born in Ajaccio, the capital of Corsica, where his father,
  Hervé, also a striker, played, and joined Nice aged 12 after being spotted at
  ASPTT Marseille, a multi-sport youth club. From that point Guessand always
  felt a fondness for Nice, where he was a boarder at the College du Parc
  Imperial secondary school, mixing with youngsters aged between 11 and 20,
  200km from his family home in Marseille. Nice’s then academy director, Alain
  Wathelet, wanted to gauge Guessand’s talent so asked him to join an Under-14s
  session, in which he impressed with his dribbling skills and eye for goal.
  “Within five minutes, we approved him,” says Nice’s pre-academy coach, Pascal
  Bistarelli, for whom an Under-15s title-deciding match sticks in the memory.
  “It was 2-2 at half-time and I asked him to increase his level. It finished
  6-2, Evann scored a hat-trick.” Guessand’s education in Nice fuelled his drive
  to succeed. He was a ballboy and flag bearer at Nice matches and soon grasped
  the lyrics of Nissa la Bella, Menica Rondelly’s hymn synonymous with the city.
  “Evann always showed great attachment to Nice, even when he went on loan to
  Lausanne and Nantes,” says Bistarelli. “He was always determined to play in
  the Nice first team.” Guessand, who was given his debut against Fréjus
  Saint-Raphaël in the Coupe de France by Patrick Vieira in 2020, playing as a
  left winger, has stayed in touch with Bistarelli; the pair exchanged messages
  when he signed for Villa and Guessand gave him his shirt for Bistarelli’s
  birthday. Guessand represented France at youth level but made his Ivory Coast
  debut last year. He grew up idolising Didier Drogba and the pair had dinner in
  Abidjan a few years ago and have remained in contact. But while Guessand has
  drawn comparisons to Drogba, unlike the former Chelsea player he is not a
  conventional No 9. “If you talk about the power he’s got, I would say yes,
  they are similar, but they’re not the same kind of player,” says Nalis.
  “Drogba enjoyed the battle of playing when he had his back to goal, a defender
  on his back. Evann doesn’t like that so much – he prefers almost hugging the
  touchline so he can see all the information he needs before making his move.”
  Villa tracked Guessand, who rejected a move to the Saudi Pro League side Neom
  earlier this summer, for 12 months before his arrival. They moved to sign him,
  amid strong interest from Crystal Palace, before the £39m sale of Jacob Ramsey
  to Newcastle and Leon Bailey’s expected exit to Roma to prevent the
  possibility of being quoted an inflated price for a player who had three years
  remaining on his Nice contract. Villa acknowledge Guessand’s game requires
  some refinement but they see shades of Morgan Rogers in a player who is also
  adept at retaining the ball under pressure. Emery admires his versatility,
  citing his ability to play across the frontline, including as a No 10. “We are
  watching him, giving him a lot of information about how we want to build the
  team,” says Villa’s manager. “He is watching our analysis, our matches. I am
  using him as a striker and winger [in training]. Finding how to best put him
  into our structure is my job. He is going to help us a lot, hopefully.” Now
  Guessand, voted the second-best African player in Ligue 1 last season, behind
  Paris Saint-Germain’s Achraf Hakimi, plans to build on his promise in the
  Premier League. “England is a step up,” says Nalis. “You get no time to rest;
  English football will kick your ass if you think you’re going to take your
  time or if you think you’re going to ait until you’re capable of playing at
  your high level. You need to perform. “English football is probably more
  physical than French but I’ve seen him have some good games against tough
  guys. I’m looking forward to him showing his skills in England.”
