  A new civil service internship scheme will be open only to working-class
  students as part of a drive to make Whitehall better reflect the country, the
  government has said. The programme will give students from lower-income
  backgrounds the chance to apply for paid government placements. The definition
  of working class will be based on what jobs were held by their parents when
  the applicant was 14 and replaces an existing programme open to all. The
  Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, said the action was being taken because
  applicants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were less likely to get a
  place on the so-called fast stream. “We need to get more working-class young
  people into the civil service so it harnesses the broadest range of talent and
  truly reflects the country,” he said. “Government makes better decisions when
  it represents and understands the people we serve. “I want to open up
  opportunities for students from all backgrounds, and in every corner of the
  UK, so they can take a leading role at the heart of government as we rewire
  the state and deliver the plan for change.” The two-month summer programme
  will give 200 undergraduates the opportunity to work in a civil service
  department from next year, with applications starting this October. Their
  placement work could include planning events, writing briefings for ministers,
  shadowing senior civil servants and carrying out research for policy
  development. They will also be allocated a “buddy” who is a current
  fast-streamer and get access to skills sessions. Participants who perform well
  will be fast-tracked to the final stages of the fast-stream selection process
  if they decide to apply for a job after graduation. There is a standard
  government definition of someone’s socioeconomic status based on parental
  occupation, worked out under criteria from the Office for National Statistics.
  The main question is whether the highest earner in the household when a person
  was 14 was: a modern professional such as a teacher or nurse; clerical such as
  a secretary; senior manager; technical worker such as a motor mechanic;
  semi-routine manual such as a postal worker or security guard; routine manual
  such as a van driver or cleaner; junior/middle manager such as a publican or
  retail supervisor; or in a traditional professional occupations such as an
  accountant or solicitor. Other questions involve whether the highest earning
  parent was employed or self-employed, and whether they supervised others.
  People with parents whose occupations were receptionist, electrician, plumber
  or van driver would be likely to qualify as working class. The most recent
  data shows only about one in 10 successful applicants to the fast-stream
  graduate programme come from the lowest income backgrounds. The fast-stream
  programme was suspended briefly in 2023 as a cost-cutting measure but has
  since been reinstated. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union for
  senior civil servants, said the changes to the summer internships to increase
  the number of working class people entering the civil service were welcome but
  the government could also improve progression through civil service grades for
  that demographic. Sarah Atkinson, the chief executive of the Social Mobility
  Foundation, said she was “delighted by the government’s decision to ringfence
  internship opportunities for students from lower-income backgrounds”. “We know
  that talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not, and sometimes bold action
  is needed to create a truly level playing field,” she said. However, the
  Conservatives appeared less happy. Kemi Badenoch said: “Under my leadership, a
  Conservative government would scrap all this rubbish and just hire the best
  people.” Ministers have pledged to cut the size of the civil service, with
  tens of thousands of roles estimated to go over the coming years. New figures
  show it has grown to a 20-year high of almost 550,000 people as of March this
  year, with most manager level or above and the growth attributed to more
  operational frontline roles.
