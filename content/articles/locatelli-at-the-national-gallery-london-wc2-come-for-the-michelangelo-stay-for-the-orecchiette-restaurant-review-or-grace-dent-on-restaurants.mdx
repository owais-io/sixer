  I first heard of Giorgio Locatelli’s move to the Sainsbury Wing of the
  National Gallery on Trafalgar Square in London via a promotional shot in which
  the great man stands, arms crossed, in front of The Supper at Emmaus by
  Caravaggio. In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks
  and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and
  shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for the The
  Entombment by Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette
  with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even
  just for a coffee and a cake at Bar Giorgio, which is really just a coffee
  stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled
  brioche buns for £7 a pop. Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with
  the catering company Searcys, which controls the dining offering at a number
  of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power
  station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall,
  Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish
  experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots. The National Gallery,
  especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed,
  Michelin-starred restaurant Locanda Locatelli, where small portions of pricey
  pasta, drilled service and twinkly lighting created a charming ambience. So
  charming, in fact, that after your linguine all’astice or strozzapreti al
  pomodoro, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over
  by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome. Locatelli’s skill at creating
  ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment,
  when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed
  with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and
  crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be
  anywhere else but staring at The Ambassadors by Holbein the Younger, and are
  probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and
  panzanella antipasti. But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National
  Gallery a lot. Head chef Imma Savinelli and general manager Costanzo Cappella,
  who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in
  this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold
  furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of
  tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a
  big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours, adonises and breakfast
  martinis. What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than
  the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping
  hot fritto misto, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we
  visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick
  pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of
  delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up
  for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal
  tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or
  calamarata with sea bream. Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of
  potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil
  for dipping, which we ate with a bowl of giardiniera (pickled vegetables),
  including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan
  offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with
  a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil
  pesto. From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast
  chicken with polenta, both of them served with potato arrosto, should one see
  fit. The contorni section, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those
  spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the
  dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was
  not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream
  buns. Service throughout felt as if everyone involved cared a great deal about
  your experience and was trying incredibly hard, even if it was the first time
  they’d ever worked in a restaurant, which in the current era of hospitality is
  really about as good as it gets. I’ll take my service pleasant, well-meaning
  and unpolished any day. Overall, then, there’s a lot to love about Locatelli
  at the National Gallery. Sure, it’s not a patch on a night out at Locanda
  Locatelli; it’s just a once-round-the-Botticellis followed by a bowl of fresh
  tagliatelle kind of gig. Not a masterpiece, but not bad. Not bad at all.
