  ABC science broadcaster Robyn Williams has always wanted to excite listeners
  with tales of discovery about the natural world. He has less interest in
  presenting a shopping list of facts and research papers which could quickly
  bore listeners of Radio National’s The Science Show. “Networks and
  relationships are the essence of great science, and great other stuff as
  well,” Williams tells Guardian Australia on the eve of the 50th anniversary of
  the program. “It’s about trying to get listeners to realise that there is not
  only something that changes their world for the better, but that it can be an
  exciting journey of discovery, and sometimes a funny one.” His approach may be
  the key to his remarkable longevity in the role of presenter of The Science
  Show: the longest running program on the ABC with the same host. On Saturday
  30 August 1975, Radio National broadcast the first episode of The Science
  Show, live from the 13th Pacific Science Congress in Vancouver. On Saturday,
  the program celebrates 50 years with a birthday broadcast at midday. Williams
  – the founding presenter of the program – was 31 when it started. He is now
  81. For 25 of those years he has worked with producer David Fisher. The
  program has always been ahead of the game, whether it is reporting on global
  warming or featuring groundbreaking investigations into asbestos and medical
  malpractice. In a 1987 episode of The Science Show, Norman Swan, who went on
  to host The Health Report, exposed scientific research fraud by obstetrician
  Dr William McBride. The late Matt Peacock AM uncovered the corruption and spin
  of the asbestos industry over three decades, Williams said at a celebratory
  event held at the ABC on Wednesday attended by eminent scientists including
  Fiona Stanley and Tim Flannery. On the first episode, author and academic Lord
  Ritchie-Calder warned about the climate effects of releasing gases from fossil
  fuels into the atmosphere after Williams asked him: “Do you expect the
  limitation to this ever-expanding use of fossil fuels as an energy source to
  be due to either running out of them or to this second question of climate
  effect?” The science editor at Radio National, Jonathan Webb, told the crowd
  in Studio 22 for the 50th birthday, he did wonder if the time was right to be
  celebrating “a person who is comparatively old, comparatively white and
  comparatively male”. “I feel I can make these observations because I am also
  male and white, and my knees are giving out,” Webb said. “However, the more
  that I thought and I spoke to Robyn himself, of course, I realised that this
  is a celebration of so, so much more than one man. “It’s a celebration of an
  institution, because that’s what The Science Show is. And at this moment in
  2025, institutions around the world are suffering from neglect and often from
  outright attack.” ABC chair Kim Williams remembers sending Robyn Williams a
  huge bunch of flowers for the program’s 20th. “It has engaged hundreds of
  thousands of listeners weekly, fostering science literacy literally
  nationwide, sparking public debate and awareness,” the chair told the crowd.
  “It has celebrated with national events and awards and established a template
  for radio-based science journalism in Australia. “The Science Show has
  inspired a generation of science journalists, podcasters and educators,
  demonstrating the power of storytelling in demystifying complex research.
  “Importantly it has improved public trust in science by always providing
  balanced, evidence-based reporting.” Williams says he is essentially doing the
  same thing he did 5o years ago, despite the seismic changes to the media
  landscape. “I am still going to campuses and houses, and I’m knocking on the
  door and I’m carrying a microphone,” he says. “It used to be a Nagra recorder
  which weighed five kilos.” He has famously refused to carry a mobile phone and
  communicates via email and landline. (He has been known to carry a block of
  wood which he calls his “mobile phone”.) Up until the Covid pandemic, he wrote
  his weekly script on a typewriter. Webb says Williams would appear on Friday
  mornings before dawn and bang away on the typewriter because he liked the
  rhythm of sitting down and typing. He loathes social media and told the crowd
  as much at the event, even though the science unit has embraced social media
  as a way of getting its content out. However, the quality of those hour-long
  scripts is flawless. “If there’s one thing that stands out, it’s Robyn’s radio
  craft,” Webb says. “His peers love Robyn’s scripting, he is the master of
  efficient scripting that turns on a dime from one topic to another, and he
  really often has a cheeky aside.” The cheeky side was no doubt nurtured by the
  five years he spent in television in the UK where he was an extra on The
  Goodies, Monty Python’s Flying Circus and Doctor Who. After a science degree
  he decided to put the acting and the science together and try journalism,
  getting a job at the ABC in 1971. When we met Williams in an ABC recording
  studio to take photographs, he declared he was wearing a suit jacket he bought
  from David Jones in 1973, while apologising for his muddy trousers and shoes,
  which were soiled at his property on the south coast of New South Wales. But
  some things do change. Colleagues used to rib him about his habit of wearing
  sandals to the office, but he appears to have given that habit up. • The
  Science Show Celebrates 50 Years is on Saturday at noon or on ABC Listen.
