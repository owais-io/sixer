  Solitude Without Loneliness review – bad dates, frenzied flyering and the
  spirit of the fringe

  The dry title belies a show with spark. Solitude Without Loneliness can feel
  like several fringe shows in one as Malcolm Sutherland’s dance-theatre
  production takes an early detour into sketch comedy and then continues to
  change gears. As a choreographer, Sutherland is interested in the perks and
  perils of isolation and he forms a trio with Jorja Follina and Alex Henderson,
  who are all initially alone together. Against the stark towers cast by Simon
  Gane’s lighting design, the three writhe in a state of undress, faces covered
  by their clothing. It’s a straightforward yet surprisingly effective way to
  establish a piece about depersonalisation, matched by muffled voices on Hörður
  Már Bjarnason’s rumbling soundscape and muted costumes by Alison Brown. As the
  dancers leave their silos to come together, their soul-searching gazes matched
  to choral music, you brace yourself for an overearnest hour. But then the
  Blind Date theme tune breaks out, rose petals are scattered and the trio
  alternate the roles of a frisky French waiter and two diners who can’t bear to
  look at each other as they squirm around their seats. The knockabout wordplay
  aims to be as nimble as the movement, but the touches of clowning – including
  red lipstick served and smeared in lieu of wine – are more winning. The
  alternately serio-comic nature of these two episodes – which are both
  overextended – is akin to channel-hopping, and the contrast diminishes the
  impact of each. But the remainder of the show reaps haunting results from
  unlikely sources. The first is a series of speeches akin to Metro’s Rush Hour
  Crush column, each a message in a bottle to a stranger after a brief
  encounter. These missed chances for connection have a sting here, as does a
  meta-theatrical flyering sequence that finds the desperate cast surrounded by
  adverts for their own show. It’s a spin on the scenes along the Grassmarket
  outside, with Sutherland cannily pinning all his themes – romance,
  disorientation, loneliness, togetherness – to the fringe itself. An intriguing
  hour. • At Dance Base, Edinburgh, until 10 August • All our Edinburgh festival
