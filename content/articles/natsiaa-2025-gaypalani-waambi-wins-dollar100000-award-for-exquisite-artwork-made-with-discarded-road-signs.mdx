  Gaypalani Waṉambi grew up surrounded by art, with her family home in
  north-eastern Arnhem Land doubling as a studio where her parents and siblings
  painted on bark and wooden poles. In her late teens, she started assisting her
  father, esteemed artist Mr W Waṉambi, who taught her how to paint the clan’s
  ancient designs, using traditional materials such as ochre. As he branched
  into more experimental forms such as animation and etching on metal, she too
  began to experiment with these new mediums. On Friday night, the Yolŋu woman
  was awarded the $100,000 top prize at the 42nd National Aboriginal and Torres
  Strait Islander art awards (Natsiaas), one of Australia’s richest and most
  prestigious art prizes, for an artwork that honoured his legacy while forging
  her own path. Waṉambi’s work was among seven winners across categories ranging
  from bark painting to multimedia, with six of the awards won by women,
  including senior Pitjantjatjara artist Iluwanti Ken, who won the painting
  award. Each category winner receives $15,000. Gaypalani’s winning work, Burwu,
  blossom, is a shimmering large-scale depiction of one of her clan’s ancient
  songlines, etched on to the back of discarded metal road signs; a powerful
  fusion of ancient stories and knowledge with contemporary technologies and
  materials, and a tribute the cultural inheritance passed down by her father.
  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips
  for the weekend, every Saturday morning Created on a 3 sq metre assemblage of
  15 metal road signs, the artwork’s surface depicts hundreds of stringybark
  blossoms and thousands of bees, referencing the songline of Wuyal, the honey
  hunter – an important ancestor for the Marrakulu clan. Viewing the etched
  illustrations from different angles, they seem to shimmer with movement – like
  the vibrating of tiny wings. The back of the work is a collage of red and
  yellow road signs: “DETOUR” reads one; “ROAD CLOSED AHEAD”, another. In a
  joint statement, the judging panel – Yamatji curator Stephen Gilchrist, Meriam
  artist Gail Mabo, and Bundjalung, Muruwari and Kamilaroi artist and researcher
  Brian Martin – described Burwu, blossom as “an exceptional work that visually
  and materially explores different relationships to and understandings of
  Country”, saying: “Each jewel-like panel shimmers with exquisitely rendered
  designs that are deeply anchored to Yolŋu philosophies.” In Yolŋu culture,
  sacred designs are passed down by knowledge holders to the younger
  generations. For a long time it passed between men, but from the 1970s onwards
  senior men began to teach their daughters. Gaypalani’s father taught her to
  paint the miny’tji for the clan’s saltwater stories, and she assisted him in
  creating the detailed depictions of schools of wawurritjpal (sea-mullets) he
  was renowned for. He also taught her the designs for the freshwater Wuyal
  songline. “I showed these designs to him, to my father – my paintings of the
  honey,” Gaypalani said in a prerecorded statement in Yolŋu Matha. “That is
  when he told me ‘Great! You will take this design now as your own. And you
  will paint this when I am no more.” Mr Waṉambi died unexpectedly in 2022, aged
  59. Writing about the Wuyal songline for the landmark international exhibition
  Madayin, which he co-curated, Mr Waṉambi wrote: “When we see the flowers
  blossoming, we sing dhaŋarra, and it reminds us of all the spirits of the
  people who have gone before us and will bloom again.” Gaypalani’s etchings on
  metal are part of the found-art movement that has blossomed in Yirrkala in
  recent years, spearheaded by artists such as Gunybi Ganambarr. Fuelled by a
  spirit of innovation, these artists started using discarded road signs and
  detritus from mining operations as canvases, etching designs on to their
  surfaces. Gaypalani is the only Yolŋu woman, so far, to make art in this
  medium. A spirit of innovation was present across this year’s finalists, which
  are now all on show at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory
  (MAGNT) in Garramilla/Darwin. “I think the Natsiaas provide a platform for
  people to try something new; to experiment and push their practice a bit
  further,” says Kate ten Buuren, a Taungurung artist and curator who worked
  with Keith Munro, the Museum of Contemporary Art’s director of First Nations
  art and cultures, and Balanggarra artist Karen Mills to select this year’s 71
  finalists from more than 200 entries. The winner of the multimedia category,
  Jahkarli Felicitas Romanis, a Naarm/Melbourne-based photographer of Pitta
  Pitta descent, experimented with Google Earth mapping and visualisation tools
  to create distorted images of Pitta Pitta Country for her winning diptych:
  Pitta Pitta (Extracted) and Pitta Pitta (Google’s Gaze). “Mapping has
  historically been used as a tool of power and control, and it’s a really
  detached way of connecting to place,” Romanis said. “We never connect with
  place in that way. It’s always feet on the ground.” Naomi Hobson, hailing from
  the tiny riverside community of Coen, Cape York, won this year’s work on paper
  award for her photo Present and Beyond, which shows a teenage boy relaxing by
  the river. While it appears carefully staged, Hobson said she took the photo
  moments after seeing him playing with his younger brothers and a wooden boat,
  and he chose the pose himself. It’s a stark contrast to how Hobson’s ancestors
  were photographed. “There’s old photos of my great-grandfather, and what was
  done for him to be in that photo wasn’t comfortable, it wasn’t nice,” she
  said. “And so I wanted to respond to that, and say [to the people I
  photograph]: this is your image. You own it. You take ownership of it.” Her
  Natsiaa win is more than just a personal achievement, she added: “It’s not
  just me. It’s his win. It’s his celebration as well as his family’s … this is
  a celebration for all of us, for all the families, the community, for all the
  young people out there that can look at this image and know that they can
  achieve their goals and dreams and be proud of themselves.” The Natsiaa
  exhibition is on at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory until
  26 January 2026 Dee Jefferson covered the Natsiaas as a guest of NT Tourism
