  More than 750 current and former federal health employees on Wednesday accused
  the health and human services (HHS) secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, of fueling
  harassment and violence directed at government healthcare staff. In a letter
  sent to Kennedy and members of Congress, the group accuses RFK Jr of
  contributing to “the harassment and violence experienced by Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff”, citing decisions such as removing
  members from a CDC vaccine advisory panel, questioning the safety of the
  measles vaccine, and firing key CDC staff as actions that sow distrust in
  federal medical professionals. The group says Kennedy’s rhetoric played a role
  in the 8 August attack at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta, where a Georgia
  man opened fire on four CDC buildings, firing dozens of shots and killing a
  police officer. Law enforcement officials said the gunman blamed a Covid-19
  vaccine for making him feel depressed and suicidal. After the attack, Kennedy
  refused to confirm the motive of the shooter in an interview. He described
  political violence as “wrong” but neither he nor Donald Trump have spoken
  publicly about the motive, despite law enforcement officials making clear the
  shooter targeted the CDC over the vaccine. The health workers are now asking
  Kennedy to “cease and publicly disavow the ongoing dissemination of false and
  misleading claims about vaccines, infectious disease transmission, and
  America’s public health institutions”. The workers further accused Kennedy of
  being “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and
  endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health
  information”. The letter urged the HHS to “acknowledge and affirm that CDC’s
  work is rooted in scientific, non-partisan evidence focused on improving the
  health of every American” and “ensure that the HHS workforce can carry out its
  duties in an environment free from imminent threats of harm”. Additionally, it
  asks Kennedy to take “vigorous action” to eliminate online content that
  targets federal employees, including “DEI watchlists”. The workers asked for a
  response from the health secretary by 2 September. In response to the
  Guardian’s request for comment, the HHS said: “Secretary Kennedy is standing
  firmly with CDC employees – both on the ground and across every center –
  ensuring their safety and wellbeing remain a top priority. In the wake of this
  heartbreaking shooting, he traveled to Atlanta to offer his support and
  reaffirm his deep respect, calling the CDC ‘a shining star among global health
  agencies’.” The statement continues: “For the first time in its 70-year
  history, the mission of HHS is truly resonating with the American people –
  driven by President Trump and Secretary Kennedy’s bold commitment to Make
  America Healthy Again. Any attempt to conflate widely supported public health
  reforms with the violence of a suicidal mass shooter is an attempt to
  politicize a tragedy.” The letter comes a day after the American Academy of
  Pediatrics (AAP) took a stance against the HHS, urging that children as young
  as six months and up to 23 months receive the Covid-19 vaccine, a position
  that diverges from the current federal guidance given by the Trump
  administration’s health agencies. Kennedy responded to the AAP’s updated
  guidelines on social media by accusing the organization of failing to
  sufficiently disclose conflicts of interest.
