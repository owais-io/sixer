  “Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance
  innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are critically
  important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary
  Bettman wrote in his introduction to the NHL’s first – and only, so far –
  diversity and inclusion report, which it released in 2022. “Recognizing these
  facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement
  across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity,
  sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and
  intersections,” Bettman continued. Last week, Bettman was named alongside NHL
  legend Wayne Gretzky, Florida Panthers’ alternate captain Matthew Tkachuk and
  various representatives of other sports as a member of Donald Trump’s sports
  council. The council will be responsible for – among other things – playing an
  “important role in restoring tradition to college athletics, including …
  keeping men out of women’s sports.” Not what you’d call an opportunity for
  Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender
  identity, by the sounds of it. This is not the first time Bettman has given
  mixed messages around social issues. In 2023, for example, the NHL tried to
  host a career fair aimed at recruiting a more diverse workforce (its
  inclusivity report noted that the league’s employees were roughly 84% white
  and 93% straight). The event, attached to that year’s All Star Game in
  Florida, quickly caught the attention of the governor’s office, which accused
  the NHL of discrimination – against white people. The league cancelled the
  career fair. A few weeks later, the NHL again had the opportunity to stand for
  its diversity values when a handful of players refused to wear their team’s
  Pride-themed warmup jerseys. Instead, the NHL retreated meekly, encouraging
  “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues.” That June – Pride
  month, no less – Bettman cancelled the Pride jerseys altogether, calling the
  furor around them “a distraction” from the intended message. One wonders what
  he will call his own foray directly into the culture wars or, for that matter,
  how the NHL may characterize this particular moment of self-expression from
  the commissioner. It’s likely that Bettman’s participation in Trump’s sports
  council will fall into the “voices and perspectives on social and cultural
  issues” category the league talked about during the Pride jerseys fiasco. But
  seeing as Trump seems fixated on getting trans women out of college sports –
  even though there are fewer than 10 transgender athletes in college sports,
  according to the president of the NCAA – this feels like a very specific kind
  of perspective on a cultural issue, doesn’t it? What’s so aggravating about
  repeated allowances for anti-LGBTQ+ perspectives from the NHL under the guise
  of simply letting all opinions flourish equally, is how it pretends that these
  views are all morally equivalent when they’re not. Sure, the players who
  refused to wear a Pride-themed jersey can’t be forced to wear them, but it’s
  not like it was simply a fashion choice. Fundamentally, those players made
  that decision based on a worldview that refuses to accept LGBTQ+ people,
  including their fellow hockey players, as being equal to them and everyone
  else. It’s not the jerseys that were the problem – but they did a great job
  highlighting it. Earlier this spring, Harrison Browne, the first transgender
  player in professional hockey, wrote that while in the NCAA, he was offered
  the option to have his own locker room and change his pronouns on the roster.
  “Looking back, I realize how important it is for trans and non-binary student
  athletes to have those options, whether or not they take them,” Browne wrote
  in The Walrus. “These choices provide a baseline of institutional acceptance
  and acknowledgment for gender-diverse athletes at all levels.” On Monday,
  Browne told the Guardian via email that “to see [Bettman, Gretzky, and
  Tkachuk] get behind an administration that is targeting marginalized
  communities, especially trans people in sports, is deeply disturbing and a
  huge step backwards in making hockey a more inclusive sport.” And going
  backwards really isn’t Bettman’s thing, or it never used to be. When he
  accepted his job as commissioner in 1992, he told a room full of reporters
  that “the way a league performs well is by making its product as attractive as
  it can to the greatest number of fans.” He believed in growth, in other words
  – even up until 2022. What he risks now is stagnation, regression even. On
  that same day in 1992, Bettman said that he wanted to make hockey, a sport
  that at the time was seen as violent and retrograde, more “user-friendly.” And
  he acknowledged that to do it, he’d need to push some of the older owners into
  the future. “It may be that we are going to head in new, progressive
  directions that will make sense to every one immediately,” Bettman said. “For
  some, it may take a little more time.” Maybe the diversity and inclusion stuff
  doesn’t totally make sense to Bettman in 2025 – other North American sports
  have decided that they don’t have the stomach to fight the culture wars under
  Trump either, and NFL commission Roger Goodell is also on the White House
  sports council. But Bettman should give the league’s diversity policies time
  to grow, rather than deliberately reversing course, hurting hockey’s players
  and fans, and ultimately jeopardising the future success of the sport for
  everyone. If that’s too much to ask, at the very least, if he’s invited to
  join a club created by a hostile and retrograde president, he should by now
  have the smarts to just say no.
