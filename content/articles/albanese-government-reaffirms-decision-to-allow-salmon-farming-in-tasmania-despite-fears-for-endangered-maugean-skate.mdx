  despite fears for endangered Maugean skate

  The Albanese government confirmed it will permit salmon farming to continue in
  Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania, despite concerns from conservationists about
  the risks to the endangered Maugean skate. The Bob Brown Foundation and the
  Australia Institute accused the environment minister, Murray Watt, of
  condemning the skate to extinction. The groups were among three organisations
  to receive a letter from Watt on Wednesday notifying them of the widely
  expected decision, which follows the passage of amendments to Australia’s
  nature laws to protect the salmon industry earlier this year. The groups had
  asked the government in 2023 to reconsider a 2012 decision to allow a salmon
  farming expansion in Macquarie Harbour without an assessment under Australia’s
  environmental laws. Watt said all relevant information had been carefully
  considered before reaching his decision. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The
  Albanese Government remains committed to the protection of the Maugean skate,
  including through our funding of oxygenation measures in Macquarie Harbour,”
  he said in a statement. Watt’s decision followed amendments to Australia’s
  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act in March that were designed to
  prevent reconsideration requests in cases in which developments had been
  deemed “not a controlled action” and the minister had specified that the
  development required state or territory oversight. It would apply when the
  development was already under way and had been ongoing or recurring for at
  least five years. The legislation was rushed to parliament before the May
  federal election and was subject to a fiery debate in which the Greens
  environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, waved a dead salmon in the
  Senate after asking if the government had sold out its environmental
  credentials for “rotten, stinking extinction salmon”. The government’s
  decision to introduce the contentious legislation followed lobbying by
  industry and Tasmanian MPs. Anthony Albanese wrote to Tasmania’s three salmon
  companies in February promising that the government would change the law to
  ensure there were “appropriate environmental laws” to “continue sustainable
  salmon farming” in the harbour. The review requested by the environment groups
  was commenced by the former environment minister Tanya Plibersek in 2023. The
  Bob Brown Foundation said Watt had invoked the “controversial and outrageous
  new law” to reach his decision to allow salmon farming to continue without an
  assessment and “has today condemned the Maugean Skate to extinction”. “It is a
  disgrace that a species that was identified by the Albanese government as a
  priority threatened species in 2022, has been purposely abandoned by 2025.”
  “It took our looming court case to force the minister to make a decision after
  more than two years of inaction, deflection and delay,” said Antarctic and
  marine campaigner Alistair Allan. He said the group would be challenging “this
  manifestly wrong decision”. The Australia Institute’s Tasmania director,
  Eloise Carr, said that when Watt became the environment minister, “he said the
  salmon industry needed to lift its game on sustainability”. “But this decision
  protects the commercial salmon industry and condemns the skate to extinction.”
  Carr said Tasmanians were “sick and tired of government inaction to address
  the harmful effects of the foreign-owned salmon industry on Tasmanian
  waterways.” The Maugean skate has been listed as endangered since 2004.
  Concern about its plight escalated last year when a government scientific
  committee said numbers in the wild were “extremely low” and fish farming in
  the harbour was the main cause of a substantial reduction in dissolved oxygen
  levels – the main threat to the skate’s survival. The committee said salmon
  farms in the harbour should be scaled back and recommended the species be
  considered critically endangered. A separate report by the Institute for
  Marine and Antarctic Studies earlier this year said surveys suggested the
  skate population was likely to have recovered to 2014 levels after crashing
  last decade. It stressed the need for continued monitoring.
