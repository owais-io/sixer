  Why is winking considered cheeky? What about briefly closing one eye suggests
  impudence, flirtatiousness or mischievousness? Caroline, by email Send new
  questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply Winking has to be interpreted
  in context. Yes, it can be cheeky, but it can also serve as an affectionate
  show of support (“you got this!”), a flirtatious gesture or, as the Canadian
  prime minister so masterfully employed it, a signal to the world that one
  fully understands the absurd circumstance in which he finds himself. Winking
  at someone in the wrong context could obviously land you in an awkward or even
  confrontational dilemma. Because it’s so versatile, we must have situational
  awareness and an understanding of the audience. GlimmerTwinTX Social
  anthropologists believe that winking originated from a deeply ingrained need
  to find a use for the semicolon key prior to the invention of the emoji.
  EddieChorepost Winking is considered cheekier than blinking. Otherwise, we’d
  be very naughty indeed. gleebitz Because the English are sex mad. Tavennaser
  There are certain interesting features to winking. It’s silent, so it can be
  directed (to some extent) towards or away from people. It parasitises an
  automatic, unconscious behaviour and gives it a kind of explicit
  intentionality. It’s quick, potentially private and, for that reason, can be
  played off as ambiguous. It’s done with the eyes, which we might think are
  potentially leaking out truth and feeling. So there’s a potential for
  subversion of the social space in winking, by embedding a private moment that
  can’t be readily fact-checked. LaszloPanaflex Because it enables you to apply
  mascara without opening your mouth? Paulo777 Winking, cheeky? Yes, when you do
  it your cheek moves up. So yes, cheeky. catchytitled Ah yes, well, you see,
  English has developed mostly from East Frisian and is a Germanic language, as
  is German. Due to the existence of the North Sea, some of the word meanings
  have evolved in a slightly different manner. In German, the verb “winken”
  means to wave, predominantly to attract someone’s attention, including of
  course the “yoo-hoo I think you’re gorgeous” wave across a crowded beer hall,
  the discreet wave of “shall we meet later?” and the small wave in front of the
  mouth meaning “you can share my secret if you want”. Meanwhile, across the
  Nordsee, “winken” has evolved into winking, to which has been added a touch of
  so-called British understatement, thus causing a reduction of movement from
  the hand to a not-always-so-subtle movement of the muscles around one eye. Add
  the natural loucheness of some of Britons and we arrive at the present
  situation. A blazer, a cravat and the shirt collar outside complete the
  evolutionary process. bricklayersoption
