  Aston Villa have failed with a loan bid for Lucas Paquetá, who could miss West
  Ham’s trip to Nottingham Forest on Sunday because of doubts over his future.
  The proposed deal contained an obligation to buy. Paquetá is understood to be
  open to a transfer and is understood to have misgivings over playing at the
  City Ground. However, sources at West Ham are surprised at suggestions the
  midfielder is reluctant to appear for Graham Potter’s troubled side. There
  were no signs of Paquetá being unhappy in training and he has travelled with
  the rest of the squad. Rumblings of discontent have emanated from those around
  Paquetá after West Ham’s poor start to the season. Tottenham expressed an
  interest in the 28-year-old this month and Villa have inquired about his
  situation. It remains to be seen if Villa, who have restrictions around the
  Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations, are able to
  meet West Ham’s £60m valuation. West Ham have little desire to lose Paquetá,
  who became their record signing three years ago, before the window shuts on
  Monday night. They feel that he owes them after they stood by him before he
  was found innocent of breaching the Football Association’s betting
  regulations. West Ham are prepared to sell Paquetá next summer but doing so
  now would give them little time to find a suitable replacement. However the
  situation sheds a light into the problems confronting Potter, who faces a
  battle to lift the mood in the dressing room. Nayef Aguerd is not expected to
  feature against Forest. The Morocco defender wants to leave West Ham and is a
  target for Sunderland and Marseille. West Ham are looking at Toulouse’s
  Charlie Cresswell and Southampton’s Taylor Harwood-Bellis as possible
  replacements for Aguerd. There could be several departures from West Ham
  during the final two days of the window. Emerson Palmieri is joining
  Marseille. Guido Rodríguez is a target for Espanyol, Tomas Soucek has interest
  from Everton and Wrexham are trying to sign Andy Irving. West Ham, who have
  lost their first two league games and crashed out of the Carabao Cup, had
  lifted the mood on Friday by strengthening their midfield with the signings of
  Mateus Fernandes and Soungoutou Magassa. Potter is looking to add lower the
  age of his squad and wants to alter the culture in the dressing room. Many of
  the players who want out are not in Potter’s long-term plans. Newcastle have
  signed the German forward Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart in a club-record deal
  reportedly worth £69m. He was at Elland Road on Saturday to watch his new team
  draw 0-0 with Leeds. The 23-year-old’s deal eclipses the £63m Newcastle paid
  for Alexander Isak three years ago when the Sweden striker, now wanted by
  Liverpool, became the club’s most expensive player. Woltemade came through
  Werder Bremen’s academy and became their youngest Bundesliga debutant in 2020
  at the age of 17. He joined Stuttgart last year and scored 17 goals in 33
  appearances across all competitions Eddie Howe, the Newcastle manager, said:
  “We are delighted to get Nick’s signing over the line so quickly. He fits the
  profile for exactly what we have been looking for to add to our attacking
  options. “He’s strong in a lot of areas – he has great technical ability and
  has proven himself to be a real threat in one of Europe’s top leagues – but
  he’s also still at an age where he has plenty of room to develop and grow
  here.“ Capped twice by Germany, the 1.98-metre forward has been called up for
  the World Cup qualifiers against Slovakia and Northern Ireland in September.
  “It’s a big step in my life to leave Germany but everybody has welcomed me so
  well and it already feels like family,” Woltemade said. “I have a really good
  feeling from speaking to the head coach that this is the right place for me to
  find my best level … From the first contact, I felt like the club really
  wanted me and had big plans for me.” Nottingham Forest have signed the
  defender Nicolò Savona from Juventus on a five-year deal. The 22-year-old
  played 40 times for Juventus after making his debut in August 2024. Savona, an
  Italy Under-21s international – who was called into the senior squad last
  November – told the Forest website: “I am very excited to be here. It is a new
  experience for me as a person and a player. It is such a historic club and the
  move is a dream come true.” Fulham have confirmed the Brazil midfielder
  Andreas Pereira has joined Palmeiras. The former Manchester United player’s
  switch to the Brazilian side ends a three-year stay at Craven Cottage, where
  he made 119 appearances for the club. He told the Fulham website: “From the
  first day at Fulham, I felt at home. Thank you to my teammates, staff, and
  fans for every moment. After three years, I leave proud of what we achieved
  together. Fulham will always be part of me.” Aberdeen have completed the
  signing of 19-year-old Celtic left-back Mitchel Frame for an undisclosed fee.
  The Scotland Under-19 international, who played for the Hoops in a Champions
  League win over Feyenoord in 2023, has signed a four-year deal.
