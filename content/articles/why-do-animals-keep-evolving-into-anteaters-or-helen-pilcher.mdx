  Who doesn’t love an anteater? I mean, apart from ants, obviously. With their
  long snouts and even longer sticky tongues, they trundle around, slurping up
  insects like milkshakes. They have handsome, bushy tails, which they wrap
  around themselves at night like a blanket. And they’re excellent parents.
  Giant anteater mothers allow their young to cling to their backs,
  rucksack-style, for periods of up to a year. Indeed, the surrealist artist
  Salvador Dalí was so taken with the giant anteater that he once took one for a
  walk through the streets of Paris. And before you ask, no, this wasn’t a
  cheese dream. There is photographic evidence. As if that weren’t enough, a
  recent study published in the journal Evolution has found that mammals have
  evolved into anteaters not once, not twice, but 12 times since the demise of
  the dinosaurs some 66m years ago. Anteaters, it seems, are a recurring trend.
  The finding prompted the study’s lead author, Thomas Vida from the University
  of Bonn, to tell Science magazine: “Things keep evolving into anteaters,
  somehow.” Which raises the question: will humans one day follow suit? By
  “things”, Vida means mammals, and by “anteaters” he includes the four species
  of anteater from Central and South America, the pangolins and aardvarks of
  Africa and Asia, and the echidnas of Australia. Different animals, on
  different continents, that all practise myrmecophagy, also known as the
  consumption of termites and ants. If you were a parent of young children,
  you’d call them fussy eaters. If you were an evolutionary biologist, however,
  you’d point out that they’re not being deliberately difficult. Instead, they
  have evolved to fill a very particular ecological niche. That niche is
  provided by the world’s extensive population of ants and termites, some 15,000
  species, whose collective biomass is more than 10 times greater than that of
  all wild mammals. At least a dozen times in evolutionary history, mammals
  decided that if you can’t beat them, eat them, and began to consume the
  crunchy delicacy. Such an abundant food source can act as what biologists call
  a “selective pressure”. Characteristics that enabled animals to eat more ants
  and termites – and thus survive better – are more likely to be passed on. Over
  millions of years, animals from all three major groups of mammal life,
  including marsupials and the egg-laying monotremes, evolved to have long,
  sticky tongues, reduced or missing teeth and strong forelimbs for busting into
  insect nests. It’s a powerful example of convergent evolution, the phenomenon
  by which different species, in different places or times, independently evolve
  similar characteristics. Faced with the same problem – how do I eat these
  ants? – they all arrived at a similar solution. So, though they’re not closely
  related, they possess features that are superficially similar. Convergent
  evolution is how echolocation (the ability to determine the location of
  objects using reflected sound) evolved separately in bats and dolphins,
  camera-like eyes evolved in octopuses and vertebrates, and opposable digits
  evolved in primates, koalas and chameleons. Powered flight has evolved
  independently at least four times – in birds, bats, pterosaurs and insects –
  and venom production more than 100 times, while crustaceans have evolved the
  classic, crab-like body plan at least five times. Known as carcinisation, it
  has spawned crabby memes aplenty. The evolutionary biologist Simon Conway
  Morris has used convergent evolution to argue that evolution is both
  deterministic and predictable. Rewind the tape of life, play it over again and
  similar-looking lifeforms would evolve, he says. This means that in theory,
  with enough time (many tens of millions of years), the appearance and
  retention of the requisite genetic mutations and, critically, the same
  selective pressures that shaped the emergence of former ant-eating animals,
  some mammals – including maybe us – could evolve gummy mouths and sticky
  tongues. Forget the history books, it’s the cookery books that would be
  rewritten. Only there’s a fly in the ointment. We’re wrong to presume that
  because myrmecophagy has evolved multiple times, it is the pinnacle of some
  evolutionary tree. There are, after all, many more mammals that have not
  evolved into anteaters than have started breaking into termite mounds. The
  fact that convergent evolution occurs does not necessarily make it the default
  pathway. In addition, evolution has a way of pulling the rug. It can be
  predictable, but it can also be quirky and erratic. In his 1989 book,
  Wonderful Life, another titan of evolutionary biology, Stephen Jay Gould,
  argued for the importance of random events. These can be anything from
  lightning strikes to asteroid impacts: any unforeseen occurrence that derails
  the prevailing trajectory of evolution and sends it along a different path. In
  other words, “sliding doors” moments that have been influencing evolution for
  as long as there has been life on Earth. So, just because things kept
  “evolving into anteaters” in the past, doesn’t mean that history will repeat
  itself. Which is a shame. Anteaters and aardvarks don’t typically eat all of
  the ants or termites in a nest, but leave some behind so the colony can
  rebuild itself. This makes them the epitome of sustainable living. If we can’t
  evolve into them, we can at least learn from them. Bring Back the King by
