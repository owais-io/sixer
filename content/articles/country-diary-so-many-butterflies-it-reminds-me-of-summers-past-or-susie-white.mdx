  Two red admiral butterflies chase and spiral above the buddleia, flashing red
  and black wings against blue sky. Small tortoiseshells forage among the yellow
  radiating petals of Inula hookeri. Speckled wood and comma land beside them,
  two at once sharing a flower. A peacock flicks its large wings open and shut,
  each time revealing false eyes and sleek hairy body. It’s a relief to see so
  many familiar butterflies feeding on familiar flowers. This time last year was
  very different. Then, I wrote in my Country Diary about their absence, despite
  the abundance of nectar plants here – the effect of a cold, wet winter and
  spring. When the results came in from the Big Butterfly Count (BBC), Butterfly
  Conservation declared a butterfly emergency. What a contrast this year. The
  initial results of the 2025 BBC have confirmed what so many of us suspected:
  that we are seeing butterflies more frequently and in greater numbers this
  summer than last, helped by the warm, dry spring. White butterflies, large and
  small, so far top the chart – full results are at the end of August – followed
  by gatekeeper, red admiral and meadow brown. What I’m seeing in my own garden
  echoes this. High numbers of large whites and green-veined whites flying
  around our veg. Meadow browns and small heaths on the purple-pink marjoram
  alongside numerous bumblebees and honeybees. Speckled wood and comma – two
  species that are gradually moving north – are plentiful. So much beauty too.
  The underwings of a painted lady glow orange, bathed in the reflected light of
  calendula petals. Daytime moths are also frequent. Large yellow underwings and
  dark arches on sea holly, the occasional thrill of a hummingbird hawk-moth –
  but not yet the more southern-based Jersey tiger, whose numbers, according to
  the initial BBC results, have soared this year. There’s a wonderful sense of
  continuity at seeing the butterflies of my childhood, and similar in number
  (at least to my memory) of summers past. This year’s profusion doesn’t, of
  course, reverse their long-term decline, but it does feel more hopeful.
  Sitting here, watching the constant movement, I realise what easy joy
  butterflies bring – and how much I missed them last year. • Under the Changing
