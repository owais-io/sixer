  Twelve minutes into an interview with Allen Ginsberg for the BBC’s Face to
  Face, Jeremy Isaacs asks him about the extraordinary long poem he wrote about
  his mother: “In Kaddish, you mourn your mother. What was the effect on you of
  living with a mother who was mad?” Ginsberg’s answer, mildly inflected by a
  laugh, is: “It gave me a great sort of … tolerance for eccentric behaviour.”
  Arundhati Roy, whose memoir is partly an account of her life with her mother
  Mary Roy, might recognise this insight. Arguably, all mothers appear to their
  children as mad: madness here meaning an unbounded force, at odds with what
  society imagines normal parenting to consist of. The manifestations of this
  madness are as disparate as those of love, and these two aspects – the
  abnormal, the overbearing, and the protective, the nurturing – can be, in our
  mothers, intimately intertwined (“She was my shelter and my storm,” writes
  Roy). It is through loving and depending on the mysterious and
  incomprehensible that we come to “tolerate”, even embrace, the strangest thing
  of all: life itself. Mary Roy was a kind of visionary, but she seemed to drive
  people around her mad, as well as being frequently driven mad by them. A
  Christian from Kerala, she escaped her parents by marrying a member of the
  Bengali bourgeoisie, known to his friends as Micky Roy, before leaving him
  when he became an alcoholic, “a Nothing Man”. She took her children, Arundhati
  and her brother Lalith, to a “cottage that belonged to our maternal
  grandfather” in Tamil Nadu, but came up against her family’s invocation of a
  law governing inheritance in her community: “daughters had no right to their
  father’s property and we were to leave the house immediately”. Finally they
  came to Aymanam, a village in Kerala (spelled “Ayemenem” by Roy, recognisable
  as the village in The God of Small Things), staying first with their family,
  “extraordinary, eccentric, cosmopolitan people, defeated by life”, before once
  more falling out with them. Mary then set up her own home and, eventually, a
  school that developed a national reputation. Mary Roy’s years of doing battle
  allowed her to leave two remarkable legacies: her school, but also the case
  she eventually fought against her family, which went all the way to the
  supreme court, and resulted in the annulment of the discriminatory inheritance
  law. In the meantime, she seemed to be perpetually at war, often for no clear
  reason, with her children, especially her daughter: “In my effort to fathom my
  mother, to see things from her perspective … to understand what hurt her, what
  made her do the things she did … I turned into a maze … hoping to gain a
  vantage point for a perspective other than my own.” This attempt to understand
  the compulsion to love what seems hostile transforms Roy’s writing, lending
  her prose, especially in the first 130 or so pages, an unprecedented freedom.
  An astringent conscience-keeper in the political sphere, she finds herself,
  with her mother as the subject, on terrain that tests her in quite a different
  way. We discover, in these sections, an ability to transition between
  contraries, a fluency that is less “empathy” than something unpredictable and
  alchemical. Note, for example, the paradoxically liberating role the word
  “fortunately” plays in this sentence about her mother, brother, and herself:
  “He remembered being loved. Fortunately, I didn’t.” Or the defiantly jubilant
  assertion, “I loved killing them”, about the lice the family help would comb
  out of her hair. The world described in the first part of the book provides
  much of the material for The God of Small Things. But these pages aren’t
  significant for giving us access to Roy’s inspiration, or as a preamble to her
  life as a bestselling writer who would go on to become an oppositional
  political voice. Even if she were none of these things or had never written
  her novel, they would be utterly absorbing. They have a wonderful,
  self-assured self-sufficiency. In the late 1970s, Roy escaped her mother,
  arriving in Delhi and enrolling in the School of Planning and Architecture
  there. At this point the memoir also bears witness to a world-historical
  shift: the receding of a kind of modernity and politics which had given rise
  to experimental lives and ways of thinking. Both Gandhi and Rabindranath
  Tagore, despite the great gulf between their backgrounds and world views,
  embodied the open-endedness made possible by such experimentation. So did Mary
  Roy and her brother George Isaac in their various projects and vicissitudes.
  I’d also situate Micky Roy in this context: one of the funniest, most moving
  sections in this book has to do with Arundhati’s reunion with her father in a
  hotel in Delhi: “He was lying on his stomach with his knees bent, his feet
  waving at the ceiling.” This shift ultimately created the world we inhabit
  today. Even before the precipitous slide towards the far right now evident
  almost everywhere, there was the feverish globalisation that engendered a
  liberal elite just as bizarre as any of its political opponents. These changes
  are – explicitly and implicitly – the subject of the second half of the book.
  They are woven into Roy’s continual, courageous confrontations with the
  nation-state, including her criticism of its nuclear policies and opposition
  to Sardar Sarovar dam. Roy loves India deeply, but the nation-state isn’t
  India, and it doesn’t love her back. The conflict is comparable to, albeit
  profoundly different from, her relationship with Mary Roy. Globalisation is
  also woven into Roy’s overnight success: it becomes a kind of co-author of her
  first novel. That success was akin to an inheritance left to a writer in the
  18th century by an obscure uncle: something Roy benefits from but whose
  meaning she must also grapple with. In the midst of this, Mary Roy re-enters
  her daughter’s life, the mother delighted by Arundhati’s celebrity, but also
  puncturing it occasionally with Dadaist zeal. Throughout the book, but with
  especial force in the second half, Mrs Roy’s resistance and recalcitrance are
  an invigorating antidote to whatever our new world preaches is most rewarding
  about life. • Mother Mary Comes To Me is published by Penguin (£20). To
