  Steve Barron (director): [Hong Kong production company] Golden Harvest didn’t
  know whether to use creature suits or hand-drawn animation like Who Framed
  Roger Rabbit. The cartoon series was becoming quite popular so they thought:
  “Maybe the cartoon characters could come into a live-action film?” I thought:
  “No. This has to be real and in the sewers where it’s moody.” I didn’t get
  anything cinematic from the cartoon. I did from the comic book. Josh Pais
  (Raphael): They flew us to London to get body casted. I was in the back room
  of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop with my arms out to the side suspended by ropes.
  They started covering my body in plaster and did the back of my body first.
  Then they started my front, neck and my face. They put straws in my nose so I
  could breathe. The plaster gets warm as it sets and everything was heating up.
  I couldn’t hear and things started accelerating so I went inward. Later, they
  said they kept me in longer than they needed to see if I’d freak out. Leif
  Tilden (Donatello): I had no idea what it took to create these creatures. It
  was like the Nasa of puppetry. Falkor’s head from The NeverEnding Story was
  lying in the corner. Characters from The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth were
  hanging from the ceiling. I was down the rabbit hole. David Forman (Leonardo):
  I did a lot of animal work. If you wanted a bear or gorilla, you’d come to me.
  A talking character was a challenge. Design-wise, we had creases and stretch
  in our joints. It was designed so we could kick, punch and have full
  dexterity. The costumes were built in stages. There was a chest piece, leg,
  feet and hand pieces. We married them together with elbow and knee props. SB:
  Jim [Henson] was worried about the weapons and fighting. It took a bit of
  persuasion but after a while he trusted me. I said: “I’m going to keep the
  spirit warm and tender and the tone will be something you’ll be proud of.”
  Luckily, he went for it. I don’t think it could have been done without him.
  Michelan Sisti (Michelangelo): I happened to be at the Creature Shop when Dave
  did his first test in the full suit. I remember him rolling around and doing
  all this stuff. After about 30 minutes, I asked him: “What’s it like?” He
  said: “Not good,” and he was in fantastic shape. He knew about the pain to
  come. DF: I was used to working in heavy suits. Sweating, working blind,
  knowing my 360 degree markers. I did struggle with the weight of the costume
  because we had so many batteries in the shell to work the servos in the head.
  There was a lot of weight on our hips and lower backs. We were literally on
  all fours most of the time, looking like turtles, but in pain. LT: The suits
  were sculpted to our physical shape precisely so even the subtlest movement
  would move them. Also, you had to develop ways of living in a different
  temperature. SB: They knew these suits were going to be heavy and hot but they
  didn’t know how hot or heavy, until we were in North Carolina shooting. The
  heat was intense. Poor Josh was the only actor of the four who hadn’t done
  performance costumes before and he found it difficult. It brought on a bit of
  claustrophobia. JP: It felt like your blood was boiling. One of us would lose
  it and shout: “Take the head off! Take the head off!” Our heads were a
  separate piece and glued on so it wasn’t a simple process. They had to undo
  the glue. Sometimes, if one of us had that freak out, others would too. It was
  like a fever. The producers weren’t happy because it slowed everything down.
  DF: There’s very little oxygen in the head so between takes, we had blowers
  pointed at our open mouths to get some more air into us. MS: I was the
  experimental turtle. Everybody was overheating so they tried cooling vests
  designed for astronauts. I had one that circulated liquid. They put it on and
  asked me to work up a sweat. They turned on the pump and I immediately got an
  entire body cramp and fell over. The pump said, “Do not put ice in” and
  somebody put ice in it. The temperature change to my overheated core nearly
  killed me. JP: They created a room with plastic sheathing around it with air
  conditioners in. It had benches we would sit at with our arms up and heads
  down. SB: We built a wooden horse for them to sit on that they could drape
  their arms over. There was a fan in the middle that’d blow air through the
  mouth. Looking at all four of them on that was like a Damien Hirst sculpture.
  LT: The first time the four of us were together for the opening “Cowabunga”
  sewer scene was a jungle of challenges. The art director created a sewer that
  was so realistic. It was moist and very slippery. JP: We were dying. There was
  water running under our feet. We were all having vision problems. If one of us
  stopped, we’d smash into each other. It was a relatively simple 45 second
  sequence but it took at least 12 hours. Everything kept going wrong. MS: The
  sewers were treacherous. Every time we jumped around the corner, one of us
  would slip and fall. Eventually, somebody suggested taking the bottoms off our
  legs and wearing sneakers. If you slow down the video when Dave comes into
  frame, you can see his legs as he jumps down. SB: It would’ve been a lot
  easier if there were only two turtles, that’s for sure. SB: The turtle faces
  were radio controlled by nearby puppeteers. In North Carolina, sometimes a
  plane would land a mile away right in the middle of a take and suddenly, the
  turtles’ faces would twitch and start going crazy. SB: The campfire scene
  where they connect with Splinter is a big one. Michelangelo is crying and it’s
  clear how much they care for their father. There were a few underlying themes
  but the strongest was family. LT: We were stoned out of our minds. I smoked
  half a joint before we did it. JP: Leif pulled out a blunt and we were like:
  “Yeah. Come on!” We’d all been through so much. It gives me chills thinking
  about it. It was a spiritual experience and the buzz took it deeper. DF: That
  was a wonderful sequence. Connecting with our father, Splinter, and the whole
  ambience of that scene. DF: The fans are so grateful we kept in touch. They
  constantly thank us for being there for them in the 1990s. Grown adults say:
  “You were my childhood hero.” It’s helped all sorts of people for different
  reasons. JP: People come up to me with tears in their eyes saying: “You helped
  me through my childhood.” A lot had anger issues like Raphael and say watching
  the movie over and over made them see they weren’t alone. It’s an adult film
  for kids. It doesn’t talk down to them. It challenges them to step up within
  themselves. SB: Many more people have stayed connected to it than I expected.
  Youngsters have carried it into their 40s. Lots of people come forward saying
  this was the best adaptation. You take it with a pinch of salt – but it’s nice
  to hear. • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie is in US cinemas from
  Thursday 28 August. Lose Your Mind: The Path to Creative Invincibility by Josh
  Pais is published on 30 September.
