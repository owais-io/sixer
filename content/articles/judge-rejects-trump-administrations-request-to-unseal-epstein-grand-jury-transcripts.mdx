  The government lost its bid to unseal grand jury transcripts in the
  sex-trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein. Richard Berman, a federal judge
  in New York, said the transcripts pale in comparison to the documents the
  government already has on Epstein and that disclosing them could harm victims.
  The ruling comes after a different judge ruled against disclosure in a
  separate effort to unseal transcripts in a case against Ghislaine Maxwell,
  Epstein’s former girlfriend. Maxwell is in prison on a 20-year sentence after
  she was convicted of sex trafficking for aiding Epstein’s sexual abuses.
  Epstein, who died by suicide in custody in 2019 while awaiting trial, sexually
  abused hundreds of girls and women and operated a sex-trafficking ring over
  decades. He was connected with some of the world’s most powerful people.
  Documents related to his conduct could reveal his connections, how he made his
  money and how he was able to evade justice for so long. The government was
  seeking to unseal 70 pages of grand jury transcripts, exhibits including a
  PowerPoint presentation, four pages of call logs and letters from victims and
  their attorneys, from proceedings that took place in 2019. The motions to
  unseal the documents came as the Trump administration is under intense
  scrutiny from its supporters over failure to release Epstein files in its
  possession. Trump had previously promised to release the files, a longtime
  goal for the Maga movement, and now has sought to tamp down fury among his
  Maga acolytes over the files. Trump and Epstein were once friends, and his
  entanglements have come under renewed examination. The government has said it
  has massive amount of investigative materials into Epstein, but said in July
  that it would not be releasing more. Some of the materials are under
  court-ordered seals, and victims’ information is woven throughout the
  documents. The government said then that there was no “client list” among its
  materials. In his ruling, Berman wrote that the government already has vastly
  more files on Epstein in its possession than what it was seeking to unseal.
  “The government’s 100,000 pages of Epstein files and materials dwarf the 70
  odd pages of Epstein grand jury materials,” he wrote. Seeking to unseal the
  grand jury documents appears a “diversion” from releasing documents in the
  government’s possession, he wrote, and the government failed to make the case
  for unsealing the documents. The grand jury materials largely consist of the
  testimony of an FBI agent, the sole witness in the grand jury proceedings,
  “who had no direct knowledge of the facts of the case and whose testimony was
  mostly hearsay”. One compelling reason to keep the documents under seal, he
  wrote, is “possible threats to victims’ safety and privacy”. Victims and their
  attorneys said they wanted to be sure they weren’t put in harm by disclosures,
  and anonymous victims did not want their identities revealed. Similarly, in
  the Maxwell grand jury proceedings, only two law enforcement officers
  testified, undermining the idea that unsealing the documents would grant
  access to a trove of earth-shattering documents. “Insofar as the motion to
  unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine lode of
  undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they
  definitively are not that,” wrote Manhattan federal court judge Paul
  Engelmayer in his rejection earlier this month. Separately, the House
  oversight committee said it would be releasing documents it expects to receive
  from a subpoena to the justice department. The committee will conduct a
  “thorough review to ensure all victims’ identification and child sexual abuse
  material are redacted” before public release.
