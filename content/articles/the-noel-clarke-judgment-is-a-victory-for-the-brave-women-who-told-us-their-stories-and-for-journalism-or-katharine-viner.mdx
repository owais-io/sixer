  Sometimes you just need to pull on the thread. That’s how it started for two
  Guardian reporters in the spring of 2021, when they began to investigate
  claims about the behaviour of Noel Clarke, the prominent British actor and
  filmmaker. Sirin Kale and Lucy Osborne spoke to many sources, including more
  than 20 women who shared their stories about working with Clarke. Their
  accusations covered all manner of misconduct: sexual harassment, unwanted
  touching and groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour, taking and sharing
  sexually explicit pictures and videos without consent, and bullying. The
  allegations spanned a long period, from 2004 to 2019 and were the basis of a
  powerful series of Guardian articles and a podcast, which led to Clarke suing
  the Guardian. The six-week trial took place in the high court in March and
  April, and the judgment came in today. Mrs Justice Steyn ruled that what the
  Guardian published was true, and that publishing it was in the public
  interest. The judge praised our reporters’ and editors’ exhaustive approach to
  covering the story and noted the “extensive efforts they made to investigate,
  test and corroborate the information they received, and not to publish
  allegations which they could not substantiate”. It is an overwhelming victory
  for the women who spoke to us, for the Guardian, and for investigative
  journalism in Britain. Almost every day over my decade as editor-in-chief of
  the Guardian I have had to take difficult decisions. In many ways, deciding to
  fight Noel Clarke’s defamation claim was not one of them. I believed from the
  start this was a case we needed to see through to the end – primarily, of
  course, for the women who had spoken to us for our original investigation, and
  those who then came to the court to give testimony. I remember when I was
  first told about the investigation: what struck me was the sheer scale of it
  all. In cases where there are claims of sexual misconduct, even post the
  #MeToo movement, it is rare to find women who are prepared to speak to
  journalists. When you’re talking about someone who is much more powerful than
  you are, and is a big name in the film and TV industry, it’s a huge risk. Yet
  every time I received an update from the investigations team, the numbers of
  women had risen. Within days, we had more than a dozen sources. By the time we
  had published our first investigation we had heard credible first-hand
  allegations from 22 women, and our superb reporters had done extensive work on
  corroboration. By the time we published our last article, we had spoken to
  more than 100 sources. At trial we were able to rely on testimony from 26
  different people, some of whom had travelled to the high court from abroad.
  The many women who came to give testimony in court did not flinch, despite the
  often intimidating tactics used to try to deter them both before and during
  the trial. I attended court most days and found it very moving that so many of
  the women came forward and spoke so powerfully and with such commitment about
  some of the worst times of their lives. As the great British writer, actor and
  director Michaela Coel wrote about our sources: “Speaking about these
  incidents takes a lot of strength because some call them ‘grey areas’. They
  are, however, far from grey. These behaviours are unprofessional, violent, and
  can destroy a person’s perception of themselves, their places in the world,
  and their career irreparably.” One of those witnesses, Gina Powell, a former
  employee of Clarke’s, was an important source in our reporting and a witness
  at the trial in March. Powell accused Clarke of sexually assaulting her and
  told the court that she was speaking up because she did not think he should be
  “around young women in the film industry”. Her decision to speak out, like
  that of all of our witnesses, was incredibly brave. In addition to calling her
  an impressive, honest, compelling witness who did not overstate or exaggerate
  any of the matters she addressed, Mrs Justice Steyn said of her: “Courage is
  not evinced by the absence of fear but by mastering it, and Ms Powell
  demonstrated admirable bravery and integrity.” The Guardian stood by Gina and
  all these women, and the media as a whole will benefit from the bravery the
  women showed, thanks to a judgment that has fully vindicated their decision to
  come forward. So this judgment is a victory for them. It is also an important
  exoneration of the Guardian – our reporters, editors and lawyers.
  Investigative journalism is risky and expensive, and reporting that involves
  allegations of sexual misconduct is famously extremely challenging to publish.
  There is the constant threat of litigation, which is unpleasant and
  time-consuming. There is the toll that it takes on the witnesses, who may have
  already suffered abuse, and who can often, understandably, feel they cannot
  put themselves through the trauma of a gruelling court case. That’s also
  something faced by our journalists. Six of us were cross-examined in the high
  court. One reporter was on the stand for three days. Another was the subject
  of extremely personalised questioning. Baseless allegations of a “conspiracy”
  were levelled. All performed superbly, standing up for journalism in the
  public interest, standing up for the Guardian. And then there is the threat of
  ruinous costs. At one point, and doubtless in an attempt to force us to settle
  the case on his terms before the trial, Noel Clarke tried to increase his
  damages claim to the eye-watering sum of £70m. The Guardian is lucky to have
  the support of the Scott Trust behind us – our owners, who are committed to
  journalism in the public interest rather than pursuing commercial or political
  interests. They backed the journalism every step of the way. Few defamation
  cases make it to trial precisely because of the financial and reputational
  jeopardy. But this was a case where I felt the Guardian needed to take a stand
  and trust in the women, our journalism and the court process. It’s a good day
  for the Guardian, for media in the public interest, and for women. Katharine
