  A January 6 defendant who urged fellow rioters to kill police officers should
  be fired from his job at the justice department, three Senate Democrats wrote
  in a letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, on Wednesday. Earlier this
  year, the defendant, Jared Wise, was hired as a counselor to Ed Martin, a
  prominent January 6 defense lawyer who is leading a so-called weaponization
  working group inside the justice department that is targeting Trump’s
  political rivals. The scope of Wise’s role remains unclear. A former FBI
  agent, Wise referred to police officers as “Nazis” and “Gestapo” on January 6.
  As violence broke out, Wise said: “Kill ’em! Kill ’em! Kill ’em!”, according
  to an FBI affidavit. Wise was charged with two felonies and four misdemeanors.
  He was on trial for two felony charges related to January 6 when Donald Trump
  was inaugurated in January, but his case was dismissed as the president
  quickly halted all prosecutions related to the 2021 insurrection and issued
  sweeping pardons to all involved. “We strongly object to the Department of
  Justice’s (DOJ) shameless hiring of Jared Wise as a senior adviser. This is an
  individual who stormed the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, and was
  accordingly charged with multiple felony offenses, including assaulting and
  aiding and abetting the assault of police while on Capitol grounds,” the
  Democratic senators Dick Durbin of Illinois, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode
  Island and Adam Schiff of California wrote in a letter to Bondi. “The Trump
  Administration’s choices to double down on its politicization of DOJ and
  elevate those who have actively attacked the rule of law, such as Mr Wise, are
  a slap in the face to law enforcement everywhere. “A transparent explanation
  regarding the circumstances of this hire and the prompt removal of Jared Wise
  from his position at the Department of Justice are critical to maintaining
  public trust in the Department. To that end, we request the immediate
  termination of Mr Wise’s employment,” they added. The Democrats also asked
  Bondi to provide details of Wise’s role at the department, including his
  security clearance level, portfolio and a detailed description of his job. The
  letter also asks the department to provide a description of his relationship
  with Martin as well as any communications between the two men. The justice
  department did not immediately return a request for comment. Wise’s hiring at
  the justice department marked one of the most brazen efforts by Trump and
  allies to rewrite the history of January 6. In addition to granting sweeping
  pardons to more than 1,500 people involved in the riot, Trump and allies have
  demoted or fired career prosecutors who worked on the cases. The
  administration also has agreed to grant military funeral honors to Ashli
  Babbitt, an air force veteran and January 6 rioter who was killed during the
  Capitol attack, and pay her family nearly $5m to settle a wrongful death
  lawsuit. Mark McCloskey, a lawyer for some January 6 defendants, said he had
  recently approached the justice department about setting up a panel to
  compensate January 6 rioters.
