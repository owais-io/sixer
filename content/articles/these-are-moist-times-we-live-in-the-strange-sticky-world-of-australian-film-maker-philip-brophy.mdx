  In the long list of words that humans find disgusting, “moist” ranks among the
  most hated and the most innocuous. Why is this word so objectionable? Is it
  the mere suggestion of something displeasing? The mouthfeel? Or is it just
  social conditioning? According to the Australian film-maker Philip Brophy in
  the opening crawl of his 1988 experimental short Salt, Saliva, Sperm and
  Sweat, “These are moist times we live in … and things just keep getting
  wetter.” Don’t believe him? See for yourself. After whetting appetites back in
  the 80s, the Melbourne mainstay’s early films are returning to Melbourne
  international film festival – where they first screened. Almost four decades
  on, Salt, Saliva, Sperm and Sweat and No Dance have been lovingly restored by
  the same cinematographer who first shot them – Ray Argall – for the twisted
  enjoyment of a whole new generation of thrill-seeking moviegoers. From his
  groundbreaking Warhol Factory-esque experimental group → ↑ → (for those who
  can’t read arrows, that’s “Tsk Tsk Tsk”) to his collaborative partnership with
  legendary avant garde artist Maria Kozic, Philip Brophy is hardly being
  rediscovered. In fact, a whole generation of art students know Brophy as their
  teacher – among other things, he continues to lecture on film and sound at
  Melbourne’s RMIT. Much like Brophy’s uproarious suburban-horror feature Body
  Melt, the lesser seen Salt, Saliva, Sperm and Sweat delivers what is promised
  in its title. The film is broken down into four chapters over four days, each
  following what is essentially the same story. Man wakes up, man goes to work,
  man makes a total mess. With each instalment, we follow the central figure,
  brought to life by the cartoonishly slack-jawed Phillip Dean who, save for a
  few swearwords, remains mute for the whole film. Sign up for our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning
  Taking inspiration from the emergent technologies of the 80s, Brophy
  transforms his frame into a computer screen filled with text. Wordy
  proclamations are bold if somewhat inchoate, such as: “What’s inside a body?
  More bodies. Body whole, body parts, body fluids. We are already inside out
  but we don’t know it yet.” What the hell, sure! But Brophy’s treatise is also
  starkly prophetic, particularly when he raises the political concerns of a
  climate catastrophe still being defined back in 1988. The icecaps are melting,
  holes in the ozone have changed rainfall patterns, but there is “no spring of
  knowledge, no well of contentment” for us to fall back on, he warns. “Sink or
  swim – float if you’re lucky.” So the true horror of Salt, Saliva, Sperm and
  Sweat isn’t so much being subjected to watching a turd slowly drop into a
  toilet bowl, but in discovering jaded art about the climate crisis was being
  made almost four decades ago. Perhaps more so than his contributions as a
  film-maker, Brophy is known for his work as a composer and musician, and Salt,
  Saliva, Sperm and Sweat has a signature Brophy score that will stick with you.
  Take, for example, the repetitious single rhythm created with the drum
  machine: ba / ba-ba-ba / ba / ba, which imitates the syllabic pattern of the
  film’s title: salt / sa-li-va / sperm / sweat. No Dance, Brophy’s other
  offering at this year’s Miff, is a film about the advent of electronic music
  and the human urge to dance. Before being reshot in 16mm in 1985, a Super 8
  version of No Dance was shown in music venues across Sydney and Melbourne.
  Ironically, the original was destroyed precisely because Brophy chose to
  project it on to the stages of the same sweaty nightclubs the film sought to
  document. In this experimental work, best described as a free form video essay
  with rhythm, Brophy interrogates the juncture of rock and disco at a time when
  digital synthesisers and programmable drum machines were calling people back
  to the dancefloor. Like any good DJ, he blends musical styles and dance
  sensibilities, sometimes so freely that the mashup becomes mishmash. From
  break dancing to the unashamed novelties of “the twist”, the film takes an
  anthropological approach to its melange of studies. The world is Brophy’s
  orifice, and he takes great pleasure in examining what’s inside. In both films
  he invites audiences into a splash zone, to experience what’s happening as
  opposed to simply viewing it. Whether gagging at the sight of vomit or tapping
  your foot to the beat, it’s an impulse that the maverick director invites.
  Like all deserving bodies of work, Brophy’s is being given a new life and,
  thanks to Miff, his films make a return to the place where it all started. As
  he confesses in Salt, Saliva, Sperm and Sweat: “You strive to have a presence
  in the world; to leave your mark upon it.” Like sweat patches and shit stains,
  the films of Philip Brophy certainly leave their mark. The Philip Brophy
  Restorations are showing at ACMI on 21 &amp; 22 August as part of Melbourne
  international film festival
