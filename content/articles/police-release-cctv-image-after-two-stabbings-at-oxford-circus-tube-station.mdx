  Police have released a CCTV image of a man they want to question after two
  people were stabbed at Oxford Circus tube station in London within 24 hours of
  each other over the weekend. Emergency services were called to two incidents
  in the early hours over the weekend, which police said were connected. The
  first incident took place at 3.40am on Saturday and the second just after
  1.30am on Sunday. A 23-year-old man injured on Saturday and a 43-year-old man
  were treated in hospital for stab wounds, British Transport Police (BTP) said.
  Police have not yet made any arrests. DCI Gareth Davies said: “There is
  absolutely no place for violence on the rail network, and detectives are
  working at pace to investigate these two connected incidents. “Passengers will
  see an increased police presence at the station while officers carry out their
  inquiries. We are urging anyone who was in the area at the time and may have
  seen these incidents take place or events leading up to, to get in touch and
  assist us with our inquiries. Any piece of information might be vital for our
  investigation.” Witnesses have been asked to text BTP on 61016 or call 0800
  405040. They can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
