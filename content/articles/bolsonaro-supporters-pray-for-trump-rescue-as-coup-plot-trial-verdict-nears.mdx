  Each morning, Edite Costa steps out of her bungalow on Brasília’s sun-baked
  savannah, stands beneath a mango tree and lifts her hands to the sky in
  prayer. “I ask God to work so that not just Trump but all Americans come to
  help us rip out the evil that has taken hold of the country I love,” said the
  66-year-old Baptist, who is a fervent supporter of Brazil’s far-right former
  president Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro could face decades in jail for allegedly
  leading a murderous conspiracy to seize power after his leftwing rival Luiz
  Inácio Lula da Silva beat him in the 2022 presidential election. But Costa
  believes her populist leader can still be saved – if her prayers are answered
  and Donald Trump intervenes. “I believe in God and I believe God will touch
  Donald Trump’s heart and that he will help us,” Costa proclaimed as she stood
  in her garden clutching the American flag she waves at pro-Bolsonaro rallies.
  “I’m convinced God has chosen him as a liberator,” she says of the US
  president. “And I believe God will empower him – and all Americans – so they
  come to love and liberate my land.” Costa is far from the only Bolsonarista
  pinning her hopes on a Trumpian intercession as the end of Bolsonaro’s trial
  nears. In the coming weeks, Brazil’s supreme court is widely expected to find
  Bolsonaro guilty of masterminding a coup plot, which would leave the
  70-year-old looking at up to 43 years behind bars. Friends and foes of the
  ex-president, who governed from 2019 to the end of 2022, are convinced the
  outcome is a foregone conclusion. “We’re almost certain the sentence has
  already been written [and] Bolsonaro will be jailed,” said Patrícia de
  Carvalho, 50, a pro-Bolsonaro businesswoman from Brazil’s capital who insists
  her leader is innocent. Guilherme Boulos, a leftwing congressman and close
  Lula ally, also believes Bolsonaro’s conviction and imprisonment is assured.
  “I’ve read the chief prosecutor’s 300-page report … the evidence is extremely
  robust,” Boulos said, pointing to a slew of incriminating material unearthed
  by federal police investigators. The evidence includes the discovery that an
  alleged plan to assassinate Lula and Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court
  judge presiding over the trial, was printed out in Bolsonaro’s presidential
  palace. “Any fair trial that considers this evidence will lead to Bolsonaro’s
  conviction for an attempted coup,” Boulos predicted. Costa, Carvalho and
  millions of other devotees now see only one possible lifeline for their
  movement’s leader: Trump heaping pressure on the supreme court and Lula’s
  government in an attempt to force judges to absolve him. In recent weeks the
  US president has started answering their calls, first by imposing 50% tariffs
  on Brazilian imports in retaliation against a supposed anti-Bolsonaro
  “witch-hunt”, then by stripping eight supreme court judges of their US visas,
  and finally by hitting Moraes with sanctions and accusing him of turning South
  America’s biggest democracy into “a judicial dictatorship”. At the centre of
  Trump’s pressure campaign is Bolsonaro’s third son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a
  congressman who has close ties to the Maga movement. Eduardo, 41, moved to the
  US in February claiming he was a victim of political persecution and has
  busied himself trying to persuade Trump officials to target Brazil. “[I visit
  the White House] almost every week,” he told the Brazilian newspaper O Globo
  this week, admitting he was lobbying the Trump administration to impose
  further sanctions after his father was placed under house arrest on Monday. He
  said he hoped for a reaction from the US. “What they’ll do, I don’t know,”
  added the hard-right politician, who named some of his US contacts as the
  Republican congresspeople María Elvira Salazar, Richard McCormick and Chris
  Smith, and Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon. With Bolsonaro’s day of
  judgment expected in September, his disciples are urging Trump’s
  administration to impose sanctions on other members of the 11-member supreme
  court in order to secure an acquittal. Last Sunday, Carvalho joined thousands
  of protesters outside Brasília’s central bank, carrying a banner urging Trump
  to make Brazil great again. Many marchers carried US flags or wore red Maga
  caps stamped with Trump’s name. Carvalho voiced confidence that the court
  would buckle under US pressure and drop the case. Experts disagree. They
  believe Trump’s sanctions and tariffs do not have a prayer of swaying the five
  judges who will decide Bolsonaro’s fate. What could Trump do to save
  Bolsonaro’s skin? “Invade Brazil,” quipped Thomas Traumann, a political pundit
  and the author of a book about his politically divided country called
  Biography of the Abyss. “There’s no chance at all of it happening.” Traumann
  said Trump’s pressure campaign had been Bolsonaro’s “last card” but it had
  failed, serving only to turn many of Brazil’s conservative elites against the
  ex-president for putting his own personal interests above those of his
  country. This week one industry federation warned that Trump’s tariffs could
  cost Brazil’s economy £3.5bn over the next two years. Traumann believed the
  chances of another member of the Bolsonaro clan winning next year’s
  presidential election and offering their patriarch a get-out-of-jail-free card
  had also taken a hit. Boulos also thought Trump’s ploy – which he called “a
  shameful, arrogant, imperialist affront” – had backfired on Bolsonarismo.
  “Even people on the right are looking at this and saying this can’t be
  possible … Brazil isn’t the US’s back yard, it isn’t a little banana republic
  where he can intervene and do whatever he wants.” Bolsonaro and his politician
  sons have long portrayed themselves as flag-waving patriots, encouraging
  followers to wear Brazil’s yellow-and-green football jersey and adopt the
  national anthem as their song. “But they have revealed themselves to be
  traitors to the nation who are being used by Trump to attack Brazilian
  sovereignty, Brazilian jobs and the Brazilian economy,” Boulos claimed. “If
  the objective was to save Bolsonaro, they’ve completely shot themselves in the
  foot.” Yet the Bolsonaristas have vowed to fight on. This week after Bolsonaro
  was confined to his mansion, fleets of cars and motorbikes honked their way
  through the streets of the capital in protest at his treatment. Pro-Bolsonaro
  congresspeople staged a 30-hour occupation of the lower house to demand an
  amnesty for the former president and for the rightwing activists who ransacked
  the same building during their 8 January 2023 rampage through Brasília. At one
  street protest, Costa, who admitted climbing on to the roof of congress during
  those pro-Bolsonaro riots, hoisted her stars-and-stripes flag into an azure
  sky and begged the US president to act. “Trumpy! Trumpy! Trumpy! Trumpy!” the
  throng around her chanted joyfully, using the Brazilian pronunciation of his
  name. “Trumpy! Come here to Brazil, Trumpy!” Costa bellowed back in English,
  imploring him to encircle Brazil with US military bases and colonise her
  homeland. “We love you!”
