  The price of the weight loss jab Mounjaro will rise by up to 170% in the UK,
  its US manufacturer has said, as Donald Trump ramps up pressure on drugmakers
  to increase their prices for Europeans so that they can make them more
  affordable for Americans. Eli Lilly has said it will increase the price of the
  drug from September, with a month’s supply of the highest dose rising from
  £122 to £330. Mounjaro contains tirzepatide and is self-administered in weekly
  injections. When it was launched in Britain in February 2024, Eli Lilly agreed
  to a list price “significantly below” its other European markets to stop
  delays in availability of the medicine through the NHS. The increase in the
  list price will align it “more consistently”, the company said, although it
  added that the NHS would not pay the new, higher price to ensure continued
  access for people with obesity and type 2 diabetes receiving it through the
  health service. Eli Lilly said it was working with private healthcare
  providers, which could negotiate their own confidential discounts with the
  company. Trump has threatened to use “every tool in our arsenal” to crack down
  on pharmaceutical companies charging higher prices in the US compared with
  other nations. The US pays about three times more for drugs compared with
  other developed countries, according to the Rand Corporation thinktank. On 31
  July, Trump sent letters to 17 of the world’s biggest drugmakers, including
  Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, demanding cuts to drug prices for Americans within
  60 days. “Make no mistake: a collaborative effort towards achieving global
  pricing parity would be the most effective path for companies, the government
  and American patients,” Trump wrote. “But if you refuse to step up we will
  deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued
  abusive drug pricing practices. “Americans are demanding lower drug prices,
  and they need them today.” In May, Trump told reporters that a friend in
  London had told him he had bought the “fat shot drug” for $88, compared with
  $1,300 in New York. Pharmaceutical companies have cashed in on huge demand for
  weight loss treatments. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk has become one of the most
  prominent names in the field, launching Wegovy in the UK in September 2023,
  which turned it into one of the most valuable companies in Europe. While the
  jabs have increased profits at big drugmakers, they are racing to develop an
  equivalent pill, which would be a more convenient and cheaper alternative for
  patients and healthcare authorities. Eli Lilly said this month that a pill in
  early trial stages showed that participants on their highest dose lost an
  average of 12.4% of their body weight, compared with 0.9% of the control
  group. Novo Nordisk has submitted its oral weight loss drug for approval in
  the US. Its trial results showed that participants could lose about 15% of
  their body weight.
