  Federal politicians have revealed ownership of gold bullion and race horses,
  overseas properties and some notable gifts, with members of the new parliament
  declaring a diverse range of interests, assets and living situations.
  Parliamentarians are obliged to give a full account of their financial and
  pecuniary interests upon election. The parliamentary register of interests
  always gives a great insight into the personal lives of our politicians (and
  occasionally uncovers a scandal). Months on from the May election, almost all
  of parliament has lodged their forms online. As the 48th parliament begins, we
  take you through some of the most notable items to come to light. Prized
  possessions The register asks MPs to declare ownership of assets valued at
  over $7,500. Many disclose ordinary possessions such as the family car – with
  homes and gifts disclosed in a separate section – but others have more unusual
  assets. Those close to the new shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, know
  she loves art and music, and the former professional musician has declared her
  saxophone. Several parliamentarians including Liberal MP Dan Tehan and Labor
  senator Helen Polley have declared part ownership of racehorses; Tehan has
  also declared “occasional earnings from racehorses”. Hunter MP and former
  Olympic shooter Dan Repacholi declared a racehorse in his interests in the
  47th parliament, but that has disappeared this time around. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Liberal MP Terry Young has declared sporting memorabilia
  that makes the threshold, as well as an undisclosed amount of gold bullion
  held in a self-managed super fund. The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, has
  meanwhile declared her spouse as the part-owner of a vintage car. Liberal MP
  Tony Wood has declared some antique furniture. Nationals MP turned independent
  Andrew Gee has declared a caravan (perhaps to be enjoyed more after his
  political career), along with a mention of “precious metals”. Hecs debts Just
  1.8% of the parliament’s 226 MPs and senators have declared a Hecs debt,
  compared with 11% of Australian adults. Labor’s newest Victorian MPs, Matt
  Greg, and Gabriel Ng, both of whom unseated Coalition members, have declared
  university debts; so has their Senate colleague, Charlotte Walker, the
  parliament’s youngest member at 21 years of age. Greens senator Steph
  Hodgins-May has also declared a Hecs debt. They might expect to benefit from
  the 20% one-off cut to their debts, passed through parliament last month.
  Shares and land Having been promoted to the assistant ministry, Andrew
  Charlton has had to let go of his entire share portfolio. With those shares
  previously controlled by a blind trust, we were on the lookout for how
  soonthey would be dropped after the promotion. Charlton has deleted all 25
  shareholdings in his portfolio from his register, while his partner has
  deleted all but two. One of the shares she continues to hold is the law
  chamber where she is also a director. Labor MP Sally Sitou, whom the
  Australian Financial Review previously named as one of the best stock pickers
  in parliament, declared cryptocurrency, in the form of Ripple shares as well
  as ownership of some gold bullion. While plenty of politicians have multiple
  properties, and even multiple investment properties, a handful also have
  properties overseas. Cabinet minister Tanya Plibersek, whose parents are
  Slovenian, owns an investment property in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Labor MP Sam
  Lim has declared a family home in Johor, Malaysia. Another Labor MP, South
  Australia’s Steve Georganas, has declared ownership of a block of residential
  land and a block of farm land containing an olive grove in Greece, both of
  which he inherited, while his wife owns an apartment in Athens. Liberal MP
  Andrew Wallace’s spouse owns an investment property which doubles as a holiday
  home in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, and has declared income from the
  property. A four-hour drive west of Vancouver, it’s in wine and orchard
  country. First Nations members Malarndirri McCarthy, Marion Scrymgour and
  Jacinta Nampijinpa Price have all listed land or land claims where they are
  traditional owners. McCarthy, the minister for Indigenous Australians, has
  declared herself a traditional owner in six land claims, while Scrymgour is a
  traditional land owner from the Miyartuwi Skin group on the Tiwi Islands.
  Liberal senator Nampijinpa Price is a traditional owner within the Janganpa
  Land Trust. Side hustles, hobbies and gifts Nampijinpa Price is also one of
  three politicians to declare earnings from sales of novels they’ve penned. She
  declared that earnings for her memoir, Matters of the Heart, are handled by a
  discretionary trust. Prolific writer (and runner) Andrew Leigh declared
  earnings from his many books, most of which are economics-related. Anne Aly,
  the first Muslim woman in cabinet and a former counter-terrorism expert,
  declared “lending rights from books previously authored”. Nationals senators
  Ross Cadell and Bridget McKenzie were both given copies of Scientology founder
  L Ron Hubbard’s book, The Way To Happiness, by the Canberra chapter of the Way
  To Happiness society. Speaking of societies: new Labor MP Rowan Holzberger has
  listed himself as the patron for the Australian Budgerigar Society and the
  Australian Native Orchid Society’s Beenleigh chapter. And back to McKenzie:
  the avid firearms enthusiast has declared her membership of several gun clubs
  including the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Field &amp; Game
  Australia, Deer Stalkers Club, Sporting Shooters Association of Australia and
  the Australian Deer Association. Other parliamentarians have declared diverse
  business interests. Rising Labor senator Jana Stewart has disclosed that she
  is the director of a fashion label startup, called Frankly Blak. New One
  Nation senator Tyron Whitten has declared his directorship of an investment
  vehicle known as the Hillbilly Oysters Family Trust. Liberal MP Scott Buchholz
  noted he is the director of a cattle company and a sole trader of a farming
  operation, and that his wife is an “Airbnb host”.
