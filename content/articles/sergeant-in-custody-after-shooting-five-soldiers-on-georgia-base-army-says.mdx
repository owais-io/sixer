  An active-duty soldier opened fire at Fort Stewart military base in south-east
  Georgia on Wednesday, wounding five other soldiers before being taken into
  custody. All victims are in stable condition and expected to recover. Three of
  the soldiers required surgery, and two were transferred to Memorial Health
  University medical center in Savannah, the top-level trauma center for coastal
  Georgia. Brig Gen John Lubas, commander of the third infantry division and
  Fort Stewart-Hunter army airfield, said at a press conference on Wednesday
  that the alleged shooter was 28-year-old Sgt Quornelius Radford, who was
  assigned to Fort Stewart. “The shooting occurred at the soldier’s place of
  work,” Lubas said. “It did involve his co-workers. We’re still not certain
  about the motivations, but again, he’s been interviewed by army investigators,
  and we believe we’ll gain more information here shortly.” Parts of the base
  had been locked down earlier on Wednesday after a shooter was reported on the
  sprawling army post, a spokesperson said. The base later issued an all-clear,
  and gates were reopened at Fort Stewart, Wright army airfield and Evans army
  airfield. Lubas said soldiers in the area who witnessed the shooting
  “immediately and without hesitation tackled the soldier, subdued him. That
  allowed law enforcement to then take him into custody.” The base said in a
  Facebook post that the shooting occurred in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat
  Team area. “All soldiers were treated on-site and moved to Winn Army Community
  Hospital for further treatment,” the base said. Lubas confirmed the shooter
  did not use a military weapon. “We believe it was a personal handgun,” he
  said. Located about 40 miles south-west of Savannah, Fort Stewart is the
  largest army post east of the Mississippi River. It is home to thousands of
  soldiers assigned to the army’s third infantry division and family members.
  Almost 9,000 people live on the huge Fort Stewart base, according to Military
  OneSource, a defense department program. Hinesville, the city outside the
  front gate in Liberty county, is estimated to have a population of about
  35,000 people indicating what a dominant influence the military base is in the
  area, and more than 18,000 military retirees live within a 50-mile radius. The
  sprawling army complex includes schools for service members’ families, and
  stores and recreational services across the area. Three schools nearby had
  also ordered a lockdown following the base shooting. The lockdown was lifted
  at around noon local time, shortly after it emerged that the shooter had been
  apprehended and was no longer considered a threat to the community. During a
  White House event, Donald Trump called the Fort Stewart shooting an “atrocity”
  and said the shooter would be “prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.
  “The entire nation is praying for the victims and their families, and
  hopefully they’ll fully recover,” Trump said. An FBI spokesperson said that
  their Savannah satellite office “is aware of the incident at Fort Stewart and
  is coordinating with Army Criminal Investigations Division for any assistance
  that might be needed”. The AP reports that Radford enlisted in January 2018.
  He worked as a supply sergeant and has not been deployed. Radford faced a 20
  August hearing in Hinesville, a small town near the base, on accusations of
  driving under the influence and running a red light just after 1am on 18 May,
  according to a citation and court filing. He was given a blood test and
  released on a $1,818 bond, records show. The homeland security secretary,
  Kristi Noem, said she had been briefed on the shooting and would be closely
  monitoring the situation. Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, posted on X saying
  he and his wife and daughters were saddened by the shooting. “We are keeping
  the victims, their families, and all those who answer the call to serve in our
  hearts and prayers, and we ask that Georgians everywhere do the same.” Senator
  Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, also posted an expression of
  sympathy in the wake of the shooting. “I’m heartbroken to see the news of an
  active shooter incident at Fort Stewart today,” Warnock said on Wednesday.
  “I’m monitoring the situation closely and join all of Georgia as we pray for
  the safety of our servicemembers, staff, and their families.” A previous
  shooting had taken place at Fort Stewart, when an army sergeant was killed in
  2022. Sgt Nathan Hillman, a 30-year-old from Pennsylvania, and an Afghan
  veteran, died during the shooting on 12 December 2022. Reuters and the
  Associated Press contributed reporting
