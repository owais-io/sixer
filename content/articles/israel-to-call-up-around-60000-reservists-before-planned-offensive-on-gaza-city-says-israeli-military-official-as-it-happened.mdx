  Israel will call up around 60,000 reservists before a planned offensive to
  take Gaza City but most forces that would operate in the Gaza Strip’s largest
  urban centre would be active duty soldiers, an Israeli military official said
  on Wednesday. The call-up notices could be sent in the coming days, with
  reservists to report for duty in September, the military official said. The
  mayor of the nearby Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, Guy Yifrach, confirmed
  that Israel has approved a major settlement project on Wednesday in an area of
  the occupied West Bank that the international community has warned threatens
  the viability of a future Palestinian state. Israel’s approval of a key
  settlement project in the West Bank undermines the chances of a two-state
  solution, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has said in a statement. The approval
  of the project in the area known as E1 “fragments… geographic and demographic
  unity, entrenching the division of the occupied West Bank into isolated areas
  and cantons that are disconnected from one another, turning them into
  something akin to real prisons,” the PA’s foreign ministry said in a
  statement. International aid groups say they have not yet been able to deliver
  shelter materials to Gaza despite Israeli authorities saying they have lifted
  restrictions on such supplies, and warn that further delays could cause more
  Palestinian deaths. Some 154 pallets of humanitarian aid have been airdropped
  in the Gaza Strip today, according to the IDF. Aircraft from Jordan, the
  United Arab Emirates, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Singapore and
  Indonesia dropped the pallets, containing several hundred kilograms of food,
  according to The Times of Israel. Israel is “killing all prospects” for peace
  in the Middle East, Jordan’s foreign minister has said amid escalating
  international outrage over Israel’s plans for a new large-scale offensive in
  Gaza City and plans to massively expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
  Ayman Safadi made his remarks during a visit to Moscow on the same day that
  the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, approved a plan to conquer Gaza
  City, an urban area home to hundreds of thousands of people in the north of
  the Palestinian territory. President Donald Trump’s administration on
  Wednesday imposed sanctions on two judges and two prosecutors at the
  International Criminal Court, as Washington kept up its pressure on the war
  tribunal over its targeting of Israeli leaders. Washington designated Nicolas
  Yann Guillou of France, Nazhat Shameem Khan of Fiji, Mame Mandiaye Niang of
  Senegal, and Kimberly Prost of Canada, according to the US Treasury and State
  Department, Reuters reported. A fire broke out near Iran’s Tabriz airport on
  Wednesday, with heavy smoke hanging in the city’s sky, Iran’s Fars news agency
  reported, adding operations to control the fire are ongoing. Syria’s foreign
  minister met Israel’s strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer in Paris on
  Tuesday to discuss security arrangements in southern Syria, two Syrian sources
  familiar with the meeting said. Syrian and Israeli officials have been
  conducting US-mediated talks on de-escalating conflict in southern Syria.
  French president Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that Israel’s “military
  offensive” to conquer Gaza City “can only lead to a complete disaster for both
  peoples,” after Israel’s defence minister authorised the call-up of around
  60,000 reservists. Israel’s plan “will drag the region into a permanent war,”
  the French president posted on social media, reiterating his call for an
  “international stabilisation mission”. Iran “cannot completely cut
  cooperation” with the UN nuclear watchdog but the return of its inspectors is
  up to the country’s security chiefs, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said
  Wednesday. The remarks come nearly two months after Iran suspended cooperation
  with the International Atomic Energy Agency following its 12-day war with
  Israel in June. Prime minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday that he
  treats leaders of other countries with respect after his Israeli counterpart
  Benjamin Netanyahu attacked him over his decision to recognise a Palestinian
  state. “I don’t take these things personally, I engage with people
  diplomatically. He has had similar things to say about other leaders,”
  Albanese said during a media briefing. A 58% majority of Americans believe
  that every country in the United Nations should recognise Palestine as a
  nation, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, as Israel and Hamas considered
  a possible truce in the nearly two-year-long war. 33% of respondents did not
  agree that UN members should recognise a Palestinian state and 9% did not
  answer. German prosecutors have charged a Russian national they suspect of
  planning an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin and of trying to join
  militant organisation Islamic State, they said on Wednesday. Prosecutors
  believe the accused, identified only as Akhmad E. in line with German privacy
  rules, obtained instructions from the Internet on how to make explosives but
  the plan failed as he could not get the components he needed. Some 154 pallets
  of humanitarian aid have been airdropped in the Gaza Strip today, according to
  the IDF. Aircraft from Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, the
  Netherlands, France, Singapore and Indonesia dropped the pallets, containing
  several hundred kilograms of food, according to The Times of Israel. President
  Donald Trump’s administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two judges and
  two prosecutors at the International Criminal Court, as Washington kept up its
  pressure on the war tribunal over its targeting of Israeli leaders. Washington
  designated Nicolas Yann Guillou of France, Nazhat Shameem Khan of Fiji, Mame
  Mandiaye Niang of Senegal, and Kimberly Prost of Canada, according to the US
  Treasury and State Department, Reuters reported. ICC judges issued arrest
  warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli defence
  chief Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leader Ibrahim al-Masri last November for
  alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza conflict.
  Guillou is an ICC judge who presided over a pre-trial panel that issued the
  arrest warrant for Netanyahu. Khan and Niang are the court’s two deputy
  prosecutors. The move comes less than three months after the administration
  took the unprecedented step of slapping sanctions on four separate ICC judges,
  saying they have engaged in ICC’s “illegitimate and baseless actions”
  targeting the US and close ally Israel. ICC, which had slammed the move in
  June, describing it as an attempt to undermine the independence of the
  judicial institution, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  Syria’s foreign minister met Israel’s strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer in
  Paris on Tuesday to discuss security arrangements in southern Syria, two
  Syrian sources familiar with the meeting said. Syrian and Israeli officials
  have been conducting US-mediated talks on de-escalating conflict in southern
  Syria. A previous round of these talks was held in Paris in late July but
  ended without a final accord. Syrian state news agency Sana said foreign
  minister Asaad al-Shibani met with an Israeli delegation on Tuesday, but did
  not mention Dermer. The agency said the discussions focused on de-escalation,
  non-interference in Syrian domestic affairs and reactivating a 1974
  disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria that created a UN buffer zone
  in the Golan Heights. There was no public comment by the Israeli government on
  the meeting, Reuters reported. Israel’s approval of a key settlement project
  in the West Bank undermines the chances of a two-state solution, the
  Palestinian Authority (PA) has said in a statement. The approval of the
  project in the area known as E1 “fragments… geographic and demographic unity,
  entrenching the division of the occupied West Bank into isolated areas and
  cantons that are disconnected from one another, turning them into something
  akin to real prisons,” the PA’s foreign ministry said in a statement. The
  approval of the E1 project, which would bisect the occupied West Bank and cut
  it off from East Jerusalem, was announced last week by sraeli finance minister
  Bezalel Smotrich and received final go-ahead from a defence ministry planning
  commission earlier today Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not
  commented on the E1 announcement. An Israeli tank manoeuvres on the Israeli
  side of the border with Gaza, Israel, today. Israel is “killing all prospects”
  for peace in the Middle East, Jordan’s foreign minister has said amid
  escalating international outrage over Israel’s plans for a new large-scale
  offensive in Gaza City and plans to massively expand Jewish settlements in the
  West Bank. Ayman Safadi made his remarks during a visit to Moscow on the same
  day that the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, approved a plan to conquer
  Gaza City, an urban area home to hundreds of thousands of people in the north
  of the Palestinian territory. Echoing the sentiment, Emmanuel Macron, the
  French president, said that the proposed new Gaza offensive would lead to
  “true disaster” and drag the region into “permanent war”. Katz’s announcement,
  which will lead to the mobilisation of an extra 60,000 Israeli troops, was
  also condemned by Germany, historically one of Israel’s closest allies in
  Europe, which said it “rejects the escalation” of Israel’s campaign in Gaza.
  French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that Israel’s “military
  offensive” to conquer Gaza City “can only lead to a complete disaster for both
  peoples,” after Israel’s defence minister authorised the call-up of around
  60,000 reservists. Israel’s plan “will drag the region into a permanent war,”
  the French president posted on social media, reiterating his call for an
  “international stabilisation mission”. International aid groups say they have
  not yet been able to deliver shelter materials to Gaza despite Israeli
  authorities saying they have lifted restrictions on such supplies, and warn
  that further delays could cause more Palestinian deaths. Aid organisations say
  Israel had in effect been blocking the delivery of materials for shelters for
  nearly six months, with tent poles previously listed among items Israeli
  authorities considered could have a military as well as civilian use. With
  international concern over the plight of Palestinians mounting as the war in
  Gaza continues, Israel announced measures last month to let more aid into Gaza
  and said on Saturday that it would start allowing shelter materials in from
  the next day. But officials from five aid groups, including UN agencies, told
  Reuters that shelter materials needed by large numbers of displaced
  Palestinians were still not reaching Gaza and blamed Israeli bureaucratic
  hurdles. “The United Nations and our partners have...not been able to bring in
  shelter materials following the Israeli announcement,” the UN Office for the
  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), spokesperson Jens Laerke said. On
  the ground in Gaza City on Wednesday, Mustafa Qazzaat, head of the emergency
  committee in the Gaza municipality, described the situation as “catastrophic”
  as Israel’s defence minister approved a plan on Wednesday for the conquest of
  Gaza City. He told AFP that “large numbers” of people were fleeing their
  neighbourhoods, with the majority of those displaced “on the roads and streets
  without shelter.” Aida Abu Madi, a 48-year-old resident of Zeitoun, said she
  fled on Wednesday with her husband, children and three grandchildren to the
  home of relatives in western Gaza City. “I didn’t hear about Israel’s
  decision, but I saw my neighbours fleeing, so I fled too,” she told AFP by
  telephone. Anis Daloul, 64, said he fled Zeitoun with his family on Sunday for
  a neighbourhood northwest of Gaza City. Jordan’s foreign minister said
  Wednesday that Israel’s assault on Gaza had caused “massacres and starvation”
  and that its wider actions were “killing all prospects” for peace in the
  Middle East. His comments came after Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz
  approved a plan to conquer Gaza City, an urban area home to hundreds of
  thousands of people in the north of the Palestinian territory. Most of the
  territory’s population has been displaced since the war began, many
  repeatedly, according to the United Nations. Addressing Russian counterpart
  Sergei Lavrov at a meeting in Moscow, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi
  said he hoped to discuss “efforts to end the aggression on Gaza, and the
  massacres and starvation that it is creating.” A fire broke out near Iran’s
  Tabriz airport on Wednesday, with heavy smoke hanging in the city’s sky,
  Iran’s Fars news agency reported, adding operations to control the fire are
  ongoing. Iran “cannot completely cut cooperation” with the UN nuclear watchdog
  but the return of its inspectors is up to the country’s security chiefs,
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Wednesday. The remarks come nearly two
  months after Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy
  Agency following its 12-day war with Israel in June. Iran has cited the IAEA’s
  failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities as the
  reason for its decision, which saw the watchdog’s inspectors leave the country
  following the passing of new legislation by parliament. “We cannot completely
  cut cooperation with the agency,” Araghchi said, noting that new fuel rods
  need to be installed at Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant in the coming weeks
  which will require the presence of IAEA inspectors. “Under the law passed by
  parliament, the return of inspectors will be possible through a decision of
  the Supreme National Security Council,” he told the official IRNA news agency
  in an interview published Wednesday, referring to Iran’s top security body.
  The mayor of the nearby Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, Guy Yifrach,
  confirmed that Israel has approved a major settlement project on Wednesday in
  an area of the occupied West Bank that the international community has warned
  threatens the viability of a future Palestinian state. “I am pleased to
  announce that just a short while ago, the civil administration approved the
  planning for the construction of the E1 neighbourhood,” Yifrach, said in a
  statement. Israel gave final approval on Wednesday for a controversial
  settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively cut the
  territory in two, and that Palestinians and rights groups say could destroy
  hopes for a future Palestinian state. Settlement development in E1, an open
  tract of land east of Jerusalem, has been under consideration for more than
  two decades, but was frozen due to U.S. pressure during previous
  administrations. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli
  settlement construction in the West Bank to be illegal and an obstacle to
  peace. Far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader,
  cast the approval as a rebuke to western countries that announced their plans
  to recognize a Palestinian state in recent weeks. “The Palestinian state is
  being erased from the table not with slogans but with actions,” he said on
  Wednesday. “Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is
  another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea.” Good afternoon, Israel
  will call up around 60,000 reservists before a planned offensive to take Gaza
  City but most forces that would operate in the Gaza Strip’s largest urban
  centre would be active duty soldiers, an Israeli military official said on
  Wednesday. The call-up notices could be sent in the coming days, with
  reservists to report for duty in September, the military official said. “Most
  of the troops that will be mobilised in this new stage will be active duty and
  not reservists,” said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of
  anonymity. It comes as Israel is studying Hamas’ response to a proposal for a
  60-day ceasefire and release of half the hostages still held in Gaza, two
  Israeli officials said on Tuesday, although one source reiterated that all
  Israeli captives must be freed for the war to end. Elsewhere: Prime minister
  Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday that he treats leaders of other countries
  with respect after his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu attacked him
  over his decision to recognise a Palestinian state. “I don’t take these things
  personally, I engage with people diplomatically. He has had similar things to
  say about other leaders,” Albanese said during a media briefing. A 58%
