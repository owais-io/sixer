  The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, has asked a local judge to consider
  jailing Beto O’Rourke, saying the former congressman was openly defying a
  judicial order blocking him and his political group from fundraising and
  paying the costs of Democrats who left the state to stop Republicans from
  passing a new congressional map. Tarrant county district judge Megan Fahey
  granted a request from Paxton last week halting O’Rourke and a group aligned
  with him, Powered by People, from fundraising. The order bars the group from
  using funds to pay the costs of Texas lawmakers during the special session or
  paying the $500 daily fines the lawmakers face for each time they are absent.
  In his Tuesday, filing, Paxton said O’Rourke had continued to fundraise after
  Fahey’s ruling, pointing to a post on X soliciting donations on ActBlue, a
  Democratic fundraising platform, and requests to donate during a rally in Fort
  Worth last week. Paxton requested O’Rourke be fined $500 for each instance in
  which he defied the court’s order and “be confined to jail unless and until he
  demonstrates a willingness to abide by the court’s orders pending the outcome
  of this lawsuit”. Powered by People did not immediately return a request for
  comment. In a filing in response to Paxton’s, O’Rourke’s lawyers said Paxton
  was “knowingly taking a statement entirely out of context to intentionally
  misrepresent the statement to this Court” and said they would seek sanctions
  against him, according to the Texas Tribune. The court’s order, they said,
  barred the group from fundraising for non-political purposes, not from
  fundraising altogether. “He’s lying about me to try to silence us,” O’Rourke
  said in a post on X on Tuesday. At the urging of Donald Trump, Republicans are
  seeking to pass a new map that would give them five additional seats in
  Congress. O’Rourke’s group has been one of the main funders for Texas
  Democrats as they have left the state for weeks to deny Republicans in the
  state legislature a quorum to conduct business. The Texas senate passed the
  new congressional map on Tuesday, but it will not earn full approval from the
  legislature because of the quorum-break. Lawmakers are set to adjourn on
  Friday and Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has said he will immediately convene
  a new special session. Many of the lawmakers are currently in Illinois, and
  Powered by People has been a leading funder in covering expenses, according to
  the Texas Tribune. Paxton and Abbott have been trying to ratchet up the
  pressure on them to return to Texas. Paxton has also launched an investigation
  into Powered by People. O’Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton in El
  Paso seeking to halt that investigation.
