  In Majuro, a day after fire ravaged the national parliament, the full
  devastation became clear. The building known as Nitijela had been reduced to a
  blackened shell, littered with debris. Among the objects lost to the fire were
  archive documents, original journal transcripts of daily sessions going back
  decades, and artworks that once adorned the walls. Flames had engulfed the
  building by the time the only functioning fire engine in the Marshall Islands
  arrived to fight the blaze on 26 August. Firefighters were joined by residents
  and government officials, furiously trying to extinguish the flames and
  salvage any hard drives storing digital documents, including a copy of the
  country’s constitution. Yet despite their efforts, the building could not be
  saved. Now the people of the Marshall Islands are confronting a loss of a
  landmark that holds deep cultural significance. “It was the heart of our
  democracy – a place where the Marshallese voice was heard, our sovereignty
  upheld, our future shaped,” says the minister of foreign affairs and trade,
  Kalani Kaneko. “The Marshall Islands has overcome many trials. This tragedy
  will not define us. Our collective response and resilience in the face of it
  will demonstrate our strength.” Clearing the parliament’s ruins is expected to
  begin almost immediately, according to local media, and the rebuild could take
  up to a year. President Hilda Heine said the “foundation of our democratic
  spirit and cultural strength remains firm and unshaken”. Located in central
  Majuro, the parliament was connected by a corridor to the former capitol
  complex, which had been slated for rebuilding. The complex had been unoccupied
  for more than 10 years until its demolition last spring. Both buildings were
  32 years old. Reconstruction of a new capitol complex will be delayed as the
  government works to first rebuild the parliament. Less than a week after the
  fire, a local construction firm brought heavy equipment for demolition to the
  site. Construction is expected to begin soon after clearing the ruins, and is
  aimed to be completed by August 2026. In the meantime, parliament will convene
  next door at the International Conference Centre. Kaneko says the cost of
  reconstruction is expected to reach millions of dollars but that what was lost
  cannot be measured in money. He calls the Nitijela the symbol of Marshallese
  democracy and “the space where the voice of our people shaped our nation’s
  journey”. The Pacific archipelago lies between Hawaii and Australia and has a
  population of 42,000, with about half in Majuro. It had previously been
  colonised by Spain, Germany, Japan and the US. The name Nitijela means “the
  coming together of those who know” and is based on a proverb once used to
  describe forums held by irooj (chiefs). “The building gave a platform for the
  people of the Marshall Islands to story their own issues and chart their own
  course as Marshallese … without filter by colonial powers,” says Desmond
  Doulatram, a social science instructor at the College of the Marshall Islands.
  When the Nitijela is in session, key votes, debates and public hearings are
  broadcast on national radio and livestreamed, connecting Marshallese
  communities around the world. Doulatram describes the Nitijela as a “symbol of
  a reciprocal relation between leaders and the people” where plans are
  developed and debated, and cultural memory and oral traditions preserved. What
  the Marshall Islands needs most now, Kaneko says, is “solidarity and support
  from our friends and partners”, including technical expertise, financial
  assistance, and guidance in design and preservation. Under a recently
  renegotiated compact of free association with the United States, the Marshall
  Islands may be eligible to receive disaster assistance from the Federal
  Emergency Management Agency. Fema, which the Trump administration has
  threatened with drastic cuts, did not respond to requests for comment. Kitlang
  Kabua, a senator representing Kwajalein Atoll, tells the Guardian: “Although
  our hearts are heavy … I believe that Nitijela is still alive and strong
  through the survival of our people. So long as we remain and exist, we will
  always have Nitijela. “We will build another Nitijela chamber that honours the
  legacy of our forefathers, our culture and the Marshallese of today and
  tomorrow.”
