  The Republican senator Marsha Blackburn announced on Wednesday she will run
  for governor of Tennessee. A staunch ally of Donald Trump who represents a
  state he carried by nearly 30 percentage points, Blackburn would become the
  first female governor in Tennessee’s history if she wins next year. The vocal
  abortion foe supported Trump’s baseless claims of fraud during the 2020
  election, and was considered one of the most conservative members of the House
  of Representatives during 16 years representing a district in middle
  Tennessee. “Trump is back, America is blessed, and Tennessee: better than
  ever,” Blackburn said in her campaign launch video, which opens with a shot of
  a clapping Trump and features several images of them together. “I love
  Tennessee. I believe in Tennesseans, and I’m ready to deliver the kind of
  conservative leadership that will ensure our state is America’s conservative
  leader for this generation and the next.” Echoing Trump’s rhetoric, she
  promised to “define our boys and girls the way God made them”, deport
  undocumented immigrants, “whether it takes planes, trains or starships”, and
  “deliver a world-class education for our children by empowering parents, not
  the deep state”. A former state senator, she was elected to the House in 2002,
  then became Tennessee’s first female US senator in 2018. She championed
  legislation to strip all abortion providers of federal funding, and was among
  the Republican senators who announced they would vote to oppose the
  certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, but changed her
  mind after the January 6 attack. Blackburn was last year challenged for
  re-election by the Democratic state representative Gloria Johnson, who was one
  of the “Tennessee Three” protesters in the state house. The senator was
  elected to a second term with 64% of the vote. If she wins the race for
  governor, Blackburn may be able to appoint a successor to her Senate seat. She
  faces Congressman John Rose in the Republican primary, though other candidates
  could emerge. Last week, NBC News reported the defense secretary, Pete
  Hegseth, was considering running for the office. Axios reports that Trump’s
  pollster Tony Fabrizio believes Blackburn will be the “clear frontrunner” in
  the race, with 82% of GOP primary voters viewing her favorably.
