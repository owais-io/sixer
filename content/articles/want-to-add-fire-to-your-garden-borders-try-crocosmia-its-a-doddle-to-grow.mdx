  As regular readers of this column may have noticed, I am no taxonomist. I’ve
  never quite got on board with Latin names, but have gardened long enough to
  grudgingly accept that they are quite useful. For all that common names can be
  poetic (love-in-a-mist), intriguing (bladder wrack) or plain entertaining
  (goat’s beard), they can lack specificity. I’m not here to get into the weeds
  of determining whether one naming system is superior, and I use both
  interchangeably, but it is true that some Latin names have a certain panache.
  Crocosmia is among them. Crocosmia (common name: coppertips, which sounds
  pleasingly like a jaunty 1950s nickname for a small, possibly naughty child)
  is a real doer in the garden at this time of year. It’s also not remotely shy,
  as you’ll know if you have it. It’s a doddle to grow, unfussy about soil and
  even tolerant of part-shade, so most of its custodians tend to find they have
  the opposite problem with Crocosmia in their growing space: with its tall,
  blade-like leaves, it can take over a plot. If you’re a fan of big, bold, hot
  colours, it should be in your planting list. Ol’ coppertips has hundreds of
  cultivars, but as its common name suggests, the vast majority of them are in
  hues of orange and red. At the more subtle end of things is C. pottsii
  ‘Culzean Pink’, which is a soft coral orange, with smaller flowers.
  Alternatively, you could go for the familiar C. ‘Lucifer’, which boasts
  scarlet flowers in July and August. If you want that level of punch in a
  tighter space or container, the more modest C. ‘Hellfire’ has bright-red
  flowers squeezed on to a smaller plant, and tends to be less invasive. There
  are also yolky yellow versions: ‘Citrone Spray’, which will bloom later into
  September, or ‘Columbus’. Personally, I’ve never been able to accommodate one
  in my own small garden; the colour palette here is a tight pink, white and
  yellow situation. But when I think of Crocosmia I think of the garden that
  changed my mind on this plant, which belonged to a late friend and fantastic
  gardener. She planted it alongside plume poppies (Macleaya cordata), across a
  wide, deep bed. Everything had enough space, and the arching red sprays of the
  Crocosmia complemented the soft waft of the poppies’ beautiful fig-leaf
  foliage. After a summer storm it stood proud, beaded with rainwater. Heaven.
  With that in mind, I’d advise that you give Crocosmia its due and give it
  space. That could be dedicating one massive pot to a few corms (plant them in
  spring if you don’t want to pick them up as plants from a nursery now), or
  giving over a lot of a flowerbed. When else do you get the opportunity to let
  hellfire break loose in the garden?
