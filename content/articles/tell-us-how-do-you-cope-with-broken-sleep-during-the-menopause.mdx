  Insomnia and disrupted nights are among the most common, and one of the
  hardest, symptoms of the menopause. Hormonal changes can make it harder to
  fall asleep, cause frequent waking, or trigger night sweats that disturb rest.
  We’d like to hear about what has (or hasn’t) helped you manage these
  challenges. Have you sought medical support, such as a prescription for
  melatonin or HRT? Have lifestyle changes like exercise, diet, or relaxation
  techniques made a difference? Or perhaps you’ve tried alternative remedies or
  found creative ways of coping with broken sleep. We’re especially interested
  in the practical steps you’ve taken – big or small – and how they’ve affected
  your day-to-day life. If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read
  terms of service here and privacy policy here.
