  French screen and stage legend Isabelle Huppert will bring her acclaimed
  performance as Mary Stuart, AKA Mary, Queen of Scots, to Australia in March as
  part of an exclusive season for the 2026 Adelaide festival. Mary Said What She
  Said, a one-woman show created by late theatre luminary Robert Wilson for
  Théâtre de la Ville in Paris where it premiered in 2019, stars Huppert as the
  ill-fated monarch and devout Catholic whose dispute over the English throne
  with her Protestant cousin Queen Elizabeth I cost her her life. The play,
  written by novelist Darryl Pinckney, is set in the lead-up to Mary’s execution
  for treason in 1587 after 19 years in captivity and draws on Stuart’s letters
  to craft a “testimony” against accusations that she plotted, among other
  things, to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. Reviewing the show’s UK premiere in
  2024, the Guardian critic Claire Armitstead described Huppert’s performance as
  “astounding”. “Alone on stage for 90 minutes, she performs something between a
  rite and an elaborate courtly dance, her stylised, repetitive movements and
  moments of stillness accompanied by Pinckney’s poetic script casting a spell
  over her audience,” Armitstead wrote. Huppert has described the role as
  physically demanding: “I’m alone, but I’m not lonely because I am mentally,
  emotionally and spiritually very much surrounded, you know, because of all
  these people I am talking to. Plus, I have so much to do – the dancing, the
  different levels of voices. It keeps me very busy,” she said last year.
  Huppert is perhaps best known for her screen collaborations with Austrian
  auteur Michael Haneke, including 2001’s The Piano Teacher, for which she won
  the best actress award at Cannes. More recently, she appeared in the
  Oscar-nominated comedy Mrs Harris Goes to Paris. Wilson, a Texas-born theatre
  maker and visual artist, made his name with strikingly designed,
  non-naturalistic stage works, from his breakthrough 1976 production of the
  Philip Glass opera Einstein on the Beach to his monologue take on Hamlet and
  the opera The Black Rider: The Casting of the Magic Bullets, conceived with
  singer-songwriter Tom Waits and author William S Burroughs. He died on 31 July
  at the age of 83. Mary Said What She Said is Huppert’s third and last stage
  collaboration with Wilson, who she described as “a genius, one of the great,
  great theatre inventors of our century”. Mary Said What She Said will headline
  Adelaide festival alongside performances by the French choir and orchestra
  Ensemble Pygmalion. The full program will be announced on 27 October. Adelaide
  festival will run 27 February to 15 March 2026.
