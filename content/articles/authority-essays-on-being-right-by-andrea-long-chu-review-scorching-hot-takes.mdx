  Andrea Long Chu stands accused of not playing by the rules, of appraising
  works of fiction as if they were essays or confessions rather than aesthetic
  objects. “It is true that I tend to treat a novel like an argument”, she
  writes in the introduction to Authority, a collection of essays and reviews
  published between 2018 and 2023 in outlets such as N+1, Bookforum and New York
  Magazine. Chu – who won a Pulitzer prize for criticism in 2023 – believes “all
  novels refract the veiled subjectivity of their authors”, and to pretend
  otherwise is to indulge a “pernicious form of commodity fetishism”. In her
  reviews, books betray their authors, invariably revealing some kernel of
  inadequacy – be it immaturity, myopia or just terminal dullness. This approach
  borders on the psychoanalytical, and makes for fun reading. Chu diagnoses a
  case of “Munchausen by proxy” in Hanya Yanagihara, whose bestselling novels A
  Little Life (2015) and To Paradise (2022) are powered by “the misery
  principle”: “horrible things happen to people for no reason”, and the author
  is “a sinister kind of caretaker, poisoning her characters in order to nurse
  them lovingly back to health”. She notes a troubling tendency towards
  “infantile” idealisation of mothers and girlfriends in Tao Lin’s autofiction,
  and finds “something deeply juvenile” about the scatological motifs in Ottessa
  Moshfegh’s novels. Moshfegh’s medieval gore-fest Lapovona (2022), fails to
  shock, because “You cannot épater le bourgeois without an actual bourgeoisie”;
  “the leading coprophile of American letters” is trying too hard to convince us
  she’s not a prude. Reviewing Bret Easton Ellis’s “deeply needless” 2019 essay
  collection, White (“less a series of glorified, padded-out blog posts than a
  series of regular, normal-size blog posts”), Chu bemoans his descent into
  fogeyish paranoia, and suggests the author of American Psycho is starting to
  resemble his most famous creation. “At some point,” she quips, “one must ask
  if a man who sees Nineteen Eighty-Four all around him is really just stuck in
  the 80s.” A takedown of Curtis Sittenfeld’s 2020 novel, Rodham, which imagines
  an alternative universe where Hillary Clinton never married Bill, is a
  withering indictment of hollow girl-boss feminism: this is “an unpolitical
  book by an unpolitical author about … an unpolitical person”; Sittenfeld’s
  complacency mirrors that of her protagonist, a woman whose “true talent lies
  in persuading college-educated people that her ambition, and by extension
  theirs, is a genuine expression of competence”. A recurring figure in these
  essays is the successful author with a gripe about oversensitive lefty
  youngsters and social media mobs. These include Ellis, Moshfegh, Maggie Nelson
  – whose complaints about art-world censoriousness in On Freedom are dismissed
  with a huffily italicised “boring” – and Zadie Smith, whose “habit of
  sympathizing with the least sympathetic party in any given situation
  frequently drives her to the political center”. Chu provocatively suggests
  this tendency is a bit of an act, compensating for Smith’s failure to produce
  a touchstone work of social realism: since Smith has “never actually excelled
  at constructing the kind of sympathetic, all-too-human characters she
  advocates for”, she makes up for it with a lofty bothsidesism she thinks
  becoming of a serious, above-the-fray liberal humanist. Chu is similarly
  unsparing in her critique of the publishing industry’s patronising and
  counterproductive tendency to over-hype minority voices in order to atone for
  past wrongs. (“This is to respond to pigeonholing by overstating the value of
  being a pigeon.”) In a refreshingly clear-sighted essay on Asian American
  fiction, she questions whether the experiences depicted in a glut of diaspora
  novels have anything significant in common beyond their “diffident, aimless,
  frustrated” protagonists and a vague melancholy; the much-laboured theme of
  identity manifests as little more than “a sensation, a mild, chronic
  homesickness”, and “the acute experience of racial indeterminacy has diffused
  into something more banal”. Alongside the literary essays, Authority features
  dissections of TV shows and video games, and a wryly funny meditation on
  Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical shortcomings. (His winning strategy as a
  composer is “not to persuade but to overwhelm”.) There are also several
  personal pieces including an essay on vaginoplasty, a fictionalised account of
  undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (a treatment for depression), and
  On Liking Women, a widely shared 2018 essay about the author’s gender
  transition that kickstarted her writing career. Here Chu draws a connecting
  line between the gender separatist ideology of 1970s political lesbianism and
  today’s anti-trans activists, whom she accuses of laundering “garden-variety
  moral disgust”. In another era, such personal material would have sat uneasily
  in a volume of criticism, and it says something about our cultural moment that
  it doesn’t seem particularly out of place here. As Chu observes in the title
  essay, the subjectivity of the critic is an increasingly visible presence
  these days. Tracing the vexed debates around critical authority from the 18th
  century to the present day, she concludes that the concept has always been “an
  incoherent, inconsistent, and altogether empty thing”. The job of today’s
  critic is not so much to impart expertise but to become a storyteller in their
  own right: “The critic has become a witness, one whose job is to offer up an
  event within her own experience in such a way that the reader, if she is so
  inclined, may experience it too.” This checks out. Though Chu’s writing style
  is not as overtly chummy as that of her fellow US critic Lauren Oyler, it has
  a similarly disarming first-person candour, offsetting stridency with spasms
  of self-effacing humility, and the sort of tentative qualifications more
  commonly encountered in spoken discourse than on the printed page. (“Perhaps I
  am being ungenerous”; “What I mean is that …”; “My point is that …”; “I do not
  mean …”; “If it sounds like I’m saying … I suppose I am.”) These tics can be a
  bit cloying, and the occasional adolescent turns of phrase feel jarringly
  regressive: Chu uses “boring” an awful lot; at one point, she introduces a
  particularly unimpressive quote with “The following is an actual sentence.” In
  a postscript to one of the greener pieces in this volume, Chu, who is in her
  early 30s, winces at the prose style deployed by her younger self – “that kind
  of bloggy ‘voiceyness’ was dated even then”. Her anxiety on this score is
  symptomatic of a generational dilemma for a cohort of American writers who,
  having been raised to distrust authority – not just as a concept but perhaps
  especially as a register – and steeped in the highly self-conscious patter of
  online communities, must now work out how to be publicly clever in a
  non-overbearing way. In an anti-intellectual media landscape, one way to make
  yourself legible is to make yourself small. This is the striking thing about
  Chu’s authorial tone: she combines the expert and the naif in a single voice,
  which chimes with a similar dualism in her reader. These essays are
  essentially journeys – knotty and meandering, with moments of pithy,
  clarifying insight. If you can hold someone’s interest while figuring things
  out for yourself in real time on the page, you’re doing something right.
  Perhaps the true source of authority is companionable intelligence, and what
  we think of as sound judgment is just a function of familiarity – comfort in
  another person’s psychic skin. • Authority: Essays on Being Right by Andrea
  Long Chu is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£20). To support the Guardian,
