  2010s EDM

  In case the title of Ninajirachi’s debut album didn’t make it clear, the
  Australian producer spells out her love for all things electronica on its
  turbo third track: “I wanna fuck my computer / Cuz no one in the world knows
  me better.” A glitched-out cacophony of bleeps, mechanical spirals and sirens,
  the track – titled, descriptively, Fuck My Computer – is a firework display of
  raw energy and excitement. That freneticism rarely lets up across I Love My
  Computer, an immensely fun and inventive dance album that doubles as a
  surprisingly touching coming-of-age story from one of Australia’s minted
  electronic exports. After first gaining prominence as a Triple J Unearthed
  High finalist in 2016 and 2017, Ninajirachi – real name Nina Wilson –
  established herself at the forefront of Australia’s then burgeoning hyperpop
  community. But as the genre’s saccharine synths, irreverent samples and
  pitched-up vocals went increasingly mainstream post-2020, Wilson expanded her
  sound further. She released a cerebral 2022 mixtape, Second Nature, and played
  a series of slots at major US festivals including Lollapalooza and Las Vegas’s
  Electric Daisy Carnival. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The
  now 25-year-old producer has started identifying her genre as “girl EDM” – a
  tongue-in-cheek nod to the 2010s electronica she first fell in love with as a
  teenager online. Across the album’s dozen tracks, Ninajirachi pays tribute to
  that nascent period. Repeatedly, music reaches out in a language only she can
  hear: on Fuck My Computer, “it says my name”. And CSIRAC, a throbbing track
  named after the first computer to play music (an Australian invention,
  incidentally), feels like a deranged, borderline inscrutable trip into
  Wilson’s laptop. Across three minutes, the track jumps from chipmunk vocals to
  squelching acid-house breaks, metallic drones and pixelated breakbeats, as
  well as an eerie spoken-word bridge about following a sound. Which is exactly
  what the track is doing, racing through Wilson’s computer at breakneck speed
  and transcribing its bleeps and bloops. But you don’t need to overthink I Love
  My Computer to grasp the sincere depth of feeling Wilson has for her tech. In
  iPod Touch, another album highlight, Wilson links her music player to a flood
  of teenage memories. “It sounds like high school, front gate, smoke in my face
  / It sounds like iPod Touch / yellow Pikachu case,” she sings, her sugar-rush
  delivery thrashed against a frantic beat. Not to will another reboot into
  existence, but it’d make a great theme for a gen Z take on Puberty Blues.
  Here, images of archetypal Australian teenage rebellion (including wearing
  tiny Supré shorts) are just as nostalgic as memories of “me and my computer
  hanging out till late”, blasting a bass-boosted Porter Robinson song and
  trying out free music production software. Even with its 2015-specific
  imagery, iPod Touch encapsulates something universal. It sounds like the
  giddiness of adolescent discovery, where a song or artwork can cut through the
  confusion and awaken something so personal that you have no choice but to make
  it your entire personality. You might scoff at Wilson’s awakening through EDM
  – arguably the defining sound of the previous decade thanks to the likes of
  Calvin Harris, David Guetta and Diplo. But I Love My Computer proves how much
  juice the genre has, especially stripped of its noxious frat bro connotations.
  Wilson readily embraces steady builds, squelchy drops and a relentless BPM
  rarely below 120. I Love My Computer isn’t all euphoria, either. Delete is a
  twinkling ode to embarrassing Instagram stories, while Battery Death is a
  burnout lament built over dystopic error-synths. And on eurotrance track
  Infohazard, Wilson recalls stumbling upon a photo of a decapitated man on her
  computer as a teen. Led by a piano, it’s one of the few times a non-digital
  instrument is easily identifiable on the album – offering a strange sense of
  warmth to the confused, confronting memory. Indebted to electronic pioneer
  Sophie, Wilson has never been focused on real-life restrictions, more
  interested in what she can create than replicate. With her debut album,
  Ninajirachi charts a long-term (and fruitful) relationship with her computer.
  It’s very fun and surprisingly moving. I Love My Computer by Ninajirachi is
