  So far, South Park’s 27th season has had one clear goal: to provoke Donald
  Trump into a tantrum. Every episode has managed to pick on a new and different
  facet of his authoritarian rule – the silencing of his media critics, his use
  of Ice agents as an intimidation tactic – while simultaneously telling
  everyone what a tiny penis he has. So the anticipation levels were off the
  charts for this week’s episode, entitled Wok Is Dead, which promised to take
  on Trump’s tariff policy. And in fairness it did do this, but only in a couple
  of scenes where a Chinese character with an uncomfortably Mickey Rooney-esque
  accent complained about them. The rest of the episode just settled for a bunch
  of jokes about Labubu dolls, as well as calling Donald Trump “Satan” as many
  times as it feasibly could. For the most part, Wok Is Dead found itself split
  in two. The bulk of the episode was taken up with a very traditional South
  Park storyline about a cultural fad pushed to extremes. Everyone at South Park
  Elementary has become obsessed with Labubu dolls, a line of vaguely creepy
  collectible plush dolls sold in mystery boxes. In real life, the Labubu craze
  has been ramped up to the level of fidget spinners and loom bands before them,
  prompting the market to be flooded with a rush of carelessly manufactured
  fakes that potentially pose a danger to children. In the world of South Park,
  however, the dolls prompt satanic rituals, with children sacrificing poultry
  and summoning plagues in their desire to find ever-rarer dolls, much to the
  dismay of Jesus, who is serving as the school counsellor. And that’s about it
  for that particular storyline. It’s South Park by numbers: find something
  newly popular, mock it for 20 minutes, and then go home. But that isn’t why
  people have been watching South Park in record numbers this year. No, they’re
  doing that because of how nakedly aggressive the show has been towards Trump.
  And this week it chose to achieve this by having as many characters as
  possible repeat the line: “Donald Trump is fucking Satan.” This is for two
  reasons. First, throughout the season it has been evident that the cartoon
  Donald Trump has literally been having sexual intercourse with the devil, who
  makes a reappearance after his dalliance with Saddam Hussein in the South Park
  movie. Second, maybe the writers just wanted to call Trump “Satan” a bunch of
  times. In essence, this was South Park pulling the same trick it did with its
  controversial 2005 episode Trapped in the Closet, in which Tom Cruise locked
  himself inside a cupboard while everyone around him repeatedly stated: “Tom
  Cruise won’t come out of the closet.” On one hand, Tom Cruise was literally
  inside a closet. On the other, it was winking at unproven rumours about his
  sexuality. However, Trapped in the Closet had a grander aim, which was to
  describe the opaque beliefs of Scientologists. And it worked. Not only was it
  one of the best episodes of South Park ever made, but it changed the way the
  world talks about Scientology. Meanwhile, the aim of Wok Is Dead (aside from
  showing its disdain for Labubu dolls) seems to be to call Donald Trump Satan.
  Which, compared with the anger and specificity of the episodes preceding it,
  feels a little lazy. From everything we know about Trump, it feels like the
  jabs that land the hardest are the ones that undermine his ego, which is why
  he expends so much effort responding to claims about the size of his hands.
  Meanwhile, comparing him to Satan – the all-powerful embodiment of evil –
  feels as if it might actually be taken as a compliment. Still, the payoff to
  everybody saying “Donald Trump is fucking Satan” so often is that Satan is now
  pregnant with Donald Trump’s butt baby, which is bound to play out in future
  episodes somehow. If you’re a fan of South Park, then Wok Is Dead’s
  scattershot cultural satire will have more than passed muster. But for those
  of us who have been tuning in to watch Trey Parker and Matt Stone take down
  Trump, it represents the first disappointment of the season. Perhaps it’s a
  blip, but this week’s episode suggests that Parker and Stone are starting to
  run low on ammunition, and want to broaden their horizons away from Trump in
  future episodes. Still, if that’s the case, the outcome would be a regular
  South Park season, and there are many worse things than that. • South Park is
