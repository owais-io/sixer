  As Israel pushes ahead with its expanded military offensive in Gaza to
  devastating effect, closer to home, dissent is growing. On Saturday, thousands
  of people gathered in Habima Square in central Tel Aviv to demand an end to
  the war – one of the largest rallies since the fighting broke out. Israeli
  police revoked a prior permit for a march through the city, in a clear attempt
  to silence our voices of opposition – but we refused to let them succeed. It
  had been 24 hours since the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification
  (IPC) declared a famine in Gaza and revealed the horrors of Israel’s
  full-scale starvation campaign. Many Israelis felt it was our duty to rally in
  the streets. Since the cabinet resolution to reoccupy Gaza City, the Israeli
  military has issued 60,000 new recruitment warrants for reserve service. When
  the warrants come into effect in early September, the reserve forces will be
  at their highest level since the outbreak of the war – 130,000. But the
  military is not the only thing increasing in size. So, too, is the refusal
  movement. In recent weeks, a surge of refusers emerged in response to the
  political cynicism of Benjamin Netanyahu. In private talks between family
  members or in public declarations of objection, more and more Israelis are
  realising that participating in military service is to be complicit with the
  government’s crimes. The movement is not homogenous – either in age and social
  grouping, or in motive or ideology. Some conscientious objectors, like the
  teenagers of Mesarvot, go public with their refusal to be part of the war
  machine. They are treated with extreme severity and often subjected to cycles
  of imprisonment in military jail. I have personally conducted regulatory
  visits at such facilities, meeting these brave people who have come to be
  known as “soldiers of peace”. Others are less willing to publicise their
  stance, but privately refuse to serve. The data on the exact number of “grey
  refusers” is treated as a top intelligence secret and is not shared by the
  military, but Yesh Gvul, an organisation that assists those called up to
  obtain draft exemptions, says their number is constantly increasing. A recent
  poll published in Haaretz showed a striking increase in public support for
  those refusing to be drafted – about 33% of Jewish Israelis believe it is not
  only justified, but necessary, to save the hostages from the dangers of the
  military campaign in Gaza City. Motives for refusal range from resisting the
  genocide, moral objections to participating in war crimes, political
  opposition to the occupation at large and concern that military action
  endangers the hostages to disapproval of the ultra-Orthodox community’s
  exemption from service. Ella Keidar Greenberg, a conscientious objector who
  spoke at Saturday’s rally after being held in solitary confinement throughout
  April, said that by refusing she was able to obstruct the continuing
  destruction. While they are still speaking from a marginal position, it is
  clear that more and more Israelis wish to frustrate the government. In recent
  months, more demonstrations, vigils and direct action against Netanyahu’s war
  have been taking place. United by the basic notion of humanity, thousands of
  Arabs and Jews joined one another on Saturday to protest against the
  starvation, slaughter and carnage. Protesters held up pictures of the starved
  and bombed children of Gaza, knowing that the culprit responsible for their
  torment is still in power. We urged the release of all hostages and unlawful
  captives – Israelis and Palestinians alike – in a political agreement that
  would see the Israeli government pulling all military forces out of Gaza. But
  in the wake of news of another round of bombardments in Gaza, our message from
  the rally is best understood from the banner: “Never again”. Never again will
  we allow silence to prevail in the face of slaughtered children and starved
  families. Never again will we look on quietly as Netanyahu orders the
  destruction of neighbourhoods and the invasion of hospitals. Never again will
  we let his government refuse an agreement that will release the hostages.
  Never again will the Gaza genocide unfold quietly. As the descendant of a
  Jewish family from Poland, the words “never again” have significant meaning
  for me. In the aftermath of the second world war, humankind vowed to never
  again allow such atrocities to occur. The Holocaust, the mass extermination of
  the Jewish people, plumbed the very depths of tyrannical evil. Precisely
  because of this heritage, I view “never again” as a universal imperative. In
  1948, the international community adopted the universal declaration of human
  rights and the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of
  genocide. In the decades since, we have failed globally many times to
  safeguard this invaluable truth: that people must not perish in flames, and
  such heinous crimes must not be perpetrated while outsiders stand idly by. But
  never in recent times have people around the world stared into the abyss of
  annihilation as we are doing today in Gaza. As such, “never again” is not
  merely a moral reminder but an ethical decree to act. Fool me once, shame on
  you, fool me twice, shame on me, as the saying goes. It seems that Netanyahu
  manages to fool western leaders time and time again. On Friday, in response to
  the IPC declaration of famine, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said it
  was an “utterly horrifying and wholly preventable man-made catastrophe”. May I
  ask Lammy and the rest of the British cabinet – are you among the people
  responsible for this catastrophe? In July, the UK prime minister, Keir
  Starmer, announced a conditional plan to recognise a Palestinian state if
  Israel did not change course. Starving people who are under constant threat of
  bombardment do not enjoy the same patience as suited officials in marble
  offices. They plead for food, water and air while politicians debate
  conditions and timing. Starmer must immediately recognise Palestine
  unconditionally, but he must recognise much more than that. He must
  acknowledge Netanyahu as the international war criminal that he is. He must
  support new sanctions to tackle the settler movement, including ministers such
  as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. He must recognise that Netanyahu and
  his government are the main obstacle to releasing the hostages. He must
  recognise the people of Gaza as victims of a continuing genocide, and act
  accordingly. Or he will remain complicit in this devastating, human-made
  catastrophe. Dr Ofer Cassif is a member of the Knesset, representing the
  Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash) since 2019 Do you have an
