  A woman was arrested by police, who sent a riot van to her door at dawn, after
  she posted about her ex-partner, a serving Metropolitan police officer, on
  Facebook. Sarah* had been alerted by a friend to a post about her former
  partner that had been made in a local Facebook group linked to “Are we dating
  the same guy?”. The group is part of a global network of similar Facebook
  pages used by women to seek information about their partners, and warn others
  of “red flags” from men they have dated. Sarah commented on the original post,
  saying she and her ex-boyfriend were together for almost five years, “and then
  he cheated on me and gaslit me saying I was wrong”. She then made her own post
  in the group, warning other women about her ex-partner. “I was basically just
  saying that I just want to warn other women,” she said. Through the group, she
  said, she found out more information about her ex-partner’s behaviour while
  they were together, and sent him two messages. In one she called him a
  “pussy”, and then blocked his number. “I messaged him and just basically said,
  the audacity of you to blame me for the breakdown of our relationship,” she
  said. “I thought nothing of it until 13 May, when I got a knock on my door,
  well, banging on my door, at 4.45 in the morning.” Sarah opened the door to
  three police officers, who told her they were there to arrest her for alleged
  harassment. “I knew instantly that it was him,” she said. “They took me in,
  they took my phone, they took my computer, they put me in the back of a van,”
  she added. She spent about 12 hours in custody, where she was questioned about
  the messages and Facebook posts. During questioning, Sarah said, she did not
  dispute any of the evidence police officers put before her. “I’ve got nothing
  to hide. I’m not ashamed of what I’ve done. I’m doing it to protect women, and
  if I can just save one woman going through what I’ve gone through, then I’ve
  done something,” she said. She said police asked her if it was true she had
  called her ex “a pussy”. “I was like, yeah, you can’t arrest me for calling
  someone a pussy, that’s ridiculous.” After questioning, she was released
  without charge. The duty solicitor, Sarah said, told her that in his opinion,
  “this wouldn’t have happened if [her ex] wasn’t a police officer”. After her
  release, a police officer came to Sarah’s house and served her with civil
  court papers, with her ex-partner seeking a non-molestation order. The court
  rejected his application, expressing concern about “the applicant’s abuse of
  power in respect of the respondent being arrested at 4.45am by three police
  officers and a riot van attending the respondent’s property, [and] the
  applicant’s request for a detective to personally serve the respondent”.
  Dismissing his application, court papers said it “related to one Facebook post
  on 6 May 2024 and no other allegations had been raised by the applicant in
  support of a non-molestation order”. Sarah made a formal complaint, claiming
  her former partner had abused his position as a police officer by seeking her
  arrest, but this was rejected after nine months. As part of the investigation,
  her ex-partner said he had reported her behaviour because she posted details
  of the police station he worked at. In a letter, an inspector told Sarah that
  “the service provided [was] acceptable”, and “I do not consider unsatisfactory
  performance procedures are appropriate in respect of any officers.”
  “Financially, if I had all the money in the world, I would push and push and
  push to take this further with lawyers behind our backs,” Sarah said. “But
  unfortunately, we don’t have the financing to do that.” She said the
  experience had “changed her whole life”, and that she sometimes had panic
  attacks when she saw police officers in the street. “I’m struggling to go out
  and just enjoy myself for the fear that he’s going to be there and he’s going
  to think that I’m following him,” she added. A Metropolitan police
  spokesperson said: “In May 2024 officers arrested a 39-year-old woman on
  suspicion of harassment. After an interview under caution, she was released
  without further action. “Subsequently, allegations were made relating to an
  abuse of power by a serving Met officer. These were formally investigated and
  found to be unsubstantiated. “The action taken in this case was considered to
  be necessary, proportionate and compliant with the Police and Criminal
  Evidence Act as officers need to conduct prompt and effective investigations.”
