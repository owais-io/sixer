  There is some swirling uncertainty surrounding the future of Ollie Watkins, so
  Aston Villa are taking precautions. They have got on to the blower to Porto to
  ask how much Samu Aghehowa would cost. André Villas-Boas, who is now the club
  president, wants £55m for him, which is a big chunk of change but the
  20-year-old did score 19 in 30 appearances last season and is a fully-fledged
  Spain international. Speaking of Spanish strikers potentially on the move,
  Sunderland are in talks with Chelsea to sign one of their many reserves. The
  Black Cats want Marc Guiu, who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Barcelona just
  over a year ago. His first season in England resulted in only three Premier
  League appearances and it comes as no surprise, after the signing of Liam
  Delap, that he might need to move elsewhere to get more time on the pitch. At
  the other end of the pitch, Sunderland are closing on Robin Roefs, who will
  cost an initial £9m from NEC. One player not leaving the Stadium of Light this
  week is Nectarios Triantis after a £1.2m bid from Derby was rejected for the
  midfielder. It turns out that MLS is not all about signing hasbeens on free
  transfers anymore. Atlanta United made a £30m bid for the Crystal Palace
  striker Jean-Philippe Mateta but the Eagles rejected it out of hand. The
  Londoners are not interested in selling their main man, forcing the Americans
  to turn their attentions to Rodrigo Muniz. After a mixed bag of a season at
  Nottingham Forest, Àlex Moreno is not wanted back at Aston Villa. They seem
  very happy to return him to La Liga, with Girona considering whether to the
  sign the left-back on a permanent or loan deal. Tyler Morton is likely to
  leave Liverpool in the coming weeks and an interesting proposal has come his
  way, courtesy of Ligue 1 side Lyon. The French club could face a little bit of
  competition from West Ham. Another Anfield fringe man, Federico Chiesa was
  offered an exit route by José Mourinho but the Italian did not think a sojourn
  in the Turkish Super Lig was right for him, preferring a return to Serie A.
  Down in the Championship, Wrexham’s entertaining recruitment could continue
  with the signing of England centre-back Conor Coady from Leicester. It is
  difficult to forget Mamady Sidibé, the former Stoke striker who very rarely
  scored. His legacy lives in on at Stoke, in the form of his more talented
  18-year-old son Sol Sidibé. The midfielder is set to swap the Potteries for
  Eindhoven to join PSV on a four-year deal after the Championship club agreed a
  £2m deal with the Dutch side. Luton’s Lamine Fanne is wanted around Europe.
  Turkish side Konyaspor have already made contact with the Hatters about the
  Senegalese midfielder, who only moved to Kenilworth Road in January. Istanbul
  Basaksehir, Empoli and Copenhagen are also interested in the 21-year-old.
