  The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, has announced his country plans to
  formally recognise Palestine during the UN general assembly in September,
  after France and 14 other countries co-signed a declaration that pointed
  towards a wave of future recognitions of an independent Palestinian state.
  Canada’s plans follow similar announcements by France and the UK to formally
  recognise Palestine, while New Zealand and Australia were also signatories to
  a declaration that indicates they could follow suit in the coming months. The
  New York Call, published by the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, on
  Wednesday, said signatories “have already recognised, have expressed or
  express the willingness or the positive consideration of our countries to
  recognise the State of Palestine”. The signatories include Andorra, Australia,
  Canada, Finland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Portugal and San Marino, each of
  which has not yet recognised an independent Palestinian state. They also
  include Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Slovenia and Spain, which have.
  Emmanuel Macron last week said that France would recognise Palestinian
  statehood in the near future. The statement, which was published before the
  conclusion of a three-day UN conference set on reviving a two-state solution
  to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said the states would “reiterate our
  unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution where two
  democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within
  secure and recognised borders”. It stressed the “importance of unifying the
  Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”. On Wednesday
  evening, Carney said Canada would recognise the state of Palestine at the UN
  general assembly in September if certain conditions were met. He held a
  virtual cabinet meeting on the Middle East earlier on Wednesday. Carney said
  Canada would recognise Palestine if the Palestinian Authority, the body that
  governs the occupied West Bank, held an election in 2026 in which Palestinian
  militant group Hamas could play no part, and agreed to other democratic
  reforms. He called on Hamas to release all hostages it is holding, disarm, and
  play no role in the future governance of Palestine. In response, Iddo Moed,
  Israel’s ambassador to Canada, said Israel “will not bow to the distorted
  campaign of international pressure against it”. “We will not sacrifice our
  very existence by permitting the imposition of a jihadist state on our
  ancestral homeland that seeks our annihilation,” he said in a statement
  referring to Hamas, which seized power in Gaza in 2007. Donald Trump said in a
  post on Truth Social that it would be difficult to make a trade deal with
  Canada after Carney’s announcement. Canada and the US are working on
  negotiating a trade deal by 1 August, the date Trump is threatening to impose
  a 35% tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by a prior trade agreement.
  Carney’s remarks come amid growing pressure on Israel to end its military
  campaign in Gaza, which began in October 2023 in response to a Hamas raid that
  led to the deaths of 1,200 people, mainly Israelis, and the taking of more
  than 250 prisoners. More than 60,000 people have died in Gaza in the ensuing
  conflict, according to the Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza. Keir Starmer on
  Tuesday said that the UK would recognise the state of in September “unless the
  Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in
  Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term, sustainable peace,
  reviving the prospect of a two-state solution”. Donald Trump had initially
  said he didn’t “mind [Starmer] taking a position. I’m looking for getting
  people fed right now.” But later he condemned the decision to recognise a
  Palestinian state, saying onboard Air Force One that “you could make the case
  that you’re rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don’t think they should be
  rewarded. So I’m not in that camp, to be honest … because if you do that you
  are really rewarding Hamas. And I’m not about to do that.” The Australian
  prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said this week he wanted to time a
  recognition of Palestinian statehood to help achieve a breakthrough in
  negotiations. “What we’re looking at is the circumstances where recognition
  will advance the objective of the creation of two states,” Albanese said on
  Wednesday. “My entire political life, I’ve said I support two states, the
  right of Israel to exist within secure borders and the right of Palestinians
  to have their legitimate aspirations for their own state realised. That’s my
  objective.” Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Damon, condemned the
  declaration. “While our hostages are languishing in Hamas terror tunnels in
  Gaza, these countries choose to engage in hollow statements instead of
  investing their efforts in their release,” said Damon. “This is hypocrisy and
  a waste of time that legitimises terrorism and distances any chance of
  regional progress. Those who truly want to make progress should start with an
  unequivocal demand for the immediate return of all the hostages and the
  disarmament of Hamas.”
