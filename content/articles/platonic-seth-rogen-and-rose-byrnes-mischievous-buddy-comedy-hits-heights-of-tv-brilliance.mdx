  Platonic: Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne’s mischievous buddy comedy hits heights of
  TV brilliance

bodyText: >-
  Sylvia and Will are old college friends, without benefits, who have reunited
  in their 40s. They’re very close without being romantically interested in each
  other, and she has a habit of meddling in his relationships. Hmmm. We’re
  accustomed to onscreen chemistry of the explosive kind, which is generally
  used to exploit a heteronormative set-up. We see a man and woman getting
  along, and can’t help but wonder when they will burst into flames. Platonic
  (Apple TV+, from Wednesday), which stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne and returns
  for a second series, is flame-retardant. Will and the married Sylvia do not
  pine for or want to roll around on each other, but they do rely on, delight
  in, irritate and deeply understand each other. It’s a worthy addition to what
  we might call the Ephroniverse – the slim canon of stories about whether
  straight women and men can be friends. As their titles suggest, Platonic comes
  to a different conclusion than When Harry Met Sally. It’s the correct
  conclusion – so why is the question still interesting? Platonic digs into
  situations we’re more used to seeing in WhatsApp group chats. Sylvia is
  horrified that Will’s male friendships are more ribald than theirs is. Will
  realises he has incompatible personalities when he’s with his fiancee and
  oldest friend, so tries to avoid socialising with them together. Can a man and
  woman stay friends if his fiancee does not like her? Where do his allegiances
  lie? While these dilemmas could arise within any friendship, the gendered
  aspect has a specific thorniness. Despite the title, this is no philosophical
  treatise. It’s a comedy, occasionally a brilliant one. Rogen made his name in
  stoner-bro buddy-hang movies, but has elevated himself since. Watching him,
  I’m mostly wondering: which Muppet am I thinking of? Cookie Monster? Grover?
  Fozzie Bear? He’s actually a comic straight man, albeit one in whom silliness
  gleams. Take his pronunciation of Veuve Clicquot, which in Rogen’s mouth
  delightfully becomes “Voove.” (He’s trying to replace all the bubbly at his
  engagement party, after a friend of his misplaces an LSD-laced flute. “You’re
  saying this is a champagne problem?” smirks the shop assistant.) Byrne has
  proved equally funny, usually playing against her Audrey Hepburn looks. She’s
  nimble, intelligent, good with detail, able to play big or bone dry as
  required. She’s at her best when squashing discomfort. In the first episode of
  the new series, the engaged Will admits he has a crush on a young
  sandwich-maker. It’s a typical Platonic scenario, pitting Sylvia’s friendship
  obligations against her feminine solidarity. Byrne squirms as a reluctant
  wingwoman, yet manages to steer Will wisely, without preaching. “The thing
  about that girl in there that you have to remember is … she has a Deadpool
  tattoo. It’s terrible.” Platonic is a comforting watch – low-stakes but
  precisely observed and full of mischievous turns. The best of its cameos may
  be Saturday Night Live alumnus Beck Bennett as former party animal Wildcard,
  friend to both Sylvia and Will. (A laugh-out-loud scene in which he and Will
  discuss Sydney Sweeney has, against all odds, a kind of magical innocence.)
  Sylvia’s Jeopardy-loving husband and their sardonic children make welcome
  returns, alongside her acerbic mom-friend Katie, played by Carla Gallo. The
  show’s writing is equally weighted to its male and female stars, and it soars
  on their shared scenes, their bickering zephyrs. When all is said and done, it
  is a love story. TV has, in the past, contributed to a culturally threadbare
  understanding of that word. We should welcome this widening lens, a better
  aspect ratio to understand ourselves. If Platonic had solely been a Larry
  David-esque examination of friendship’s minutiae, it would have been perfect.
  There is a higher stakes romantic storyline running through that feels more
  generic, and may struggle to sustain 10 episodes of interest. Friendship,
  though, is something we can watch indefinitely, along with peppery dialogue,
  relatable dilemmas and absurd scenarios. It’s also a healthy reminder that
  chemistry doesn’t only mean combustible. More often, it’s about fizzing
  merrily along.
