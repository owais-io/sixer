  The world’s biggest spirits company, Diageo, has revealed a slump in annual
  profits and expanded its cost-cutting plan as it searches for a new boss after
  the resignation of the chief executive, Debra Crew. The FTSE 100 company,
  which owns brands including Guinness, Johnnie Walker whisky, Gordon’s gin and
  Smirnoff vodka, reported a nearly 28% fall in operating profit in the 12
  months to the end of June compared with a year earlier. The drinks maker also
  upped its target for cost savings from £500m to £625m. The interim CEO, Nik
  Jhangiani, said the savings were “not about job cuts”, adding that while some
  roles would go, the overall workforce could still increase. The figures come
  weeks after the surprise announcement that the group had begun the hunt for a
  successor to Crew, who it said had stepped down “by mutual agreement”, after a
  period of investor disquiet over its declining share price. The group also
  reiterated that it expected an annual hit of $200m from Donald Trump’s
  tariffs. The figure – first floated in February – assumes there are no further
  changes to rates on imports into the US, meaning the 10% levy remains on UK
  drink, along with the 15% on the EU, while Mexican and Canadian spirits remain
  exempt. The tariffs on British goods came into effect on 30 June, when the
  UK-US trade deal kicked in, while the new 15% levy on EU goods will begin on 7
  August as part of the White House’s suite of “reciprocal” tariffs being
  imposed on dozens of the US’s trading partners. The British drinks company
  said it had “continued to undertake considerable contingency planning” in
  recent months, and remained “focused on what we can control in relation to
  tariffs”. Diageo said it had been working to mitigate the impact of tariffs,
  carrying out work including “inventory management, supply chain optimisation
  and reallocation of investments”. As a result, the company believes it will be
  able to mitigate about half of the impact of tariffs on its operating profit.
  Diageo’s performance was lacklustre under Crew, who took the helm in 2023
  after the sudden illness and death of Ivan Menezes – a popular figure who led
  Diageo successfully for 10 years. Early in Crew’s tenure the company issued a
  profits warning as a result of a sales slump in Latin America and the
  Caribbean, while last Christmas the company was seen to have misjudged its
  supply chain, and UK pubs complained that their flow of Guinness had been
  rationed shortly before the festive season. She has been replaced on an
  interim basis by Jhangiani, the company’s chief financial officer, leaving
  Diageo on the hunt for a permanent boss and finance chief. Jhangiani said
  Diageo had experienced a “challenging year” but noted certain brands including
  Guinness, Don Julio tequila and the blackberry-infused Canadian whisky Crown
  Royal Blackberry were standout performers. “There is clearly much more to do
  across our broader portfolio and brands,” he said. Diageo’s shares have fallen
  by more than a quarter so far this year, making them the third-worst performer
  on the FTSE 100 in share price terms, according to analysis by the broker AJ
  Bell. The share price is no higher than it was in 2016. The company’s shares
  have also been hit by changes in drinking habits, especially among younger
  consumers, while the cost of living crisis has resulted in some people
  switching to cheaper brands.
