  Third time was the charm on Tuesday for the launch of SpaceX’s Starship
  megarocket after the launch had been scrubbed two times in as many days. The
  success of this 10th flight proved the spacecraft had overcome its past
  failures key to the Mars rocket’s reusable design. The stainless steel
  behemoth, 403ft (123 meters) tall, lifted off from the company’s Starbase in
  southern Texas at 6.30pm local time (2330 GMT), to loud cheers from
  engineering teams, a webcast showed. This mission was to be a test of the
  ship’s new heat shield tiles and satellite deployment abilities, among
  hundreds of other upgrades from past iterations. The rocket’s upper half
  separated as planned from its Super Heavy booster, the 232-ft-tall first stage
  that normally returns to land in its launch tower’s giant catch-arms, but on
  Tuesday targeted the Gulf of Mexico waters to demonstrate an alternate landing
  engine configuration. Shortly after reaching space, Starship’s “Pez”-like
  satellite deployment system dispensed mock Starlink satellites for the first
  time, a milestone SpaceX either cancelled or failed to reach during past
  tests. Starship made a successful splashdown in the Indian Ocean after
  enduring intense heat through its atmospheric reentry – a crucial phase of the
  test that has shredded the rocket on past flights. The 10th test flight comes
  after a string of explosive failures that raised doubts about whether the
  world’s most powerful launch vehicle can fulfill founder Elon Musk’s vision of
  colonizing Mars or helping Nasa return astronauts to the moon. SpaceX will not
  attempt to catch the booster from Tuesday’s flight because the component would
  instead be used for in-flight experiments “to gather real-world performance
  data on future flight profiles and off-nominal scenarios”. Monday’s launch
  scrub was blamed on weather as thick clouds, hanging overhead for much of the
  day, forced a delay with a mere 40 seconds left on the countdown clock. A
  Sunday attempt was scrubbed due to a liquid oxygen leak at the Starship
  launchpad, billionaire Musk wrote on X overnight. Much is riding on the
  mission, after the last three flights ended with the upper stage exploding:
  twice over the Caribbean and once after reaching space. In June, an upper
  stage blew up during a ground test. “We’ve had so many tests and it hasn’t
  proven itself reliable,” Dallas Kasaboski, a space analyst for consulting firm
  Analysys Mason, told AFP. “The successes have not exceeded the failures.” The
  goal is to send the upper stage ship – eventually intended to carry crew and
  cargo – halfway across the globe before splashing down off north-western
  Australia. Outfitted with prototype heat-shield materials, it will deploy
  dummy Starlink satellites while flying a trajectory meant to stress-test its
  rear flaps. The booster, known as Super Heavy, will splash down in the Gulf of
  Mexico. While SpaceX previously wowed observers by catching the booster in the
  launch tower’s “chopstick arms”, this flight will instead focus on data
  collection under less-than-ideal flight profiles. This year, two Starship
  tests have failed early in flight, with another failure in space on its ninth
  flight, and a “catastrophic explosion” of test stand in June that destroyed a
  Starship and sent debris flying into nearby Mexican territory have tested
  SpaceX’s capital-intensive test-to-failure development approach, in which new
  iterations of rocket prototypes are flown to their technical limits. That
  ethos is markedly different from SpaceX’s rivals such as Jeff Bezos’s Blue
  Origin, whose New Glenn rocket made an operational debut in January following
  years of on-the-ground development and testing. The new Vulcan rocket from
  United Launch Alliance, co-owned by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, had a similar
  upbringing before its 2024 debut. Despite recent setbacks, Starship is not
  seen as being at a crisis point. SpaceX’s “fail fast, learn fast” philosophy
  has already given it a commanding lead in launches with its Falcon rockets,
  while Dragon capsules ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and
  Starlink has become a geopolitical asset. Still, Starship presents new
  challenges. Musk has identified developing a fully reusable orbital heat
  shield as the toughest task, noting it took nine months to refurnish the space
  shuttle’s heat shield between flights. “What we’re trying to achieve here with
  Starship is to have a heat shield that can be flown immediately,” he said on a
  webcast Monday. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet business, a major source
  of company revenue, is also tied to Starship’s success. Musk aims to use
  Starship to launch larger batches of Starlink satellites, which have so far
  been deployed by SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket into space. Musk, for his
  part, remained bullish. “In about 6 or 7 years, there will be days where
  Starship launches more than 24 times in 24 hours,” the entrepreneur said on
  Sunday, replying to a user on X. Another hurdle is proving Starship can be
  refueled in orbit with super-cooled propellant – an essential but untested
  step for the vehicle to carry out deep-space missions. Time is running short
  to ready a modified version for Nasa’s lunar lander for 2027, and for Musk to
  make good on his vow to send an uncrewed Starship to Mars next year.
