  The Trump administration is reviewing the records of more than 55 million US
  visa holders for potential revocation or deportable violations of immigration
  rules, in a significant expansion of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. In
  a move first reported by the Associated Press, the state department said that
  all of the foreigners who currently hold valid US visas are subject to
  “continuous vetting” for any indication that they could be ineligible for the
  document, including those already admitted into the country. Should such
  evidence come to light, the visa would be revoked and, if the visa holder were
  in the United States, they would be subject to deportation. “The State
  Department revokes visas any time there are indications of a potential
  ineligibility, which includes things like any indicators of overstays,
  criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist
  activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization,” a department
  spokesperson said. It follows an announcement by the Trump administration on
  Tuesday that it will look for “anti-American” views, including on social
  media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United
  States. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which handles
  requests to stay in the US or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting
  of the social media postings of applicants and that “reviews for anti-American
  activity will be added to that vetting”. “America’s benefits should not be
  given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,”
  said a USCIS spokesperson, Matthew Tragesser. “US Citizenship and Immigration
  Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out
  anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and
  vetting measures to the fullest extent possible. Immigration benefits –
  including to live and work in the United States – remain a privilege, not a
  right.” Historically, the notion of anti-Americanism has primarily focused on
  communism. But since taking office in January, the Trump administration has
  moved aggressively to deny or rescind short-term visas for people deemed to go
  against US foreign policy interests, especially regarding Israel. Indeed, the
  latest guidance on immigration decisions said that authorities will look at
  whether applicants “promote antisemitic ideologies”. The Trump administration
  has accused students and universities of antisemitism and support for
  terrorism over participation in protests in support of Palestinian rights and
  against Israel’s military assault on Gaza, charges denied by the activists. In
  April, the administration revoked or changed the legal status of hundreds of
  international students, only to reinstate them several weeks later. In May,
  student visa interviews were temporarily halted, and then, in June, new social
  media vetting measures were introduced for international students applying to
  study in the US. Under the new measures, foreign students are required to
  unlock their social media profiles to allow US diplomats to review their
  online activity before receiving educational and exchange visas. Those who
  fail to do so are to be suspected of hiding that activity from US officials.
  On Monday, the state department said it had revoked 6,000 student visas for
  overstays and violations of local, state and federal law since the secretary
  of state, Marco Rubio, took office in January. In the “vast majority” of the
  cases – approximately 4,000 – visas were revoked because the holders “broke
  the law” in cases of assault, driving under the influence, burglary and
  “support for terrorism”.
