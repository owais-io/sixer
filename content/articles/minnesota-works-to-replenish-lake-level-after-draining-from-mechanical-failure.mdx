  Minnesota officials are working to restore water to one of the state’s lakes
  after “a mechanical failure of the water control structure” there caused it to
  drain significantly over the weekend. In a statement on Monday, the Minnesota
  department of natural resources (DNR) said that it was responding to the issue
  at Lake Alice in William O’Brien state park while noting that the malfunction
  in question had resulted in a “significant drawdown of the lake level”. The
  department as of Monday said that “only a stream remains on Lake Alice at this
  time” and warned visitors that water recreation on the lake would probably be
  affected for “at least four to six weeks”. The lake’s swimming beach is not
  currently usable, and the drawdown has “caused a fish kill in the lake”,
  officials added. Lake Alice is typically 9ft (2.7 meters) deep and spans 26
  acres (10 hectares), according to the DNR’s website. In a Monday afternoon
  update on social media, officials with Minnesota state parks and trails said
  that Lake Alice was “spring-fed lake with an earthen dike that holds water
  back”, and it had a 65-year-old water concrete control structure that “can be
  manually operated to manage lake levels by allowing water to flow out into the
  St Croix River”. “Due to heavy precipitation last month, water levels on Lake
  Alice were steadily increasing,” said the statement from officials. The
  statement added that when water levels became “high enough that water was
  flowing over the dike between the lake and the St Croix River, DNR staff
  opened the water control structure’s valve to release excess water from Lake
  Alice”. “Upon attempting to close the valve over the weekend, staff discovered
  the control structure closure mechanism had failed and was stuck open, which
  has caused the lake to drain,” the statement continued. The statement said
  staff had since been working to resolve the issue, but a “timeline for
  restoring lake levels is not known yet”.
