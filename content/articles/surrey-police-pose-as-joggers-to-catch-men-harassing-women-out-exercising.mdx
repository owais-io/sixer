  Eighteen people have been arrested after a police force sent out female
  undercover officers posing as joggers to catch men harassing women while they
  are out exercising. A pilot operation from Surrey police deployed female
  officers in running gear during rush hour to expose how often women are
  harassed. The pilot has resulted in 18 arrests for offences such as
  harassment, sexual assault and theft. Insp Jon Vale, Surrey’s violence against
  women and girls safer spaces lead, said a survey found almost half of female
  runners in one area of the county did not report harassment to the police. He
  said catcalling was “far too common”, with off-duty female officers and staff
  members experiencing this behaviour. Although it is not a specific criminal
  offence, catcalling is known to sometimes escalate to more serious sexual
  offending. The month-long trial, which was first reported by LBC, involved
  plainclothes officers volunteering to jog in sports gear through areas
  identified as harassment hotspots, with nearby specialist units ready to
  intervene if they faced abuse. Uniformed officers are also working with
  community groups to share insight into the force’s work to tackle violence
  against women and girls. Vale told LBC that the aim was to deter offenders.
  “One of our officers was honked at within 10 minutes, then another vehicle
  slowed down, beeping and making gestures just 30 seconds later – that’s how
  frequent it is. “Someone slowing down, staring, shouting, even if it’s not
  always criminal, it can have a huge impact on people’s everyday lives and
  stops women from doing something as simple as going for a run. We have to ask:
  ‘Is that person going to escalate? Are they a sexual offender?’ We want to
  manage that risk early,” he said. In a statement, he added: “To date, we have
  made a number of interventions following reports of harassment of our
  plainclothes runners. In these cases, it was deemed appropriate to provide
  education around antisocial behaviour. “For repeat offenders or where the
  behaviour is more serious, we will robustly pursue all criminal justice
  outcomes. We recognise this is a significant worry for women and girls, and
  we’ll continue to patrol running routes.” PC Abby Hayward, who went
  undercover, said her experience reflected a daily reality for women. “This
  behaviour is either a precursor to something more serious, or it’s ignorance
  and it’s fixable. That’s where our interventions come in: to stop potential
  repeat offenders or help people understand that what they’re doing isn’t OK,”
  she said. Surrey police said they had developed the pilot out of work
  installing plainclothes police officers in bars, clubs and town centres at
  night to spot predatory behaviour and combat harassment. Other forces have
  considered unconventional methods to reduce catcalling. The Metropolitan
  police offered a buddy system in which officers joined groups from a women’s
  running club in London in response to concerns about the harassment of
  members. A study last year by the University of Manchester found that more
  than two-thirds of women surveyed in north-west England had experienced
  harassment while running, including threats, verbal abuse and having objects
  thrown at them. Women told the researchers that they no longer report abuse to
  the police as it had become an “everyday occurrence”. A separate study last
  year by Sport England suggested almost three-quarters of women changed their
  exercise routine during the winter months.
