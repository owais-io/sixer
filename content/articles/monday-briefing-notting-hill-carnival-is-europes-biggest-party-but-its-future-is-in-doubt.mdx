  Good morning. Anyone straying near west London this bank holiday weekend will
  hear thumping bass from the Notting Hill carnival. Two million revellers will
  be drawn to the streets draped in flags and decked in jewels to enjoy the
  world’s second largest carnival after Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. London’s
  celebration of Caribbean heritage, arts and culture dates back to 1966.
  Yesterday was family day, with streets lined with hundreds of food stalls and
  smoke from barbecues filling the air. Today will be the bigger celebration,
  with huge crowds and more partying, attracting people from around the globe
  with parades, soca music and masquerade bands. But this year’s carnival almost
  didn’t happen. It was saved a few weeks ago only by a £1m cash injection from
  the local council, but funding hasn’t been the only problem: disagreements
  have been boiling over about policing, use of facial recognition software, and
  negative press after a shocking death last year. For today’s newsletter, I
  spoke to Guardian arts and culture correspondent Lanre Bakare about the past
  of this iconic cultural event, and whether recent funding issues say anything
  about its future. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war
  | Israeli aircraft and tanks have pounded the eastern and northern outskirts
  of Gaza City, destroying buildings and homes, as Israeli leaders vowed to
  press on with an expanded large-scale offensive on the city. Politics | MPs
  have raised the alarm about a rise in abuse linked to debates around
  immigration, with some reporting levels of online harassment and death threats
  worse than during the Brexit years. UK news | Ministers will legislate next
  month to abolish most short prison sentences, toughen up community punishments
  and introduce a Texas-inspired system whereby inmates can earn early release
  as part of an attempt to avert another prison crisis. US news | Donald Trump
  has “manufactured a crisis” to justify the notion of sending federalised
  national guard troops into Chicago next, over the heads of local leaders, a
  leading Democrat said. Ukraine | Moscow has accused Kyiv of launching dozens
  of drone attacks, including one that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant,
  as Ukrainians marked 34 years since the country gained independence from the
  Soviet Union. In depth: ‘There’s so many people for whom carnival is the
  centre of their year’ Historians believe the idea of carnival was started by
  enslaved people in Trinidad and Tobago in the late 18th century, engaging in
  satirical reenactments to mock their oppressors. “Carnival has always been
  this very subversive, chaotic thing,” said Lanre Bakare. The carnival in
  London dates back almost seven decades, starting as a celebration of
  resistance in an openly racist Britain. The first version of the carnival was
  created by a remarkable racial equality activist called Claudia Jones, who
  wanted to bring Caribbean culture to the forefront of British life. “There’s
  so many people for whom it is the centre of their year – it’s like Christmas,
  or Eid. It’s a huge event for people – especially those of Caribbean descent,”
  said Lanre. During the seventies, amid wider racial tensions in Britain and
  the growing presence of far right groups such as the National Front, conflict
  with the police during carnival swelled. The most famous flashpoint was in
  1976 when there were serious riots after heavy policing. It signaled the start
  of a style of policing that was typified by heavy duty fencing, larger police
  numbers and stricter curfews. Many felt the carnival was being seen by
  authorities as a site of disorder as opposed to a celebration of culture.
  Activists defended it as a vital expression of Black British culture, and the
  festival became a symbol of resistance. “That seems a key turning point,” said
  Lanre. “Black people took on the police and said, ‘this is our event, and
  we’re going to run it the way we want’, and that changed the way that carnival
  was policed. And we can still see the legacy of that today.” *** Why can’t
  carnival find funding? In June, it emerged the celebration could be in
  jeopardy without “urgent funding” from the government, according to a leaked
  letter from its organisers. The event’s future was secured just in time this
  year after City Hall, Kensington and Chelsea council and Westminster city
  council together provided £958,000 for the event after pleas from organisers
  for support. The deputy leader of Kensington and Chelsea council said the
  additional funding it provided would be for “this year only” (the council
  already has an £80m budget gap). Last year’s carnival was marred by the
  violent murder of 32-year-old Cher Maximen, who was killed in front of her
  three-year-old daughter on family day. For many commentators, crime and
  violence is the only story of the weekend – it is viewed through the prism of
  crime in a way that other festivals are not. However, arrest rates at Notting
  Hill carnival have been very similar to those at music festivals such as
  Glastonbury, especially when the huge size of the carnival crowds is taken
  into account. “If you look at the way black culture and black people are
  covered in the mainstream press in general, often it is in the context of
  crime and criminality. Especially for media on the right, there is a bit of an
  obsession with that and I think it’s fair to say that some of that coverage is
  racist,” said Lanre. This narrative has serious implications for efforts to
  get funding. “It’s getting harder for the carnival to get sponsorship because
  of the constant negative press coverage of the event, which really focuses on
  crime,” Lanre added. *** What are the issues with facial recognition? The size
  of the carnival makes it the largest public order challenge for the
  Metropolitan police. Each year about 7,000 police are deployed. Figures
  released in 2023 put the cost of policing the event at £11.7m. The Met said
  last month it would deploy specially mounted cameras at entries and exits amid
  staff shortages, thanks to budget cuts, and a rise in the number of protests
  they have to cover, particularly related to Palestine and the environment. The
  Met claim that the aim of using this facial recognition technology is to
  extract unique biometric data from people’s faces and compare it against a
  “watchlist” of thousands of people already sought by the police, indicating a
  level of policing not present at other festivals. The Equality and Human
  Rights Commission (EHRC) has pointed out the problem with this sort of
  technology use, and said it could have a “chilling effect” on individuals’
  rights. Data seen by the EHRC shows that the number of black men triggering an
  “alert” by the technology is higher than would be expected proportionally when
  compared with the population of London. And the framing of the event in terms
  of its potential for public disorder before it’s even started has been called
  out before, with the Met police linking knife and drug seizures as far away as
  Catford in south London to the carnival starting in the following days. “The
  police are there with technology that isn’t really proven, and it does have
  serious flaws in it. Yet it’s being road-tested at an event which is attended
  by some of the most over-policed people in the UK, so there’s a tension
  there,” said Lanre. Down the decades the scenes of officers strutting their
  stuff was seen as a cheesy but welcome attempt at repairing strained community
  relations, writes Vikram Dodd. But in a further blow to the spirit of the
  carnival, the Met also released a statement earlier this month stating it
  would ban police from dancing. In a statement the Metropolitan police said
  officers “are there to keep revellers safe, not to join in the revelling”.
  Clearly they feel a rhythmic shake of the hips may distract or slow down any
  one of their 7,000 officers. *** What does this all mean for the future of
  carnival? All of this has led to further discussion about the management of
  carnival, in ways that many feel would limit its scope and its soul. Susan
  Hall, leader of the Conservative group at City Hall, said that the event
  should be ticketed to control the crowds. Some have suggested moving the
  carnival to Hyde Park, or somewhere that is more open, to make policing
  easier. “When people talk about ticketing, or moving into Hyde Park, there is
  a fundamental misunderstanding of what carnival is. It isn’t just a party,
  it’s an expression of Caribbean culture – first and foremost – and it’s also a
  rebellious thing. It’s not something you can just stick anywhere,” said Lanre.
  Eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt, who went to carnival on Sunday,
  said any attempt to move it out of its traditional home would kill one of the
  UK’s most important cultural events. Ian Comfort, chair of Notting Hill
  Carnival Ltd, says if the funding situation doesn’t change his company
  wouldn’t be able to run carnival because it wouldn’t be safe. “There is
  nothing like carnival. It is completely unique and yet the organisation that
  runs it gets no funding from DCMS [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and
  Sport] or from the Arts Council,” said Lanre. “Carnival needs to be seen in
  the same way that the Royal Opera House or the National Portrait Gallery are.”
  Lanre said he doesn’t see a future where Notting Hill carnival is fully shut
  down anywhere on the horizon. But, he added, “The key to it becoming
  sustainable is for the funding model to change, and for the attitude towards
  it to change.” What else we’ve been reading Gaby Hinsliff’s excellent
  interview with a slightly squirmy Nick Clegg is a fascinating insight into the
  former deputy prime minister, as he reflects on the lessons Labour can learn
  to prevent Britain falling down the same rightwing populist path. Tara
  Russell, newsletters team The Guardian successfully defended a libel action
  brought by Noel Clarke over our investigation in which the actor was accused
  of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women. In case you missed it, this
  engrossing run-down of the case by my brilliant colleague Haroon Siddique is
  well worth a read. Aamna I loved Kaamil Ahmed’s piece reporting on protests
  for Indigenous land rights recognition on lands which are now occupied by a
  tiger reserve in India. Kaamil sheds light on the complex challenges of
  decolonisation. Tara Food writer Corin Hirsch learned she was adopted as a
  young child. As an adult, she faced painful rejection when she tried to
  reunite with her birth mother. Then a straight-talking judge helped her. Aamna
  Michael Hogan’s interview with Alison Hammond is pure serotonin. From the
  presenter’s Bake-Off antics to her disarmingly honest reflections on grief,
  it’s hard to read this one without grinning. Tara Sport Football | In their
  first game at Hill Dickinson Stadium, Everton defeated Brighton 2-0, with Man
  City loanee Jack Grealish turning in a strong performance. In Sunday’s other
  Premier League game, Emil Smith-Rowe’s late equaliser earned Fulham a point
  against Manchester United. Tennis | Emma Raducanu overcame a significant
  mental hurdle and earned her first US Open victory since her 2021 title run,
  dispatching Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara with a dominant 6-1, 6-2 display.
  Rugby | Ireland opened their Women’s Rugby World Cup journey with a decisive
  six-try win over Japan at Franklin’s Gardens, giving them hope of making the
  last eight. Ireland is set to play Spain in a second Pool C game next Sunday.
  The front pages “MPs report sharp rise in online abuse over the immigration
  debate,” is the headline on Guardian on Monday, as the Times runs with
  “Pressure grows for PM to get grip on asylum claims,” and the i: “Channel
  migrants first for fast-track asylum hearings as Cooper moves to close
  hotels.” “Virginia’s revenge,” is the lead story at the Sun, focusing on a new
  book by Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent accusers,
  which is set to be published posthumously. “Whitewash”, says the Mirror, with
  the following subhead: “Victims of Epstein slam Maxwell lies.” “Andrew facing

  Kyiv’s long-range missiles,” says the Telegraph, while the FT has: “Private
  equity firms offer ‘cascade of discounts’ in scramble to raise money.” Finally

  Morocco.” Today in Focus Missing in the Amazon: the disappearance Three years
