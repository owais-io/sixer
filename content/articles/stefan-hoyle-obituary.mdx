  My son, Stefan Hoyle, who has died suddenly aged 33, was a Manchester-based
  musician who was also a DJ under the name Syd Far-I, specialising in
  jungle/drum’n’bass, but was also known for sets of older Jamaican reggae.
  Stefan was born and brought up in Manchester, where I and his mother, Bev
  Gallier, are both involved in the music scene. I am a musician and Bev works
  for Factory International/Aviva Studios. Stefan went to primary school in the
  Longsight and Levenshulme areas, where he soaked up the music and culture of
  his many friends in the Asian, Caribbean and Irish communities, and later to
  South Chadderton school in the north of the city. This multicultural childhood
  gave him an appreciation of the lives of others, a worldview that would lead
  him to befriend many of those who had no hope of help anywhere else. An
  intuitive and talented musician, Stefan was equally at home deejaying and
  making music for the underground free party scene as he was teaching classical
  guitar in a squat setting. In 2013, Stefan joined my band, Dub Sex, as
  guitarist, playing large venues and festivals such as Kendal Calling,
  Strummercamp and Festival No 6 in Portmeirion. In 2016, he performed a
  15-minute ambient piece, Soundscape One, at the Whitworth Art Gallery in
  Manchester. He leaves behind an unfinished solo album of jungle/drum’n’bass,
  which will be completed by his sister, and frequent collaborator, Ellis. To
  support himself, Stefan worked in construction, IT and restaurants. Running
  alongside his musical pursuits, he was a member of the Loose Space Collective,
  which repurposes, without official funding, disused landmark buildings in
  Manchester such as the former Cornerhouse cinema and the abandoned Hulme
  Hippodrome theatre, as places to provide help, food, entertainment and a sense
  of connection to people in need. Stefan worked on the projects as a labourer,
  acted as a spokesperson and designed leaflets for them. He was a well-known
  member of Manchester’s alternative community. Plans are under way to raise
  funds to build a sound system in his name, to be based at the Niamos arts
  centre in Hulme. He is survived by Bev, Ellis and me.
