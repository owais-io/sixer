  subplots galore

  HERE. WE. GO Will Liverpool canter to another title? Have Manchester City
  rediscovered their mojo? Have Arsenal finally found the missing pieces of the
  jigsaw? Will Chelsea’s midsummer Copa Gianni endeavours catch up with them?
  Can any or all of the three promoted sides make a decent fist of not going
  straight back down this time? Will Fulham finish 11th or 12th? How adverse an
  effect will being the father of twins going through the terrible twos have on
  the form of Jarrod Bowen? Some early clues to the answers of these and many
  other questions will be provided this weekend as the latest beautifully
  packaged model of the Premier League rolls off the assembly line, kicking off
  with tonight’s ding-dong between Liverpool and what’s left of a Bournemouth
  carcass that has been feasted upon by a wake of vultures during the transfer
  window. A club so resilient and resourceful that at one point they exhibited
  the massed ranks of their lame and halt David Blaine-style in a perspex box at
  the Vitality Stadium, Andoni Iraola’s side will almost certainly be just fine.
  Hopes are high that we might have a title race on our hands and in Viktor
  Gyökeres, Arsenal have finally got that big No 9 their fans have craved for so
  long. With decent cover in every position and another graduate from the
  Emirates creche, Max Dowman [born December 2009 – Football Daily Ed] ready to
  take his first tentative steps into the top-flight cauldron, there are high
  hopes this season might finally be the mythical “next season” we’ve been
  assured has been coming for the past four years. Of course, it’s all fun and
  games until somebody loses one or more key players to the random vagaries of
  mid- to long-term knack, gah and ouch as Arsenal, Manchester City and various
  other clubs discovered in the last campaign, while others – including the
  reigning champions – remained comparatively unscathed. Beyond the obvious
  title contenders there are currently countless imponderables. Are Everton good
  again? Has the cloud over Old Trafford reached peak mushroom? What now for
  Alexander Isak? Will the Thomas Frank factor work at Spurs? In deciding to
  stick with Daniel Farke, Leeds are adjudged to have taken something of a
  gamble on an apparently decent coach whose previous Premier League forays have
  been a study in dignified mournfulness. Farke may well be the first top-flight
  manager to lose his job unless somebody tonks Burnley first and Scott Parker
  goes full Scott Parker. While their north-eastern neighbours try to prepare
  for the new season in the face of an unseemly, very public and ongoing one-man
  mutiny, Sunderland have quietly gone about the business of unveiling 11 (and
  counting) on-the-face-of-it astute new signings. That suggests they might
  finally have put that Netflix banter era behind them, but given the club’s
  history of slapstick, only time will tell. With this season’s relegation
  places looking nowhere near as nailed-on as last year, the scramble to avoid
  them could go right down to the wire. Or at the very least, early April. In,
  among, and around the football we’ll have all the usual controversies, gripes
  and grumbles about on-field and in-bunker officialdom, a body of men and women
  whose already difficult job is being made increasingly tough by forensic
  scrutiny, the rise of Ref Cam, occasionally inexplicable ineptitude and an
  increasingly unfathomable handball law that seems tailored specifically to
  infuriate, baffle and enrage. Oh yes, the Premier League is back and to
  paraphrase the late American comedian Bill Hicks, bear with it while managers,
  players and broadcasters everywhere plaster on a fake smile and plough through
  this sh!t one more time. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE The Premier League is back, baby.
  Join Scott Murray for big-match buildup and live updates from Liverpool 0-0
  Bournemouth (8pm BST kick-off). QUOTE OF THE DAY This season you want to make
  sure that you don’t lose those stupid points. There were a few games where we
  analysed them back and said to ourselves: ‘This can’t happen’” – Youri
  Tielemans gets his chat on with Ben Fisher, and reveals how Aston Villa have
  done the research and will be higher up the table if they cut down on daft
  mistakes. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Harking back to recent discussions about
  nominative determinism, is Régis Le Bris predestined to wind up at Bristol
  City*, take them to the promised land of the Premier League, and be declared
  King of Bristol?” – Phil Taverner (*other Bristol-based clubs also apparently
  available). May I be one of the 1,057 pedants who point out the
  definitely-not-workshy Wayne Rooney is [almost] right in saying the NFL season
  only lasts three months. Each team plays just 17 matches during the 18
  weekends of the regular season. That’s just nine days into month four. The
  playoffs, leading to the Super Bowl, take place during the post-season” –
  Geraint. Peter MacLeod (yesterday’s Football Daily letters) may have started
  something with his ‘keeper moniker sweep. Although pedantry isn’t
  (necessarily) involved, may I be the first of 1,057 to supplement with
  ‘handyman’?” – Clinton Macsherry. In India the goalkeeper is often referred to
  in the media as ‘The Guardian of the Citadel’” – Ross Dunning. If you have
  any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our
  prizeless letter o’ the day is … Phil Taverner. Terms and conditions for our
  competitions, when we run them, can be viewed here.  RECOMMENDED BOOKING On
  Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly
  favourites Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for an evening of
  unfiltered football punditry at Troxy in London. The pod will also be
  livestreamed globally. Book now.  QUESTION TIME Our Matchday live blogs will
  be running across the weekend. Our London-based reporter Ed Aarons will be
  answering questions on Saturday before the Spurs v Burnley match. If you have
