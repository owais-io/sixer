  A judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against a defendant in
  connection with vandalism against construction equipment at the future site of
  the police training center near Atlanta, Georgia, colloquially known as Cop
  City, in what is seen as a win for protesters. DeKalb superior court judge
  Gregory Adams ruled on Thursday that defendant Jamie Marsicano’s due process
  and constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated by the state’s
  ongoing delays and failure to issue an indictment two and a half years after
  arresting them at a nearby music festival. “The judge acknowledged that the
  state was delaying on purpose, which is what the public suspected and
  activists have been saying,” said Xavier de Janon, Marsicano’s attorney. “It’s
  the idea that the process is the punishment.” Opposition to the $109m center,
  which opened this spring, has come from a wide range of local and national
  organizations and protesters, and is centered on concerns around police
  militarization and clearing forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta
  police say the center is needed for “world-class” training and to attract new
  officers. In the last three years, the state has leveled domestic terrorism
  charges against opponents of the training center in DeKalb as well as Rico
  conspiracy charges in neighboring Fulton county, using a statute that is
  usually reserved for organized crime. Marsicano faced charges in both places.
  In a hearing last week over the DeKalb delays, De Janon called the state’s
  attempt to level charges in two counties based on the same alleged acts,
  “trying to get two bites of the apple”. Marsicano is also likely to be one of
  the first of 61 defendants soon to be tried in the Rico case, the largest
  criminal corruption indictment ever brought against members of a protest or
  social movement. Meanwhile, in the last several years, Marsicano has graduated
  law school in North Carolina and passed the bar, only to have the state board
  of law examiners decline to issue a license to practice due to the unresolved
  charges. Judge Adams wrote that the “personal and professional consequences
  that [Marsicano] has faced as a result of this indefinite charge … are forms
  of actual prejudice”. “Domestic terrorism shows up on housing and job
  applications – it’s a deep social and political stigma,” Marsicano said. Adams
  also wrote that Georgia’s deputy attorney general, John Fowler, had been using
  the DeKalb charges “to gain a tactical advantage” over Marsicano. De Janon
  noted that the state had continued to gather evidence on Marsicano despite the
  charges in both counties stemming from the same alleged acts, and the deadline
  for gathering discovery material in the Rico case having passed. In the DeKalb
  hearing last week, Fowler said for the first time that delays were due in part
  to there being 14 terabytes of evidence – the equivalent of more than 3m
  photos and an amount at least twice any previous number cited by the state.
  “That means there’s evidence we haven’t seen,” De Janon told the Guardian.
  Thursday’s decision is the second time charges have been dismissed during the
  three years the state has sought to punish dozens in connection to their
  opposition to the police training center. Last September, Fowler dropped
  money-laundering charges underlying 15 of the 18 counts included in the Rico,
  or racketeering, indictment, against members of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, a
  bail fund. De Janon also noted that judges in several hearings tied to Cop
  City “have reprimanded the state” for conduct such as missing deadlines and
  sharing privileged attorney-client information. This, together with the
  dismissal of charges, “shows the state’s intense prosecution is starting to
  shatter”.
