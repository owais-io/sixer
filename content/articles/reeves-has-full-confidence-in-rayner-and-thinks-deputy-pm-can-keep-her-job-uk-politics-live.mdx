  In her interviews this morning Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary,
  would not say whether she expected Angela Rayner to remain in post. Asked on
  LBC whether she thought that Rayner would still be deputy PM at the end of the
  year, Phillipson said she did not want to “speculate on or pre-judge” the
  outcome of the inquiry from the No 10 ethics adviser. She went on: We’ve got a
  process that’s under way with the independent adviser. I’m not going to get
  into hypotheticals or speculate. I’m sorry to disappoint you. I’m just not
  going to do it. That process will run its course. But Rachel Reeves, the
  chancellor, has given an interview to Sky News this morning, and she was
  willing to back Rayner unequivocally. Asked if Rayner could stay in post
  despite the stamp duty mistake, Reeves replied: Yes, I have full confidence in
  Angela Rayner. She’s a good friend and a colleague. She has accepted the right
  stamp duty wasn’t paid. That was an error, that was a mistake. She is working
  hard now to rectify that, in contact with HMRC, to make sure that the correct
  tax is paid. Anyone that saw Angela’s statement yesterday, saw her interview
  yesterday, I think will have a lot of sympathy with some of the challenging
  family circumstances around this, around Angela’s disabled son. But of course,
  it is right that people pay their right amount of tax, and it’s important that
  people in public life lead by example. And that’s why Angela has referred
  herself to the independent adviser on ethics. Bridget Phillipson was giving
  interviews this morning to promote the extension of free childcare in England,
  that took effect this week. There will be a ministerial statement on this in
  the Commons from Stephen Morgan, the early years minister, at about 11.30am.
  Good morning. Keir Starmer does not want to lose Angela Rayner, and his
  defence of her in the Commons yesterday was a lot more robust than usual for a
  PM commenting on a minister who has self-referred to the ethics adviser, but
  Starmer does not have total control over what is going to happen. Quite a lot
  of the facts are not in the public domain, and may not be known to Starmer
  himself (mainly – what exactly was the tax advice Rayner had that led her to
  think she did not need to pay a higher rate of stamp duty, and how much had
  Rayner disclosed to these advisers?), and although in theory Starmer can
  ignore a recommendation from Sir Laurie Magnus, the ethics adviser
  investigating Rayner, there is a chance Magnus could come up with conclusions
  that make resignation inevitable. Here is our overnight story about Rayner’s
  plight. Magnus is expected to report soonish – within days, rather than weeks
  – but until he does the government will be in limbo. There are various new
  developments in the story this morning, but none that dramatically alter
  Rayner’s survival prospects. Here are the key lines. Rayner was told on Monday
  that her original assumption about how much stamp duty she had to pay on the
  flat she bought in Hove might be wrong. In controversies like this, ‘who knew
  what, when?’ always becomes a key issue and yesterday Downing Street ducked
  questions about when Keir Starmer first learned there was a problem. Bridget
  Phillipson, the education secretary, was giving interviews this morning, and
  she was more forthcoming about when Rayner was told there was a problem. She
  told the Today programme: My understanding is that, whilst Angela Rayner had
  received some advice on Monday, it was definitively given to her on Wednesday
  that she had made a mistake in terms of the amount of stamp duty that she had
  paid on the purchase. So that was on Wednesday. But there were limitations in
  what she could discuss and disclose, including with others and including in
  public, until that court order [a court order saying she could not discuss
  details of the trust set up for her disabled son, which affected her stamp
  duty liability] had been lifted on Tuesday. In another interview, on Sky News,
  Phillipson said that Rayner received the “original version” of this legal
  advice on Monday, but that it “wasn’t later clarified until the Wednesday”.
  Phillipson has not said when Starmer was first told Rayner may have underpaid
  her stamp duty, but Jason Groves from the Daily Mail thinks the PM would have
  been alerted to this on Monday. Commenting on the Phillipson inteviews, Groves
  said: Given this timeline, it seems very likely that Starmer knew Rayner had
  failed to pay her taxes in full when he defended her in public on Monday
  afternoon and said her critics were making ‘a mistake’ Rayner consulted three
  people before she concluded that she only needed to pay the standard rate of
  stamp duty on her flat purchase, not the higher rate for a second home,
  broadcasters have been briefed. In their BBC story, Billy Kenber and Damian
  Grammaticas report: It is understood the deputy prime minister consulted one
  individual experienced in conveyancing and two experts on the law around
  trusts before the purchase. However, it is unclear if any of those people were
  experts in complex tax law and it is not known if they knew about the full
  details of the trust, which was set up to help fund care for her son. Kevin
  Hollinrake, the Conservative party chair, has written to HM Revenue and
  Customs asking it to investigate whether Rayner was guilty of tax evasion. As
  Sky News reports, Hollinrake said in his letter: Why did [Rayner], or her
  representatives, not take the necessary steps to check with HMRC on whether
  second homes stamp duty was actually payable. This was ‘careless’ at best, and
  did not meet her requirement to act responsibly.” There are legitimate
  questions on whether Ms Rayner could have afforded the property if she had
  been liable for the additional £40,000 in second homes stamp duty, on top of
  the £30,0000 standard stamp duty and the £150,000 downpayment towards the Hove
  flat. This then raises the question whether the tax evasion was deliberate, to
  try to get away with minimising her upfront costs so she could afford her
  £650,000 Natwest mortgage (which is likely to cost in the region £4,000 a
  month to service). Hollinrake also says it should have been obvious to Rayner
  that she did have to pay the higher rate. There will be more on this as the
  day goes on. But it won’t just be Rayner. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am:
  John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, gives a speech on Scottish
  independence. Morning: Keir Starmer participates virtually in a meeting of the
  “Coalition of the Willing”, the European countries offering to guarantee
  Ukraine’s security in the event of a ceasefire. 9.30am: Steve Reed, the
  environment secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: Jeremy Corbyn
  opens his Gaza Tribunal hearings, exploring British complicity in Israel’s
  military operations in Gaza. Morning: Starmer visits a shipyard in Glasgow to
  promote the benefits to Scotland of the government’s deal with Norway to build
  warships. 11am: Peter Kyle, the science secretary, speaks at the Universities
  UK conference. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. Late morning:
  Members of the Stormont executive hold a press conference to give their
  response to the racist attacks that have taken place in Northern Ireland over
  the summer. Afternoon: John Healey, the defence secretary, holds a press
  conference in Norway with his Norwegian counterpart after the signing of the
  warships deal. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line
  when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or
  message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put
  “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search
  for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it
  is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at
  @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its
  official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still
  have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it
  and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out
  mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your
  questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I
  will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.
