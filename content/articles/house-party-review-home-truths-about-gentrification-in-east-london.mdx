  In her solo show about the aftermath of gentrification and austerity, Chakira
  Alin bemoans the rise of costly small plates in restaurants. It’s a neat
  parallel to the housing market, where properties are also getting smaller and
  more expensive. But Alin’s chief metaphor is the “lost art” of the house party
  – indicative of her generation’s financial crisis and a wider crack in social
  cohesion. There’s no space to throw a decent party or the would-be hosts can’t
  risk trashing their precarious, overpriced rentals or family homes. The
  argument is put across with brio and evident authenticity on a homely stage
  decorated with balloons, heart-shaped cushions and a cocktail shaker. Greatly
  at ease with the audience, Alin plays Skip (smart name for a show about
  constant upheaval), born and raised in ever-gentrifying east London where she
  lives with her mum. Skip hearts Hackney, it even says so on her T-shirt, but
  how have we reached the point where dying in the place you’re from may be an
  unreachable dream? Bitterness is shot through a predominantly buoyant show
  with some sparkling sequences: Skip fantasising about “white-pillared
  Georgians” and other desirable addresses; hitting up RightMove as if it’s
  PornHub; finding that the TV series Skins has sold her a lie, and likening
  house parties to oceans while nightclubs are swimming pools. Easy gags about
  gentrification are rife at the Edinburgh fringe but instead Alin gives us an
  inside perspective and a longer view of familiar issues, anticipating the
  hollowing-out when gentrifiers move on. The show also occasionally veers into
  straight standup: “What do they call French windows in France?” But amid the
  bubbling humour, the threat of homelessness for Skip and her mum is a constant
  concern. Alin repeatedly strikes the pose of an analyst, whether explaining
  why Miley Cyrus’s We Can’t Stop should be on every playlist or the function of
  house parties for the Windrush generation. It’s two years since Skip left
  drama school and she gives a lucid account of how her chosen profession is
  similarly weighted against her, also dominated by those benefiting from
  inherited wealth. A subplot about a friend who sleeps rough needs deepening,
  as do a couple of supporting characters. But Alin’s plotting displays a
  skilful sleight of hand and she has charisma to burn in a show packed with
  home truths about dispossession. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25
