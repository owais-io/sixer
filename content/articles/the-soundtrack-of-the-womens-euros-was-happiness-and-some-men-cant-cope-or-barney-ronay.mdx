  “You can’t stand their voices? ALL women’s voices?” “Yes.” “Are you married to
  a woman?” “I am. And she feels the same.” Hmm. To be fair to Dave from Egham,
  whose name has been changed to protect the confused, the whole setup here was
  pretty bleak. It was Dave’s destiny a week on from England’s victory at Euro
  2025 to find himself going viral after an appearance on LBC radio. In the clip
  Dave objects to the sound of all women’s voices, even if they’re Adele or
  Billie Holiday. Specifically he objects to women talking about women’s sport,
  which Dave hates because it is being thrown down his throat, and thrown down
  his throat to the extent he has to ring up a radio station and talk about the
  women talking about the women’s sport, simply to disentangle its tendrils from
  his throat, to steal a few gargling, sputtering final breaths. What are we
  supposed to do with this? In Ernst Gombrich’s A Little History of the World,
  which is the best history of the world even when it’s wrong, he suggests that
  language evolved because humans were driven by the ice age into caves, forced
  to find ways of sharing social spaces, that this miracle of industry,
  sociability, turnip production schemes, and ultimately beauty, poetry and
  abstract thought, evolved out of a closeness driven by basic human survival.
  You feel a bit for the cave-human in this context. What have we done with this
  miracle of human connection? Two million years on, here we are on a radio
  station designed solely to mainline endless gabbling voices into your
  weepingly overstuffed consciousness, listening to a man talking in an endless
  gabbling voice about how the endless gabbling voices torture him, although
  only voices with undescended larynx folds describing sport, as agreed with by
  Mrs Dave, who is definitely not a broom handle with a wig and a pair of yellow
  rubber gloves. And yes, it is easy to laugh at Dave, although not perhaps to
  dismiss him completely. In part because he isn’t even the least sympathetic
  person in the clip. That role is occupied by the host, who looks like what
  happens when a pomegranate with a notably overblown sense of self-regard has
  somehow grown a goatee and worked out how to sit in a chair, and who clearly
  knows he has a live one on his hook, that this is rage-content gold, and who
  reels Dave in like a mutant farmed salmon. But also because while Dave’s pain
  may be misguided and unprocessed it is also telling us an interesting thing
  about all this. I got to watch the Euros as a fan, a rare pleasure when you
  work as a reporter. It was really fun, a chance just to enjoy the games and
  get to know the players and support whoever was good. The standard was high.
  The women’s game at this level has distinctive patterns, a pass-and-move
  sport, a business of close angles and sudden transitions. Often the matches
  were two or three things at once like an English summer’s day, ranging in a
  single sitting from slick zippy combinations, to endurance-race wrestle, to
  shootout drama. The TV coverage was good. The whole thing has calmed down from
  the early days of being forced to justify its existence, the cult-like vibe
  where everyone has to be inspirational all the time and the studio chat could
  feel like an evangelical church coffee morning. The pundits were agreeably
  cutting when England stumbled. Ellen White is just a really good analyst.
  Nedum Onuoha was an excellent selection. It was very easy to get lost in it
  all. Even if, after a while, there was a sense of absence, a missing static
  field, a tonal difference that Dave does identify, albeit incorrectly. The
  missing noise here was: noise, the familiar sounds of rage, pain and betrayal.
  Instead the tone of the women’s Euros was happiness. The players were
  courteous. Nobody hated anyone else. England wished Spain well on the eve of
  the final. Mainly it was all just seductively unencumbered, operating in its
  own energy field, a pitch that became more distinct as the endless gurgle of
  the Premier League reasserted itself this week. And yes, the klaxon is
  sounding here. Don’t define women’s sport by men’s sport! But what about the
  other way round? Because the Euros also illuminated something about men’s
  sport that feels both blindingly obvious and a little strange in its own
  right. Why is men’s football defined so powerfully by rage and pain? Why does
  it reach for these emotions reflexively at every turn? This, I believe is what
  Dave is really talking about. He doesn’t find women’s sport alien because the
  voices are women’s voices. He finds it strange because they’re happy, because
  they’re not talking about the usual things, reaching for that hammy old
  emotional compass. Is it real if it doesn’t hurt? The women’s Euros seemed
  able to operate without this burden of history. Even victory in a big
  tournament was a joyful thing, not a grimacing, howling assertion of some lost
  sporting identity. Nobody was being flame-throwered here, no hurt expunged.
  For those of us afflicted with that endless backbeat of fear and rage it was
  like the moment the free jazz quartet in the corner of the bar stops playing
  and suddenly you just get to enjoy your cocktail. The fact is men do sometimes
  love to fetishise their own pain, their capacity for powerful emotions, to
  create a sense of quest. Men’s sport has been defined by longing,
  disappointment, catharsis. This is its cultural heritage. Men like to yearn,
  to feel tribal. What do I have without my minor chords, my bruises? This
  vision of winning demands wounds, a narrative of redemption. The Southgate-era
  men’s team confronted this by falling into a state of premature enragement
  when it looked like victory might actually be possible. Stop winning wrong.
  Win more English. And, yes, none of this makes sense in outline. Heroic men
  aren’t tortured by female voices talking about sport. John Wayne isn’t
  storming out of the living room because Gabby Logan is on. But then nothing
  really adds up about the Dave-style objections to women’s sport receiving
  coverage. Dave says women’s football is being thrown down his throat. Well,
  maybe, but everything is being thrown down your throat. Men’s football, the
  bacon double whopper, walk-in baths, the car that won’t make you happy. We
  live in a down-your-throat culture. Why is a few weeks of women playing a
  ballgame a problem? And not, for example, Pringles or Nigel Farage. There is
  the objection that women’s football is parasitic on men’s football, that it is
  not yet commercially self-sufficient. Who cares? This is what growth is. You
  invest. Currently men’s football is subsidising iffy agents, supercars and
  money laundering. Why should it not also fund something that’s going to make
  people kick a ball, be active, feel pleased? What else is sport for, if not
  that? And this is commercially sensible growth, growth that doesn’t destroy
  stuff or distort existing leagues or glorify Gianni Infantino. There are no
  disbenefits to women’s sport being allowed to grow, nothing bad you can point
  to. Which is fine. But how are we supposed to cope with that? Some parts of
  the football media have done their best to contort success at the Euros into a
  more recognisable shape. England won by digging in and being determined. Yes,
  this is how we beat foreigners now. With will and spirit and traditional
  values. Sarina Wiegman as wing-commander Charles Reep, Chloe Kelly as the
  evacuation of Dunkirk. Lucy Bronze and Stuart Pearce, every single one of
  their limbs broken, standing on the Dover cliffs, waving a single flapping
  femur in salute to the skies, Does this work? Can we run with it? Really,
  though, it is simply a process of accommodation. What Dave from Egham is
  really telling us is that the time is now past where it’s worth broadcasting
  this stuff. It is simply rage in the dark. It will pass. More vital right now
  is that sense of clarity around the women’s team, of something existing in its
  own clean, clear square of light. Can it be preserved? This England group is
  at a perfect stage in many ways, halfway in and halfway out of its own period
  of growth. There are still players there who came up in the old days of
  bandaging their own strains and getting buses to training. There will of
  course be a fall, a time where there is nostalgia for the current success. But
  there is also a chance here to subvert this paradigm, to retain that sense of
  connection, of a victory that felt like happiness not vindication, pleasure
  not the release from pain, and that was carried to us by women’s voices. Do
