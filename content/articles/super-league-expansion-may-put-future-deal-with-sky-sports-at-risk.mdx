  Super League’s long-term partnership with Sky Sports that bankrolls the sport
  could be jeopardised by plans to expand the competition to 14 teams next
  season. The existing 12 Super League clubs voted in favour of expansion this
  week following the recommendations of a strategic review led by the Rugby
  Football League chair, Nigel Wood, but the Guardian has learned that the plan
  has yet to be endorsed by their broadcast partner. Under the terms of the
  current deal, Sky broadcasts every Super League game live, but it is
  understood that the cost of televising an extra game across 27 rounds next
  year would be about £500,000. The Guardian has been told Sky is reluctant to
  pick up the additional cost for matches it did not buy in a tender process
  that concluded almost two years ago, and has no intention of increasing its
  rights fees to support two extra clubs. Sky’s three-year deal to provide
  exclusive live coverage of Super League enters its final 12 months next
  season, and while there is no suggestion of the broadcaster terminating that
  contract, senior sources have indicated that the expansion could affect
  negotiations over future deals. RL Commercial officials are understood to have
  been locked in discussions with Sky since the vote on Monday about what
  expansion means for the existing contract, and have yet to receive the
  reassurances they are seeking. Sky has been Super League’s broadcast partner
  since the competition launched in 1996 and around 170 games will be shown live
  this season, but the value of the contract has dropped significantly in recent
  years. Officials who were present at the meeting at Headingley that approved
  expansion have privately admitted that one of their big concerns was how the
  broadcaster would react to the decision, as well as how the extra games will
  be financed. Super League clubs are receiving a total of £21.5m from Sky this
  year compared with £40m in 2021. The comparison with other sports is also
  alarming, with their £21.5m rights fee less than Sky pays to televise just
  three Premier League games, while the broadcaster is investing around £20m a
  year in the Women’s Super League from next season in rights fees and
  production costs. Sky’s declining financial backing for rugby league is a
  major concern for the sport as it prepares to enter the final year of its TV
  deal, particularly given the limited interest from elsewhere and how reliant
  rugby league is on its income from the Sky Sports contract. TNT Sports made a
  speculative offer for the current rights, but it has since spent £200m on a
  new five-year deal for Premiership Rugby so may not bid again. IMG, the sports
  marketing agency that manages the grading process which determines Super
  League membership, is leading a tender process for the next broadcast cycle
  beginning in 2027. Sky declined to comment, but one source at the broadcaster
  said that rugby league was fighting for its future. In another complication,
  Sky also broadcasts Australia’s National Rugby League, which has held talks
  about buying a 33% stake in Super League but made clear it sees it as a
  10-team competition. Sources in Australia have indicated expansion to 14 teams
  effectively kills any hope of direct investment into Super League in the near
  future. With no additional TV money forthcoming after expansion, the Super
  League clubs have also yet to decide how the extra two teams will be funded
  next season. A number of clubs are understood to have argued strongly that
  they will not accept a cut in their own central payments from the Sky deal.
  Some Championship clubs vying for promotion as part of expansion plans have
  indicated they would be willing to enter the competition with no central
  distribution for one season in 2026. Such a move would expose newly promoted
  clubs to potential financial risk, as well as raise further concerns about the
  Super League’s competitiveness. Financially troubled Salford were thrashed
  82-0 by St Helens at the start of the season, and have conceded 50 points on
  two more occasions. As reported by the Guardian, Hull FC and Hull KR voted
  against expansion in a meeting at Headingley on Monday, while Wigan abstained
  amid confusion over the criteria to be used by the RFL panel which will select
  the two extra teams for next season’s competition.
