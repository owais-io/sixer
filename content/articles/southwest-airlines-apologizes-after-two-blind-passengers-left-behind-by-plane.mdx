  The US’s Southwest Airlines has publicly apologized after two women who are
  blind were both left behind by a plane flying to Orlando that the pair
  evidently should have had the opportunity to be on. Southwest eventually ended
  up flying the women, Camille Tate and Sherri Brun, on another flight for which
  they were the only two passengers, with the rest being rebooked on a plane
  that left earlier, according to recent reporting from the Orlando news
  stations WSVN and WOFL. Nonetheless, as WSVN noted, the two friends from
  Florida remained outraged at their experience, which resulted from their not
  being able to see information about the rebooked flight and not being verbally
  notified of the switch by the airline. “The way they help their customers
  [who] require additional assistance needs to change,” Brun told the outlet.
  Tate added: “There needs to be some improvement in how they communicate with
  passengers, especially those that have disabilities.” Brun and Tate booked
  themselves to take flight 2637 from New Orleans to Orlando on 14 July, and it
  was delayed by five hours. They waited at their original gate for the duration
  of the delay and then realized they were the only passengers on the flight
  when they boarded. According to Brun, she and Tate were told: “You’re the only
  two people on this flight because they forgot about you.” A statement from a
  Southwest spokesperson explained that nearly all of Brun and Tate’s would-be
  fellow passengers were rebooked on another of the airline’s flights that left
  to Orlando earlier from a nearby gate. Neither Brun nor Tate were rebooked on
  that earlier flight, and the friends said they had no idea it was even an
  option because – without sight – they never saw information related to
  rebooking. “Nobody … told us anything,” Brun said, according to WSVN and WOFL.
  “Nobody came to get us … The time passed.” Tate reportedly remarked: “That
  airplane took off and our boarding pass had not been swiped.” The two friends
  said they took their unique flight story to the media to raise awareness about
  something that could happen to other similarly situated passengers unless the
  airline implements changes. Southwest’s statement said it had offered Brun and
  Tate each a $100 voucher, explaining how they were not eligible for a full
  refund because they had completed their originally scheduled flight. “We
  apologize for the inconvenience,” the statement continued. “Southwest is
  always looking for ways to improve our customers’ travel experiences, and
  we’re active in the airline industry in sharing best practices about how to
  best accommodate passengers with disabilities.”
