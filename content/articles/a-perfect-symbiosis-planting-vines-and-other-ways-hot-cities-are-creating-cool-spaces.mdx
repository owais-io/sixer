  As Spain takes a breath after yet another brutal summer heatwave, with
  temperatures above 40C in many parts of the country, the residents of the
  sherry-making town of Jerez de la Frontera have come up with a novel way to
  keep the streets cool. Green canopies of grapevines festoon the town, reducing
  street-level temperatures by as much as 8C. “We’re planting vines in the old
  city because we hope that in two or three years we’ll be able to brag that
  this has put an end to stifling temperatures,” said Jesús Rodríguez, president
  of Los Emparrados, a group of residents who aim to beautify and green the
  city’s streets. For decades the local sherry producers have kept their
  wineries cool with emparradors (vine arbours) but now the practice has been
  extended to a cluster of streets in the old town. Not only are vines part of
  the essence of Jerez, they also have several advantages over trees. They need
  to be watered only in the first two years and they are deciduous, letting in
  the winter sun between November and March. Within three years of planting they
  will form a complete canopy over a narrow street. Just a single vine stem
  growing up the side of a house can offer a lot of shade. In the sherry houses,
  where this has been the practice for more than 60 years, the leaves from a
  single vine form a canopy of 60 sq metres. The variety chosen is Vitus riparia
  which does not produce grapes, avoiding streets made sticky by fallen fruit.
  “There’s a perfect symbiosis in that by planting vines in the street we’re
  doing something for the city as well as celebrating the vines of Jerez. Our
  philosophy is closely linked to Jerez vines,” said Begoña García
  González-Gordon, of Los Emparrados. Now the local authority plans to extend
  the canopy from the four streets in the pilot scheme to 20, linking the 14
  parks and green spaces in the old city over an area of 1.5 sq miles (4 sq km).
  In the Andalusian town of Alhaurín de la Torre, 125 miles east of Jerez, the
  streets are shaded under a canopy of colourful crocheted blankets. This is
  another community initiative, the work of Eva Pacheco, a local crochet
  teacher, and her students, and provides shade over an area of 500 sq metres.
  La Calle de las Mandalas is a similar crochet project in the Andalusian town
  of La Línea de la Concepción, but instead of squares the canopy consists of
  860 round mandalas joined together. The mandalas are the work of the La Línea
  Association of Crocheters. In many Spanish streets and squares, shade is
  provided by sheets of canvas stretched between poles of buildings. In Calle
  Santa María in Valladolid, in north-west Spain, residents have taken this a
  step further, creating a series of awnings planted with gypsophila and other
  plants that are slung on cables between buildings, providing shade and hanging
  gardens. Cities around the world are finding novel ways to confront the
  problem of rising temperatures. Paris has created an app pointing to an
  interlinked network of 800 “cool islands”, from parks and forests to swimming
  pools and museums. The islands are for the most part linked by cool walkways,
  and the idea is that no one is more than seven minutes from a cool oasis. The
  Colombian city of Medellín has succeeded in bringing temperatures down by two
  degrees through a series of 30 green corridors consisting of vertical gardens,
  plants and about 1m trees. The scheme also improves air quality and is
  starting to attract wildlife back to the city. However, shade is not the only
  way of cooling the city. The Andalusian capital, Seville, a region that is
  bearing the brunt of climate breakdown, has revived an ancient Persian
  technique, the qanat, as a form of outdoor air conditioning. The
  3,000-year-old technique, used throughout the Middle East, traditionally
  consists of diverting cool mountain water through underground channels, which
  are perforated at intervals to cool the surrounding air. The Cartuja qanat
  project in Seville is based at an abandoned amphitheatre on the island of
  Cartuja in the Guadalquivir River, the site of Expo ’92, much of which has
  fallen into disuse. Partially funded by the EU, the €5m (£4.3m) project uses
  solar energy to drive water through deep underground channels. Underground,
  air captured at 40C cools to around 17C. Vertical vents along the canal drive
  the cool air around the water upwards, reducing the ground temperature. At
  night, some water is pumped up on to the roof where it cascades down solar
  panels, cooling in the night air, before returning underground. During the
  day, solar-powered pumps push the cooled water above ground, where it is
  funnelled through small pipes on to fans that spray the cool air into the
  ground floor of the amphitheatre, while a separate set of nozzles spray water
  mist into the air. Further cooling is provided by shade trees and by painting
  the roof of the auditorium white to reflect sunlight. These elements have
  combined to reduce air temperature in the area by 6-7C and there are plans to
  replicate the qanat scheme in other parts of the city.
