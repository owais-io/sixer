  Those who misled the country over Brexit are usually quieter these days. They
  do not hang their heads in shame, but change the subject whenever they can.
  They deflect with their new war-cry that Britain must also leave the European
  convention on human rights. As the effects of their wicked Brexit folly worsen
  by the month, they rarely get a chance to whoop: “We were right!” So their
  glee was unrestrained when the great US global bully gave Britain a less hard
  beating with a 10% tariff on its goods, compared with the EU, which was
  walloped with 15%. Their joy overflowed when the business and trade secretary,
  Jonathan Reynolds, conceded: “I’m absolutely clear, this is a benefit of being
  out of the European Union, having our independent trade policy, absolutely no
  doubt about that.” But what else can a trade secretary, speaking through
  gritted teeth, actually say? In his attempts to attract foreign investment, he
  can hardly tell the truth about the damage done by leaving the EU. These
  advocates of Brexit should gloat while they can. When the French prime
  minister called the EU’s deal with Donald Trump a “soumission” (submission),
  Kwasi Kwarteng seized on the word in a piece for the Telegraph, writing: “For
  the French, with their memories of capitulation to the Nazis in 1940, the word
  is even more associated with abject humiliation than it is in English.” Yes,
  that’s the same Kwarteng who hurled the British economy over a cliff only
  three years ago. “This trade deal is the EU’s greatest humiliation since
  Britain voted to leave”, read the headline on his column. But he would never
  confess that the difference between a 10% and 15% tariff with the US is
  minimal, since we trade twice as much with the EU as the US. It barely equates
  to the regular variation in exchange rates: in other words, it’s “a rounding
  error”, the Centre for European Reform’s trade expert, John Springford, told
  me, when compared with the hammer blow Britain gave itself with Brexit. The
  UK-India trade deal signed with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, last
  week was greeted with another Brexiter whoop from the Conservative peer Daniel
  Hannan. Also writing in the Telegraph, he said: “My party, and Brexiteers more
  widely, should be taking credit for having done what all the clever Europhiles
  have spent six years telling us was impossible. Instead of moaning, we should
  welcome Starmer’s belated understanding that world’s biggest and
  fastest-growing markets are outside the EU.” But the Tory leader took another
  view: “Keir Starmer called this ‘historic.’ It’s not historic, we’ve just been
  shafted!” Kemi Badenoch said, dismissing the India agreement as a bad deal
  that would increase immigration. I don’t know whether clever men like Kwarteng
  and Hannan are blinded by Brexit monomania or paralysed by the awful knowledge
  of the damage they have inflicted on their country, unable to confess an act
  of treachery and delusion hardly matched in British history. But as ever,
  facts are too inconvenient for them to deal with. Yes, the India deal is the
  biggest and most substantial trade deal since leaving the EU. Yes, it’s a deal
  that would have been impossible to do from inside the union. But how big is
  it? It will add 0.13% to our economy. That’s better than the Australia
  agreement, worth just 0.08%, the New Zealand deal, worth 0.03%, or the
  proposed US agreement, worth 0.16%, according to Department for Business and
  Trade analysis. But our fragile economy needs all the help it can get, so
  hurrah for Brexit and our new trade deals! But the gloaters ignore the
  context: our great Brexit losses. Here’s the Office for Budget
  Responsibility’s assessment: “Our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK
  imports and exports will both be 15% lower than if we had remained in the EU.”
  That 15% loss in trade “will lead to a 4% reduction in the potential
  productivity of the UK economy”. In other words, as Jonty Bloom of the New
  World calculates, we need 50 India trade deals to make up for Brexit, because
  Britain does more than 40% of its trade with the EU – more if you include the
  European Economic Area and Switzerland. India has just 2% of our trade.
  Brexiters bleat that Labour is sneaking us into the EU by the back door, with
  deals on Horizon, the EU’s research and innovation funding programme; soon,
  hopefully, Erasmus; and maybe a youth experience scheme. We hope for
  agricultural products and energy deals. But even these, say the trade experts,
  are still small potatoes. Major attempts to rescue Britain’s 4% loss in
  productivity since 2020 hit the concrete walls of Boris Johnson’s monumentally
  bad trade and cooperation agreement. Brexit zealots protest against agreements
  to keep a dynamic alignment with EU standards that would make trade easier.
  But it doesn’t apply to our internal environmental standards: outside EU
  rules, we have let our water quality fall behind the EU. More than 85% of
  bathing waters in the EU are rated excellent compared with just 64% in the UK,
  with the gap rising every year, reports the European Movement. Public opinion
  has shifted rapidly: we are now a “Bregretful” country, where only 31% still
  think it was right to leave and 61% say Brexit has been more of a failure than
  a success. Who do they blame? The Conservatives and Boris Johnson are top of
  the list, with 88% and 84% respectively holding them responsible. More than
  two-thirds (67%) blame Nigel Farage. A majority of Britons (56%) want to
  rejoin the EU as the grim reaper carries off old Brexiters, replacing them
  with young, pro-European voters. Don’t expect bolder moves from the Labour
  government in its current frame of mind. Though defence and security draw us
  towards ever closer union, public opinion is not to be trusted. If people were
  confronted now with actual re-entry terms – paying in, free movement, joining
  the euro, no special deals – their answers might change. The mood might also
  be different if the far right continues its gains in EU countries, dividing
  the union’s values. What might it take to throw off the economic, political
  and psychological darkness of Brexit? A clever – or Cleverly? – new Tory
  leader daring to break with the past, confessing the error of Brexit and
  taking us back into the EU, once and for all. It may take another generation
  to recover. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist
