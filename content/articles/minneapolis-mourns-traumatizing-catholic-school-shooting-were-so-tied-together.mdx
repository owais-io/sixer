  A young man carrying white flowers approached a police line a block away from
  the church and school on Wednesday where hours earlier an assailant opened
  fire on schoolchildren, blasting bullets through stained glass windows and
  killing two kids. Arthur Louie grew up a few blocks away from Annunciation
  church in south Minneapolis, Minnesota. The church throws a fair before school
  starts, he said, describing it as a “staple point in this community”. He was
  devastated to hear about the shooting, holding back tears as he said he wanted
  to bring flowers to pay his respects. He did not attend the school, but has
  many friends connected to it and described the neighborhood as tight-knit.
  “It’s everything. We’re so tied together. Block parties are huge. The
  community here just gets along so well,” he said. “Something like this
  happens, it doesn’t matter what our beliefs are, we’re going to band
  together.” Louie kneeled at a stoplight pole outside the police line, pulling
  the flowers from their plastic and placing them on the ground, starting a
  makeshift vigil. The assailant, identified by police as Robin Westman, killed
  themself as well. Police said Wednesday they are investigating any potential
  motives and executing search warrants related to the shooter. FBI director
  Kash Patel said the bureau is “investigating this shooting as an act of
  domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”. In addition to the two
  children killed, 14 children and three adults were injured. Yellow police tape
  lined the block, preventing people from walking up to the church. News cameras
  gathered, swarming to get video footage of elected officials and police
  vehicles moving around the site. A Red Cross van, with a red tent beside it,
  handed out snacks and water. White tents sat outside the church. Men wearing
  shirts that said “Chaplain” in yellow letters were on site, one wearing an “I
  ♥ Jesus” hat. Neighbors walking by the police line to get groceries at a
  nearby Kowalski’s Markets or walking their dogs stopped to look at the scene,
  some making calls to loved ones or snapping photos. The school is near a main
  road and commercial area. After one woman walked beside the police line, she
  said: “It just makes you sick.” Armored vehicles and tactical vans and police
  SUVs with their lights flashing lined the streets outside the church.
  Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara said at an afternoon press conference
  that dozens of police officers responded to the scene and now are grappling
  with what they witnessed. “Many of them are deeply traumatized by what they
  saw as are, obviously, all of the children, all of the staff members …
  everyone who is at mass this morning,” O’Hara said. The school shooting is the
  fourth shooting within 24 hours in the city. It comes less than three months
  after the targeted killings of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband,
  Mark. The shooting, at a church beside Catholic school, has shaken this
  community. Two places of sanctuary – a learning environment, a spiritual home
  – were attacked, puncturing a sense of safety. Neighbors who heard gunshots
  ran out of their homes to help. Parents ran to the school to find their kids
  on Wednesday morning. One neighborhood group set up a relief station outside
  this afternoon for people to stop by, chat and commune with each other amid
  the tragedy. Bishop Harding Smith, a pastor and anti-violence advocate, was at
  the scene, standing outside the police line. “Because of what has happened
  today, our young boys and girls are going to be afraid to even come to school.
  They’re going to be afraid to leave the home. All they keep hearing echoing is
  the sound of the bullets and emergency vehicles, it causes trauma.” A student
  who was inside the church during the shooting told local TV news channel Fo x9
  that a friend was laying on top of him to protect him, and his friend was hit.
  Weston Halsne told the outlet that the shooting was “super scary” and that the
  students had not practiced active shooter drills in the church, just in the
  school. The school’s principal, Matt DeBoer, addressed his school community in
  a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, telling them: “I love you, you’re
  so brave, and I’m so sorry this happened to us today.” Teachers and students
  were heroes to one another, he said. The school lost “two angels”. He implored
  people to commit to making sure no other community, school, person has to
  experience what his school experienced today. “I beg you,” he said. “I ask you
  to please pray, but don’t stop with your words. Let’s make a difference and
  support this community’s children, these families, these teachers. Never again
  can we let this happen.”
