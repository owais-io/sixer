  The Guardian view on the dental divide: ministers must brush up their policy
  as well as children’s teeth | Editorial

  Disadvantaged primary school pupils at the government’s first wave of new
  breakfast clubs can expect to be trained in toothbrushing, as well as fed.
  Data showing that a fifth of all five-year-olds in England have experienced
  tooth decay persuaded ministers to make improved oral health part of the early
  years and reception class curriculum. But the prevalence of decay is not
  evenly spread across the country. And research showing how much worse the
  situation is for children in deprived areas is in line with other findings
  about widening health inequalities. New analysis from the Local Government
  Association highlights the differing availability of dental care across
  council areas – a situation sometimes described as a dental divide. It found
  no specific correlation between the numbers of NHS dentists and young children
  with tooth decay. But it adds to a body of research showing that people in
  poorer areas are generally less well provided for. In Middlesbrough, for
  example, there are just 10 NHS dental practices per 100,000 people, while in
  wealthy Richmond upon Thames there are 28. Health inequalities are, of course,
  nothing new. Ensuring a more equitable distribution of healthcare – one of the
  greatest of all social goods – was Labour’s aim when setting up the National
  Health Service in the first place. But as the number of people living in deep
  poverty has increased, while healthcare costs and expectations have risen,
  disparities in health experiences and outcomes between people from different
  socioeconomic backgrounds have become more starkly apparent. This includes a
  widening gap in life expectancies. Deprivation is not clearly related to the
  provision of all NHS services. Data on diagnostic waits suggests a fairly even
  picture across England (since health is devolved, data in Scotland, Wales and
  Northern Ireland is captured separately). But along with A&amp;E admissions,
  which are nearly twice as high in the poorest communities, dentistry is an
  area in which geographical differences are troubling – and all the more so
  given well‑established links between poverty and other diet-related health
  problems, including obesity. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has pledged
  to reform the dental contract within this parliament, and introduce a “tie-in”
  obliging dentists trained in the UK to work in the NHS for three years after
  qualifying. But it is hard to see how services in deprived areas will be
  improved unless funding for NHS dentistry is increased to the point where
  practices are viable without the cross‑subsidy provided by private patients.
  Currently, dentists’ reliance on fees is a strong incentive to work in areas
  with plenty of such patients. The shift of £2.2bn of NHS spending to poorer
  parts of the country, announced by the government in June, should make a
  difference to dentistry as well as health overall. But if gaps both in access
  and outcomes are to be narrowed, then funding for dentistry will need to be
  prioritised. Evidence so far suggests only modest take-up of a “golden hello”
  scheme of one‑off payments to reward dentists setting up practices in
  underserved areas. A parallel scheme to address localised GP shortages is at
  risk of being cut. A far higher proportion of dentistry than healthcare
  overall is delivered in the private sector. Another lesson to be drawn from
  “dental deserts” is about what happens when market forces, and not
  democratically accountable policymakers, are in charge. Do you have an opinion
