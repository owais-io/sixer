  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged his allies to bring about “regime change” in
  Russia, hours after a Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv killed 26
  people including three children. The Ukrainian president said he believed
  Russia could be “pushed” to stop the war. “But if the world doesn’t aim to
  change the regime in Russia, that means even after the war ends, Moscow will
  still try to destabilise neighbouring countries,” he said on Thursday,
  speaking virtually to a conference marking the 50th anniversary of the cold
  war-era Helsinki accords. Russia’s overnight strikes wounded at least 150
  people, authorities said. The death toll previously stood at 16, including two
  children, but was revised on Friday after rescuers retrieved 10 bodies from
  the rubble of a residential building in the Sviatoshynsky district, including
  the body of a two-year-old child, according to the interior ministry. Russia
  fired more than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles at Ukraine – with Kyiv
  the main target – from late Wednesday to early Thursday, the Ukrainian air
  force said. One missile tore through a nine-storey residential building in the
  capital’s west, ripping off its facade, authorities said. Zelenskyy said the
  injured including 16 children and six police officers. It was the largest
  number of children hurt in a single attack on Kyiv during the war, the rescue
  service said. Donald Trump criticised Russia’s actions in Ukraine, suggesting
  new sanctions against Moscow were coming. “Russia – I think it’s disgusting
  what they’re doing,” the US president said on Thursday. “We’re going to put
  sanctions,” he said, before adding: “I don’t know that sanctions bother him,”
  referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s attack came just days
  after Trump issued a 10-to-12-day ultimatum for Moscow to halt its invasion or
  face sanctions. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a law restoring
  independence to two anti-corruption bodies, essentially annulling another law
  adopted last week that prompted the biggest street protests since Russia’s
  full-scale invasion three years ago, reports Shaun Walker. Several hundred
  protesters outside the parliament building in Kyiv erupted into chants of “the
  people are the power” as the bill passed on Thursday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will
  hope the new law will put an end to what had threatened to become a political
  crisis domestically and had worried European allies. He signed the law into
  force swiftly after the vote. Russia claimed on Thursday that it had captured
  the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar, a strategically important military hub in
  the eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy called Moscow’s claim “Russian
  disinformation”, saying: “Ukrainian units are defending our positions.”
  Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko said Russian forces “have full
  control over the entire northern and eastern part” of Chasiv Yar, including
  districts that had been hardest to get. But he said fighting for the western
  side was ongoing, with the situation “very difficult”. The battlefields
  reports could not be independently verified.
