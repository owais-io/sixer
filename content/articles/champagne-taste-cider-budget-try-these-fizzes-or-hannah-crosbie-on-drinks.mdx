  Bad news for me: I turn 28 this week, and I don’t feel particularly wiser. I
  do feel older, though. So, as you read this, you can be sure that I am
  probably quite drunk on sparkling wine. There’s scarcely a better excuse than
  a birthday, but I think we can agree that what you’re likely to be drinking at
  any such event will vary greatly, depending on whether or not the birthday in
  question is your own. It’s always good to start off with something sparkling,
  which is why, for the past few years, I’ve treated myself to a bottle of
  Billecart-Salmon in bed, but I think I might try something a bit different
  this year. My mind turns to Sip Champagnes, an independent, online retailer
  that connects consumers with the grower champagnes of the region. It even has
  a sub-£45 section, which, considering that many of the grandes marques are now
  pushing or exceeding £50 (eek!), provides a chance to taste something new for
  the same price or even less than usual. Or, for even less, there’s crémant,
  which is basically for when you’re having people over and buying en masse.
  Crémant is sparkling wine made in the same méthode traditonelle (traditional
  method) as champagne, during which the wine undergoes two fermentations to
  make it sparkling. An initial base wine is made and fermented into a dry wine,
  then, in a process known as tirage, yeast and sugar are added to kickstart a
  secondary fermentation, after which the wine is sealed with a crown cap. This
  secondary fermentation creates CO₂ (for the bubbles) and lees (spent yeast
  cells), which collect in the neck and give the wine its trademark biscuity
  flavour. These are then frozen and lifted off the top, at which point the
  bottle is sealed with the cork and cage we associate with sparkling wines.
  It’s the same method as champagne, but crémant costs far, far less. Or how
  about something completely different? As I explored in a column earlier this
  year, fine sparkling cider is fast becoming my “why the hell not?” item for
  moments that demand marking with a coupe of something wonderful. “Like
  winemaking, correct terroir and climate are essential ingredients for fine
  cider-making,” says Nick Showering of Showerings Cider. “You can blend
  vintages in a similar way to champagne to achieve a house style, and that’s
  something even the sommeliers at the likes of L’Enclume are now pouring.” And
  while cider certainly still has some catching up to do with champagne, I don’t
  see why it can’t be enjoyed in similar contexts. Swig it from the bottle in
  bed while opening your presents, or pour it into an oyster. Roll on 28. Four
  bottles worthy of any celebration Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Crémant de
  Loire £12.50 (or £11 with a Nectar card), 12%. Perfectly serviceable crémant
  that’s a good option in a pinch. Crémant d’Alsace Extra Brut Prestige, Domaine
  Paul Ginglinger 2022 £15.50 The Wine Society, 12.5%. A favourite producer from
  last year’s trip to Alsace. Bright orchard fruit with a clean finish.
  Showerings Triple Vintage Cider 6x375ml £30 for 6 x 375ml bottles) Showerings
  Cider Mill, 6.8%. A blend of three vintages (2021, 2018 and 2017) creates a
  dry, complex cider. Remy Lequeux-Mercier G4.2 NV £37 Sip Champagnes, 12%. A
  blanc de noirs that’s unusually predominantly pinot meunier. Persistent and
  nutty.
