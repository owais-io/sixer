  I wake to the peal of church bells as sunlight streams into my room and go out
  on to the balcony to look up at Mount Storžič. My base, Senkova Domačija, an
  organic family-run farm just outside the village of Jezersko, is so
  picturesque it looks like an AI hallucination: an ancient farmhouse with
  beautiful wooden outbuildings, cows grazing in small green fields, organic
  vegetables growing neatly in rows, and a backdrop of some seriously dramatic
  mountains. The Slovenian capital Ljubljana may be less than an hour away, but
  here in the Jezersko valley, just 3 miles from the Austrian border, it feels
  like another world. Bordered on the east by the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, and on
  the west by the peaks of the Karavanke mountain range, and with a tranquil
  green lake at the bottom of the valley, there’s a tangible sense of apartness
  – an idyllic escape from the world. Before being confiscated by the communists
  in 1947, the farm had been in the same family for more than 500 years. It was
  returned in 2005 and passed down to current owner, Polona, by her grandmother.
  Today, three generations of her family live here and it’s very much a working
  farm as well as a place to stay. There’s camping in the meadow under the ash
  trees in summer (bring your own tent), parking for caravans and a choice of
  simple rooms and self-catering apartments in the farm buildings. Mine, up in
  the attic of the ancient farmhouse, has been restored using reclaimed wood.
  Resident goats, two big dogs, cats and chickens wander free-range, and
  Jezersko–Solčava sheep graze in the fields – though in summer they are taken
  up to the alpine pastures. It’s all very eco. Water comes from a glacier,
  heating is generated by wood chips from trees felled in the local forest, and
  all food is organic and grown on site (three polytunnels mean vegetables are
  harvested year-round). With the addition of new solar panels, the farm hopes
  to be fully self-sustaining next year. Volunteers return time and again to
  help out in exchange for food and accommodation. Peggy and Pat Rebol, who’ve
  come from the US for the third time, tell me: “This place is magic, it’s not
  only the lake and the valley, it’s the people – this family captured our
  hearts and all we want to do is keep coming back.” I’ve come here to hike, so
  after a breakfast of meats and cheeses, homemade yoghurt and freshly collected
  eggs, I set out with Drejc Karničar, Polona’s husband (who also happens to be
  mayor of Jezersko’s 700 inhabitants). As we walk through forest towards the
  mountains, Drejc points out a rare “golden shoes” orchid at the edge of the
  wood. I’m not much of a botanist but this delightful plant lives up to its
  name – each yellow flower looks exactly like a Cinderella shoe. “They only
  bloom for 14 days,” says Drejc, “you’re lucky.” We make our way up to Češka
  koča (the Czech hut), a mountain lodge that was named Slovenia’s “hut of the
  year” in 2024. You can stay overnight or just grab a hearty lunch on the way
  up the mountain (the hut is open June to September; book by phone on +386 4028
  3300). These high alpine slopes are where Drejc drives his sheep to graze for
  the summer. They used to go to a different pasture, he tells me, but that was
  on the bears’ commuting path and “those bears had a party”. The hike up feels
  like an Indiana Jones obstacle course, with wire cables screwed into the sheer
  mountain sides, wooden bridges and at one point a ladder across the rock.
  Drejc comes up to check on the sheep once a week in summer and brings them
  salt, essential to their diet. The next day, I set my sights on summiting
  Velika Baba, known locally as Mount Baba, about 15 minutes’ drive from the
  farm. This is a far more demanding climb, so I’m accompanied by expert
  mountain guide Tomo Česen. As we walk through the forest and climb towards the
  summit vibrant blue alpine flowers are strewn across the rocks, and purple
  heather borders the trail. There are no cables and the exposed ridge is
  slightly terrifying. I’m roped to Tomo for safety and scramble along, trying
  not to look down. Just as I reach the top, the clouds part cinematically, the
  sky clears, the snowy mountain peaks gleam white against the blue and I catch
  my breath – literally and figuratively. Tomo tells me this ridge marks the
  border between Austria and Slovenia, and on the way back we pass one of the
  original border stones, engraved with “SR” for Slovenian Republic. I pause for
  a moment, with one foot in Austria and the other in Slovenia, thinking I need
  to brush up on my history. Supper back at the farm is cooked by Polona
  (available Tuesday to Saturday, book in advance) and served outside,
  weather-permitting, accompanied by a panoramic view of the mountains. I tuck
  into Slovenian beef noodle soup, “Easter bread” (simple and rustic) with
  home-made salami, and lamb and potatoes with salad from the greenhouses. The
  next day I cycle from the farm down to the village through an avenue of ash
  trees and across a flower meadow, known locally as “frog square”, to meet
  Tanja Rebolj, a self-taught čarovnica (herbalist), who makes a variety of
  teas, jams and herb-infused liquors that she sells from her home. She tells me
  there are more than 1,200 species of plant in the valley, one of the richest
  places to forage in Slovenia – and she sometimes runs workshops on herbs for
  visitors. Alongside its abundance of flowers and herbs, Jezersko is also one
  of the most densely forested valleys in the country, and Andreja Košir is my
  guide to the woods. A former UN translator, she now leads various forest
  experiences (family audio walk, €210). Hooked up with super-sensitive
  microphones and recording equipment, we stroll among the trees pausing to
  listen and record the “hidden sounds of nature”. An ants’ nest sounds just as
  frenetic as you might imagine. And when Andreja inserts specialist needle
  microphones into the earth, I hear water moving deep underground. “What
  fascinates me about nature,” she says, “is that trees can communicate so well.
  Beech trees are especially talkative – they exchange lots of information.” We
  have time, too, to simply relax in the woods. Swinging in a hammock, I glimpse
  the sky through the canopy, bird song rings out around me. A simple pleasure,
  but I leave with a profound feeling of wellbeing. Centuries ago, Jezersko was
  covered with a massive glacial lake, but an earthquake caused it to drain away
  in the 14th century. Today, the emerald green, heart-shaped, artificial Lake
  Planšar, proves irresistible as I cycle past. I gasp as I jump in – it’s
  bone-jarringly cold and I emerge flushed pink and energised, then ride home
  through sunlit meadows. On my last day, as the bells of St Andrej’s church
  ring out the hour, volunteers are busy in the farm’s Peter Rabbit gardens,
  chickens scratch at the grass and the sun slants through the apple trees. I
  take one last look up at Mount Baba before turning for home, feeling clearer
  and lighter. Mountains, forests and fairytale flowers, long hikes, cold swims
  and nurturing organic food … sometimes it’s the simple things that make for a
  magical holiday. The trip was supported by the Slovenian Tourist Board and
  Šenkova Domačija farm. Rooms from €119 B&amp;B; dinner €30 (book in advance);
  apartment for four from €165; camping from €12 Laura Coffey’s book, Enchanted
  Islands: Travels Through Myth and Magic, Love &amp; Loss, is now available in
  paperback (Summersdale, £10.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order
