  The danger posed to Donald Trump was obvious. It was a story that not only
  drew attention to his links to a convicted sex offender, it also risked
  widening a growing wedge between the president and some of his most vociferous
  supporters. The White House quickly concluded a full-force response was
  required. It was Tuesday 15 July. The Wall Street Journal had approached
  Trump’s team, stating it planned to publish allegations that Trump had
  composed a crude poem and doodle as part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey
  Epstein’s 50th birthday. The claim would have been damaging at any moment, but
  the timing was terrible for the president. The Epstein issue was developing
  into the biggest crisis of his presidency. Strident Maga supporters had been
  angered by the Trump administration’s refusal to release government files
  relating to the late sex offender. Trump and his loyal press secretary,
  Karoline Leavitt, reached for the nuclear option. From Air Force One, they
  called the Journal’s British editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker. They turned up the
  heat. Trump fumed that the letter was fake. Drawing wasn’t his thing. Threats
  were made to sue, a course of action he had previously unleashed against other
  perceived media enemies. Washington DC began to hum with rumours that the
  Journal had a hot story on its hands. When no article materialised on
  Wednesday, some insiders perceived a growing confidence within the White House
  that their rearguard action had killed the story. They were wrong. DC’s gossip
  mill had reached fever pitch by Thursday afternoon. The article finally
  emerged in the early evening. The city collectively stopped to read. In the
  hours that followed publication, the tension intensified. Trump revealed he
  had confronted Tucker, stating the story was “false, malicious, and
  defamatory”. By Friday, he had filed a lawsuit suing the Journal and its
  owners for at least $10bn (£7.6bn). Tucker was at the centre of a maelstrom of
  stress and political pressure. It was the greatest challenge of her two and a
  half years heading the Journal, but far from the first. Two months in, having
  been parachuted in from London, she was fronting a campaign to have the
  reporter Evan Gershkovich returned from a Russian prison. She had also faced
  denunciations from journalists as she pushed through a modernisation drive
  that included brutal layoffs. Her plans focused on giving stories a sharper
  edge. On that metric, the Trump call suggested she was overachieving.
  Throughout her rise, an enigmatic quality has surrounded Tucker. Friends,
  colleagues and even some critical employees describe an amiable, fun and
  disarmingly grounded person. Many regarded her ability to retain such
  qualities in the treacherous terrain of the Murdoch empire as uncanny. The
  puzzle is exacerbated by the assumption she does not share the rightwing,
  pro-Brexit views of Rupert Murdoch, News Corp’s legendary mogul. Yet Murdoch
  doesn’t hand the Journal to just anyone. While the pro-Maga Fox News is his
  empire’s cash cow, the Journal is his prized possession, giving him power and
  respectability in wider US political circles, as the Times does in the UK. So,
  why Tucker? The answer, according to people who have worked with her, is her
  possession of two qualities Murdoch rates highly: a willingness to make
  unpopular decisions for the sake of his businesses and a lust for a
  politically contentious scoop. Lionel Barber, a former Financial Times editor
  who also worked with Tucker for the FT in Brussels, said: “She has a very
  sharp nose for a good news story – always did.” Tucker edited the University
  of Oxford’s student magazine, the Isis, and joined the FT as a graduate
  trainee. “She was a very convivial colleague, great company and good on a
  night out, but you knew when it came down to the work, she would nail it,”
  said a colleague. “Very hard-nosed.” After stints in Brussels and Berlin, she
  won a powerful ally in Robert Thomson, then the FT’s foreign editor. Thomson
  became a close friend to Murdoch, a fellow Australian, while working in the US
  for the FT. Thomson jumped ship to edit the Times of London in 2002 and in
  2008 was dispatched to New York to oversee Murdoch’s freshly acquired Journal.
  Before he went, Thomson helped lure Tucker to the Times, where she eventually
  became deputy editor. It was her elevation to editor of the Sunday Times in
  2020 that seems to have impressed Murdoch. She showed a willingness to make
  difficult staffing decisions and widened the Sunday Times’s digital ambitions,
  recasting the pro-Brexit paper to appeal to a wider audience. It was there she
  made an enemy of her first populist world leader. Just months into her tenure,
  the Sunday Times published a damning account of how Boris Johnson, the then UK
  prime minister, had handled the Covid pandemic. Downing Street erupted, taking
  the unusual step of issuing a lengthy rebuttal, denouncing “falsehoods and
  errors”. The paper was called “the most hostile paper in the country” to
  Johnson’s government, despite having backed him at the previous year’s
  election. Rachel Johnson, the former prime minister’s sister, is one of
  Tucker’s closest friends. “I don’t think she was ever reckless,” said one
  Sunday Times staffer. “But I think she absolutely wanted to push the
  boundaries of getting as much into the public domain as she possibly could.”
  Many assumed Tucker’s destiny was to edit the Times, but she was catapulted to
  New York to run the Journal at the start of 2023, immediately embarking on a
  painful streamlining process. Senior editors were axed. Pulitzer prize winners
  ditched. The DC bureau, the most powerful, was particularly targeted with
  layoffs and new leadership. One reporter spoke of people crying, another of
  the process’s serious mental impact. It made Tucker’s editorship divisive,
  leading to the extraordinary spectacle of journalists plastering her
  unoccupied office with sticky notes denouncing the layoffs. Even some who
  accepted cuts questioned the methods. Several pointed to the use of
  “performance improvement plans”, with journalists claiming they had been
  handed unrealistic targets designed to push them out the door. One described
  it as “gratuitously cruel”. A Journal spokesperson said: “Performance
  improvement plans are used to set clear objectives and create a development
  plan that gives an employee feedback and support to meet those objectives.
  They are being used exactly as designed.” The Tucker enigma re-emerged at the
  Journal, as staff noted the same mix of personable demeanour, enthusiasm for
  stories and willingness to make cuts. “She’s very emotionally intelligent –
  like, the 99th percentile,” said one. They said morale had improved more
  recently. New hires have followed. A cultural shift on stories also arrived.
  What emerges is a Tucker Venn diagram. At its overlapping centre lie stories
  with two qualities: they cover legitimate areas of public importance and aim
  squarely at eye-catching topics with digital reach. Tucker gave investigative
  reporters the examples of Elon Musk and China as two potential areas. Some
  complained the topics were “clickbaity”. However, one journalist who had had
  reservations conceded: “Musk turned out to be a pretty good topic.” Tucker’s
  use of metrics around web traffic and time spent reading a story irked some
  reporters. Headlines were made more direct. Honorifics such as “Mr” and “Mrs”
  were ditched. There was a ban on stories having more than three bylines. “She
  loosened a lot of the strictures that we had,” said one staffer. “We’re
  encouraged to write more edgy stories.” Positioning the Journal as a punchy
  rival to the liberal New York Times juggernaut may be a good business plan,
  but doing so while not falling foul of Murdoch’s politics remains a delicate
  balance. “There’s a particular moment now where the Wall Street Journal has to
  prove its mettle as the pre-eminent business and financial markets media
  organisation,” said Paddy Harverson, a contemporary of Tucker’s at the FT, now
  a communications executive. “They’re up against Trump, yet they have an
  historically centre-right editorial view. She has guided the paper along that
  tightrope really well.” Allies said Tucker laid a marker of intent in terms of
  punchy stories when she published an article on the alleged cognitive decline
  of Joe Biden. It was initially described as a “hit piece” by the Biden
  administration. Some see the Epstein story as the latest evidence of Tucker’s
  shift. There are journalists, however, who blame Trump’s response for giving
  the story attention it simply didn’t warrant. Others disagree about the extent
  of Tucker’s changes, pointing to the Journal’s history of breaking contentious
  stories, including the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. However, the net
  result of the Epstein letter saga has been to draw attention to Tucker’s
  attempted change in tone. Trump’s lawsuit means the furore may only just be
  beginning. Many seasoned media figures assume Murdoch, who does not respond
  well to bullying, will not back down. However, neither billionaire will relish
  having to face depositions and disclosures. Any settlement from Murdoch could
  put pressure on Tucker, depending on its details. Dow Jones, which publishes
  the Journal, has said it has “full confidence in the rigour and accuracy of
  our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit”. The courts may
  yet reject Trump’s case. “I don’t think [Murdoch] will just flop over,” said
  Barber. “The issue here is that Trump went around boasting that he killed the
  story … For an editor, that’s very difficult. But I’m pretty damn confident
  there’s no way [Tucker] would publish without having it properly sourced.”
