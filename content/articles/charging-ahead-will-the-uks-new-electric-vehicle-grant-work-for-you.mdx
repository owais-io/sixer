  Is it time to go electric? The UK car industry certainly thinks so and is
  readying for a surge in demand as a new subsidy scheme cuts the price of some
  electric cars by up to £3,750. With purchase prices – not to mention range
  anxiety – contributing to weak consumer uptake, the government grants are
  designed to bring the upfront cost closer to a petrol car. Making them cheaper
  will also give “thousands more drivers access to savings of up to £1,500 a
  year in fuel and running costs compared to a petrol car”, officials say.
  Robert Forrester, the chief executive of the car dealership group Vertu
  Motors, says: “With the average new electric vehicle now costing close to
  £49,000, the market has drifted away from the everyday motorist. “This grant
  helps correct that, opening access to a wider range of customers by making
  sub-£40,000 EVs more appealing and financially viable.” The scheme The £650m
  electric car grant (ECG) is a reboot of a previous state-backed money-off
  scheme to incentivise drivers to switch, before a ban on the sale of new fully
  petrol or diesel cars and vans from 2030. There are two tiers pegged to how
  green the manufacturing process is. The greenest vehicles in “band one”
  qualify for a £3,750 discount while for “band two” vehicles the figure is
  £1,500. All eligible vehicles must have an RRP below £37,000. The grant only
  applies to new cars. The good news is that consumers don’t have to fill in any
  extra paperwork when they make a purchase. It is the manufacturer that applies
  for the grant, with the allocated funds deducted from the car’s list price.
  Tom Jervis, the consumer editor at Auto Express, says that while the grant is
  aimed at EVs costing under £37,000 “price alone isn’t enough”. “Eligibility
  also depends on manufacturer commitment to emissions targets, the
  environmental impact of the battery and production process, and where the car
  and battery are built,” he says. “It is based on lifecycle carbon costs,
  meaning the country of assembly and battery production play a major role.” The
  price and environmental conditions attached to securing a grant mean that some
  well-known brands, including Tesla, are not part of the scheme. To qualify the
  manufacturer must have a science-based target for cutting greenhouse gas
  emissions. These are verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, an
  independent body that assesses corporate sustainability plans. Vehicles made
  in countries where the electricity grid is more reliant on fossil fuels will
  get a higher score than those made in one powered by renewables or nuclear.
  This focus on emissions essentially excludes vehicles made in China with its
  reliance on coal-fired power stations. Which cars are eligible? Although the
  scheme was launched formally in the middle of July, the full list of
  qualifying cars is still some way off. That’s because manufacturers need to
  apply to be considered for funding. This week, the government announced the
  first. On the list are 19 models from four carmakers: Citroën, Renault, Nissan
  and Vauxhall. They include the Citroën ë-C3 – Auto Express’s 2024 car of the
  year – Renault Megane, Nissan Micra and Vauxhall Grandland Electric. They are
  now available at the band two discount of £1,500 each. The Department for
  Transport (DfT) has a dedicated page on the gov.uk website which it is
  updating on a rolling basis with the list of approved vehicles. It says it
  expects to approve more models over the coming weeks. The £37,000 cut-off
  point narrows the choice significantly in a market where about 70% of new EVs
  cost over £40,000. It rules out upmarket models, including the UK’s
  bestselling EV, the Tesla Model Y, and every other Tesla on sale. No Audi, BMW
  or Mercedes EV would now be eligible either. The scheme’s design also favours
  European over Chinese-built cars. “Countries with high-carbon electricity,
  like China, are penalised in the grant calculations, meaning Chinese-built EVs
  like the MG4, BYD Dolphin, and Leapmotor models are expected to only qualify
  for the £1,500 tier – if they qualify at all,” says Jervis. “South Korean
  brands like Hyundai and Kia are in a grey area – reliant on fossil-fuel-heavy
  grids but potentially meeting other sustainability metrics. Their eligibility
  will likely vary by model.” He adds: “The scheme is unapologetically tilted in
  favour of European production with cleaner assembly and battery footprints,
  and this has given many manufacturers confidence that they will qualify.” The
  latest Nissan Leaf, which is being produced at the Japanese manufacturer’s
  Sunderland plant, is thought to be a shoo-in for scheme qualification when it
  arrives in showrooms later this year. Auto Express has compiled a list of the
  52 cars its writers think could qualify if they meet the sustainability
  criteria. A recent poll by online marketplace Carwow found that four in 10
  drivers thought the scheme excluded too many of the EVs now on sale. The
  objective is to make budget EVs more attractive to the public as opposed to
  executives who lease them, or acquire them as company cars, or through salary
  sacrifice schemes. Carwow’s Iain Reid says: “Crucially, the grant applies to
  both outright purchases and leasing deals, making electric vehicles more
  accessible to a wider range of private drivers.” Discounts by carmakers If you
  have your heart set on a car marque unlikely to make the cut the good news is
  that the scheme has triggered a wave of price cuts by manufacturers who don’t
  want to be left behind. The Chinese brand Leapmotor has, for example, launched
  what it calls a leap-grant, with adverts that pose the question: “Why wait for
  the government?” It has cut the price of its cheapest model, the To3, by
  £1,500 to £14,495 and is billing it as the “UK’s most affordable 5-door
  electric city car”. It has also cut the price of its C10 SUV by £3,750,
  bringing it down to £32,750. Other manufacturers have taken action to make
  sure models come under the price threshold for the scheme. Jervis says: “Both
  the Vauxhall Grandland and Renault Scenic were slightly above the cut-off when
  the grant was first announced, but the entry point for the Scenic range has
  dropped by £200 and the Grandland by £400 to put both electric SUVs at
  £36,995. “Getting the entry models under £37,000 is crucial for brands, as
  that brings the entire lineup using the same battery into eligibility.” He
  says Chinese carmakers GWM Ora and MG have also cut prices by up to £3,750,
  “likely because they fear they won’t qualify – in order to stay competitive.
  Volvo, Hyundai and Kia all launched offers too, and we are likely to see more
  brands follow suit over the next few weeks.” Buy now or wait? With the scheme
  scheduled to run until 2027–28 – or until the funding is exhausted – early
  signs point to strong demand. Carwow’s Reid says: “Traffic to our EV grant
  information pages surged 160% immediately after the announcement. The
  government’s previous plug-in car grant, which ended in June 2022, helped
  increase electric car sales by 70% within a year. Our advice is to start
  researching and test-driving now. On average, the car-buying journey takes
  around 190 days, so being prepared means you can act fast once the grant
  applies to your chosen model. There’s a definite first-mover advantage and
  today’s mix of official and brand incentives may not stick around for long.”
  Now is a “very good time to go and buy an electric vehicle”, says Vertu
  Motors’ Forrester. “It’s coming at a time when we are, for the first time,
  seeing cheaper electric vehicles on the market.” He adds: “I think there’ll be
  a limited number [of cars approved for grants] because a lot of manufacturers
  don’t think they will comply and are discounting to overcome the competitive
  disadvantage. Whether you get a grant or not, doesn’t really matter, does it?
  The price has come down.”
