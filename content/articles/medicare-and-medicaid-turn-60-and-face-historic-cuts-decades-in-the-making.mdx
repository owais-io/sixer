  The US’s largest public health insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid, turn
  60 years old on Wednesday – a birthday that will be celebrated only weeks
  after Republicans enacted the largest cuts to healthcare in the nation’s
  history. Passed in the civil rights era, the sister health insurance programs
  served as tools for the Democratic president Lyndon Johnson to desegregate
  American healthcare and fight poverty. “This is an infamous day for the US,
  which already has the most abysmal healthcare system among our peer nations,”
  said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown Law.
  “Now, in order to give tax relief and spend more on defense, we’re kicking off
  our most needy citizens from life-saving care.” In a health system defined by
  a patchwork of public and private coverage, Medicare and Medicaid have stood
  for 60 years as the civil rights era’s health legacy – their history more
  often marked by expansion than contraction, even amid decades of attacks from
  conservatives. That history took a sharp right turn on the Fourth of July,
  when Donald Trump signed a Republican budget law that will cut $1tn from
  Medicaid beginning in 2026. “It’s really unconscionable these cuts,” said
  David Lipschutz, co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, speaking
  about both programs. “The magnitude, the scope, the targeting of certain
  lawfully present immigrants, the added requirements and burdens for people
  with Medicaid – specifically designed to purge the roles of people who would
  otherwise be eligible.” Today, Medicare insures more than 68 million seniors,
  and Medicaid insures 71 million low-income, elderly and disabled adults. Cuts
  signed by Trump are expected to result in nearly 12 million people losing
  Medicaid coverage and another 5 million people losing health insurance because
  of a reduction in government subsidies to private insurance, through so-called
  “Obamacare” plans. The cuts are the largest in the program’s history, and
  enact decades of conservative rhetoric – tracing all the way back to
  then-actor Ronald Reagan’s 1961 criticism of public health insurance as
  “socialized medicine”. What’s the history of Medicare and Medicaid? Medicare
  and Medicaid were enacted together on 30 July 1965 – born with Johnson’s
  signature on the Social Security Amendments of 1965, or HR 6675. The programs
  represented both an enormous victory and, in a way, a concession. A group of
  campaigners for universal health coverage tried and failed to pass a “national
  health insurance” after the second world war – in large part because of the
  antagonism of American doctors – around the same time that the United
  Kingdom’s National Health Service was getting off the ground. Unable to
  achieve universal coverage, proponents settled for an “add-on” to social
  security, the retirement benefit for older Americans, according to Pulitzer
  prize-winning author Paul Starr, whose book, The Social Transformation of
  American Medicine, is the authoritative history. “Medicaid was a footnote,”
  said Starr. “The whole focus was on passing Medicare.” Medicare also sought to
  correct a searing injustice in American healthcare – Jim Crow segregation that
  extended to America’s doctor’s office and hospitals. In 1946, congressional
  lawmakers modernized the nation’s healthcare facilities with the Hill-Burton
  Act, but did so with a “separate but equal” philosophy. For nearly two
  decades, Hill-Burton helped construct or modernize 6,800 facilities in 4,000
  communities, often excluding Black patients and physicians. “Typical practice
  in the south would be to see all the white patients first, and see the Black
  patients last,” said Starr. “Hospitals were segregated and Black people did
  not have access to mainstream hospital care in many places.” A 1963 supreme
  court case against a North Carolina hospital found that the “separate but
  equal” doctrine was unconstitutional. In a few short years, hospitals and
  clinics across the country desegregated to participate in Medicare. Less
  recognized at the time was the power of Medicaid, and how its structure –
  jointly operated by the states and federal government – would make it more
  vulnerable to political attacks. “Medicaid gradually grew to being the system
  of health insurance for low-income people, for people with disabilities. It
  became the method of financing nursing homes in the US,” said Starr. Medicare
  and Medicaid led, “not only to desegregating, but elevating life expectancy
  across the states and reducing disparities among racial and ethnic minorities,
  women, children and older adults and people with disabilities,” said Daniel
  Dawes, an expert on global health policy at Meharry Medical College. When did
  conservatives start pushing for cuts? Beginning in the Reagan era in the
  1980s, conservatives proposed transforming Medicaid from an “entitlement”,
  which does not cap costs, to a limited “block grant” to states – necessarily
  capping how many people and what services would be covered. The former House
  speaker Newt Gingrich, George W Bush’s administration and the former House
  speaker Paul Ryan, all Republicans, made proposals to block-grant Medicaid.
  Decades of rhetoric pushing to cut Medicaid carried into talking points about
  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature spending bill. Trump
  officials rolled out vintage Republican arguments to describe Medicaid
  beneficiaries as caught in “a lifelong trap of dependency”. A wide array of
  evidence shows most Medicaid beneficiaries who can work already do, and new
  requirements instead function as red tape to limit enrollment. Polls show that
  Medicaid is widely popular, even among Republicans. The Obama administration
  led a historic expansion of Medicaid in 2010, through the Affordable Care Act
  (ACA), better known as Obamacare. For the first time, Medicaid would cover
  working-age single adults – not just pregnant women or families, as the
  program had traditionally done. In 2025, a major economic study again showed
  its benefits: expanding Medicaid to millions more Americans probably saved
  more than 27,000 lives. The improvement in Americans’ health was perhaps only
  matched by the ferocity of attacks from the political right. For nearly a
  decade, the repeal of Obamacare became a cornerstone of Republican politics.
  Trump himself has only sporadically engaged in the healthcare debate. In 2017,
  he would tell the press: “Nobody knew that healthcare could be so
  complicated.” Before he was elected again in 2024, he said he had “concepts of
  a plan” to replace Obamacare, and promised not to touch Medicaid, Medicare or
  social security. Trump first attempted to repeal Obamacare in 2017, a change
  that would have left an estimated 15 million people without insurance. The
  bill was memorably tanked with a thumbs-down from the Republican senator John
  McCain. However, ideas about how to cut Medicaid did not sink with the bill.
  In 2018, the Trump administration approved the first Medicaid work
  requirements as pilots in Arkansas and Georgia. Courts struck down those
  pilots, but they now form a critical part of how the One Big Beautiful Bill
  Act is expected to push people off the program. Starr described the cuts to
  Medicaid as out of step with reality. “A lot of people do work at the minimum
  wage, millions of people, and they’re still poor,” he said. “And by the way
  those minimum-wage jobs won’t provide them any healthcare – so you’re just
  going to let them die when they get sick? What are you going to do?” What will
  be the effects of the recent cuts? The enormous cuts to Medicaid have set off
  new wrangling within the Republican party, including efforts by the Missouri
  Republican senator Josh Hawley to repeal the cuts for which he just voted.
  Republicans could face further backlash when cuts to Medicaid start to hit
  rural hospitals around 2026. A June analysis by the University of North
  Carolina’s Sheps Center for Health Services Research found that 338 rural
  hospitals, including dozens in states such as Louisiana, Kentucky and
  Oklahoma, could close as a result of the spending bill. There are nearly 1,800
  rural hospitals nationally, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a
  healthcare research non-profit. “While we’ve tried to chip away at Medicaid
  for many, many decades this is the first time Congress has really gutted the
  program,” said Gostin. “People will die, a lot of people will die. A lot of
  people will get very, very sick, have preventable illnesses, and so to me this
  is just simply historic and unconscionable.”
