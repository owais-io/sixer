  A quarter of Australia’s professional netballers took the court in last
  Saturday’s Super Netball grand final, because in the world’s best netball
  league there is minimal space at the top. With eight teams each having 10
  contracted players, it’s a hard-fought battle for promising athletes to claim
  a part-time training position let alone a coveted full-time spot. Netball has
  benefited from being the premier women’s sport in Australia for some time. It
  was one of the first to have a national league in the 1980s, and has long
  since held the mantle of the most played sport for women and girls. The
  Diamonds are one of the most accomplished and trophy-laden teams this country
  has ever produced. But with the rise of elite women’s leagues in other sports,
  athletes are looking elsewhere for opportunities rather than spending years
  waiting on the Super Netball sidelines. Former Melbourne Mavericks player
  Olivia Lewis recently recalled an interaction with a 13-year-old who felt she
  was already at this crossroads. Despite enjoying netball more, the young girl
  had decided to focus on Australian rules, enticed by the larger list sizes of
  the AFLW. Then, last week, Lewis herself announced she was leaving netball to
  pursue AFLW. “I definitely reflected on the question that if AFLW was around
  when I was 14, 15, would I have still pursued netball?” she says. “Obviously
  [I’m] very grateful with how everything in my life has turned out, but I do
  think it’s great that young athletes have so many options now as far as the
  ability to play women’s sport.” Earning the title of being the “world’s
  premier elite netball competition”, as the Super Netball is marketed, means
  attracting global talent. International stars like Jamaica’s Jhaniele
  Fowler-Nembhard and England’s Helen Housby ply their trade here. However, with
  only about 65 contracted positions available after excluding international
  players, the domestic battle for spots is fierce. And without the luxury of
  the extended squads that other sports have, injury rather than performance is
  the primary reason for changes to the matchday squad in Super Netball. There
  have been some attempts to improve the situation. In 2024, the optional “11th
  player” was introduced, a six-month minimum-salary position designed to
  bolster pathway progression for junior Australian players. Its role was
  expanded in 2025 to allow that player to be promoted to the matchday squad
  without requiring a contracted player to be injured. The 11th player position
  may be a step in the right direction, but even for full-time players the
  financial situation remains tricky. The minimum pay for an athlete in the
  contracted 10 will rise to $46,600 by the end of the current collective
  bargaining agreement, and to $23,300 for the 11th players. Clubs can also have
  three additional “training partners”, with the minimum pay in 2025 just
  $5,665. The lowest tier AFLW contracts are worth $67,337 in 2025. So,
  teenagers who excel at multiple sports face a dilema: attempt to enter a
  system that can guarantee positions, financially agreeable contracts and
  development, or hold out for the elusive Super Netball contract that may be
  several years down the track? Poppy Scholz, a first-year AFLW player this
  season with Carlton and daughter of Australian Diamonds legend Peta Scholz,
  says netball requires a huge commitment required with no financial security,
  which makes it especially difficult for players who need to relocate to pursue
  their dream. “If you want to be a training partner in Melbourne, you have to
  work and play netball seven times a week in the preseason,” she says. “It’s
  not enough money to live on. Whereas in football, they’re so well supported by
  the AFL, so I can move to Melbourne, live out of home and be financially set
  up.” The AFLW draft provides a favourable model, Scholz says, whereby in a
  singular day all emerging talent know whether or not they will be picked up in
  the football system for the year ahead. This was experienced firsthand by
  Georgie Cleaver, a second-year West Coast Eagles player and former training
  partner of the West Coast Fever. “With footy, when you turn 18, if you’re in
  the best 50 footballers in Australia, you’re going to get drafted,” Cleaver
  says. “Whereas in netball, at 18, 19, 20, you’re not guaranteed a spot at
  all.” It is hard to break into the system after years on the periphery, but
  it’s not impossible. Sharni Lambden had spent eight years as a training
  partner across the now defunct Collingwood Magpies and the Melbourne Vixens
  with just a single Super Netball appearance in 2022, when in 2024, due to an
  injury to Vixens player Kate Eddy, she got the break she had been waiting for.
  By the end of that year, she had signed the long-sought-after contract with
  the NSW Swifts. The reality is that many capable players can’t wait that long.
  They have had languishing careers waiting in the wings, or have been forced to
  give up their sport to pursue financial stability. With trade season now
  officially open, the dreams for many on the precipice of Super Netball
  greatness hang in the balance.
