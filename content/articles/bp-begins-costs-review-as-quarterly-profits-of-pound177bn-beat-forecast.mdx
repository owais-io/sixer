  The oil and gas group BP is launching a fresh cost-cutting scheme, despite
  reporting better-than-expected profits, as it tries to do more for its
  shareholders to fend off pressure from activist investors. The fossil fuel
  company said it would begin a fresh review of its business when its new chair,
  Albert Manifold, joins the board in September. BP reported a rise in profits
  to $2.35bn (£1.77bn) between April and June, a drop of 15% on the same period
  a year earlier when the company benefited from higher oil and gas prices.
  However, it was an increase on the $1.38bn reported in the January to March
  quarter, and beat analysts’ estimates of $1.8bn underlying profits. Murray
  Auchincloss, BP’s chief executive, said in a statement on Tuesday that the
  FTSE 100 company had performed well “operationally and strategically”, even
  though crude oil is trading at about 10% lower than it was in the first
  quarter. Currently trading at just under $66 a barrel, Brent crude prices are
  lower than last year’s average of $80 a barrel. Auchincloss added: “So far
  this year we’ve brought five new oil and gas major projects onstream,
  sanctioned four more and made 10 exploration discoveries.” Disclosing a 4%
  increase in the shareholder dividend to 8.32 cents in the first quarter, he
  said: “BP can and will do better for its investors.” The CEO said he and
  Manifold, the former boss of the building material company CRH who takes the
  reins on 1 October, had agreed to conduct a review of its businesses; this
  year BP revealed it would cut more than $5bn from its green investment plan.
  Under the embattled current chair, Helge Lund, BP invested heavily in the
  offshore wind industry, which has been subject to increasing costs in recent
  years, at the same time as its rivals took advantage of the surge in fossil
  fuel prices after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. BP’s latest
  overhaul was just six months ago, when Auchincloss promised to “fundamentally
  reset” the oil company’s strategy. This revamp met little investor enthusiasm
  and failed to increase its share price. BP’s shares are trading about 10%
  lower than at the time of Auchincloss’s announcement. The company is also
  under pressure from Elliott Management, the feared New York hedge fund known
  for its attempts to shake up listed companies, which has built up a stake in
  BP after growing dissatisfaction among shareholders over the company’s plans
  to curb its fossil fuel production in favour of green investments. The
  activist investor has been pushing BP to cut its operating expenses more
  aggressively and has been demanding more cost reductions. Lund’s forthcoming
  departure helps BP to sever ties with its botched attempt to reinvent itself
  as a net zero energy company, forged during Lund’s tenure and that of its
  former chief executive Bernard Looney. Russ Mould, an investment director at
  broker AJ Bell, said: “At present BP still has a modestly larger workforce
  than Shell – based on the companies’ respective last reported headcounts –
  despite being a significantly smaller business in terms of its valuation and
  annual revenue.” BP said this week it had made its largest oil and gas
  discovery of the past 25 years off the coast of Brazil at a time when it is
  shifting away from renewables and refocusing on fossil fuels. The company is
  carrying out tests at the Santos basin, which is located in deep waters. It
  marks its 10th oil discovery of the year and could be its largest since its
  discovery at the Shah Deniz gasfield in Azerbaijan in 1999.
