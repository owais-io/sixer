  Wembley was supposed to be a case of the men who weren’t there. It ended up
  posing questions of the team asked to defend the Premier League title.
  Alexander Isak may become a Liverpool player. That will be decided soon enough
  by the transfer market; a game of charades is being played before money
  eventually dictates its conclusion. Modern football’s eternal melodramas fade
  into insignificance when considering the player Isak could replace as a
  Liverpool centre‑forward. The club plays under the shadow of the loss of Diogo
  Jota, his death alongside his brother André Silva on a Spanish highway– its
  shattering of family and friends – a reminder that football is played by real
  people with real lives. Liverpool’s pre‑match lineup did not feature a No 20,
  Jota’s number retired. The season ahead will be played in memory of a popular,
  skilled yet understated professional – 12 months ago at Ipswich he was the
  scorer of the first Premier League goal of Arne Slot’s reign. Jota died a
  champion, a beloved teammate. Before kick-off, Wembley was supposed to observe
  a minute’s silence, only for an idiot fringe of Crystal Palace’s fans to shame
  themselves by chanting – a tiny number, though enough for a booed response
  from Liverpool fans with the referee, Chris Kavanagh, blowing his whistle
  quickly. What should have been a moment of perspective was sullied. Football’s
  ability to crack on blithely in the face of tragedy is one of its worst
  qualities. The Palace contingent, 99% of whom had been observant, wanted to
  get their own message across. “Uefa mafia” declared a banner, highlighted by
  burning pyro. Palace’s summer of FA Cup celebration is still overshadowed by
  the legal wrangle over their European participation – the outcome of the
  club’s appeal due to be announced on Monday – while Uefa and the Nottingham
  Forest principal Evangelos Marinakis had their names taken in vain in a
  lengthy chorus of disdain. The show rolled inexorably on, Wembley offering a
  snapshot of a new Liverpool. Whether Jota would have been part of the sporting
  director Richard Hughes’s plans to overhaul the squad Jürgen Klopp left last
  year for Slot is for the birds but it was Hugo Ekitiké, part of the overhaul,
  who scored first. As a central striker, Ekitiké looked much like the real deal
  should Isak not arrive. A player denied a chance to shine at Paris
  Saint-Germain – who turned to galacticos – put his mark down, though rued a
  couple of misses. Florian Wirtz added grace and magic, all drops of the
  shoulder and acceleration, sometimes strolling, sometimes darting, carrying
  the haughty, aristocratic air of the very best German footballers. Liverpool
  became champions last season by their consistency, patiently taking the steam
  from opponents. Pre-season and Wembley suggest a more open‑house approach,
  with attendant vulnerabilities. Amid the sound and fury of an occasion played
  at near full pelt by both teams, the problems of Liverpool turning the dial up
  to 11 on attack were soon apparent. Jeremie Frimpong is not Trent
  Alexander‑Arnold as an attacking full-back, breaking behind the lines rather
  than passing beyond them. His goal was almost certainly inadvertent, but
  showed the dimensions he might add. That he scored on 20min 20sec, as
  Liverpool fans remembered Jota, showed perfect timing, too. That Eberechi Eze,
  drifting inside left, had Frimpong’s defensive measure was just one problem.
  Liverpool’s other Dutch defender, Virgil van Dijk, was unusually clumsy in
  bringing down Ismaïla Sarr for a penalty, flat-footed on other occasions. The
  return of another Dutchman, Ryan Gravenberch, who was on paternity leave, or
  Alexis Mac Allister, short of fitness to start, may solve such issues but
  there was top-heaviness and imbalance. Opposing scouts will have noticed the
  lack of cover Mohamed Salah provided to Frimpong, as was often the case for
  Alexander-Arnold. The Egyptian king’s creative partnership with Wirtz needs
  working on, too. There was a fault on the line between them, Salah reduced to
  one effort on goal – sometimes enough but not here, and dragged into Dean
  Henderson’s hands. The less said about his shootout penalty the better. If
  Milos Kerkez was ever keen to overlap, Sarr’s running showed he can be exposed
  defensively, and the out-of-position Hungarian was at fault as his tormentor
  scored Palace’s second equaliser. Perhaps a £150m forward is not the answer
  Slot is looking for. Marc Guéhi, a central defender Liverpool are linked with
  but may be beyond their spending limits should Isak actually arrive, showed
  typical cool as Palace assumed control in the second half. Adam Wharton, a
  midfielder the elite should covet, found his forwards with his passing range.
  Oliver Glasner has barely been able to add to his squad during the summer’s
  limbo but the Austrian’s golden touch continued as Palace edged a nerve-filled
  shootout to celebrate another trophy win. For Liverpool, losing the Community
  Shield cannot come remotely close to the genuine, human loss of the friend and
  teammate without whom their squad must play on. Wembley suggested reclaiming
  the glory enjoyed when Jota was among them may not be as easy as a summer of
  transfer fantasy had made it seem.
