  Emergency care at the hospital where Lucy Letby worked is falling far short of
  legal standards, the healthcare watchdog has found, with routine corridor care
  and “critical gaps” in sepsis treatment. The Countess of Chester hospital, in
  north-west England, was issued with an urgent warning notice after inspectors
  found “repeated breaches” of regulations in its emergency care unit. The Care
  Quality Commission (CQC) rated the A&amp;E as “inadequate” and the overall
  service as “requires improvement”. Letby, who worked on the Countess’s
  neonatal unit, is serving 15 whole-life prison terms after being convicted of
  murdering seven babies and attempting to kill another seven between June 2015
  and June 2016. The 35-year-old former nurse has asked the Criminal Cases
  Review Commission to review her convictions in the hope of overturning them at
  the court of appeal. Inspectors found “visibly dirty equipment”, poor
  infection control, overcrowding, prolonged handover times and corridor care
  that “compromised dignity and safety”. The 42-page report, due to be published
  in the coming days, said there were “critical gaps” in the hospital’s sepsis
  treatment and mental health risk assessments. The latest data from June 2024
  suggested it was only treating 59% of sepsis patients within an hour, far
  short of the 84% target. Karen Knapton, a CQC deputy director, said the
  Countess had failed to address previous concerns about its emergency services
  “which continued to place people at risk”. She said: “People were sometimes
  held in ambulances for prolonged periods of time due to this limited capacity
  in the department. We also saw someone with suspected sepsis not receiving
  treatment according to national guidance placing them at risk of harm.
  “Staffing gaps combined with a very busy department meant people being cared
  for in corridor beds had become normalised. People with complex needs, such as
  those with learning disabilities or mental health conditions, often
  experienced even longer wait times resulting in an overall poorer experience.”
  Jane Tomkinson, the chief executive for Countess of Chester hospital NHS
  foundation trust, said she was “disappointed” by the CQC rating and that it
  had taken immediate action. “Whilst we have seen improvements, it is clear the
  actions taken in the last 12 months need to be enhanced to consistently
  deliver the experience and care our patients deserve. “Our focus remains on
  addressing some longstanding challenges and we are committed to supporting our
  teams to ensure that the actions we take lead to sustainable improvements in
  our services.”
