  Sunderland are preparing a formal objection over council plans to build
  housing within 23 metres of the Stadium of Light. The club fear the scheme
  would leave the stadium landlocked, preventing any future capacity increase.
  Sunderland city council is expected to submit plans this week for 600
  apartments and townhouses to be built behind the South Stand of the
  49,000-seat stadium, on a former industrial estate. The club recently
  submitted a pre-planning application for a redevelopment of the South Stand
  and believe the project would erase an agreed buffer zone. The stadium is
  vital to the local economy, hosts regular music concerts and has staged
  England senior football internationals. The former club chair Sir Bob Murray,
  who oversaw the stadium’s construction, said: “This is not just poor planning,
  it’s a disgrace. You don’t strangle your greatest asset and call it progress.”
  The council says there would still be room for stadium expansion. Murray
  recognises the need for new housing in the area but believes the current plans
  are sited too close to the stadium. “I helped shape protections,” said Murray
  of the buffer zone. “The council agreed them and now they’ve torn them up. I’m
  aware the club will formally object and I fully support their position. The
  council’s plans are shameful, shortsighted and completely unacceptable.
  “There’s been no real consultation, no transparency and no accountability. The
  council is trying to rewrite its own rules behind closed doors – and in doing
  so it risks sabotaging a major driver of jobs, pride and regeneration for
  ever.” Murray is demanding the council withdraw the applications. “This isn’t
  just about football, it’s about Sunderland’s identity, investment and
  ambition,” he said. “If this plan goes ahead the city will regret it for
  decades.” Patrick Melia, the council’s chief executive, said: “We have held
  extensive discussions with Sir Bob Murray in relation to this development and
  have acknowledged his comments. “Robust assurances have been given that the
  proposed Sheepfolds development will not impact on any planned future
  expansion of the Stadium of Light or its ability to host matches, concerts or
  other events. The council has sought specialist expertise in developing the
  proposals that are currently out for consultation.”
