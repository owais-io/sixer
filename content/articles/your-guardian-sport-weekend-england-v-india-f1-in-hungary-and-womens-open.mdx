  Saturday 11am Australia v British &amp; Irish Lions live Rugby union The Lions
  have history on their minds as they head into the third and final Test against
  the Wallabies determined to sweep a series for the first time in living
  memory, with Lee Calvert keeping the updates flowing. No Lions team has even
  gone unbeaten since Willie John McBride’s Invincibles in South Africa in 1974,
  when a controversial draw in the fourth match denied them the sweep. The Lions
  did sweep Argentina 4-0 in 1927 and also beat the Wallabies 2-0 three times in
  the 1950s and 1960s as part of losing tours of New Zealand, but you would need
  to go back to 1904 for the last 3-0 triumph on a trip solely to Australia. For
  Australia, Saturday is all about salvaging some pride after losing the second
  Test, and the series, to a last-minute try in Melbourne last week. The
  Wallabies have proved they can play by “winning” the second half of the
  opening Test 14-10 in Brisbane and taking a 23-5 lead after half an hour of
  the second in Melbourne. Reporting from Sydney are Robert Kitson, Gerard
  Meagher and Angus Fontaine. 11am England v India, fifth Test live Cricket
  After two weather-affected days of play at the Oval, day three gets underway,
  with Tanya Aldred and Rob Smyth your over-by-over hosts. India have faced
  England in 14 matches at the Oval, and seven have ended in a draw. India only
  have two wins, and those came 50 years apart. In 1971, and more recently in
  2021’s fourth Test. The tourists were then indebted to Shardul Thakur’s twin
  half-centuries that rescued a 100-run first-innings deficit. Our reporting
  team at the Oval is Ali Martin, Barney Ronay and Simon Burnton. 12.45pm Tour
  de France Femmes live Cycling The eighth chapter of this year’s race takes
  place in the mountains – the queen stage of the 2025 edition. Straight into
  the Bauges massif, on the way out of Chambéry comes the formidable Col de
  Plainpalais (13.2km at 6.3%). After the Col du Frêne, the race arrives at the
  Maurienne, where its toughest flank promises a rigorous test for the riders.
  Extending to 18.6km, with regular changes in gradient (averaging 8.1%) and a
  rough surface, it’s a climb certain to spur breakaways. Amy Sedghi keeps the
  live updates flowing. 1.45pm Football clockwatch Football Barry Glendenning
  has all the news, action and transfer updates as the EFL season begins with a
  full programme of League One and Two fixtures. Games to watch out for include
  Cardiff’s first outing at Peterborough in the lunchtime kick-off. The Welsh
  club were relegated last season but a fresh start under new manager Brian
  Barry-Murphy offers hope. Huddersfield have also changed manager, bringing in
  Lee Grant for what is the former Stoke goalkeeper’s first managerial role.
  They meet Leyton Orient, who made it to Wembley but fell just short in the
  playoff final. In League Two, Simon Mail is at MK Dons v Oldham. 3pm England v
  Spain Women’s rugby union England begin their home World Cup on Friday 22
  August against the United States in Sunderland but first up are two warm-ups:
  Spain at Leicester, followed by France next weekend. Flanker Abi Burton is
  expected to make her first Test start for England. The 25-year-old
  Trailfinders player scored two tries as a replacement on her international
  debut against Wales during the Six Nations before again coming off the bench
  in the successful Grand Slam decider against France. She will line up at
  blindside flanker in a back row that contains Marlie Packer as captain and
  Maddie Feaunati at eight. Luke McLaughlin reports from the King Power. 3pm
  Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying live Formula One Lando Norris finished second
  to McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri at Spa, the Australian once more edging
  clear as the title frontrunner with a 16-point lead. Mercedes, meanwhile, will
  be seeking to step up before the summer break in a fluctuating season for
  George Russell. The British driver claimed four podiums in the first six
  races, and one in the next seven, albeit his victory in Canada. Worryingly, a
  batch of hot upgrades to his car have made little improvement to his fortunes.
  “It seems quite strange how we’ve gone so far backwards,” he quails. Tom
  Bassam follows the action live online, with Giles Richards at the Hungaroring.
  6pm Glorious Goodwood Racing The Sussex meeting has certainly offered some
  surprises and the keenest of racing followers will no doubt be drawn to
  Saturday’s Coral Stewards’ Cup. Contenders include Group-class sprinter in the
  making Hammer The Hammer. Kevin Ryan’s three-year-old only ran twice last year
  and his improvement this season has been startling. Runner-up first time back
  at Southwell, he then won there in March off a mark of 80 and won again off 82
  before bolting up at Chester’s May meeting off 88 when he was put away for
  Ascot. Greg Wood is up on the Trundle with reports and tipping expertise.
  7.30pm UK Championships Athletics The Alexander Stadium sees the UK’s leading
  athletes contest for national titles and spots on the Great Britain team for
  this year’s World Championships, which take place in India in October. Day one
  has plenty to offer, and culminates in the men and women’s 100m finals. Ben
  Bloom reports from Birmingham. Sunday 11am England v India live Cricket India
  trail 2-1 in the series after the first four Tests, their batters digging them
  out of a huge Old Trafford hole in the last Test, despite being nought for two
  in the first over and trailing by more than 300 runs. If anything this
  compelling, dramatic and often petulant series has shown time and again that
  it’s direction can take an acute turn at any moment. Taha Hashim and James
  Wallace bring you all the action over by over from day four of the fifth Test
  at the Oval. 1pm Women’s Open live Golf Scott Murray keeps a watchful and
  expert eye on final-round developments at Royal Porthcawl. Japanese players
  Rio Takeda and Eri Okayama dominated the early rounds, with Chisato Iwai, Mao
  Saigo and Shiho Kuwaki offering a challenge. But there is certainly more to
  come from the 21-year-old sensation Lottie Woad as well as fellow English
  golfer Mimi Rhodes. The latter, a 23-year-old from Bath, played in the 2024
  Curtis Cup before turning professional and has enjoyed a spectacular year on
  the Ladies European Tour with three victories. World No 1 Nelly Korda and home
  favourite Darcey Harry, from nearby Penarth and a Royal Porthcawl member, will
  keep the pressure on. Ewan Murray reports. 2pm Tour de France Femmes live
  Cycling This year’s edition reaches what is certain to be a compelling if
  gruelling climax, the “100% Haute-Savoie” finale offering riders a last heave
  for glory. The day’s action begins on the Côte d’Arâches-la-Frasse (6.2km at
  7.1%), then on to the Joux Plane (11.6km at 8.5%), taking no prisoners on the
  Col du Corbier (5.9km at 8.5%). The climb towards the finish, at Pré la Joux,
  is steep as it passes through Châtel on the rough and tumble Route de la
  Bechigne. Plenty of drama to keep Amy Sedghi busy in the telling. 3pm
  Hungarian Grand Prix live Formula One Following a declaration of loyalty this
  week, Max Verstappen’s break clause from his Red Bull deal can no longer be
  activated, after his fourth-placed finish in Belgium last Sunday ensured he
  will not be lower than third in the world championship at the summer
  intermission which follows Sunday’s Hungarian Grand Prix. As a sidebar to the
  internecine tussle of the McLarens, quite how defending world champion
  Verstappen – 81 points off the title pace – fares will be another keen
  narrative to follow at the Hungaroring. Dominic Booth keeps you updated with
  Giles Richards on reporting duties.
