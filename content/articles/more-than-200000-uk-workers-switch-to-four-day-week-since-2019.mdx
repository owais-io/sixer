  More than 100,000 workers in the UK have switched to a full-time four-day week
  since the pandemic, in a further sign of the revolution in the world of work
  inspired by Covid, according to an analysis. Nearly 1.4 million people said
  they worked full-time on four days of the week between October and December
  2024, an increase of more than 100,000 compared with the same period in 2019,
  when 1.29 million reported this work schedule, according to figures from the
  Office for National Statistics (ONS). Campaigners and some economists say a
  four-day week benefits workers by giving them more time to relax and putting
  less strain on their mental health, while helping businesses by making their
  staff more motivated and facilitating recruitment and retention. A further
  100,000 people said they worked a part-time four-day week between October and
  December 2024 compared with the same period in 2019. As a result, the
  percentage of people in the UK who report working a four-day week has climbed
  from 9.8% in the final three months of 2019 to 10.9%, representing 2.7 million
  across full- and part-time work. The figures do not make clear whether those
  taking advantage of shorter working weeks have compressed their hours or have
  taken a pay cut to do so. The 4 Day Week Foundation, which campaigns for more
  businesses to take up shorter working weeks with no loss of pay for staff, has
  reported that more than 420 companies, employing more than 12,000 workers,
  have adopted a four-day week since the pandemic. This is based on the number
  of companies that have signed up to the foundation’s employer accreditation
  scheme and those who have publicised their adoption of a shorter week. The
  foundation is calling for a four-day, 32-hour working week to become normal in
  Britain for all employees, without requiring a reduction in salary. Sam Hunt,
  the business network coordinator at the 4 Day Week Foundation, said: “The nine
  to five, five-day week is a century-old model that no longer fits the way we
  live and work today. We’re long overdue an update. A four-day week with no
  loss of pay is about freedom – the freedom to live happier, healthier and more
  fulfilling lives.” The pandemic upended the world of work for many
  professionals, turning hybrid working into the “new normal” for more than a
  quarter of working adults in Great Britain, according to ONS figures. However,
  the continued tug-of-war between employers and their employees has meant some
  workers have had to battle for the right to keep working from home in the face
  of return-to-office mandates, let alone reduce their number of working days.
  One local authority is leading the charge. South Cambridgeshire district
  council voted last month to permanently adopt a four-day week, becoming the
  first UK council to do so. Its 700 staff are able to opt in to the scheme,
  where they are expected to carry out 100% of their work in about 80% of their
  contracted hours, with no reduction in pay. After a 27-month trial, the
  council said it had recorded faster planning applications, housing repairs and
  benefits processing. In addition, it said it had improved staff motivation,
  reduced turnover and made an annual saving of nearly £400,000 by filling
  vacancies permanently rather than relying on expensive agency workers. It is
  understood several other councils are trialling a four-day week. South
  Cambridgeshire district council had come under pressure to drop its trial by
  the previous Conservative government, which issued guidance stating it did not
  support a four-day working week in local authorities and said it did “not
  believe that it delivers local taxpayers value for money”. However, the Labour
  government withdrew the guidance in November. Instead, it said local
  authorities were “independent employers” who were “rightly responsible for the
  management and organisation of their own workforces”. Several senior Labour
  politicians, including the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, have voiced
  support for a four-day week, although the party has not embraced the policy
  since coming to power. The Scottish government launched a four-day week pilot
  in early 2024 and the results of the year-long trial involving two public
  sector bodies are expected to be published soon. Marketing and technology
  companies and charities have been in the vanguard of adopting four-day weeks
  so far, according to research by the 4 Day Week Foundation.
