  Celebrity biographical dramas are ten a penny but it takes audacity for a
  performer to emulate the famous person in question. What elevates Miles., a
  tribute to jazz legend Miles Davis, is the role of musician Jay Phelps. Not
  only does he give a credible imitation of Davis’s spare trumpet style, he also
  plays along convincingly to backing tapes of Kind of Blue, regarded by many as
  the definitive jazz album. Phelps is more than an incidental player. A
  constant presence in a production written and directed by Oliver Kaderbhai,
  Phelps plays a Davis acolyte trying to learn from the master, while the
  pressure of a record company advance looms over him. What was the secret
  ingredient, he wants to know, that turned Kind of Blue into a bestselling jazz
  album? How much did it depend on the collaborators, including John Coltrane
  and Bill Evans? Where did it fit into the musician’s history of drug abuse and
  womanising? Now aged 32, the same as Davis at the recording in 1959, could he
  ever hope to achieve as much? Answering some of these questions – and evading
  others – is Benjamin Akintuyosi in the title role. With a raspy post-op voice
  gurgling up from deep in his throat, he plays Davis as sharp, forthright, hard
  to impress but passionate in his enthusiasms. His is a tale of musical
  obsession offset by a lack of money; creative innovation offset by racial
  prejudice. With his influences stretching to Stravinsky, Prokofiev and
  Debussy, as well as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and the street rhythms of
  Afro-Irish tap dance, Davis’s musicality is more deeply felt than his
  Juilliard education might suggest. Kind of Blue, he says in the play, is “my
  pain on a 78”, an experiment he thought had failed. With projections by Colin
  J Smith adding to the period detail, the show is a fact-packed, reverent and
  loving testament to the complicated man behind a musical benchmark. • At
  Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
