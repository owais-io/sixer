  A New Zealand woman who is being held at a US immigration centre with her
  six-year-old son after they were detained crossing the Canada-US border, is
  being wrongly “treated like a criminal”, according to her friend and advocate.
  Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just
  over three years, dropped her two eldest children to Vancouver airport on 24
  July, so they could take a direct flight back to New Zealand for a holiday
  with their grandparents. When Shaw attempted to re-enter the US, Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detained her and her youngest son, in what was a
  “terrifying” ordeal, said Victoria Besancon, Shaw’s friend who is helping to
  raise money for her legal fight. “Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” she
  said. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first, they just kind of
  quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked
  white van.” Ice confiscated Shaw’s phone and transported the mother and son to
  the Dilley immigration processing center in south Texas, many states away from
  her home, Besancon said. Foreign nationals caught up in the Trump
  administration’s immigration crackdown have similarly been transported to
  centres far from their homes, support networks and legal representation. “It
  has been absolutely horrible,” Besancon said, adding that aside from the
  staff, Shaw and her son are the only English speakers, are locked in their
  shared bedroom from 8pm to 8am and are not allowed to wear their own clothes.
  “It really is kind of like being in jail ... it has been absolutely
  devastating and it’s kind of barbaric.” Shaw is on what is known as a “combo
  card” visa – an employment visa, which she obtained through her employment at
  a maximum security juvenile facility, and an I-360 visa, which can grant
  immigration status to domestic violence survivors. Shaw had recently received
  a letter confirming her visa renewal, not realising that the I-360 element of
  her visa was still pending approval. “It wasn’t until she tried to come back
  across the border that she realised only half of the combination card –
  because it’s only one physical card – had been fully approved,” said Besancon.
  Border officials did not need to detain Shaw and could have filed for
  humanitarian parole, Besancon said. Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children
  have had their I-360 visas approved, and Besancon alleged her youngest son was
  therefore being detained “illegally”. Besancon, a retired US Navy officer,
  said her country’s treatment of Shaw and other immigrants was appalling. “It’s
  so heartbreaking now to see people who, like Sarah, are not only legal, but
  who are contributing to American society,” she said, adding that the situation
  is taking a huge financial and emotional toll on Shaw and her son. “She gives
  therapy and counselling to some of our most at risk youth … and to be treated
  like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating.” Shaw’s case is
  the latest in a growing list of foreigners facing interrogation, detainment
  and deportations at the US border, including a British tourist, three Germans
  Lucas Sielaff, Fabian Schmidt and Jessica Brösche, and a Canadian and an
  Australian who were each held and then deported, despite having valid work
  visas. The union representing Shaw, the Washington Federation of State
  Employees (WFSE), has called for her release. “The trauma this has already
  caused for her and her son may never be healed,” said Mike Yestramski, the
  union’s president and a psychiatric social worker at Western State hospital.
  The union “vehemently opposes Ice practices” and the broader immigration
  policies that enable them as they contradict American values and human rights,
  Yestramski said. New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry said it is in contact
  with Shaw, but cannot comment further on the case due to privacy issues. The
  Guardian has contacted Ice and the US embassy in New Zealand for comment.
