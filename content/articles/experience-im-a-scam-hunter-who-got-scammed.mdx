  I’m of an age – 48 – that means I grew up without a computer. I didn’t use the
  internet until my early 20s, but once I did I was hooked, using it to keep in
  touch with friends. Over the years, the internet changed, but I always used
  the latest social media site to share my life with friends. Then, in 2021, I
  became ill – doctors noticed some changes in my genes and I ended up having a
  preventive double mastectomy and my ovaries removed. The stress caused my
  long-term relationship to break down. However, I tried to stay positive and
  shared my journey online to connect with others going through a similar thing.
  By November 2022, I’d built up quite a large following, and a message dropped
  into my inbox on Facebook from a man called Andrew. He said he was an army
  medic, based in Afghanistan, and he’d been moved by my story – his wife had
  recently passed away. We chatted for weeks, and I really opened up and started
  to feel close to him. One day, he messaged saying his internet was about to be
  cut off, and asked me to send him some gift cards with money on them. I
  immediately grew suspicious, and cut off contact with him. I posted about what
  had happened, and was shocked to realise this was a common romance scam known
  as trauma bonding, where a scammer locks on to a traumatic experience and uses
  it to bond with you. People started messaging me in droves, sharing their
  experiences. I was shocked and upset for them. I was working full-time as an
  NHS healthcare worker, but when I wasn’t at work I’d spend hours helping to
  track down scammers – and I’d post about the stories to warn other people on
  my TikTok account, @staysafewithmjules. One lady had fallen for a soldier and
  sent him thousands of pounds, but she had a feeling something wasn’t right. I
  discovered the scammer had stolen the identity of a real US soldier who had
  died in a car crash. She was absolutely devastated. There were dozens more
  like her. As my followers grew to more than 10,000, I started to become a
  target for scammers myself. I began to enjoy leading them along to the point
  they’d ask for money and send me their bank details – then I could report
  their bank or crypto account to the police. Because I deal with scams nearly
  every day, I didn’t think I’d become a victim myself – but somehow I did. Last
  year, I received a letter from HMRC about my yearly tax rebate. It said they’d
  added extra security to my account and I needed to send a copy of my passport
  and driving licence to confirm my identity. It sounds ridiculous now, but
  because the letter looked identical to ones I’d always received, I sent
  pictures of my documents to the email provided. A few days later, I started to
  get worried and called HMRC. To my horror, they told me I’d already claimed
  the £2,000 they owed me. They investigated and asked me about the bakery I’d
  recently opened. I can’t bake a cake to save my life. It slowly unravelled
  that someone had opened a fake business under my name, likely used for money
  laundering. I spoke to the police, and they were helpful in getting the fake
  business shut down, but further investigations showed my details were for sale
  on the dark web. I’d had dozens of loan applications made in my name, most of
  which had been rejected – but the endless attempts left my credit score in the
  gutter. Then I received a letter from a solicitor telling me I was being taken
  to court for non-payment of a £16,000 loan that had been taken out in my name.
  I felt sick to my stomach. Fortunately, the loan was written off as I could
  prove I’d been scammed. The police advised me to change everything I could;
  email addresses, phone numbers, even my name and address. I worried about
  whether to share that I’d been scammed. It’s common for people to victim-blame
  and say they’d never fall for it, but it can happen to anyone. I’m glad I did
  share what happened to me because it might help someone else avoid going
  through it, too. And despite knowing it will continue to make me a target,
  I’ll keep running my social media pages hunting down scammers – my experience
  proves how important it is. • As told to Heather Main Do you have an
