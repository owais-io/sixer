  The lineup has been announced for one of the largest-scale benefit concerts
  for Palestine since the intensification of conflict after 7 October 2023. It
  takes place at Wembley Arena in London on 17 September. Brian Eno is
  overseeing Together for Palestine, which brings together British and
  Palestinian artists at the 12,500-capacity venue to raise funds for Choose
  Love, a British charity working with 23 partner organisations in Gaza to
  deliver food, medical supplies and other support. The Palestinian musicians
  Adnan Joubran, Faraj Suleiman and Nai Barghouti are scheduled to perform
  alongside Eno and a host of top UK artists: Bastille, Cat Burns, Damon Albarn,
  Greentea Peng, Hot Chip, James Blake, Jamie xx, King Krule, Mabel, Obongjayar,
  Paloma Faith, Rachel Chinouriri and Sampha, with “one-off contributions” from
  Rina Sawayama, PinkPantheress and Riz Ahmed. Eno said: “In the face of the
  horrors of Gaza, silence becomes complicity. Artists have always helped
  societies to point out injustice and imagine better futures. That’s why this
  concert matters. It’s time for us to come together – not just to raise our
  voices, but to reaffirm our shared humanity.” Khaled Ziada, founder and
  director of the London Palestine film festival, is producing the event
  alongside Eno and Tracey Seaward, the film producer who also produced the 2012
  London Olympic opening ceremony. Ziada said: “In a world where governments and
  mainstream media have fallen silent in the face of genocide, this gathering
  becomes a chorus of resistance – where artists and communities come together
  to grieve, to rage and to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Palestinian
  people.” Singer-songwriter Chinouriri, who supported Sabrina Carpenter on a
  recent tour, called on other musicians to “join me in building a bridge to
  victims in Gaza and beyond, we must break through the privilege of our bubble
  and speak with truth and justice”. Albarn said: “Pacifism is an action. Peace
  is an action. To live peacefully requires vision and commitment … I am
  grateful for this opportunity to act in solidarity with the Palestinian
  people.” The production design of the event is being handled by Es Devlin, the
  Olivier and Tony award-winning stage designer who, as well as working in
  theatre, has designed huge pop shows for the likes of Beyoncé, the Weeknd, U2
  and Lady Gaga. Devlin is collaborating with Palestinian artist Malak Mattar on
  Together for Palestine, and said the Wembley Arena stage “will express the
  rich beauty of Palestinian culture”. Eno has been a longstanding supporter of
  Palestine and the cultural boycott of Israel. In 2017 he had a dispute with
  Nick Cave over the cultural boycott, with Cave characterising the boycott
  movement as “people that are trying to shut down musicians, to bully
  musicians, to censor musicians, and to silence musicians”. Eno replied: “This
  has nothing to do with ‘silencing’ artists – a charge I find rather grating
  when used in a context where a few million people are permanently and
  grotesquely silenced.”
