  If soldiers are going to be deployed to your city, what would you prefer they
  do: point a rifle in your face or mow your grass? This is not a question I
  ever expected to have to consider in my days on this planet, but life is full
  of surprises. As part of Donald Trump’s military deployment to address
  Washington DC’s so-called “crime emergency”, national guard troops are being
  tasked with various groundskeeping duties around the United States capital.
  These duties include spreading mulch around cherry trees, picking up trash and
  general maintenance of public spaces. The president must have been too
  embarrassed to get Four Seasons Total Landscaping involved again, so he got
  the military to do it instead. It’s a real “swords into ploughshares” moment,
  or in this case, “M4 rifles into those grabber sticks you use to pick up
  plastic bottles full of piss.” It’s almost sweet, if you separate the move
  from literally all outside context and just think about a part-time soldier
  pruning your bush. The national guard is actually trained for sanitation and
  groundskeeping, but they are usually deployed for such purposes in a crisis
  like a natural disaster or even during the height of the Covid pandemic.
  Except: there’s no natural disaster, no stay-at-home orders due to a deadly
  virus, no wildfires, no floods. The only crisis here is man-made. It’s usually
  the responsibility of the National Parks Service to beautify spaces in DC, but
  amid recent cuts by the Trump administration, the number of parks employees in
  the city fell from 200 to a mere 20, according to the Washington Post. Still,
  the guard wasn’t deployed to toss cigarette butts. This is happening because
  of alleged rampant crime in a city where the violent crime rate before Trump’s
  deployment was down by about 20% over the same period in earlier years. Some
  estimates place the cost of the DC military deployment at around a $1m a day.
  I will happily rake your leaves for half that. The guards assigned to cleaning
  up the capital are not armed and may be happy to be on trash duty rather than
  engaged in more aggressive operations. I’m thrilled for them, to be honest.
  This is the best version of an awful situation, but from my perspective, it
  could be even better. Why are they just cleaning up parks when they could be
  doing so much more with $1m a day in taxpayer revenue? Let’s really put these
  people to work. Sure, I love visiting my local park or perusing the public
  square, but you know where I really spend the majority of my time? At home. On
  my couch. Watching television. I’d toss in an extra $50 if the national guard
  would organize my refrigerator. I never can seem to keep track of all the
  produce in there and it inevitably goes bad. I’d get that $50 back just from
  the cost savings of not having to throw out old spinach every week. How about
  car repair? My passenger side door has a small ding in it. Grab a hammer and
  pop that thing back out. I need to call my mother back. She’s in her late 70s
  and is clearly very lonely. Maybe someone from the national guard can stop by
  to check on her for me. Pop a finger under her nose just to be sure she’s
  still breathing. I make a mean spaghetti bolognese from a Stanley Tucci
  recipe. The guard should come over and have some. I always make too much, and
  then I forget the leftovers are in the fridge because … I can’t organize my
  fridge. You might say that these are all things that someone else (me) should
  already be doing. Sure, I cannot deny that calling my mother is actually my
  responsibility, but is that so different from the guard entering a city to do
  what an already well-funded police department is actively engaged in every
  day? How is this different from firing most of the DC-based parks service
  members, then spending thousands of dollars to have someone else do it? And
  until my specific needs are met, how can we, as a nation, truly be free?
  Someone has to do the dirty work of calling my mother. I don’t see any
  volunteers lining up, and as a taxpayer, I’ve already invested in this
  service. The national guard has entered my home town of Los Angeles,
  Washington DC, and potentially others in the future, without anyone asking me
  (or really any other actual citizen of those places). If I’m going to be stuck
  with an unwanted houseguest who costs me seven figures every day of their
  visit, then I ask them to please do their fair share. My mom would greatly
  appreciate it. Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist
