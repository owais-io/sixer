  Millions of drivers will miss out on compensation after the supreme court
  spared lenders a potential £44bn bill for hidden commission payments in car
  finance contracts. In a blow to consumers, the UK’s highest court sided with
  finance companies in a challenge to last October’s shock ruling by the appeal
  court that found commission payments paid by buyers to car dealers were
  unlawful. In their ruling on Friday, a panel of justices led by the supreme
  court president, Lord Reed, upheld only one consumer’s case, originally filed
  by a borrower named Marcus Johnson. Cases brought by two others – alleging
  that commissions paid to car dealers were bribes and that dealers owed a duty
  of loyalty to the customer – were rejected. Johnson told the Guardian: “Even
  though I won, I just feel like it’s a dark day for the UK consumer … I was
  just hoping it could have helped others claim back what they should not have
  been charged, in my opinion.” However, the door is still open to a more
  limited compensation scheme being considered by the Financial Conduct
  Authority. The FCA said on Friday that it would confirm whether or not it
  would press ahead with a compensation scheme before the stock markets opened
  on Monday morning. It said: “We want to bring greater certainty for consumers,
  firms and investors as quickly as possible. We will be working through the
  weekend to analyse the judgment and determine our next steps. “Our aims remain
  to ensure that consumers are fairly compensated and that the motor finance
  market works well, given around 2 million people rely on it every year to buy
  a car.” The MoneySavingExpert.com founder, Martin Lewis, urged consumers to
  “do nothing” while the FCA determines the scope of a potential compensation
  scheme. He also warned that signing up with a claims management firm could
  mean borrowers lose up to 30% of any payout. Lewis said that his best guess
  was that lenders could end up shelling out £5bn-£15bn worth of compensation
  and that the number of borrowers likely to receive it would be in the
  “single-digit millions”. That would probably mean that most payouts would be
  in the high hundreds, rather than thousands, of pounds, he said. But Lewis
  said he did not believe the ruling was as negative for consumers as some
  people thought, given that a larger compensation bill could have pushed some
  firms into failure. “If those firms went bust, no one would get any
  compensation,” he said. It could also have resulted in fewer loans being
  available for consumers, including those who rely on credit. “So there was
  certainly potential consumer detriment, societal detriment, if the supreme
  court had upheld the full decision as well. So I think, certainly the
  chancellor will be pleased tonight.” The supreme court case was launched by
  two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa’s FirstRand, in an
  attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won the court of
  appeal case in October. Justices were asked to review the court of appeal
  ruling, which suggested nearly all commission arrangements – unless plainly
  disclosed and issued under full consent of the consumer – were unlawful.
  Lenders were concerned that the ruling went far beyond regulations set by the
  FCA, and vastly expanded a scandal that had previously focused on DCAs
  (discretionary commission arrangements), which were banned in 2021. If upheld,
  it would also have meant millions of people and nearly anyone who bought a car
  with finance could be owed compensation. In the UK, about 80-90% of new cars,
  and a growing number of used vehicles, are bought with the help of loans.
  Analysts had estimated that the appeal court ruling could collectively cost
  lenders – including Santander UK, Close Brothers, Barclays and Lloyds – up to
  £44bn. That would have nearly rivalled the payment protection insurance (PPI)
  saga, which cost banks £50bn. The potential bill for industry had caused
  concern among Labour ministers. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, tried to
  intervene in January before the supreme court’s April hearing, urging judges
  to avoid handing “windfall” compensation to borrowers. The Guardian revealed
  last week that Reeves was considering overruling the supreme court’s decision
  with retrospective legislation, in order to help save lenders billions of
  pounds, in the event that it ruled in favour of consumers. Responding to the
  decision on Friday, a spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We respect this
  judgment from the supreme court and we will now work with regulators and
  industry to understand the impact for both firms and consumers. “We recognise
  the issues this court case has highlighted. That is why we are already taking
  forward significant changes to the Financial Ombudsman Service and the
  Consumer Credit Act. “These reforms will deliver a more consistent and
  predictable regulatory environment for businesses and consumers, while
  ensuring that products are sold to customers fairly and clearly.” The
  Financing &amp; Leasing Association (FLA), which lobbies on behalf of car
  lenders, had warned the government that a big bill could end up disrupting the
  market, forcing some lenders to shut up shop, offer fewer loans or raise
  interest rates. There were also fears it could expose lenders to complaints
  over commission payments across other financial products, such as appliances
  and furniture. The FLA said the supreme court decision was “an excellent
  outcome” that restored confidence to the sector. In a statement on Friday,
  Close Brothers said: “Close Brothers is considering the supreme court’s
  judgment and will make any further announcements as and when appropriate.”
  Peter Rothwell, the head of banking at KPMG UK, said the supreme court ruling
  provided “a clear path forward for lenders”. He added, however, that lenders
  should prepare for what was “still likely to be a significant customer redress
  exercise” under the FCA’s scheme. The supreme court said on Friday that the
  single case filed by Johnson was upheld due to the size of the commission –
  which was worth 55% of the costs of the loan, including interest and fees –
  and because documents did not explain that a single lender was offered right
  of first refusal, rather than him receiving the best deal from a panel of
  lenders. While Johnson failed to read the documents provided by the dealer,
  the supreme court noted that the borrower was “commercially unsophisticated,
  and the court questions the extent to which a finance company could reasonably
  expect a customer to have read and understood the detail of such documents,
  particularly when no prominence was given to the relevant statements. “For
  these reasons, the court holds that the relationship between Mr Johnson and
  the finance company was unfair. The other customers’ claims are rejected.” •
  This article was amended on 4 August 2025. An earlier version said that the
  commission was worth 55% of the total loan; that should have said worth 55% of
  the costs of the loan, including interest and fees.
