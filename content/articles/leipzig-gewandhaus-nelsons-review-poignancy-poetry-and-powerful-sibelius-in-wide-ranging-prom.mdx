  Arvo Pärt has written much austerely beautiful music, but few works are as
  direct and affecting as his 1977 Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten. The
  Estonian composer, who celebrates his 90th birthday this year, had only just
  discovered the purity of Britten’s music when the latter died. Pärt’s
  six-minute tribute pits undulating string scales against the sombre toll of a
  single bell. It was a fitting opening to a wide-ranging concert in which the
  venerable Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra was put through its paces by Pärt’s
  Estonian compatriot Andris Nelsons. Emerging from the most poignant of
  pianissimos, crisscrossing lines rose and fell before the conductor’s clenched
  hands wrang the final drop of pathos out of the final chord. Isabelle Faust
  was the late replacement for Hilary Hahn in Dvořák’s Violin Concerto, and
  although she kept one eye on the music to be on the safe side, this was an
  impressively organic reading of this amiable intermingling of 19th-century
  Romanticism and tangy folk idioms. Sleek and silvery at the top, and with a
  fine line in fluid phrasing, she highlighted the music’s shadier woodland
  tones while bringing a lightness and lift to the sunnier episodes that pepper
  the rhapsodic opening movement. Faust is disinclined to showboat. Instead, she
  discovered a poetic delicacy in the concerto’s flashier corners, with Nelsons
  and his Gewandhaus players her willing and sensitive partners. The central
  adagio was warmly spun, while in the finale – a spirited Czech furiant – her
  filigree fingerwork flickered like mercury over the orchestra’s earthier
  stomp. Nelsons was generally a surefooted guide to Sibelius’s Second Symphony,
  though occasionally the music betrayed its fragmentary nature. Well-paced, if
  a little too loud too soon, he teased out plenty of internal dramatics,
  ratcheting up the tension in the opening movement. In the ensuing andante,
  baleful bassoons over a darkly determined pizzicato tread powered the
  tempest-tossed music towards its implacable conclusion. The whirling scherzo
  was tense, bracing even, while the conductor’s deftly broadened tempi imbued
  the long-breathed finale with the necessary weight and nobility. • Listen
  again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September.
