  Almost £600m was wiped off the market value of WH Smith on Thursday after the
  retailer cut financial forecasts and launched an independent review when it
  discovered an accounting blunder at its North American arm. Shares plunged 42%
  after investors took fright at the news that profits at the division had been
  overstated by £30m. The group said it discovered the mistake while preparing
  its year-end results. The retailer said it was “largely” because it had logged
  some of its income too early. The mistake relates to arrangements it has with
  suppliers, which offer rebates if the retailer hits sales targets on certain
  items and payments for marketing and promotions. It is understood, however,
  that income should have been logged in accounts for the next financial year
  rather than for the 12 months to 31 August. WH Smith said headline profits
  from its North American business – which serves the US and Canada – were now
  expected to come it at £25m, down from previous market expectations of £55m.
  As a result, the company said, it expected the group’s pre-tax profits to be
  in the region of £110m. While WH Smith did not publish forecasts before the
  mistake was discovered, financial markets had been broadly expecting profits
  of £140m. “The board has instructed Deloitte to undertake an independent and
  comprehensive review,” WH Smith told investors on Thursday morning. “The group
  will provide a further update at its preliminary results announcement.” The
  problem is believed to be contained within the North American business, which
  in recent months brought in a new chief executive, Huw Crwys-Williams, who was
  previously the strategy director for the whole group. WH Smith operates more
  than 320 stores across the US, mostly in airports, under a variety of local
  brands and its InMotion chain. It also acts as a franchisee, running stores in
  resorts for brands including Lego and Harley-Davidson as well as local brands
  such as Paradiso and Havana Sundries via the MRG business. The retail analyst
  Nick Bubb said the profit warning had “gone down like a lead balloon with
  investors”, adding that it was “reviving unhappy memories of the Tesco
  accounting scandal a few years back”. In 2014, Tesco admitted it had
  overstated profits by £326m because it had incorrectly booked payments from
  suppliers relating to issues such as marketing costs or reaching sales
  targets. The UK’s biggest retailer took years to recover from the black hole
  in its accounts. Both companies were audited by PwC, but there is no
  suggestion of wrongdoing by the advisory firm, which works with thousands of
  companies. There is no indication that WH Smith’s accounting mistake relates
  to the same issues as Tesco’s. Dan Coatsworth at the broker AJ Bell said WH
  Smith’s accounting error was a “huge embarrassment to management”. He said it
  had “tarnished what WH Smith would have hoped could be a fresh start for the
  business” after the sale of its ailing high street division to the private
  equity firm Modella Capital, which is renaming the chain TG Jones. WH Smith’s
  profit warning comes a month after the 233-year-old British business announced
  it had cut the sale price of the high street business by £12m, after trading
  at the chain deteriorated in the lead-up to the close of the sale. Coatsworth
  said: “The sale of the structurally declining UK high street division was
  supposed to free WH Smith to concentrate on its airport, train, hospital and
  service station outlets. These benefit from a captive audience, allowing the
  company to generate strong margins.” The drop in WH Smith’s shares left its
  value below £900m on Thursday morning, down from £1.4bn at market close on
  Wednesday.
