  Oasis have said they are “shocked and saddened” after a man fell to his death
  at Wembley Stadium during the band’s Saturday concert. The man was understood
  to be sitting in the upper tier of the 90,000-seat stadium – the highest
  stands of which are 50 metres above the ground – as the Gallagher brothers
  performed as part of their reunion tour. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan
  police said officers on duty at Wembley for the Oasis concert responded to
  reports that a person had been injured at 10.19pm. “A man – aged in his 40s –
  was found with injuries consistent with a fall. He was sadly pronounced dead
  at the scene,” the spokesperson said. “The stadium was busy, and we believe it
  is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or
  unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage.” The Met has asked
  anyone who has information that could help to confirm what happened to contact
  the force. Oasis said in a statement: “We are shocked and saddened to hear of
  the tragic death of a fan at the show last night. Oasis would like to extend
  our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.” The
  band dedicated the track Live Forever to “all the people who can’t be here
  tonight” during their Wembley Stadium gig on Sunday night. Liam Gallagher
  said: “This one’s for all the people who can’t be here tonight, but who are
  here if you know what I mean, and aren’t they looking lovely. Live Forever.”
  One fan, who was sitting in a lower tier, said on social media that she had
  witnessed paramedics trying to revive the man. “I was directly underneath in
  section 211. At first glance I thought it was a coat falling from the above
  tier but then I looked and saw the bloke on the concrete. It was horrific to
  see,” she wrote. A Wembley Stadium spokesperson said: “Last night, Wembley
  Stadium medics, the London ambulance service and the police attended to a
  concertgoer who was found with injuries consistent with a fall. “Despite their
  efforts, the fan very sadly died. Our thoughts go out to his family, who have
  been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers.”
  The Oasis reunion tour, with Liam and Noel Gallagher at the band’s helm again
  for the first time in 16 years, includes seven shows at Wembley and five in
  the Gallaghers’ home town of Manchester. They will then tour the US, Mexico,
  Japan, South Korea and Australia, before ending in South America in November.
