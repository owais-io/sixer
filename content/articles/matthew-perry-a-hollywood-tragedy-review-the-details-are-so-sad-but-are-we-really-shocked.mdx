  Matthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy review – the details are so sad … but are
  we really shocked?

  There is a reason the sitcom Friends was so popular from the off and became
  such a juggernaut so quickly. The writing was brilliant, and the six actors in
  it were astonishing individually and even better together. Comedy is
  alchemical, and they transmuted gold into pure joy. Matthew Perry formed one
  sixth of the troupe as Chandler Bing. Every actor had their particular
  strength and his was perhaps to be the nimblest, the most alive to the
  currents crisscrossing any scene he was in. He was the only one of the cast
  allowed in the writers’ room to contribute, and from that maybe we can infer
  he was the most naturally funny off set too. Certainly his timing, even in the
  extraordinary company he kept, was immaculate. And now we know that the
  rumours of addiction that plagued him during the filming and broadcast of
  later seasons were true. As he put it in the autobiography he published in
  2022, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, when Chandler was
  overweight, Perry was on the booze; when he was skinny, it was pills. But it
  was almost always something. A year after the book came out, Perry, 54, was
  found dead – drowned in his pool after suffering the acute effects of ketamine
  use. Matthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy, an hour-long documentary imported
  from the US by ITV, covers this sad story much as you might expect. There is
  footage from Friends’ glory days, plus telling footage of the battery of
  paparazzi yelling for his attention every time he stepped out in public. There
  are clips of interviews with his castmates lauding his talents back in the
  day, and grief-stricken ones from his great friend Hank Azaria and others
  after his death. Azaria is on the verge of tears as he remembers how Perry
  would floor his friends with laughter when he was healthy, and how so many of
  those who loved him felt they had lost him years before to his demons. There
  are excerpts from the audio version of his book read by Perry himself, which
  supply glimpses of his inner torment and memories of the aspects of his
  childhood to which he attributes his vulnerability to addiction; and portions
  of interviews where you see his charm and some of his pain. There is not much
  of his work in Friends on display, but such was – and remains – the
  pervasiveness of the show that perhaps it wasn’t felt necessary to remind us.
  Morgan Fairchild, who played Chandler’s mother in the series, contributes some
  nice and not excessively saccharine memories of him as an actor and of the
  difficulty in making a difference to someone who is not yet ready to deal with
  his problems. Still, it feels like the background is being skimped to get to
  the “good” stuff: the criminal investigation sparked by his death and the
  recent charges brought against five people for supplying the ketamine that led
  to Perry’s death. Again, this is covered much as you might expect. Talking
  heads from the world of entertainment journalism are interwoven with accounts
  from retired LAPD officers explaining how police procedures work, and the
  district attorney in charge of the case is on hand in the sharpest of suits to
  explain how they discovered – and you’re hardly going to believe this, I know
  – a network of suppliers in Los Angeles that were able to get a celebrity as
  much of his chosen narcotic as he asked for, often at inflated prices. One of
  the doctors allegedly involved in the chain messages another: “I wonder how
  much this moron will pay … Let’s find out.” The headshaking at this lack of
  respect between a man and his cash cow becomes almost comical. Amid the
  accumulating disingenuousness, the documentary does have the grace to include
  the name of Cody McLaury, whose death has also been attributed to ketamine
  supposedly supplied by one of the five suspects in Perry’s case, and to
  include a comment from one of the contributors that it was surely largely
  because of Perry’s fame that a criminal investigation was launched into the
  actor’s death at all. The film ends, however, with unexpected delicacy,
  closing with the shot of a card left with flowers at his home by one of
  Perry’s many fans. “Thank you for making me laugh,” it says. “I’m glad
  Chandler got the happy ending you deserved.” A grace note Perry surely earned.
  • Matthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now. In the
  US, it is available to stream on Peacock.
