  I used to enjoy being able to buy strawberries in the supermarket in winter.
  But that was before I saw first-hand where most of the UK’s imported berries
  come from. The working conditions of migrant farm workers in southern Spain
  were something I never thought I would see in a European country. While others
  flounder, the Spanish economy is booming, in large part thanks to unusually
  high migration levels – but too many of the people propping it up are being
  treated disgracefully. At the end of Huelva’s berry-growing season in April, I
  sat having lunch at a roadside restaurant in town, as an endless stream of
  trailers with fruit logos on the side thundered past. At peak times, 2,000 of
  these lorries leave Huelva every day, laden with berries destined for the
  European market. More than 60% of the strawberries British people eat in
  winter were grown in the polytunnels in Huelva. The 11,000-hectare
  (27,000-acre) sprawl there is surrounded by roughly 40 chabolas, makeshift
  slums housing thousands of migrant workers. According to Diego Cañamero,
  co-founder of Soc-Sat, the Andalusian Workers’ Union, 40% of Huelva’s seasonal
  work force of 100,000 are undocumented. Without paperwork, the workers cannot
  rent accommodation, and so thousands are forced to live in shacks made of
  scraps scavenged from waste dumps, with no running water or electricity.
  Cañamero put me in touch with a local union official, who took me around the
  enormous sprawl of polytunnels and surrounding chabolas. He asked not to be
  named – he told me he had been attacked because of his organising efforts.
  Spain’s berry exports are worth upwards of £1.5bn a year, so there are
  powerful forces at work here. Indeed, it didn’t take long before our car was
  being followed. At some farms, often with no company name displayed, we were
  welcomed by workers, but some were hostile, unwilling to speak to a journalist
  for fear of losing their jobs. In 2019, the union received more than 1,000
  complaints related to working conditions in Huelva. Six years on, things have
  not improved. There are farms that treat their workers fairly and pay a decent
  wage, but most don’t, my union guide said. Most berry pickers are from Morocco
  and sub-Saharan Africa, but there are also South Americans and eastern
  Europeans. Research conducted by Ethical Consumer in 2023 found that workers
  are often paid less than the Spanish minimum daily wage of about £45, and are
  regularly required to work overtime without pay. Two Moroccan women took me
  into their dwelling, a shipping container in a forest clearing between
  broken-down cars and washing lines. They spoke no Spanish or English, but when
  one pointed to a stinking hole in the floor and said “kaka”, the mosquitoes
  and flies spoke for themselves. In Huelva, the rightwing myth of migrants
  stealing jobs is dispelled; few if any Spaniards would work under these
  slavery-like conditions. This has not stopped Spain’s far-right party Vox
  proposing a new Trump-inspired plan for mass deportations. Inside the vast
  expanse of polytunnels, pesticides keep insects at bay. I witnessed workers
  wearing no protective clothing or masks while spraying the plants with these
  chemicals. The heat was fierce, but many farm bosses don’t allow workers to
  bring in bottled water, claiming it could ruin the crops. Some labourers are
  electronically monitored, and are deducted pay for low efficiency and toilet
  breaks, according to the 2024 documentary The Invisibles: Modern Slavery in
  Europe. I also met women on two-hour walks from their slums to the nearest
  shop, wary of hitchhiking because of several incidents of sexual harassment.
  Spain has an estimated 9.3 million foreign-born people, almost 20% of the
  population. And according to economists at JP Morgan, the country’s unusually
  pro-migration stance has been critical to its low unemployment levels and
  soaring GDP, as migrant workers fill the gaps left by an ageing Spanish
  population – in particular, in the critical industries of tourism and
  agriculture. Indeed, it is doing so well that The Economist named it the best
  in the world in 2024. But who is looking out for the workers who are suffering
  so that their host country can thrive, and the rest of Europe can eat summer
  fruits in the depths of winter? Roughly 600,000 of Spain’s migrant workers are
  undocumented – although Pedro Sánchez’s government has pledged to naturalise
  300,000 of them every year, which could be a step in the right direction to
  improve their working conditions. It will need a concerted effort to alleviate
  the miserable situation many workers are trapped in. The trade union has
  proposed much stronger regulation of agricultural employment, with a
  requirement for companies employing foreign workers to ensure they have a
  basic level of housing and a living wage. So far, Cañamero told me, they have
  been met with total silence. The Spanish labour ministry says it carried out
  more than 4,000 inspections in Huelva in 2022, issuing €1.6m worth of fines.
  Unfortunately, farm bosses are often alerted to these inspections beforehand.
  Soc-Sat has proposed to the ministry of labour that they carry them out
  unannounced, but to no avail. Nothing ever seems to change there, my union
  guide told me, even after 20 years of journalists documenting the
  strawberry-pickers’ undignified conditions. While Spain celebrates its widely
  envied GDP growth and the plaudits of the economic establishment, and Europe’s
  supermarkets count the profits from year-round grocery sales, the people doing
  the punishing work that supports it are suffering appalling working conditions
  and living in slums. These imported strawberries should leave a bitter taste
  in all our mouths. Tone Sutterud is a freelance human rights and environment
