  Peter Farlow’s father never spoke to him about his emotions. “That’s a common
  thing with men,” the 65-year-old says. It made seeking help difficult; for
  four years he struggled with anxiety and depression, visiting various clinics
  but never finding his way. “That’s when I heard about this men’s circle being
  set up,” he says. “So I went along with the encouragement of my wife and there
  was a group of men there who could verbalise their emotions and talk about
  things I probably have never been able to talk about with other men.” Held in
  regional and rural communities across Australia, the men’s circles offer a
  community-based, preventive approach to mental health care, enabling men of
  all ages to connect while developing the necessary skills to express their
  emotions. The circles are run by the charity Outback Mind. Farlow has been
  attending the spaces in Agnes Water, a coastal town in Queensland. “Through
  Outback Mind, [we have] a vehicle to be able to talk to other guys and build
  friendships. Women are really good at doing all this but men don’t,” he says.
  “If you’re in a good headspace, it’s amazing how you can solve a problem.”
  ‘The more honest you are, the more benefit you get’ The men’s circles are
  facilitated by local men and are held everywhere from Horsham in Victoria to
  Cygnet in Tasmania and Gladstone in Queensland. Bruce Zelinski is a
  facilitator at the Gladstone circle. He says after years of seeing his own
  counsellor, he realised it wasn’t that men didn’t want to talk; it was more
  that some “don’t have the software”. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s
  fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter “The reason [the circles] work so
  well is because men get to hear other men open up in a space that’s just there
  for that,” he says. “There’s nothing else to be doing. This is all we’re here
  to do and there’s no wrong answers. “Often I’ll hear men speak about something
  similar to what we have going on and that isolation is broken.” The challenge
  is getting the men through the door. “Some places really take off more than
  others,” Zelinski says. “Often you’ll see guys pace around the front and they
  might come in, have a look and then leave. But when they do eventually come
  in, they realise it’s a very honest space and the more honest you are, the
  more benefit you get.” Last year up to 2,500 men attended a men’s circle held
  by the charity. Zelinski, who is now studying to be a counsellor, says it is
  “extremely powerful” to see fathers attending with their sons. “You’re a young
  guy and you’ve never heard your old man open up about anything and then all of
  a sudden you get to hear this whole new side of him,” he says. “It just
  deepens that relationship.” The founder of Outback Mind, Aaron Schultz, says
  he started the foundation after losing a friend to suicide. Men account for
  approximately 75% of all suicides. A report released by the National Rural
  Health Alliance in 2021 stated that to reduce suicide attempts, men required
  support for emotional expression, help-seeking behaviour and addressing their
  traditional gender roles. “It’s more than having a barbecue and a yarn,”
  Schultz says. “It’s really about teaching people skills they’ve missed. “All
  the guys that run the circles are trained and … have clinical guidance and
  advice. We will utilise professional counsellors if need be, but we want to be
  able to empower men to be able to open up in a safe space to talk about stuff
  where they can express their emotions rather than suppress them.” Schultz
  moved to Ballarat in May with the aim of providing anti-domestic violence
  training and ELMA (emotional literacy and mindset) education which he has
  started introducing into workplaces. The Grampians region, which includes
  Ballarat, has a higher rate of family violence incidents than the state
  average. Regions still need clinical care The chief executive of the National
  Rural Health Alliance, Susi Tegen, says it is important for clinical care to
  remain the primary source of mental health support in rural, regional and
  remote communities. “We need to fund and support the infrastructure to keep
  people working and [support the] training of clinicians in the regions,” she
  says. “We know the rates of self-harm and suicide increase with remoteness and
  the big issue has been that in rural Australia you have so many complex issues
  and structural problems that make it even harder to access care.” Tegen says
  volunteer-led programs such as the Outback Mind men’s circles, while
  “incredibly valuable when often there is nothing else”, are not a replacement
  for specific clinical psychological services. They are generally run as
  not-for-profit organisations and rely on sponsors, partnerships and donations
  – making funding a challenge when rolling out programs in remote areas. “Why
  is it that we don’t have governments supporting these types of community
  initiatives?” Tegen says. “The alternative is worse for communities and
  governments alike.” Kyle de Leeuw, a senior psychologist and director of
  clinical services at Mind Life in Ballarat, says digital and telehealth
  services offer new avenues for mental health support in geographically
  isolated areas but more services are still needed. “While telehealth can
  provide privacy and flexibility, it also has limitations,” he says. “For some
  men, accessing support online can align with tendencies to avoid emotional
  exposure, potentially reinforcing isolation rather than alleviating it.
  “Digital services often fall short when it comes to crisis intervention and
  establishing the rapport that is crucial for engaging men in meaningful
  therapeutic relationships. More effective approaches often involve
  community-based programs that feature relatable role models.” Early
  intervention programs, De Leeuw says, are crucial in promoting emotional
  literacy and mental health awareness. “In a world that often feels
  disconnected and isolating, these spaces allow for the development of genuine,
  face-to-face connections,” he says. For Farlow, the circles have become a
  place to build resilience. “We embrace each other at the start of the night
  and the end of the night. And sometimes you feel you just don’t want to go,
  but every time at the end of the night you feel like a weight has been lifted
  off your mind,” he says. “You have to put yourself out there or it’s not going
  to benefit you. You will always feel good.” In Australia, support is available
  at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300
  789 978. In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and
