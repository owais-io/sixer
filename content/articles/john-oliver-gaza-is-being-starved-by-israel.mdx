  John Oliver opened his latest episode of Last Week Tonight with a look at the
  dire famine in Gaza, which Israeli leaders and American supporters continue to
  deny. Oliver honed in on former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who denied the
  credibility of images from Gaza of emaciated children. “I kind of hoped we
  were done with Megyn Kelly as a society,” said Oliver to cheers, “and
  collectively, you actually don’t have to litigate this case one photo at a
  time. He cited reports from the United Nations, aid organizations and Israeli
  human rights groups all confirming the same thing: “What’s happening in Gaza
  right now is a famine,” he said. “All the information we have points to that,
  except for this fucking guy [Netanyahu] and a few adult junior detectives
  squinting at each photo of a skeletal child to figure out if they’re the right
  kind of dying.” Oliver also referred to a 2024 CNN article in which Israeli
  finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said “it may be just and moral” to starve 2
  million Palestinians, but “no one in the world would let us”. Oliver concluded
  that Smotrich is “basically complaining that the world is cock-blocking him
  from committing genocide better. And that is the argument for sustained
  international pressure here, and that country best positioned to apply it is
  this one.” The US is “the one that gave Israel nearly $18bn in military aid
  during the first year of this war alone”. “Look, ‘Gaza is starving’ is a
  sentence that’s objectively true, but it’s also slightly misleading because
  it’s too passive,” he added. “Gaza is being starved by Israel.” Oliver then
  pivoted to his main segment on corporate crime, which is booming under the
  Trump administration. Trump, Oliver reminded, was convicted on 33 counts of
  falsifying business records; since retaking office, his administration has
  halted or dropped 109 enforcement actions against corporate misconduct, and
  even issued the first ever pardon of a corporation, for crypto exchange
  BitMex. “It is frankly no wonder experts have called this moment ‘the ripest
  environment for corruption by public officials and business executives in a
  generation’,” said Oliver. “Though to be unfair, it’s not like the environment
  was unripe before Trump took office. Republican and Democratic administrations
  have both taken a pretty lax approach to corporate crime for a while now. You
  might have noticed that stories about corporate malfeasance rarely end with
  executives going to jail or the companies getting shutting down.” Oliver
  focused on one key reason why: deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs), which
  are “basically out-of-court settlements for companies to avoid being
  prosecuted”, he explained. “Essentially, the government will come to a company
  and say ‘hi, company. Government here. You did a crime, and we have enough
  evidence to prosecute you.’ But instead of then doing that, they then strike a
  deal where if the company behaves itself for a certain amount of time, the
  criminal charges eventually disappear.” Unfortunately, DPAs also “don’t really
  do much”, Oliver continued. “And sometimes, companies that have done massive
  harm have used them to literally get away with murder.” Oliver first looked at
  the history of DPAs, which were never supposed to apply to corporations. The
  concept arose out of a 1974 law that was supposed to help juvenile and
  first-time offenders avoid prosecution in favor of rehabilitation. DPAs for
  corporations flourished in the wake of the Enron scandal, when many employees
  of the fraudulent company’s embattled accounting firm Andersen blamed the
  government for shutting down the company and putting them out of work. The
  argument for DPAs is that they prevent innocent employees from getting hurt,
  dissuade future wrongdoing, and still allow the Department of Justice to
  prosecute individuals. “But there are problems with literally all that,” said
  Oliver. For one, nearly half of companies receiving DPAs end up paying no fine
  at all, and no employees were prosecuted in two-thirds of cases. Oliver used
  three high-profile examples to illustrate the point, starting with automotive
  giant General Motors (GM), which was held liable for knowingly producing cars
  with a faulty “off” switch resulting in crashes that killed 124 people over
  several years. The government ordered GM to pay $900m fines, during a year in
  which they made close to $10bn in profit. “I’m not saying it’s nothing, but 9%
  of one year’s profits just doesn’t seem enough for essentially marketing the
  automotive equivalent of the Titan submersible,” Oliver quipped. No
  individuals were held responsible, but because the company withheld
  information, at one least one woman was convicted of negligent homicide for a
  crash involving her boyfriend that later determined to be caused by the faulty
  switch. (Her conviction has since been overturned.) “Thankfully, GM hasn’t
  killed any more people with its cars since then, as of taping,” said Oliver.
  “But other companies with DPAs have shown a much greater propensity for
  recidivism,” such as HSBC. In the early 2010s, the company got in trouble for
  allowing Mexican cartels to launder $880m in drug trafficking proceeds and
  facilitating $660m in transactions by sanctioned regimes. The company paid a
  fine of around $2bn, during a year in which they made over $13bn in profit,
  and no individuals were prosecuted. When the deal expired in 2017, the
  government dropped all charges … and a month later, the government charged
  them with rigging currency rates, and offered them another DPA. “That is
  ridiculous,” said Oliver. “At this point, it’s not even a deferred prosecution
  agreement. It’s more like prosecutorial edging. I’ll say it before and I’ll
  say it again: let the government come.” Finally, there’s Boeing, which entered
  into a DPA in 2021 following the catastrophic crashes of two 737 Max planes
  the company knew were poorly designed. Boeing agreed to a fine and three years
  of demonstrating good behavior to avoid prosecution. “It’s an agreement that
  many felt was toothless,” said Oliver, “especially given that one judge
  involved with the case later called what Boeing had done ‘the deadliest
  corporate crime in US history’.” At the start of 2024, just two days before
  their probationary period was set to end, Alaska Airlines passengers filed a
  class-action suit against the company after a door broke off a 737 Max
  mid-flight. Though the incident demonstrated Boeing was not in compliance with
  the DPA, the government offered them a plea deal and another fine. This year,
  the Trump administration downgraded Boeing’s punishment to a non-prosecution
  agreement, removing the possibility of prosecuting them over the 737 Max in
  the future. “Which is completely infuriating,” Oliver fumed, as it is “clearly
  great news for stockholders and not for anyone else.” “This is not
  sustainable,” said Oliver of a cycle where corporate misbehavior leads to harm
  to government fine on repeat. “And unfortunately, I wouldn’t expect any of
  that to change for at least, say, three-and-a-half years But it is worth
  asking for a hypothetical future, when we have a government that isn’t run by
  a pro-corruption felon, what could we be doing better to hold corporations
  accountable?” Oliver recommended making DPAs more of a deterrent by
  dramatically increasing fines and actually prosecuting executives, and more
  transparency of corporate compliance records. “But the hard truth here is, if
  we want more accountability, the government is going to have to show more
  willingness to prosecute repeat offenders, even if it affects a large
  company’s ability to do business.”
