  Getting started in the world of work was not easy for Rose Green. Having
  experienced half a dozen children’s homes from the age of 13 while growing up
  in care in north London, finding a career was the last thing on her mind.
  “Having that corporate parenting, it can be difficult,” she says. “Sometimes
  things like completing school, or uni, you’re faced with so much trauma that
  you haven’t really got the time to finish all of that. “You’re kind of
  parenting yourself, raising yourself. But you’re a child. You’re just cracking
  on doing what you think you’re supposed to do. Even today, I’m still figuring
  it out.” Despite those challenges, the 26-year-old from Camden has found work
  as an employment and training officer at the local council. After completing a
  care leaver internship, she now helps others to overcome the same hurdles.
  Green’s work will be critical not just for the next generation but for the
  British economy at large, and for Keir Starmer’s government, as Labour
  promises to fix what experts have called a crisis in youth employment.
  Official figures on Thursday show that the number of young people not in
  education, employment or training (Neet) has leapt by more than a quarter in
  the past five years to reach almost 1 million. In the three months to June,
  there were 948,000 young people aged 16 to 24 who were Neet, according to the
  Office for National Statistics. The number has increased from 750,000 at the
  end of 2019, and by about 40,000 since Labour came to power a year ago. Care
  leavers are significantly more likely to be among them. The figures mean one
  in eight young people across the country are out of employment, education or
  training at a time when Britain’s jobs market is cooling, as employers grapple
  with higher taxes and a weak economic outlook. Liz Kendall, the work and
  pensions secretary, acknowledges that Labour has a “mountain to climb” to
  bring down the numbers. “We’re making a start and I am absolutely determined
  we are going to deliver,” she says. Speaking at the Euston Skills Centre after
  meeting Green, other Camden council employment advisers, and young people in
  care, she said the government will extend a £45m scheme of “trailblazer”
  projects in eight English mayoral authorities to support young adults to find
  work. “We cannot have a generation of young people denied the opportunities
  they need,” Kendall said. “It’s not good for them and it’s terrible for the
  country as well … it doesn’t have to be that way.” The scheme was launched
  this spring, with one year of funding. Kendall says the extension until spring
  2027 will provide additional resources for the programme, which provides
  tailored job support. The schemes in London and Liverpool are focused on
  supporting care leavers. Other locations with trailblazers include the West
  Midlands, the Tees Valley, the East Midlands, the West of England combined
  authority and the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough combined authority. However,
  while ministers have promised a “youth guarantee”, offering every young person
  access to education or training to help them find work, Labour has faced
  rising criticism that its other policies have had a chilling impact on the
  jobs market. Official figures show that unemployment has risen since Rachel
  Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions and increase
  in the national living wage. Job vacancies in hospitality, retail and summer
  work – typically filled by younger adults – have also fallen sharply. Kendall
  has faced intense criticism. On the right of politics, the work and pensions
  secretary is under fire for the number of universal credit claimants hitting 8
  million. From within her own party, and among charities and campaigners, the
  government has been warned that “huge swathes” of severely disabled people
  will be hit by planned cuts to benefits, despite the high-profile U-turn on
  other changes to disability support. With a tough autumn budget looming,
  Reeves is under pressure to cover a multibillion-pound shortfall in the
  government finances, in part exposed by Labour’s retreat on planned disability
  benefit cuts. Despite offering a fresh £45m for eight youth trailblazer
  schemes, are the government’s other changes not pushing in the opposite
  direction? And might the work and pensions secretary be pressed to make
  further savings? Kendall is defiant. “I am under no illusions about the scale
  of the task. And you can’t just flick a switch and put right a decade of
  stagnant growth and poor support. “But we are putting this in place. It is
  making a difference to real people. And I will shout that from the rooftops.”
