  A federal judge in San Francisco on Monday began hearing evidence and
  arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it
  deployed national guard soldiers and US marines to Los Angeles after protests
  over immigration raids this summer. The Trump administration federalized
  California national guard members and sent them to the second-largest US city
  over the objections of the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and city
  leaders, after protests erupted on 7 June when Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) officers arrested people at multiple locations. California
  is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return
  control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal
  government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in
  the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any
  federal agent or officer”. “The factual question which the court must address
  is whether the military was used to enforce domestic law, and if so, whether
  there continues to be a threat that it could be done again,” Breyer said at
  the start of Monday’s court hearing. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prevents the
  president from using the military as a domestic police force. The case could
  set precedent for how Trump can deploy the guard in the future in California
  or other states. Trump’s decision to deploy the troops marked the first time
  in 60 years that a US president had taken such a step without a governor’s
  consent. Critics say that Trump’s actions in many ways reflect a strongman
  approach by a president who has continually trodden upon norms and has had a
  disregard for institutional limits. “This is the first, perhaps, of many,”
  Trump said in June of the deployment of national guard troops in Los Angeles.
  “You know, if we didn’t attack this one very strongly, you’d have them all
  over the country, but I can inform the rest of the country, that when they do
  it, if they do it, they’re going to be met with equal or greater force.” Many
  of the troops have been withdrawn, but Rob Bonta, California’s attorney
  general, said on Sunday that 300 national guard troops remain in the state.
  The Trump administration last week extended the activation of troops in the LA
  area through 6 November, according to a court filing by Newsom. “The federal
  government deployed military troops to the streets of Los Angeles for the
  purposes of political theater and public intimidation,” Bonta said in a
  statement. “This dangerous move has no precedent in American history.” The
  hearing comes the same day Trump placed the DC Metropolitan police department
  under federal control and deployed the national guard by invoking section 740
  of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. The US defense secretary, Pete
  Hegseth, has said national guard units would take to the streets of DC over
  the coming week. The Department of Defense ordered the deployment of roughly
  4,000 California national guard troops and 700 marines. Most of the troops
  have since left but 250 national guard members remain, according to the latest
  figures provided by the Pentagon. The remaining troops are at the Joint Forces
  training base in Los Alamitos, according to Newsom. Newsom won an early
  victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration had violated the 10th
  amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and
  exceeded its authority. The Trump administration immediately filed an appeal
  arguing that courts cannot second-guess the president’s decisions and secured
  a temporary halt from the appeals court, allowing control of the California
  national guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit continues to unfold.
  After their deployment, the soldiers accompanied federal immigration officers
  on immigration raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura
  county while marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown
  Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests. The
  Trump administration argued the troops were needed to protect federal
  buildings and personnel in Los Angeles, which has been a battleground in the
  federal government’s aggressive immigration strategy. Since June, federal
  agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the US from
  Home Depots, car washes, bus stops and farms. Some US citizens have also been
  detained. Ernesto Santacruz Jr, the field office director for the Department
  of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops
  were needed because local law enforcement had been slow to respond when a
  crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest against the 7 June
  immigration arrests. “The presence of the national guard and marines has
  played an essential role in protecting federal property and personnel from the
  violent mobs,” Santacruz said. After opposition from the Trump administration,
  Breyer issued an order allowing California’s attorneys to take Santacruz’s
  deposition. They also took a declaration from a military official on the
  national guard and marines role in Los Angeles. The Trump administration’s
  attorneys argued in court filings last week the case should be canceled
  because the claims under the Posse Comitatus Act “fail as a matter of law”.
  They argued that there was a law that gives the president the authority to
  call on the national guard to enforce US laws when federal law enforcement is
  not enough. Trump federalized members of the California national guard under
  Section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the national
  guard into federal service when the country “is invaded”, when “there is a
  rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government” or
  when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United
  States”. Breyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of
  ‘rebellion”. “Next week’s trial is not cancelled,” he said in a ruling
  ordering the three-day, non-jury trial. During the month the protests took
  place, tensions heightened between Trump and Newsom. The California governor
  compared the president to failed dictators and Trump entertained the idea of
  having Newsom arrested.
