  Defending champion Alexei Popyrin rallied from a set down to beat world No 9
  Holger Rune 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 and reach the National Bank Open quarter-finals. The
  Australian will put his growing reputation as one of the biggest giant-killers
  on the tour to the test when he faces Alexander Zverev in the last eight,
  after the top seed benefited from Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo withdrawal
  while the German was leading 6-4, 1-0. Popyrin started strongly against Rune
  but was unable to make the most of his early touch as he failed to close out
  11 break points while the fifth-seeded Dane took the first set. The
  25-year-old recovered to convert two breaks while only giving up a pair of
  unforced errors during a powerful second set before easing through the third
  on Saturday night. “I started this week not high on confidence, needing to get
  a grasp of the mental side,” Popyrin said. “But this week I kind of just let
  go of all the pressure.” “After the first set I was pissed. But when I came
  back out to return again, it felt like I was in control of the match. I told
  myself to be aggressive on the next break point that I got, and from then on I
  felt quite comfortable.” Popyrin has now won seven of his past nine matches
  against players ranked in the top 10 across a 12-month stretch of form that
  began while on the way to claiming the Canadian ATP Masters 1000 last year.
  The 18th seed has also extended his winning streak in Canada to nine matches
  before his quarter-final showdown with the world No 3. Zverev is the top seed
  in Toronto with top-ranked Jannik Sinner – the 2023 winner – and No 2 Carlos
  Alcaraz skipping the hard-court event. “I feel comfortable on these courts,
  where I hit my first aggressive shot and then can dictate from there” Popyrin
  said. “My forehand was the standout today.” Alex Michelsen is through to the
  quarter-finals after defeating fellow American Learner Tien 6-3, 6-3.
  Michelsen will face 11th seed Karen Khachanov after the Russian beat
  eighth-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway 6-4, 7-5. Alex de Minaur will take on
  seventh seed Frances Tiafoe with a quarter-final spot up for grabs, after
  Christopher O’Connell pulled out of their all-Australian third round clash due
  to an abdominal injury.
