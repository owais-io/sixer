  Politicians should work to “reduce and defuse tensions” instead of stoking
  division, a senior chief constable has said. Gavin Stephens, who chairs the
  National Police Chiefs’ Council, was speaking after weeks of demonstrations
  against asylum seekers being housed in hotels, and counter-protests by those
  who fear the issue is mobilising the far right and demonising vulnerable
  people. Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, claimed in July that Britain
  was getting close to “civil disobedience on a vast scale”. Stephens said such
  claims were “exaggerated” but the intense row over asylum seekers had caused
  “a climate of increasing tension and polarity”. He stressed he did not want to
  speak about any particular politician but said: “I guess what we’re saying
  today is that anybody in a leadership position should think about how we can
  reduce and defuse tensions, and not sow division.” Behind the scenes, his
  senior colleagues believe some rhetoric from politicians on the right has at
  best been careless at a time of heightened tensions. Stephens, who served as
  Surrey’s chief constable, said: “There is a climate of increasing tension and
  polarity in what we’re seeing, and it’s a huge disappointment to all of us
  that we’ve seen criminality creep into this protest activity. “It’s clear to
  all of us that we can see more community tension and more division. And I
  think we all have a responsibility – policing included – to set the tone. We
  all want to live in places where we feel safe, and I think everybody has a
  responsibility.” The national public order centre was notified of 3,081
  protests from June to August compared with 2,942 last year and 928 in 2023.
  Stephens said police this year were under “chronic pressure” when compared
  with last year when the worst riots since 2011 placed officers in England
  under “acute” strain. He said the need for police to attend protests meant
  they had been diverted from fighting crime. Stephens, a police officer for 32
  years, said: “I can think of a number of points in recent history where
  tensions rise, where there’s disquiet. The last two summers have definitely
  felt like that, and this summer has felt like an enduring summer, rather than
  the sort of acute one that we had last year. “My other reflection is that I
  think we always find a moment as a society, as communities, to sort of reset
  and come back together again.” Stephens stressed that peaceful protests must
  be facilitated by police and said the tensions were only in certain parts of
  the country and not at the same intensity across the UK. “There are tens of
  thousands of areas across the country where this does not register. My mum
  lives in rural and North Yorkshire. I’ve been up there for a couple of
  weekends over the summer. This does not feature in many, in many communities.”
