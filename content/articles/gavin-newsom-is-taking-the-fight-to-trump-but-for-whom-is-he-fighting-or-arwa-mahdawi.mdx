  Every time you think US politics could not possibly get any stupider, it does.
  Today’s instalment of “we live in hell, where politicians are passing around
  the last remaining brain cell” comes via New York and the latest shenanigans
  of the city’s mayor, Eric Adams. Desperate to distract voters from a steady
  stream of scandals, the latest of which involves a former aide giving a
  reporter a crisp packet filled with cash after an Adams mayoral campaign
  event, he is trying hard to flex his social media muscles. This weekend, Adams
  joined Andrew Cuomo, the former governor who is running as an independent in
  November’s election, and others in mocking Zohran Mamdani, the charismatic
  Democratic candidate and frontrunner, for his weightlifting efforts at a
  community event. Adams posted a side-by-side video on X of himself and Mamdani
  bench-pressing with the caption: “67 vs. 33 … The weight of the job is too
  heavy for ‘Mamscrawny.’ The only thing he can lift is your taxes.” This post
  was quickly deleted and replaced with one that got Adams’s age right: he is
  64. Inventing childish nicknames for your rivals? Classic Donald Trump.
  Getting basic facts embarrassingly wrong? Super Trumpy. Obsessing over your
  manliness, rather than focusing on issues voters care about? Trumpy to the
  max. Adams isn’t the only politician emulating the president’s idiosyncratic
  communication style. Across the globe, we are witnessing the seemingly
  unstoppable rise of the trollitician. From the Australian senator Ralph Babet
  tweeting tirades about “woke ass clowns” to the US vice-president, JD Vance,
  insulting the IQs of his detractors, an increasing number of politicos seem to
  be operating like attention-seeking edgelords rather than dignified
  statespeople. If it worked for Trump, their reasoning seems to go, they too
  may have a shot at shitposting their way to the top. Playing Trump’s social
  media game rather better than anyone else at the moment is Gavin Newsom. In
  recent weeks, the governor of California, clearly readying himself for a 2028
  presidential run, has been giving his caps lock key quite the pounding to
  troll Trump by adopting his social media vernacular. “TRUMP JUST FLED THE
  PODIUM WITH PUTIN … THE MAN LOOKED LIKE HE’D JUST EATEN 3 BUCKETS OF KFC WITH
  VLAD,” reads one mocking tweet from the governor’s press office this month.
  Newsom has also opened an online “Patriot shop”, poking fun at Trump’s
  tasteless merchandise. There are red-and-white baseball caps emblazoned with
  “NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!” and tank tops proclaiming “Trump is not
  hot”. There is also a Bible priced at $100 (£74). It’s sold out, but if God is
  good, and supply chains oblige, it will be back in stock soon. Some of
  Newsom’s posts have been very amusing; they have certainly generated a lot of
  publicity for him and delighted many liberals. I am no Newsom fan – he has
  flip-flopped opportunistically on transgender issues and taken a questionable
  stand on pro-Palestine campus protests – but it’s refreshing to see energy
  from the opposition. The Democrats are losing voters at a staggering rate and
  the party’s out-of-touch leaders can’t seem to pull themselves together to
  challenge Trump effectively. By contrast, Newsom seems ready for a fight. This
  isn’t to suggest that snarky tweets are the way to defeat Maga. Newsom has
  said his bombastic posts are meant to shine a light on Trump’s unpresidential
  behaviour: “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell
  should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.” But it doesn’t
  matter if you shine a stadium’s worth of floodlights on a problem if people
  wilfully avoid looking. You can’t shame many of Trump’s supporters because
  they have no shame; you can’t use logic with people in a personality cult.
  Crucially, however, Newsom isn’t stopping at mean tweets. He has shown that he
  will not just sit down and whine as the Republicans use dirty tricks such as
  redrawing the voting map in Texas; he will try to use the same redistricting
  tactics in California. Newsom has grasped what so many other Democrats are
  loth to admit: you can’t keep playing by the same old rules when the other
  side has ripped up the rulebook. Ultimately, though, being willing to fight
  isn’t enough. To win, Democrats need to show normal people that they will
  fight for them. People don’t want silly tweets and underhand tactics; they
  want politicians who will lower the cost of living and direct taxes towards
  healthcare and infrastructure rather than bombing starving children in Gaza.
  Running on popular policies and seemingly authentic empathy is what has made
  Mamdani – who is still being shunned by Democratic leadership – such an
  effective candidate. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist • Do you have an
