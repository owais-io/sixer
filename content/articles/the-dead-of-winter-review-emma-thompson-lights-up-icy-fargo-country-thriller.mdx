webTitle: The Dead of Winter review – Emma Thompson lights up icy Fargo country thriller

  From the freezing heart of Fargo country in snowy Minnesota comes a quite
  outrageously enjoyable suspense thriller starring Emma Thompson; I hadn’t
  realised what a treat it would be to see Thompson handle a pistol with a scope
  and also demonstrate where on the body you can get shot and still keep moving.
  The Dead of Winter has an old-school barnstorming brashness, some
  edge-of-the-seat tension, a mile-wide streak of sentimentality, a dash of
  broad humour and a horrible flourish of the macabre. Brian Kirk directs from a
  script by screenwriters Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, and Thompson
  turns up the accent dial to play a neighbourly and good-natured Minnesota
  widow. With her recently deceased husband, she ran a fishing supplies store
  and like him was keen on ice-fishing: venturing out on huge freezing lakes,
  drilling a hole in the ice, setting up a phone-box sized ice shelter for
  warmth and lowering the bait and lure. Her late husband sweetly took her on an
  ice-fishing trip on a certain remote lake for their first date – bittersweet
  flashbacks bring home the memory – and it is to this lake that she comes on a
  mission to scatter his ashes. Having not quite arrived at this beautiful but
  subzero spot that she hasn’t visited for some years and got a bit lost,
  Thompson finds herself pulling in to a very strange property to ask
  directions; she hears disquieting sounds from the interior and sees a peculiar
  man (Marc Menchaca) chopping wood in front of a sickeningly vivid splash of
  blood on the snow. The man curtly explains, in response to her tactless
  inquiry, that this is due to “a deer” and tells her where to find her lake.
  But it is only on leaving him that Thompson is to discover the awful truth:
  this man is keeping a teenage girl (Laurel Marsden) prisoner and apparently
  intending to kill her. Thompson is also to come across the man’s even scarier
  wife, played by Judy Greer. So has Thompson’s widow chanced upon the local
  equivalent of psycho hillbillies? Is this to be The Minnesota Chain Saw
  Massacre? Or perhaps The Minnesota Ice Drill Massacre? In fact, these people’s
  personalities and motivations are more complicated. Thompson’s character also
  has more to show us: she is a tough, resourceful woman used to the outdoors,
  used to the extreme cold, scared but not utterly discomposed at the sound of
  gunshots, and armed with a sense that, in an extreme situation, she might have
  less to lose than these people. And she also has a touch of ruthlessness: she
  knows how to trap people, how to use the lethal cold against them. The story
  rattles along, entertaining and alarming, until it reaches its guignol horror
  on the ice. Thompson’s relatable presence and likability-aura make a very good
  solvent for the concentrated nastiness of Greer’s desperate villain and what
  she has in mind for her teen prisoner. There’s a distinct chill. • The Dead of
  Winter screened at the Locarno film festival.
