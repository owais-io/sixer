  The AFL finals race went down to the wire with early pacesetters limping to
  the line and other sides flying home, before Gold Coast booked the last spot
  for this year and their first in club history with a win in the game that
  finished the home-and-away season. An evenly-matched finals series is now on
  the cards; only three wins separate minor premiers Adelaide from Hawthorn in
  eighth place – just the second time the gap has been so narrow since the top
  eight was introduced 31 years ago. Ahead of finals sign up for our free weekly
  AFL newsletter A weekend off has given each of the finalists time to work on
  their strengths and weaknesses, and us time to assess why each finalist can –
  and can’t – win the 2025 AFL premiership. Adelaide Can win the premiership
  Adelaide are the form side of the competition after nine straight victories
  lifted them into top spot as they aim to become the fourth minor premiers in
  five years to also win the flag. They have got the balance right between
  attack and defence as the third highest-scoring team in the competition and
  the second most miserly at the back. The Crows have turned Adelaide Oval into
  a fortress while winning 12 of 13 games on their home deck this year with two
  finals still to come at the venue. Can’t win the premiership Adelaide begin
  their first finals campaign since 2017 without one of their top players – and
  certainly their most dynamic – after Izak Rankine was banned for four matches
  for directing a homophobic slur at a Collingwood player. Rankine still has
  three games to serve from his suspension and needs the Crows to lose their
  qualifying final against the same side to have any chance of returning in the
  grand final. After the longest period without a top-eight finish in club
  history, the Crows had only seven players with finals experience in their most
  recent match. Geelong Can win the premiership Geelong continue to regenerate
  on the run but as finalists in 13 of their 15 seasons under coach Chris Scott
  the Cats have also been able to build experience at the business end. They are
  the highest scoring team heading into the finals with Coleman medallist Jeremy
  Cameron in rare form and sharpshooter Shannon Neale blossoming in attack, as
  Tyson Stengle and Shaun Mannagh lock the ball near goal. Bailey Smith and Max
  Holmes are a tireless duo in the midfield, Mark O’Connor and Oisin Mullin
  clamp down on the opposition, and the Cats can count on selection pressure
  with only one injured player on their list. Can’t win the premiership Geelong
  need to shift out of third gear and straight into finals mode after a charmed
  run home that included six straight games against sides already out of
  top-eight contention. The Cats brushed aside each of those lesser lights, and
  accounted for most of their fellow finalists throughout the year, though they
  continue to be troubled by their qualifying final opponents Brisbane as well
  as GWS. That pair beat the Cats twice this season, including at their GMHBA
  Stadium fortress, while the Lions have won four of their past five meetings,
  and the Giants seven of their past nine. Brisbane Can win the premiership The
  Lions have overcome the toughest of fixtures to finish in the top four for the
  fifth time in seven seasons as they seek to defend their crown. Brisbane are
  one victory from hosting a preliminary final and have a formidable record
  against Geelong, with four wins in their past five clashes. All-Australians
  Hugh McCluggage and Zac Bailey are finally getting the recognition they
  deserve, Josh Dunkley adds balance to the onball brigade, while the Lions set
  the standard for controlling games with clean disposal and making opponents
  pay for their turnovers. Can’t win the premiership Brisbane have blown hot and
  cold at times this season and there is no guarantee that they will be able to
  simply flick a switch as the finals heat rises. The inconsistent form has in
  part been due to a steady stream of injuries throughout the year with key
  forward Eric Hipwood still unavailable and dual Brownlow medallist Lachie
  Neale set to begin the finals series underdone after a stint on the sidelines.
  Hipwood might not dominate the forward half but his absence leaves 20-year-old
  Logan Morris shouldering much of the load starting against Geelong’s settled
  defence. Collingwood Can win the premiership The Magpies showed during a
  dominant 14-2 start to the season that they have the personnel and game plan
  to trouble any side. They might have taken their foot off the pedal after a
  finals spot was all but secured but with a week off to refresh and reset the
  oldest side in history should be ready to pick up the pace once again while
  turning to a wealth of experience. The Pies have the most miserly defence and
  lead the competition for tackles as their pressure and intensity lay the
  foundation for a style and system ideally suited to finals. Can’t win the
  premiership The Magpies have fallen away to lose five of their past seven
  matches as injuries to key personnel take their toll and the long season
  perhaps catches up with ageing legs. The loss of Jeremy Howe to a groin injury
  for at least the first two weeks of finals looms as critical as the veteran
  defender’s intercept marking is integral to the way that the Pies play and was
  notable by its absence during a stuttering run home. The Collingwood outfit
  that won a premiership with three finals victories by a combined 12 points two
  years ago are no longer the masters of the tight finish after going 2-4 in
  games decided by a goal this season. GWS Giants Can win the premiership The
  Giants have had strong second halves to the season in each of their three
  years under coach Adam Kingsley and this time clinched nine wins from their
  last 10 games heading into finals. They also have an ominous home record with
  seven wins from eight matches at Engie Stadium, where they begin their finals
  campaign in a do-or-die clash with Hawthorn. The Giants are the benchmark for
  turning defence into attack with Lachie Whitfield and Lachie Ash the keys to
  their slick ball movement, while the forward group led by captain Toby Greene
  has enough firepower to worry any other side. Can’t win the premiership The
  Giants have been missing key personnel on the run home and will have to hope
  any or all of the underdone Jesse Hogan, Jake Stringer, Josh Kelly, Brent
  Daniels and Jack Buckley can perform first up if made available to face the
  Hawks. The onball brigade can rely too much on Tom Green at stoppages and they
  rank third last for clearance differential this year. But the biggest concern
  is the weight of history after the Giants threw away huge leads in both of
  their finals last year to be bundled out in straight sets. Fremantle Can win
  the premiership The Dockers have surged into their second finals campaign in
  10 seasons off the back of 12 wins in their past 14 matches, which included
  beating the Suns on their elimination final opponent’s home deck. They have
  also beaten Collingwood and GWS Giants on the road which could build hope for
  a deep run after hosting Gold Coast. Luke Jackson is a unique weapon made for
  finals while Andrew Brayshaw and Caleb Serong are the centrepieces of a strong
  midfield that can call on the experience of Nat Fyfe and has the extra
  motivation of sending off the retiring Dockers great in style. Can’t win the
  premiership The Dockers can find scoring difficult at times and amassed the
  lowest points total of all the finalists while having only the seventh
  tightest defence. The midfield can lack the explosiveness of the leading
  contenders, which leaves the Dockers relying on Hayden Young – less than ideal
  as his body has too rarely allowed him to put together a solid stretch of
  games this year. The Dockers have a nice spread of forward targets but would
  want more from prized recruit Shai Bolton especially with his experience of
  playing at the pointy end. Gold Coast Can win the premiership The Suns have
  been breaking hoodoos over their two years under coach Damien Hardwick but
  smashing the biggest of them all and reaching finals for the first time leaves
  them with a free hit from here. Captain Noah Anderson and onball beast Matt
  Rowell are the key cogs in the engine room that drives much of the Suns’
  success as the best of the remaining teams for clearance differential. Dashing
  defenders Daniel Rioli and John Noble have changed the way that the Suns play
  out of the back half since their arrival last year, and add finals experience
  to a side and club embarking on a new journey. Can’t win the premiership Gold
  Coast were within touching distance of clinching a club-first finals berth
  with three games to play but took until the last match of the season to book
  their spot as pressure mounted. The inexperience of lining up in games where
  more than just four points are on the line could count against the Suns
  especially as they only had three players in their side last week who have
  previously played finals. Gold Coast lost six of 10 matches against the
  eventual finalists including a defeat to elimination final opponents
  Fremantle, who they have never beaten at Optus Stadium. Hawthorn Can win the
  premiership The Hawks have a nice balance between attack and defence as the
  sixth-best of the finalists for points scored and third-best for points
  conceded. The unusual forward line set up with four talls can unsettle
  opponents and has the Hawks as the second-best of the remaining sides for
  marks inside 50. The defence has started humming at the right time of year as
  captain James Sicily returns to form and fitness, while Josh Battle and Tom
  Barrass make their mark as a pair of prized recruits. Can’t win the
  premiership The Hawks return to finals for the second year in a row with a
  worrying record against the rest of the top eight with only three wins from 10
  matches. That includes an early win against GWS in Tasmania though their
  elimination final opponent is likely to be a different prospect at a venue the
  Hawks have not won at in eight attempts. Hawthorn have done well to overcome a
  season-ending injury to arguably their best player in Will Day but will hope
  versatile defender Josh Weddle can bounce back from his own stint on the
  sidelines in time to face the Giants or to return deeper into finals.
