  English wine is flourishing: a combination of a warming climate and favourable
  tax breaks for investors is leading to a boom in vineyards. It’s winning
  awards and attracting wine producers from the US and France who are buying up
  land, while English supermarket bubbly is becoming more affordable. There’s a
  range of English and Welsh wine out there, from brioche-scented bubbly to
  zesty whites and even juicy, berry-fuelled reds. It’s also becoming more
  widely available, and most of us will have no problem picking up a bottle from
  the supermarket, a local indie wine merchant or online. An even more enjoyable
  way to fill your glass is to visit a vineyard. The UK is home to more than
  1,000 (with over 200 wineries making the wines), so you can have a lovely day
  out, buying your favourite tipple while visiting the site where it was made.
  Many also offer accommodation, from shepherds’ huts to stately homes. I’ve
  been writing about wine for several years and have visited vineyards all over
  the world. There is something particularly exciting, though, about living in
  an emerging wine region and watching the industry develop – plus it feels good
  to support local enterprises. So, whether you’re after a night away with a
  wine tasting, or just want a nice bottle of wine for a picnic or dinner party,
  read on for my top picks. *** 17 UK vineyards to visit this summer *** Oxney
  Organic Estate, Rye, East Sussex Oxney, in the untamed beauty of the High
  Weald in Rye, is England’s largest single-estate producer of organic wine. It
  makes a range of traditional-method sparkling wines (meaning made in the same
  way as champagne), plus a still chardonnay, and a rose and a red made from
  pinot noir. You can stay in vineyard-side shepherds’ huts (which include a
  bottle of Oxney in the price), the Vineyard House (a chocolate-box-like
  cottage next to the vineyard) or the Oxney Barns, three converted barns that
  are a short drive away in Stone-cum-Ebony. You can book a stay from £350 a
  night (including a tour and tasting) – the perfect opportunity to enjoy wines
  in the surroundings in which they were made. Fancy a day trip? Check out
  upcoming tours and tastings at Oxney Estate Or stay nearby in Rye ***
  Tillingham Winery, Rye, East Sussex One look at its wine labels will tell you
  Tillingham is one of the cool kids on the block. It makes natural and
  biodynamic wines – ones made without adding chemicals, both in the vineyard
  and the cellar. It takes a progressive attitude to winemaking, blending
  science, technology and ancient practices. That approach extends across the
  estate, which – as well as vineyards – is home to a mixed farm (fruit trees,
  ancient woodland and livestock), a Michelin Green Star restaurant, a Dutch
  barn serving wood-fired pizza, and a former hop barn with 11 double rooms you
  can stay in from £215 a night B&amp;B. There are even two bell tents in the
  grounds, which come with private terraces and fire pits. Fancy a day trip?
  Check out how to visit Tillingham Winery Or stay nearby in Rye *** Ashling
  Park Estate, Chichester Ashling Park is known for its traditional-method
  sparkling wines, but it also makes a range of still wines, including an
  award-winning pinot noir. It’s a modern vineyard retreat that oozes style and
  glamour, where you can also make gin, attend a cocktail masterclass, and dine
  above the vines on the restaurant’s balcony. Enjoy a bottle in one of its
  lodges, which were built by architectural designer Will Hardie, and feature a
  cast-iron roll-top bathtub, log burner and private terrace, where you can pour
  a glass and watch the sunset over your own little slice of vineyard, from £250
  a night with breakfast included. Fancy a day trip? Check out tours and
  tastings at Ashling Park Estate Or stay nearby in Chichester *** Tinwood
  Estate, Chichester Tinwood is a family-run vineyard that grows the traditional
  champagne grapes chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier. Its crisp and
  lively brut showcases this signature blend, without being too rich and toasty.
  The Tukker family used to farm iceberg lettuce at Tinwood before they
  transformed the land into the wine estate it is today. There are eight luxury
  lodges, each with a two-person whirlpool bath, a king-size bed and access to a
  barrel sauna. Prices start at £235 a night, which includes a continental
  breakfast hamper. The lodges welcome dogs, too, so you can sit with your furry
  friend and enjoy the beautiful Sussex countryside. Fancy a day trip? Plan a
  vineyard tour at Tinwood Estate Or stay nearby in Chichester *** Oastbrook
  Estate Vineyard, Robertsbridge, East Sussex Oastbrook produces award-winning
  sparkling and still wines, made from the main champagne grape varieties,
  chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier, as well as some lesser-known
  varieties such as pinot gris and pinot blanc. Stay in the award-winning
  Vineyard Hollow, a hillside dwelling that wouldn’t be out of place in the
  Shire, with prices from £250 a night (with a minimum two-night stay) and
  additional £120 cleaning fee. The circular doors and windows open on to a
  landscaped garden with its own hot tub and views of the vineyard. You also
  have the option to stay at the new Scandi-inspired Avalon Waterside Lodge,
  with stays from £145 a night with a minimum two-night stay and £120 additional
  cleaning fee, or in the glamping field. If you feel like exploring the area,
  the estate is a 10-minute drive from another architectural masterpiece, Bodiam
  Castle. Fancy a day trip? Plan your visit to Oastbrook Or stay nearby in
  Hawkhurst *** Rathfinny Estate, Alfriston, East Sussex Rathfinny is the proud
  producer of Sussex sparkling – low-intervention, traditional-method vintage
  wines, such as its blanc de blancs 2019, which is bright, lemony and elegant,
  and its rich, apple-and-berry-laden classic cuvee 2019. If you’re coming for
  dinner in the estate’s remote restaurant, you really ought to order another
  bottle and stay over (from £120 a night B&amp;B): the Flint Barns is a
  self-styled “restaurant with rooms”, offering 10 doubles within the stylishly
  restored historic structure. For an even more homely feel, there’s the cosy,
  country-chic Rathfinny Cottage, where four of you can sleep, full and
  satisfied, after a short post-dinner amble from the restaurant. The views of
  the Cradle valley from the estate out to sea are really something. Fancy a day
  trip? Plan your visit to Rathfinny Estate Or stay nearby in Alfriston ***
  Wolds Wine Estate, Stanton-on-the-Wolds, Nottinghamshire This artisanal,
  family-run wine estate is pretty new to the British wine scene, with vines
  first planted in 2020, but it’s becoming well-known for its fun and juicy
  natural wines. Five wines are produced: the zingy, tropical Solay; Little
  Reds, which tastes of juicy cherries, blackberries and plums; the fruity and
  hoppy Hop Fusion; Pinky Pinots, a dry, still rose; and the chardonnay, a
  green-apple-and-pear-flavoured delight – all presented with colourful arty
  labels. If you want to stay over in one of its four glamping pods, you’ll wake
  to a vineyard view while still wrapped in your duvet – prices start at £125 a
  night (accommodation only). Fancy a day trip? Check out wine tours and
  tastings at Wolds Wine Estate Or stay nearby in Tollerton *** Black Chalk,
  near Andover, Hampshire Black Chalk makes small batch, traditional-method
  sparkling wines in a crisp, pure-fruited style. The producer might be known
  for a down-to-earth approach to winemaking, but if you’re planning to stay
  there via its partner Wild Escapes, get ready for an above-the-earth
  experience (six metres, to be exact) in one of four treehouses that overlook
  the vineyard. These come with king-size beds, kitchens and balconies, with
  stays from £272.50 a night. If you really like the idea of being at one with
  nature, sink into one of the open-air bathtubs. Fancy a day trip? Check out
  wine tours and tasting at Black Chalk Or stay nearby in Stockbridge ***
  Denbies Wine Estate, Dorking Denbies is one of England’s largest vineyards,
  with a huge selection of wines from sparkling to still, dry to sweet, as well
  as some more unusual wines, such as the Orange Solaris – a white wine made
  like a red, with the grape skins left in the fermentation. The Surrey Hills
  Greenway Trail winds through the vineyard: within 107 hectares (265 acres) of
  vines, you can access seven miles of public footpath. There are 17 rooms at
  the Farmhouse, and more at the Brokes (dog-friendly rooms on the ground
  floor). Room rates start from £165 a night; both properties are in the middle
  of the estate. Fancy a day trip? Check out wine tasting and tours at Denbies
  Wine Estate Or stay nearby in Dorking *** Tuffon Hall Vineyard, Sible
  Hedingham, Essex The land at Tuffon Hall has been worked by the same family
  for more than 100 years. In 2011, they planted vines and are now making
  award-winning wines, including one made from England’s flagship grape,
  bacchus, and a traditional-method sparkling white wine. Now a venue for
  weddings, supper clubs and jazz festivals, Tuffon also has a range of
  accommodation (from £150 a night), including a six-bedroom farmhouse, a
  poacher’s hut, a bothy and, most adventurously, a converted grain silo – most
  of which come with wood-fired hot tubs for stargazing dips. Fancy a day trip?
  Check out wine tours and tastings at Tuffon Hall Or stay nearby in Toppesfield
  *** Toppesfield Vineyard, Halstead, Essex As well as a classic sparkling brut
  and a bacchus white wine, Toppesfield produces a Provencal-style rose. The
  accommodation is luxurious: a Scandi-style eco villa (from £240 a night with a
  two-night minimum stay) with a tennis court, hot tub, pizza oven and nickel
  bar, all three metres from the vines. The village of Toppesfield is a
  half-hour walk, or it’s a 10-minute drive to pretty Finchingfield – among the
  most photographed villages in Essex. But with an honesty box wine bar stocked
  full of award-winning tipples from the vineyard, you probably won’t want to go
  anywhere else. Or stay nearby in Halstead *** Sandridge Barton, Stoke Gabriel,
  Devon From the east bank of the River Dart in south Devon, the Sandridge
  Barton Estate may have the best vineyard view in England. Patchwork hills, a
  glimpse of the river beyond and, of course, rows of impeccably neat vines
  covering 182 hectares (450 acres). A range of grape varieties, including
  sauvignon blanc, pinot gris and pinot noir, are grown here, producing a hefty
  selection of wines, from still whites and reds to traditional-method sparkling
  wines, as well as more adventurous natural-style wines. Guests can stay at one
  of the estate’s three properties: Sandridge Barton House, which sleeps up to
  12, the 1850s Boathouse (sleeps four) and the newly renovated Lower Well
  Farmhouse for up to eight. Stays start from £1,000 for three nights at the
  Boathouse. Fancy a day trip? Check out wine tastings and tours at Sandridge
  Barton Or stay nearby in Torquay *** Lympstone Manor, Exmouth, Devon Once a
  dilapidated mansion, Lympstone Manor is now a Michelin-star hotel-restaurant
  and wine estate owned by the acclaimed chef Michael Caines. The vineyard is
  planted with pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay, which produce
  bottle-fermented sparkling wines and, when the weather is right, small
  quantities of white, rose, and red wines, too. All classically dry in style,
  the wines are designed to pair well with food, with structure and complexity
  coming from careful oak-ageing. A total of 17,500 vines sweep down towards the
  Exe estuary, overlooked by the white manor house. Inside are 21 rooms and
  suites, and outside are six luxury woodland shepherd’s huts, priced from £450
  a night B&amp;B. With its glittering (heated) swimming pool, sun loungers,
  pool house and tennis court, you could be in California. Fancy a day trip?
  Check out wine tours at Lympstone Manor Estate Or stay nearby in Exmouth ***
  Wraxall Vineyard, Shepton Mallet, Somerset Wraxall leads its
  small-but-perfectly-formed range of wines with a sparkling rose, made from
  pinot noir grapes in the traditional method, but its still wines are
  delightfully quaffable, including the pale-hued, mouthwateringly fresh early
  pinot noir rose. It’s all too easy to embrace the laid-back Somerset charm
  here, especially when guests who are staying are greeted with a welcome hamper
  that includes freshly made sourdough, local milk and butter, Somerset cheddar
  and, of course, a bottle of wine. Its three cottages (from £100 a night for a
  minimum of two nights) sleep two, four or eight people and all have views of
  the vines that can be enjoyed from your terrace, sundowner in hand. Fancy a
  day trip? Check out vineyard tours and tastings at Wraxall Vineyard Or stay
  nearby in Shepton Mallet *** Trevibban Mill, Padstow, Cornwall Engin and Liz
  Mumcuoglu’s vision was to make high-quality sparkling and still wine on their
  working arable farm in the north Cornish countryside (think swathes of
  wildflowers, fruit trees and perhaps a tractor trundling by). They have
  brought to life an impressive range: from the traditional, such as its Black
  Ewe white sparkling, to the wild … its electric-pink Pét-Nat sparkling wine,
  which tastes of sour cherries and vanilla. The vineyard has two one-bedroom
  lodges (one of which is dog-friendly) with wrap-around terraces, starting from
  £150 a night for a minimum of five nights in the summer and three nights in
  the winter season. If you fancy a break from the seclusion for an hour or two,
  you’re only a short walk away from the winery bar and Barnaby’s restaurant.
  Fancy a day trip? Check out wine tours and tastings with Trevibban Mill Or
  stay nearby in Padstow *** Three Choirs Vineyard, Newent, Gloucestershire
  Three Choirs makes a tasty traditional-method sparkling (a very affordable
  one, too, at £20) from seyval blanc, phoenix and pinot noir grapes, but its
  bestseller is a still white blend called Coleridge Hill, which has notes of
  green apple, elderflower and freshly-cut grass. The vineyard has eight
  Vineyard View rooms next door to its brasserie, so you can handily roll into
  one after dinner. Or you can stay in one of the Vineyard Lodges, which are
  tucked into the valley, in the middle of the vines, with floor-to-ceiling
  windows on two sides for full immersion – prices start from £149 (room-only).
  Fancy a day trip? Check out Three Choirs Vineyard’s wine tasting packages Or
  stay nearby in Newent *** Jabajak Vineyard, Whitland, Carmarthenshire Jabajak
  makes a still white, a still red, a sparkling blush and a sparkling brut from
  the cool climate grape varieties seyval blanc and rondo. On the edge of the
  bluestone mountain range in west Wales, this family-run vineyard offers tours
  and tastings, where you can sample its naturally made wines. Dinner in the
  restaurant, the Smithy, is served Tuesday to Saturday from a locally sourced
  seasonal menu. With prices starting at £120 a night (with breakfast included),
  there are five bedrooms, which are ideal for an overnighter, but for something
  more spacious, the suites are beautifully decorated with a homely feel.
  Slipper baths and fluffy robes add a touch of class. Fancy a day trip? Check
  out wine tasting dates at Jabajak Or stay nearby in St Clears *** Sophia
