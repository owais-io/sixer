  Dozens of Hollywood A-listers will descend on the Venice film festival this
  week, but activists hope to shift the spotlight from the red carpet to the
  humanitarian crisis in Gaza. With an anti-war demonstration planned for one of
  the festival’s biggest nights on Saturday, questions over the biennale’s
  stance on Gaza dominated Wednesday’s launch event. Scores of local political
  and grassroots organisations are expected to join Saturday’s march, running
  under the title Stop the Genocide – Free Palestine. More than 1,500 people –
  including industry figures – have signed an open letter from the group
  Venice4Palestine (V4P) calling on the festival “to be more courageous and
  clear in condemning the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the ethnic cleansing
  across Palestine carried out by the Israeli government and army”. They have
  also urged the organisers to withdraw invitations to actors Gerard Butler and
  Gal Gadot over their previous support for Israel – both star in Julian
  Schnabel’s new film In The Hand of Dante, which is premiering on the Lido.
  Thefestival’s artistic director, Alberto Barbera, told a press conference on
  Wednesday: “We have been asked to turn down invitations to artists, we will
  not do that – if they want to be at the festival, they will be here. “On the
  other hand, we have never hesitated to clearly declare our huge sadness and
  suffering vis-à-vis what is happening in Gaza and Palestine. The death of
  civilians and especially of children, who are victims, the collateral damage
  of a war which nobody has been able to terminate yet. I think there are no
  doubts in regard to the biennale’s position on this.” Reports suggested Gadot
  had dropped out of the festival after the scrutiny, but Barbera has said the
  Snow White star was never planning to attend. Gadot said earlier this month
  that she credits a “pressure on celebrities to speak out against Israel” with
  the failure of last year’s live-action remake of Snow White. The Sideways and
  Holdover director Alexander Payne, who is chairing the competition jury this
  year, said he felt “a little bit unprepared” for questions about his stance on
  the crisis in Gaza. “I’m here to judge and talk about cinema. My political
  views, I’m sure, are in agreement with many of yours. But I need to think
  about that to give a measured response,” he said. On Wednesday morning, a
  group of activists held a demonstration in front of the festival red carpet
  promoting Saturday’s march. International signatories to the V4P letter
  include Ken Loach, Céline Sciamma, Claire Simon, Audrey Diwan and the
  Macedonian director Teona Strugar Mitevska, whose new film Mother – about
  Mother Teresa – opened the festival’s Orizzonti sidebar. Asked whether she
  would attend the march, Mitevska said that she would be “leaving Venice
  unfortunately”. But she added: “I can tell you what Mother Teresa would do.
  She would be there helping. She would be there under fire taking care of
  things. “We live in such a strange world. So much violence. We are like
  prisoners of capitalism and egoism – me, me, me. What about humanity, what
  about doing and giving? So let’s do and give.” Shortly afterwards, the Italian
  director Paolo Sorrentino, whose new feature La Grazia officially opens the
  festival on Wednesday night, was asked whether he had had any conversations
  with the film’s distributor, Mubi, over the streaming company taking on an
  investor with ties to the Israeli military. Last week, Sorrentino called what
  is happening in Gaza a “genocide”. The director said he would “like to take
  the opportunity to give the floor to somebody from Mubi who is here in the
  room”. A representative from Mubi declined to answer. The Venice film festival
  has repeatedly emphasised it has always been a place of “open discussion and
  sensitivity with regard to all the most pressing issues facing society and the
  world”. It has pointed to its selection for the main competition this year of
  Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania’s The Voice of Hind Rajab, about the
  killing of a six-year-old girl as her family fled Gaza City in January 2024,
  as well the inclusion of Israeli director Dani Rosenberg’s Of Dogs and Men,
  capturing the aftermath of 7 October 2023, in last year’s lineup. Barbera told
  the Guardian: “We are living in really dangerous times. Film-makers are
  responding with a return to a cinema of reality. They don’t always provide
  answers, but they always ask questions.” Oscar winners Brad Pitt, Joaquin
  Phoenix, Alfonso Cuarón and Jonathan Glazer, and Oscar nominee Rooney Mara,
  recently joined Ben Hania’s project as executive producers.
