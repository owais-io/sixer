  Los Angeles police have formally linked a break-in at Brad Pitt’s home in the
  city in June to a string of other burglaries at properties belonging to
  celebrities. Los Angeles police chief Jim McDonnell announced the arrest of
  four suspects, saying they were a a crew that were committing burglaries at
  the homes of “various high-profile residents” throughout the city, adding that
  “some of the burglaries included homes of actors and professional athletes”.
  McDonnell did not name Pitt but said the case originated from a burglary
  investigation on 25 June of a resident in the 2300 block of North Edgemont
  Drive, which corresponds to the date and location of the robbery at the
  actor’s home. McDonnell said: “Three masked suspects scaled a perimeter fence,
  approached the glass window and used [a] tool to shatter that window. They
  entered the residence, removed property, and then fled.” After a surveillance
  operation, four suspects aged from 16-18 were arrested, and “numerous items
  taken” were recovered. McDonnell added that the suspects were “documented or
  affiliated with a criminal street gang”. Pitt’s home, in the Los Feliz
  neighbourhood of Los Angeles, was reportedly ransacked while the actor was on
  a promotional tour for his most recent film, F1. Other well-known figures
  reporting burglaries in recent months include actors Nicole Kidman and Austin
  Butler, and the footballer Olivier Giroud, who played for Los Angeles FC last
  season. McDonnell suggested that criminals were using increasingly
  sophisticated methods of targeting victims, including wifi jammers to knock
  out surveillance cameras, and monitoring celebrities’ movements on social
  media. He also said that gangs were fully aware that juveniles (under 18s)
  were treated differently by the US justice system.
