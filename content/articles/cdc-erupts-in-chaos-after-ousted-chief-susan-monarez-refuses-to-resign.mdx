  The US’s top public health agency was plunged into chaos on Wednesday after
  the Trump administration moved to oust its leader Susan Monarez, sworn in less
  than a month ago, as her lawyers said she would not resign and that she was
  being “targeted” for her pro-science stance. Monarez, the director of the
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was ousted on Wednesday
  evening, according to a statement from Department of Health and Human Services
  (HHS) that offered no explanation its decision. “Susan Monarez is no longer
  director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for
  her dedicated service to the American people,” HHS said in an unsigned
  statement posted to social media. Her lawyers pushed back in a statement,
  saying she had “neither resigned nor received notification” from the White
  House of her termination. Monarez, who was confirmed by the Senate just last
  month, appeared to have run afoul of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health
  secretary, after she declined to support sweeping changes to US vaccine
  policies, according to reporting from the Washington Post and the New York
  Times. “First it was independent advisory committees and career experts. Then
  it was the dismissal of seasoned scientists. Now, Secretary Kennedy and HHS
  have set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and
  putting millions of American lives at risk,” her lawyers, Mark Zaid and Abbe
  David Lowell, said in a statement. “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to
  rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health
  experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For
  that, she has been targeted.” The ousting has set off a wave of departures
  within the agency, with at least three other CDC leaders publicly resigning
  after the HHS announcement. The most explosive resignation letter came from Dr
  Demetre Daskalakis, who stepped down as the director of the National Center
  for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, according to Inside Medicine, an
  industry newsletter that obtained the full statements. “I am not able to serve
  in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health.
  You are the best team I have ever worked with, and you continue to shine
  despite this dark cloud over the agency and our profession,” Daskalakis wrote.
  “Please take care of yourself and your teams and make the right decisions for
  yourselves.” Those concerns were echoed by another departing CDC leader, Dr
  Deb Houry, the chief medical officer, who wrote that “For the good of the
  nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject
  to political pauses or interpretations.” Daniel Jernigan, who ran the Center
  for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, has also quit the agency. Hours
  before Monarez was removed, Kennedy hailed decisions by the Food and Drug
  Administration on Wednesday revoking the emergency use authorization for the
  Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax that CDC experts
  estimate saved 3.2 million lives in the United States. Vaccines from the three
  manufacturers are now authorized by the FDA only for people who are 65 and
  older, or younger people with an underlying medical condition that puts them
  at risk for severe disease. Even those that qualify for the vaccines will only
  be able to get them in the US if the advisory panel, reshaped by Kennedy to
  include Covid vaccine opponents, votes to approve them. Monarez, 50, was the
  agency’s 21st director and the first to pass through Senate confirmation
  following a 2023 law. She was named acting director in January and then tapped
  as the nominee in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David
  Weldon. She was sworn in on 31 July – less than a month ago – making her the
  shortest-serving CDC director in the history of the 79-year-old agency. Public
  health experts, meanwhile, are sounding the alarm about the chaos. “What’s
  happening at the CDC should frighten every American Regardless of whether you
  are MAGA, MAHA, neither, or don’t give a damn about labels or politics. It’s
  unclear whether the CDC director—confirmed just weeks ago—has been fired or
  not. Absolute shitshow,” Dr Craig Spencer, an emergency medicine doctor and
  professor at Brown University School of Public Health, posted. “And incredible
  career professionals resigned tonight, sounding a massive alarm,” he added.
  “This is pure chaos that leaves the country unprepared.” “RFK, Jr is
  increasingly becoming a liability for the White House,” Dr Jonathan Reiner, a
  cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University,
  observed. “There is a wholesale destruction of leadership at the CDC. The
  newly confirmed Director is out,” Dr Ashish Jha, the Biden administration’s
  coronavirus response coordinator, wrote. “Most of the top leaders who run key
  centers have resigned en masse. Total implosion. All because of [Secretary
  Kennedy’s] leadership. What a complete disaster.” Maanvi Singh and agencies
  contributed reporting
