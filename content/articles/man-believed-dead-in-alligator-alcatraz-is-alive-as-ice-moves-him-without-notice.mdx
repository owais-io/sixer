  A man whose loved ones thought he had died at Florida’s Alligator Alcatraz
  after alleged delays in appropriate medical care turned out to be alive and
  was then secretly moved to the immigration detention camp at Fort Bliss, Texas
  – and has since been moved again. Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez is awaiting
  deportation in what his lawyers said he described as a “living hell”. Rivas
  Velásquez, 38, had already signed an agreement to be deported after becoming
  desperate in detention and feeling worn down in his efforts to be granted
  asylum in the US amid Donald Trump’s anti-immigration efforts. “All that Luis
  wants desperately is to get out of detention, even if that means being
  deported to Venezuela,” said Becca Sheff, senior staff attorney of the
  American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of New Mexico. “That’s what it’s come
  down to for him and for so many others.” Instead, Rivas Velásquez was flown to
  the new Camp East Montana Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention
  facility housed at the US military base of Fort Bliss, apparently without the
  knowledge of his family or attorneys. Then it emerged that he has since been
  transferred again to an Ice processing center in nearby El Paso, where details
  of the conditions and his current circumstances were unclear. Attorney Eric
  Lee, at Lee &amp; Godshall-Bennett, who is representing him, described Rivas
  Velásquez’s treatment as “enforced disappearance” and said he considered his
  client’s constant moves from one facility to another as retribution for
  denouncing conditions for detainees and seeking legal redress. “He has
  described [himself and others] being treated like animals, in unbearable
  conditions,” Lee said. He added that Rivas Velásquez had described conditions
  in Alligator Alcatraz in the Florida Everglades as a “nightmare” and a “living
  hell” and that Fort Bliss was “just as bad”. The first his lawyer or his loved
  ones knew of his being moved to Texas was when Lee received a brief call from
  Rivas Velásquez. Before being first detained in Florida in July, Rivas
  Velásquez was a media influencer living in Miami and known to his social media
  followers as Luis Frio. He was confined at the camp in south Florida that was
  recently opened by the state and has been holding people on behalf of Ice,
  championed by Trump. Earlier this month, it was ordered closed by a judge
  within 60 days and the authorities are now swiftly moving people out. It has
  attracted waves of criticism for harsh conditions by design, alleged abuse of
  detainees, denial of due process as the men locked up there await deportation
  and environmental harm. Earlier this month, Rivas Velásquez had collapsed,
  unconscious, on the floor at the Florida camp, and Sheff said that guards were
  apparently slow and appeared not to know the best way to help him. It was
  another detainee, a nurse from Cuba, who provided CPR before the Venezuelan
  was taken to a Miami hospital and diagnosed with a respiratory infection, both
  attorneys said. The Florida division of emergency management did not respond
  to a request for comment before publication. “His family did not know if he
  was dead or alive. His attorneys could not get a hold of him,” Sheff said.
  Loved ones posted on social media that they believed he had died. His
  girlfriend, Rosana Navas, posted a tearful message from Miami that, translated
  from Spanish, said in part: “He died at Alligator Alcatraz due to the
  negligence of the United States government. He asked for medical attention,
  but they didn’t give it to him. He was covered in sores. He ate only once a
  day. We just need someone to help us transport his body … his family is in
  Venezuela, distraught.” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public
  affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of Ice,
  issued a statement that Rivas Velásquez had fainted and “was taken to the
  hospital out of precaution”. The statement added that: “All detainees at
  Alligator Alcatraz have access to proper medical care” and that Ice takes its
  commitment to protecting those in its custody “very seriously”. At the time,
  Lee was convinced there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 at the facility,
  which the authorities have not confirmed. He has filed a legal complaint and
  joined a class-action lawsuit against the facility about conditions there.
  McLaughlin also said that Rivas Velásquez had “a rap sheet that includes an
  arrest for robbery in Miami”. Lee said the charges stem from a fight that
  Rivas Velásquez had with his girlfriend, Navas, during which he took her
  phone. He said his client did not have any other criminal history in the US.
  He had entered the US legally via the El Paso port of entry last year, having
  received an appointment with the US immigration authorities after applying via
  the CBP One mobile phone app. Trump shut down the scheduling and pre-screening
  app on the first day of his second term as US president this January and then
  changed it to a tool where immigrants could request removal from the US. The
  administration now increasingly regards many people who have been living in
  the US legally as suddenly illegal. Sheff said the Fort Bliss facility had
  mostly immigrants from Venezuela, Vietnam, Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba who have
  been transferred from other jails. The ACLU tried to visit Rivas Velásquez
  there but said it was denied access. “There are people who are still fighting
  their cases [to stay in the US] in immigration courts, who have not been
  ordered to be deported,” she added. Melissa Lopez, the executive director of
  local advocacy group Estrella del Paso, estimates that half of the 1,000
  detainees at Camp East Montana “have had some kind of run-in with the criminal
  justice system” but said that could be as minor as having a traffic ticket.
  Organizations that have been calling for the facility at Fort Bliss to be shut
  down complain that detainees at the camp have been limited to receiving
  phone-only legal consultations, which are not private and sometimes denied.
  Lee said communications with Rivas Velásquez at Camp East Montana had been
  often inaudible, one-minute phone calls with a poor connection. “He called in
  a panic, explaining that he had been denied access to necessary blood pressure
  and anxiety medication. He said he has not even been allowed to change his
  clothes in five days,” Lee said last weekend. “Before we could ask additional
  questions, the call was abruptly terminated.” Later, Lee learned that his
  client had then been moved from the military base and was now being held at an
  Ice processing center. McLaughlin said in a statement last week: “The Fort
  Bliss facility will offer everything a traditional Ice detention facility
  offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to
  visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally
  balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities,
  diet, and religious beliefs.” The Ice office in El Paso did not respond to a
  request for further comment. Lee said the situation was not fair. “All Mr
  Rivas Velásquez wants is to be deported, yet the government continues to
  detain him at the taxpayers’ expense,” Lee said, arguing that his client’s
  case was another example of the federal government “going out of its way to
  prevent access to counsel for detained foreign nationals”.
