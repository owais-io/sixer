  The chancellor is missing an open goal by looking at inheritance tax while
  searching for the elusive billions needed to fix Britain (Treasury targeting
  inheritance tax reforms to help plug UK deficit, 12 August). The tax needs
  significant reform to make it fit for the 21st century, but it isn’t the magic
  bullet the government is after. At the budget, Rachel Reeves could generate
  tens of billions of pounds by making tax changes that are overwhelmingly
  popular with the public and would be paid only by those with the broadest
  shoulders. Three-quarters of us want a wealth tax on net fortunes over £10m
  (backed by world-leading economists). Equalising capital gains tax with income
  tax is favoured by the majority too. The problem is that currently there’s a
  Britain for the haves, and a Britain for the have-nots. If you get an income
  from extreme wealth (often inherited or accumulated through “passive assets”
  such as property or investment), you get preferential treatment over people
  who work as a cleaner or a nurse, or in a warehouse or classroom. Just look at
  when Rishi Sunak released his tax return. He is from one of the UK’s 350
  richest families, yet paid the same effective tax rate as an average teacher,
  despite having income more than 50 times higher. That doesn’t sound fair to
  me, and it won’t sound fair to millions of people across the country who are
  struggling to get by and fed up with politics working for the rich and
  powerful over everyone else. Caitlin Boswell Head of advocacy and policy, Tax
  Justice UK • Labour clearly has the interests of the 1% at heart above all
  others. Inheritance tax is hated by most; it appears to be a tax on ambition.
  Work all your life and, when you die, the government comes along and helps
  itself. In contrast, it is easy for the 1% to avoid it, using trusts, hiding
  assets offshore and there are even insurance policies that pay out if your
  estate is hit by IHT. Yes we need a wealth tax, but an even easier choice is
  simply to equalise capital gains and dividend tax rates with income tax and
  national insurance, and remove the additional capital gains and dividend tax
  allowances, so everyone gets a single £12,570 personal allowance. Christopher
  Bowser Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire • Amazingly, there are people who think
  somebody earning £20,000 a year should pay tax, while people who inherit
  £200,000 shouldn’t. Alan Fairs Bewdley, Worcestershire • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
