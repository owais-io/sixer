  Christy review – outstanding actors and Cork landmarks shine in a moving and
  funny Irish drama
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  Here is a terrifically warm and involving Irish movie about two brothers from
  Cork’s northside; it is moving and funny, with plenty of affectionate shots of
  the iconic Knocknaheeny water tower looming futuristically over the skyline
  like a 70s spaceship or one of eastern Europe’s Soviet-era war memorials.
  Screenwriter Alan O’Gorman and first-time director and story co-creator
  Brendan Canty deliver a social-realist film with heart, featuring outstanding
  performances of sympathy and strength, developed from Canty’s 2019 short film
  of the same name. It’s tough, but capable of delicacy and succeeds in
  conveying something very difficult to achieve without sentimentality: love of
  your home town. You can come for the drama and stay for the cheeky hip-hop
  sequence over the closing credits, a final stretch of sweetness and fun that
  the movie has more than earned, and which Canty, a former music video
  director, is more than capable of putting together. Shane (Diarmuid Noyes) is
  a young guy once in care, but turning his life around in Cork with wife Stacey
  (Emma Willis), a baby and a painting-and-decorating business. It is now
  Shane’s grim task to deal with his younger half-brother Christy (Danny Power),
  a seething, glowering 17-year-old who has just lost his place with a foster
  family in Ballincollig on the other side of town owing to an ugly scrap, a
  video of which is going viral on social media. So Shane brings him back and
  lets him live in his place for a while on the understanding that he will soon
  move back out, probably into a grim hostel. Christy finds that people around
  the neighbourhood remember him, as they do his late mother – but Christy
  himself does not remember them, having perhaps suppressed these painful
  childhood memories. Slowly but surely, Christy begins to fit in. It turns out
  that fighting isn’t all that he’s good at: he has an unlikely talent for
  cutting hair, which becomes the talk of the town, especially when he gives a
  trim to local kid Robot (a nice performance from real-life Cork rapper Jamie
  “the King” Forde). But he is also in danger of being drawn into the orbit of
  his scary criminal cousins, and Shane realises that the threat of that hostel
  might be driving Christy into their arms. Where another type of movie might
  have a gravitational pull towards disaster and despair, this one doesn’t;
  equally, though, it’s under no illusions. There’s always a heartbeat of
  humour, especially when Christy helps out with painting jobs; he and dopey
  fellow painter Trevor (Chris Walley) can’t resist weighing themselves on a
  well-off client’s hi-tech digital scales in his bathroom – synced to the
  client’s Fitbit, which then goes crazy. It’s a smart, likable picture. •
  Christy screened at the Edinburgh film festival, and is out in Ireland and
  Northern Ireland on 29 August, and the rest of the UK on 5 September.
