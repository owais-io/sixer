  Donald Trump has “manufactured a crisis” to justify the notion of sending
  federalized national guard troops into Chicago next, over the heads of local
  leaders, a leading Democrat said on Sunday, as the White House advanced plans
  to militarize more US cities. Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader and a
  New York Democratic congressman, accused the US president of “playing games
  with the lives of Americans” with his unprecedented domestic deployment of the
  military, which has escalated to include the arming of troops currently
  patrolling Washington, DC – after sending troops into Los Angeles in June.
  Late on Friday, Pentagon officials confirmed to Fox News that up to 1,700 men
  and women of the national guard were poised to mobilize in 19 mostly
  Republican states to support Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown by assisting
  the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) with “logistical support
  and clerical functions”. Jeffries said he supported a statement issued by the
  Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, that Trump was “abusing his
  power” in talking about sending the national guard to Chicago, and distracting
  from the pain he said the president was causing American families. The
  national guard is normally under the authority of the individual states,
  deployed at the request of the state governor and only federalized – or
  deployed by the federal government – in a national emergency and at the
  request of a governor. Jeffries said in an interview with CNN on Sunday
  morning: “We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply
  allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part
  of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he’s
  deeply unpopular.” He continued: “I strongly support the statement that was
  issued by Governor Pritzker making clear that there’s no basis, no authority
  for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of
  Chicago.” The White House has been working on plans to send national guard to
  Chicago, the third largest US city, dominated by Democratic voters in a
  Democratic state, to take a hard line on crime, homelessness and immigrants,
  the Washington Post reported. Pritzker issued a statement on Saturday night
  that began: “The State of Illinois at this time has received no requests or
  outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have
  made no requests for federal intervention.” Trump has argued that a military
  crackdown was necessary in the nation’s capital, and elsewhere, to quell what
  he said were out of control levels of crime, even though statistics show that
  serious and violent crime in Washington, and many other American cities, has
  actually plummeted. Talking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday the
  president insisted that “the people in Chicago are screaming for us to come”
  as he laid out his plan to send troops there, and that they would later “help
  with New York”. “When ready, we will start in Chicago … Chicago is a mess,”
  Trump said. The city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, meanwhile, has claimed
  shootings have dropped by 40% in the last year alone and he and Pritzker said
  any plan by the White House to override local authority and deploy troops
  would be illegal. California sued the federal government when it deployed
  national guard and US marines to parts of Los Angeles in June over protests
  against Ice raids, but a court refused to block the troops. Rahm Emanuel, a
  Democratic former Illinois congressman, chief of staff to former president
  Barack Obama, and a former mayor of Chicago, also appeared on CNN on Sunday
  urging people to reflect that Trump, in two terms of office, had only ever
  deployed US troops in American cities, never overseas. Emanuel said if he was
  still mayor he would call on the president to act like a partner and, although
  crime was coming down, to “work with us on public safety” to combat
  carjackings, gun crime and gangs and not “come in and act like we can be an
  occupied city”. He added about Trump’s agenda: “He gave his speech in Iowa, he
  said ‘I hate’ Democrats, and this may be a reflection of that.” The speech was
  in July, when Trump excoriated Democrats in Congress who refused to vote for
  his One Big Beautiful Bill, the flagship legislation of the second Trump
  administration so far that focuses on tax cuts for the wealthy, massive boosts
  for the anti-immigration agenda and benefits cuts to programs such as
  Medicaid, which provides health insurance for poor Americans.
