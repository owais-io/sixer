  At least 91 people have been killed and 600 wounded while waiting for aid in
  Gaza over the past 24 hours, as the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, visits Israel for
  ceasefire discussions and to inspect food distribution. On Wednesday night,
  crowds of hungry people had gathered at the Zikim crossing with Israel,
  waiting for trucks loaded with humanitarian aid to enter the besieged strip,
  when they were shot. Al-Saraya field hospital said it had received more than
  100 dead and wounded after the shooting, while the death toll was expected to
  rise, the Associated Press reported. On Thursday morning, 19 people seeking
  aid were killed by Israeli soldiers outside aid distribution points in the
  central Gaza Strip and in Rafah in south Gaza. Gaza is in the throes of
  famine, according to the international authority on food insecurity. Seven
  children died of hunger on Wednesday, bringing the total number of
  malnutrition deaths to 154, the Gaza health authority said. “Dying of
  starvation is slow and painful,” the World Health Organization said in a
  statement on Thursday. “A starving child, among the most vulnerable, might cry
  constantly from pain until becoming too weak to even do that. If not urgently
  treated, a child with acute malnutrition will die.” The UN agency added that
  it would take “months, if not years” to reverse what it called a “man-made
  tragedy”. As Gaza’s famine has deepened, social order has broken down. It is
  common for crowds of hundreds of desperate people to wait for the rare aid
  truck to enter Gaza and to loot the vehicle once it arrives. More than 1,000
  people have been shot, primarily by Israeli soldiers, while trying to get food
  from the private US Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and while waiting for
  aid trucks by border crossings. The UN has said the key to stopping the
  looting of aid is to reassure the population that a constant, adequate supply
  will enter Gaza. Israel controls aid crossings into Gaza and has been accused
  of creating the hunger crisis through its blockades of humanitarian supplies –
  something it denies, alongside its rejection that there is starvation in Gaza.
  Israel recently expanded aid access into Gaza, but humanitarians have said the
  new measures will not reverse the starvation crisis and have called for
  urgent, unfettered aid access into Gaza. The UN Office for the Coordination of
  Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said on Wednesday that the amount of food being
  brought into Gaza was “far from enough”. The foreign minister of Cyprus
  announced on Thursday that his country was working to reactivate a sea route
  to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza. Cyprus had previously helped deliver about
  2,200 tonnes of aid to Gaza last year, before several incidents stopped the
  route altogether. Constantinos Kombos said more planning was needed before
  reopening the sea corridor. He called the situation in Gaza “unacceptable,
  unbearable” and said aid must be let into the territory “so that it has
  tangible, visible outcomes immediately”. As the hunger crisis worsened,
  Witkoff landed in Israel, where he met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
  Netanyahu. Israeli media reported that they discussed the flagging ceasefire
  talks and the White House later announced that Witkoff and the US ambassador,
  Mike Huckabee, would travel to Gaza on Friday “to inspect the current [food]
  distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food and meet with local
  Gazans to hear first-hand about this dire situation on the ground”. Israel
  sent a response on Wednesday to Hamas’s latest ceasefire plan, which proposed
  a 60-day pause in fighting and a hostage-prisoner exchange. The US president,
  Donald Trump, called on Hamas to surrender and release the remaining Israeli
  hostages. The group holds about 50 captives, 20 of whom are believed to be
  living. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “The fastest way to end the
  Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE
  HOSTAGES!!!” Trump had suggested on Wednesday that the US would partner with
  Israel to run new food distribution points in Gaza, but has given few details
  about what this plan would look like. The GHF has the backing of the Trump
  administration and is chaired by an associate of Trump, but it was not clear
  whether the US would work through the private initiative. Israel has come
  under huge international pressure as images of starving people have prompted
  an outcry. More than a dozen countries have condemned Israel for its conduct
  in Gaza and taken steps to recognise the Palestinian state – a largely
  symbolic move. Several countries, including Canada, said they would move
  toward recognising a Palestinian state in September. Canada’s recognition
  would be contingent on some changes within the Palestinian Authority, Mark
  Carney, the prime minister, said. Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul,
  said before a visit to Israel on Thursday that recognition of a Palestinian
  state should come at the end of talks on a two-state solution, but said Berlin
  would respond to any unilateral actions, after citing “annexation threats” by
  some Israeli ministers. On Tuesday, the European Commission proposed a partial
  suspension of Israel from its most prestigious science research programme over
  the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel has condemned the international
  censure of its actions in Gaza and moves to recognise the Palestinian state,
  which it says are in service of Hamas. The past week, however, has brought the
  sharpest rebukes of Israel from the international community since the war in
  Gaza began on 7 October 2023. It has put more pressure on Israel to reach a
  ceasefire in Gaza or face more international isolation. Last week, ceasefire
  talks seemed to completely stall after Israel and the US withdrew their
  negotiators from Doha, where talks were being held. Both parties blamed Hamas
  for the collapse, saying the group had introduced new demands late in the
  talks – a claim Hamas denied. Israeli officials have warned that if Hamas does
  not become more flexible with its demands, Israel will reimpose a tight siege
  on humanitarian aid into Gaza, according to the country’s public broadcaster,
  Kan. The broadcaster said that the military proposed expanding its ground
  operations in the territory to put pressure on Hamas to make concessions in
  negotiations. Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack in
  2023 that killed about 1,200 people. More than 60,000 people have been killed
  in Gaza during Israel’s military operation and much of the territory has been
  destroyed.
