  David Hytner was at the Emirates tonight. Here’s his report. Thanks for
  reading this MBM. Mikel Arteta’s turn to speak to Sky. “A really positive
  afternoon to start the season off at home … the team played really well …
  really confident … five goals and a clean sheet is a really good start … [Max
  Dowman’s debut] was a special moment, you could sense it … it’s how he reacts
  and deals with the situation … he wins a penalty on his debut at the Emirates,
  that’s incredible.” He also gives an update on the injuries to Martin Ødegaard
  and Bukayo Saka. Ødegaard “looks like a shoulder … he’ll have a scan tomorrow”
  while Saka “felt something in his hamstring … the other side … not great
  news.” Leeds manager Daniel Farke speaks to Sky. “It was always difficult …
  travelling here without our most important player [Ethan Ampadu] … then of
  course you wish to have Arsenal after a Champions League game or something …
  not their first home game of the season and on the back of a big win at
  Manchester United … all of their new signings were paraded before the game …
  the stadium was buzzing … they are on it … five shots on target, five goals …
  it is difficult when they are so effective … they were the better side and
  deserved to win … we know this is not a season-defining game for us.” Viktor
  Gyökeres speaks to Sky. “I’m really happy with the result … it was very nice
  to score two goals as well … there is always pressure … I know I will take my
  chances sooner or later … today I took two of them … it was a short pre-season
  for me … not too many weeks training … it was important for me to get 90
  minutes … get the rhythm … get to know the team even more … I felt more
  comfortable … you can see that.” Jurriën Timber talks to Sky Sports. “A
  special day … a nice first home game of the season … you felt the energy of
  the crowd … the team played really well … a clean sheet again also important …
  scoring two times and assisting, I’m going to enjoy this day … I don’t think
  I’ve done that [before] to be fair! … a beautiful day … my family is here … my
  brother, my girlfriend, some friends … everyone can see the potential [Max
  Dowman] has already … playing against grown men … a joy to watch … hopefully
  he will have some amazing years with us … we have to get perspective about
  things that didn’t go well … next week we have an amazing game at Anfield so
  have to get ready for that.” Viktor Gyökeres opens his Arsenal account with a
  fine solo goal and a confident penalty, while 15-year-old Max Dowman announces
  himself to the Premier League with a cameo brimful of sass and style. A
  man-of-the-match performance from two-goal Jurriën Timber, too, plus a belter
  from Bukayo Saka. A great day for Arsenal … but one soured slightly with
  injury worries for Martin Ødegaard and Saka. Leeds meanwhile will put this one
  down to experience. “With the trip to Anfield next week, even a one-game
  absence for Saka would be particularly keenly felt,” writes David Howell.
  “Something about having your title hopes damaged in a game you absolutely
  dominate feels very, very Arteta indeed somehow.” All of this, with Eberechi
  Eze still to come. Gyokeres, who scored 27 of 28 penalties in Portugal with
  Sporting, is one from one with his new club! He whips the spot kick into the
  bottom right, and it’s a two-goal haul for Arsenal’s new striker! 90 min +3:
  Dowman dribbles in from the right and is clipped by Stach. The referee points
  to the spot. What a debut the young man is having! 90 min +2: Rice stands
  around at the back with the ball at his feet. Leeds don’t press him. Both
  teams desirous of hearing the final whistle. 90 min +1: The first of five
  additional minutes passes by. 90 min: Lewis-Skelly is flipped into the air by
  Byram. Rice sends the free kick into the box, left to right, but Gabriel can’t
  get any power on his header from a tight angle. Perri claims. 88 min: Rice
  dribbles around the Leeds box in the hope of teeing up Dowman, but can’t
  manage it. Arsenal in exhibition mode now. 87 min: Stach strides down the
  middle of the park. He’s got Aaronson to his left, and Byram to his right, but
  clanks his pass into the nearest defender. That just about sums up Leeds’ day.
  86 min: Arsenal ping it around the back, just because they can. Leeds chasing
  shadows. 84 min: The Leeds fans remain in fine voice. Marching on Together. 83
  min: Byram comes on for Bogle. “What a crazy game this is,” writes Stephen
  Bradfield. “Arsenal have just paid £60m for a player - Eze - whose first club
  was Arsenal.” 81 min: Nwaneri takes the resulting free kick, near the
  right-hand corner flag. Struijk heads it out to the edge of the box. Dowman
  meets it, slicing powerfully wide left of the goal. Had that been on target,
  it was in, because Perri wasn’t in the picture at all. Dowman showing
  absolutely no nerves whatsoever! Showing for everything. What an impression
  he’s already made. 79 min: Trossard probes down the left but can’t nip between
  Bogle and Aaronson. He turns tail and Arsenal switch the play, Dowman driving
  along the right wing, and nearly fighting his way past Gudmundsson. The Leeds
  defender drags the young lad down, and goes into the book for protesting the
  award of a foul. 77 min: Should 15-year-old Dowman score today, he’d become
  the youngest scorer in English top-flight history. That record’s currently
  held by Ipswich Town’s Jason Dozzell, who was 16 years and 57 days old when
  notching for the Tractor Boys against Coventry City in 1984. Max still has a
  bit of time to play with. 75 min: Trossard picks out Dowman with a crossfield
  pass. Dowman cuts in from the right and reaches the edge of the D, before
  flashing a shot over the bar. 74 min: The slew of substitutes, along with the
  scoreline, means this game now has a vague feel of pre-season drift. The home
  fans are enjoying themselves, though. 72 min: Nwaneri barrels down the middle
  of the park with great speed. He fizzles out just before reaching the Leeds
  box, Stach refusing to budge. Nwaneri is 18 years and five months old, an aged
  husk of a man compared to young Max. 70 min: Okafor nearly gets the better of
  Mosquera down the left. Nearly. Not quite. Leeds have still only had five
  touches in the Arsenal box. 68 min: Zubimendi pings a pass down the right for
  Dowman to chase. Much excitement in the crowd as the race is run, but
  Gudmundsson holds his line and wins it. 66 min: Leeds make a double change,
  replacing Gnonto and James with Okafor and Aaronson. 65 min: Dowman becomes
  the second youngest player in Premier League history. He’s 15 years and 235
  days old; his team-mate Ethan Nwaneri is the only lad ahead of him on the
  list, having made his debut in 2022 when 15 years and 181 days old. 64 min:
  Arsenal make a triple change. Madueke, Calafiori and Timber depart; on come
  Mosquera, Lewis-Skelly and 15-year-old Max Dowman. Huge cheers greet the young
  man, of whom much is expected. 62 min: Madueke crosses from the right. Leeds
  again slip into Keystone Kops mode, falling over and failing to clear. The
  ball drops to Calafiori, who hoicks wildly over the bar. Leeds in danger of
  getting routed here. 60 min: Arsenal, the job already done, stroke it around
  the back awhile. They’ll certainly want to take any remaining heat out of the
  game, having already suffered a couple of worrying injuries to Odegaard and
  Saka. 58 min: VAR has a look, just in case Saliba handled, but there’s no
  problem there. The goal stands. Leeds respond with a double change, sending on
  Longstaff and Nmecha for Tanaka and Piroe. Madueke’s low shot is deflected
  wide left of the target. The resulting corner isn’t dealt with by Leeds at
  all. Rice curls into a crowded six-yard box. Timber wins a header. Saliba and
  Struijk both stick out a chest at the ball. The ball drops again to Timber,
  who leaning back pokes home with his studs. Scrappy, messy, but they all
  count! 54 min: Saka had reared up mid-dribble. The feared hop and skip that
  suggests a possible hamstring problem. He was feeling the underside of his
  left thigh. As he leaves the pitch, he has a word with Mikel Arteta. Both men
  look a little concerned. Hopefully more precautionary than anything serious,
  but time will tell. 53 min: A pained look in Saka’s eye as he gingerly feels
  his left leg. He blows out his cheeks in frustration as he slowly limps off.
  Another few shakes of the head. Trossard comes on in his place. 51 min: … but
  the joyous mood is suddenly dampened when Saka goes down. He sits on the turf
  shaking his head sadly. This doesn’t look promising. 50 min: That’s got the
  crowd going, a fine solo effort that’s celebrated with a mixture of joy and
  relief. The former Sporting Clube scoring sensation has lift-off. Gyokeres
  didn’t do much at Old Trafford last week; he didn’t do much in the first half
  today. But he’s suddenly sprung to life, and in some style! He chases a long
  pass down the left and enters the box. He takes a couple of touches before
  powering his way past Struijk and swivelling an unstoppable drive into the
  bottom left! His Arsenal career is go! 47 min: Saka dribbles his way past
  Gudmundsson down the right but overhits his cross. Calafiori tries
  unsuccessfully to keep the move going on the left flank. 46 min: Arsenal are
  immediately on the front foot, their press forcing Tanaka into conceding a
  throw deep in Leeds territory. Calafiori launches a long one into the mixer
  but the visitors clear their lines easily enough. Arsenal get the second half
  started. No changes. Half-time entertainment. Crystal Palace bid farewell to
  their FA Cup final hero. Arsenal have had two attempts on target. Two goals.
  The sort of clinical behaviour that wins titles. 45 min +3: That’ll have
  cheered Mikel Arteta’s mood. Saka sprinkling some necessary stardust on an
  otherwise middling performance. Out of nowhere, an absolute belter! Rice
  steals the ball off Gruev, 30 yards from the Leeds goal, and feeds Timber, who
  slips Saka into the box down the inside-right. Saka’s got Gyokeres in the
  middle, waiting for a tap-in, but instead goes for goal himself, roofing a
  fierce shot across Perri from a tight angle! The keeper, ostensibly covering
  his near post, had no chance, such was the ferocity of the shot. Wow! 45 min:
  There will be three additional first-half minutes. 43 min: Arsenal may be
  leading, but their manager isn’t happy. He’s throwing a lot of semaphore
  shapes in his technical area, and telling his players what’s what. 41 min:
  Nope, and when the ball’s hoofed clear, Madueke gets the better of Stach in a
  footrace down the inside-left channel before hammering a shot goalwards. Perri
  parries, then the whistle goes for a generous free kick to Leeds, Madueke
  having gently put a hand on his opponent’s shoulder. Stach got away with some
  timid play there. 40 min: Bogle barges his way down the right flank. He has
  his foot trodden on by Calafiori, who is fortunate not to go into the book.
  But it’s a free kick, and a chance for Leeds to line up on the edge of the
  Arsenal box. Can they hoist the hosts by their own set-piece petard? 38 min:
  Odegaard can’t continue. He makes way for Nwaneri and trudges off looking
  glum. 37 min: Madueke crosses from the left. Rodon half clears. Zubimendi
  meets the dropping ball and volleys it towards Holloway Road. 36 min: That
  goal came at a good time for Arsenal, with their fans getting a little
  agitated as the team ran out of ideas in open play. Now they’re in full voice:
  1-0 to the Arsenal, as the old classic goes. Rice sends a fierce in-swinger
  into a crowded six-yard box. Timber meets it, glancing the ball across Perri
  and into the right-hand side of the net. Simple as that! It’s not breaking
  news, but they’re damn good at corners. 33 min: Calafiori wins a corner down
  the left. Time for one of Arsenal’s famous set-pieces. And … 32 min: Odegaard
  has the chance to play in Zubimendi down the right, but turns tail and sends
  the ball back to his defenders. Soon enough the ball’s at Raya’s feet. A few
  grumbles from the home fans, who may be wondering what happened to that fast
  start. 30 min: Calafiori has the chance to release Madueke down the left but
  overcooks the pass, the ball sent carelessly out for a goal kick. On the
  touchline, Mikel Arteta frowns quite a lot, and he’s not the only one. “This
  is all a bit tame from Arsenal,” writes Charles Antaki. “Perhaps the players
  have been up all night reading about the new team-mate. A bit of fizz
  required.” 29 min: … and so he comes back on. But he doesn’t look totally
  happy. 28 min: Odegaard’s feeling that right shoulder. It looks like he’s
  walking off, but then gives Mikel Arteta the thumbs-up. He wants to continue.
  27 min: Odegaard sits down on the pitch and asks for the physio, who comes on
  and checks that shoulder. 26 min: Now it’s Leeds’ turn to stroke it around
  slowly. They’ll be happy with the way this match has panned out so far. 24
  min: Arsenal’s early energy has dropped a little, and Leeds look slightly more
  comfortable as a result. Meanwhile Russell Yong’s first reaction to seeing the
  news of Eze’s signing break just before kick-off was: “What, no on-pitch
  contract signing a la Bryan Robson in 1981?! Men in suits crowded around a
  tiny table, fold-out chairs, some awkward ball-juggling in a suit and tie
  afterward? Game’s gone!” 22 min: Leeds have come alive. James advances down
  the right and reaches the byline, looking to find Gnonto at the near post.
  Gnonto can’t force the ball past Raya, who spreads himself bravely to block
  and takes a whack for his trouble. He’s up and about soon enough, able to
  restart the game with a goal kick. 20 min: … Struijk wins a header on the
  penalty spot and powers it straight at Raya, who tips over with a strong hand.
  Either side of the keeper and that was surely a goal. Nothing comes of the
  second corner. 19 min: … and so having said that, Leeds bust out of their
  half. James again runs at Calafiori down the right, and this time his low shot
  deflects out for a corner. From which … 18 min: Madueke slips forward for
  Gyokeres down the inside-left channel, but the pass is all wrong and Bogle can
  intercept and clear. Leeds are struggling to get out of their half. 16 min:
  From the restart, Leeds play themselves into trouble, Perri and Struijk
  faffing around with some unnecessary short passes. Zubimendi spots what’s
  unfolding, latching onto Struijk’s attempt to play upfield for Stach, and
  toe-pokes to Gyokeres, free on the penalty spot. Gyokeres has more time than
  he realises, and on the swivel, swipes a first-time shot wide left. Arsenal
  should be leading. 15 min: Rice takes the resulting free kick, sending a
  diagonal ball towards Gabriel on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box.
  Gabriel’s header sails harmlessly wide right. 14 min: Odegaard spins Stach,
  who barges him over from behind. The Arsenal captain lands awkwardly on his
  shoulder, and stays down grimacing awhile, but thankfully gets back up soon
  enough. 12 min: … and now they go long, but Gabriel is too strong for Piroe in
  the chase down the middle. He shepherds the ball back to Raya. 11 min: Leeds
  finally show in attack, James cutting in from the right and battering a low
  shot that’s blocked by Calafiori. 10 min: Arsenal waste another free kick,
  Odegaard witlessly hoofing it into a crowded box. But the hosts come again.
  First Calafiori flops over near James, and cheekily claims a penalty. He
  doesn’t get it. Rice then crosses from the left, but Saka can’t meet it with
  his head. Leeds finally clear their lines. 9 min: Perri dallies with the ball
  at his feet and is hounded by Gyokeres, forcing a shanked clearance. Bogle
  keeps it in play with a header on the touchline, but Madueke races off with
  it. Bogle responds by clipping Madueke from behind, just outside the box. He
  goes into the book, and will have a long evening ahead of him. 8 min: Saka
  busies himself down the right and cuts back for Odegaard, who drags a shot
  wide right from the edge of the box. Perri had it covered. 7 min: Gudmundsson
  clumsily clanks into Zubimendi. Free kick to Arsenal, just to the right of the
  D. A chance to stick one into the box, but they opt to play it short and waste
  it. 5 min: Leeds haven’t had much of a sniff yet. 4 min: James stands on the
  ball in the centre circle, allowing Rice to steam off with it. Rice lays off
  to Odegaard, who tries a drive from distance. That’s blocked as well. Arsenal
  have started briskly. 3 min: Calafiori feeds Madueke down the left wing and
  keeps going. He gets the ball back as he enters the box on the overlap, but
  his cross, intended for Gyokeres in the middle, is no good. Blocked and
  cleared. But it’s a promising start by Madueke, who is stationed on his
  less-favoured flank. 2 min: Timber finds Madueke on the left with a raking
  crossfield pass. Madueke sends in a cross-cum-shot that’s easy pickings for
  Perri in the Leeds goal. Leeds get the ball rolling. Arsenal soon take it off
  them. … and now the players ready for tonight emerge. Arsenal in their
  traditional red and white, Leeds in second-choice blue. A genuine buzz in the
  stadium, a heady mix of first-home-fixture-of-the-season excitement and
  new-signing thrill. We’ll be off soon, but just before kick-off, there’s a
  moment of applause in memory of former Arsenal director and board member
  Richard Carr, who died recently. Ebere Eze, Arsenal’s new number 10, casually
  saunters out of the tunnel with his new shirt on. A broad smile then a laugh
  as he soaks up the love. Quite the ovation. He’s signed too late to feature
  this evening, but he’ll be available for Arsenal’s trip to Anfield next
  weekend. Daniel Farke talks to Sky Sports. “No doubt we are playing one of the
  best sides … maybe the best side in terms of consistency … we know there will
  be difficult parts of the game … we must be rock-solid … suffer together … but
  it won’t be enough to just defend for 90-plus minutes … it’s also important
  that we have periods when we control the ball … play our game … we stick to
  our DNA … physicality … good in both boxes … still play football.” Some
  breaking news coming out of the Emirates: Arsenal have just completed the
  signing of Crystal Palace and England winger Eberechi Eze on a long-term
  contract. “We are absolutely delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal,” says
  Mikel Arteta. “He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new
  dimension in our attacking game. “What stands out just as much as his talent
  and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his
  career to get where he is today. His journey, his mentality, and his ambition
  are exactly what we want in our team.” Eberechi will be given the number 10
  shirt. He will meet his new team-mates after tonight’s game. Mikel Arteta
  speaks to Sky Sports. “We have options … every game we will look at potential
  advantages we could have … we have resources throughout the game to change
  things … [15-year-old Max Dowman] has earned the right to be on the bench …
  you see already the enthusiasm and joy of the fans … we have the chance to
  create something very important.” Street art seems to be the order of the day
  on the bustling avenues that surround the Emirates Stadium. Here we see fans
  flocking to study minimalist satire Trophy Cabinet (2025, paint on brick). The
  controversial painting hangs in a location previously reserved for All Roads
  Lead Home, a Bansky-style mural depicting Eberechi Eze. Meanwhile, stationed
  outside a nearby pizzeria, this typographical piece contemplates themes of
  existential angst and unrequited desire. Do you want some chilli oil with your
  crude sloganeering? Arsenal make two changes to their starting XI after the
  1-0 win at Manchester United. Jurriën Timber replaces the injured Ben White in
  defence, while Noni Madueke comes in for the benched Gabriel Martinelli. Leeds
  United also won their opening game 1-0, at home to Everton last Monday. They
  make one change to their starting line-up, Ilia Gruev replacing their injured
  captain Ethan Ampadu. Arsenal: Raya, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori,
  Odegaard, Zubimendi, Rice, Saka, Gyokeres, Madueke. Subs: Mosquera,
  Arrizabalaga, Kiwior, Trossard, Nwaneri, Merino, Lewis-Skelly, Dowman,
  Martinelli. Leeds United: Lucas Perri, Bogle, Rodon, Struijk, Gudmundsson,
  Tanaka, Gruev, Stach, James, Piroe, Gnonto. Subs: Darlow, Longstaff, Aaronson,
  Nmecha, Bijol, Okafor, Harrison, Bornauw, Byram. Referee: Jarred Gillett
  (Australia). Welcome to a rematch of the 1972 FA Cup final, which Leeds United
  won 1-0 thanks to a goal from Sniffer Clarke. Leeds fans are advised to keep
  thinking about that, because more up-to-date data very much does not skew in
  their favour. In the last 20 years, these two clubs have met 11 times. Arsenal
  have won nine of the matches, scoring four goals on three separate occasions
  and 23 overall. Leeds have won none, scoring just seven goals in total. Pull
  the focus back just one more year, to the 2003-04 season, and we find another
  three wins for Arsenal: two 4-1s and a 5-0. So throw in Arsenal’s genuine
  title hopes and newly promoted Leeds’ more modest aims, and everything points
  to a home banker. But football is football, so you just never know. Kick-off
  is at 5.30pm UK time. It’s on!

They’ll certainly want to take any remaining heat out of the game, having already suffered a couple of worrying injuries to Odegaard and Saka. 58 min: VAR has a look, just in case Saliba handled, but there’s no problem there. The goal stands. Leeds respond with a double change, sending on Longstaff and Nmecha for Tanaka and Piroe. Madueke’s low shot is deflected wide left of the target. The resulting corner isn’t dealt with by Leeds at all. Rice curls into a crowded six-yard box. Timber wins a header. Saliba and Struijk both stick out a chest at the ball. The ball drops again to Timber, who leaning back pokes home with his studs. Scrappy, messy, but they all count! 54 min: Saka had reared up mid-dribble. The feared hop and skip that suggests a possible hamstring problem. He was feeling the underside of his left thigh. As he leaves the pitch, he has a word with Mikel Arteta. Both men look a little concerned. Hopefully more precautionary than anything serious, but time will tell. 53 min: A pained look in Saka’s eye as he gingerly feels his left leg. He blows out his cheeks in frustration as he slowly limps off. Another few shakes of the head. Trossard comes on in his place. 51 min: … but the joyous mood is suddenly dampened when Saka goes down. He sits on the turf shaking his head sadly. This doesn’t look promising. 50 min: That’s got the crowd going, a fine solo effort that’s celebrated with a mixture of joy and relief. The former Sporting Clube scoring sensation has lift-off. Gyokeres didn’t do much at Old Trafford last week; he didn’t do much in the first half today. But he’s suddenly sprung to life, and in some style! He chases a long pass down the left and enters the box. He takes a couple of touches before powering his way past Struijk and swivelling an unstoppable drive into the bottom left! His Arsenal career is go! 47 min: Saka dribbles his way past Gudmundsson down the right but overhits his cross. Calafiori tries unsuccessfully to keep the move going on the left flank. 46 min: Arsenal are immediately on the front foot, their press forcing Tanaka into conceding a throw deep in Leeds territory. Calafiori launches a long one into the mixer but the visitors clear their lines easily enough. Arsenal get the second half started. No changes. Half-time entertainment. Crystal Palace bid farewell to their FA Cup final hero. Arsenal have had two attempts on target. Two goals. The sort of clinical behaviour that wins titles. 45 min +3: That’ll have cheered Mikel Arteta’s mood. Saka sprinkling some necessary stardust on an otherwise middling performance. Out of nowhere, an absolute belter! Rice steals the ball off Gruev, 30 yards from the Leeds goal, and feeds Timber, who slips Saka into the box down the inside-right. Saka’s got Gyokeres in the middle, waiting for a tap-in, but instead goes for goal himself, roofing a fierce shot across Perri from a tight angle! The keeper, ostensibly covering his near post, had no chance, such was the ferocity of the shot. Wow! 45 min: There will be three additional first-half minutes. 43 min: Arsenal may be leading, but their manager isn’t happy. He’s throwing a lot of semaphore shapes in his technical area, and telling his players what’s what. 41 min: Nope, and when the ball’s hoofed clear, Madueke gets the better of Stach in a footrace down the inside-left channel before hammering a shot goalwards. Perri parries, then the whistle goes for a generous free kick to Leeds, Madueke having gently put a hand on his opponent’s shoulder. Stach got away with some timid play there. 40 min: Bogle barges his way down the right flank. He has his foot trodden on by Calafiori, who is fortunate not to go into the book. But it’s a free kick, and a chance for Leeds to line up on the edge of the Arsenal box. Can they hoist the hosts by their own set-piece petard? 38 min: Odegaard can’t continue. He makes way for Nwaneri and trudges off looking glum. 37 min: Madueke crosses from the left. Rodon half clears. Zubimendi meets the dropping ball and volleys it towards Holloway Road. 36 min: That goal came at a good time for Arsenal, with their fans getting a little agitated as the team ran out of ideas in open play. Now they’re in full voice: 1-0 to the Arsenal, as the old classic goes. Rice sends a fierce in-swinger into a crowded six-yard box. Timber meets it, glancing the ball across Perri and into the right-hand side of the net. Simple as that! It’s not breaking news, but they’re damn good at corners. 33 min: Calafiori wins a corner down the left. Time for one of Arsenal’s famous set-pieces. And … 32 min: Odegaard has the chance to play in Zubimendi down the right, but turns tail and sends the ball back to his defenders. Soon enough the ball’s at Raya’s feet. A few grumbles from the home fans, who may be wondering what happened to that fast start. 30 min: Calafiori has the chance to release Madueke down the left but overcooks the pass, the ball sent carelessly out for a goal kick. On the touchline, Mikel Arteta frowns quite a lot, and he’s not the only one. “This is all a bit tame from Arsenal,” writes Charles Antaki. “Perhaps the players have been up all night reading about the new team-mate. A bit of fizz required.” 29 min: … and so he comes back on. But he doesn’t look totally happy. 28 min: Odegaard’s feeling that right shoulder. It looks like he’s walking off, but then gives Mikel Arteta the thumbs-up. He wants to continue. 27 min: Odegaard sits down on the pitch and asks for the physio, who comes on and checks that shoulder. 26 min: Now it’s Leeds’ turn to stroke it around slowly. They’ll be happy with the way this match has panned out so far. 24 min: Arsenal’s early energy has dropped a little, and Leeds look slightly more comfortable as a result. Meanwhile Russell Yong’s first reaction to seeing the news of Eze’s signing break just before kick-off was: “What, no on-pitch contract signing a la Bryan Robson in 1981?! Men in suits crowded around a tiny table, fold-out chairs, some awkward ball-juggling in a suit and tie afterward? Game’s gone!” 22 min: Leeds have come alive. James advances down the right and reaches the byline, looking to find Gnonto at the near post. Gnonto can’t force the ball past Raya, who spreads himself bravely to block and takes a whack for his trouble. He’s up and about soon enough, able to restart the game with a goal kick. 20 min: … Struijk wins a header on the penalty spot and powers it straight at Raya, who tips over with a strong hand. Either side of the keeper and that was surely a goal. Nothing comes of the second corner. 19 min: … and so having said that, Leeds bust out of their half. James again runs at Calafiori down the right, and this time his low shot deflects out for a corner. From which … 18 min: Madueke slips forward for Gyokeres down the inside-left channel, but the pass is all wrong and Bogle can intercept and clear. Leeds are struggling to get out of their half. 16 min: From the restart, Leeds play themselves into trouble, Perri and Struijk faffing around with some unnecessary short passes. Zubimendi spots what’s unfolding, latching onto Struijk’s attempt to play upfield for Stach, and toe-pokes to Gyokeres, free on the penalty spot. Gyokeres has more time than he realises, and on the swivel, swipes a first-time shot wide left. Arsenal should be leading. 15 min: Rice takes the resulting free kick, sending a diagonal ball towards Gabriel on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Gabriel’s header sails harmlessly wide right. 14 min: Odegaard spins Stach, who barges him over from behind. The Arsenal captain lands awkwardly on his shoulder, and stays down grimacing awhile, but thankfully gets back up soon enough. 12 min: … and now they go long, but Gabriel is too strong for Piroe in the chase down the middle. He shepherds the ball back to Raya. 11 min: Leeds finally show in attack, James cutting in from the right and battering a low shot that’s blocked by Calafiori. 10 min: Arsenal waste another free kick, Odegaard witlessly hoofing it into a crowded box. But the hosts come again. First Calafiori flops over near James, and cheekily claims a penalty. He doesn’t get it. Rice then crosses from the left, but Saka can’t meet it with his head. Leeds finally clear their lines. 9 min: Perri dallies with the ball at his feet and is hounded by Gyokeres, forcing a shanked clearance. Bogle keeps it in play with a header on the touchline, but Madueke races off with it. Bogle responds by clipping Madueke from behind, just outside the box. He goes into the book, and will have a long evening ahead of him. 8 min: Saka busies himself down the right and cuts back for Odegaard, who drags a shot wide right from the edge of the box. Perri had it covered. 7 min: Gudmundsson clumsily clanks into Zubimendi. Free kick to Arsenal, just to the right of the D. A chance to stick one into the box, but they opt to play it short and waste it. 5 min: Leeds haven’t had much of a sniff yet. 4 min: James stands on the ball in the centre circle, allowing Rice to steam off with it. Rice lays off to Odegaard, who tries a drive from distance. That’s blocked as well. Arsenal have started briskly. 3 min: Calafiori feeds Madueke down the left wing and keeps going. He gets the ball back as he enters the box on the overlap, but his cross, intended for Gyokeres in the middle, is no good. Blocked and cleared. But it’s a promising start by Madueke, who is stationed on his less-favoured flank. 2 min: Timber finds Madueke on the left with a raking crossfield pass. Madueke sends in a cross-cum-shot that’s easy pickings for Perri in the Leeds goal. Leeds get the ball rolling. Arsenal soon take it off them. … and now the players ready for tonight emerge. Arsenal in their traditional red and white, Leeds in second-choice blue. A genuine buzz in the stadium, a heady mix of first-home-fixture-of-the-season excitement and new-signing thrill. We’ll be off soon, but just before kick-off, there’s a moment of applause in memory of former Arsenal director and board member Richard Carr, who died recently. Ebere Eze, Arsenal’s new number 10, casually saunters out of the tunnel with his new shirt on. A broad smile then a laugh as he soaks up the love. Quite the ovation. He’s signed too late to feature this evening, but he’ll be available for Arsenal’s trip to Anfield next weekend. Daniel Farke talks to Sky Sports. “No doubt we are playing one of the best sides … maybe the best side in terms of consistency … we know there will be difficult parts of the game … we must be rock-solid … suffer together … but it won’t be enough to just defend for 90-plus minutes … it’s also important that we have periods when we control the ball … play our game … we stick to our DNA … physicality … good in both boxes … still play football.” Some breaking news coming out of the Emirates: Arsenal have just completed the signing of Crystal Palace and England winger Eberechi Eze on a long-term contract. “We are absolutely delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal,” says Mikel Arteta. “He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game. “What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today. His journey, his mentality, and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team.” Eberechi will be given the number 10 shirt. He will meet his new team-mates after tonight’s game. Mikel Arteta speaks to Sky Sports. “We have options … every game we will look at potential advantages we could have … we have resources throughout the game to change things … [15-year-old Max Dowman] has earned the right to be on the bench … you see already the enthusiasm and joy of the fans … we have the chance to create something very important.” Street art seems to be the order of the day on the bustling avenues that surround the Emirates Stadium. Here we see fans flocking to study minimalist satire Trophy Cabinet (2025, paint on brick). The controversial painting hangs in a location previously reserved for All Roads Lead Home, a Bansky-style mural depicting Eberechi Eze. Meanwhile, stationed outside a nearby pizzeria, this typographical piece contemplates themes of existential angst and unrequited desire. Do you want some chilli oil with your crude sloganeering? Arsenal make two changes to their starting XI after the 1-0 win at Manchester United. Jurriën Timber replaces the injured Ben White in defence, while Noni Madueke comes in for the benched Gabriel Martinelli. Leeds United also won their opening game 1-0, at home to Everton last Monday. They make one change to their starting line-up, Ilia Gruev replacing their injured captain Ethan Ampadu. Arsenal: Raya, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori, Odegaard, Zubimendi, Rice, Saka, Gyokeres, Madueke. Subs: Mosquera, Arrizabalaga, Kiwior, Trossard, Nwaneri, Merino, Lewis-Skelly, Dowman, Martinelli. Leeds United: Lucas Perri, Bogle, Rodon, Struijk, Gudmundsson, Tanaka, Gruev, Stach, James, Piroe, Gnonto. Subs: Darlow, Longstaff, Aaronson, Nmecha, Bijol, Okafor, Harrison, Bornauw, Byram. Referee: Jarred Gillett (Australia). Welcome to a rematch of the 1972 FA Cup final, which Leeds United won 1-0 thanks to a goal from Sniffer Clarke. Leeds fans are advised to keep thinking about that, because more up-to-date data very much does not skew in their favour. In the last 20 years, these two clubs have met 11 times. Arsenal have won nine of the matches, scoring four goals on three separate occasions and 23 overall. Leeds have won none, scoring just seven goals in total. Pull the focus back just one more year, to the 2003-04 season, and we find another three wins for Arsenal: two 4-1s and a 5-0. So throw in Arsenal’s genuine title hopes and newly promoted Leeds’ more modest aims, and everything points to a home banker. But football is football, so you just never know. Kick-off is at 5.30pm UK time. It’s on!
