  When I was a teenager in the 1980s, I had a lot of favourite items of
  clothing: scrunchy turquoise cargo trousers with an elasticated waistband,
  grey suede pixie boots, a skimpy beach T-shirt with the word “Hawaii” written
  on it (a place I have never visited), a Cyndi Lauper-inspired ra-ra skirt with
  ruffles in pink, white and, yes, turquoise. But there were so many objects of
  desire that I was not permitted to acquire: crinkle-effect stilettos, a
  Frankie Say Relax T-shirt, jelly shoes, drainpipe jeans, a matador hat like
  the ones Mel &amp; Kim wore … Also out of my reach for most of my teens was
  the thing I wanted most: the effect of a whole outfit. A look. Until this one
  night. I was about to turn 17 and this was my outfit for the school dance. It
  was all sourced from my grandma’s wardrobe, except for the sunglasses, which
  were my mum’s. The outfit consisted of pieces that no one else would – or
  indeed should – put together: a pink sparkly minidress with a silver-sequined
  hem and collar, silver sparkly elbow-length gloves, square-toed gold vintage
  shoes and a fake fur leopard-print coat which was not to be removed, even
  indoors. The coat was an essential part of the outfit, (a) for modesty
  reasons, as the dress was a bit see-through and (b) because I did not have
  maximum body confidence at this or, it would transpire, any other time. My
  hair was styled with my mum’s heated rollers and assiduously coated with
  L’Oréal Studio Line hairspray. This was in early summer 1990, the era of
  gatecrasher balls (riotous parties for posh teenagers) and the heyday of Laura
  Ashley (purveyor of black velvet off-the-shoulder ballgowns). I wanted to wear
  something that signalled that I was definitely not part of either of these
  phenomena, that I was my own person. So I aimed for a look that channelled
  Debbie Harry, Madonna, Wendy James from Transvision Vamp, Jackie Kennedy and
  Marilyn Monroe all at the same time, a combination which, to me, represented
  the height of iconographic originality. D’oh. The dress was once full-length.
  My grandma was an excellent seamstress and made it herself in the 1960s. I’m
  not sure how I persuaded her to chop it up into a minidress for me. The gloves
  and shoes she had from dances and parties in the 60s and 70s, when she and my
  grandad were amateur ballroom dancing champions. My mum and my grandma were
  sceptical about this outfit and wished that I would borrow a Laura Ashley
  dress. But I think they were won over in the end by the overall look.
  Crucially, I achieved my ultimate goal of not being dressed anything like
  anyone else at the dance. It did take some negotiation to get my grandma to
  throw in the coveted “Bet Lynch coat” as a finishing touch. I didn’t want to
  wreck it by sweating on it, so when the DJ played Transvision Vamp’s Baby I
  Don’t Care, I vogued with elegant caution. This outfit is still and will
  always be the greatest outfit I have ever worn.
