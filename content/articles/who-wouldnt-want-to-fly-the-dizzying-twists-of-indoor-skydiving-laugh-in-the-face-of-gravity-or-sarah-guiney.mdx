  Given the name, you would think that the sky is an integral part of the
  skydiving experience. The most integral, in fact. Yet tucked away in iFly
  facilities around the globe, hurtling through imperiously large wind tunnels,
  indoor skydivers might just disagree on a technicality. The tunnels offer a
  prolonged simulation of skydiving’s freefall in 200km/h wind. The results, a
  spectacle to behold, with acrobatic flips and dizzying turns that seem to
  laugh in the face of gravity. They haven’t removed the sky, exactly. They’ve
  simply bottled it. Kyra Poh, a competitor in this weekend’s Australian indoor
  skydiving championships, knows this equation all too well. “Indoors is like:
  unlimited time, limited space,” Poh says. “In the sky, we have unlimited
  space, but limited time.” The 23-year-old from Singapore is a Red Bull athlete
  and current indoor skydiving world champion, but her background – perhaps
  surprisingly – is in competitive swimming. Her first taste of “flying” came 15
  years ago, when her mother’s advertising agency was engaged by iFly Singapore
  to showcase younger flyers in a commercial. Eight-year-old Poh was the perfect
  choice. “I loved rollercoasters, anything that has adrenaline and speed, so
  when my mum asked me to become a flyer, it was a no-brainer,” Poh says.
  “Swimming was doing the same four strokes over and over every single day, so
  this was really refreshing. The possibilities were basically endless.” These
  possibilities are explored in the competitive side of the sport – a bustling
  combination of national contests and world championships, stretching across
  multiple disciplines and divided by skill level and number of flyers. The
  disciplines can be split into two main categories: dynamic and speed, and
  freestyle. Freestyle is where indoor skydiving’s artistry really comes to
  life. It boasts meticulously choreographed and synchronised routines, all
  imbued with breathtaking creativity and set to music. “We take inspiration
  from many sports,” Poh says. “Street dancing or breakdancing, ballet,
  gymnastics … but with the element of wind, so we can do it all when we’re
  floating. It’s kind of like ice-skating but three-dimensional.” As with all
  sports that marry grace with athleticism, the elegance on display disguises
  the significant load being placed upon the body. For Poh, flight training
  looks like 90-second reps in 15-minute bursts, with 30-minute recovery
  periods, for up to seven hours a day. When she trains for world championship
  meets, she is at the facility six or seven days a week for four months.
  Conditioning reflects this accordingly. “We have to do a lot of strengthening
  and stretching outside of the tunnel,” Poh says. “For a freestyle routine,
  we’re putting our bodies through one minute and 30 seconds of extreme spins,
  so we do a lot of warmups. And because we don’t have any impact with the
  ground, we’re using a bunch of our muscles that we would never use if we
  weren’t flying.” For Canberra-based skydiver Jakob Kapelj it’s all about
  shoulder training. “I do a lot of head-down positions in the tunnel. It’s much
  more physically demanding on your body than actual skydiving.” An avid outdoor
  skydiver, Kapelj started out while living in Florida a decade ago, where he
  completed 50 jumps: “not a lot” by skydiving standards. Pursuing the indoor
  side began much more recently. “I was travelling a lot for work and we had a
  long layover down in Melbourne,” he says. “I thought that rather than sitting
  in the airport, eating crappy food and drinking beers, I’d go find something
  more productive to do.” A Google search and a quick taxi ride took Kapelj to
  the nearby iFly, where he “did a few sessions, had so much fun, and basically
  became obsessed”. Undeterred by the closest tunnel being in Penrith, he began
  making frequent trips north and progressing through skills development at an
  eye-watering pace. A mere two-and-a-half years later, and Kapelj will compete
  in these championships as his first official competition. He won’t be alone
  when he does – his daughter Alia, 7, will also be making her debut in the
  junior contest. “The kids have so much fun,” Kapelj says. “They get creative,
  and they’re just playing in this really fun environment.” The sport itself can
  be quite an expensive pursuit, especially with the tunnel time required to
  compete at a high level. But with how quickly you can begin to master tricks,
  Kapelj believes it’s well worth the investment. “Have a go, and you’ll be
  surprised by how quickly you can be let off the grip with your instructor. And
  then once you’re flying all on your own, it’s so much fun.” Poh’s pitch is
  even more simple: “Who wouldn’t want to fly?”
