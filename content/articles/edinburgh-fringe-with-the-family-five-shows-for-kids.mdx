  Whale, Where Are You Going? Assembly Rooms, 10.10am, until 24 August The old
  man who sits at the centre of this imaginative blend of object theatre and
  shadow puppetry from Taiwan’s S Production is the cantankerous sort, tied to
  his routine and resistant to change. His day is an uneventful parade of tasks:
  teeth brushing, newspaper reading and failing to put his socks on. It is much
  to his surprise that he wakes to find the room tidy and his secret box of
  memories moved. And it is much to his consternation that a boy appears from
  another box, unruly, undomesticated and curious. It is that very curiosity
  that unlocks the old man’s backstory and rejuvenates him. Inside the secret
  box, the boy finds evidence of a perilous biplane crash over wartime seas and
  a drowning pilot rescued by a whale. By my reckoning that would make the old
  man about 125 years old, which would also account for the old-fashioned Boy’s
  Own Adventure focus of the show. It is easy to put that aside, however, when
  mischievous humour and visual inventiveness abounds, whether it is paper
  planes floating overhead, deathly waves inundating the stage or the enormous
  blue whale swelling to the full height of the walls around us. toooB Pleasance
  Courtyard, 10am and 11am, until 25 August I usually take the post-show play
  session as my cue to leave, but this one is delightful. We have just watched
  Tamsin Fessey perform a hypnotic dance, aimed at 6-24-month-olds, from inside
  a colourful tube. Hidden within, she rolls and stretches, giving life to this
  wriggly creature and making a face of the orange hoop at one end. Tuning in to
  the priorities of the young audience, she is variously shy, inquisitive,
  hungry and sick. She dances when the music demands it and sighs when it stops.
  She plays games with the springy containers around her and discovers enticing
  silvery balls inside. This toooB seems to have a life of her own until, slowly
  in this wordless production by Angel Exit, attractively designed by Verity
  Quinn, we spot the performer within: a foot, a hand, a cautious eye. And with
  her emergence, it is time for the audience to join in: new balls and tubes
  appearing around us to create an infant adventure playground, full of tactile
  wonder. You’ll See … Pleasance Courtyard, 12pm, until 24 August It sounds like
  a joke. Take a famously impenetrable classic of world literature, a
  stream-of-consciousness Dublin odyssey stretching to 250,000 words, and turn
  it into a show for the over-eights. But Helen Gregg is for real and her
  adaptation of James Joyce’s Ulysses is a joy. Introducing a book that few of
  the adults in the audience will have read, she strips it down to its narrative
  framework, judiciously editing for family viewing, and turns it into 45
  minutes of day-in-the-life storytelling. Leafing through enormous pop-up books
  – three of them, just like the sections of the original – she traces the
  comings and goings of a cut-out Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedalus, flanked by
  a city’s worth of quirky characters, from funeral to office to pub. In Marc
  Mac Lochlainn’s production for Galway company Branar, it is performed with wit
  and lucidity, not to mention musical interludes. Gregg is a brilliant
  interpreter and makes an imposing novel sound like a fun thing to tackle at
  home. Hello Birds Assembly George Square, 11.30am, until 17 August Hard to
  imagine a more gentle introduction to theatre than this sensory performance
  for babies, written by Jasmine Cole and directed by Connie Crosby. Narrated by
  Hannah Platts and performed on a large floorcloth over which the audience can
  roam, it is set in a garden where the leaves are tactile, the mushrooms rattle
  and the pond is made of silver foil. A bee buzzes by as the children
  acclimatise, then it is time for the big reveal: a sequence of cloth puppet
  birds, manipulated by Jennie Rawling, introduced with birdsong and welcomed
  with a pretty human song. Things get no more dramatic than when the starling
  imitates a cow and a tractor and, as the lights dim, a night owl soars
  overhead with stars shining through its wings. The stakes might be low, but is
  pitched perfectly at a mesmerised audience. The Unlikely Friendship of Feather
  Boy and Tentacle Girl Assembly Roxy, 11.25am, until 17 August Feather Boy and
  Tentacle Girl are opposites. One lives in the city; one in the country. One is
  rough; the other smooth. One sunny; one sour. But although theirs is a
  relationship of contradictions, they find a way to connect. They do this
  through the mutual dependency of acrobatics, balancing high above the stage,
  moving in careful synchronisation. In this aerial show for the over-eights by
  circus artists Vee Smith and Sadiq Ali working with Catherine Wheels theatre
  company, it is as if the two have been let loose in an outsize play park,
  mocking gravity as they hang upside down, spin precariously or plummet to the
  ocean depths. Narratively light and open to interpretation, it reaches a
  climax with a spectacular storm of red and white feathers on Jen McGinley’s
  set, swirling in windy chaos.
