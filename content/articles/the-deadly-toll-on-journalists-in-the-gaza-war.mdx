  Over the past 22 months, the war in Gaza has become the most deadly conflict
  for journalists in history. Last week, five Palestinian journalists – Hussam
  al-Masri, Mariam Abu Dagga, Mohammed Salama, Ahmed Abu Aziz and Moaz Abu Taha
  – were killed in a double strike on Nasser hospital by the Israeli military,
  bringing the total number of journalists and media workers killed in this
  conflict since October 2023 to at least 189, according to the Committee to
  Protect Journalists (CPJ). Other groups put the tally far higher. Just one
  week before, another four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelancers were
  killed by a targeted Israeli strike on their tent outside al-Shifa hospital in
  Gaza City. The Israeli military said it deliberately targeted the Al Jazeera
  crew – the correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who had reported on the war since its
  outset, the reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, the cameraman Ibrahim Zaher, and
  Mohammed Noufal, a crew driver and cameraman. The CPJ and other organisations
  say that this claim is part of a pattern of misinformation – along with other
  cases where slain journalists have been labelled as Hamas fighters or
  operatives – and is without credibility. The Israeli military has prevented
  international journalists from entering and reporting on the war, and has
  decimated Gaza’s own media community. Under international law, journalists
  should be protected civilians, yet the CPJ says that Israel is “engaging in
  the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that
  CPJ has ever documented”. “Palestinian journalists are being threatened,
  directly targeted and murdered by Israeli forces, and are arbitrarily detained
  and tortured in retaliation for their work. By silencing the press – those who
  document and bear witness – Israel is silencing the war,” the organisation
  said. Despite growing global condemnation and concerns over breaches of
  international law, Israel is continuing its military assault on Gaza and it is
  likely that more journalists will die as a result. The Guardian is printing
  the names of all the Palestinian journalists listed by the CPJ as having died
  as a result of Israeli military action since October 2023 as part of a day of
  action in condemnation of the killings and in solidarity with those
  journalists who remain, reporting on the war in Gaza. The names on this list
  not only constitute lost lives, futures and grieving families, but the loss of
  a generation of journalists killed doing their jobs in the most frightening
  and devastating of environments and whose bravery and dedication to covering
  this conflict cannot be replaced. This list will continue to be updated as
  more deaths occur. The CPJ list stands at 189. The Gaza Media Center and other
  Palestinian media groups put the numbers higher, at 238; the UN human rights
  office puts the figure at 247. Ahmed Abu Aziz Journalist 25/8/25 Nasser
