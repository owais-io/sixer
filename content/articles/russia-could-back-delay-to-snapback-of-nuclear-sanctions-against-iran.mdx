  Russia and Iran could back an extended six-month deadline before European
  powers reimpose sweeping United Nations sanctions on Iran over its refusal to
  allow UN inspectors back into nuclear sites after the Israeli-US assault in
  June. France, Britain and Germany – known as the E3 – have long threatened to
  trigger a “snapback” of sanctions at the UN security council before 18
  October, when a largely defunct nuclear deal struck 10 years ago between
  Tehran and major powers expires. Senior officials from Iran and Europe’s top
  three powers are due to meet in Geneva on Tuesday to discuss the western
  demand. Western officials have said they would wait until the end of August to
  decide whether Iran was serious about further negotiations, with a six-month
  extension only on the condition that Iran showed seriousness about the talks
  with the US. “We are going to see whether the Iranians are credible about an
  extension or whether they are messing us around. We want to see whether they
  have made any progress on the conditions we set to extend,” one E3 official
  said. Russia and China – two of the security council’s five permanent members
  – cannot veto the snapback if Europe decides to take the step. The Iranian
  president, Masoud Pezeshkian, spoke with Vladimir Putin over the weekend and
  there were tentative reports that Russia was willing to back the six-month
  extension with the possible approval of the US. A Russian draft resolution
  making the six-month deadline extendable is already being circulated at the UN
  headquarters in New York. Europe has been largely excluded from the five
  rounds of US-Iranian bilateral talks that Trump started, which came to an
  abrupt halt when Israel began what became a 12-day assault on Iran’s nuclear
  sites. The snapback mechanism is the only way back into the talks process for
  European powers that were central to the original nuclear deal, but have found
  themselves increasingly edged out of the diplomacy. The European conditions
  include the resumption of inspections, the accounting for Iran’s large stock
  of highly enriched uranium, and resuming diplomatic talks with the US. The
  Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, this week ruled out direct
  talks with Washington, a formula that, however, keeps open the possibility of
  talks with a mediator, either from Oman or Norway. The E3 have threatened to
  trigger the snapback by the end of August, a move that would minimise the risk
  of Russian obstruction, since Moscow will assume the month-long presidency of
  the UN security council in September. A counter draft resolution put forward
  by Russia reportedly entails an extension of the deadline so that “snapback”
  cannot be triggered for at least six months. That six-month period would be
  extendable under the Russian proposal. The true state of Iran’s nuclear
  programme is not known, although Donald Trump says it has been obliterated.
  The White House sacked the Pentagon defence official who produced a more
  nuanced assessment. Iran admits it had been enriching uranium to up to 60%
  purity, a short step from the roughly 90% of weapons-grade, as a reprisal for
  the US leaving the nuclear deal in 2018. Iran insists it had no intention of
  making a nuclear bomb. Iran has severely criticised the International Atomic
  Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN body, for, in Tehran’s view, giving credence to US
  claims that Iran may be hiding a secret military nuclear programme. But the
  IAEA said while it could not guarantee Tehran’s nuclear programme was entirely
  peaceful, it had no credible details of a coordinated weapons programme in
  Iran. The IAEA has reopened talks with Iranian officials on the terms for the
  resumption of inspections, and the talks in Geneva will have a strong focus on
  whether Iran is prepared to meet its duties under the nuclear
  non-proliferation treaty to resume inspections. Iran claims that the damage to
  its nuclear site requires a new plan with the agency, and this will be more
  restrictive.
