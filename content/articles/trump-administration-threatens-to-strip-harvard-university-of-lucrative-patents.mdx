  The latest phase of the Trump administration’s offensive against Harvard
  University is a comprehensive review of the university’s federally funded
  research programs, and the threat to strip the school’s lucrative portfolio of
  patents. In a letter to the Harvard president, Alan Garber, posted online on
  Friday, Donald Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, accused Harvard of
  breaching its legal and contractual requirements tied to federally funded
  research programs and patents. Lutnick also said the commerce department had
  begun a “march-in” process under the federal Bayh-Dole Act that could let the
  government take ownership of the patents or grant licenses. “The Department
  places immense value on the groundbreaking scientific and technological
  advancements that emerge from the Government’s partnerships with institutions
  like Harvard,” Lutnick wrote. He said that carried a “critical responsibility”
  for Harvard to ensure that its intellectual property derived from federal
  funding is used to maximize benefits to the American people. Harvard did not
  immediately respond to requests for comment. Friday’s letter ratchets up White
  House pressure on Harvard, which it has accused of civil rights violations for
  failing to take steps dictated by the administration in response to
  accusations that student protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza were
  antisemitic. Harvard sued in April after the administration began stripping or
  freezing billions of dollars of federal research money. In his letter, Lutnick
  demanded that Harvard provide within four weeks a list of all patents stemming
  from federally funded research grants, including how the patents are used and
  whether any licensing requires “substantial US manufacturing”. As of 1 July
  2024, Harvard held more than 5,800 patents, and had more than 900 technology
  licenses with over 650 industry partners, according to the Harvard Office of
  Technology Development. Other universities faced with federal research funding
  losses have signed settlement agreements with the government, including
  Columbia University, which agreed to pay more than $220m, and Brown
  University, which agreed to pay $50m. Harvard’s president reportedly told
  faculty that a New York Times report that the university was open to spending
  up to $500m to settle with the government was inaccurate and had been leaked
  to reporters by White House officials. The bipartisan Bayh-Dole Act was
  sponsored by Senators Birch Bayh of Indiana and Bob Dole of Kansas and signed
  into law by Jimmy Carter near the end of his term. Carter said at the time it
  was important that industrial innovation promote US economic health, and the
  legislation “goes far toward strengthening the effectiveness of the patent
  incentive in stimulating innovation in the United States”. Many civil rights
  experts, faculty and White House critics believe the Trump administration’s
  targeting of schools for supposedly failing to address antisemitism is a
  pretext to assert federal control and threaten academic freedom and free
  speech.
