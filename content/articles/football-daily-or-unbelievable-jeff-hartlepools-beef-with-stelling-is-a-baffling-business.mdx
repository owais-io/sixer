  JEFF’S COMING, YO! You come at the Stelling you’d best not miss, as the famous
  quote from The Wire’s Omar Little kind of goes. Feared by his enemies and
  loved by viewers, the scar-faced stick-up man’s advice suggests that anyone
  attempting to challenge the established order should be prepared for
  unpleasant consequences if their plan backfires. It is a lesson Hartlepool
  United owner Raj Singh is currently learning the hard way after sending a
  letter to each of Hartlepool’s fellow National League clubs asking them to ban
  Jeff Stelling – the TalkSport and former Soccer Saturday host, and national
  treasure – from their boardrooms and hospitality suites for the season ahead.
  In scenes that his chum Chris Kamara would almost certainly describe as
  “Unbelievable, Jeff!” (unless they in some way involved an Anthony Vanden
  Borre red card at Fratton Park), Stelling resigned from his role as president
  of Hartlepool in May, in protest at Singh’s handling of negotiations over the
  protracted non-sale of his beloved hometown club. Apparently still fuming over
  Stelling’s decision to step down from an honorary role in which he wielded the
  same amount of power as your average regimental goat, Singh recently embarked
  on a letter-writing campaign to call upon his fellow owners to deny Stelling
  any of the myriad lavish trappings of hospitality associated with
  cash-strapped non-league clubs when he travels to Hartlepool away games.
  Having initially made it clear that Jeff was not to be considered for any
  freebies specifically designated for club officials, Singh added: “In the
  unlikely event that Mr Stelling independently attends any Hartlepool fixture
  at your home ground, I’d further request that you consider to seat Mr Stelling
  separately to any HUFC dignitaries or staff.” And while nobody is denying
  Hartlepool has its dignitaries, it seems actual dignity is currently at a
  premium in their corridors of power. Football Daily doesn’t claim to be
  familiar with the nitty-gritty of the beef, but what we can say for sure is
  that we hope Stelling has another one of his charity walks teed up, so that
  he’ll be able to march off the excess blubber he’s certain to put on after
  National League clubs the length and breadth of the country fall over each
  other to defy what looks like a petty and sly act of vindictiveness. In
  calling for Stelling to be denied hospitality, Hartlepool’s owner has almost
  certainly guaranteed that the universally popular broadcaster will be
  subjected to the kind of extreme levels of corporate largesse unlikely to be
  witnessed in the fifth tier ever again unless Manchester City end up playing
  in it after the verdict on those 100-plus charges is finally announced. “I’m a
  lifelong supporter of that football club and if it came down to the fact that
  I travelled and stood with the Poolies, the Hartlepool supporters, wherever
  they are, then that’s fine,” a slightly baffled Jeff told his radio audience.
  “I’d already bought my ticket – we’re away to Yeovil on Saturday – to be with
  the fans, so I didn’t get the issue or why Mr Singh wanted to raise it. The
  other thing that I took offence to was in the statement he says in the
  unlikely event that I attend games independently. Well, I mean, last season I
  went to Aldershot, Eastleigh, Solihull, Southend, Sutton, Wealdstone, Woking,
  Dagenham and Redbridge, Ebbsfleet, Maidenhead and a few others as well, so,
  it’s not so unlikely that I’ll attend. I’ll be at Yeovil on Saturday and I’ll
  tell you what, I’ll say it right now – if Mr Singh is there, I’ll be happy to
  meet him and have a chat with him.” Meet him? If the Yeovil Town hierarchy
  have anything at all about them, Jeff will be sitting right beside the man he
  says he hasn’t seen in at least a year. It certainly sounds like it’s time for
  either a long overdue catch-up or 90 minutes of awkward silence. QUOTE OF THE
  DAY I’ve done one live performance which felt a bit weird – there was a live
  band playing the drums and I had to literally use it as an instrument, which
  felt crazy, but I enjoyed it. It’s all about timing …” – Fulham’s Alex Iwobi
  gets his chat on with Ed Aarons about how he enjoys dabbling with being a
  musician as a chance to breathe away from football, but is still 100%
  committed to the game. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS I know Mr Francis has dumped all
  of your sisters but not giving him letter o’ the day for the nominative
  determinism belter (yesterday’s Football Daily) was just petty. Noble rot!” –
  Harry Piano. Marvellous contribution, as always, from Noble Francis. I found
  his comments on nominative determinism doubly fascinating, as I’d always
  assumed his name was Francis, with Noble being an epithet, as in Teflon Tony
  or Stinky Pete. You really do learn something every day. (And yes, I’m fully
  aware that I don’t actually have to explain to Big Website readers what an
  epithet is …)” – Phil Taverner. It was very sad to hear of Jorge Costa passing
  away, and at only 53 years old too. That’s no age at all. Unsurprisingly, all
  the focus will rightly be on his eight league titles, five cups, Uefa Cup and
  Champions League but for some of us elder members of this parish, he will
  always be a key part of the best named back four in what was called, at the
  time, the Barclaycard Premiership: ‘Young, Fish, Costa, Fortune’. RIP Jorge
  Costa” – Noble Francis. Many thanks for showing a beautiful photo of the
  Øresund/Öresund Bridge (yesterday’s Still Wants More, full email edition) when
  marking the occasion of the Øresund/Öresund Strait Bigger Cup clash. I was one
  of 40,000 runners to make the journey to Malmö on foot in May this year, and
  may even be on your chosen picture (although very close to the back). What an
  experience” – Iain Moore. Thanks for linking to the article about Noel Blake
  (yesterday’s Quote of the Day), and I wish him well. I can testify to the
  man’s footballing brilliance. At Exeter, December 1996, I once saw him nullify
  an entire Cardiff City attack by a tactic best summed up as: ‘He’s just
  chatting to Peter Fox in the centre circle, no hang on, he’s exactly in the
  right place to sort that out, and now he’s chatting to Peter again.’ The rest
  of the Exeter City defence were free to join in the rather random bombardment
  of the Cardiff end, which eventually, and rather painfully led to two goals.
  From my position amongst the Cardiff City Soul Crew (don’t ask) I can
  accurately report the Exeter goal was never threatened. I’ve never seen before
  or since, one defender, using such intelligence and pure class to boss a game.
  Mind you, I think Peter Fox nearly froze to death” – Jon Millard. If you have
  any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our
  letter o’ the day is … Jon Millard, who lands some Football Weekly merch.
