  reinstate life membership

  A co-founder of the Australian Greens is taking his former party to court in a
  bid to reinstate the life membership stripped from him about six weeks ago
  over what it considers his pursuit of debate harmful to trans people. Drew
  Hutton filed an affidavit in the Queensland supreme court on Tuesday arguing
  that he was denied natural justice and procedural fairness when the
  78-year-old retiree had his membership terminated by an assembly of branch
  delegates on 20 July. That decision harkened back to comments relating to
  trans issues that were made by others below Hutton’s social media posts in
  June 2022. The party’s disciplinary committee subsequently deemed he had
  provided a platform for transphobia by failing to remove these comments. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email Hutton, who also founded the Queensland Greens, has
  long argued he was pursuing free speech and a “respectful discussion and
  debate of the rights of trans people and others”. “As part of the whole
  suspension and expulsion process, there is a whole lot of skulduggery that has
  gone on – and I am very confident of winning this,” he told Guardian Australia
  on Wednesday. Queensland Greens convener Gemmia Burden said the party would
  closely examine the legal documents filed by Hutton’s legal team. Burden has
  consistently responded to questions on the subject by saying that the Greens’
  position, as endorsed by its membership, is that trans rights are
  non-negotiable human rights. Following Hutton’s expulsion she said that “no
  member” was above the need to treat others with respect. “It is disheartening
  to see that Mr Hutton has prioritised his perceived right to free speech over
  the safety of others,” Burden said at the time. The Australian Greens leader
  and senator for Queensland, Larissa Waters, declined to comment on Wednesday.
  While seeking to distance herself from the process of Hutton’s expulsion, she
  has previously backed the outcome of his failed internal appeal, saying it
  reflected “good governance” and sent the message that “nobody is above the
  rules”. But Hutton will argue that his internal appeal to the party against
  his expulsion was lost on “allegations and the presentation of information
  that were never conveyed to me”. Among the aspects of his claim to a denial of
  natural justice, Hutton will allege he never received a copy of the initial
  complaint made against him and was never told of its contents. Further, he
  said he was never told who made the initial complaint against him and was
  never offered an opportunity to seek to resolve the matter with them. He will
  also argue that the obligation to delete all comments on his thread that might
  be deemed offensive or objectionable was “just simply not right in law and was
  not right according to the Greens’ own constitution”. Hutton will be
  represented by high-profile barristers Stephen Keim and Chris McGrath and
  expects a legal bill of at least $150,000. He will launch a crowdfunding
  campaign and seek to have legal costs paid by the Greens if his court action
  is successful. The former lecturer of politics and history said he has three
  objectives in taking the matter to court. “I want to get my membership back,”
  he said. “I want a public apology. And I want them to stop the expulsions, all
  around Australia.” Hutton has maintained he has been contacted by more than 40
  former Greens members kicked out of the party in recent years for alleged
  transphobia. A directions hearing is set for 13 October.
