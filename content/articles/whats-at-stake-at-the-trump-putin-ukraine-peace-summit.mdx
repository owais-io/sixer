  Few believe that Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska will pave the way for a
  breakthrough. Russia and Ukraine remain far apart – with the Kremlin seeking
  to dominate its smaller neighbour while Kyiv wants to move decisively into the
  western sphere. Here are some of the key issues that will need to be addressed
  to reach a meaningful peace settlement. Territory Russia occupies around a
  fifth of Ukraine after more than three years of fighting but continues to
  demand land. Earlier this week the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
  said Russia wanted the rest of Donetsk oblast, 9,000 square kilometres of
  territory, in return for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy said Ukraine could not agree,
  particularly for so little in return. Ukraine’s public would also be unlikely
  to accept handing over more land to the invader. Kyiv is willing to accept a
  ceasefire on the current frontlines, which would be followed by discussions
  about the future status of occupied territory. It is a particularly sensitive
  issue. Russia has sought formal recognition of at least some of the territory
  it has seized, most notably Crimea, but at best Ukraine is only likely to
  accept a de facto occupation. An alternative is that the status of occupied
  territories be parked for a future negotiation – “in 25 years time”, suggested
  John Foreman, a former British defence attache to Moscow. Security guarantees
  Russia says it wants Ukraine to be neutral, though in practice this means a
  weak neighbour with no ties to the west. In previous negotiations, still
  referenced by the Kremlin, it has demanded that Kyiv’s military be reduced to
  a token 50,000. It also still calls for the country to be “denazified”,
  interpreted as a call for the replacement of Zelenskyy. Ukraine would like to
  join Nato, though this has been rejected by the US, leaving it searching for
  bilateral or multilateral security guarantees from its western allies. Britain
  and France have promised to lead a predominantly European “reassurance force”
  that will enter Ukraine in the event of a stable ceasefire, though Russia is
  opposed to this. On Wednesday France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said Trump
  had said the US was also prepared to be part of security guarantees to prevent
  war breaking out again. It is unclear what Trump is prepared to offer though,
  and a Japan or South Korea style bilateral guarantee looks unlikely.
  Meanwhile, unless Russia is prepared to accept that Ukraine can determine its
  own security arrangements, agreed progress appears impossible. Sanctions and
  trade Russia wants economic sanctions that have been imposed on Moscow to be
  lifted. Trump, however, can only speak for the US, with the UK and the EU
  likely to be more hostile, unless Ukraine has signed up to an overall peace
  agreement. The Kremlin also wants to go further, and today Putin’s adviser,
  Yuri Ushakov, said the leaders would discuss wider cooperation, “including in
  the trade and economic sphere”, as part of a proposed arrangement between the
  two countries. Without tangible progress on other topics, a unilateral
  relaxation of sanctions by the US would be surprising. War crimes, reparations
  and reconstruction War crimes and claims for reparations cannot be set aside
  as part of a peace agreement. The international criminal court (ICC) has an
  arrest warrant out against Putin over the forced transfer of about 20,000
  children from Ukraine to Russia. Zelenskyy has asked that the youngsters are
  returned in the first stage of any peace discussions, but the ICC demand will
  not disappear. Ukraine “remains under an obligation to investigate war crimes
  and crimes against humanity against its own citizens”, says human rights
  lawyer Wayne Jordash from Global Rights Compliance. The World Bank estimated
  that the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine – where most of
  the war has been fought – amounts to €506bn (£435bn). After a resolution of
  the UN general assembly, a register for reparation claims has been set up by
  the Council of Europe to record eligible claims for compensation. However,
  Russia has so far refused to help fund reconstruction, leaving Ukraine to find
  alternative ways to fund its postwar rebuilding. An option is to seize Russian
  assets held abroad, amounting to around $280bn (£207bn), but achieving
  international consensus around seizure has been difficult. Other issues There
  are many other practical concerns. Ukraine is calling for the release of all
  prisoners of war alongside an initial ceasefire. Russia holds more than 8,000
  Ukrainian PoWs and Ukraine a smaller amount, making one-for-one swaps tricky.
  But there have been dozens of exchanges since the start of the war, and this
  may be one of the simpler issues to agree upon. Early in the war, Russia
  seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. Soon after
  it was shut down, but the site remains in Russian-held territory and there are
  signs that Russia wants to restart it and connect it to the country’s energy
  grid, a forced transfer that Ukraine will not recognise, but may be powerless
  to prevent. • This article was amended on 15 August 2025. Estimates for
  reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine amount to €506bn, which is £435bn, not
  £4.35bn as an earlier version said.
