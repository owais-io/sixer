  Manchester United are importing a sinister US tactic: Public money for
  stadiums

  In March, Manchester United officially unveiled images and plans for a new
  100,000-seater stadium to replace their aging home, Old Trafford. While the
  grandiosity of the circus-tent-like structure attracted widespread attention,
  something else did, too: as part of this project, United are planning to
  secure land not by paying for it themselves – but by having the UK government
  do it for them. In order to clear the site that the club wants to use, a rail
  freight hub will need to be moved to out near St Helens, between Manchester
  and Liverpool. The cost of moving the hub is estimated to be between £200m and
  300m ($270-405m), but that may be an optimistic appraisal; in the past, the
  project budget was estimated at closer to £1bn ($1.35bn). Politicians
  supporting United’s plan, like Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, have
  stressed that no public money will be used to build the stadium. But that
  appears to be a bit of verbal trickery: United’s new stadium cannot be built
  as planned without moving the freight rail hub; if the government pays to move
  the hub, they save United from having to do so themselves. (Manchester United
  declined to respond to a request for comment.) The plan’s proponents back it
  by promising it would confer grand economic benefits to Greater Manchester –
  92,000 new jobs! 17,000 new homes! 1.8 million additional tourists! – and
  would be worth over £7bn annually to the UK economy. Sebastian Coe, the chair
  of the Old Trafford Regeneration Taskforce and a key organizer behind the 2012
  London Olympics, has said “I don’t think I’m overstating when I say this
  actually has the potential to be, not only a bigger project than London 2012
  but, in terms of European scope and scale, probably the biggest thing that’s
  ever really been undertaken.” If United do secure hundreds of millions of
  pounds of public money as an ancillary part of the stadium project, the club,
  knowingly or otherwise, would be continuing a long and ignoble tradition that
  has become commonplace in America. In the UK, it’s relatively rare for big
  sports teams to benefit from public money. In the US, however, it’s such a
  common practice that the record for the largest public subsidy given to a team
  has been repeatedly shattered in recent years. The Las Vegas Raiders received
  $750m (£555m) in 2016. The Buffalo Bills got $850m (£629m) in 2022. The
  Washington Commanders are now in the process of landing over $1bn (£740m). And
  all that has happened despite a consensus among American academics that
  massive injections of public money towards major stadium projects have not led
  to the widespread economic benefits they promised. “That’s the story they tell
  to get the public money, but it’s the big lie” of the stadium funding debate,
  says Pat Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project, “We [in the US]
  export a lot of problematic things. And I really hope that we don’t export
  that big lie.” Adds Geoffrey Propheter, a professor at the University of
  Colorado-Denver: “In the US, my colleagues and I have the benefit of [decades]
  worth of examples. We have gotten to see how government intervention in sports
  facilities has evolved into this monster.” According to Propheter, out of the
  approximately 125 major league sports facilities across five major men’s
  leagues – MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLS – only about 10% do not or have not
  received public money in some form. In the UK, West Ham and Manchester City
  play in stadiums built with public money, but in both cases the facilities
  were built for one-off sporting events (the 2012 Olympics and the 2002
  Commonwealth Games, respectively) and then repurposed. According to research
  by the University of Michigan professor Stefan Szymanski, smaller clubs lower
  down the pyramid – such as Swansea City and Colchester United – have received
  some public money, but that spending was seen more as an investment into a
  community asset like a library or a school rather than as an economic
  generator. “In the US it is almost taken as a given now that any new facility
  will receive taxpayer funding,” says Garofalo. “It’s the ones that don’t that
  stand out as oddballs.” The story that Manchester United are telling now is
  the same one that American sports owners have told, again and again, despite a
  voluminous and still-growing body of proof that the story isn’t real. “I
  stress to my friends in the UK – all the evidence here shows that it’s not
  true,” Garofalo says. “You are setting this money on fire. And you are doing
  this to support a massive private business that prints money.” In 2024, the
  Portland Sea Dogs – a minor league baseball team in Maine – received a $2m tax
  break. While the sums of money and the size of the teams being discussed vary
  widely, there is a parallel between the Sea Dogs and Manchester United: both
  effectively disguised their solicitations for public money. Just as United
  aren’t asking for hundreds of millions of pounds to go into their stadium
  construction budget, the Sea Dogs didn’t ask for $2m to be put in their bank
  account. But by not having to pay $2m in taxes, that’s effectively what the
  Sea Dogs got. Maura Pillsbury of the Maine Center For Economic Policy was part
  of a network of locals and legislators who pushed back on the Sea Dogs’ tax
  break, ultimately unsuccessfully. When imagining what she would share with
  folks in Manchester as they contemplated United’s plan, she says, “Everybody
  here loves the Sea Dogs and I’m sure everybody there loves Manchester United”
  (City fans aside, of course) “so it’s hard to say no to. But I would encourage
  them to think about what they’re sacrificing. Other people are going to have
  to pay for that. Something is gonna get cut.” Donald Trump recently signed
  into law a massive federal budget bill that will slash social programs across
  the US and directly impact vulnerable populations in Maine. Meanwhile, the Sea
  Dogs recently unveiled the results of the renovation paid for in part by their
  tax break. “That was another dagger,” Pillsbury says. “Giving the Sea Dogs $2m
  – that was a policy choice. Where could have this money gone instead? That’s
  childcare subsidies, that’s healthcare, that’s food on kids’ plates. The
  emotional, feelgood nature of these proposals belie the actual reality –
  there’s a cost and a consequence to making these decisions.” Propheter says
  that to “get to where we are now” – where American pro teams have received
  billions in public money payouts – “it took about 50 years of these stadium
  messes. I wonder if across the pond, folks are like: ‘Hey, we can get to where
  America is because we can learn from the NFL, MLB – we can get to ballooning
  subsidies even faster.’” One thing standing in the way of this dangerous
  precedent blossoming in the UK may be the agency of the fans. As United seeks
  to benefit from public money, will fans – imagining where else their tax
  pounds could go – push back? American fans “live in a world of fear,” says the
  University of Michigan’s Stefan Syzmanski, “because of what terrible thing
  might happen to them” – namely, their team being taken away. When a team owner
  in the US asks for public money, there is the implicit or explicit threat of
  the owner moving the team if the municipality doesn’t cough up the dough. “As
  a matter of rote reflex,” Garofalo says, “they threaten to move the team. They
  have all the leverage to demand these subsidies” lest they have to rip up the
  team and move away – as, for example, happened when the NFL’s Chargers left
  San Diego for Los Angeles. “The fans treat the team as a community asset and
  the owners treat it as a private business.” But while American sports fans
  seem to respect team owners’ legal right to manipulate them by threatening to
  leave, in the UK, Szymanski says, the thinking is different. Relocating your
  team is “a borderline criminal activity.” And in general, fans don’t think the
  owners of their teams should get to do whatever they want. “Manchester United
  fans do not actually believe” that its proprietors, the Glazer family and Jim
  Ratcliffe, “own Manchester United,” Szymanski says. “That might be the legal
  position but the reality” is that they, the club’s supporters, are “the true
  owners” and that the Glazers and Ratcliffe are “temporary stewards – and
  pretty shitty ones, at that.”
