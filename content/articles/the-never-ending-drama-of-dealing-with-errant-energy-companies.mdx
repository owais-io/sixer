  Energy companies are never far from drama. Always creating new plots with
  twists and surprises, they have been gaslighting cowering customers for years.
  Here are three acts that should keep you on the edge of your seat. Act I The
  scene is Oxford where 90-year-old AB is battling phantoms. Ovo, his supplier,
  can’t decide whether it has received his monthly electricity payment. After a
  spate of demands for the £99.62 in question, it concedes, apologetically, that
  it received his cheque the previous month. Two months later it tells him he
  owes the £99.62 it has already cashed and adds a £15 late payment fee. When
  AB’s next payment is due he makes it over the phone. It comes to £129.19 and
  he asks for a receipt. Instead, he receives a letter accusing him of
  defaulting and demanding £129.19 plus a second £15 late payment fee. AB
  remonstrates; OVO says it will commence legal action. The card payment is
  never collected. Enter the consumer champion. Dealing with Ovo is like
  wrestling ectoplasm. Its first response blames AB for paying £99.62 by cheque.
  It claims it was invalid, despite having cashed it. And it says the “cheque”
  for £129.19 was also invalid, when, in fact, he made that payment by card.
  Oddly, since it insists AB was at fault, it says it will “write off” the £238
  it says has, by now, accrued on the account. When I query these discrepancies,
  it claims it never received the £99.62, despite having twice confirmed receipt
  in writing, and that the £129.19 was only partly settled by cheque, despite a
  card payment AB says he made. Back I go again. This time Ovo has a new line.
  It admits that the second payment was paid by card, but that it left an
  outstanding balance on the account. And it says it is not writing off the
  balance despite having told me, in writing, that it is. Instead, it is making
  a “generous goodwill gesture” for the “inconvenience” caused, although the
  common theme of its various explanations is that the “inconvenience” was
  entirely caused by him. By this time, the account is finally sorted, legal
  action is called off and I think it is all over. But no. A month later AB pays
  his latest £140 bill by cheque. This prompts three weeks of demands for £140.
  OVO tells me delays beyond its control prevented it cashing it, and offers to
  waive the inevitable £15 late payment fee as a “goodwill gesture”. I need a
  lie down. Act II Shepperton, Surrey. A routine boiler service reveals that
  81-year-old widower DG has been paying for a stranger’s gas since switching to
  E.ON Next four months previously. A meter mix up is blamed. No one knows who
  is footing the bill for DG’s consumption, but whoever it is, they are getting
  a good deal because he only spends three days a week in the home. E.ON is in
  no hurry to act. It informs him it could take up to 20 months to get answers
  because of a long list of similarly transposed meters. It tells me vaguely
  that his predicament could be caused by “any number of factors” and states,
  three months after he reported the problem, it is in the “preliminary stages”
  of its investigation, which it will complete in a “timely manner”. This, the
  more optimistic customer service agents told DG, could be within just 18
  months or even as few as 14. In the meantime, it asks him to provide regular
  meter readings to ensure bills are fair. The logic of that eludes me since
  DG’s meter is measuring someone else’s supply. Progress is made – backwards.
  My interference prompts a technician appointment, only no one shows up. DG has
  to wait five weeks for another slot. No one turns up. One day a technician
  arrives unsolicited. His intervention leaves DG with no heating or hot water.
  E.ON says it can’t help because it hadn’t arranged the visit. The problem is
  eventually resolved a speedy six months after he reported it. Act III Now
  we’re in Worcester. WL’s father, Walter Turner (assumed name) has sadly died.
  She wants to claim an eye-popping £1,896 credit accumulated on his British Gas
  account. She has been trying for nine months. British Gas acts promptly at
  first. It sends a cheque addressed to “Mr Estate of Walter Turner”.
  Unsurprisingly, it can’t be cashed. Four times WL asks that it be issued in
  her name, as executor. Four times British Gas promises to do so, and fails.
  The happy ending is that the corporate behemoths do empathise with private
  grief when they’re caught in the media spotlight. The cheque, plus a £75
  apology, arrives a week after I enter stage left.
