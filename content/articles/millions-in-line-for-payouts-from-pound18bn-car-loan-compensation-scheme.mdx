  Millions of drivers could be handed a share of a multibillion-pound
  compensation package after the City regulator said it would open a redress
  scheme for consumers affected by the car finance scandal. The Financial
  Conduct Authority (FCA) will consult on the redress scheme, which could cost
  banks between £9bn and £18bn when it begins paying consumers compensation next
  year. But motorists mis-sold car finance were warned that they are likely to
  get less than £950 a claim. The watchdog set out the plans after the supreme
  court largely overturned a ruling on car finance that could have led to
  compensation payouts of up to £44bn, a similar scale to the payment protection
  insurance (PPI) scandal. Bobby Dean, a Liberal Democrat MP and member of the
  influential Treasury committee, said mis-sold car finance remained “the
  biggest consumer finance scandal since PPI”. “Millions will be owed. The
  compensation bill is likely to surge above £10bn. Industry must learn that
  honesty matters and adjust their practices going forward accordingly,” he
  said. The FCA said it was unlikely that the price tag of its redress scheme –
  which will include administration costs – would be materially lower than £9bn
  and it could be “materially higher”. It added that while some scenarios put
  the total cost as high as £18bn, it considered estimates in the mid-point of
  this range “more plausible”. The regulator will start consulting on the scheme
  by October, and plans to include motorists who were harmed by discretionary
  commission arrangements. In most cases, the scheme would be likely to pay out
  less than £950 in compensation for each claim, it added. These discretionary
  commissions, which were banned in 2021, inflated the cost of car financing by
  allowing car dealers to claim higher commissions if they put customers on
  loans that earned higher interest rates for the lender. About 14.6m contracts
  included that arrangement between 2007 and 2020. The watchdog will also
  consult on broader motor financing issues where motorists may have been harmed
  by egregious or unfair commission arrangements. That would encompass a larger
  group of borrowers, and likely cover agreements between 2007 and 2024, the FCA
  said. On Friday the supreme court largely sided with finance companies by
  overturning an earlier ruling that the commissions were illegal. Judges upheld
  a single case that was deemed “unfair”, due in part to the size of the
  commission paid to the car dealer and how it was disclosed. Before the ruling,
  the Guardian revealed that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was so concerned
  about the anticipated impact of the supreme court ruling on lenders that she
  had considered attempting to overrule it. Nikhil Rathi, the FCA’s chief
  executive, said: “It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our
  rules. It’s fair for their customers to be compensated. We also want to ensure
  that the market, relied on by millions each year, can continue to work well
  and consumers can get a fair deal. “Our aim is a compensation scheme that’s
  fair and easy to participate in, so there’s no need to use a claims management
  company or law firm. If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any
  money you get. “It will take time to establish a scheme but we hope to start
  getting people any money they are owed next year.” The supreme court case was
  brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa’s
  FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won
  a court of appeal case in October. Justices were asked to review the court of
  appeal ruling, which suggested nearly all commission arrangements – unless
  plainly disclosed and issued under full consent of the consumer – were
  unlawful. If upheld, it would also have meant millions of people who bought a
  car with finance could be owed compensation at an estimated cost of up to
  £44bn to lenders including Santander UK, Close Brothers, Barclays and Lloyds.
  The sum would have almost rivalled the PPI saga, which cost banks about £50bn.
  The FCA said the final compensation scheme would have to balance a range of
  concerns, including the level of harm caused to consumers. However, it would
  also have to consider whether lenders may react to large payouts by pulling
  affordable loans from the market. The FCA said it needed to “ensure consumers
  continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles”. The car
  finance industry has claimed that a steep compensation bill would break some
  lenders, while others would be forced to offer fewer or more expensive loans
  to claw back their losses. The FCA also tried to manage expectations of large
  individual payouts, saying borrowers were unlikely to get back much more than
  the amount of commission originally paid to the car dealer. While interest
  would also be applied, that sum was likely to total about 3% a year. Any
  scheme that went beyond discretionary commissions would also consider a range
  of factors, including how financially literate the borrower was when they
  signed the contract, and how much information was provided. Martin Lewis, a
  consumer champion and the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said car lenders
  may still resist the financial watchdog’s redress plans. “The industry could
  fight this and it could fight it hard. What we need now is … consistency, we
  need transparency, and we need speed: both for the industry and for
  individuals to get through this. So I would hope that the industry doesn’t try
  to throw more legal wobblers to slow the whole thing down,” he said. Alex
  Neill, the co-founder of Consumer Voice, said: “This is a vital opportunity to
  restore trust and put right wrongdoing by dealers and lenders. But as ever,
  the devil will be in the details – the big test is whether the scheme will
  deliver a fair level of compensation at scale. “There will be big hurdles for
  the regulator to overcome including being able to engage all affected drivers
  and convincing consumers to trust a scheme run by the wrong-doers.” The FCA
  said it would ensure lenders assessed claims “consistently, efficiently and
  fairly”, adding that it would “monitor if firms are following the rules and
  act if they’re not.” The City regulator added that anyone concerned about
  their car finance agreement should contact their lender directlyMotorists who
  have already filed a complaint with their lender do not have to do anything,
  it said. Complaints will not be reviewed until at least December, after they
  were put on pause by the regulator.
