  Donald Trump’s frequently bizarre public appearances, which this month have
  seen the president claim, wrongly, that his uncle knew the Unabomber and rant
  unprompted about windmills on his recent trip to the UK, have once again
  raised questions about his mental acuity, experts say. For more than a year
  Trump, 79, has exhibited odd behavior at campaign events, in interviews, in
  his spontaneous remarks and at press conferences. The president repeatedly
  drifts off topic, including during a cabinet meeting this month when he spent
  15 minutes talking about decorating, and appears to misremember simple facts
  about his government and his life. During his presidency, Joe Biden was
  subjected to intense speculation over his mental acuity – including from
  Trump. After Biden’s disastrous debate performance in June 2024, when he
  repeatedly struggled to maintain his train of thought, scrutiny over Biden’s
  fitness eventually led to him not running for re-election. Trump, however, has
  largely been saved the same examination, despite examples of confusion and
  unusual behavior that have continued throughout his second term and were on
  full display on his recent trip to the UK. Over the weekend Trump, during a
  meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, abruptly
  switched from discussing immigration to saying this: “The other thing I say to
  Europe: we’ve – we will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States.
  They’re killing us. They’re killing the beauty of our scenery.” Trump
  proceeded to speak, non-stop and unprompted, for two minutes about windmills,
  claiming without evidence that they drive whales “loco” and that wind energy
  “kills the birds” (the proportion of birds killed by turbines is tiny compared
  with the number killed by domestic cats and from flying into power lines). The
  abrupt changes in conversation are an example of Trump “digressing without
  thinking – he’ll just switch topics without self-regulation, without having a
  coherent narrative”, said Harry Segal, a senior lecturer in the psychology
  department at Cornell University and in the psychiatry department at Weill
  Cornell Medicine. For years, Trump has batted away questions about his mental
  acuity, describing himself as a “stable genius” and bragging about “acing”
  exams – later revealed to be very simple tests – which check for early signs
  of dementia. But Democrats have begun to more aggressively question the
  president’s fitness, including Jasmine Crockett, the representative from
  Texas, and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and this week alone offered
  multiple examples of Trump exhibiting odd conduct. Asked about the famine in
  Gaza on Sunday, Trump seemed unable to remember the aid the US has given to
  Gaza, and forgot that others had also contributed. Trump claimed the US gave
  $60m “two weeks ago”. He added: “You really at least want to have somebody say
  thank you. No other country gave anything. “Nobody acknowledged it, nobody
  talks about it and it makes you feel a little bad when you do that and you
  know you have other countries not giving anything, none of the European
  countries by the way gave – I mean nobody gave but us.” Trump seemed to not
  realize or remember that other countries have given money to Gaza – the UK
  announced a £60m ($80m) package in July, and the European Union has allocated
  €170m ($195m) in aid. And the Guardian could not find any record of the US
  giving $60m to Gaza two weeks ago. In June, the US state department approved a
  $30m grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed by Israeli and
  US interests which has been criticized by Democrats as “connected to deadly
  violence against starving people seeking food in Gaza”. The White House did
  not respond to questions about Trump’s claimed $60m donation. Segal said
  another characteristic of Trump’s questionable mental acuity is confabulation.
  “It’s where he takes an idea or something that’s happened and he adds to it
  things that have not happened.” A high-profile example came in mid-July, when
  Trump claimed his uncle, the late professor John Trump, had taught Ted
  Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, at MIT. Trump recalled: “I said:
  ‘What kind of a student was he, Uncle John? Dr John Trump.’ I said: ‘What kind
  of a student?’ And then he said: ‘Seriously, good.’ He said: ‘He’d correct –
  he’d go around correcting everybody.’ But it didn’t work out too well for
  him.” The problem is: that cannot possibly be true. First, Trump’s uncle died
  in 1985, and Kaczynski was only publicly identified as the Unabomber in 1996.
  Second, Kaczynski did not study at MIT. “The story makes no sense whatsoever,
  but it’s told in a very warm, reflective way, as if he’s remembering it,”
  Segal said. “This level of thinking really has been deteriorating.” Aside from
  the confabulation, there have been times when Trump seems unable to focus.
  During the 2024 campaign there was the bizarre sight of Trump spending 40
  minutes swaying to music onstage after a medical emergency at one of his
  campaign rallies. Trump’s rambling speeches during his campaign – he would
  frequently drift between topics in a technique he described as “the weave” –
  also drew scrutiny. The White House removed official transcripts of Trump’s
  remarks from its website in May, claiming it was part of an effort to
  “maintain consistency”. It is worth reading Trump’s remarks in full, however,
  to get a sense of how the president speaks on a day-to-day basis. At the
  beginning of July, Trump was asked, “What is the next campaign promise that
  you plan to fulfill to the American people?” He then rambled about meeting
  foreign leaders and removing regulations, adding: I got rid of – just one I
  got rid of the other night, you buy a house, they have a faucet in the house,
  Joe, and the faucet the water doesn’t come out. They have a restrictor. You
  can’t – in areas where you have so much water they don’t know what to do with
  it. Uh, you have a shower head the shower doesn’t uh, the shower doesn’t, you
  think it’s not working. It is working. The water’s dripping out and that’s no
  good for me. I like this hair lace and [sic] – I like that hair nice and wet.
  Takes you – you have to stand in the shower for 20 minutes before you get the
  soap out of your hair. And I put a, a thing – and it sounds funny but it’s
  really not. It’s horrible. And uh, when you wash your hands, you turn on the
  faucet, no water comes out. You’re washing whole – water barely comes out it’s
  ridi – this was done by crazy people. And I wor – wrote it all off and got it
  approved in Congress so that they can’t just change it.” “Any fair-minded
  mental-health expert would be very worried about Donald Trump’s performance,”
  Richard A Friedman, a professor of clinical psychiatry and the director of the
  psychopharmacology clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College, wrote in the
  Atlantic, after a stumbling performance from Trump in his debate against
  Kamala Harris last September. He added: “If a patient presented to me with the
  verbal incoherence, tangential thinking, and repetitive speech that Trump now
  regularly demonstrates, I would almost certainly refer them for a rigorous
  neuropsychiatric evaluation to rule out a cognitive illness.” At a recent
  cabinet meeting called to discuss the flooding tragedy in Texas, the war in
  Ukraine and Gaza, the bombing of Iran, and global tariffs, Trump went on a
  13-minute monologue about how he had decorated the cabinet meeting room. After
  talking about paintings which he said he had personally selected from “the
  vaults”, Trump said. “Look at those frames, you know, I’m a frame person,
  sometimes I like frames more than I like the pictures,” and added he had
  overseen the cleaning of some china. As department heads, including the
  defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio,
  waited to be dismissed so they could go and do their jobs, Trump continued:
  Here we put out – you know these, these lamps have been very important
  actually, whether people love them or not but they’re if you see pictures like
  Pearl Harbor or Tora! Tora! Tora!, you see movies about the White House where
  wars are being discussed, oftentimes they’ll show those lamps or something
  like those lamps, something that looks like them. Probably not the reals,
  because I don’t think they’re allowed to – this is a very important room, this
  is a sacred room, and I don’t think they made movies from here. You never know
  what they do. But they were missing, er, medallions. See the medallions on
  top? They had a chain going into the ceiling. And I said: ‘You can’t do that.
  You have to have a medallion.’ They said, ‘What’s a medallion?’ I said: ‘I’ll
  show you.’ And then we got some beautiful medallions, and you see them, they
  were put up there, makes the lamps look [inaudible] so we did these changes.
  And when you think of it, the cost was almost nothing. We also painted the
  room a nice color, beige color, and it’s been really something. The only
  question is, will I gold-leaf the corners? You could maybe tell me. My cabinet
  could take a vote. You see the top-line moldings, and the only question is do
  you go and leaf it? Because you can’t paint it, if you paint it it won’t look
  good because they’ve never found a paint that looks like gold. You see that in
  the Oval Office. Er, they’ve tried for years and years. Somebody could become
  very wealthy, but they’ve never found a paint that looks like gold. So
  painting is easy but it won’t look right.” The White House pushes back
  aggressively on the issue of Trump’s mental fitness. “The Guardian is a
  left-wing mouthpiece that should be embarrassed to pass off deranged
  resistance leftists as ‘experts’. Anyone pathetic enough to defend Biden’s
  mental state – while being labeled as unethical by their peers – has zero
  credibility. President Trump’s mental sharpness is second to none and he is
  working around the clock to secure amazing deals for the American people,”
  said a White House spokesperson, Liz Huston. So do his political allies. “As
  President Trump’s former personal physician, former physician to the
  president, and White House physician for 14 years across three
  administrations, I can tell you unequivocally: President Donald J Trump is the
  healthiest president this nation has ever seen. I continue to consult with his
  current physician and medical team at the White House and still spend
  significant time with the president. He is mentally and physically sharper
  than ever before,” said the Republican congressman Ronny Jackson. In April,
  Trump’s White House physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, wrote that the president
  “exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute
  the duties of the commander-in-chief and head of state”. He said Trump was
  assessed for cognitive function, which was normal. That report hasn’t stopped
  people from questioning Trump’s mental acuity. “What we see are the classic
  signs of dementia, which is gross deterioration from someone’s baseline and
  function,” John Gartner, a psychologist and author who spent 28 years as an
  assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University Medical School,
  said in June. “If you go back and look at film from the 1980s, [Trump]
  actually was extremely articulate. He was still a jerk, but he was able to
  express himself in polished paragraphs, and now he really has trouble
  completing a thought and that is a huge deterioration.” Gartner, who during
  Trump’s first term co-founded Duty to Warn, a group of mental health
  professionals who believed Trump had the personality disorder malignant
  narcissism, warned: “I predicted before the election that he would probably
  fall off the cliff before the end of his term. And at the rate he is
  deteriorating, you know … we’ll see. “But the point is that it’s going to get
  worse. That’s my prediction.”
