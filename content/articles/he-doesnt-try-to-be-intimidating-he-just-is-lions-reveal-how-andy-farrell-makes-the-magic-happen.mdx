  Sitting in a car wash with the windows jammed open would be marginally drier
  than walking the streets of Sydney this week. The forecast rain stayed away
  for the decisive second Test in Melbourne, but the outlook for the Accor
  Stadium on Saturday is properly damp. Not that the Lions are overly bothered
  as they seek to squeeze every last drop of joy out of their tour of Australia.
  From the moment they met up the mantra of this party has been based on showing
  the absolute best of themselves in the Test matches and winning the series
  3-0. Nothing has changed in that regard, as reflected in Farrell’s largely
  rinse‑and-repeat final-Test selection, with the exception of Blair Kinghorn
  and James Ryan being elevated to the starting XV and a forward-loaded 6-2
  bench split. As anyone with knowledge of Farrell’s competitive instincts will
  be aware, the chances of him easing off the downcast Wallabies at this late
  juncture were always on the nonexistent side of slim. A final flourish is not
  always easily achieved at the end of a long, punishing season, but, in this
  case, all the most influential Lions are fit and hungry and motivation is not
  a problem. Aside from enjoying each other’s company, the players have also
  responded well to Farrell’s management style, among the primary reasons why
  this large tour party has stayed fully united. “He’s been really good at
  getting everyone closer,” said the Scotland centre Huw Jones, set to become a
  member of a prestigious Lions club by starting all three Tests. “I don’t
  really know how he’s done it, but it’s worked. “I wasn’t really sure what to
  expect from the outside. He’s very calm and relaxed a lot of the time, [but]
  when he’s on, he’s pretty intense. When we’re training he’s always on and
  doesn’t miss a beat. He sees everything and he’s prepared to call you out in
  the middle of the session if something’s not good enough. “There’s no hiding
  place, his standards are so high. He’s very clear about what he wants and how
  he wants you to do it. He’s been brilliant and it’s great to be part of the
  squad under that leadership.” Jones, who will again partner Bundee Aki in
  midfield, was also good value on the subject of Farrell’s presence and rugby
  instincts. “He doesn’t need to try to be intimidating, he just is. Some people
  just have that presence. He’s obviously massive. Without meaning to be, he’s
  just an intimidating person. Not in a bad way, but in a good way that commands
  respect. When he speaks everyone is listening. I’m yet to hear him say
  something I don’t agree with, he reads the game so well. “If you are walking,
  haven’t quite got into position or if you are not talking to someone he will
  pick it up … and you will know about it. It is about not accepting anything
  average or mediocre you may be able to get away with at your club. We are here
  because we were selected as being the best of our international teams. You
  have to show up and prove that every day.” A resounding final performance,
  accordingly, is the objective of all concerned, Farrell included. When he says
  winning 3-0 “would mean the world to us” he is reiterating his belief that
  aiming high is vital, in sport and life. “I never think you should shy away
  from shooting for the stars because you might end up on the moon,” he said.
  “That’s pretty good as well. “What’s there to be shy about? Players, coaches,
  staff, Lions fans, everyone … they all want to win every game. You can’t be
  frightened of that.” Just as telling, perhaps, is that even the 16 unlucky
  individuals – 12 original selections and four replacements – who have had no
  involvement in the Tests have felt as much a part of campaign as the 27 who
  have. “It touches you,” said Farrell. “The ones that were celebrating most
  last Saturday were the ones who hadn’t put the shirt on. That says it all.”
  All that remains, then, is for the chosen few to go out and apply the coup de
  grace. In the first half in Brisbane and the second half in Melbourne these
  Lions have shown what they can do; not so much at other times. On this
  occasion, Farrell would settle for 70 minutes of excellence that, on the
  evidence to date, should be enough: “We know what we’re capable of in all
  sorts of areas, so getting close to eight or nine out of 10 in all of them
  would be somewhere close to where we want to be.” Jones feels much the same as
  he prepares for his own final fling. “We’ve probably not played to our full
  capacity yet. That’s been the message this week: to try and have our best
  performance of the tour. To do it in the last game, to win 3-0 – that would be
  amazing. That’s where the motivation is.” It takes more than a spot of rain to
  dilute the resolve of Farrell and co.
