  Alexander Isak’s rental home on market amid push for move to Liverpool from
  Newcastle

  The house Alexander Isak has been living in just outside Newcastle is back on
  the rental market. The striker is trying to secure a move to Liverpool and it
  emerged on Tuesday that new tenants are being sought. Removal vans have been
  sighted at Isak’s Ponteland home, which is understood to have been put on the
  market some weeks ago. The Sweden international started renting the property
  after he joined Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022. Burglars raided the
  house in April 2024, stealing jewellery and money and taking Isak’s car. The
  player’s victim impact statement, read in court this year, said the attack had
  left him “with a sense of unease and I fear it could reoccur”. Isak signalled
  his determination to force a transfer by not going on Newcastle’s pre-season
  tour to Singapore and South Korea last month and he has been ordered by Eddie
  Howe to train alone. The manager also banned the Sweden international from a
  training‑ground barbecue last week. Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak
  turned down but remain determined to sign the 25‑year‑old striker, who has
  scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances. He is valued by Newcastle at
  £150m but it would be a surprise if a compromise were not found for the move
  to go ahead. That is contingent on Newcastle buying at least one striker. A
  deal for the Brentford centre-forward Yoane Wissa is expected to be concluded
  this week and Porto’s Samu Aghehowa is among other targets. Isak was handed a
  shirt number on Tuesday when Newcastle published their squad list, retaining
  the No 14 he has worn since he joined. Howe has no intention of using Isak on
  Saturday in the opening game at Aston Villa – the manager has said he only
  wants players who “really want to play for this football club”. Newcastle,
  meanwhile, completed the signing of the Milan defender Malick Thiaw on Tuesday
  night. The Germany international joins Howe’s side for a reported £34.6m,
  including add‑ons. He is the club’s third significant summer signing, after
  the forward Anthony Elanga and the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. Liverpool are
  advancing in talks with Crystal Palace over a previous Newcastle target, Marc
  Guéhi. They start their season on Friday at home to Bournemouth. A moment’s
  silence will be observed at all top-flight matches in the opening round in
  memory of the Liverpool forward Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva, who
  died last month.
