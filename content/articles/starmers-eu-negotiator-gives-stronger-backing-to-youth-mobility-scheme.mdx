  Keir Starmer’s lead negotiator on Europe has enthused about how excited he is
  by the prospect of an EU youth mobility scheme, as he signalled a broader
  government shift towards embracing closer ties with the bloc. Nick
  Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of negotiating Britain’s
  relationship with the EU, said on Wednesday he was looking forward to signing
  a deal to let young people travel and work more freely across Europe. His tone
  contrasted with that struck just a few months ago, when the government would
  not even say whether it was willing to enter negotiations over such a scheme.
  He made the comments during a speech in which he promised to agree a new
  agricultural export deal by the start of 2027, as ministers begin to talk more
  openly about their desire to move closer to Brussels. “I’m very excited that
  the youth experience [scheme] gives us great opportunities for Brits to be
  able to go overseas to experience different cultures. Its going to be
  fantastic,” Thomas-Symonds said. “I would say to parliamentary colleagues,
  it’s going to be all about MPs of all parties actually showcasing the
  opportunities of young British people.” Thomas-Symonds has led negotiations
  over Starmer’s reset in EU relations, which culminated earlier this year in an
  agreement to start talks over both an agricultural deal and a youth mobility
  scheme. He said on Wednesday he wanted to have the new export agreement in
  place by the start of 2027, giving the government 18 months to complete the
  negotiations. British officials will be pushing for exemptions to EU rules
  such as restrictions on developing genetically modified crops, while France,
  in particular, is likely to ask the government to drop its pre-election pledge
  to ban imports of foie gras. Thomas-Symonds admitted the UK would be asking
  for carve-outs from European rules, but said that Britain would seek to
  “dynamically align” with the EU, meaning its regulations will change in line
  with European ones in the future. The principle of dynamic alignment was for
  many years a bete noire for Brexit supporters, who said it would mean ceding
  control of British regulations to Brussels. Thomas-Symonds sought to make a
  virtue of it, however, saying: “We are choosing to align with common high
  standards because it is in our national economic interest and will save
  businesses up and down the country.” His warm words about a youth mobility
  scheme were a departure from recent ministerial reluctance to discuss such a
  possibility for fear of reopening the debate over free movement from the EU.
  It reflects an increasing confidence in Labour circles that they can win the
  argument over European relations, even as they worry about how to combat Nigel
  Farage’s message on immigration. “Nigel Farage can’t bring himself to have any
  relationship with the EU … because Nigel Farage wants Britain to fail,”
  Thomas-Symonds said. Asked, however, to rebut Farage’s comments on Tuesday
  that asylum seekers had mounted an “invasion” of Britain, the minister said:
  “We all use our own, language. I wouldn’t use Nigel Farage’s language.”
