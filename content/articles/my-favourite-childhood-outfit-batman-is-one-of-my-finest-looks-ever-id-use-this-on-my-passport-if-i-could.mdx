  What I love about this photo is that it couldn’t look any more early 80s if it
  tried. Everything from the velvet curtains to the plastic flowers, the
  old-school cathode-ray tube TV to the MK1 metallic purple Ford Escort just in
  view (the one in which I would later learn to drive), screams 1981. Pictured,
  we have Pandy the bear; my younger brother Jon, five; Sooty; and yours truly,
  aged seven, all of us covering a variety of skin and hair colours between us.
  (Like all the best superheroes, I’m adopted.) The photo would have been taken
  by my dad using his Kodak camera with flash cube, sporting bell-bottomed jeans
  and sideburns, while my mum, with her beehive haircut, sipping a Babycham,
  would probably have been on hand for moral support. These outfits were made by
  our gran (my mum’s mum), who was as much a whiz with the sewing machine and a
  knitting needle as she was with a wooden spoon, and would make us outfits for
  birthdays and Christmases, as well as baking us a seemingly never-ending
  supply of chocolate cake. This photo would have been taken at a time when the
  unwritten rules of being an older brother had already been established. I got
  the top bunk – because I’m oldest. I got the biggest slice – because I’m
  oldest. I got to sit in the front seat – because I’m oldest. I’m Batman and
  you’re Robin – because I’m oldest. Although thinking about it, an R for
  Richard on my chest would have been more fitting. Pandy and Sooty later
  received their own knitted Batman and Robin costumes (Sooty got to be Batman,
  because he’s the oldest). Dressed as a seven-year-old superhero, this has to
  be one of my finest looks to date. I’d use it as my passport photo and
  Guardian byline pic, if I could. The fir tree on the coffee table indicates
  it’s Christmas. I specifically remember going upstairs to change, coming back
  down, and my dad introducing the gathered family to Batman and Robin. “Where
  have Rich and Jon gone?” everyone clearly wondered. I don’t think we came out
  of disguise for the whole of Christmas Day, then Boxing Day and the rest of
  the week, by which time our outfits would have been covered in gravy,
  Christmas pudding and – yes – Gran’s chocolate cake. This was almost a decade
  before Michael Keaton’s moody Batman, and – yikes! – almost 30 years before
  Christian Bale’s even moodier The Dark Knight. Our outfits are modelled on the
  1960s Adam West and Burt Ward “Wham! Ker-pow! Ker-splunk!” Batman, which we’d
  watch with my dad in the 70s and 80s. Personally, I think I’ve nailed the camp
  humour of the original, although I don’t remember Batman wearing brown flannel
  trousers like mine – at least, not for any of his public appearances. It might
  have been a bit much to have expected my gran to knit Batman’s yellow utility
  belt and Robin’s oversized green underpants, too. Although, I’m sure, if we’d
  asked, she would have given it her best superhero shot.
