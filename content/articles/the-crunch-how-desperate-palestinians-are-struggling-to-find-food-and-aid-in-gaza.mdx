  The Crunch: how desperate Palestinians are struggling to find food and aid in
  Gaza

  Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch! More Palestinians died of
  starvation in the past week than in the preceding 21 months, prompting
  widespread condemnation of Israel’s actions. As a result, much of the media’s
  focus has been on the desperate suffering of the Palestinians. So we are doing
  something slightly different in this newsletter: a spotlight on
  data-visualisation about how people in Gaza are being killed and injured while
  seeking aid. There’s also a collection of other things that caught our eye
  this fortnight towards the end of the newsletter. 1. An eleven-minute race for
  food The four aid distribution sites across Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian
  Foundation (GHF) are only open for a few minutes a day – the Saudi site was
  open for an average of 11 minutes in June. Our colleagues in the UK put
  together this visual explainer on “how aid points in Gaza became death traps”.
  This chart shows the time between aid sites opening and closing through June
  and July: Palestinians in Gaza have to queue and walk kilometres – through
  evacuation zones that civilians have been told to leave – to reach aid sites.
  The piece also includes maps if, like us, you are having trouble getting your
  head around this geography. *** 2. Average daily calories in Gaza Our
  colleague Mona Chalabi also posted this devastating graphic on Instagram
  comparing the average calories consumed by someone in Gaza in May, to the
  daily recommended amount: We’ve often featured Mona’s spectacular work,
  including this one on Gaza’s population as 100 people, and the population
  density of bombed cities. *** 3. Aid sites and access routes The Economist
  also covered the GHF aid sites ($), with a series of excellent maps and
  satellite images showing the long walks and the huge crowds forming at
  checkpoints. Among other things, this really drives home the distances that
  families are forced to travel to get aid. *** 4. Huge crowds for aid convoy To
  give more context around the scale of the desperation for aid, the New York
  Times reports on a satellite image of huge crowds gathering around aid trucks
  taken in Gaza last week: Not a lot is known about where these trucks were
  going or what they were carrying. The NYT has also published a map showing
  which countries have already recognised a Palestinian state. *** 5.
  Environmental devastation in Gaza Environmental devastation is an
  under-reported aspect of the destruction in Gaza. Bloomberg analysis of
  satellite data has found nearly 350 sites where waste has been piling up since
  the conflict began. This map shows Souk Feras, which was a market before the
  conflict began but now holds an estimated 200,000 metric tons of rubbish: The
  Bloomberg team estimates that new garbage sites cover more than 1 sq
  kilometre, about 60% of the areas are close to tents, and 15% are near water,
  sanitation or other “hygiene sites”. Read (and see) more here. Other things
  from the fortnight We published this One Big Chart on increasing student debt
  held by younger Australians The Pudding launched an amazing project to make
  signs and other text in New York City streets searchable The Australian Bureau
  of Statistics made a bar chart about all the other charts they’ve made this
  year We couldn’t stop playing with the Mac emulators in this story about Mac
  settings (we’re counting this as data-vis as you can actually manipulate
  spreadsheets in some of the emulated computers) Reuters have an illustrated
  explainer of the crash of Air India flight 171 Sign up If you would like to
