  Australian rugby back?

  For 18 minutes, everything was going according to script. The double world
  champions were running riot at Ellis Park, stomping over the gain line with
  every carry, shrugging off tacklers and hammering anyone unlucky enough to be
  wearing a gold jersey. Australia had touched the ball twice before Kurt-Lee
  Arendse scored the opening try; once when Nic White kicked off, then again
  when Tom Wright spilled a contestable kick. Twelve minutes later André
  Esterhuizen sliced through the right before Siya Kolisi bulldozed over under
  the posts. Manie Libbok kicked seven extra points to nudge the score to 22-0
  in South Africa’s favour. We’d not yet reached the quarter mark of this
  one-sided contest. Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii had his nose bloodied by Eben
  Etzebeth. Will Skelton was being bullied. O’Connor, parachuted in at fly-half,
  had been steamrolled on three occasions. The Wallabies had arrived in
  Johannesburg with reputations enhanced after their Lions series defeat. This
  felt like a reality check. And then Fraser McReight won a penalty on the
  ground in his own 22. “Momentum” is an overused word in rugby, usually cited
  only in hindsight. Yet this was the spark. It was here that Australia turned
  around, dug their heels in and fired shots of their own. It was here that
  Australian rugby under Joe Schmidt ascended another level. Four consecutive
  penalties later and Dylan Pietsch was sliding over in the corner. South
  Africa’s failings compounded matters. “We were really dogshit on the day,”
  their coach Rassie Erasmus said. Too often they overplayed and were inaccurate
  in the red zone. Their inability to secure the ball was a concern against
  Italy and Georgia during the July internationals. Now it is a glaring
  weakness. Any team with a back row as dynamic as the one under Schmidt’s watch
  will cause the Boks a world of trouble. Two minutes after the restart Nick
  Frost nicked a lineout. Then Angus Bell thumped Malcolm Marx before finding
  Harry Wilson on a superb line. Ellis Park was hushed, as if 60,000 people
  realised at once that the Springboks’ aura of invincibility was just a story
  they’d been told. The players seemed to sense it too. Most of them lifted the
  Webb Ellis Cup two years ago after a hat-trick of one-point victories. They’ve
  made a habit of snatching triumphs from hopeless causes but momentum was fully
  against them. Perhaps this is why Libbok forced the issue from inside his own
  half with an ambitious floating pass only to see Suaalii pluck it from the
  thin Highveld air and dot it down for a try on the hour. Wilson had his
  second, sparked by the magnificent Wright who didn’t put a foot wrong after
  that opening knock-on, to give Australia the lead. Mere seconds after the
  restart Max Jorgensen was flying down the right tramline to open up the
  advantage. And when McReight stooped low with just seven minutes left, getting
  his meaty frame over the ball with the Boks swarming inside Australia’s 22,
  the game was won. Wright’s cherry-on-the-top, counterattacking, zigzagging try
  turned the result from a nail-biting upset to a bona fide shellacking. Make no
  mistake, this is the biggest hiding the world champions have copped since
  their fairytale run began in 2019. “I don’t think it was about one moment,”
  Schmidt said when asked how his team pulled this off. “It was about sticking
  to what we’d talked about all week. The boys showed a lot of courage, and when
  we got a foothold, we kept building.” That is the emerging story of Schmidt’s
  Wallabies: a side that doesn’t collapse but grows when written off. They stole
  a late win at Twickenham last year, rallied against the Lions after a poor
  first Test, and now turned a 22-point deficit into a first win in Johannesburg
  since 1963. Does all this put the Lions series result in context? Are South
  Africa’s veterans now a step behind? Are they caught between two philosophies,
  one that trusts in traditional might while the other compels them to run it
  from deep? Can we declare that Aussie rugby is officially back? This always
  seems to happen when Australia flips the script and produces something
  special. But maybe this is the script. Maybe a team with a solid set-piece, a
  totem in the lineout, berserkers at the breakdown, ballers in the midfield and
  dazzlers in the backfield are simply a formidable outfit that deserve more
  respect than they’ve been shown. Maybe those players under the guidance of a
  coach who appreciates rugby’s fundamentals and knows how to get the most out
  of his charges can be more than just a plucky side character. If this is
  indeed the redrafting of a story we thought we all knew, then the entire sport
  will be better for it. Not that Erasmus will be too bothered with all that.
  He’ll already be plotting a way back in the sequel next week.
