  now thrives

  “You must see this!” Marc Outten shoulders past tangles of blackthorn and
  shimmies around hummocks of blackberries the size of buses and glades filled
  with wildflowers. What beautiful wildlife spectacle awaits? Weaving across
  carpets of bird’s foot trefoil, we reach our destination: a vast, barren
  circle of asphalt, 70 metres across – the ruins of an uncompleted oil
  refinery. “You’ll find rare bees and reptiles around the edge and you’ve got
  these lovely stonecrops and lichens,” enthuses Outten, a naturalist and RSPB’s
  site manager for Canvey Wick nature reserve. The derelict asphalt pad is
  buzzing with rare nature. This “ruined” landscape – where disused street lamps
  poke up above rampant scrub – resembles some kind of post-apocalyptic London.
  But in its ruination, this brownfield site beside the Thames in Essex has
  become one of the most nature-rich places in Britain, home to 3,200 species
  including endangered shrill carder bees, pantaloon bees, water vole, cuckoos
  and long-eared owls. Canvey Wick is celebrating its 20th anniversary as a site
  of special scientific interest (SSSI) as conservationists warn many similarly
  wildlife-rich brownfield sites are threatened by development, particularly in
  the Thames Gateway. Tilbury ash fields, home to 185 invertebrate species of
  conservation concern including the great sneak-spider, is imperilled by plans
  to expand the port of Tilbury. Meanwhile, a Google datacentre is proposed on a
  local wildlife site close to Lakeside that is home to nightingales, rare
  plants and scarce invertebrates such as the brown-banded carder bee. Canvey
  Wick shows what can happen when a brownfield site is protected. Since it was
  bought by the Land Trust and managed by the RSPB in partnership with Buglife,
  an astonishing range of rare species have made their home on its 93 hectares
  (230 acres): 11.7% of its 3,200 species are classified as rare, scarce,
  threatened or near threatened. Eight years ago, there were no nightingales on
  Canvey Wick. Today there are 21 nightingale territories in the thickets of
  blackthorn, hawthorn and bramble – a vital new stronghold for the much-loved
  but endangered songbird. “People assume that brownfield sites are very low
  value for biodiversity – until they see what a brownfield site can really do,”
  said Outten, on a tour of the site during which we find pantaloon bees,
  spectacular Jersey tiger moths and increasingly rare wall brown butterflies.
  “If brownfield sites are left to sit around for a while, they develop into
  really rich habitats. This would’ve been a very desolate space full of sand,
  concrete and tarmac and now we’ve got this wonderful nature reserve. There’s
  so much structural diversity and the more structural diversity you have, the
  more biodiversity you have – that’s what makes this place so special.” Canvey
  Wick was green grazing marshes until humans ruined them – and inadvertently
  made one of the most nature-rich places in Britain. An oil refinery was
  planned for Canvey Wick in the early 1970s. The ground was raised with
  dredging from the Thames: sands, shingle and even seashells. Concrete roads
  and street lamps were built. Thirty two and a half circular asphalt pads were
  constructed as bases for vast oil storage containers. And then the 1973 oil
  price shock halted work. The refinery was abandoned. Over the next 50 years,
  nature raced in. The unusual diversity of soil types and hot microclimates
  attracted an unusual range of invertebrates: there are 250 species of bee,
  wasp and ant on the site, including the brown-banded carder bee, five-banded
  weevil-wasp and carrot mining bee. They feed on an unconventional mix of
  native and non-native flowers including bristly oxtongue and everlasting pea.
  As the human ruins subside beneath greenery, conservationists must manage the
  rapidly changing site to balance the competing needs of different rare
  species. What’s great for nightingales – more scrub – will cause many
  heat-loving invertebrates to disappear. When the site was first designated an
  SSSI in 2005, there was just 15% scrub and tree cover. Today it is more like
  70%. “Some scrub is great but having that open mosaic flower-rich grassland is
  really important,” says Outten. “How do you strike the balance between
  clearing areas and retaining nightingale habitat? A lot of this is
  cutting-edge stuff. ‘Restoring’ brownfield is not something many organisations
  have got into.” A three-year project at Canvey has cut back some scrub, and
  created new scrapes of bare sand required by rare invertebrates and species
  such as adders. The cut-and-scraped areas are now burgeoning with wildflowers
  and insects again, while cleared ditches are home to scarce emerald
  damselflies and blue-eyed hawker dragonflies. Conservationists hope it will
  inspire the creation of more brownfield nature reserves. “Canvey Wick
  demonstrates how brownfield sites can be transformed into vibrant green spaces
  that serve the community and provide important habitats for wildlife,” says
  Alan Carter, the chief executive of the Land Trust. “We are extremely proud of
  the regeneration efforts carried out since taking on the ownership of the site
  in 2012. The site is now one of the top locations in Britain for endangered
  invertebrates, an impressive achievement.” Although important parts of
  Swanscombe peninsula were saved from development threats when Natural England
  designated it an SSSI in 2021, Buglife is calling on the government’s wildlife
  watchdog to urgently give more sites the same protection, including Tilbury
  ash fields. Natural England has “Thames estuary invertebrates” in Essex and
  Kent listed in its SSSI designation “pipeline” but the watchdog has been
  criticised for failing to designate many endangered places in recent years.
  Carl Bunnage, head of nature policy at RSPB, said: “Brownfield sites are not
  always just dead, ugly and abandoned spaces. Indeed, as Canvey Wick shows,
  they can provide specialist habitats and be havens for nature – full of life
  of all kinds. With the government currently driving reforms to the planning
  system in England, and prioritising the re-development of brownfield sites, it
  is vital that the nature-value of sites is properly assessed before planning
  decisions are taken.” Conservationists hope Canvey Wick can also inspire
  smaller ways of attracting rare wildlife: depositing piles of sand or crushed
  concrete on a place may not look conventionally pretty but it will create
  soils and microclimates where myriad wildflowers and invertebrates can thrive.
  Outten, who was raised in the area, hopes Canvey will inspire the creation of
  other similar nature reserves so there is a network for rare species, which
  can be enjoyed by the local community as well. “People feel passionately about
  it. We want to strike the balance between giving people a place where they can
  access green space but also protect the species that the site is important
  for. It’s a unique place. There’s nowhere else like it,” he said.
