  As scholars dedicated to questions of justice and ethics, we believe that
  Yvette Cooper’s recent proscription of Palestine Action represents an attack
  both on the entire pro-Palestine movement and on fundamental freedoms of
  expression, association, assembly and protest. We deplore the repressive
  consequences that this ban has already had, and are especially concerned about
  the likely impact of Cooper’s ban on universities across the UK and beyond. We
  therefore applaud the growing campaign of collective defiance that aims to
  overturn the ban. We commend the courageous stand taken by Defend Our Juries,
  and the exemplary recent motion adopted by Derry City and Strabane district
  council that “supports all those who have protested the ban on Palestine
  Action and calls for charges against them to be immediately dropped”. In
  alliance with thousands of trade unionists, teachers and students throughout
  the UK and abroad, we affirm our own solidarity with all those who are
  campaigning against the proscription. We fully share the aim of ending the
  flow of weapons from Britain to Israel and the belief that all participants in
  the pro-Palestine movement should be free to make our own decisions about how
  best to achieve that goal. We remind the UK government that its own most
  urgent priorities should already be determined by its binding obligation “to
  prevent and to punish” genocide. As the organisers of massive national
  demonstrations face prosecution, as hundreds of people again risk arrest by
  joining street protests on 9 August, and as students and teachers prepare for
  the start of another turbulent academic year, we express our full solidarity
  with those mobilising on their campuses or in their workplaces and communities
  to put an immediate stop to the escalating genocide and to end all UK
  complicity with Israel’s crimes. Gilbert Achcar Emeritus professor of
