  Celebrities like Andie MacDowell and Pamela Anderson are all for the grey
  revolution – are older women caring less about what people think?

  I am noticing a growing movement where women are less concerned about looking
  their age, whether it’s makeup-free Pamela, silver and chic Andie Macdowell,
  or Ashley Judd not caring what we think about her swimsuit-clad mature form in
  a splashy Instagram frolic. In fact, it almost seems like older women are
  caring less about what people think about their appearance, despite other age
  groups feeling less confident than they did a decade ago. This isn’t to say
  that older women don’t want to present themselves in fashionable and stylish
  ways like their younger counterparts; they’ve just probably grown a little
  tired of the narrow societal expectations of having to look the youngest they
  possibly can. There is a growing and healthier trend where more women openly
  discuss their age, the challenges of growing older and how to maximise their
  years without necessarily prioritising beauty. This is one of the core
  messages of the Silver Sirens group who hold various events annually for women
  over 50. Celebrities like Naomi Watts are discussing perimenopause on shows
  and podcasts; influencers are celebrating their silver locks on Instagram; and
  Hollywood is celebrating more women over 40 than ever before. Of course, “age
  empowerment” is still a mixed bag of confused messages. We have been exposed
  to stereotypes from such a young age and, because of this, uncoupling notions
  of youth and beauty does not come that naturally. We’re still brainwashed to
  think that ageing cannot coexist with beauty. However, VOGUE Philippines – who
  featured 106 year old traditional tattooist Apo Whang-Od on their cover in
  April 2023 – would disagree. We grew up watching fairy tales where women were
  often depicted as either young, beautiful and wholesome, or old, ugly and
  mean. No wonder it has been a challenge to shirk off those internalised
  feelings that equates being older to automatically being considered
  unattractive. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Often, anti-ageing
  products marketed to us purport to be supportive of our ageing faces, when in
  reality they are still trading on the same tired narrative that looking
  younger equals looking better. The global cosmetic industry generates over
  $624bn dollars in revenue annually mining embedded age-related insecurities.
  We live in a time when we are saturated by social media images of beautiful,
  youthful-looking influencers and beauty products. For this reason, body image
  issues are particularly strong within younger generations, with one study of
  over 1,000 participants finding that 58% of girls aged 15 to 24 do not have a
  positive view of their physical appearance. Another study found that 7 million
  adult Australians (38% of the population) are considering getting cosmetic
  surgery. However, the grey revolution is here, and growing, using the same
  digital media. The good news is that at a certain point in life we become less
  focused on our outer appearance and more attuned to the quiet experience of
  our inner life – and the number of years that we probably have left comes into
  sharp relief. It is often around midlife that this realisation – recognised as
  “future time perspective” – sees us prioritising and rearranging our lives to
  experience what matters most. Laura Carstensen, the director of the Stanford
  Centre on Longevity, describes it as the tendency to focus on and appreciate
  meaningful experiences as our time becomes limited. Transitioning into midlife
  is when we cross the cultural border from younger to older and where we
  possibly cling to an identity that is still grounded in our physical
  appearance. Arguably, the more negative age stereotypes we unconsciously
  harbour, the more difficult the transition. But many older people report
  feelings of gratitude just to be alive and to have their health. By this stage
  in life we’ve had, or have known someone with a serious or chronic illness
  and, indeed, we have lost loved ones too. These experiences may frame our
  ageing journeys a little differently; we become grateful for ageing at this
  point. I realise there are more important things in the world right now than
  contemplating our ageing appearance, but I spent almost seven years studying
  the ageing process and self-perceptions of ageing – ironically while entering
  menopause and transitioning into midlife. What I discovered is one of the
  best-kept secrets about getting older: the contentedness that kicks in that
  allows you to give fewer fucks about many things, including your so-called
  “fading appearance”. Openly caring less is not only a good way to mow down
  those internal insecurities about growing or looking older, but it also backs
  over them again, leaving them flattened and very much in the rear-view mirror.
  That is perhaps the subtle shift from age empowerment to age liberation. In
  fact, research shows a kind of age positivity bias that continues into our
  advanced years, and apparently – from an emotional perspective – women in
  their 70s are the happiest cohort of people. In my 50s, I am enjoying caring
  less about how my appearance is perceived by society and enjoying more of
  being able to move through life with increased balance, equanimity and
  appreciation for this one precious ageing journey. • Natasha Ginnivan is a
