  Uefa will decide in September whether to approve a request by the Spanish
  football federation for Villarreal and Barcelona to contest a La Liga game in
  Miami in December. European football’s governing body is expected to discuss
  the matter at its next executive committee meeting in Tirana on 11 September
  and, should no move be made to block the request, a landmark move will edge
  closer to reality. No major league has held a domestic game on foreign
  territory, despite prolonged attempts from the Spanish top flight to do so.
  Uefa’s signoff would clear a huge section of path, although the plan also
  requires approval from Fifa, US Soccer and Concacaf. There is a broad
  acceptance within Uefa that the proposal will be difficult to reject without
  altering its statutes. Even then the plan appears to have irresistible
  momentum. Potential legal arguments against moving matches abroad have lost
  weight since the US-based promoter Relevent Sports agreed a settlement with
  Fifa in April 2024 to dismiss the global governing body from a lawsuit
  challenging its policy of barring league games from being staged in other
  countries. It means the proposal, first made by La Liga before being approved
  and submitted by the Spanish federation (RFEF), stands a high chance of being
  accepted. It is unclear whether that would be on a one-time basis or whether
  the broader principle of taking league games overseas would be agreed to. If
  Uefa decides not to obstruct the move it is likely discussions will begin
  regarding potential limits to the number of times domestic games can be held
  in other countries. Potential ideas include allowing two games a season to be
  moved as long as they are between the same teams, so that perceived home or
  away advantage is neutered. Meetings involving the various stakeholders are
  understood to have taken place on the sidelines of the draws for this season’s
  Uefa club competitions, which were held in Monte Carlo, and are expected to
  continue over the weekend. Executives from Relevent Sports, which was
  appointed Uefa’s worldwide marketing and sales partner for the period between
  2027 and 2033 this year, have been conspicuous throughout the season launch
  event on the Côte d’Azur. Any move to approve the match, which would take
  place at the Miami Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium, would sit uncomfortably within
  Uefa’s corridors of power. In an interview this week the Uefa president,
  Aleksander Ceferin, said: “I don’t think it’s a good thing.” Ceferin expressed
  unhappiness with the plan but, in line with other key figures within Uefa,
  admitted legal recourse was limited. The Italian football federation has given
  approval for a match between Milan and Como to take place in Perth, western
  Australia, in February. The reasoning provided is a venue clash with the
  opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games. The viability of that fixture
  will also enter Uefa’s thinking. On Wednesday the EU sport commissioner, Glenn
  Micallef, strongly criticised the scheme in a series of statements on social
  media. “I’m deeply disappointed by proposals to stage domestic league matches
  outside Europe,” he said. “This is the first big stress test for governance
  since the Super League. Strong, community-based clubs are the heart of the
  European Sport Model. Moving competitions abroad isn’t innovation, it’s
  betrayal.”
