  He has compared abortion access to the Holocaust and pushed conspiracy
  theories about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 2020 presidential election and
  climate crisis. Christopher Prosch is betting that Maga still rules in the US
  heartland. On Tuesday, the far-right Republican will take on Democrat Catelin
  Drey in a special general election for Iowa state senate district 1 after the
  previous incumbent, Republican Rocky De Witt, died in June. A victory for Drey
  would break Republicans’ supermajority in the state senate and deny governor
  Kim Reynolds the ability to stack agencies and courts with Maga loyalists. It
  would also give Democrats fresh hope that a blue wave is forming before next
  year’s midterm elections. State legislatures rarely gain the limelight but
  have emerged as vital power players in recent years on issues such as abortion
  rights and, this week, gerrymandering in Texas and California. They have also
  become petri dishes for the Republican party’s embrace of extremism in the age
  of Donald Trump. Prosch is founder of Felix Strategies, a public relations
  firm based in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, whose work includes “strategic
  communications for Christian conservative leaders and organizations”. He was a
  canvasser for Kristi Noem in her congressional race in 2010 and has consulted
  on numerous campaigns since. “He is deep in the Maga Trumpland,” said Heather
  Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC).
  “He is the kind of candidate that not that long ago would have never seen the
  light of day on a ballot. He said … a litany of all the Maga perspectives and
  points of view and beliefs.” Following his nomination, Prosch reportedly began
  deleting contentious posts from his social media and affiliated accounts,
  according to the Iowa Starting Line news site, which took screenshots and
  published several of them. Hosting a podcast two years ago, Prosch equated the
  Holocaust with reproductive freedom. “Who was worse?” he asked. “The Nazi
  Germans who killed 10 million Jews and many other people? Or the left’s
  policies to target an entire generation of babies to death.” He also opined
  that victims of rape or incest should carry pregnancies to term. Prosch has
  used social media to share conspiracy theories about the safety of vaccines
  and a cover-up of what caused the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York
  and Washington. He has championed the false claim that the 2020 presidential
  election was stolen by Joe Biden and, in 2022, his firm Felix Strategies
  posted a message that said: “Global cooling..global warming..climate
  change…whatever they’re calling it, it’s all a lie!” Prosch’s own website
  describes him as “a strong pro-life conservative who believes life is a
  precious gift from God that must be protected”. It also expresses support for
  Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, drive “woke” ideology
  out of schools and bar transgender athletes from school sports. The Republican
  proposes eliminating Iowa’s state income tax and “is dedicated to raising his
  children in a loving, strict Christian home”, the site says. “Christopher
  believes that leaders should be guided by the principles found in the Bible
  and the Constitution.” Prosch did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
  His opponent, Drey, is a 37-year-old marketing executive and founder of the
  group Moms for Iowa, a grassroots organisation focused on curbing gun violence
  and championing reproductive rights. She has served on local boards and
  statewide political committees and wants to increase state education funding
  in the district. Speaking from Sioux City, which is at the heart of senate
  district 1, Drey said: “The No 1 concern that folks in senate district 1 right
  now have is Iowa’s affordability crisis and I think folks across the country
  would feel that. We’ve seen policies come down from the federal level, as well
  as the state level, that are making it very difficult for people to make ends
  meet here.” Iowa’s Republican administration has made it harder for local
  municipalities to spend money to benefit their communities, Drey added, with
  middle and working classes paying more than their fair share in taxes and
  struggling to afford a house. Democrats have been soul searching since they
  lost the White House and both chambers of Congress last November. A range of
  voices from the centre and left of the party have coalesced around a focus on
  the cost of living, likely to be exacerbated by Trump’s tariffs and
  tax-and-spend legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But the
  party, whose approval rating is at a historical low, is also wrestling with an
  image problem of being seen as too elitist and out of touch. On Friday, the
  thinktank Third Way urged Democrats to stop using words such as
  “microaggression”, “safe space”, “existential threat”, “birthing person” and
  “Latinx”, which it argues make the party seem out of touch with regular
  voters. Drey said: “The biggest frustration for the working class is certainly
  feeling left behind by the ‘coastal liberal elite’ and, as much as I may
  identify with the overall policy goals of said coastal elites, I am a regular
  person who lives and works in this community. I see the way that bad policy
  affects my family and my neighbours. “If the Democrats can get back to a
  message that is, ‘We are of you and from you and we understand what it is like
  to want to strive for a beautiful life,’ then I think that is what resonates
  with people. Trying to convince folks that things are actually better when
  they’re not feeling that is tone deaf, to be quite frank. This is a party that
  can work from the bottom up in terms of shifting the balance of power and
  making life better for the folks that need it.” Drey has valuable support on
  the campaign trail from JD Scholten, an Iowa state representative who is also
  a professional baseball pitcher for a minor league team, the Sioux City
  Explorers. Art Cullen, a leading newspaper editor in Iowa, said: “He’s popular
  in Sioux City and he’s been door knocking for her.” Cullen believes that the
  election will be more of a referendum on the governor, Reynolds, than on
  Trump. “People are sick of Kim Reynolds,” he continued. “People are getting
  tired of the wackiness: banning books, making a big to-do over trans people.
  “Republicans are concentrating on all that stuff and not on, how good are our
  schools and why are our property taxes so high? The Republican-dominated
  legislature punted and went home without addressing rising property taxes.”
  Senate district 1 has a history of swinging between parties, with Democrats
  winning it in 2018 and Republicans reclaiming it in 2022. Last year, the
  district supported Donald Trump by an 11-point margin. Registered Republicans
  outnumber Democrats in the district by 38% to 31%. Republicans had a
  two-thirds supermajority in the state senate prior to the death of De Witt at
  the age of 66. If Democrats prevail on Tuesday, they would have the ability to
  block the confirmation of Reynolds’ picks for cabinet positions and judges.
  Democratic candidates have over-performed in recent state legislative
  elections, flipping Trump districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania. A third win
  would continue the momentum before next year’s midterm polls for the US House
  of Representatives and Senate. Williams of the DLCC said the party is looking
  to Tuesday to demonstrate that “Democrats can win elections – we can connect
  with voters on economic issues and they can trust us on them – and that
  Republicans are in trouble. This president’s policies and approach are deeply
  unpopular and Republicans will not be rewarded at the ballot box for it.”
