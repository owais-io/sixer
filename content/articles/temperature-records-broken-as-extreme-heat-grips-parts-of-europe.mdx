  Extreme heat is breaking temperature records across Europe, early measurements
  suggest, and driving bigger and stronger wildfires. In south-west France,
  records were broken on Monday in Angoulême, Bergerac, Bordeaux, Saint-Émilion
  and Saint-Girons. Météo France said the “often remarkable, even unprecedented,
  maximum temperatures” in the region were 12C above the norm for the last few
  decades. In Croatia, air temperature records were set in Šibenik, at 39.5C,
  and Dubrovnik, at 38.9C, while large forest fires raged along its coasts and
  ripped through neighbouring countries in the Balkans. The day before, Hungary
  broke its daily maximum temperature record when a weather station in
  Körösladány hit 39.9C. The capital, Budapest, also broke its daily maximum
  record as it sweltered through 38.7C heat. Beyond Europe, dozens of
  temperature records were broken across Canada, and record-breaking heat above
  50C in Iraq was blamed for a nationwide blackout. The heatwave in southern
  Europe comes as Nordic countries recover from unprecedented temperatures above
  30C in the Arctic Circle this month. Bob Ward, a policy director at the
  Grantham Research Institute, said: “This summer, like every summer now, has
  been exceptional in terms of extreme heat around the world.” In Italy, where
  16 of 27 major cities were placed under red heat alerts and a four-year-old
  boy died of heatstroke, and in Spain, where a man died in a wildfire after
  suffering burns on 98% of his body, the high heat did not break a large number
  of records but still rang alarm bells. “The main characteristic [of the
  heatwave] is the length and extent rather than the intensity,” said José
  Camacho, a climate scientist and spokesperson for Aemet, the Spanish weather
  agency. “But the temperatures are still very high.” In the south-west of
  France, 40% of a sample of weather stations recorded temperatures above 40C on
  Monday. Lauriane Batté, a climate scientist at Météo France, said it was too
  soon to say if records were being “shattered” rather than simply broken, but
  said the geographic extent of the heat was significant. “Unfortunately, it’s
  to be expected,” she said, adding that more than half of the 51 heatwaves in
  France since 1947 had occurred in the last 15 years. “Clearly, it’s a sign
  that the climate is warming.” The hot weather across Europe has dried out
  vegetation and allowed wildfires to spread further, in what scientists have
  described as a “molotov cocktail” of climatic conditions. EU fire scientists
  projected “extreme to very extreme conditions” across the entire continent
  this week, with “particularly severe” risks in much of southern Europe and
  high anomalies expected in parts of the Nordics. Wildfires in Europe have
  burned more than 400,000 hectares so far this year, according to data
  published on Tuesday, which is 87% more than the average for this time of year
  over the last two decades. High heat kills tens of thousands of people in
  Europe each year. Researchers estimate that dangerous temperatures in Europe
  will kill 8,000 to 80,000 more people a year by the end of the century as the
  lives lost to stronger heat outpace those saved from milder cold weather.
  Antonio Gasparrini, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp;
  Tropical Medicine, said implementing effective and diverse public health
  measures was critical as heatwaves became more frequent. “This is another
  extreme heatwave hitting Europe this summer,” he said. “As in previous events
  in the past months, we can expect not just a substantial death toll but also
  strong geographical differentials in excess mortality.” Last week, the World
  Meteorological Organization said wildfires and poor air quality were
  compounding the negative health effects of extreme heat. It noted that
  temperatures during the first week of August reached more than 42C in parts of
  west Asia, southern central Asia, most of north Africa, southern Pakistan, and
  the south-west US, with local areas exceeding 45C. “This is what climate
  change looks like,” Ward said. “And it will only get worse.”
