  Your article concludes that while foreign visitors can savour Greece’s natural
  beauty and other joys of their country, for Greeks such pleasures have become
  a bittersweet memory (‘The Thailand of Europe’: foreigners live holiday dreams
  in Greece but locals priced out, 20 August). We beg to differ, because the
  evidence points exactly to the opposite. Every year the Greek statistical
  authority, Elstat, publishes its Survey on Qualitative Characteristics of
  Resident Tourists. The July 2025 edition presents comprehensive evidence that
  Greek residents’ trips and nights spent on trips for leisure, recreation and
  holidays have been rising since 2021. Both the number of trips and the total
  number of nights spent on vacations are at their peak for the past decade. The
  overwhelming majority (more than 85%) of Greeks’ vacations take place within
  Greece, and more than 70% occur in the summer months of June, July and August.
  Further evidence demonstrating the increased ability of Greeks to take
  vacations is provided by Elstat’s annual Household Budget Survey. The latest
  edition shows that the category most closely related to vacations,
  “Restaurants, cafes and hotels”, presents the fastest rise among 12
  sub-categories of expenditure; its share in total household expenditure is the
  highest of the past 16 years, and is now higher than before the crisis. The
  numbers speak for themselves: with a remarkable economic recovery, reflected
  in rising employment and real incomes (as documented by Eurostat), Greeks are
  taking more and longer vacations, which they overwhelmingly spend in Greece. A
  number of Greeks, however, do have difficulties making ends meet, and raising
  their welfare standards is our government’s top priority. On that, we firmly
  believe we are on the right track. And the Greeks’ summer is alive and
  kicking. Omiros Tsapalos Spokesperson, Hellenic Ministry of Economy and
  Finance • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
