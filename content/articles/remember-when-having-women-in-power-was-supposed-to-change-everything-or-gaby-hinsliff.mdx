  Nicola Sturgeon was always afraid of failure. But it was a very particular
  kind of failure she feared; one that follows a very particular kind of
  success. Living up to the fact of being Scotland’s first female first minister
  became, she writes in her new memoir, “almost an obsession”, which is arguably
  unhealthy but not unreasonable. To be the first woman (or indeed the first
  minority) in any field is to be uncomfortably aware of being on probation: the
  test case that sceptics will use to decide whether women in general can really
  hack it, but also the yardstick by which other women will judge whether
  representation actually makes a difference. You daren’t betray anything that
  looks like a sign of weakness, yet at the same time you’re endlessly under
  pressure to spill your guts on all the intimate stuff – miscarriage and
  menopause in Sturgeon’s case, pregnancy in high office for New Zealand’s
  Jacinda Ardern, also the author of a recent memoir – lest other women feel
  you’re either holding out on useful information, making it all look too
  infuriatingly easy, or failing to do your bit to break some taboo. (Even
  Sturgeon, in an interview this week with the midlife women’s podcast The
  Shift, expressed surprise that, when she was figuring out how to manage
  menopausal symptoms in office, she couldn’t find anything to read about how
  other senior politicians had coped.) Suddenly, you’re not just a woman but an
  everywoman, supposed to magically embody every female voter who ever existed,
  even on issues where women in real life are impossibly divided – as they were
  over trans rights, the issue that ultimately holed Sturgeon’s premiership
  below the waterline. Representation can be a blessing and curse, even for a
  politician as gifted as Sturgeon undoubtedly has been. But is it also
  ultimately a distraction? Her book completes a trio of recent memoirs,
  alongside those of Ardern and Germany’s Angela Merkel, which feel like a final
  full stop on the end of an era in which putting a woman in power was expected
  somehow to change everything. All three at their peak were somewhat
  romantically held aloft as examples of a kinder, more emotionally literate
  politics: Merkel for opening her arms to Syrian refugees; Ardern for the
  unifying way she led her country through the immediate and potentially
  divisive aftermath of the Christchurch terrorist massacre; and Sturgeon for
  being the remain voter’s feminist yin to Boris Johnson’s laddish Brexiter
  yang. All three functioned at times as queens across the water for English
  leftwingers, wondering wistfully why they couldn’t have a leader like that.
  During the 2015 televised election debates in which Sturgeon took part,
  viewers furiously Googled whether it was possible to vote SNP south of the
  border. Merkel’s principled pushback against Donald Trump in his first
  presidency – remember that iconic image of her looming commandingly over a
  seated Trump at a G7 summit? – was as much admired and envied in parts of the
  UK as Ardern’s “zero Covid strategy” of sealing borders, at least until the
  latter was overwhelmed by new variants. Yet all three became bitterly
  polarising figures in time, as Sturgeon herself acknowledged to The Shift’s
  Sam Baker. The nature of the tribe in charge might have changed, but not the
  angry tribalism endemic in politics: so much for the patronising Barbieworld
  fantasy that if women ran the world, peace and love would rule the day. With
  hindsight, though, what all three of those pioneer female leaders really
  represented was a longing for someone to break the mould, and that hasn’t gone
  away. If anything, the impatience and frustration with mainstream politics
  building up in younger women suggests it is intensifying. The Scottish
  journalist Alex Massie wrote this week of the English tendency to idolise
  Sturgeon from a distance, even as Scots who experienced her government’s
  failings up close were losing patience with it. As an English journalist, I
  have to concede some truth in that. From a distance, it’s too easy to get hung
  up on the performance of leadership, at which she genuinely did excel, and
  forget about what it actually feels like to be governed by someone day in and
  day out. During the pandemic, I remember envying the way Scottish lockdown
  restrictions took into account children’s need for play, but more broadly the
  thought and seriousness that seemed to be going into Sturgeon’s policymaking
  when Johnson was still making jokes about squashing sombreros or turning a
  blind eye to drunken parties. Yet death rates in Scotland weren’t noticeably
  better than in England, for reasons the Covid inquiry is still exploring.
  Meanwhile, in New Zealand, Ardern was failing to hit her much-vaunted targets
  on child poverty, a reminder that personal values don’t necessarily trump the
  realities of a post-lockdown economy. The obvious moral to be drawn from all
  of this is that putting women on a pedestal simply because they’re women makes
  no more sense than taking lumps out of them for the same reason: that in a
  mature democracy, they would be judged simply on results. Since the least
  interesting thing about Kemi Badenoch’s increasingly erratic leadership of the
  Conservative party is her gender, perhaps it’s not too much to hope that we’re
  moving in that direction: that the joy of being the third or fourth or fifth
  woman through the door is that eventually people simply cease to care. But, if
  so, it will be the Sturgeons and the Arderns and the Merkels, with all their
  flaws, who paved the way. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Do you have an
