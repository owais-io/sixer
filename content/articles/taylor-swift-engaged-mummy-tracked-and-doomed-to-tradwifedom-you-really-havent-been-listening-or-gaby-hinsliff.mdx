  Taylor Swift is off the market. She’s engaged to marry the NFL player Travis
  Kelce in what will be the US’s first proper royal wedding, and yes of course I
  know you’re far too high-minded to care about any of that, but what’s striking
  is how many people seem convinced that this is the end of any kind of
  interesting life for her. As if a woman had no drama, no edge, no stories to
  tell, and – let’s be frank, here – no commercial value to speak of once she is
  no longer at least theoretically sexually available. The fairytale ends when
  the princess marries the prince: who cares, really, what happens to her after
  that? Music critics are already gloomily debating whether marriage will kill
  her creativity, or whether she’ll be left for dust by one of the younger
  rivals already nipping at her heels if she does take time out from music to
  have the children she’s always said she wanted. Poor Taylor, mummy-tracked
  before she’s even pregnant, like an old friend of mine whose engagement in her
  20s prompted her male boss to tell everyone in the pub afterwards that that
  was her out for the count. He meant that she’d presumably have babies now and
  lose her professional edge – right on the first count, very wrong on the
  second – but also perhaps that she had somehow put herself in a different
  category: no longer young and promising, but practically matronly overnight.
  Even the Today programme devoted breakfast airtime to pondering where Swift
  will get her material, once she’s a smug married with no toxic exes to write
  about – though of course she was never just about breakup songs, and women
  have been known to have interesting interior lives even over the age of 35.
  More gallingly, in the US the Maga right is crowing about what they see as
  Swift’s surrender to the forces of conservatism, as if the patron saint of
  childless cat ladies (and arch-defender of reproductive rights) had just sold
  out in return for a rose-bedecked engagement photoshoot and the coy note of
  small-town romance struck by her line that “Your English teacher and your gym
  teacher are getting married”. So when people ask what on earth she has to
  write about now, the obvious answer for someone who has made billions from pop
  songs about redefining women’s limits and subverting expectations is … all of
  the above. All the lazy assumptions about what it means to be a wife and
  (maybe, eventually) mother, including the astonishingly persistent old
  chestnut that feminism isn’t compatible with loving a man. All the questions
  and internal contradictions that plenty of her original fanbase – who, like
  her, are now in their mid-30s and faintly mortified to find themselves getting
  into bread-making – must be secretly wrestling with too. There is an
  incredibly rich lyrical seam just waiting to be mined about being a millennial
  woman and wanting perfectly ordinary things – love, security, a family –
  without feeling as if you’re compromising your independence, losing the career
  you’ve worked so hard for, or subconsciously shrinking yourself to fit some
  narrowly pre-ordained mould. This week, England and Wales reported that
  fertility rates had fallen to their lowest level since comparable data was
  first recorded in 1938, when Britain was on the eve of a war. In Scotland,
  they have plummeted even further, to the lowest point seen since records began
  in 1855. The causes of this modern collapse are complex, ranging from the
  astronomical cost of childcare and the struggle to afford a family-size home
  to the hellscape that is dating apps, and much more besides. But lurking
  somewhere in the mix is the fact that what’s on offer just doesn’t seem all
  that compelling to many younger women. Tradwifedom, the meekly old-fashioned
  vision of domesticity served up on Instagram by a bunch of submissive
  influencers in aprons, is a gingham-lined trap visible from space (and even
  for those who do buy into the retro housewife fantasy, it’s out of reach for
  all but the tiny minority of couples who can afford to live on only one
  salary). Burning out in an attempt to do everything at once, like some of
  their mothers did, is not much more appealing, however. Meanwhile, some are
  already falling into the yawning gap between the solution they’d hoped for –
  men prepared to share the domestic load like equals – and the often jarring
  reality of early motherhood. Now imagine all those conflicting emotions,
  boiled down into a few unforgettable one-liners by the woman who also wrote
  the soundtrack to your single years. It’s true that in literary terms, the
  transition between questing singleton and married woman is a tricky plot
  point. Bridget Jones’s creator Helen Fielding didn’t seem to know what to do
  with her once she’d married her Mr Darcy, and ended up killing him off to make
  Bridget interesting again. The writers of And Just Like That encountered the
  same problem when Carrie Bradshaw eventually married Big, and solved it
  equally murderously. But both Carrie and Bridget are fictional characters. No
  matter how heavily curated her public persona, somewhere deep inside the
  Taylor Swift industrial complex is a real human being, and assuming that she
  can’t spin gold out of this says more about narrow views of what women can be
  as they get older than it does about an endlessly inventive myth-maker. The
  old Taylor may not, in her words, be able to come to the phone right now. But
  I suspect there will be a new one along any minute. Gaby Hinsliff is a
