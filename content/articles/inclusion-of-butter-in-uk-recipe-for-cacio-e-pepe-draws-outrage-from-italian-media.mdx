  One of the UK’s most popular food websites has cooked up a storm in Italy
  after allegedly botching a recipe for the traditional Roman pasta dish, cacio
  e pepe, drawing diplomatic representations from the main trade association for
  Italian restaurateurs. A recipe on Good Food, formerly owned by the BBC, which
  continues to licence the web address bbcgoodfood.com – described cacio e pepe,
  a culinary institution in the Italian capital, as a “store cupboard favourite”
  that could easily be whipped up for “a speedy lunch” using “four simple
  ingredients – spaghetti, pepper, parmesan and butter”. The notion that making
  cacio e pepe is easy was bad enough, but the presence of parmesan cheese and
  butter has been deemed a cardinal sin. Traditional cacio e pepe contains three
  ingredients: pasta (usually tonnarelli, a type of spaghetti), pecorino Romano
  cheese and black pepper. Such is the fury, Fiepet Confesercenti, an
  association that represents restaurants in Italy, said it would demand a
  correction from the website in order to “safeguard this iconic dish”.
  Furthermore, it has taken up the issue with the British embassy in Rome. The
  recipe appears to have been on the site for about three months, but despite a
  couple of readers calling out the butter blunder, it only now seems to have
  caught the attention of Fiepet Confesercenti, which was also offended by the
  brief preparation video that runs alongside it showing a chunk of butter being
  put into a pan. Claudio Pica, the president of the Rome unit for Fiepet
  Confesercenti, said the association was “astonished” to see the recipe on such
  a popular and esteemed food site, adding that letters have been sent to
  Immediate Media, the site’s owner, and the British ambassador to Rome, Edward
  Llewellyn. “This iconic dish, traditionally from Rome and the Lazio region,
  has been a staple of Italian cuisine for years, so much so it has been
  replicated even beyond Italy’s borders,” he added. “We regret to contradict
  the historic and authoritative British media, but the original recipe for
  cacio e pepe excludes parmesan and butter. There are not four ingredients, but
  three: pasta, pepper and pecorino.” Pica admitted that while some chefs may
  dabble with the recipe, the main concern is that the website has misled
  readers by presenting the dish as the original. The Guardian has asked
  Immediate Media for comment. Italian newspapers have had a field day over the
  controversy, with the Rome-based Il Messaggero writing: “Paraphrasing the
  famous British anthem ‘God save the king’, Rome restaurateurs are now saying:
  ‘God save the cacio e pepe”.” The Guardian’s 2021 recipe for the dish by the
  food writer Felicity Cloake comprises just pasta, pepper and pecorino. It is
  not the first time the foreign media has become embroiled in an Italian food
  row. In 2021, the New York Times published a tinkered-with recipe for another
  classic Roman pasta dish, carbonara, which included tomatoes. While the
  description of the recipe, called “smoky tomato carbonara” and created by Kay
  Chun, did warn readers that it was not the original, Coldiretti, the Italian
  farmers’ association, lashed out, saying the alteration was “the tip of the
  iceberg in the falsification of traditional Italian dishes”. Given that Chun’s
  recipe was again published in 2023, it appears the newspaper was unperturbed
  by the indignation. Italians often mock foreigners for their interpretation of
  an Italian recipe, especially pineapple on pizza or mixing pasta with chicken.
  The New York Times also provoked outrage in the UK in 2018 after publishing a
  recipe in which it described the yorkshire pudding, a roast dinner staple, as
  a “large, fluffy pancake” that was excellent for “breakfast, brunch, lunch and
  dessert any time of the year”.
