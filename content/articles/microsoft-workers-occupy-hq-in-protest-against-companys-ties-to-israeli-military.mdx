  Dozens of Microsoft employees occupied the company’s east campus in Redmond,
  Washington to protest against what they say is the use of its software by the
  Israeli military to carry out operations in Gaza and enable the surveillance
  of Palestinians. Less than a week after the company said it was launching an
  independent investigation into the use of its Azure software, current and
  former staff occupied a space they declared the “Free Zone”, holding placards
  that read “Join The Worker Intifada – No Labor for Genocide” and “Martyred
  Palestinian Children’s Plaza”. The protests, organised by the No Azure for
  Genocide group, has demanded Microsoft divest from Israel. Earlier this year,
  employee Joe Lopez interrupted a speech by CEO Satya Nadella at the annual
  developer conference. “Satya, how about you show how Microsoft is killing
  Palestinians,” said Lopez. Demonstrator Hossam Nasr said on Tuesday they had
  decided to escalate their actions because there had been no adequate response
  from Microsoft. He felt personally motivated to speak out more vigorously
  after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out the targeted killing of the
  high-profile Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, one of five members of the
  media who was killed earlier this month in the operation. “I watched him
  report on Gaza relentlessly, through starvation, through extermination
  campaigns, through bombing. He was the voice of the business. He was
  intentionally targeted,” said Nasr, 26, who worked for Microsoft for three
  years but was fired last year after organising a vigil for Palestine outside
  the company’s offices. “It happened the same week news came out from the
  Guardian that Microsoft is storing mass surveillance data collected from calls
  from Palestinians.” Earlier this month, the Guardian, Israeli-Palestinian
  publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, revealed
  Israel’s military surveillance agency, Unit 8200, was making use of Azure to
  store countless recordings of mobile phone calls made by Palestinians living
  in the West Bank and Gaza. The company said it was not aware “of the
  surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using
  Microsoft’s services”. The protest at Microsoft comes against the backdrop of
  increased warnings from organisations such as the UN about “widespread
  starvation, malnutrition and disease” in Gaza. The Gaza health ministry has
  estimated at least 62,000 Palestinians have been killed since the IDF launched
  its operations in the aftermath of Hamas’s 7 October attacks. Nasreen Jaradat,
  29, a Microsoft employee, said: “Every single second that we wait, things are
  worse and worse in Palestine.” She added: “People are getting hungrier and
  hungrier. More and more people are being bombed and maimed. It’s time for us
  to escalate, however we can.” The protest ended after about two hours when
  police told the demonstrators to leave and said they would be arrested for
  trespassing. A Microsoft spokesperson said the group of demonstrators “was
  asked to leave, and they left”. The spokesperson said it had nothing to add to
  a statement made last week about an inquiry it had undertaken into allegations
  Azure was being used to surveil Palestinians. “Based on these reviews,
  including interviewing dozens of employees and assessing documents, we have
  found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been
  used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza,” it said. Microsoft
  employs as many as 47,000 people at Redmond. While some took the flyers handed
  out on Tuesday by the activists and read them, others continued to tuck into
  their lunches in the restaurants that surrounded the square. One 28-year-old
  employee who was watching the protests said he sympathised with the
  demonstrators but did not think they would have much impact. “I don’t think it
  will,” said the man, who asked not to be named. The demonstrators say their
  efforts are part of a process to educate people. “I think we are inspiring
  conversation among the people who work at Microsoft to feel more comfortable
  talking about this with each other and about how their work is contributing to
  genocide,” said another employee, Julius Shan, 28. People are still learning
  how the company is linked to genocide, he said. “But that’s the nature of
  learning new information.”
