  Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. I’m writing from Bridgetown, Barbados,
  where I’ve spent the past week participating in Crop Over festival. I’ll take
  you through some reflections on my first experience of the Caribbean. Peeling
  back Barbados’s orange economy When I looked up the hotel I’ll be staying in
  before leaving London, one of the first things I noticed is that the gallery
  is largely made up of white tourists. It’s no surprise – Barbados is heavily
  reliant on tourism, which contributes nearly one-third of GDP to the economy.
  And during the northern hemisphere’s colder months, the numbers jump higher.
  This winter tourism often conjures up a particular image of middle-class
  couples and families seeking sun, enjoying the resorts, cruises and rum
  punches but, perhaps, more detached from the local culture. But that is a
  limited image the country is evidently keen to expand, as I learned when I
  finally arrived. As Andrea Franklin, the chief executive of Barbados Tourism
  Marketing Inc (BTMI), a division of the government’s tourism affairs, tells me
  that “in the past, the Caribbean was viewed as sun, sand and sea”. Now there
  is a greater impetus “to recognise who we are as a people – and to promote the
  culture, the heritage, our food, our music”. Crop Over, which takes place
  during the quieter rainy season, presents an opportunity to focus on promoting
  cultural heritage. Franklin says this has helped strengthen the orange
  economy: the wider contribution of creative and cultural assets, and so
  Barbados focuses on promoting its musicians, artists and chefs. *** The
  Mottley effect In part, this reshaping of the island’s image can be attributed
  to the influence of its prime minister, Mia Mottley. She is the most prominent
  Caribbean leader outside of the region, having made headlines for her radical
  climate policies, taking on the IMF, calls for reparative justice and for
  transforming Barbados into a republic by severing ties with the British crown.
  These bold moves are helping the island shed its “Little England” reputation,
  a nickname derived from Bajans’ supposedly English affectations and love of
  cricket, which had been a particular appeal for some tourists. Under Mottley’s
  leadership, Barbados has also developed ambitions to become the first
  carbon-neutral island state. Its sustainable and regenerative tourism strategy
  is central to this – and encourages visitors to become involved in
  community-driven initiatives, as opposed to just sipping piña coladas on the
  beach. The idea is that this contributes towards tackling poverty through job
  creation and upskilling, providing opportunities for Bajans to earn an income
  from tourism beyond hospitality roles. Mottley’s perceived radicalism has, in
  fact, boosted interest in Barbados, as has the global megastar Rihanna.
  Franklin says: “Because [Mottley’s] viewed so highly worldwide, it serves us
  well as a destination, because people want to see where this woman is coming
  from, what’s happening on the island.” While positive, you do wonder about the
  sustainability of a country’s prominence hinging on a politician (especially
  one who is rumoured to be eyeing the top job at the UN in 2027), and though
  Rihanna’s cultural cachet is likely to endure, I wonder how Barbados intends
  to maintain this momentum in prominence when Mottley eventually steps down.
  *** My pick of the Crop This visit is my first time in the Caribbean, and
  while I had been familiar with aspects of the culture through the UK’s large
  diaspora, my time in Barbados was an incredibly thrilling education in its
  heritage and history. Crop Over, originally called Harvest Home, has its roots
  in the 17th century, as enslaved people throughout the archipelago marked the
  end of the yearly harvest, making it one of the oldest festivals in the
  western hemisphere. It is now a multiweek cultural event running through July
  and August, featuring fetes, arts, food and spectacle – culminating in Grand
  Kadooment, a street carnival attracting 15,000 masqueraders on the first
  Monday of August that is a parade of colourful feathers, sequins, jewels and
  endless soca. The celebrations coincide with Emancipation Day, commemorated
  across the Caribbean on 1 August, to mark the anniversary of the abolition of
  slavery, and a reminder of the history and pain that underpin the region. Over
  the week, I’ve made the most of the cultural feast from fire-breathing demos,
  stilt-walking classes and T-shirt cutting to a history lesson on the Tuk band,
  a Barbadian musical ensemble described as a meeting of west African percussive
  culture and the colonial regimental bands of the British military. What
  particularly thrilled me was seeing how much these celebrations were a meeting
  of the Black diaspora. I met fellow Brits and visitors from the US, Canada as
  well as other Caricom states. Despite the difficulties of travelling between
  Caribbean islands, I came across Jamaicans, Bahamians, Trinbagonians and St
  Lucians. Some who, like me, were visiting for the first time, were on a
  mission to experience different festival and carnival events across the region
  and to strengthen their understanding of their sister cultures. Undoubtedly my
  highlight is Foreday Morning Jam, also known as J’ouvert elsewhere in the
  Caribbean, a parade in the early hours of the morning in which revellers throw
  powder and paint over each other while dancing in procession behind a truck
  blaring soca bangers. Two things I learn are that Jordan English’s track
  Darkers is the unofficial anthem of this Crop Over season, and that even
  thousands of miles from home I can’t escape the viral Jet2Holiday “song of the
  summer”, which gets a ridiculous – but frankly delightful – soca reworking.
  But mostly I am struck by just how free I feel. It is almost cliche to say
  that dancing in the street is a liberating experience but, as someone who,
  admittedly, can be uptight, the parade completely unravelled me and released
  me from all inhibitions. It drove home that this was not simply a party but a
  collective spiritual experience – nourishment for the soul. It is so far away
  from the image of pristine beaches and cruises yet feels like the real face of
  Barbados. *** The path of progress There is one aspect of these celebrations
  that feels like a meeting of Barbados’s progressive image, who they want to be
  as a country, and what putting its people front and centre means in practice:
  the status of its queer community. In 2022, the high court struck down
  colonial-era buggery laws, and Mottley has made clear her intolerance to
  homophobic discrimination. Luke Lascaris, a queer researcher who has worked
  with the National Cultural Foundation as a Crop Over ambassador, tells me that
  in the Caribbean Barbados is seen as a “city on the hill”. The striking down
  of the buggery law was considered by many as “a pivotal moment. People also
  believe that becoming a republic in 2021 ushered in a whole set of new rights
  and a lot more equity and equal representation for all people in society.” It
  is not that such progress is in service of tourism, but inevitably this will
  do much to attract a different kind of visitor – younger and more progressive,
  with a revamped image of openness. Barbados has evidently done much to
  distance itself from its standing in 2019, when the island was ranked by
  Forbes as the eighth most dangerous destination for LGBTQ+ travellers. (I must
  say, I have long disliked these lists for how they oversimplify the context of
  travel, and their ignorance to how queer people have long navigated their
  countries of heritage – I have been gay clubbing in Nigeria, after all.)
  Barbados hosted its first Pride march in 2018 and it has continued annually
  since. Lascaris tells me that the event “started out as a lot of expats and
  people from overseas but more and more locals have become involved”. However,
  it is not only in Pride that queer Barbadians are making themselves visible –
  with this strategy to promote Barbados’s people, there is a clear demand from
  the queer population to be included. “There’s been a very large push for queer
  rights, so that queer people feel seen and heard and not pushed constantly to
  the shadows,” Lascaris says. “Queerness is a part of our identity as Caribbean
  people. The national motto of Barbados is ‘pride and industry’, so why
  shouldn’t we be proud of who we are?” Lascaris is clear that Barbados has some
  way to go in terms of changing social attitudes. However, so long as the
  government leads – particularly on recognising same-sex civil unions and
  following up on a promised referendum on marriage – the people will follow,
  despite their conservatism. “Barbadians will accept what the status quo is and
  follow along with it, and a lot of people don’t believe there would be
  homophobic backlash to that,” he says. At Foreday Morning, I felt some of that
  tension: the in-reach and yet frustrating distance between what the country is
  and what it could be. While dancing with other revellers, I had an encounter
  with a beautiful Caribbean man who made clear his interest in me. We did not
  quite dance together but rather sprayed each other’s bodies with paint in a
  way that was more tense and erotic than any dancefloor kiss I’ve had in
  London. When I looked around, I noticed other same-sex intimacies between men
  and between women, and I’d heard many stories about queer encounters at
  festivals and carnivals across the region. And so while centring culture is
  evidently a success story for Barbados, it is not one that is only about
  industry and economy, but something charting a society that feels on course to
  true liberation. This trip was provided by Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc. To
