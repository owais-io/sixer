  Theatre feels like the perfect home for the wild and poetic Grief is the Thing
  With Feathers, Max Porter’s slim book – a cross between a novella and a tone
  poem. The book lives in the space between reality and imagination where, after
  the death of his wife, a Ted Hughes scholar and his two young sons are visited
  by a giant talking crow. This is a space that theatre, with its suspension of
  disbelief and gestural staging and imagery (where a box can become a chair, a
  bed, or a mountain), inherently understands. We make our feelings into symbols
  and stories so we can process them, and we’ve been doing it for centuries on
  stage. Porter’s book, published in 2015, has been adapted for live performance
  at least seven times (with more in the pipeline). This year, it’s Belvoir’s
  turn to take the man, his boys, and their crow and show an audience how
  digging into the guts of feeling can cut a path through. It’s a team that’s no
  stranger to ghosts, the gothic, or theatricalising literature. The co-adapters
  are director Simon Phillips (Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour’s Phantom of the
  Opera) and lighting designer Nick Schlieper (Sydney Theatre Company’s
  Dracula), who both co-designed the set, and Toby Schmitz (Netflix’s Boy
  Swallows Universe), who plays Dad and Crow. Onstage in a corner is Freya
  Schack-Arnott, the show’s composer, playing a mournful cello that seems to
  haunt Dad specifically. Sound designer Daniel Herten conjures a murmur of
  fluttering wings whenever Schmitz slips on his leather jacket to become Crow,
  playing with unseen presences. It’s a straightforward production, largely
  following the book’s triptych of short prose poems in the alternating
  perspectives of Dad, Boys (played here by adult actors Philip Lynch and Fraser
  Morrison) and Crow. When Dad has the floor, we stay grounded in realism – he
  grapples with raw emotions and haunting memories alongside the day-to-day of
  loss, somehow putting one foot in front of the other when his life is
  shattered. He worries about his sons; he becomes “odd”. He conjures this
  feathered analyst-cum-babysitter-cum-trickster from his research into Hughes’
  1970 poem cycle Crow – or perhaps Crow tastes the family’s grief and flies
  from poetry to their side. Either option feels – as it does in the book –
  surreal but strangely correct. Inhabiting the lost Dad, Schmitz makes a great
  effort to access tenderness and let his language be lovely; it’s
  part-performance, part-oration. It doesn’t always work but Porter’s words have
  power – throughout the show, there is a constant audience murmur of sniffles
  and sobs. As Crow, Schmitz finds more avian postures – such as a tilt of the
  head, delivering his spray of his words like pokes from a beak. Schlieper’s
  moody lights seem to bend around Crow; he casts shadows that are, depending on
  the scene, a threat or an embrace. Flitting around the edges of the stage
  before swooping to its centre in a rush of energy are the Boys (in beautiful
  performances – Lynch is remarkably poignant as the youngest child), whose
  stories shift from accounts of childhood adventures to tales of mythic
  metaphor, as they try to reassemble themselves and grow up into their changed
  world. There is great permission in this production, as in the book, for each
  audience member to give grief the shape and space it needs, and on opening
  night as people near me wept, and as rain hammered down on the roof, it was
  almost transporting: we almost fell into Crow’s world. But this is a
  straightforward adaptation, in script and staging, and that keeps us grounded
  in our own world. Phillips and Schlieper have constructed a world of black and
  grey: stones at the door, feathers that fall through the air and coat the
  space. It’s all backdropped by animated illustrations (by Jon Weber, with
  video design by Craig Wilkinson), also predominantly in black and greys. These
  illustrations literalise the scenes: there’s the metaphoric forest in which
  the boys confront an aspect of their grief; there’s Crow, watching; there’s a
  flashback scene. There’s something flattened and lost in this approach: by
  taking the book’s sacred imaginative space – where a reader, spurred to new
  ideas, conjures up their own images – and turning it into something literal,
  the production feels too prescriptive, too safe. It’s a missed opportunity: in
  the theatre, a blank black box can light up brains and unlock stores of wonder
  as we build new realities; here, we’re directed to see everything, even Crow,
  the exact same way. For some, this will work. For others, it could feel like
  being held at arm’s length from the mess and guts the book invited us to drown
  in until we could climb our way out. Grief is the Thing With Feathers is at
  Belvoir St Theatre, Sydney, until 24 August
