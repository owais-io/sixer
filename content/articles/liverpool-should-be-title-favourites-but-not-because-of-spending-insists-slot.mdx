  Arne Slot has conceded Liverpool can be considered favourites for the Premier
  League title but played down the impact of their spending and said a summer of
  upheaval had created some uncertainty over his team’s prospects. The head
  coach accepts Liverpool will carry the mantle of favourites into the new
  campaign having won a 20th league championship by a comfortable margin last
  season. Liverpool, who face the FA Cup winners, Crystal Palace, in the
  Community Shield on Sunday, have since invested almost £300m on new talent and
  want to add the Newcastle striker Alexander Isak. No Premier League club has
  spent more than Liverpool but the champions will have recouped almost £200m
  should Darwin Núñez complete his move to Al-Hilal. The portrayal of Liverpool
  as lavish spenders, insists Slot, is misleading. “The net spend of us compared
  to the other teams is not in our favour if you look at the last two seasons,”
  he said. “It’s completely normal that we are one of the favourites, because we
  won it last season. And we brought in good players. Like all the other teams
  did, by the way. This is what makes this league so nice. I think there’s only
  been one exception [a team winning the league after a frugal summer] in the
  last two, three, four, five, six years, and that’s Liverpool last season.
  “Every team in the Premier League is spending money. So if we are only
  favourites because we’ve spent a bit, I would see that as weird because we’ve
  lost a lot as well. But that we are favourites because we won it last season
  and we played so well, that’s clear. And the ambitions haven’t changed,
  because the ambition of this club is always to compete for every trophy.” Slot
  believes it is premature to say Liverpool’s squad represents an upgrade on
  last season and says the departures of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Díaz –
  as well as the tragic loss of Diogo Jota – cannot be ignored. “The players
  we’ve brought in have done really well already, as expected,” he said. “But I
  cannot tell you now if these players are able to perform at the same level
  every three days; we first have to start the season. And I did know Luis Díaz
  was able to do that, and all the other ones were able to do that. So that is
  another challenge in the Premier League, because we play so many games. “For
  Milos Kerkez, it’s going to be his first time at this level probably that he
  might have to play every three days. Florian Wirtz comes from the Bundesliga,
  where he was used to playing every three or four days, but we have to ask him
  in two months if the intensity levels of the Premier League are comparable
  with the Bundesliga. “In terms of talent and the quality we’ve brought in, we
  see that we have a very good team again. But we have to wait and see. Will
  they stay fit? The ones that have left were almost fit for the whole season.
  Will all the ones that we brought in do the same? There are multiple factors
  you need to take into account. I am really happy with the players we’ve
  brought in but we’ve also lost starters that had a big impact on our
  title-winning season last year.”
