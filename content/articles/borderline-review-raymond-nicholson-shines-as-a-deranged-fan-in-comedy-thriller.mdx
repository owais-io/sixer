  Borderline review – Raymond Nicholson shines as a deranged fan in comedy
  thriller

  Paul Duerson (Raymond Nicholson) has got it bad for world famous pop star and
  actor Sofia (Samara Weaving). It being the 1990s, he doesn’t have the option
  of simply being creepy on social media; instead, he takes her hostage and
  attempts to marry her, as you do, in a period-comedy-horror-thriller that is
  entertaining enough moment-to-moment, but doesn’t add up anything very
  substantial overall. Standing in the way of Paul’s deranged scheme is
  bodyguard Bell (a grounded and nicely judged performance by Eric Dane), and
  rounding out the men in Sofia’s life is her NBA player boyfriend Rhodes
  (Jimmie Fails). Screenwriter Jimmy Warden knows a grabby real-life premise
  when he sees one. In 1985, a bear ate a massive amount of cocaine and fatally
  overdosed, leading, in 2023, to the release of the Warden-scripted movie
  Cocaine Bear. In 1996, Robert Dewey Hoskins was sentenced to 10 years in
  prison for stalking Madonna, providing the loose inspiration for this latest
  Warden script, which this time out he has also directed (casting his wife
  Weaving in the lead role). Warden is not a bad director of individual scenes,
  with several sequences playing out like miniature music videos, complete with
  big bold needle-drop choices on the soundtrack. The problem is the overall
  cohesion, or rather, lack of it – there are plenty of cool ideas, and a
  narrative that strings them together effectively enough, but it’s unclear what
  we’re meant to feel about any of it. Are we supposed to be ironically amused,
  in a Tarantino-esque emotionally detached way? Or are we supposed to be
  invested in Sofia as a horror heroine we hope will be able to defeat her
  captor? Is Paul an antihero in the Rupert Pupkin vein, or a
  straight-down-the-line killer, or some kind of nice guy underneath it all,
  with serious mental problems? The screenplay isn’t nuanced enough to switch
  between modes in a way that feels intentional and the result is the sense that
  there are a few different films jostling for attention. Still, it’s all pretty
  stylishly done, and if you’re thinking Nicholson is a dead ringer for a young
  Jack Nicholson, we can save you a Google: he’s his son, and doing a nice line
  in the kind of derangement his dad channelled so memorably in the The Shining.
  • Borderline is on digital platforms from 8 September.
