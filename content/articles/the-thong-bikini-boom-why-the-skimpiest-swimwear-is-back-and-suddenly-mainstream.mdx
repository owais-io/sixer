  The thong bikini boom: why the skimpiest swimwear is back – and suddenly
  mainstream

  There are plenty of places where no one would bat an eyelid at the sight of a
  thong bikini; on a beach in Brazil or around the Love Island fire pit, visible
  butt cheeks are practically de rigueur. But my first sighting this year was
  not while surfing in Australia or sunbathing in the Caribbean, but at an
  open-water swimming spot, on a rainy day in Scotland. I should not have been
  surprised. Tiny swimwear is huge news this summer. It is no longer confined to
  sunny climes, but cropping up everywhere from lidos to leisure centres – and
  lochs, apparently. The trickle down from catwalks and influencers to
  holidaymakers and shoppers is notable. A search for “thong bikini” on Asos
  yields 187 results, ranging from high-leg styles, to side-tie, to tanga
  (somewhere between a thong and a standard brief), while high-street outlets
  including H&amp;M, Calzedonia and Zara all have thong bikini bottoms in their
  collections. And, as with any trend, there are plenty of celebrity
  forerunners, including gymnast Simone Biles, model Heidi Klum, actor Sofía
  Vergara and singer Nicole Scherzinger. Rapper Lizzo is a longtime fan. “I
  won’t lie, it was nerve-racking initially,” says Victoria, 29, who wore a
  thong bikini for the first time on a recent solo trip to Naples. As for many
  new converts, part of the appeal lay in the fact that she would be able to
  avoid the significant tan lines created by fuller coverage swimwear. “I saw
  thong bikinis everywhere and wished I could wear one. But then I thought about
  it and was like, it’s just a bum. Men wear those teeny-tiny trunks where you
  see everything, so why can’t I wear this? Plus, it was really comfy.” The
  itsy-bitsy bikini revolution may have come to the fore this summer, but it has
  been rumbling for some time. In 2023, the New York Times declared that “more
  women are adopting the ‘less is more’ philosophy” when it comes to beachwear;
  the same year, fashion site Who What Wear called thong bikinis the
  “controversial swimwear trend you’ll see on every beach this summer”. In 2024,
  New Zealand site The Spinoff asked: “Why is every bikini bottom a thong now?”
  “I think we’ve moved into another age of body consciousness – a much more
  expressive moment,” says Shaun Cole, associate professor in fashion at the
  University of Southampton. “People are saying: ‘It’s my body and I can show it
  off in ways that I choose to, and if that involves wearing clothing that is
  sometimes deemed socially unacceptable then I’m going to do that.’” Gen Z, in
  particular, are less inclined to restrict themselves to clothes deemed to be
  “flattering” – a term that has fallen spectacularly out of favour. Thong
  bikinis, once the preserve of those who conformed to a particular body type,
  are now being manufactured in a more inclusive range of sizes and marketed
  more diversely. “Women of all shapes and sizes are leaning into bolder cuts
  with real confidence as part of a wider cultural shift towards body positivity
  and self-expression, which is great to see,” says Aliya Wilkinson, founder of
  luxury swimwear label Ôsalé. Her brand doesn’t yet offer thong styles, but she
  plans to introduce them in the future. “In the west, fashion has long found
  ways to augment the butt, to make it look bigger and put emphasis on this part
  of the female body,” says Roberta Sassatelli, professor of sociology at the
  University of Bologna and co-author of Body and Gender. “This is perhaps
  because the butt is deemed to be very sensual but is not related to
  reproduction. Because it is totally related to pleasure, it feels more
  liberated.” The trend is reflected in the popularity of potentially dangerous
  cosmetic procedures, such as Brazilian butt lifts. Sculpting the perfect
  behind has also become something of a fitness obsession. In 2018, sports
  writer Anna Kessel noted that “the emphasis on a firm, or ‘juicy’, bottom has
  now overtaken the flat stomach as the fitness holy grail in mainstream women’s
  health magazines”, with an increasing number of gym classes dedicated
  exclusively to the posterior. Seven years later, could it be that gym-goers
  are keen to display the results? “I think the popularity of thong bikinis
  exists at the convergence of a focus on building glutes in the gym, a kind of
  exhibitionist creep in which the butt is one of the last frontiers that had
  remained mostly covered in public, and a greater cultural acceptance of a
  range of different body types,” says historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela,
  author of Fit Nation. “The low-slung jeans of the early 2000s were certainly
  correlated with the age when flat abs workouts were all the rage.” Cole
  suggests there may be another reason why more people are choosing to wear
  less. “It could be linked to what’s been called the ‘pornification’ of culture
  and style,” he says, citing an idea put forward by fashion historian Pamela
  Church Gibson. “[It is] modelled on a style that has come out of pornography –
  at the points where pornography stars are dressed – which involves garments
  such as tiny bikinis or thong-style underwear. There’s an acceptance of that
  style without people really realising where it originated. The popularity of
  shows such as Love Island, where people are there to show off their bodies as
  a way of attracting a partner, again ties to that pornification of style.”
  After years of falling audience figures, Love Island is also experiencing a
  boom this summer: increased numbers tuned in to watch the UK and US versions,
  with the New York Times attributing the popularity of the latter to its
  ability to offer reprieve during “times of societal and economic hardship”. As
  dress and design historian Amber Butchart put it when curating Splash!, a
  recent exhibition on swimming and style at the Design Museum in London:
  “Swimwear’s close relationship with the body means it reflects changing
  attitudes to modesty, morality and public display. From the 18th century,
  bathing machines were used to protect sea dippers from prying eyes. But
  throughout the 20th century, a number of boundary-pushing designs challenged
  previous ideas of decency while also courting controversy. For the last
  century, what we wear while swimming has been used as an excuse to police
  bodies.” While it is predominantly women who are opting for poolside thongs
  today, this wasn’t always the case. The earliest iteration of the style is
  thought to be the ancient loincloth, worn by men. Modern thongs are said to
  have been adopted in 1939, when the mayor of New York, Fiorello La Guardia,
  ordered that showgirls must cover themselves rather than perform nude at the
  city’s World’s Fair. When it comes to swimwear specifically, Austrian-American
  Rudi Gernreich – the fashion designer behind the monokini, or “topless bikini”
  – is most often credited with creating the thong bikini, in response to Los
  Angeles city council banning public nudity, including naked sunbathing, in
  1974. The thong bikini has prompted similar bans more recently. In January, a
  council in Greater Sydney, Australia, banned thong and (even skimpier)
  G-string bikinis at its public pools. A number of women have also been
  arrested for wearing thong bikinis in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where the
  style is banned. In the UK, Greenwich Leisure Ltd, which operates 240 leisure
  centres under the brand Better, requires swimmers to wear “full-coverage
  bikinis”, which a spokesperson previously indicated did imply “that thongs
  wouldn’t be acceptable”. But even when thong styles are not prohibited, many
  bikini-wearers remain nervous. “I do own one, but it’s only been worn once,
  when my partner and I had a private villa in Portugal,” says Rebecca, 33. Even
  then, she says, she felt a little too exposed. “I don’t understand why someone
  would wear one on a family holiday, for example. Thong bikinis feel quite
  sexualised, so to me it seems inappropriate. Give me high-waisted bikini
  bottoms that cover your cheeks any day.” For Sassatelli, the reason thong
  bikinis are in vogue is not so surprising. “The thong has never gone away
  completely,” she says. “But for people who are in their teens and 20s, they
  haven’t really been ‘in fashion’. Once [the fashion industry] has forgotten
  something, then it can be recuperated – and it makes for a little sense of
  novelty.”
