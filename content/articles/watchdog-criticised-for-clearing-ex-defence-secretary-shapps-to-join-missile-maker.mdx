  The watchdog that monitors government ministers’ professional appointments
  after leaving office has been criticised for clearing Grant Shapps, a former
  Conservative defence secretary, to join Cambridge Aerospace as long as he
  promises not to work on defence matters. In a ruling that drew scorn from
  political ethics experts, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments
  (Acoba), which monitors and advises on the revolving door between Westminster
  and the business sector, gave Shapps the green light to become the chair of
  defence company Cambridge Aerospace. Shapps told Acoba that the company,
  founded three months after the Conservatives’ general election defeat last
  year, planned to “develop technologies to reduce risks to aviation”.
  Disclosures show he cited examples such as airport delays caused by drones.
  Acoba, which is due to be scrapped amid allegations that it is “toothless”,
  agreed he could take up the position, providing “strategic direction and high
  level advice”, on condition that he did not work on matters related to
  defence. Acoba appeared to accept Shapps’s description of Cambridge
  Aerospace’s activities, saying the company’s work “focuses on civilian
  aerospace”, meaning there was no direct overlap with the former defence
  minister’s access to sensitive information. The Labour MP Phil Brickell said
  this explanation was “stretching credulity” given Cambridge Aerospace’s own
  public statements and backers. The company, which has attracted around $100m
  (£73.9m) in funding, outlined its plans in a presentation to investors, first
  reported by The Upstart and subsequently obtained by the Guardian. Slides in
  the presentation describe Cambridge Aerospace as a “defence tech” company and
  refer to the need to prepare for a “new era of warfare”. Speaking to Bloomberg
  last month, Prof Steven Barrett, Cambridge Aerospace’s co-founder and a
  longtime acquaintance of Shapps, said the company had “one mission”. This was
  “to protect the UK and our allies from the well-known threats we face from the
  skies”. The company’s first product, labelled Skyhammer, aims to intercept
  drones and cruise missiles, leading to comparisons with Israel’s Iron Dome
  missile defence system. The technology is understood to have been initially
  intended to counter drones and could expand to include defence against threats
  including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. The firm is planning to operate
  from an engineering site in Munich and a manufacturing hub in the Polish city
  of Gdansk. Barrett’s co-founder, Chris Sylvan, previously worked for Anduril,
  a California-based defence company that is developing what Sylvan appears to
  have described as “robot fighter jets” in a post on the professional social
  networking platform LinkedIn. The post is no longer available. Shapps served
  as defence secretary between August 2023 and July 2024, a tenure that falls
  within the two-year grace period during which former ministers must apply to
  Acoba if they want to take up private sector roles. The system is designed to
  ensure that ministers and their new employers do not benefit unfairly from
  information or contacts garnered from their time in government. Acoba can only
  advise on appointments but, in practice, has no power to block them, unlike
  its equivalent body in France, which can veto appointments. In its advice to
  Shapps, Acoba said the risk of a conflict of interest was “limited”. “Whilst
  you will have had oversight of a wide range of information on policy,
  operations and matters generally affecting defence, there is no direct overlap
  with your access to sensitive information as this work focuses on civilian
  aerospace,” it said. Earlier this year, Keir Starmer pledged to replace Acoba,
  which was described as “toothless” in a 2017 report, with a tougher system of
  checks and balances to monitor ministers’ private earnings after leaving
  office. Brickell said Acoba’s advice to Shapps was “yet another example” of
  why Labour was getting rid of Acoba. “It’s weak, has no teeth and doesn’t have
  the powers to prevent conflicts of interest from arising,” he said. “Grant
  Shapps seems to be saying one thing about what he’ll be doing, while his
  company is saying another. It is stretching credulity to breaking point. The
  authorities clearly need to look at this again, and Shapps should resign from
  this post if he can’t provide satisfactory answers.” A spokesperson for the
  campaign group Transparency International said: “Oversight of this revolving
  door rests on little more than gentlemen’s agreements, with no means in
  practice of enforcing the business appointment rules. “It will just invite
  abuse until the rules governing former ministers entering the private sector
  are tightened, and properly enforced.” Shapps said: “I joined Cambridge
  Aerospace because I have always believed in the importance of protecting our
  civilian airspace – a belief only strengthened by witnessing the devastation
  caused by Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. “As the company has grown, so too
  have the threats facing our nation. Our mission is to develop technology that
  can save lives, strengthen UK and allied security, and create highly skilled
  British jobs. I’m proud to be a founding partner in a business dedicated to
  those goals.” A spokesperson for Acoba pointed to the advice it had given
  Shapps not to engage in defence matters for two years. “The committee also
  took into account that as a qualified pilot since 1995, Mr Shapps had a
  long-term interest in aviation, unrelated to his time in ministerial office,”
  they added. Barrett said: “In the less than a year since Cambridge Aerospace
  was formed, we have developed a range of products, hired nearly 60 people into
  highly skilled engineering roles, and continue to invest significantly in full
  domestic manufacturing. “As we have seen in Ukraine, the need to protect
  against a range of threats from the air, targeted at anything from
  infrastructure to civilian populations is only increasing. I am incredibly
  proud of the work our team has done to provide a low-cost solution that can
  provide vital defensive capabilities to these threats facing Europe and our
  allies.”
