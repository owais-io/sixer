  Germany does not expect Russian attacks on Nato territory under the cover of
  Moscow’s Zapad military drills which are set to kick off in two weeks, German
  chief of defence Carsten Breuer said, reported by Reuters. “We don’t have any
  indication that preparations for an attack are taken under the cover of the
  exercise. But we will be on our guard, not just the German forces, but Nato,”
  Breuer told reporters in Berlin. The commission was also asked about von der
  Leyen’s FT interview on plans for Ukraine, with journalists doubting if the
  plans were as advanced as she made them sound (10:24). Arianna Podestà said
  that commission representatives “participate in these technical level talks,”
  and von der Leyen remains in contact with other leaders. “Therefore, it is the
  view of the president formed through the information that she gets in
  discussion with the leaders, as well as technical level engagements, that
  there is a plan that is coming to shape. There is a clear roadmap, as she has
  said, towards building these security guarantees. She has said that, for
  example, in last week’s meeting of the Coalition of the Willing and defence
  chiefs, they have worked out a pretty precise plan for this engagement.” EU
  transport spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen also offered a bit more detail on
  the issue of GPS jamming and its impact on operations. She said: “Generally,
  we have been seeing a quite a lot of such jamming and spoofing activities,
  notably in the eastern flank of Europe. Europe is the most concerned region in
  the or most affected region globally, on this. There was a letter sent by 13
  member states to the Commission in June this year, and they drew our attention
  additionally to this issue, which is something that is becoming almost daily
  practice. It has serious impacts on maritime and aviation and obviously with
  economic impact as well.” European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podestà has
  now confirmed that von der Leyen’s plane was affected by “GPS jamming,” with
  the Bulgarian authorities suspecting this was “due to blatant interference
  from Russia.” “We are, of course, aware and used to somehow to the threats and
  intimidations that are [a] regular component of Russia’s hostile behaviour. Of
  course, this will only reinforce even further our unshakable commitment to
  ramp up defence capabilities and support for Ukraine.” She stressed that the
  plane landed safely in Bulgaria. “This incident actually underlines the
  urgency of the mission that the President is carrying out in the frontline
  member states.” Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha has just said that an
  extraordinary meeting of the Nato-Ukraine council will be held in Brussels
  today “at the request of Ukraine and in response to Russia’s recent massive
  air attacks”. “We anticipate a focused discussion on joint steps to adequately
  respond to Russia’s rejection of peace efforts and escalating terror against
  Ukrainians. We are grateful to Nato and all allies who continue to show strong
  support for Ukraine and meaningful peace efforts. Moscow must feel a stronger
  pressure as the consequence of it prolonging the war.” In the last few
  minutes, the FT also reported that a suspected Russian interference attack
  targeted von der Leyen’s plan on approach to Bulgaria over the weekend,
  forcing the plane to land using paper maps. The newspaper quoted (£) an
  official saying that “the whole airport area GPS went dark,” prompting the
  pilot to circle over the Plovdiv airport for an hour and eventually land using
  paper maps. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. The
  so-called GPS jamming, which is believed to be caused by Russia, has been a
  recurring problem affecting parts of eastern Europe, particularly over the
  Baltic Sea, in the last few years. In 2024, a similar incident involved an RAF
  plane taking the then defence secretary Grant Shapps back to UK from Poland,
  and flying near the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Mobile phones could no
  longer connect to the internet and the aircraft was forced to use alternative
  methods to determine its location, the source said. Meanwhile, we received a
  readout from the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s meeting with
  Russia’s Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghain Cooperation
  Organisation summit in China. Erdoğan’s office said that he told Putin that
  Ankara was working to find a fair and lasting end to the war in Ukraine and
  that talks between the parties in Istanbul were contributing to peace efforts,
  Reuters reported. The pair also talked about bilateral relations, peace
  efforts between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the situation in the Middle East.
  Lithuania’s Nausėda also speaks about the country’s plans to use more EU
  funding to strenghten its border and defence lines after incidents with
  suspected Russian drones crossing into Lithuania in recent months. “Lithuania
  understands the situation now is very dangerous, very fragile, and we have to
  be able to detect the UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles] which are crossing from
  time to time over border, and we should be able to shoot them down if needed.
  So this is about safety of our people, and we take this very seriously.” And
  that ends their press conference. Appearing alongside Lithuanian president
  Gitanas Nausėda, the EU’s von der Leyen is now speaking about the EU’s plans
  for supporting the countries on the bloc’s eastern border. She says that EU
  member states with a direct border with Russia and Belarus “will receive
  additional funding,” as “it is in the European interest that we have the
  protection of the border here.” Von der Leyen also speaks about the potential
  security guarantees for Ukraine. She says the EU was working on security
  guarantees together with the Coalition of the Willing, with “a strong,
  well-equipped and experienced” Ukrainian army set to be the first line of
  defence, supported by “a multinational group from the Coalition of the Willing
  with the backstop of the Americans.” The former German defence minister adds
  that this will be supported by the EU’s “own defence posture.” She also says
  that a potential EU membership for Ukraine would also effectively offer
  another guarantee. That appears to confirm what she said in the FT interview.
  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is touring the bloc’s seven
  countries on the eastern border with Russia, talking about preparedness and
  plans to invest in European defence industry. She will be in Lithuania and
  Romania later today, after visiting Latvia, Finland, Estonia, Poland and
  Bulgaria over the weekend. But in an interview with the Financial Times
  newspaper (£) published this morning, she said that European capital were
  working on “pretty precise plans” for potential military deployment to Ukraine
  to provide security guarantees, and argued there was a “clear road map” for
  such deployments. She said capitals were working on plans for “a multinational
  troop [deployment] and the backstop of the Americans”. Let’s see if she goes
  further in her comments later today. And as if on cue, we are now getting
  reports that Zelenskyy will meet with European leaders in Paris on Thursday to
  discuss the next steps and what can be done to raise pressure on Russia, a
  source told AFP. “We’re planning such a meeting” between Zelensky and
  “European leaders”, the source said, adding that Trump “is not so far expected
  to be there.” More than two weeks on from the Alaska summit between US
  president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin, the end of the
  war in Ukraine does not appear to be any closer. Trump claimed at the time
  that he was close to a breakthrough that could lead to a bilateral meeting
  between Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But that does not seem to be
  any closer either. Zelenskyy said last week that Ukraine would “remind
  everyone about it” as Trump’s semi-deadline of “two, maybe three weeks”
  symbolically expires today. On Friday, French president Emmanuel Macron warned
  that if Putin missed the Monday deadline, it would be yet another example of
  him trying to ‘play’ Trump – something that, Macron said, could not go
  unanswered and should prompt further sanctions. But attending a summit in
  China over the weekend, the Russian president repeated his hardline position,
  reiterating his opposition to Ukraine’s plans to join Nato and calling for “a
  fair balance in the security sphere,” which is widely seen as shorthand for
  his expansive demands on Europe’s security. “In order for a Ukrainian
  settlement to be sustainable and long-term, the root causes of the crisis,
  which I have just mentioned and which I have repeatedly mentioned before, must
  be eliminated,” Putin said. Meanwhile, Ukraine said it suspected Russian
  involvement in the murder of former parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy over
  the weekend. “We know that this crime was not accidental. There is a Russian
  involvement. Everyone will be held accountable before the law,” police chief
  Ivan Vyhivskyi said on Facebook, Reuters reported. It all suggests another
  busy week, as leaders try to find new ways forward. I will bring you all the
  key updates here. It’s Monday, 1 September 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and
  this is Europe Live. Good morning.
