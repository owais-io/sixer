  Passion by David Morley (Carcanet, £12.99) David Morley’s ardent, vividly
  alive latest collection draws on his Romany background and knowledge as an
  ecologist and naturalist. The poems weave the dynamism of the Romany language
  with English to celebrate our intimacy with the natural world’s vast mystery
  and beauty: “from elm top to hedgerow … from harebell to whitethroat: / Sorí
  simensar sí men, / Sorí simensar sí men.” (We are all one.) This evocative
  braid of language is also used to consider the aching cruelty of oppression –
  “The gavvers kettle the Travellers on the market square. / The locals stand by
  gawking, piss-taking” – as well as the defiant, quicksilver power of Romany
  language and community. “Nouns grew spry and spring-heeled /… words which
  Travellers / might ride, or hide behind from hard law /… But spoken language
  moves / like meltwater under ice. Speech thaws into life.” Versus Versus: 100
  Poems by Deaf, Disabled &amp; Neurodivergent Poets, edited by Rachael Boast
  (Bloodaxe, £14.99) This anthology is a dizzying, continent-crossing explosion
  of verse, its topics and styles as individual as the poets; revelling in the
  diversity of a community that is often boxed in by ableism and prejudice. A
  potent theme of resisting limits courses through the book. Lateef McLeod’s
  poem pushes back against others’ definitions: “I am too pretty for your Ugly
  Laws, / too smooth to be shut in”, while Mishka Hoosen’s work celebrates the
  power and agency of those who think and live differently: “I am that howl / in
  the night ward. I am electric / without your help.” In a period in the UK when
  disabled people’s rights and living conditions are under threat, this
  collection feels timely. As Maya Abu-Hayyat suggests: “They will fall in the
  end, / those who say you can’t.” So What by Frederick Seidel (Faber, £12.99)
  So What energetically decries the spectre of death and the grinding
  indignities of illness and age facing the 89-year-old poet, while skewering
  the failures of the American empire and the west more widely. In the brilliant
  title poem, set in Claridge’s, the speaker describes a gilded bubble of
  privilege in a world of atrocity: “The marble shines like syrup. / So what
  they whip the marble with a riding crop / To keep the lava from Vesuvius away
  from us / And keep Pompeii plush and posh.” Seidel remains the toweringly
  enigmatic, ludic and at times offensive provocateur, yet his lyric abilities
  with image and line never lose their power: “My breath steamed up, / A foghorn
  of silence inflaming the air.” So when he writes, “Poetry is meaningless. /
  Poetry is a disgrace on a warm spring day”, it feels that, for all his
  effervescent bile, we should only half believe him. In the Hollow of the Wave
  by Nina Mingya Powles (Nine Arches, £11.99) This luminous second collection is
  interested in the power of material creativity in all its forms, both within
  visual art and within the rich, often overlooked realms of fashion, textiles
  and fabric. The poet speaks of the subtle potency of clothing to shape the
  self and to chart memory, celebrating her Chinese-Malaysian heritage while
  rejecting others’ ignorance: “a gown can map a white orientalist’s dreamscape
  / a gown can trace the outline of a field from one’s childhood”. The book also
  deftly engages with the uneasy beauty of nature during a time of ecological
  crisis, drawing on her upbringing in Aotearoa New Zealand to create vividly
  unsettling images of a changing world. “It is both beautiful / and terrible /
  to understand the colours of a pacific coastal wildfire / wet lupine creamy
  aster drenched rhododendron crinkled / into pearly flame.” Transfigurations:
  Collected Poems by Jay Wright (Penguin Classics, £14.99) Finally, British
  readers can get to grips with a profoundly original, ambitious and globally
  minded writer. Wright’s lyrical, experimental verse traverses world traditions
  and beliefs, mining the heritage of his African ancestry alongside the
  influence of an upbringing in the American southwest, a fulcrum of American,
  Spanish and Navajo cultures. The poems offer a deep engagement with spiritual
  knowledge and myth: “I see the God himself dance/ and turn about himself/ like
  the stars he moves…” They also explore the vigour of ritual, and how it might
  lead to personal and communal transformation: “in the order of these acts, / I
  take your presence upon me. /…I have been trying to create a language/ to
  return what you have lost /… a language to return you to yourself.” Despite
  their variety, these dazzling, questing poems are always seeking to discover
  how a collective selfhood and identity might come into being.
