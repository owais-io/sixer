  It feels symptomatic of English cricket’s dysfunctional nature that, having
  started the summer with five different options for a restructured County
  Championship, the 18 first-class chairs will conclude a tortuous process next
  week with a sixth on the table. International peace treaties have been
  negotiated quicker than talks over whether, and how, to cut a handful of
  playing days from a domestic calendar that, with four different competitions
  and formats to accommodate, is bursting at the seams. The tongue-in-cheek
  words of the England and Wales Cricket Board’s managing director of the
  professional game, Rob Andrew, when announcing the review in April have proved
  prophetic. “We have 18 counties that agree it’s not right, but 19 different
  versions of what the answer is,” he said. Unlike the previous attempt to
  remodel the English summer three years ago that was commissioned by the ECB
  and led by Andrew Strauss, the current review has been undertaken by the
  counties themselves under the aegis of the Professional Game Committee [PGC],
  chaired by Warwickshire’s Mark McCafferty. Consequently, the emphasis has been
  on a widespread consultation that has resulted in seemingly ever-changing
  plans. The Strauss Review had a clear, single recommendation for the
  Championship: to be split into three divisions of six with a reduction from 14
  to 10 matches in each. This, however, was comprehensively rejected by the
  counties. What is the plan? After a long summer, the most radical proposals
  have been dismissed, including three conferences of six, a single 18-team
  league with a Champions-League Swiss model fixture list, a mid-season split
  similar to that of the Scottish Premier League and several different variants
  of the current 10/8 divisional makeup. It has left two options on the table.
  At a meeting at Lord’s next Tuesday the 18 county chairs will be asked to
  choose between keeping the status quo – 10 teams in Division One and eight in
  Division Two each playing 14 matches – or adopting a new structure that
  involves a 12-team County Championship being split into two pools of six, with
  the remaining six clubs in a second tier beneath this. A vote will follow the
  meeting later next week if the PGC judge there is a realistic prospect of it
  being passed, which is not guaranteed. With 12 votes required to alter the
  structure, Surrey, Lancashire, Middlesex, Essex and Somerset have already
  stated they will oppose any reduction to the current 14-game season, with the
  voting intentions of Derbyshire, Sussex and Kent in the balance. The 10 other
  counties – an unlikely alliance of Test match grounds and Division Two sides
  such as Leicestershire and Northamptonshire – are broadly in favour but need
  two other clubs to come on side. “A small number of chairs have worked very
  hard to deliver the best solution for the game,” one advocate of the new
  structure told the Guardian. “It would be a real shame if this opportunity is
  missed.” How would it work in practice? The selling point of the final
  compromise is the fact 14 of the 18 teams would play 13 matches each summer
  due to a series of September playoffs, on top of a 12-game regular season. The
  Championship would consist of each team playing 10 games home and away against
  the five opponents in their pool, plus two additional matches against sides in
  the other pool determined by seeding. At the end of the season, all the
  Championship teams would play a 13th game against the corresponding side in
  the other pool – first v first, second v second etc. While these matches were
  initially billed as playoffs for the title and wooden spoon, it is now
  envisaged that they would each be worth the standard 24 points and added to
  those in the regular season to determine final league positions. As a result,
  it is theoretically possible that the top-of-the-table clash could prove
  meaningless, if one of the sides has 24 points more than their opponent after
  12 matches. Although this feels unsatisfactory to some and would remove the
  spectacle of a grand final at Lord’s, the proposed new structure would
  guarantee jeopardy at the wrong end of the top tier, with the bottom sides in
  each pool relegated. The winners of the second tier – Championship 2,
  consisting of 10 home-and-away games plus two additional loop fixtures – would
  be promoted automatically, with second facing third in a playoff for the right
  to join them in the top flight. Key stumbling block The refuseniks are chiefly
  acting out the wishes of their vocal but relatively small memberships.
  Totalling about 70,000, of which Surrey contribute by far the most at just
  over 20,000, they vociferously oppose any reduction in championship matches.
  The influence of this lobby group is a huge source of frustration to the
  Professional Cricketers’ Association, whose members want a cut in cricket on
  the grounds of player welfare and quality. In a last-minute attempt to win
  over floating voters the PGC is understood to have offered to add an extra
  fixture in the 50-over One Day Cup from next season to appease members and
  provide additional gate receipts, a proposal which will form part of the
  Championship vote.
