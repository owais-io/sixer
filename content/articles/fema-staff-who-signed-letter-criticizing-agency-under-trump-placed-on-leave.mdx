  Trump’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has placed some agency
  staff on leave after their signing of a public letter of dissent this week.
  Among those facing potential retaliation are staff who were directly
  responsible for relief efforts in Kerr county, Texas, which is still reeling
  from the deadly floods it faced last month, according to Stand Up for Science,
  the advocacy group that published the Monday letter. “This situation is
  developing, but this decision underscores the many issues these public
  servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for
  Americans in need,” said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson. More than 180
  current and former Fema employees signed the letter sent to the Fema Review
  Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and
  programs, and warning that Fema’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was
  dangerously diminished. Thirty-six signed their names while 141 signed
  anonymously for fear of retribution. Some reports say that up to 30
  signatories have been placed on leave. Though Stand Up for Science could not
  confirm that number, “it seems likely they’ve retaliated against all public
  signers”, a spokesperson said. “Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted
  their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the Fema 36,” the person added. The
  Associated Press confirmed that at least two of the signatories received
  notices on Tuesday evening informing them they would be placed on leave
  indefinitely, with pay, and that they must still check in every morning
  confirming their availability. The status of other signatories was unclear.
  The notice said the decision “is not a disciplinary action and is not intended
  to be punitive”. Fema did not respond immediately to questions about how many
  staff members received the notice and whether it was related to the letter.
  The Washington Post first reported that some Fema employees were being put on
  leave. Called the “Katrina Declaration” by signers, the letter references the
  much-criticized Fema response to Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf
  coast 20 years ago this week. Jeremy Edwards, former spokesperson for Fema and
  the White House under Joe Biden’s presidency, who signed the letter, said the
  agency had been “completely unprepared for Katrina because of where they were
  positioned within the federal government at the time”. He said the Trump
  administration was failing to comply with the 2006 Post Katrina Emergency
  Response Act (PKEMRA) passed to prevent future botched disaster responses. “As
  an example, PKEMRA required Fema to be led by someone with disaster management
  experience. This administration failed that test,” he said. “It requires that
  the secretary of homeland security not reduce the capacity or ability of the
  agency. They failed that test. And it requires them to provide training and
  preparedness measures for state and local partners, and they’ve rolled back a
  lot of those trainings, or put them on pause.” The dissent letter contained
  six “statements of opposition” to current policies at Fema, including an
  expenditure approval policy by which the homeland security secretary, Kristi
  Noem, must approve contracts exceeding $100,000, which the signatories said
  reduces Fema’s ability to perform its mission. It also critiqued the
  Department of Homeland Security’s decision to reassign some Fema employees to
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the failure to appoint a qualified
  Fema administrator as stipulated by law, and cuts to mitigation programs,
  preparedness training and the Fema workforce. Edwards said the Trump
  administration could immediately appoint a new acting Fema administrator with
  more disaster management experience, and end new policies requiring Noem to
  sign off on agency spending. But at least one anonymous current staffer was
  skeptical of the letter’s ability to deliver change. “I appreciate where their
  heart is but not a lot of upside for folks who work here to sign on to
  something like that,” the anonymous staffer said. In an email on Monday, a
  Fema spokesperson said: “It is not surprising that some of the same
  bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to
  reform. “Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the
  status quo, who have forgotten that their duty is to the American people not
  entrenched bureaucracy.” The statement was “an insult to anyone working at
  Fema, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing
  circumstances”, said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson. The letter follows
  reports that the Department of Homeland Security, Fema’s parent agency, has
  administered lie detector tests in response to leaks about how the agency is
  being run. “There is a huge culture of fear and intimidation that the
  secretary of homeland security has imposed upon the agency, and that David
  Richardson [Fema’s acting administrator] is also imposing,” said Edwards. He
  said he had known people who were “unceremoniously fired on the spot” after
  failing polygraph tests. “They refute the results, mind you, and these aren’t
  legitimate exercises, but they were walked out of the building,” he said. “The
  fact that the people who signed on to this letter saw all that happening, knew
  that that very same thing could happen to them, and they still took the risk
  because they thought it was important to put their name on this thing, I think
  speaks to an immense amount of courage on behalf of these people.” Stand Up
  for Science was also behind an earlier letter of dissent from current and
  former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staff, over which about 140 EPA
  staff members were placed on administrative leave.
