  Historian Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab
  studies at Columbia University, has cancelled plans to teach this fall in
  response to the school’s recent agreement with the Trump administration.
  Khalidi made the announcement in an open letter to Columbia’s acting president
  published in the Guardian on Friday. “Although I have retired, I was scheduled
  to teach a large lecture course on this topic in the fall as a ‘special
  lecturer’ but I cannot do so under the conditions Columbia has accepted by
  capitulating to the Trump administration in June,” Khalidi wrote. Columbia
  announced last week that it would pay more than $200m in a settlement with the
  federal government after the White House claimed the university failed to
  adequately address alleged antisemitism on campus amid protests over the
  Israel-Gaza war, and threatened to pull significant funding. The Trump
  administration has accused several major US academic institutions of failing
  to tamp down on antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests and sought to cut
  millions of dollars in support if the schools fail to submit to the
  government’s demands. Columbia, which was the site of major protests over the
  war in Gaza, has served as a test case in the administration’s efforts to gain
  greater control over higher education in the US. Under the deal, which will be
  overseen by an independent monitor that will report to the government, the
  university has agreed to expand its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies
  and review its Middle East curriculum. It also pledged to cut programs
  promoting “unlawful efforts” related to diversity. Along with the $200m,
  Columbia will pay $21m to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over
  alleged civil rights violations of Jewish employees. The agreement has drawn
  criticism from faculty, students and alumni who argue it amounts to
  capitulation that will have have significant repercussions for academic
  freedom, hamper the university’s independence and restrict pro-Palestinian
  speech. In his open letter, Khalidi, who retired last year after teaching at
  the university for more than 20 years, fiercely criticized the agreement.
  Columbia chose to adopt a definition of antisemitism that “conflates
  Jewishness with Israel, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description
  of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews”, Khalidi said. The
  definition makes it impossible to teach honestly about the creation of Israel
  or the genocide in Gaza perpetrated by Israel, he wrote. The deal will
  infringe upon faculty members’ academic freedom and speech, as well as that of
  teaching assistants and students, Khalidi said, who will be forced to
  constrain their speech in order to evade “the fearsome apparatus that Columbia
  has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged
  discrimination – which at this moment in history almost invariably amounts
  simply to opposition to this genocide”. Agreeing to submit the syllabuses and
  scholarship of prominent academics for review by outside actors is “abhorrent”
  he added. He concluded: “Columbia’s capitulation has turned a university that
  was once a site of free inquiry and learning into a shadow of its former self,
  an anti-university, a place of fear and loathing, where faculty and students
  are told from on high what they can say and teach, under penalty of severe
  sanctions.”
