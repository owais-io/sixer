  Ministers have been accused of undermining innovation in the north of England
  after six universities from the south were awarded £10m to hire overseas
  talent – with none selected between Birmingham and Glasgow. Twelve
  universities across Britain have been handed a share of the government’s £54m
  global talent fund, which Labour said would “put rocket boosters” under its
  innovation plans. The money is intended to attract top international academics
  and was awarded to three “golden triangle” universities – Oxford, Cambridge
  and Imperial College London – and others including three from the south of
  England. MPs and researchers said it was “deeply disappointing” that no
  universities in the north of England were chosen, given their strong research
  record and the government’s stated aim to rebalance the UK economy. Chi
  Onwurah, the Labour chair of the Commons science, innovation and technology
  committee, said she was demanding an explanation from the science minister,
  Patrick Vallance. She said: “I’m writing to Lord Vallance for further details
  on how the government selected the 12 institutions that will receive funding,
  and why no region north of Birmingham was prioritised. “The process he set out
  in his response to me is neither evidence-based policy nor place-based policy,
  nor even policy-based evidence, but some kind of mishmash which does not stand
  up to scientific scrutiny. “This funding decision seems to be at odds with the
  government’s stated mission to boost opportunities in every part of the
  country, and I hope the minister will be able to provide clarity.” The global
  talent fund was administered by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), an
  arm’s-length government body. The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a
  thinktank, said the criteria for selecting the universities was “arbitrary and
  inconsistently applied” and unfairly overlooked large institutions such as
  Manchester, Durham, and York. It obtained UKRI’s selection criteria under the
  Freedom of Information Act and found that seven northern universities met a
  key threshold of spending at least £5m on international research funding.
  These were Manchester, Leeds, York, Newcastle, Lancaster, Sheffield and
  Durham. It said many of these institutions were unfairly disadvantaged by two
  further criteria related to their proportion of overseas staff. Larger
  universities are less likely to meet the 35% quota of international staff
  given their size, it said, although the University of Manchester missed out by
  just 0.3%. Henri Murison, the chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse
  Partnership, said it welcomed the principle behind the fund but it “undermines
  innovation in the north”. “The north isn’t pleading, it’s simply asking not to
  be overlooked in favour of special treatment for nations like Wales, which,
  while important, are far smaller in scale,” he said. “The north remains the
  UK’s only credible economic counterweight to London and the greater
  south-east. If the government is serious about delivering growth across every
  part of the country, it cannot allow UKRI, the intermediary between government
  and our world-class research councils, to stand in the way of that ambition.”
  A government spokesperson said: “The £54m global talent fund will help some of
  our leading universities and research institutions to attract top researchers
  and their teams to the UK. Institutions across all four nations of the UK were
  selected based on measurable criteria. “We are determined to maximise the
  opportunities in every part of the country, including the north of England,
  through our regional growth strategy, by building more cross-national research
  partnerships, and by investing our record £22.6bn funding for R&amp;D through
  schemes like the local innovation partnerships fund.” As well as the “golden
  triangle” three, the institutions selected are Queen’s University Belfast, the
  universities of Bath, Birmingham, Cardiff, Southampton, Strathclyde and
  Warwick, the John Innes Centre in Norwich and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular
  Biology in Cambridge.
