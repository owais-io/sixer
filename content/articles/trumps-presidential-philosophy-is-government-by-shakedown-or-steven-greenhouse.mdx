  Americans have long glorified their constitution and the rule of law. But
  Donald Trump’s volatile and vindictive presidency has increasingly replaced
  that philosophy with something very different – call it “governing by
  shakedown”. Trump has often violated federal law, and sometimes the
  constitution, as he has sought to throttle his targets – whether universities,
  law firms or US trading partners – in the hope that they will cry uncle and
  agree to his demands. This style of governance would make any caudillo proud.
  But it should make anyone who cares about the rule of law – and avoiding
  authoritarian rule – very worried. By threatening to cripple this university’s
  finances or that country’s exports, Trump has become the global emperor of
  shakedowns. It has been great for him and his ego. He dominates negotiations
  and news cycles, and his White House cheerleaders rush to proclaim victory
  whenever he reaches a deal with one of his targets. Claiming that many
  universities haven’t done enough to combat antisemitism, Trump has demanded
  that Harvard, Columbia, Brown and other schools submit to his rightwing
  vision. Furious that some law firms have hired people or filed lawsuits he
  didn’t like, Trump has taken unprecedented steps to attack them unless they
  submitted to his demands. Trump has wreaked havoc on global diplomacy and
  supply chains by threatening America’s trading partners with stratospherically
  high tariffs unless they reached trade deals with Washington. Far too many
  Americans – whether senators, the media or the public – fail to realize that
  Trump’s attacks on these institutions evidently violate the law. Federal
  district courts have ruled in four cases that Trump’s broadsides against law
  firms violate their free speech rights. The US court of international trade
  ruled that Trump’s across-the-board tariffs against dozens of countries were
  illegal, concluding that Congress hadn’t given him “unbounded authority” to
  slap tariffs on nearly every country. (The administration is appealing that
  ruling.) As for Trump cutting off billions in aid and research grants to
  universities because of their alleged failures in responding to antisemitism,
  many legal experts say his administration has plainly failed to comply with
  anti-discrimination laws that require the government to follow specific
  procedures before penalizing universities, such as giving schools an
  opportunity for a hearing. Moreover, federal law says the government can halt
  funding to only particular university programs where noncompliance has been
  found, and not, for instance, to scientific research far afield from that.
  Last week, Trump expanded his shakedown efforts. He told the chipmaker Nvidia
  that he would let it sell high-end AI computer chips to China only if it paid
  15% of the revenue from those sales to the US treasury. Nvidia agreed, even
  though Trump’s demand was of dubious legality; the constitution prohibits the
  government from placing a tax on exports. Trump also threatened Brazil with a
  50% tariff unless it stopped prosecuting its rightwing former president, Jair
  Bolsonaro, for allegedly seeking to overturn Brazil’s presidential election.
  When Brazil’s current president rejected that demand, saying that Trump
  shouldn’t be telling a sovereign democracy how to run its justice system,
  Trump imposed the 50% tariff. Trump’s move is an outrage because he’s seeking
  to strong-arm a longtime US ally over how to run its justice system and
  because, as Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said, this is “far outside his legal
  authority”. Many lawyers voiced shock and dismay when the law firm Paul,
  Weiss, a litigation powerhouse, reached a deal with Trump instead of fighting
  him. Paul, Weiss promised to provide Trump with $40m in pro bono legal
  services after he sought to cripple the firm by suspending its security
  clearances and barring its lawyers from federal buildings. All told, nine law
  firms have reached deals with Trump, promising nearly $1bn in pro bono
  services . Some legal experts call these deals illegal – one Yale law
  professor said “a contract that you make with a gun to your head is not a
  contract”. Columbia has reached a $221m settlement with the Trump
  administration, while Brown reached a $50m deal. While denying any liability,
  Columbia vowed to “work on multiple fronts to combat” antisemitism and other
  “forms of hatred and intolerance at Columbia”. The university also pledged not
  to use “race, color, sex, or national origin” in hiring decisions and said its
  admissions policies would be merit-based and wouldn’t “unlawfully preference
  applicants based on race, color, or national origin”. Columbia officials
  hailed one part of the deal – the Trump administration agreed to unfreeze
  $1.3bn in funding. That freeze was devastating Columbia’s research programs.
  But David Pozen, a constitutional law professor at Columbia, denounced the
  deal, saying it “gives legal form to an extortion scheme”. Pozen described it
  as the “first-ever cutoff of congressionally appropriated funds to a
  university, so as to punish that university and impel it to adopt sweeping
  reforms, without any pretense of following the congressionally mandated
  procedures”. Pozen slammed this deal-by-deal style of governance as
  “coercive”, “arbitrary”, “deeply susceptible” to “corruption” and “corrosive
  to the democratic order and to law itself”. We shouldn’t be shocked that Trump
  acts this way. He loves dealmaking and lording it over others and he has long
  paid scant heed to following the law. But we should be shocked by the way the
  two other supposedly co-equal branches of government, Congress and the supreme
  court, have behaved. They have essentially rolled over in the face of Trump’s
  ruling by shakedown. Republican lawmakers in Congress have cravenly sat on
  their hands while Trump has boosted inflation and sabotaged economic growth by
  forcing tariffs on more than 90 countries, notwithstanding the strict
  restrictions Congress set on when and how a president can impose tariffs.
  Republicans have vowed never to raise taxes, but let’s not fool ourselves:
  Trump’s tariffs are a regressive sales tax that hits non-affluent Americans
  hardest. Republican lawmakers have also been quiet as mice while Trump has
  used a wrecking ball to threaten leading universities – institutions that
  played a vital role in making the US a world leader in medicine and many other
  fields of research. The supreme court has been strangely, worrisomely silent
  while Trump rules by shakedown, even as many district court judges have shown
  plenty of spine, ruling, for instance, that Trump’s across-the-board tariffs
  and assaults on law firms are illegal. When the supreme court wants to move
  quickly, it often finds a way. It would be great if the court moved to protect
  the rule of law, universities and academic freedom from Trump’s shakedowns.
  The court could and should issue a ruling as soon as possible that Trump
  violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by egregiously failing to follow its
  requirements before freezing universities’ funding. Similarly, the court could
  greatly reduce the economic mayhem that Trump’s tariffs are causing by quickly
  upholding the US court of trade’s ruling that Trump has far overstepped his
  authority to impose tariffs. But the high court been shamefully passive, even
  submissive. Congress and the supreme court need to wake up, step up and lay
  down the law. They must stop Trump’s rule by shakedown, which far too often
  involves capricious, vindictive dealmaking and ignores our legal rules and
  standards. Americans need to realize that Trump’s style of governance is
  dangerously eroding our rule of law and democracy. Steven Greenhouse is a
