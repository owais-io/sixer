  Children as young as 11 feel tempted to try betting after being “flooded” by
  celebrities and sports stars promoting it, according to two reports that found
  nearly 90% of children aged 13-17 are exposed to gambling content online. The
  UK’s leading gambling charity, GambleAware, which commissioned the reports,
  urged regulators and policymakers to address social media accounts and
  influencers producing betting content on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram,
  TikTok and Twitch in light of the findings. In one survey of 2,100 children
  aged 11-17, a quarter said seeing a celebrity gambling, or advertising it, had
  made them want to follow suit, rising to more than a third (36%) among boys
  aged 16-17. This was despite the fact that almost four in five children agreed
  that nobody under the age of 18 should be exposed to content and advertising
  about gambling. The legal age to bet is 18. In a second study, based on focus
  groups with children aged 13-17, 16% reported seeing content creators sharing
  links and sign-up codes for gambling operators, while 14% reported seeing them
  sharing betting tips and tricks. The reports warned about content produced by
  mainstream UK operators as well as unlicensed sites promoting newer or
  unregulated products associated with video games such as “skins betting” and
  “loot boxes”. Both involve the use of in-game digital items that have value to
  players and can be traded, staked or won via mechanisms that replicate
  real-life gambling. Niks Kolosnicins, 24, developed a gambling addiction that
  severely disrupted his schoolwork and lasted into his university years. “I
  used to see a huge amount of gambling ads when watching online streamers and
  esports – and with my favourite influencers promoting gambling, and many of my
  friends regularly betting, gambling became normalised for me,” he said.
  Children who contributed to the study referred to seeing well-known sports
  stars in gambling content. The Labour MP Beccy Cooper, who has called for a
  new gambling act to replace 2005 legislation introduced under Tony Blair’s
  government, said existing laws were “failing to protect children from online
  gambling marketing where influencers portray gambling as socially acceptable
  or aspirational”. She added that “future generations should look back on this
  era of proliferation, targeting and sports gamblification with the same level
  of disbelief”. The Liberal Democrat peer Don Foster described the report as
  “extremely concerning” and called for greater scrutiny of gambling
  advertising. Heather Wardle, a professor of gambling research and policy at
  Glasgow University, said content seen at an early age can mean that gambling
  becomes “embedded deeply within social practices”. “Evidence shows there is a
  real risk of escalating harms among this already higher-risk age group,” she
  added. The previous government and Labour have taken steps to tighten up
  elements of gambling regulation – including cutting the maximum stake on
  online slot machines to £5 – but have stopped short of strict curbs on
  advertising. Zoe Osmond, the chief executive of GambleAware, said: “It is
  unacceptable that children’s environments continue to be flooded with
  age-restricted content.” A Department for Culture, Media and Sport
  spokesperson said: “We recognise the impact harmful gambling can have on
  individuals and their families, and we are absolutely committed to
  strengthening protections for those at risk, including children and young
  people. “There are already a range of robust rules in place on gambling
  adverts, including rules to ensure adverts are not targeted at or strongly
  appeal to children. “We will continue to work closely with the gambling
  industry to ensure that advertising is appropriate, responsible, and does not
  exacerbate harm.” The Guardian approached the Betting and Gaming Council for
  comment.
