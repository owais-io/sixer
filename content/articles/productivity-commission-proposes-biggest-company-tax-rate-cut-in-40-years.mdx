  The company tax rate would be slashed to 20% for all but the very biggest
  businesses as part of an “ambitious” Productivity Commission proposal aimed at
  boosting investment and revitalising the country’s flagging productivity. The
  plan would deliver the biggest reduction in the company income tax rate in
  nearly 40 years and dramatically shift Australia from having one of the
  highest to one of the lowest rates in the world. The PC on Thursday night
  released its interim report on how to create a more dynamic and resilient
  economy, the first of five separate inquiries commissioned by Jim Chalmers
  late last year. Alex Robson, the PC’s deputy chair, said the tax proposal was
  “ambitious but sensible”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “We need to spark
  growth through investment and competition – the best way to do that is to
  reform our company tax system,” he said. Robson argued that Australia’s high
  headline company tax rate versus its peers was a barrier to foreign investment
  and there was evidence that it was driving local entrepreneurs to set up
  business in lower-taxing countries. He argued that lowering the tax rate for
  the more dynamic smaller and medium-sized business sector would provide the
  biggest “bang for buck” when it came to driving local investment. The PC also
  recommended the government do more to reduce the “ever-growing thicket of
  rules and regulations”, which was acting as a handbrake on growth by making it
  more difficult to, for example, supply homes, build green energy
  infrastructure and start a business. “Better regulation and approvals” will be
  a major area of discussion on day two of Chalmers’ three-day economic reform
  roundtable to be held in three weeks’ time. Chalmers, in a statement
  accompanying the release of the PC’s interim report, said “reducing regulatory
  burden is an important part of our productivity effort” but made no mention of
  the company tax plan. Labor has sent no signals that company tax relief is
  among its reform priorities and has instead looked at ways to crack down on
  tax avoidance by multinationals and make changes to the resource rent tax for
  gas exporters. Ed Husic, the former industry minister, in May last year was
  reportedly scolded for publicly backing a lower company tax rate or expanded
  investment allowance. A survey by Newgate released this week found that only
  25% of Australians supported cutting the company tax rate, and nearly half
  opposed it. But Robson said the PC was “focused on good reform ideas”. “We
  think it’s a good proposal that’s worthy of serious consideration, and we
  leave the politics to others.” Economists have long blamed Australia’s
  declining productivity on a similar decline in capital expenditure as a share
  of the economy and Robson said the company tax cut was the “main lever” to
  drive investment growth. Under the plan, the company tax rate on the 1.2m
  companies that earn below $50m would drop from 25% to 20%, while the rate for
  roughly 7,000 businesses earning between $50m and $1bn would fall from 30% to
  20%. That would leave about 500 of the biggest firms with no additional tax
  relief. The deep cut to the company income tax rate would be accompanied by a
  world-first net cashflow tax of 5%, which would apply to all businesses and
  help make the tax package “broadly” revenue neutral over the longer term. “The
  introduction of the net cashflow tax means that while most companies will pay
  less tax, the total tax burden will rise for some large companies, especially
  those not undertaking new investment,” the report said. “Overall, the new tax
  will incentivise new capital expenditure across all firm sizes.” The PC will
  now conduct another round of consultation ahead of a final report due by the
  end of the year.
