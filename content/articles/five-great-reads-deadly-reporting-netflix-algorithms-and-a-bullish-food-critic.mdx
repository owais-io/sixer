  Happy Saturday. My first read is dedicated to one of the five journalists
  killed in Gaza this week – Mariam Abu Dagga, Moaz Abu Taha, Hussam al-Masri,
  Ahmed Abu Aziz and Mohammad Salama. 1. ‘Make me proud’: Mariam Abu Dagga On
  Monday, five Palestinian journalists were killed in southern Gaza after they
  were struck by an Israeli double-tap strike on al-Nasser hospital. At least
  192 Palestinian journalists have been killed since 7 October 2023, according
  to the Committee to Protect Journalists (the UN puts the figure even higher).
  This profile of Mariam Abu Dagga captures the “rare honesty and courage” of
  the 33-year-old photojournalist and mother of a 13-year-old boy, Ghaith. She
  is remembered as someone who carried “her camera into the heart of the field”.
  Dying message to her son: “You are my love, my heart, my support, my soul and
  my son whom I am proud of.” How long will it take to read: a bit over two
  minutes Further reading: ‘He loved his work deeply’: the five Palestinian
  journalists killed in Gaza airstrike. 2. Arundhati Roy’s ‘wild, imperfect,
  fatherless life’ This extract from the Booker prize-winning author Arundhati
  Roy is a gripping glimpse of what is to come in her new memoir, evoking the
  poetic vividness of her first novel The God Of Small Things. Would they ever
  find a safe space? Roy retraces her early life in India, when her brother and
  her extraordinary but difficult mother moved from a hill station squat to an
  eccentric household in Kerala, where family members begrudgingly took them in.
  How long will it take to read: eight minutes 3. ‘There’s only one Norman
  Harris’ You’d better strap in for Andy Welch’s rocking read on Norman Harris:
  the man behind the world’s most famous guitar store. It’s a banger. While
  Norman didn’t “single-handedly create the vintage guitar market, he certainly
  shaped it” after accidentally becoming a guitar dealer back in the 1970s,
  Welch writes. His unassuming shopfront in California has gone on to sell used
  and vintage guitars to the likes of George Harrison, Slash, Dave Grohl and
  even Marty McFly. *** “I didn’t think anybody would ever believe that I’d
  spent the day with George and bought his Beatles guitar.” – Norman Harris. Fun
  fact: Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow bought their son one of Harris’s
  guitars for his 16th birthday. Lost to the Future: Marty McFly’s red Gibson is
  a Harris guitar too. Sadly, it’s been lost for decades. How long will it take
  to read: about five minutes 4. The rise of the ‘algorithm movie’ Soon the
  routine conundrum of scrolling through a streaming service’s landing page to
  find the most suitable watch could be gone. Already Netflix is making films
  guided by its users’ data – pleasing audience members, but resulting in safer,
  more generic and forgettable movies. Algorithms are dulling our taste buds:
  Phil Hoad’s long read this week looks at what the Netflix algorithm has done
  to our films. What about AI? “Most interviewees I canvassed think we are still
  some years away from AI producing a boundary-pushing script,” Hoad writes, but
  some say we should expect a ChatGPT “cookie-cutter Christmas movie” soon. How
  long will it take to read: about 11 minutes (still quicker than me trying to
  choose a film) 5. Cooking for Seamus And now take a U-turn to one of the more
  wholesome corners of the internet. Meet Seamus, the disabled rescue bull with
  his own cooking show. Seamus lives in regional Victoria and is obsessed with
  human food. His carer Archer decided to make a low-fi YouTube series
  consisting of celebrity cooks making a meal for this gentle beast. Archer
  about Seamus: “I believe he has one of the most advanced palates in the
  history of the world.” How long will it take to read: just over two minutes
  Further reading: and since you’re already on the internet to read this, I
  recommend watching an episode. It is delightful. Sign up If you would like to
