  financial crisis musical

  There have been some high-profile dramas about the fiscal greed and corruption
  that preceded or precipitated the 2008 financial crisis, from The Lehman
  Trilogy to Enron. James Graham’s musical, premiering at the Edinburgh
  international festival, is at least as epic, even if it bites off more than it
  can possibly chew. It takes us back to the real-life drama of the Royal Bank
  of Scotland and the government bailout after its collapse. Fred Goodwin was
  CEO and the bank had such a meteoric rise under his tenure that it claimed to
  be the largest in the world. Graham works hard to make the banking part of the
  story snappy – and succeeds. Directed by Andrew Panton, it is pacey even if
  long, serious but funny, all set to song and kinetic projections across towers
  on Anna Fleischle’s set which might be inflated columns of the share index.
  There is musical comedy even as the singing chorus presides over Goodwin’s
  fall; darker satire as banking culture is captured, complete with after-hours
  karaoke nights (Franz Ferdinand’s Take Me Out, Kylie Minogue’s Can’t Get You
  Out of My Head etc). This is a moment in economic history when bankers such as
  Goodwin (Sandy Grierson) become emperors, trumping the power of parliament, so
  it seems. Grierson plays a fascinatingly bland tyrant, looking every bit the
  accountant he is by training. But like his office lover, Rita (Hannah
  Donaldson), says, he is a lion lying in the grass. When he reveals himself as
  such, he is ruthless indeed: a white-collar Scarface, high on power. Graham
  gives Goodwin’s tale the ancient Greek treatment at times, with ghosts,
  hallucinatory hissing characters and the emergence of what seems like an
  underworld beneath the cracked reality of banking life. From this, amid
  rumbles and puffs of smoke, Brian Cox emerges as the spectre of moral
  philosopher and founder of free market economics, Adam Smith. He is
  entertaining rather than fearful and seems knowingly to be Brian Cox the actor
  playing Smith the character. In between discussions on Smith’s “invisible
  hand” the tone flips back into a comical vein. Smith admires Goodwin’s scented
  candles and develops a penchant for John Lewis. There is a satirical diversion
  into A Christmas Carol territory, with a snowy night-time trip across
  Edinburgh, that serves no greater purpose. It is entertaining nonetheless, and
  Cox amuses as Smith. Some of the antithetical elements do clash and dilute
  meaning. Is this a play about hubris, you wonder, or a satire of it – or is it
  attempting to grapple with the nature of capitalism itself rather than just
  Goodwin’s legacy? Its scope is so broad, its characterisation broad-brush too
  and there is not enough drama to Goodwin’s actual downfall. Some balls are
  dropped, such as Goodwin and Rita’s relationship – its trajectory all but
  abandoned after one comical sex scene. Yet Graham’s marshalling of material is
  impressive overall, and it is a miracle that the flips from comedy to
  Gothicism and back do not jar. Graham has, as always, done his homework on the
  subject, meticulously so. Co-produced by Dundee Rep theatre, and set in
  Edinburgh, there is knowing local humour (Leith is labelled an underworld, New
  Town is heaven, for example). Scottish statesmen stand at the centre of No 10
  politics: Alistair Darling (Sandy Batchelor) is amusingly drawn. Gordon Brown
  (Andy Clark) becomes something of an ethical touchstone, the hero of the piece
  here even though, as Goodwin points out, it was Brown who gave him the freedom
  to take RBS down the disastrous road that he did. Everyone is flatly drawn,
  though that does not impede the enjoyment. There are explanations of Adam
  Smith’s philosophies, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and capitalism itself, but
  the fourth wall is never pierced. Characters often face the audience while
  delivering a mini treatise, and it is miraculous too that this does not seem
  like heavy-handed exposition. It becomes clear that Goodwin follows the word
  of Smith’s ideas but not the spirit. This is what leads him to his amoral
  drive towards acquisition. We hear how he only read one of Smith’s books – not
  the one that spoke of the ethics of the free market. It is a funny turn in the
  narrative, but too flip to be convincing. Goodwin’s fall never really comes
  either, dramatically. He stares out at the audience defiantly, even as the
  lights go down. There is no remorse, no learning. It’s chilling but also
  anti-climatic. Yet still sparky and exuberant as Graham’s plays always are,
  with heaps of knowledge, humour and sharp lines. It sprawls, turns eccentric
  corners and defies expectations. Its ambition, and epic scope, is
  simultaneously a strength and weakness. • At Festival Theatre, Edinburgh,
