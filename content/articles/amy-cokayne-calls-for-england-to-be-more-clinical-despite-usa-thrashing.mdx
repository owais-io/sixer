  England want to be “more clinical” at the Women’s Rugby World Cup, their
  hooker Amy Cokayne said after the 69-7 thrashing of the USA in Friday’s
  opening game. While the Red Roses were dominant on the scoreboard, the
  performance was not the most efficient, with many try chances going begging
  because of errors. Cokayne, who is playing in her third World Cup, said
  England would be frustrated with the points they left out there and also a
  failure to deal cleanly with the USA’s kicks at restarts. “There are a few
  things that didn’t quite go right, so lots for us to work on,” the 29-year-old
  said. “We’ll look at it, but it is competition rugby. You have got to get a
  win, haven’t you? “As forwards, we look at the kick receipt as like our third
  set piece. It is something we work on quite a lot and it is something we want
  to go well in games. We know is an easy in for teams to get the ball back. “We
  need to be more clinical in the goal zone. When we get in there, we have to
  come away with points. “We set ourselves certain standards for each week. We
  want to be more clinical and more ruthless. A few times we didn’t manage to
  execute that very well. We are always striving to be better.” Zoe Aldcroft,
  the captain, attributed a few errors, particularly in the early stages, down
  to nerves because it was the start of their campaign. However, Cokayne said
  there were none from her perspective. “I don’t really believe in nerves. I
  think nervousness and excitement are the same thing, it’s just how you look at
  it. A lot of the girls were excited. It has been an amazing spectacle to come
  to the Stadium of Light, a massive crowd against a good opposition.” The crowd
  broke the attendance record for an opening Women’s Rugby World Cup game with
  42,723 at Sunderland. They watched as England dominate the scrum and Cokayne
  said in the buildup to the Pool A game that the Red Roses were constantly
  working on how to find an extra 1% at the set piece. Cokayne said she felt
  there was a point to prove: “After the captain’s run, someone asked me whether
  that was going to be a tough day at the office for us, so we had a bee in our
  bonnet to put a marker down. Our scrum has been a weapon for us. We work on it
  every day in training and it is not just three of us [the starting front row].
  Everyone is doing their job there.” The Red Roses travel to Northampton where
  they will face Samoa on Saturday.
