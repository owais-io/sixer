  Canada’s largest airline has started cancelling flights during the peak summer
  travel season ahead of a strike by more than 10,000 flight attendants over
  what they say are “poverty wages” and unpaid labour for work when planes are
  not in the air. Air Canada said it would start suspending flights on Thursday
  ahead of full shutdown on Saturday after the flagship carrier and the union
  representing the flight attendants failed to resolve a months-long dispute
  over pay and working conditions. About 130,000 customers a day could be
  affected by a disruption, according to the airline. Air Canada and the
  Canadian union of public employees (Cupe) have been negotiating a new
  collective agreement for flight attendants since March. Among the unresolved
  issues are wages and compensation for work carried out on the ground. Flight
  attendants are currently not paid for any work before or after the plane takes
  off. Air Canada’s vice-president of corporate communications told CBC News on
  Tuesday that there was a “huge gap” between the two sides. Air Canada says it
  has offered “an increase of more than 38% on global compensation”, but the
  union says that figure still fails to fully account for inflation. Air Canada
  also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work
  done before planes take off, but Cupe says its members should be fully paid
  for that labour. Earlier this week, the union representing Air Canada’s flight
  attendants declined Air Canada’s request to resolve negotiations through
  arbitration. Under that scenario, a third-party arbitrator would weigh
  proposals from each side and then make a final decision that both the union
  and Air Canada would have to accept. “Despite our best efforts, Air Canada
  refused to address our core issues,” the union said after it rejected the
  request for arbitration. Air Canada says its decision to gradually suspend
  flights will allow for an orderly winding down of operations. The airline said
  it had also made arrangements with other carriers to give customers possible
  alternative travel options amid one of the year’s busiest travel periods. “We
  regret the impact a disruption will have on our customers, our stakeholders
  and the communities we serve,” said Michael Rousseau, Air Canada’s chief
  executive, in a statement. Canada’s federal minister for jobs and families,
  Patty Hajdu, said in a social media post on X on Tuesday evening that she was
  monitoring the situation, but that the federal government was not stepping in.
  “The best agreements are the ones the parties reach themselves,” she wrote.
