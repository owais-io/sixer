  In a moment when we should be celebrating one of the most important pieces of
  legislation in American history, we are in fact at a worse place as a nation
  than when it was passed. Those of us fighting to protect the right to vote
  find ourselves against a movement that doesn’t want to take us back to 1965.
  They want to create an America that more closely resembles the one of 1865.
  Sixty years ago, in a rare and profound act of consensus, Congress passed a
  law to end the centuries-old rigging of American democracy. Yet today the
  system is as rigged as ever, with the battered Voting Rights Act on life
  support. The erosion of our rights is playing out before our eyes. Purged
  voting rolls have helped to install a regime that arrests undocumented people
  and American citizens alike. A loss of faith in the system led many people to
  stay at home on election day; now they live in fear of walking outside their
  door. Empowering states to create restrictive laws has yielded less access to
  not only the right to vote, but to healthcare, jobs and home ownership. At the
  center of this is Donald Trump – a man whose legacy as president is marked by
  rampant voter disenfranchisement. This is a man whose claim to fame is fame
  itself, who views voting as nothing more than a popularity contest that he’s
  terrified to lose. It’s why he questioned the integrity of our democratic
  network in 2020 instead of graciously accepting that 7 million more Americans
  preferred Joe Biden over him. Trump’s campaign against voting rights marches
  on, as he fills the courts with judges who will continue to kill civil rights
  through a thousand cuts. Barriers to voting and the silence of those still
  able to cast ballots has emboldened and empowered him to bully media
  conglomerates into complacency and corporations into abandoning diversity,
  equity and inclusion efforts. Free of fear from the voters, Trump has gone
  full bore in desecrating the legacy of the civil rights movement – going so
  far as to use government files on Dr Martin Luther King Jr to distract from
  his own political headaches. But we cannot in this moment forget the power
  King saw in the right to vote. In his 1957 Give Us the Ballot speech at the
  Lincoln Memorial, King declared to 25,000 people that with the vote: “We will
  no longer have to worry the federal government about our basic rights.” Yet
  today that fear persists, perhaps stronger than ever. We have indeed come full
  circle from March 1965, when the nation was rattled by the images of a young
  John Lewis and dozens of peaceful protesters getting their heads cracked open
  and their organs bruised on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The national outrage of
  Bloody Sunday that sparked mobilization toward passage of the Voting Rights
  Act has been replaced by a numbness to Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  raids, the arrests of elected officials and the snipping of social safety
  nets. The solution to it all remains the right to vote. A week after the
  brutal beatings in Selma, King declared voting “Civil Right No. 1” in the New
  York Times. He called it the “foundation stone for political action”, one we
  must build upon today. Within five months, Congress bravely voted to end
  racist literacy tests, enable federal examiners to protect voter registration,
  and fight the ugliest forms of voter suppression. America was stronger for a
  generation, until the election of her first Black president sparked a
  conservative backlash that is today at its peak. The opening salvo came in
  2013, when the supreme court gutted the law’s core federal pre-clearance
  provisions in Shelby county v Holder. It chipped away more eight years later,
  giving states further authority to enforce stricter voter ID laws, purge voter
  rolls, and reverse early and absentee programs meant to expand access to the
  polls. In short, Shelby v Holder opened the door for a manicured version of
  Jim Crow. It is for these reasons that we will lead a March on Wall Street
  later this month. The 28 August demonstration, held on the anniversary of the
  March on Washington, will send a message to Trump and his Maga allies in
  Congress. You may restrict our ability to vote in the president, the senators
  and the Congress members we support. But you cannot restrict how we vote with
  our dollars. Black voters have a skyrocketing buying power expected to hit
  $1.7tn by 2030. We must use it to make sure those we support stand by us.
  Until we get to a day when the integrity of voting is restored, when we can
  finally pass the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, we will use the
  power we have. Trump may use the bully pulpit of the White House to influence
  companies’ investments in Black America, but we have the ability to hit their
  bottom line. Celebrating this anniversary of the Voting Rights Act means
  honoring the sacrifices of those who shed their blood and laid down their
  lives for our most fundamental freedom and recommitting ourselves to the
  struggle by tapping into the unwavering hope and persistence that fueled the
  civil rights movement. To settle for anything less would be unconditional
  surrender to the segregationists against whom King, congressman Lewis, Fannie
  Lou Hamer and the other great civil rights leaders stood. Rev Al Sharpton is
  an American Baptist minister, civil rights activist and radio talkshow host
