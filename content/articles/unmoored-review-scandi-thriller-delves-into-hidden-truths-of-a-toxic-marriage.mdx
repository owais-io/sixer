  Unmoored review – Scandi thriller delves into hidden truths of a toxic
  marriage 
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-12T10:00:05Z'
bodyText: >-
  Expectations are raised high, but not satisfyingly met, in this initially
  intriguing and certainly atmospheric Scandi thriller that ranges from Sweden
  to Poland and Exmoor in England; it teases hints of Gone Girl and Patricia
  Highsmith. Screenwriter-producer Michèle Marshall has adapted 2014 novel The
  Living and the Dead in Winsford by veteran Swedish crime writer Håkan Nesser,
  and Caroline Ingvarsson makes her feature directing debut. The scene is the
  stylish home of a Swedish power couple. Maria (Mirja Turestedt) is the
  presenter of an popular TV talkshow, and she is married to the older Magnus
  (Thomas W Gabrielsson), a star academic with a drinking problem and a seedy
  reputation for infidelity. Maria is a former student of Magnus and has, in
  fact, surpassed him intellectually, now faintly despising herself for her
  middlebrow job as well as for editing and almost secretly co-writing papers
  for Magnus, who grumpily relies on her help. But Maria despises herself still
  more for standing by Magnus despite a rape charge against him. With an ugly,
  boorish defiance, Magnus intends to brazen it out legally and claim consent;
  in her heart, Maria does not believe him. Things come to a crisis when the
  couple are driving through Poland after visiting an old friend of his,
  quarrelling constantly. They stop to look at an abandoned military bunker and
  things take a terrible turn. A series of flashbacks and a final, tense
  conversation with a police inspector are to disclose most (but, bafflingly,
  not quite all) of what is supposed to have happened. The audience are perhaps
  entitled to ask what precisely went on in the bunker, given that a final
  moment-by-moment revelation does seem to be implicitly promised; there are odd
  plot points that have been telescoped and garbled, possibly lost in the edit.
  Disappointing overall, but a strong performance from Turestedt. • Unmoored is
  in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 August
