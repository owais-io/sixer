  Liverpool are the club most-often linked with a move for the Crystal Palace
  captain Marc Guéhi but some of the continent’s other big hitters are now being
  chucked into the mix. The centre-back’s contract is up next summer and he
  could be allowed to enter discussions with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus
  at the turn of the year, which would see the Eagles potentially miss out on a
  massive wad of cash. Manchester United are still doing their best to offload
  Antony but the main interested party is Real Betis. The Brazilian impressed in
  Andalucia in the second half of last season but the Spanish side might
  struggle to make a dent in the £82m fee that brought Antony to Old Trafford.
  Naturally, the Premier League side will want as much of that back as they can
  get but it is going to be a struggle and beggars cannot be choosers. Another
  United player who might be on his way is youngster Ethan Williams who could go
  to Croatian side Rijeka on loan. Many people have Yves Bissouma on their
  Turkish Super Lig bingo card. The good news is they could soon be winners
  because the Tottenham midfielder is in talks over a loan move to Galatasaray.
  It is taking a very long time for Chelsea to sort out signing Alejandro
  Garnacho, who has told everyone and his barber that he is eager to leave
  Manchester United for Stamford Bridge. The Blues therefore need an
  alternative, which they have found in the form of Barcelona’s Fermin López.
  Chelsea are yet to make an offer but have sounded out the player’s
  representatives to see if he might be open to swapping Catalonia for London.
  Appeasing Nuno Espírito Santo is very important at Nottingham Forest. The head
  coach wants some full-backs so the recruitment bods have identified Leicester
  left-back Victor Kristiansen and have opened dialogue with the Championship
  side over signing the defender. There could be more business to be done at the
  City Ground if West Ham get their way and sign Ibrahim Sangaré after enquiring
  about the central midfielder . Fulham are at risk of losing midfielder Andreas
  Pereira who is wanted by Palmeiras and could be gone in a matter of days. In
  transfers no one saw coming, Nathan Patterson is rumoured to be about to swap
  Everton for Sevilla. The Scottish right-back has not pulled up any trees since
  moving from Rangers and a sojourn to La Liga might be the tonic required.
  David Moyes wants to secure a replacement before his fellow Scot waves
  farewell. The three big options are Lyon’s Ainsley Maitland Niles, Barcelona’s
  Héctor Fort and Norwich’s Kellen Fisher. As you may have noticed, Yoane Wissa
  is rather eager to leave Brentford for Newcastle. If he is eventually granted
  his wish, the Bees would desperately need a new striker. At the top of the
  hitlist is Max Beier of Borussia Dortmund. The 22-year-old was left on the
  bench on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season, so is almost certainly
  available. Sheffield United have been absolutely terrible so far this season.
  The Blades have zero points from three matches under Rubén Sellés and realised
  they need to acquire some experienced players. Danny Ings is close to heading
  to Bramall Lane and he could be joined by Ben Mee, which would be two very
  logical signings.
