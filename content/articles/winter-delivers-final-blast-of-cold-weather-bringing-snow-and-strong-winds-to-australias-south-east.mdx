  Spring might be beginning on Monday but it hasn’t felt that way for several
  parts of south-eastern Australia blanketed in snow this weekend by a late
  wintry blast. Snow flurries were reported as far north as the northern
  tablelands of New South Wales and down to as low as 400m above sea level in
  Tasmania, according to Sandra Scully, a meteorologist at the Bureau of
  Meteorology. These conditions had been brought on by a “very vigorous cold
  front” which crossed south-eastern Australia on Friday, Scully said. Sign up:
  AU Breaking News email It initially reached parts of South Australia and
  western Victoria before it crossed the remainder of Victoria and pushed into
  NSW on Saturday. “This was the third of a series of cold fronts that moved
  across south-eastern Australia this week, really from Wednesday,” Scully said.
  “It’s been a period of bursts of really windy and showery conditions for the
  last few days but it was the last front that had the coldest air associated
  with it.” The system brought widespread damaging winds, as well as cold air,
  showers, storms, small hail, large waves and snow down to low levels. When it
  crossed SA there were probably two small tornadoes in the Adelaide suburbs
  early on Friday morning, with official observation showing winds were in the
  damaging (but not destructive) realm, according to Scully. Many locations
  received snow which usually don’t, including the Mount Lofty Ranges and the
  Flinders Ranges – the first time they’d seen snow since 2022, she said. In NSW
  there was snow in Walcha in the northern tablelands, in Oberon, Orange and
  Isabella in the central tablelands, as well as in Jindabyne and Island Bend to
  the north-west. There were also reports of flurries at Mount Macedon in
  Victoria and heavy snow on Ben Lomond in Tasmania. The strongest wind gusts
  occurred on Saturday around Victoria, with a 128km/h gust at Mount Hotham,
  124km/h at Mount Buller, 119km/h at Wilsons Promontory, 116km/h at Cape Nelson
  and 107km/h at Mount William in the Grampians. There was also an 106km/h gust
  at St Kilda in Melbourne. “It was a particularly windy Friday night into the
  early hours of Saturday morning for Victoria – the front crossed the across
  the Melbourne metro area around about midnight,” Scully said. The cold front
  that brought all of this wild weather cleared out into the Tasman Sea on
  Saturday, dragging with it the peak winds, and the winds eased across eastern
  Victoria and NSW on Saturday evening, with all warnings cancelled. “It’s
  brought very cold air up over the country last night – clear skies allowed
  those very cold temperatures to plummet even further,” Scully said. As a
  result, there were widespread areas of frost through inland parts of
  south-east and eastern Australia on Sunday morning.
