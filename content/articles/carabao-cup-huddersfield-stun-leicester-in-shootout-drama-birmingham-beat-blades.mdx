  The goalkeeper Lee Nicholls was the hero for Huddersfield, who overcame
  Championship opponents Leicester via a penalty shootout after an entertaining
  2-2 Carabao Cup first-round draw at the League One club’s Accu Stadium.
  Huddersfield started strongly and Ruben Roosken and David Kasumu both had
  strong penalty shouts turned down early on after both appeared to be tripped
  inside the box. The hosts held Leicester at bay until nine minutes after the
  break, when the right-back Hamza Choudhury smashed a half-cleared ball into
  the far top corner. That brought the game to life and Huddersfield reacted
  best, with Roosken awarded a penalty after Choudhury brought him down. Dion
  Charles’s spot-kick was saved but the 19-year-old midfielder Dan Vost headed
  home the rebound in the 65th minute for his first senior goal. Leicester
  restored their lead three minutes later, Stephy Mavididi squaring for his
  fellow substitute Harry Winks to curl the ball into the bottom corner. Again
  Huddersfield found a response, with the youngster Cameron Ashia claiming his
  second goal in two games by curling a fantastic effort into the top corner.
  That sent the game to a shootout, where Huddersfield prevailed 3-2 as Bilal El
  Khannouss hit a post and Nicholls saved efforts from Jordan Ayew and Kasey
  McAteer. The Terriers will visit Sunderland in the second round. Gustavo Hamer
  produced an early contender for goal of the season but it was not enough to
  stop Birmingham advancing with a 2-1 victory against Sheffield United thanks
  to Jay Stansfield’s late winner. Stansfield, an England Under-21
  international, struck three minutes from time with a deflected effort which
  booked the hosts a home tie against Port Vale. Birmingham had made almost all
  the running and wasted numerous chances to build on a fifth-minute lead given
  to them by Kyogo Furuhashi after good work by Demarai Gray. But Hamer’s
  introduction off the bench early in the second half breathed fresh life into
  the Blades and he stunned the home crowd with a magnificent drive from 50
  yards. The midfielder picked up a loose ball in midfield before sending a shot
  beyond James Beadle, a debutant, who had strayed marginally off his line.
  However, with spot-kicks beckoning, Stansfield twisted and turned inside the
  area, firing off a shot which was diverted past Adam Davies by a slight touch
  from a covering defender. Pierce Charles saved twice and Liam Palmer scored
  the winning spot-kick as the Championship crisis club Sheffield Wednesday beat
  Bolton of League One 4-2 on penalties. Charles, the only player to retain his
  place from Sunday’s league defeat at Leicester, kept out efforts from Aaron
  Morley and Max Conway before Palmer booked a home derby with Leeds. Victory
  was well deserved for Henrik Pedersen’s young guns despite Wanderers going
  down to 10 men after the defender Sam Inwood’s 30th-minute red card. Pedersen
  named five teenagers in his starting lineup and Gui Siqueira smashed them into
  a 20th-minute lead. Bolton equalised for the first time through Jordi
  Osei-Tutu after 36 minutes. However, the Owls’ skipper, Ike Ugbo, restored the
  visitors’ advantage with a cool right-foot finish a minute later. The
  substitute Thierry Gale’s first Bolton goal after 77 minutes looked to have
  earned penalties, only for Reece Johnson to make it 3-2 after 80 minutes.
  Wednesday were heading through until the substitute Amario Cozier-Duberry’s
  dramatic stunning stoppage-time leveller. However, Charles was the hero with
  his double saves to delight Wednesday’s travelling fans. Oakwell hosted
  another first-round shootout, with Barnsley emerging victorious 5-4 on
  spot-kicks against Fleetwood after the match finished 2-2. The visitors had
  forced penalties deep into added time, with Owen Devonport bringing up his
  side’s second equaliser. However, Murphy Cooper was the hero, saving
  Fleetwood’s first penalty by Ryan Graydon and later denying George Morrison as
  the shootout went to sudden death. Cheltenham scored in each half to ease past
  Exeter 2-0 – the defender James Wilson gave the hosts the lead in the 28th
  minute before the midfielder Ryan Broom, back at the club this season after a
  spell at Fleetwood, gave his side breathing space and set up a visit to
  Cardiff next month. Manchester United will travel to League Two Grimsby in the
  Carabao Cup second round as they attempt to bounce back from one of their
  worst seasons in recent history. The 2023 winners will head for Blundell Park
  during the week beginning 25 August after being paired with the Mariners in
  Wednesday night’s draw, in which they were the last team out of the hat.
  Elsewhere, there are all-Premier League clashes between Bournemouth and
  Brentford and Wolves and West Ham, while promoted Leeds face a trip to either
  Bolton or Sheffield Wednesday and Everton will host League One Mansfield at
  the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Sides involved in Europe this season – Liverpool,
  Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, League Cup holders Newcastle, Tottenham,
  Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace – will enter the competition
  in the third round.
