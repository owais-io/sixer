  Good afternoon. Australia’s government has rejected Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  incendiary criticism and accused some Israeli politicians of “bigoted” views
  about Palestinians, as the extraordinary political fight between the two
  nations turns uglier. The federal government’s refusal of a travel visa for
  the far-right Knesset member Simcha Rothman stoked criticism from the Israeli
  prime minister, who labelled Anthony Albanese a “weak politician” who had
  “abandoned Australia’s Jews”. “Strength is not measured by how many people you
  can blow up or how many children you can leave hungry,” the home affairs
  minister, Tony Burke, told Radio National on Wednesday. “Strength is much
  better measured by exactly what [Albanese] has done, which is when there’s a
  decision that we know Israel won’t like, he goes straight to Benjamin
  Netanyahu.” On Wednesday afternoon, Albanese said he wouldn’t take Netanyahu’s
  comments personally. “I engage with people diplomatically. [Netanyahu] has had
  similar things to say about other leaders.” Top news Bruce Lehrmann has become
  a ‘national joke’ and can’t afford barrister for defamation appeal, his lawyer
