  The Perseid meteor shower is widely regarded as the best of the year but
  better than that, it is happening this week. Active from mid-July until the
  end of August, the shower peaks on the night of 12 to 13 August, when it can
  be possible to see as many as 100 meteors an hour streaking across the sky in
  all directions from the radiant point. From more urban environments, expect an
  average of as many as one a minute. Unfortunately, this year the moon will be
  a waning gibbous with more than 80% of its visible surface illuminated, and
  its glow will wash out the fainter meteors. The chart shows the view looking
  north-north-east from London on 12 August 2025 at 22:00 BST. The radiant is
  marked “Perseids”. Even though it is August, wrap up warm, settle in to a deck
  chair to prevent neck ache and then spend as much time under the night sky as
  possible so that your eyes become well adapted to the dark. This will help see
  the fainter meteors and the more time you are outside, the greater your
  chances of seeing an exploding meteor, called a fireball. The shower is not as
  easily visible from the southern hemisphere where the radiant is lower in the
  sky.
