  During the middle ages, monks would travel to the village of Llanafan Fawr in
  mid-Wales to visit the church and relics of St Afan, a son of the king of
  Gwynedd, martyred by foreign pirates centuries before. Today, a different sort
  of pilgrim can be found there. Two hilly, wooded parcels of land in Llanafan
  Fawr have been bought by the Woodlander Initiative (TWI), a land-buying scheme
  led by Simon Birkett, a far-right figure with links to Patriotic Alternative,
  the UK’s largest fascist group. Critics say Wiltshire-based Birkett’s aim is
  to create a racially exclusive settlement; he has cited Orania, a whites-only
  town in South Africa, as an inspiration for the project. TWI successfully
  bought the two small plots totalling a few acres from a local farmer late last
  year, after attempts in Cumbria and East Sussex fell through. Since launching
  in 2023, the group has raised £165,000 of a goal of £1m – money Birkett plans
  to use to buy land or property in every county in Britain. “We need to start
  building that alternative, our own businesses, our own institutions,” Birkett
  said during an address at Patriotic Alternative’s annual conference last
  October. “We need our own schools, with our own rules.” He added: “We need our
  own areas, we need our own land, we need our own buildings, we need our own
  conference centres. We need our own communities for our own culture. And it is
  down to us to start building it.” Birkett is now making this dream a reality.
  No one was around during the Guardian’s visit last week, but the larger plot –
  previously an open field – is now a campsite. It hosted several tents, along
  with camping gear, solar panels, a wood store and a toilet block. Some of the
  fencing was clearly new and, at the second hilly, wooded site, a small gazebo
  was perched among the oak trees. According to anti-fascist group Hope Not
  Hate, which exposed the TWI purchases in Llanafan Fawr, Birkett has already
  hosted members of PA at the sites, which are about 20 metres apart. A “family
  camp weekend” is planned for 13-14 September. Birkett and others using the TWI
  properties have sought help from the community. The area is accessed via a
  road belonging to the neighbouring farm owned by Delia and John Weedon, who
  said that people at the site have previously asked them for water, and help
  putting up fencing. “I helped them out by driving some wood and fencing stuff
  up the hill once. They seemed nice enough, they wave sometimes when they’re
  going by,” John Weedon said. “We only heard about these far-right rumours
  later. Now the whole area is talking about them.” TWI denies it is a white
  supremacist organisation. In an email to the Guardian, Birkett said that TWI
  is not building a village, although that would be “a worthwhile endeavour”,
  and noted that the group’s membership criteria “does not mention colour or
  ethnicity”. Its constitution states it is a non-political organisation aimed
  at “building community, friendships, skills and fraternity”. However, in a
  recent article, Birkett invoked the “great replacement” conspiracy theory,
  claiming that “those in power” are “intentionally replacing one population
  with another”, and that “white Europeans are being outbred” by migrants. Last
  week, dozens of videos on TWI’s YouTube channel in which Birkett talks about
  his political views, including how he hopes Llanafan Fawr will become a
  “beacon surrounded by darkness where every other town around becomes more
  diverse, more corrupt”, appeared to have been taken down. It is unclear
  whether William Jones, the farmer who sold the land to Birkett, knew about his
  buyer’s background in advance. Jones could not be reached, and his wife,
  Joanne, declined to comment. A few miles away in Builth Wells, the nearest
  town to tiny Llanafan Fawr, reaction to TWI’s presence was mixed. Leigh Price,
  the owner of survivalist shop the Bug Out, said several members of TWI had
  bought supplies and equipment from him, and Birkett had been in touch by phone
  to ask advice about where to find building materials locally. “All this white
  supremacist stuff is nonsense. I don’t think you can be right wing or say
  anything much these days without getting outlawed as a far-right group,” he
  said. Jamie Owen, a bartender at the 14th-century Fountain Inn, said he was
  taken aback to find out about TWI. “Why here in Builth? They’re not local,” he
  said. “I would hope they’d get short shrift if they came into town.” A shop
  owner on the high street, who asked not to be named, said: “I can imagine
  there will be some people here who welcome them. All I hear about from
  customers and in the pub is Reform, Reform, Reform, immigrants … Even though
  we don’t really have many in Builth.” Mayor Mark Hammond said that he hoped
  TWI would keep to themselves. “This part of Powys is very independent-minded,
  very mixed, politically. They may well get some support here, but if they
  cause any issues for the farmers or people who are very protective of the
  Welsh rural culture, then I can see there being some backlash.” According to
  Hope Not Hate senior researcher David Lawrence, the far right in Britain has
  long dreamed of establishing whites-only communities, and similar efforts have
  been pursued by Combat 18, the British National Party, and the now-proscribed
  terrorist organisation National Action. “These initiatives face significant
  financial and logistical challenges, and most have either failed to
  materialise, fractured due to internal conflict, or been abandoned due to
  dismal conditions and the property sold off,” he said. Yet as far-right groups
  frustrated by electoral politics mount growing anti-migrant protests, the idea
  of racially exclusive enclaves appears to once again be gaining traction in
  extremist circles. In a recent article in the fascist magazine Heritage &amp;
  Destiny, Patriotic Alternative leader Mark Collett praised TWI as a “fantastic
  initiative”. “This is a long-term plan that will hopefully catch on and turn
  into the establishment of indigenous heartlands – places for our people,” he
  said.
