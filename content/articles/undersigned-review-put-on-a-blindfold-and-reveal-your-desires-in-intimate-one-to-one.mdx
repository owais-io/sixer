  Undersigned review – put on a blindfold and reveal your desires in intimate
  one-to-one

  I have been banned from this show. As will you be, if you can nab a ticket.
  Part of the thrill of this intoxicating slice of occultism, designed for one
  blindfolded audience member at a time, is your lack of knowledge going into
  it. No one is allowed to go twice. What takes place is a summoning, a ritual
  both dark and deeply sentimental. Through gentle, probing conversation,
  creator Yannick Trapman-O’Brien demands to know what you desire, and what you
  are willing to sacrifice to get it. As he leaps and twirls around your mind,
  his dexterous chatter is confronting, charming and sharp as a pinprick. The
  simple structure, framed around ideas of traditional witchcraft, guides you in
  a way that responds specifically to your comfort levels and the depths you are
  willing to dive to. Requested topics can be off limits, but ideally you’ll be
  OK with blood. The show’s inebriating effect is akin to the intense focus of
  someone drawing your portrait, or reading your tarot, or giving you therapy.
  It is a magic trick of sorts, lulling you into openness. With the blindfold
  disarming my senses and a crackling candle by my ear, a vertigo effect makes
  the voice I hear simultaneously distant and close enough to touch. My hands
  start to feel heavy and I hear myself saying things I didn’t plan to share.
  The final 10 minutes offer a gift of a different kind, with a glimpse into the
  thinking of the participants who have gone before. Seeing how others responded
  to the same prompts is revealing about both parties; there are so many
  conversations here that I would have liked to press my ear to the wall to
  catch. With delicious playfulness and an underlying earnestness, Undersigned
  encourages indulgence and challenges your moral makeup. Through its
  supernatural proclivities and Trapman-O’Brien’s balletic conversation, the
  show sends you back out into the world looking at it a little more rosily. By
  asking what you want, Undersigned makes you appreciate what you already have.
