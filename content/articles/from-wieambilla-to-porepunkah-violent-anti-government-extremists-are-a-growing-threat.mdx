  growing threat

  When the Queensland authorities wanted to understand the motivation of the
  Wieambilla killers, they turned to Josh Roose. The political sociologist and
  associate professor of politics at Deakin University was given access to the
  killers’ writings to paint a picture of the process of radicalisation that led
  Gareth, Stacey and Nathaniel Train to shoot three police officers and a
  neighbour in cold blood in a 2022 ambush at a remote property about 350km west
  of Brisbane. He was one of two experts who later gave evidence at a coronial
  inquest into the deaths. Almost one year to the day that the Wieambilla
  inquest wrapped up, another three police officers were shot at a rural
  property near the town of Porepunkah in Victoria. Two were killed, and one was
  wounded and remains in hospital. Roose says there are “remarkable parallels”
  between the two shootings – despite the fact that Dezi Freeman, who is accused
  of the Victorian attack, has been linked to the “sovereign citizen” movement,
  which the Trains did not identify with. Both, says Roose, were
  “anti-government extremists”. “In both cases, obviously an ideological
  orientation and deep hatred of police was critical,” he says. Freeman called
  police “terrorist thugs”, “frigging Nazis” and “Gestapo”. Gareth Train – the
  leader at Wieambilla – called them “devils and demons” and, Roose told the
  inquest last year, believed himself to be at war with police . Freeman
  reportedly subscribes to a set of beliefs described as “pseudolaw” or
  “sovereign citizenship”; believing that the government’s decisions, and
  therefore its laws, are not legitimate and that adherents are not required to
  follow them. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Trains, says Roose, were not
  “sovereign citizens”, though Gareth briefly dabbled in the theory. Instead, he
  says, they developed a radical form of Christian theology, “pre-millennial,
  dispensationalist apocalyptic ideology – effectively the belief that the end
  times were coming”. The inquest heard that Gareth was a lifelong conspiracy
  theorist but his beliefs evolved into a more sinister form as an adult,
  particularly while living on the remote rural property. Both Gareth Train and
  Freeman appear to have been radicalised online, Roose says. Train allegedly
  developed his views in the YouTube comments section, communicating with a US
  conspiracy theorist, Donald Day. “Covid-19 in particular was a real accelerant
  for this, people spending a lot of time online, feeling disconnected, angry,
  marginalised, and looking for answers,” Roose says. “And the sovereign
  citizenship ideology places all the blame back on government for personal
  woes. “There are deeper-seated socioeconomic issues that tie in to the broad
  polarisation of society, and particularly across democracies. It’s a global
  phenomenon.” US sovereign citizens have killed police in a string of terrorist
  attacks since the 1990s. Terry Nichols, a self-described sovereign citizen,
  helped plan the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people. The FBI
  has described it as a “domestic terrorist movement” and a threat to law
  enforcement. The New South Wales police came to the same conclusion in 2015.
  Roose says the movement is growing and is increasingly dangerous. That danger
  is particularly present when policemust visit a remote property. In Victoria,
  police were executing a warrant; in Queensland, it was a missing person’s
  search. “Properties holds symbolic value to sovereign citizens, and they view
  it as an invasion, effectively, when police come on to their property,” he
  says. “VicPol seemed to be aware of that; they had 10 officers there … But
  being aware of the explosive, incredibly violent nature of this ideology is
  critical, and being prepared for all future interactions.” Inquest findings
  ‘being prepared’ The president of the Queensland Police Union, Shane Prior,
  who spoke to the family of the Wieambilla victims this week, says the
  Porepunkah incident had “brought back a whole lot of unwanted and traumatic
  memories”. “The death of fellow officers – although interstate – serves as a
  solemn reminder of the risks all police face daily,” he says. The Queensland
  state coroner, Terry Ryan, sat for five weeks of hearings last August,
  investigating the deaths of civilian Alan Dare and police constables Rachel
  McCrow and Matthew Arnold, as well as the three Trains. He heard days of
  evidence about the police response and the process of online radicalisation. A
  spokesperson for the Queensland coroner’s court says the findings “are
  currently being prepared”. The Arnold and McCrow families used the inquest to
  push for changes to “policing processes, procedures or policies”, demanding
  reforms “be introduced immediately”. Speaking on behalf of both families,
  McCrow’s mother, Judy, said: “We pose this question to authorities: could a
  national weapons and ammunition register, drones and satellite-based
  communication strategies reduce the current risk?” Roose says income
  inequality and economic injustice will continue to drive people toward
  dangerous ideas like sovereign citizenship. “This is a symptom of a much
  deeper malaise: a lack of trust in government, a lack of engagement,
  particularly amongst older Australians in towns and suburbs,” he says.
  “They’ve got to be reached. They’ve got to rebuild that social compact.
  “People who are doing well in life … do not go and subscribe to this sovereign
  citizen stuff. “It’s important to understand this is not a problem that’s
  going to go away.” • In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300
