  Beyond the coppiced hazels edging Pinsley Woods, outside Church Hanborough,
  wheatfields shimmered gold. A lizard skittered in leaf litter, making a racket
  as loud as a rodent. In the tallest hazel branches where nuts had ripened
  first, a pair of squirrels were flinging down cobnuts (“cob” meaning “to throw
  gently” in Kentish dialect) to be picked up later, autumn on their mind. Still
  downy, the fruit combined two subtle shades of lime and apple green. The other
  type of hazelnut besides the cob – the filbert – is a longer nut, named in
  honour of St Philibert of Jumièges whose feast day falls on 20 August, when
  the nuts are thought to ripen. Squirrels don’t follow the church calendar,
  though, so I find empty casings scraped with rodent teeth marks. Meanwhile,
  road verges are blushing with haws in various shades of red. Plums, sloes and
  black elderberries bend the branches. Feral apple trees too are becoming
  visible, linear orchards by the side of roads. Orchards are traditionally
  enclosed spaces, like the one at Wolvercote that I stumbled on last spring. A
  flock of long-tailed tits moved like flick knives through one lichened tree.
  There was a memorial to Ralph Austen, whose Treatise of Fruit-trees, published
  in 1653, argued that planting orchards was the best way to improve land, using
  pigeon and hen dung, and cattle’s blood as fertiliser. Fruit trees would feed
  the poor and lure them away from growing barley for beer. Some of the roadside
  apple trees have fruit as showy as Christmas decorations. Windfalls spill out
  on to the hard shoulder, enticing passersby to stop. Few do, of course,
  because of the speeding traffic. But driving along the A420, I decide to take
  my chances, and pull over. I step among the indigo plumes of viper’s bugloss
  and common mallow, wondering how many of these trees are the result of cores
  tossed from car windows. I approach a tree with fruit the size of cherries,
  more like crab apples. I bite it to its delicate core. It’s tart but not
  bitter, and not cultivated for high sugar content – the essence of apple. Like
  the squirrels, I too sense the coming of a new season. • Under the Changing
