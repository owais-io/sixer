  Just before sunset on a luminous August evening, a few boats pulled up outside
  a waterfront stage at SeaWorld San Diego, the controversial theme park known
  for its dolphin and orca shows. Two people on a jetski idled next to the
  boats. They were waiting for the music to begin. Everyone was here to see
  Ginuwine, the R&amp;B singer famous for Pony (1996) and In Those Jeans (2003).
  But why was the 54-year-old master of the late-90s sex ballad headlining a
  show at an aquatic theme park for children? Clips from previous SeaWorld
  concerts had been going viral on social media all summer, fueled by the
  internet’s deep confusion. A parade of late 90s and early 2000s hip-hop and
  R&amp;B stars, including Soulja Boy and Bow Wow, the Ying Yang Twins and
  Trina, had taken SeaWorld’s island stage in the past two months. Rolling Stone
  dubbed it “one of the summer’s most viral concert series”, right after Beyoncé
  and Kendrick Lamar. “Why is SeaWorld rebranded as BET Spring Bling?” one
  widely shared post asked. “I love it because it makes no sense whatsoever,”
  another user admitted. A Reddit user rewrote the lyrics to Pony with a
  SeaWorld focus: “If you’re Shamu, let’s do it, ride it, my orca.” Some
  audience members at the Ginuwine concert on Saturday night were cynical about
  the show’s appeal, noting that the unexpected venue was giving artists long
  past their prime renewed attention, or wondering whether the concerts had been
  engineered to bring more Black families to SeaWorld. (A park spokesperson says
  they were not.) The animal rights group Peta has called it an attempt to
  rebrand the park’s image, tarnished by the 2013 documentary BlackFish, which
  raised questions about its treatment of orcas. “We hope artists will steer
  clear of these desperate abusement parks,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
  Clips on social media showed crowds of fans dancing and cheering, but I
  wondered if, in person, a SeaWorld performance might feel more like a farce,
  or even a tragedy. What I did not expect was that Ginuwine’s SeaWorld concert
  would turn out to be a masterclass in ageing gracefully – no matter your
  surroundings. My SeaWorld first My trip to see Ginuwine was my first
  experience of the six-decade-old southern California aquatic theme park, which
  offers a bewildering mishmash of attractions: sea-themed amusement park rides,
  carnival games, encounters with live animals and full-on sea mammal and killer
  whale shows, all of them mobbed with exhausted parents and crowds of
  enthusiastic children. The number of signs advertising additional animal
  contact for a fee made the park feel a little bit like a red-light district of
  the sea. Did I want to non-consensually touch a shark? I did not. SeaWorld,
  which is part of a publicly traded amusement park company, argues that it has
  changed substantially since its founding in 1962, and that its animal shows
  are now focused on education, conservation and science, not mere
  entertainment. The company’s response to those who say the conditions of the
  park are cruel is to ask people to visit the park and see for themselves.
  Jackie Plaza, the vice-president of marketing and sales at SeaWorld San Diego,
  said that the viral hip-hop concerts do not actually feature any live animals
  – say, dolphins leaping into the air during the climax of a song – because of
  the park’s core values. “Everything we do with animals has an educational
  component behind it. Having dolphins jump during concerts doesn’t meet one of
  our pillars,” Plaza said. The park does invite its headlining artists to
  experience the park with their family and friends before the show. “Trina met
  our dolphins, with her backup dancers,” Plaza said. Bow Wow and Soulja Boy
  went to the orca experience. The park’s president, Tyler Carter, took Baby
  Bash’s kids on the penguin encounter. I had assumed that my Saturday evening
  at SeaWorld would be completely focused on the Ginuwine concert, but that was
  far from true. The throwback musical performance was happening at just one of
  the park’s amphitheaters. At other aquatic stages, the typical programming
  went on: dolphins and whales were swimming in circles, pounding the water with
  their tails and splashing the shrieking customers in the “soak zone”. When I
  asked a park employee at the dolphin stadium where to find Ginuwine’s concert,
  I was told: “On the other side, by the orcas.” What did it feel like, I
  wondered, to be an ageing veteran of the music industry, and to be competing
  for billing with Shamu? There was no musical opening act for Ginuwine’s 6pm
  concert, making the de facto opener a 5pm performance on the other side of the
  park by Melanie, a 650lb dolphin who did tricks for fish. As I watched the
  35-year-old dolphin obediently splash a small grinning child, I found myself
  getting anxious. Melanie was good. All the dolphins were good. As music
  thrummed through the amphitheater, a trio of dolphins, lithe and dazzling,
  leapt into the air, and then leapt again. The audience oohed. How could even
  the most formidable ageing human artist compete? Pony fans I shouldn’t have
  worried. Ginuwine, the stage name for Elgin Baylor Lumpkin, has been wooing
  audiences for three decades. Even SeaWorld could not slime his suave. These
  days, you might be most likely to hear Ginuwine’s music at a karaoke bar: the
  explicit Pony (“If you’re horny, let’s do it, ride it, my pony”) is a
  perennial favorite. Like sex itself, Ginuwine’s songs are ridiculous in every
  way and yet still mesmerizing. “Looking tasty, really scrumptious,” he sings.
  “Tell me: is there any more room for me in those jeans?” As I wandered towards
  the concert venue, almost every park sign I saw began to sound like a
  suggestive Ginuwine title. Animal Interactions? The Jellyfish Experience?
  Despite Ginuwine’s greatest hits being more than two decades old (one of his
  sexy songs is about a two-way pager), much of the audience waiting for him at
  SeaWorld was enthusiastic. Gloria Means, 73, a travel nurse from Nevada, had
  come to SeaWorld for the day with her cousin, Lorna Harbin, 63. They were so
  excited to see that Ginuwine was performing that they paid an extra $50 each
  for reserved seats with a better view. Means was pleased to learn that the
  R&amp;B star’s appeal was spreading to new generations: when she texted her
  daughter-in-law and granddaughter about the concert, her granddaughter
  demanded: “What do you know about Ginuwine?” “They don’t ever think that
  granny had a life before she was granny,” Means said. Shortly after 6pm,
  Ginuwine, dressed all in white, appeared on the causeway that led to a small
  island stage. He waved first at the boats, then turned to his fans on shore
  and grinned. He still had a megawatt smile. The performance that followed was
  simple yet impressive: just Ginuwine and two gray-bearded backup singers who
  had been working with him for decades. No dancers, no special effects.
  Ginuwine did not sing Pony while riding on a real dolphin, or even a model of
  Shamu. (Don’t pay Beyoncé prices, don’t expect Beyoncé effects.) Though he
  threatened to jump in the water and swim to his fans, he did not. But he was
  still handsome, he still could sing and for this 3,400-person audience in a
  bizarre venue, the R&amp;B legend absolutely did not phone it in. Concertgoers
  swayed along to their old favorites, waved their hands and took photos of
  themselves dancing by the water. The audience included millennial friends and
  couples celebrating birthdays, mom friend groups with crowds of kids and at
  least one local influencer. In the front row, Troyae Grant was livestreaming
  the concert directly to her mother via FaceTime. Ginuwine repeatedly told his
  fans how grateful he was for them and their support. While one San Diego
  couple told me that some very adult SeaWorld performances in previous years
  had prompted parents to flee the arena with their kids – particularly, they
  said, when Ashanti performed in 2023 – Ginuwine’s show was restrained in its
  sexiness. He avoided any SeaWorld puns. He did not say: “Your panties are the
  soak zone.” The only time he expressed any bitterness over his current status
  in the industry was when he thanked SeaWorld for giving him a full hour to
  perform, and said how frustrating it was to be only given a few minutes
  onstage at recent concerts. “I got 30 years in the business and 10 albums. Why
  are you going to give me 15 to 20 minutes?” he asked. There were sounds of
  outrage from the women around me. It was refreshing, in these times, to
  witness a public figure act with dignity – to see Ginuwine, through his own
  sense of self-respect, turn what could have been a farcical performance into
  one that was graceful, even moving. Decades after his chart-topping days, he
  still believed in the value of his artistry and the delight of his
  performance, and he made them real. It was a stark contrast to the country’s
  youth-and-growth obsessed culture: a vision of ageing without shame, seeing an
  older artist’s smaller crowds, gentler moves and less-limber bodies as simply
  a different phase of a beautiful career, not a painful letdown from the peak
  of youthful fame. It didn’t hurt that the small SeaWorld stage offered the
  vintage performers a stunningly gorgeous view across San Diego’s Marina Bay.
  The water was framed with swaying palm trees, the kind of sunlit natural
  beauty that much larger and more prestigious venues could not provide. The
  travel nurse and her cousin, who had not expected to see a Ginuwine concert
  that day, both left satisfied. Ginuwine was “old school”, Means said: “He gave
  us a show.” “It was da bomb,” Harbin said.
