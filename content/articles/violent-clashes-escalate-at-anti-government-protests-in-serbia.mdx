  Anti-government protests in Serbia escalated on Friday night amid reports of
  police brutality and excessive use of force. It was the fourth day of unrest
  in cities across the Balkan country, including in the capital, Belgrade, where
  police fired teargas at demonstrators and tried to separate rival groups of
  protesters. Dozens of people have been injured in the violent clashes, while
  hundreds have been detained over the past week, as nine months of largely
  peaceful anti-corruption and pro-democracy protests have reached boiling
  point. On Friday night, Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, said the state
  was stronger than any protest and praised the police for their conduct during
  the latest demonstrations. “This is the phase of despair and helplessness,
  when you have nothing more to offer the citizens except beatings, clubs, and
  all the rest,” he told the national TV broadcaster RTS. Serbia’s interior
  minister, Ivica Dačić, denied that police had used excessive force, instead
  blaming demonstrators for allegedly attacking the officers. Videos on social
  media showed police with shields and batons beating up protesters as flares
  lit up the streets. The rallies on Friday were held under the slogan: “Let’s
  show them we are not a punching bag.” Demonstrators reportedly threw rocks and
  eggs at police, who then charged at them in the wide boulevard in front of the
  Serbian government headquarters. The clashes were between riot police,
  anti-government protesters, and Vučić loyalists. The pro-government
  demonstrators have been accused of hurling fireworks, rocks and glass bottles
  at anti-government protesters. In the northern city of Novi Sad on Thursday
  night, anti-government protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling
  Serbian Progressive party, or SNS, chanting “he is finished” as they smashed
  windows and covered walls with red paint. The student-led protests began in
  November last year after the collapse of part of the outdoor roof at Novi Sad
  railway station killed 16 people. Many blamed the tragedy on entrenched
  corruption and negligence in state infrastructure projects. Vigils for the
  victims swiftly escalated into mass demonstrations, with hundreds of thousands
  of Serbians demanding an investigation into the tragedy, as well as early
  elections. The protests have rocked the Serbian government, causing Miloš
  Vučević, the prime minister at the time of the Novi Sad disaster, to resign
  and the end of his cabinet. Yet Vučić remains in power, despite accusations
  that he has stifled democratic freedoms while allowing corruption to flourish.
  Alain Berset, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, wrote on X on
  Friday that he was “concerned” by the violent protests in Serbia. “I call for
  calm and respect of the right to peaceful assembly. Serbian authorities must
  uphold Council of Europe standards. The rule of law and respect for human
  rights must prevail.”
