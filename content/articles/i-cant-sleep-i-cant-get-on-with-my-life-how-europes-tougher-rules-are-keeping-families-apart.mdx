  Standing outside Germany’s parliament in June, Ahmad Shikh Ali fought back
  tears as he held up a blurry photo of his three-year-old son. Since fleeing
  Aleppo more than two years ago, Shikh Ali had done all he could to secure his
  son a safe future: moving to Hanover, getting full-time employment and wading
  through endless paperwork so that his wife and son could join him. He was
  close to reuniting with his family, with just two cases in front of his in the
  queue. That was, until Germany’s lower house of parliament passed a bill in
  June to suspend family reunifications for migrants like him for at least two
  years. “Since I learned of this decision I can’t sleep, I can’t get on with my
  life,” Shikh Ali told reporters as he broke into tears. “My son was crawling
  when I left him; he is walking now.” It is a hint of how people’s lives have
  been reshaped in recent months as a handful of governments in the EU move to
  restrict family reunification. While campaigners have contextualised the
  measures as part of a wider push by politicians to be seen as tough on
  migration, they say the focus on family reunification is misguided. “It really
  doesn’t make sense,” said Federica Toscano of Save the Children Europe. “We
  have politicians who proudly claim to want to make migration much more
  manageable, fair, organised and planned – and family reunification is one of
  the most planned, legally secure and integration-promoting ways of taking in
  people who are seeking protection.” In March, Austria became the first in the
  EU to temporarily suspend family reunification for refugees, citing
  overstretched social services. Politicians in Germany, Portugal, Finland and
  Belgium soon followed. Several governments have attempted to invoke a sense of
  emergency to push through the measures, which clash with the right to a family
  life enshrined in treaties such as the European convention on human rights and
  the EU’s charter of fundamental rights. “Family unity is a value in our
  society,” said Toscano. “But when it comes to foreign families, it seems like
  this becomes less important, less valuable.” A recent study by Save the
  Children in Finland found that the average reunification process took six and
  a half years, with some families spending as long as 10 years in limbo. The
  restrictions on family reunification belie the fact that the number of people
  arriving through these programmes remains relatively small. In Austria, for
  example, about 18,000 people arrived in 2023 and 2024 through family
  reunification programmes. About 13,000 were children. Many had lived through
  “long, painful” years of being separated from a parent, said Toscano. “The
  longer the process takes, the more trauma you add to these children.” The
  measures could also backfire by boosting the criminal networks that the EU has
  long purported to be against, said Thomas Willekens of Refugee Action
  Flanders. Faced with few other options, people may “decide to take the
  irregular route and perhaps use human smugglers”, he said. He saw a similar
  incongruence among those calling for restrictions on family reunification.
  “It’s striking to us that the political parties who in their programmes attach
  a lot of value to family life, to families as the core of society, are at the
  forefront in limiting the right of a family life of a certain group.” In
  Germany, more than 380,000 people – most of them Syrians – are expected to be
  affected by the plans to suspend family reunification for migrants with
  subsidiary protection status, which grants legal residency to people who do
  not qualify as refugees but could face serious harm if sent back to their
  country of origin. Berlin first suspended family reunification for this group
  in 2016, later partly reinstating it in 2018 with a cap of 1,000 visas a
  month. The negative effects of family separation have long been documented,
  from adverse mental health to feelings of isolation. Wiebke Judith, of the
  German refugee rights advocacy group Pro Asyl, said: “It’s extremely hard for
  people who come here and are worrying every day about their kids, their
  spouses, to concentrate on learning German, finding a job or on doing normal,
  everyday things. It’s a huge mental burden that can lead to signs of
  depression and frustration.” The process often takes a toll on everyone
  involved. “It really destroys families; the lack of seeing each other, the
  lack of being with each other but also the frustrations from the long waiting
  times,” she said. “It’s just something that can really break people, to be
  this much at the mercy of the authorities just to see their closest family.”
  In Austria, where the centre-right People’s party (OVP) has long taken a
  hardline stance on migration, the government had already blocked other safe,
  legal pathways for asylum seekers, said Aimée Stuflesser of Amnesty
  International Austria. “Now without family reunification, this means people
  will be taking much more irregular routes that will risk their integrity and
  their life, so we really see this as also life-threatening,” she said. Women
  and children, in particular, would probably be put in more danger by the
  measures, she said. “We know that women are in more vulnerable situations when
  they take irregular routes,” she said, pointing to risks such as exploitation,
  abuse and trafficking. “Migration will not stop. People want to be with their
  family and they cannot stay in their home countries. So this will mean more
  people risking their lives to be together.”
