  We will wrap up the live blog here. This is what made the news: The foreign
  minister, Penny Wong, signed Australia to a joint statement with 29
  international partners decrying the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Belinda
  Allen, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank, expects the RBA to wait
  until November before cutting again – but that could depend on how the data
  unfolds. The Commonwealth Bank recorded $10.25bn in annual cash profits – up
  4% – and delivered a bumper $2.60 payout per share to shareholders. The prime
  minister, Anthony Albanese, said he is up for “big reform” as his government
  heads into a long-promised productivity roundtable next week. The Australian
  Federal Police said a man was arrested at Sydney Airport after an incident
  where a police firearm was discharged inside the T2 domestic terminal. The NSW
  government is considering a temporary ban on e-bikes, e-scooters and other
  e-mobility devices on trains and metro services amid growing concerns about
  the fire risk of lithium-ion batteries. The commonwealth ombudsman has found
  the Department of Home Affairs wrongfully detained 11 people in the past year,
  including an Australian citizen and another person improperly held for 18
  months. David Southwick, the Coalition police spokesperson, described the
  Victorian government as “all talk and no action” when it came to introducing
  tougher protest laws. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers said the government was
  focused on other measures when asked about the unions’ suggestion of a
  four-day work week. Until tomorrow, enjoy your evening. Ombudsman warns more
  resources needed for investigating whistleblower complaints The Commonwealth
  Ombudsman says his agency needs more resourcing to investigate complaints made
  by whistleblowers about the handling of their disclosures. The federal
  government’s whistleblowing system is complicated but, put simply, a public
  servant wanting to shed light on potential wrongdoing has to submit a public
  interest disclosure (PID) to their agency’s PID officer. The PID is assessed
  by the officer to determine whether it’s valid, and then allocated for
  investigation. If a discloser is not satisfied with the investigation, it can
  go to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In cases where a PID officer identifies a
  conflict of interest – for example, allegations against the agency’s senior
  bosses – it can also be referred to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. It’s a regime
  that’s been heavily criticised since it was introduced because many would-be
  whistleblowers get sucked into a bureaucratic and legally technical blackhole.
  The ombudsman, Iain Anderson, described it this afternoon in a parliamentary
  inquiry as an “overly complex, overly prescriptive regime” in need of serious
  simplification. But perhaps the most interesting revelation was that the
  ombudsman only has 1.5 staff members on hand to deal with any complaints.
  While Anderson admitted the number can “fluctuate”, he also conceded “it
  probably wouldn’t have been more than four or five at the most”. Meanwhile,
  Anderson noted the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption had about 25
  staff to handle referral and investigation complaints. Tim Wilson says wages
  growth is coming from the public sector The shadow small business and jobs
  minister, Tim Wilson, has downplayed the wage growth figures released today,
  saying public sector wage growth is “borrowing from future generations”. He
  told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: This is a problem with this government; they
  are spending more either directly on public sector jobs or they are building
  out a private economy dependent on public expenditure, not on a long-term,
  sustainable private sector-led economy that expands the economic pie that
  grows in the interests of all Australians. The host, Patricia Karvelas pointed
  out that it was not “factually correct” that wage rises had been achieved from
  borrowing. He said the Coalition wouldn’t say whether it approved what might
  come out of the economic roundtable until the government’s agenda was clear,
  and he accused unions of “gaslighting” workers by proposing a four-day work
  week that had already been shot down by the government. He argued it was a
  piece of “theatre” that would let the government look sensible by rejecting
  it. Hello, Josh Taylor here taking over from Natasha May for the remainder of
  the day. Rishworth: Australia’s Palestine recognition decision is about
  ‘excluding Hamas from the process’ Asked about whether she is worried about
  comments made by the terrorist group Hamas welcoming Australia’s recognition
  of Palestine, Rishworth says: Hamas is going to use whatever they can to
  promote propaganda. They are a terrorist organisation … This move is about
  excluding Hamas from the process. Rishworth: ‘flexibility’ key to government’s
  stance on work/life balance Asked about the ACTU’s proposal for a four-day
  working week, Rishworth says the laws the government has passed already allow
  for flexibility. She says flexibility has driven the government’s position on
  work-from-home and requests for flexible arrangements, including hours and
  location for caring responsibilities. “It is about finding a better balance.”
  Rishworth has shied away from saying if she agrees with the ACTU’s position
  that a four-day working week could “deliver improved productivity and allow
  working people to live happier, healthier and more balanced lives”. What is
  key to the laws that we have passed is around flexibility. Employment minister
  says enterprise bargaining is driving wages growth, productivity Amanda
  Rishworth, the minister for employment and workplace relations, has been
  speaking on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing about wages data released today. She says
  the re-invigoration of enterprise bargaining is driving wage and productivity
  increases with a “record number of employees covered by enterprise
  bargaining”. Rishworth says it is not only public sector growth that is
  responsible for “broad based growth”. AFP charge man after disturbance at
  Sydney airport that saw police firearm discharged A 41-year-old man was
  charged after an incident at Sydney airport this morning that saw the
  discharge of a police firearm, as we reported earlier. Australian Federal
  Police said they responded to the airport’s T2 domestic terminal amid reports
  a man was acting suspiciously. When officers tried to speak with him, they
  allege he became verbally and physically aggressive and they arrested him. AFP
  acting commander Scott Raven said during a press conference the firearm was
  discharged during that arrest: During his arrest, the AFP firearm was
  unintentionally discharged. The circumstances of how the firearm, which was a
  short barrelled rifle, was discharged is now subject to an internal
  investigation. Thankfully, there were no injuries as a result of the incident.
  The man has been charged with one count of obstructing or resisting a
  commonwealth official and one count of creating a disturbance at an airport.
  The first penalty faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison for a first
  offence, and the disturbance charge faces a maximum fine of $3,300. He has
  been granted conditional bail and will appear before court in Sydney on 1
  September. If you want to read more about the news we brought you earlier that
  Home Affairs wrongfully detained an Australian citizen, Tory Shepherd has the
  full story: The opposition, leader Sussan Ley, has called on the prime
  minister to urgently rethink his decision to recognise a Palestinian state at
  the UN next month after Hamaspraised the decision. Ley told Sky News a short
  while ago: And now it’s quite clear that the prime minister is completely out
  of his depth. We have one of the co-founders of Hamas – a listed terrorist
  organisation – praising our prime minister today, in fact, lauding his
  political courage. Now the endorsement of his decision by a listed terrorist
  organisation is exactly the reason the Coalition has opposed it and would
  revoke it in government. It’s up to the prime minister now to explain what he
  does next. Does he stick with this process? Does he recognise? But he needs to
  rethink it. “The prime minister’s eating ice-creams in Queensland, making
  jokes. Meanwhile, a listed terrorist organisation overseas is cheering on his
  foreign policy. I think that tells all Australians he has got it wrong. And it
  really is time for him to rethink this urgently.” Huge lobbying action at
  Victorian parliament by teachers today If you’re around Victoria’s parliament
  today and wondering why there are hundreds of teachers in the corridors, it’s
  part of what’s been described as the “single largest lobbying event ever” held
  in the building. The Australian Education Union brought more than 100 public
  school teachers, school leaders and education support staff to hold 45
  meetings with Victorian Labor MPs. They’re unhappy the government has pushed
  back its commitment to fully fund the Gonski reforms by three years, which
  effectively cuts $2.4bn from public schools. AEU Victorian branch president,
  Justin Mullaly, says Victorian public schools “are the only schools in the
  nation in this situation”. He says: Victorian public schools are the lowest
  funded in Australia and every school in the state is affected – that means the
  learning and wellbeing of every student is impacted. Full funding delivered
  without delay would enable schools to better meet the diverse needs of all
  students, improve learning outcomes, and guarantee that every student in every
  classroom has a fully qualified permanent teacher. That’s all from me, thanks
  for sticking with us. Natasha May will be your guide as the news rolls in.
  Take care. Victoria premier also says four-day week not on her radar The
  Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, was asked earlier to weigh in on the ACTU’s
  plans to propose a four-day working week at the federal government’s
  productivity roundtable. How would this affect her plan to enshrine the right
  to work from home two days a week? Allan told reporters: That’s not something
  that we’re currently considering. My focus, in terms of supporting flexibility
  in workplace arrangements that are good for workers, good for families and
  good for the economy, is supporting more working from home. Power returning to
  NSW south coast after Telstra outage And that Telstra outage should be over
  soon. Telstra just had this to say: The issue was caused by an onsite power
  issue. Power is now restored and we’ve seen services progressively coming back
  online since 1:45pm. Mobile services are now fully restored and most NBN and
  fixed services are restored, we are working on full restoration for the
  remaining small number of fixed services. Thanks to everyone for their
  patience while we got this sorted. Telstra outage affecting more than 100,000
  services on NSW south coast Telstra says a large outage is affecting more than
  100,000 services, including mobile phones, NBN, ADSL and the public telephone
  network, along NSW’s south coast. The company says it will update the
  situationby 4.30pm. Hamas welcomes Australia’s decision to recognise
  Palestinian state as Labor maintains group will have no role in future
  leadership Hamas praised Australia’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state
  at the UN next month in a statement to The Sydney Morning Herald. Sheikh
  Hassan Yousef, a co-founder of the terrorist group, said the move was an
  “important step” for people in Gaza. He told the Herald: We welcome
  Australia’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine, and consider it an
  important step towards achieving justice for our people and securing their
  legitimate rights. This position reflects political courage and a commitment
  to the values of justice and the right of peoples to self-determination. We
  call on all countries, especially those that believe in freedom and human
  dignity, to follow Australia’s example and translate their positions into
  practical steps to support the Palestinian people and end their suffering
  under occupation. A government spokesperson responded to the statement in
  remarks to the SMH, saying Hamas “always tries to manipulate facts for their
  own propaganda,” adding media has a “responsibility to make professional
  judgments to not promote propaganda of terrorist organisations to get cynical
  headlines”. What Australia has done is contribute international momentum
  towards a two-state solution, which Hamas opposes. We are supporting the Arab
  League’s efforts to isolate Hamas. Treasurer Jim Chalmers maintained earlier
  this afternoon that Australia would work to ensure Hamas has “absolutely no
  role” in the future leadership of a Palestinian state. Dead dolphin washes up
  on Adelaide beach amid algal bloom An adult common dolphin washed up dead on a
  popular Adelaide beach on Wednesday morning, wildlife officials said. South
  Australia is reeling from an algal bloom and officials said a necropsy will be
  done to investigate the animal’s cause of death, including any effects from
  the bloom. The dolphin was found on Henley beach. A spokesperson for SA’s
  department for environment and water said in a statement officials do not
  believe marine mammals are at particular risk from the event: Marine mammals
  such as whales, dolphins and seals are not believed to be at immediate risk
  from the algal bloom as it is believed only animals with gills are at
  immediate direct risk. The significance of the algal bloom effects on the
  availability of species that marine mammals prey on is not yet clear. The
  death of marine mammals, while unfortunate, is not an uncommon occurrence,
  particularly during the winter months. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said
  in a statement on Instagram: Our oceans and beaches are sick and dying. This
  is a national disaster devastating our communities and environment, and it
  requires a national response. South Australia can’t manage this climate
  catastrophe on our own. Our communities, businesses and tourism industry need
  support. Bystander at Sydney airport recounts helping officers subdue man
  during incident this morning A bystander at Sydney airport this morning
  described the moment Australian Federal Police officers arrested a man before
  a police firearm discharged, as reported earlier by Guardian Australia.
  William, who did not give his last name, told 2GB in an interview he and his
  travel companion were in the airport’s T2 domestic terminal when the arrest
  took place. The man, who said he is a former NSW Police dog handler, helped
  restrain the unnamed person amid a terminal “full of people”. William told
  2GB: We saw this fellow struggling with the two AFP officers. It’s gone to the
  ground. The AFP officer’s long firearm has gone to the ground and was
  underneath the fellow. As we went to restrain him, the shot has been
  discharged. William added that he jumped into action without thinking, saying:
  “You just do. When these things happen. I didn’t really think.” Chalmers was
  asked about the ACTU’s plans to propose a four-day working week at the
  productivity roundtable. The treasurer said while he had heard the proposal,
  the government was focused on other measures: Our interest here is in making
  sure that people can balance their work and family responsibilities. That’s
  what motivates our position on work-from-home and some of these other
  contentious areas in recent times. We haven’t been working up a policy for a
  four-day week. That hasn’t been our focus. Our focus in industrial relations
  has been abolishing non-compete clauses, protecting penalty rates, extending
  paid parental leave … That’s our industrial relations agenda, and what
  motivates our agenda. Chalmers says government has always been clear on calls
  for hostages to be released Treasurer Jim Chalmers was just asked about the
  Israeli embassy’s statement during a press conference in Canberra. Chalmers
  said the government had always been “very clear on our position on the release
  of the hostages”, saying the recent decision to recognise a Palestinian state
  was about seeing a two-state solution that excluded Hamas from leadership.
  Chalmers said: First of all we’ve been very clear on our position of the
  release of the hostages. The announcement the prime minister and foreign
  minister made this week is about isolating and excluding Hamas from the future
  leadership of Palestine, a state of Palestine. We see recognition making our
  contribution to the international progress and momentum behind this question
  as an important step towards a two-state solution. And a two-state solution is
  all about making sure that families in Israel and in Palestine can raise their
  kids in peace. Hamas will have absolutely no role in that. Israeli embassy
  says Australia should up demands for release of hostages The Israeli embassy
  in Australia said it was deeply troubled a recent joint statement condemning
  the humanitarian crisis in Gaza only had “vague wording” calling of the
  release of hostages held by Hamas since the 7 October attack in Israel.
  Australia was among a group of 29 signatories calling for urgent action to end
  starvation and the blocking of aid into Gaza yesterday. The statement urged
  “immediate, permanent and concrete steps must be taken to facilitate safe,
  large-scale access for the UN, international NGOs and humanitarian partners”.
  It ended with a call for a ceasefire to end the war and for “hostages to be
  released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered”. The Israeli embassy said
  while it shared concern for the humanitarian suffering in Gaza, “it is deeply
  troubling that the plight of Israeli hostages, men and women, held by the
  Hamas terror organisation is reduced to a single line at the bottom of the
  statement,” adding: These innocent civilians are starving in underground
  tunnels … We have yet to hear the Australian government speak with the same
  urgency about their humanitarian situation. Pressure must be placed squarely
  on Hamas to release them immediately, as their continued captivity is a grave
  violation of international law and basic human decency. In recent days both
  prime minister Anthony Albanese and foreign minister Penny Wong have
  repeatedly stressed the need to see all remaining hostages released after
  announcing Australia would soon recognise a Palestinian state. David
  Southwick, the Coalition police spokesperson, described the government as “all
  talk and no action” when it came to introducing tougher protest laws. He told
  reporters outside parliament: We keep hearing words from the premier – strong
  words, no action, and then winding back those words and watering them down and
  giving us weak laws. That’s not what Victoria expects. We need tougher laws
  and consequences … We can’t wait till the end of the year. That’s just
  ridiculous. But the government’s walk back was welcomed by the Greens leader,
  Ellen Sandell, who said the government had “really misread the Victoria
  public” when it floated the “draconian laws to crack down on people’s right to
  peaceful protest”. She said: The Victorian people know that the right to
  peacefully protest when you see something that is unjust is a fundamental
  right in a democracy and the Victorian people don’t want to see the Victorian
  Labor government go down the path of Trump’s America or even the New South
  Wales government that are trying to crack down on the fundamental right to
  peaceful protest. We’re really glad that it looks like Jacinta Allan might
  have to go back to the drawing board. Reactions coming in after reports
  Victoria will scale back proposed anti-protest laws There’s been a lot of
  reaction to our story this morning that the Victorian government will scale
  back its proposed anti-protest laws – including an outright ban on face masks
  at protests and attachment devices. While the attorney general, Sonya
  Kilkenny, would not confirm details in the report, she acknowledged that any
  laws on face coverings at protests would need to allow for their legitimate
  use. She said: There are always legitimate reasons to do certain things and
  these are matters that need to be taken into account. There’s nothing unique
  in drafting and designing these laws. That’s why it’s important to engage and
  consult and listen really carefully to those who are impacted [and to]
  Victoria police. The premier, Jacinta Allan, also admitted to difficulty
  legislating “safe access” areas around places of worship, which she had
  committed to introducing back in December: There’s clearly some complexity
  with those sorts of laws but we are examining options. PM welcomes wage growth
  figures On the news out of the Australian Bureau of Statistics that the wage
  price index rose 0.8% in June, with 3.4% annual growth, the prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, said it was “great news”. We inherited a position where
  inflation was at 6%, real wages were falling, interest rates began to
  increase. Now what we have is inflation down to 2.1%, unemployment is
  relatively low at 4.3%, we have interest rates that yesterday decreased for
  the third time this year and we have real wages increasing. That is a good
  thing. That means increased living standards and is I think welcome, just like
  the interest rate decision. We are working very hard … inflation [is] down,
  interest rates [are] falling, real wages [are] increasing, unemployment [is]
  steady. That is the envy of the Western world in terms of economic outcomes
  that has been produced by the hard work that Australians have been producing,
  it is I think one of the reasons why we received the backing for a second term
  to continue our approach to these measures. Finally, Albanese said he is
  available to meet with the US president, Donald Trump, at very short notice at
  any time and the government has been engaged with American colleagues on a
  ministerial level. He said there have been three phone calls between him and
  Trump, including “a very warm” one after the election. Albanese asked about EV
  road tax, four-day work week Turning to other issues, the prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, is asked about the potential for electric vehicle road users
  to be charged a tax. Albanese notes it has been an issue that has been
  discussed for a decade, and there is a need for money “to ensure roads are
  adequate”. What we need to do is to work those issues through and to come up
  with a realistic plan that can be implemented, and we’ll await those
  discussions. I know Catherine King will obviously play a role in that as the
  transport minister. On the union proposal for a four-day work week, Albanese
  said the government has no plans, but they’re welcome to put forward the idea.
  The ACTU, of course, is entitled to put forward whatever ideas it likes. But
  that doesn’t mean, as I’ve said, that it’s government policy because someone
  put forward an idea. Albanese said it was regrettable the Queensland
  government had pulled out of the Australian Battery Industrialisation Centre
  but said there are opportunities in Queensland, and he has a constructive
  relationship with the state government. Recognition to build on momentum for
  Middle East peace, PM says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, wouldn’t
  comment on whether more protests around Gaza should go ahead, stating it’s
  worked out by state governments, and he won’t speak for the Queensland police
  in regards to a planned Brisbane protest. He said the Australian government is
  “not writing Middle East policy in a backyard here in Brisbane” but said the
  government is trying to build on momentum for peace. People are watching what
  is happening in Gaza. They’re watching it playing out. The catastrophe for
  humanity that is being played out there. And you can either watch or you can
  do what we can, which is to be a part of momentum - we’re not big players in
  the Middle East. What we are, though, what we can do is to add our voice to
  those who are saying: ‘Enough is enough,’ and we need to advance the long-term
  peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. Too many innocent lives
  have been lost. PM holds press conference in Brisbane The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, has been taking questions at a press conference in Brisbane
  over Australia’s move to recognise Palestine. He has repeated that Hamas can
  play no role in a future Palestinian state, and the Arab League and other
  countries in the region have made it clear that Hamas must have no role, and
  must lay down its weapons. Asked if he is concerned that recogntion will harm
  Australia’s relationship with the United States, Albanese says Donald Trump
  has been an advocate for peace in the Middle East. What is a way forward for
  peace and security after 77 years of conflict? The whole world, and indeed
  Australia, has been committed to a bipartisan support to a two-state solution
  for a long period of time. One of those states is Israel, the other is
  Palestine. In order for Palestinians to be able to satisfy their legitimate
  aspirations for their own state, Israel must be assured of security as well,
  and that is what the world is working towards. NSW police arrest three on
  allegations of staging vehicles for a planned public shooting NSW police have
  charged two men and a teenager in Sydney on allegations they were staging
  vehicles for a planned shooting in a public place. Officials conducted a
  high-risk vehicle stop of a car in Sydney’s Blacktown shortly after midnight
  on Wednesday morning, using beanbag rounds and a police dog to intercept the
  vehicle. A man, 21, and a teen, 17, were arrested, with the older man
  sustaining a dog bite. Officer arrested another man, 39, during a stop of an
  SUV in Granville around the same time. Police later executed a search warrant
  at a home in Willmot, where they allegedly seized a loaded revolver, cash and
  electronics. Police have since alleged the 39-year-old and 17-year-old were
  involved in the staging of vehicles for the planned public shooting. The man,
  39, has been charged with multiple counts including recklessly dealing with
  the proceeds of crime, possessing an unauthorised pistol and driving a vehicle
  without a licence, among other charges. The 17-year-old has been charged with
  two counts of driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner and the
  participation in a criminal group contributing to criminal activity, among
  other charges. The pair were refused bail and will appear in separate courts
  today. The 21-year-old was issued a breach of bail and a court notice for
  driving while disqualified. Extra money largely going to savings and offset
  accounts More from CommBank: Households are overwhelmingly sending that extra
  income to their savings and mortgage offset accounts. Customers under 55 had
  all been cutting back on their savings in the three months to June 2024. Over
  the same period this year, they all hiked savings, while customers aged 55 and
  up have hiked their savings even more. Young Australians have also hiked their
  spend on nonessential goods, with under-35-year-olds boosting discretionary
  spending where they had been cutting back a year ago. That age group also
  picked up their spending on essential goods – reflecting just how restrained
  younger workers had been a year ago when underlying inflation was still nearly
  4%. Victoria premier says working from home can help households with ‘precious
  time’ The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, held another press conference on
  her plan to enshrine the right to work from home two days a week. Yesterday,
  she announced consultation on the plan had opened. Today she was joined with
  members of the plumber’s union to speak about how working from home benefits
  even those who are not able to. Allan says: Not everyone can work from home,
  and I think the plumbers here demonstrate that … They’re married to someone
  who can work from home, they love someone who can work from home. She says
  working from home two days a week saves families on tolls, fuel and parking,
  helping the household budget and giving “precious time” back to spend together
  instead of on the commute. Allan says in just 24 hours more than 6,000 people
  have responded to the survey on the Engage Victoria website. Robodebt
  whistleblower says she has paid ‘very high price’ for speaking up A robodebt
  whistleblower has warned of the “scrap heap” she continues to experience years
  after first raising the alarm on the unlawful scheme that affected millions of
  Australians. Jeannie-Marie Blake, a former Centrelink employee, continued to
  work at Services Australia years after making complaints about the “income
  averaging” debt calculation program, but told a parliamentary committee this
  morning she ultimately left the role due to feeling extra “scrutiny” and
  “pressure” internally following her appearance at the robodebt royal
  commission. Blake said: A decade since I first blew the whistle on robodebt,
  and over two years since I gave evidence at the royal commission, I’m still
  suffering. I was so traumatised by my experience that I’m on workers
  compensation, barely subsisting on a fraction of my former salary. Ultimately,
  my family and my career have paid the very high price of speaking up.
  Meanwhile, those most responsible for robodebt have faced no real consequences
  … Ultimately, robodebt was stopped, but we’re left here on a scrap heap,
  paying the high price for our sacrifice, a sacrifice that I made in the
  public’s best interest. I’m not the only one. E-bike fire on a Melbourne train
  in March prompts caution around lithium-ion batteries In relation to the news
  about NSW considering a temporary ban on e-bikes and e-scooters on trains and
  Metro services: Melbourne has seen that risk first-hand. An e-bike caught fire
  inside a Metro train carriage in March, prompting evacuations and a response
  from Fire Rescue Victoria. The deputy commissioner for the service, Josh
  Fischer, said at the time: Time and time again we are seeing incidents
  involving lithium-ion batteries. … Interstate and internationally we are
  continuing to see that risk grow. Victoria is set to introduce new regulations
  banning e-scooters and e-bikes on trains and coaches, with only foldable
  e-bikes and e-scooters allowed on trams and PTV buses. Those draft regulations
  are set to come into effect on 30 September. Public consultation on the
  changes ends on 18 August. Opposition leader tells prime minister to fix
  domestic issues, not global conflicts Anthony Albanese should be focused on
  the kitchen table, not a negotiating table in the Middle East, Sussan Ley
  says. In op-eds and a series of media interviews this morning, the opposition
  leader took aim at the government, saying Labor had lost sight of the cost of
  living crisis for families after the government announced it would recognise a
  Palestinian state at the upcoming UN general assembly. The Coalition said
  yesterday it would reverse that recognition if it won government. In an op-ed
  for the Herald Sun, Ley wrote: These are serious matters, but Australians
  expect their Prime Minister’s first priority to be the kitchen tables of this
  country, not negotiating tables 12,000km away. Day after day, he appears
  fixated on one foreign policy issue to the exclusion of everything else.
  Yesterday, the Reserve Bank reduced the interest rate to 3.6%, the third
  interest rate drop this year, after 13 consecutive rate rises. It also
  downgraded its long-term outlook for Australia’s productivity growth.
  Parliamentary committee investigates creation of whistleblower protection
  agency A parliamentary committee is looking into the creation of a
  whistleblower protection agency this morning. Crossbenchers David Pocock and
  Jacqui Lambie introduced a bill which would create a new independent body to
  offer support and advice to public servants wanting to come forward to the
  National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nacc) or within their agencies about
  suspected misconduct within the government. In its first term, the Albanese
  government said it would consider creating a protection body following the
  Nacc’s opening, but little progress has been made. Jeannie-Marie Blake, a
  former Centrelink worker who raised the alarm on the illegal robodebt scheme,
  spoke of the need for such a body to give whistleblowers confidence to come
  forward. Blake said: When I and others raised concerns, we were met with a
  stark message: resign, transfer or comply. The message was as blunt as that:
  ‘shut up or leave’. Our concerns were ignored, and instead, we received
  threatening communications, performance targets, threats of underperformance,
  Code of Conduct breaches were used to suppress dissent, daily emails reminded
  us that if we were to speak outside our team to anyone about our work, we
  could be terminated. There was no safe, independent mechanism for staff to
  report concerns without fears of reprisals. If such a body had existed, I
  believe many more staff would have spoken out, and robodebt may have been
  stopped before it had even started. Read more about Jeannie-Marie Blake’s
  story here: The commonwealth ombudsman has found the Department of Home
  Affairs wrongfully detained 11 people in the past year, including an
  Australian citizen and another person improperly held for 18 months. In a
  report released on Wednesday, the ombudsman found that only one of the people
  wrongfully detained had made a civil claim against the government. It made
  three recommendations, including that the department provide each “affected
  individual” with a personal apology, including an acknowledgment of wrongdoing
  and “assurance as to remedial actions the Department has taken/intends to take
  to ensure these errors do not occur in future”, and information about how to
  apply for compensation. Iain Anderson, the commonwealth ombudsman, said most
  wrongful detention cases were a result of errors previously known to Home
  Affairs and could have been avoided if existing policies and procedures were
  properly followed. The department accepted the recommendations. The NSW
  government is considering a temporary ban on e-bikes, e-scooters and other
  e-mobility devices on trains and metro services amid growing concerns about
  the fire safety risk of lithium-ion batteries. Officials will open a public
  feedback period on the matter for three weeks, beginning today, to get a
  “better understanding of how a temporary ban would impact e-micromobility
  users, and alternative options for safe use on public transport”. The proposed
  ban comes after several incidents on public transport overseas and a battery
  fire on a Melbourne metro train in March, as well as a fire in a lift at
  Blacktown station in Sydney in April. Officials say NSW Fire and Rescue has
  reported 183 lithium-ion battery fires so far this year, more than a third of
  which are linked to e-micromobility devices. NSW transport minister John
  Graham said: As the number of e-bikes and e-scooters in NSW surges past 1.3m,
  we need to find the right way to mitigate the fire risk on trains. The risk of
  a lithium battery fire on a train in a tunnel or in an underground station is
  very concerning and the safety of our passengers and staff is our number one
  priority. The ban would apply on carriages, platforms and station areas for
  Sydney Trains, Sydney Metro and NSW TrainLink services. Buses, light rail and
  ferries would be excluded as there is a greater ability to rapidly remove
  passengers in an incident. Mobility aids for disability purposes would also be
  excluded. ACTU will push for four-day work week ‘where appropriate’ at
  economic roundtable Unions are pushing for a shorter working week at next
  week’s economic summit, as the prime minister says there’s room for bold ideas
  at the roundtable, AAP report. The ACTU will call for a four-day week in
  sectors that can support it, arguing that this will allow workers to benefit
  from productivity gains and technological advances. It will further argue that
  reducing working hours, from a standard five days a week, is key to lifting
  living standards. The ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, said in a statement:
  Shorter working hours are good for both workers and employers. They deliver
  improved productivity and allow working people to live happier, healthier and
  more balanced lives. Fewer households falling behind on loan repayments,
  CommBank says Households have stopped falling further behind on loans over
  2025 and are hiking their savings and spending on nice-to-haves, according to
  Commonwealth Bank. More from Australia’s biggest bank’s financial results, out
  this morning: the share of customers behind on home loan payments by 90 days
  or more rose to 0.7% over the first half of 2025, but CommBank said that had
  now stopped rising. Easing pressure on mortgage holders helped the bank save
  $76m, with impaired or unpaid loans costing CBA $726m in the year to June,
  down from the previous year’s $802m. More customers are ahead on their minimum
  monthly loan repayments, with the share rising to 85% in June compared to just
  under 80% the previous year. CommBank’s chief executive, Matt Comyn, said:
  Pleasingly, many households have seen a rise in disposable incomes due to the
  recent relief from reduced interest rates, lower inflation and tax cuts.
  Sussan Ley says government’s algal bloom response has been ‘woefully
  inadequate’ Opposition leader Sussan Ley also spoke to ABC News this morning,
  saying she was disappointed with Watt’s remarks. Ley said: The response so far
  from the government has been woefully inadequate. This is a natural disaster
  and it is a national disaster … This needs a dedicated state and federal
  government approach that is for the longer term, because this is not just
  something that comes one day and goes the next. And our communities deserve so
  much better from their government. … It looks to me like the prime minister is
  ignoring regional communities, ignoring domestic issues. Environment minister
  says SA algal bloom ‘more like a drought’ with long-term impact, rather than
  natural disaster The environment minister, Murray Watt, said there is no doubt
  the ongoing algal bloom in South Australia is a “very severe environmental
  event,” but said while there have been growing calls to label it a natural
  disaster, the government was treating the bloom more like a long-running
  drought. Watt has stopped short of the declaration in recent weeks, despite
  expert calls that the bloom is one of the worst marine disaster “in living
  memory”. He told ABC News this morning the $14m in federal funding to help
  address it was akin to a package used during a longer-term phenomenon: On the
  natural disaster declaration, and I realise there’s been many calls for that
  to occur, this is much more like a drought, in the sense that it is a
  long-running event and builds up over time. We’re waiting for weather
  conditions to intervene before it ends and that’s quite different to what we
  think of as natural disaster and the rapid onset [events] like floods and
  cyclones and bushfires that come through an area, leave a trail of destruction
  and move on. That’s not the kind of situation we’re dealing with here and
  that’s why we’ve come up with a support package which is probably a bit more
  like how we respond to droughts with state and federal governments responding
  to thinking about the short-term needs and long-term needs. CommBank borrowers
  took out extra $34bn in home loans in last financial year Borrowers took out
  an additional $34bn in home loans, up 7% from June 2024 to June 2025. Personal
  loans also picked up by $400m. The bank delivered shareholders a dividend
  payout of $2.60 per share, to a total of $4.85 over the last 12 months, up
  from the $4.65 it paid in 2024. The value of CBA shares has risen greatly over
  the last 12 months, from $134 a year ago to nearly $180 today – one of the
  most overvalued stocks on the market, according to some analysts, with UBS
  last week saying it should be worth something more like $120. But CommBank
  said its success was Australia’s to share, noting in its annual report: CBA
  paid [in second half 2024 and first half 2025] dividends to over 800,000
  direct shareholders, indirectly benefitting over 13 million Australians
  through their superannuation. The Commonwealth Bank has recorded $10.25bn in
  annual cash profits – a 4% lift – and delivered a bumper $2.60 payout per
  share to shareholders. The gap between the interest CommBank pays deposit
  holders and the interest it receives from borrowers widened to a net interest
  margin of 2.08%, up from 1.99% over the year to June 2024. In its annual
  report released this morning, CommBank said the improvement mostly reflected a
  change in its investments and was partly squeezed by competition with other
  banks to offer good deposit interest rates. That saw the bank’s net interest
  margin narrow slightly for its household and business lending, by 0.03 and
  0.04 percentage points respectively. Australians deposited an additional $34bn
  in CommBank accounts over the year to June, with savings deposits up 10% over
  the year and transaction account deposits, which do not receive interest, up
  11%. Fatima Payman doesn’t regret leaving Labor over Palestine stance, and
  would not go back Independent senator Fatima Payman said she has let “bygones
  be bygones” after leaving Labor last year amid major disagreements over the
  government’s action on Palestine, but said she was hopeful after seeing
  Anthony Albanese say Australia would recognise a Palestinian state. Payman
  spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying the recognition should just be a
  first step, pointing to calls for targeted sanctions and further
  accountability. Payman said: It’s great to see that the government’s finally
  catching up with what’s morally right and politically necessary. It’s a
  monumental step, definitely long overdue, but we can’t stop at this. … I’ve
  let bygones be bygones. I have not regretted the decision of leaving the Labor
  party. It’s unfortunate that it, you know, the whole thing panned out the way
  it did. But I know that … I was on the right side of history. Host Sally Sara
  asked Payman if she would go back to the Labor party. “No”, Payman said. It’s
  ridiculous that it’s taken them this long. You know, symbolism matters, but
  saving lives matters more. Coalition will support roundtable ideas that
  ‘reduce red tape and regulation’, but there are limits James Paterson, the
  shadow finance minister, said the Coalition will support the Labor government
  if “good ideas” come out of the economic roundtable, saying those that “reduce
  red tape and regulation” would earn the opposition’s support. But Paterson
  told RN Breakfast that support was not endless: We’re open-minded about
  anything that can improve productivity because it is so critical to our
  prosperity as a country. Where we have reservations is if the government tries
  to do things it doesn’t have a mandate for because it didn’t earn it at the
  election. For example, increasing taxes. Labor didn’t tell anyone before the
  election that they would raise taxes, and a hand-picked roundtable of people
  in Canberra doesn’t provide them the mandate they failed to earn at the
  election. More from the incident at Sydney Airport this morning, as we
  reported earlier in the blog: The Australian Federal Police said a man has
  been arrested at Sydney Airport after an incident where a police firearm was
  discharged inside the T2 domestic terminal. An AFP spokesperson said the
  agency has launched an investigation into the incident and a crime scene has
  been established. There were no injuries and there is no ongoing threat to the
  public. Sydney Airport said earlier the airport is operating as normal.
  Chalmers says he is in complete agreement with PM on productivity roundtable
  Chalmers was asked about recent suggestions by Albanese that those hoping for
  dramatic reform from the roundtable should lower their expectations. The
  treasurer said he was completely aligned with the prime minister, saying the
  event next week would build on an already ambitious agenda: The point that the
  prime minister made last week is the same point that I have made, which is
  that this economic reform roundtable is not to make decisions, it’s to inform
  the government’s decisions. And that’s the point that we have made all along.
  We are aligned. We have an ambitious agenda that we’re focused on delivering,
  and this economic reform roundtable is a good opportunity to shake the tree
  for more ideas in our economy. And the people who criticise this process
  appear to be saying that we should consult less with the business community or
  the union movement or the community more broadly, experts and economists.
  Chalmers says rate cut ‘welcome relief’, but warns unpredictable economy must
  keep nation on its toes The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said yesterday’s interest
  rate cut is “welcome relief” to millions of Australians, saying he has
  confidence the country is on the “right track” addressing inflation and seeing
  real wages. Chalmers said while inflation had fallen dramatically in recent
  months, what he called “remarkable progress”, the treasury must remain “always
  vigilant” amid an unpredictable economy: We are never complacent about
  developments in the global economy. There is more than the usual amount of
  churn and change right now. It’s unpredictable, it’s volatile, it’s uncertain.
  And that’s why one of our key goals is to make our economy more resilient. We
  will do that by making it more productive over time. An arrest has been made
  after an incident at Sydney airport this morning. An airport spokesperson said
  there were no injuries, noting the facility was operating as normal: Sydney
  Airport is currently assisting Australian Federal Police following an incident
  earlier this morning. No injuries occurred as a result of the incident. An
  arrest has been made and the airport is operating normally. We’ll have more
  details from the AFP soon. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he is up
  for “big reform” as his government heads into a long-promised productivity
  roundtable next week. Albanese spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying his
  government had a strong agenda of promises from the last election, but said
  there is plenty of room for more ideas. I had a really successful meeting with
  some business leaders on Monday evening in Melbourne. And some of the ideas
  that were kicked around there are really positive. They’ll feed into our
  processes. And that is how good government should operate. We’re an inclusive
  government. We are up for consultation and we’re up for ideas. RN host Sabra
  Lane pressed the prime minister about how big the ideas could get, or if the
  status quo would remain. Albanese replied: I’m up for big reform. … We are up
  for big reform, whether it’s strengthening Medicare, the changes to childcare,
  the benefit to education. Good morning, Nick Visser here to take over the
  blog. Thanks to the always great Martin Farrer. Let’s get to it. Tasmanian
  Greens declare they are unable ‘at this point’ to support state Labor
  Tasmania’s minority Liberal government appears increasingly likely to continue
  ruling, with the Greens declaring they are unable to “at this point” support
  Labor. The July 19 state election returned another hung parliament, with the
  Liberals (14 seats) finishing closer than Labor (10) to the 18 seats required
  for majority. Jeremy Rockliff, the state Liberal leader, has been reappointed
  premier but both major parties have been trying to garner support from a
  crossbench containing five Greens, five independents and one Shooters, Fishers
  and Farmers MP. Labor’s leader, Dean Winter, has held talks with independents
  but has continually ruled out “doing a deal” with the Greens, despite needing
  their numbers to govern. Winter has flagged a no-confidence motion in Rockliff
  when parliament resumes on the 18th. Winter and Greens leader Rosalie Woodruff
  held a formal meeting on Tuesday. “At this stage we cannot have any confidence
  in the proposed motion to make Dean Winter the premier of Tasmania in
  parliament,” Woodruff said. Mark Latham is set to defend claims of homosexual
  vilification against a fellow parliamentarian, Australian Associated Press
  reports. The former federal Labor leader is due to give evidence at a civil
  tribunal in Sydney today after the NSW independent MP Alex Greenwich accused
  him yesterday of having an “abusive obsession” with him. The case relates to a
  sexually explicit tweet the federal court has previously ruled as defamatory
  and subsequent media appearances made by Latham, who sits as an independent in
  the state parliament. Greenwich has sued Latham for homosexual vilification
  and workplace harassment in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The
  online sparring match between the two politicians followed violent protests
  outside a church in Sydney’s south-west, where Latham was giving a
  pre-election speech in March 2023. About 250 mostly male counter-protesters
  violently attacked police and 15 LGBTQI protesters. Here’s our report on
  yesterday’s hearing: Belinda Allen, a senior economist at the Commonwealth
  Bank, expects the RBA to wait until November before cutting again – but that
  could shift depending on how the data unfolds, Australian Associated Press
  reports. “The governor did not rule out back‑to‑back cuts. Inflation appears
  under control, so any acceleration of the cutting cycle we expect would have
  to be driven by a deterioration in the labour market,” she said. Allen said
  the most important data readings before the next meeting would be labour force
  surveys released on Thursday and in September, as well as economic growth
  figures for the June quarter to be released on September 3. RBA staff lowered
  their GDP growth forecasts as they pared back their expectations for trend
  productivity growth from one per cent to 0.7% per year. We’re reporting today
  on how borrowers might have to wait a few weeks to get the benefit of
  yesterday’s cut. Overnight the foreign minister, Penny Wong, signed Australia
  to a joint statement with 29 international partners decrying the humanitarian
  situation in Gaza. It said, in part: The humanitarian suffering in Gaza has
  reached unimaginable levels. Famine is unfolding before our eyes. Urgent
  action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation. We call on the government
  of Israel to provide authorisation for all international NGO aid shipments and
  to unblock essential humanitarian actors from operating. All crossings and
  routes must be used to allow a flood of aid into Gaza, including food,
  nutrition supplies, shelter, fuel, clean water, medicine and medical
  equipment. Lethal force must not be used at distribution sites, and civilians,
  humanitarians and medical workers must be protected. The statement was signed
  by two EU representatives as well as the foreign ministers of: Australia,
  Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland,
  Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,
  Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.
  Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top
  overnight stories and then it’ll be Nick Visser to take over. Mark Latham will
  appear at a tribunal in Sydney today to defend claims of homosexual
  vilification against his fellow NSW MP. It comes after Sydney MP Alex
  Greenwich told the tribunal yesterday that Latham had an “abusive obsession
  with me”. A leading bank economist thinks that the Reserve Bank will wait
  until November before cutting rates again after yesterday’s decision to reduce
  the cash rate by another 0.25% signalled some relief for borrowers. More
  coming up. And Australia has signed a joint statement on behalf of 29
  international partners saying the humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached
  “unimaginable” levels and urgent action is needed to halt and reverse
  starvation. It calls on Israel to facilitate a “flood” of aid into the
  territory.

We will wrap up the live blog here. This is what made the news: The foreign minister, Penny Wong, signed Australia to a joint statement with 29 international partners decrying the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Belinda Allen, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank, expects the RBA to wait until November before cutting again – but that could depend on how the data unfolds. The Commonwealth Bank recorded $10.25bn in annual cash profits – up 4% – and delivered a bumper $2.60 payout per share to shareholders. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he is up for “big reform” as his government heads into a long-promised productivity roundtable next week. The Australian Federal Police said a man was arrested at Sydney Airport after an incident where a police firearm was discharged inside the T2 domestic terminal. The NSW government is considering a temporary ban on e-bikes, e-scooters and other e-mobility devices on trains and metro services amid growing concerns about the fire risk of lithium-ion batteries. The commonwealth ombudsman has found the Department of Home Affairs wrongfully detained 11 people in the past year, including an Australian citizen and another person improperly held for 18 months. David Southwick, the Coalition police spokesperson, described the Victorian government as “all talk and no action” when it came to introducing tougher protest laws. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers said the government was focused on other measures when asked about the unions’ suggestion of a four-day work week. Until tomorrow, enjoy your evening. Ombudsman warns more resources needed for investigating whistleblower complaints The Commonwealth Ombudsman says his agency needs more resourcing to investigate complaints made by whistleblowers about the handling of their disclosures. The federal government’s whistleblowing system is complicated but, put simply, a public servant wanting to shed light on potential wrongdoing has to submit a public interest disclosure (PID) to their agency’s PID officer. The PID is assessed by the officer to determine whether it’s valid, and then allocated for investigation. If a discloser is not satisfied with the investigation, it can go to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In cases where a PID officer identifies a conflict of interest – for example, allegations against the agency’s senior bosses – it can also be referred to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. It’s a regime that’s been heavily criticised since it was introduced because many would-be whistleblowers get sucked into a bureaucratic and legally technical blackhole. The ombudsman, Iain Anderson, described it this afternoon in a parliamentary inquiry as an “overly complex, overly prescriptive regime” in need of serious simplification. But perhaps the most interesting revelation was that the ombudsman only has 1.5 staff members on hand to deal with any complaints. While Anderson admitted the number can “fluctuate”, he also conceded “it probably wouldn’t have been more than four or five at the most”. Meanwhile, Anderson noted the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption had about 25 staff to handle referral and investigation complaints. Tim Wilson says wages growth is coming from the public sector The shadow small business and jobs minister, Tim Wilson, has downplayed the wage growth figures released today, saying public sector wage growth is “borrowing from future generations”. He told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing: This is a problem with this government; they are spending more either directly on public sector jobs or they are building out a private economy dependent on public expenditure, not on a long-term, sustainable private sector-led economy that expands the economic pie that grows in the interests of all Australians. The host, Patricia Karvelas pointed out that it was not “factually correct” that wage rises had been achieved from borrowing. He said the Coalition wouldn’t say whether it approved what might come out of the economic roundtable until the government’s agenda was clear, and he accused unions of “gaslighting” workers by proposing a four-day work week that had already been shot down by the government. He argued it was a piece of “theatre” that would let the government look sensible by rejecting it. Hello, Josh Taylor here taking over from Natasha May for the remainder of the day. Rishworth: Australia’s Palestine recognition decision is about ‘excluding Hamas from the process’ Asked about whether she is worried about comments made by the terrorist group Hamas welcoming Australia’s recognition of Palestine, Rishworth says: Hamas is going to use whatever they can to promote propaganda. They are a terrorist organisation … This move is about excluding Hamas from the process. Rishworth: ‘flexibility’ key to government’s stance on work/life balance Asked about the ACTU’s proposal for a four-day working week, Rishworth says the laws the government has passed already allow for flexibility. She says flexibility has driven the government’s position on work-from-home and requests for flexible arrangements, including hours and location for caring responsibilities. “It is about finding a better balance.” Rishworth has shied away from saying if she agrees with the ACTU’s position that a four-day working week could “deliver improved productivity and allow working people to live happier, healthier and more balanced lives”. What is key to the laws that we have passed is around flexibility. Employment minister says enterprise bargaining is driving wages growth, productivity Amanda Rishworth, the minister for employment and workplace relations, has been speaking on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing about wages data released today. She says the re-invigoration of enterprise bargaining is driving wage and productivity increases with a “record number of employees covered by enterprise bargaining”. Rishworth says it is not only public sector growth that is responsible for “broad based growth”. AFP charge man after disturbance at Sydney airport that saw police firearm discharged A 41-year-old man was charged after an incident at Sydney airport this morning that saw the discharge of a police firearm, as we reported earlier. Australian Federal Police said they responded to the airport’s T2 domestic terminal amid reports a man was acting suspiciously. When officers tried to speak with him, they allege he became verbally and physically aggressive and they arrested him. AFP acting commander Scott Raven said during a press conference the firearm was discharged during that arrest: During his arrest, the AFP firearm was unintentionally discharged. The circumstances of how the firearm, which was a short barrelled rifle, was discharged is now subject to an internal investigation. Thankfully, there were no injuries as a result of the incident. The man has been charged with one count of obstructing or resisting a commonwealth official and one count of creating a disturbance at an airport. The first penalty faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison for a first offence, and the disturbance charge faces a maximum fine of $3,300. He has been granted conditional bail and will appear before court in Sydney on 1 September. If you want to read more about the news we brought you earlier that Home Affairs wrongfully detained an Australian citizen, Tory Shepherd has the full story: The opposition, leader Sussan Ley, has called on the prime minister to urgently rethink his decision to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN next month after Hamaspraised the decision. Ley told Sky News a short while ago: And now it’s quite clear that the prime minister is completely out of his depth. We have one of the co-founders of Hamas – a listed terrorist organisation – praising our prime minister today, in fact, lauding his political courage. Now the endorsement of his decision by a listed terrorist organisation is exactly the reason the Coalition has opposed it and would revoke it in government. It’s up to the prime minister now to explain what he does next. Does he stick with this process? Does he recognise? But he needs to rethink it. “The prime minister’s eating ice-creams in Queensland, making jokes. Meanwhile, a listed terrorist organisation overseas is cheering on his foreign policy. I think that tells all Australians he has got it wrong. And it really is time for him to rethink this urgently.” Huge lobbying action at Victorian parliament by teachers today If you’re around Victoria’s parliament today and wondering why there are hundreds of teachers in the corridors, it’s part of what’s been described as the “single largest lobbying event ever” held in the building. The Australian Education Union brought more than 100 public school teachers, school leaders and education support staff to hold 45 meetings with Victorian Labor MPs. They’re unhappy the government has pushed back its commitment to fully fund the Gonski reforms by three years, which effectively cuts $2.4bn from public schools. AEU Victorian branch president, Justin Mullaly, says Victorian public schools “are the only schools in the nation in this situation”. He says: Victorian public schools are the lowest funded in Australia and every school in the state is affected – that means the learning and wellbeing of every student is impacted. Full funding delivered without delay would enable schools to better meet the diverse needs of all students, improve learning outcomes, and guarantee that every student in every classroom has a fully qualified permanent teacher. That’s all from me, thanks for sticking with us. Natasha May will be your guide as the news rolls in. Take care. Victoria premier also says four-day week not on her radar The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, was asked earlier to weigh in on the ACTU’s plans to propose a four-day working week at the federal government’s productivity roundtable. How would this affect her plan to enshrine the right to work from home two days a week? Allan told reporters: That’s not something that we’re currently considering. My focus, in terms of supporting flexibility in workplace arrangements that are good for workers, good for families and good for the economy, is supporting more working from home. Power returning to NSW south coast after Telstra outage And that Telstra outage should be over soon. Telstra just had this to say: The issue was caused by an onsite power issue. Power is now restored and we’ve seen services progressively coming back online since 1:45pm. Mobile services are now fully restored and most NBN and fixed services are restored, we are working on full restoration for the remaining small number of fixed services. Thanks to everyone for their patience while we got this sorted. Telstra outage affecting more than 100,000 services on NSW south coast Telstra says a large outage is affecting more than 100,000 services, including mobile phones, NBN, ADSL and the public telephone network, along NSW’s south coast. The company says it will update the situationby 4.30pm. Hamas welcomes Australia’s decision to recognise Palestinian state as Labor maintains group will have no role in future leadership Hamas praised Australia’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN next month in a statement to The Sydney Morning Herald. Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a co-founder of the terrorist group, said the move was an “important step” for people in Gaza. He told the Herald: We welcome Australia’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine, and consider it an important step towards achieving justice for our people and securing their legitimate rights. This position reflects political courage and a commitment to the values of justice and the right of peoples to self-determination. We call on all countries, especially those that believe in freedom and human dignity, to follow Australia’s example and translate their positions into practical steps to support the Palestinian people and end their suffering under occupation. A government spokesperson responded to the statement in remarks to the SMH, saying Hamas “always tries to manipulate facts for their own propaganda,” adding media has a “responsibility to make professional judgments to not promote propaganda of terrorist organisations to get cynical headlines”. What Australia has done is contribute international momentum towards a two-state solution, which Hamas opposes. We are supporting the Arab League’s efforts to isolate Hamas. Treasurer Jim Chalmers maintained earlier this afternoon that Australia would work to ensure Hamas has “absolutely no role” in the future leadership of a Palestinian state. Dead dolphin washes up on Adelaide beach amid algal bloom An adult common dolphin washed up dead on a popular Adelaide beach on Wednesday morning, wildlife officials said. South Australia is reeling from an algal bloom and officials said a necropsy will be done to investigate the animal’s cause of death, including any effects from the bloom. The dolphin was found on Henley beach. A spokesperson for SA’s department for environment and water said in a statement officials do not believe marine mammals are at particular risk from the event: Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins and seals are not believed to be at immediate risk from the algal bloom as it is believed only animals with gills are at immediate direct risk. The significance of the algal bloom effects on the availability of species that marine mammals prey on is not yet clear. The death of marine mammals, while unfortunate, is not an uncommon occurrence, particularly during the winter months. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said in a statement on Instagram: Our oceans and beaches are sick and dying. This is a national disaster devastating our communities and environment, and it requires a national response. South Australia can’t manage this climate catastrophe on our own. Our communities, businesses and tourism industry need support. Bystander at Sydney airport recounts helping officers subdue man during incident this morning A bystander at Sydney airport this morning described the moment Australian Federal Police officers arrested a man before a police firearm discharged, as reported earlier by Guardian Australia. William, who did not give his last name, told 2GB in an interview he and his travel companion were in the airport’s T2 domestic terminal when the arrest took place. The man, who said he is a former NSW Police dog handler, helped restrain the unnamed person amid a terminal “full of people”. William told 2GB: We saw this fellow struggling with the two AFP officers. It’s gone to the ground. The AFP officer’s long firearm has gone to the ground and was underneath the fellow. As we went to restrain him, the shot has been discharged. William added that he jumped into action without thinking, saying: “You just do. When these things happen. I didn’t really think.” Chalmers was asked about the ACTU’s plans to propose a four-day working week at the productivity roundtable. The treasurer said while he had heard the proposal, the government was focused on other measures: Our interest here is in making sure that people can balance their work and family responsibilities. That’s what motivates our position on work-from-home and some of these other contentious areas in recent times. We haven’t been working up a policy for a four-day week. That hasn’t been our focus. Our focus in industrial relations has been abolishing non-compete clauses, protecting penalty rates, extending paid parental leave … That’s our industrial relations agenda, and what motivates our agenda. Chalmers says government has always been clear on calls for hostages to be released Treasurer Jim Chalmers was just asked about the Israeli embassy’s statement during a press conference in Canberra. Chalmers said the government had always been “very clear on our position on the release of the hostages”, saying the recent decision to recognise a Palestinian state was about seeing a two-state solution that excluded Hamas from leadership. Chalmers said: First of all we’ve been very clear on our position of the release of the hostages. The announcement the prime minister and foreign minister made this week is about isolating and excluding Hamas from the future leadership of Palestine, a state of Palestine. We see recognition making our contribution to the international progress and momentum behind this question as an important step towards a two-state solution. And a two-state solution is all about making sure that families in Israel and in Palestine can raise their kids in peace. Hamas will have absolutely no role in that. Israeli embassy says Australia should up demands for release of hostages The Israeli embassy in Australia said it was deeply troubled a recent joint statement condemning the humanitarian crisis in Gaza only had “vague wording” calling of the release of hostages held by Hamas since the 7 October attack in Israel. Australia was among a group of 29 signatories calling for urgent action to end starvation and the blocking of aid into Gaza yesterday. The statement urged “immediate, permanent and concrete steps must be taken to facilitate safe, large-scale access for the UN, international NGOs and humanitarian partners”. It ended with a call for a ceasefire to end the war and for “hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered”. The Israeli embassy said while it shared concern for the humanitarian suffering in Gaza, “it is deeply troubling that the plight of Israeli hostages, men and women, held by the Hamas terror organisation is reduced to a single line at the bottom of the statement,” adding: These innocent civilians are starving in underground tunnels … We have yet to hear the Australian government speak with the same urgency about their humanitarian situation. Pressure must be placed squarely on Hamas to release them immediately, as their continued captivity is a grave violation of international law and basic human decency. In recent days both prime minister Anthony Albanese and foreign minister Penny Wong have repeatedly stressed the need to see all remaining hostages released after announcing Australia would soon recognise a Palestinian state. David Southwick, the Coalition police spokesperson, described the government as “all talk and no action” when it came to introducing tougher protest laws. He told reporters outside parliament: We keep hearing words from the premier – strong words, no action, and then winding back those words and watering them down and giving us weak laws. That’s not what Victoria expects. We need tougher laws and consequences … We can’t wait till the end of the year. That’s just ridiculous. But the government’s walk back was welcomed by the Greens leader, Ellen Sandell, who said the government had “really misread the Victoria public” when it floated the “draconian laws to crack down on people’s right to peaceful protest”. She said: The Victorian people know that the right to peacefully protest when you see something that is unjust is a fundamental right in a democracy and the Victorian people don’t want to see the Victorian Labor government go down the path of Trump’s America or even the New South Wales government that are trying to crack down on the fundamental right to peaceful protest. We’re really glad that it looks like Jacinta Allan might have to go back to the drawing board. Reactions coming in after reports Victoria will scale back proposed anti-protest laws There’s been a lot of reaction to our story this morning that the Victorian government will scale back its proposed anti-protest laws – including an outright ban on face masks at protests and attachment devices. While the attorney general, Sonya Kilkenny, would not confirm details in the report, she acknowledged that any laws on face coverings at protests would need to allow for their legitimate use. She said: There are always legitimate reasons to do certain things and these are matters that need to be taken into account. There’s nothing unique in drafting and designing these laws. That’s why it’s important to engage and consult and listen really carefully to those who are impacted [and to] Victoria police. The premier, Jacinta Allan, also admitted to difficulty legislating “safe access” areas around places of worship, which she had committed to introducing back in December: There’s clearly some complexity with those sorts of laws but we are examining options. PM welcomes wage growth figures On the news out of the Australian Bureau of Statistics that the wage price index rose 0.8% in June, with 3.4% annual growth, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said it was “great news”. We inherited a position where inflation was at 6%, real wages were falling, interest rates began to increase. Now what we have is inflation down to 2.1%, unemployment is relatively low at 4.3%, we have interest rates that yesterday decreased for the third time this year and we have real wages increasing. That is a good thing. That means increased living standards and is I think welcome, just like the interest rate decision. We are working very hard … inflation [is] down, interest rates [are] falling, real wages [are] increasing, unemployment [is] steady. That is the envy of the Western world in terms of economic outcomes that has been produced by the hard work that Australians have been producing, it is I think one of the reasons why we received the backing for a second term to continue our approach to these measures. Finally, Albanese said he is available to meet with the US president, Donald Trump, at very short notice at any time and the government has been engaged with American colleagues on a ministerial level. He said there have been three phone calls between him and Trump, including “a very warm” one after the election. Albanese asked about EV road tax, four-day work week Turning to other issues, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is asked about the potential for electric vehicle road users to be charged a tax. Albanese notes it has been an issue that has been discussed for a decade, and there is a need for money “to ensure roads are adequate”. What we need to do is to work those issues through and to come up with a realistic plan that can be implemented, and we’ll await those discussions. I know Catherine King will obviously play a role in that as the transport minister. On the union proposal for a four-day work week, Albanese said the government has no plans, but they’re welcome to put forward the idea. The ACTU, of course, is entitled to put forward whatever ideas it likes. But that doesn’t mean, as I’ve said, that it’s government policy because someone put forward an idea. Albanese said it was regrettable the Queensland government had pulled out of the Australian Battery Industrialisation Centre but said there are opportunities in Queensland, and he has a constructive relationship with the state government. Recognition to build on momentum for Middle East peace, PM says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, wouldn’t comment on whether more protests around Gaza should go ahead, stating it’s worked out by state governments, and he won’t speak for the Queensland police in regards to a planned Brisbane protest. He said the Australian government is “not writing Middle East policy in a backyard here in Brisbane” but said the government is trying to build on momentum for peace. People are watching what is happening in Gaza. They’re watching it playing out. The catastrophe for humanity that is being played out there. And you can either watch or you can do what we can, which is to be a part of momentum - we’re not big players in the Middle East. What we are, though, what we can do is to add our voice to those who are saying: ‘Enough is enough,’ and we need to advance the long-term peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. Too many innocent lives have been lost. PM holds press conference in Brisbane The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been taking questions at a press conference in Brisbane over Australia’s move to recognise Palestine. He has repeated that Hamas can play no role in a future Palestinian state, and the Arab League and other countries in the region have made it clear that Hamas must have no role, and must lay down its weapons. Asked if he is concerned that recogntion will harm Australia’s relationship with the United States, Albanese says Donald Trump has been an advocate for peace in the Middle East. What is a way forward for peace and security after 77 years of conflict? The whole world, and indeed Australia, has been committed to a bipartisan support to a two-state solution for a long period of time. One of those states is Israel, the other is Palestine. In order for Palestinians to be able to satisfy their legitimate aspirations for their own state, Israel must be assured of security as well, and that is what the world is working towards. NSW police arrest three on allegations of staging vehicles for a planned public shooting NSW police have charged two men and a teenager in Sydney on allegations they were staging vehicles for a planned shooting in a public place. Officials conducted a high-risk vehicle stop of a car in Sydney’s Blacktown shortly after midnight on Wednesday morning, using beanbag rounds and a police dog to intercept the vehicle. A man, 21, and a teen, 17, were arrested, with the older man sustaining a dog bite. Officer arrested another man, 39, during a stop of an SUV in Granville around the same time. Police later executed a search warrant at a home in Willmot, where they allegedly seized a loaded revolver, cash and electronics. Police have since alleged the 39-year-old and 17-year-old were involved in the staging of vehicles for the planned public shooting. The man, 39, has been charged with multiple counts including recklessly dealing with the proceeds of crime, possessing an unauthorised pistol and driving a vehicle without a licence, among other charges. The 17-year-old has been charged with two counts of driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner and the participation in a criminal group contributing to criminal activity, among other charges. The pair were refused bail and will appear in separate courts today. The 21-year-old was issued a breach of bail and a court notice for driving while disqualified. Extra money largely going to savings and offset accounts More from CommBank: Households are overwhelmingly sending that extra income to their savings and mortgage offset accounts. Customers under 55 had all been cutting back on their savings in the three months to June 2024. Over the same period this year, they all hiked savings, while customers aged 55 and up have hiked their savings even more. Young Australians have also hiked their spend on nonessential goods, with under-35-year-olds boosting discretionary spending where they had been cutting back a year ago. That age group also picked up their spending on essential goods – reflecting just how restrained younger workers had been a year ago when underlying inflation was still nearly 4%. Victoria premier says working from home can help households with ‘precious time’ The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, held another press conference on her plan to enshrine the right to work from home two days a week. Yesterday, she announced consultation on the plan had opened. Today she was joined with members of the plumber’s union to speak about how working from home benefits even those who are not able to. Allan says: Not everyone can work from home, and I think the plumbers here demonstrate that … They’re married to someone who can work from home, they love someone who can work from home. She says working from home two days a week saves families on tolls, fuel and parking, helping the household budget and giving “precious time” back to spend together instead of on the commute. Allan says in just 24 hours more than 6,000 people have responded to the survey on the Engage Victoria website. Robodebt whistleblower says she has paid ‘very high price’ for speaking up A robodebt whistleblower has warned of the “scrap heap” she continues to experience years after first raising the alarm on the unlawful scheme that affected millions of Australians. Jeannie-Marie Blake, a former Centrelink employee, continued to work at Services Australia years after making complaints about the “income averaging” debt calculation program, but told a parliamentary committee this morning she ultimately left the role due to feeling extra “scrutiny” and “pressure” internally following her appearance at the robodebt royal commission. Blake said: A decade since I first blew the whistle on robodebt, and over two years since I gave evidence at the royal commission, I’m still suffering. I was so traumatised by my experience that I’m on workers compensation, barely subsisting on a fraction of my former salary. Ultimately, my family and my career have paid the very high price of speaking up. Meanwhile, those most responsible for robodebt have faced no real consequences … Ultimately, robodebt was stopped, but we’re left here on a scrap heap, paying the high price for our sacrifice, a sacrifice that I made in the public’s best interest. I’m not the only one. E-bike fire on a Melbourne train in March prompts caution around lithium-ion batteries In relation to the news about NSW considering a temporary ban on e-bikes and e-scooters on trains and Metro services: Melbourne has seen that risk first-hand. An e-bike caught fire inside a Metro train carriage in March, prompting evacuations and a response from Fire Rescue Victoria. The deputy commissioner for the service, Josh Fischer, said at the time: Time and time again we are seeing incidents involving lithium-ion batteries. … Interstate and internationally we are continuing to see that risk grow. Victoria is set to introduce new regulations banning e-scooters and e-bikes on trains and coaches, with only foldable e-bikes and e-scooters allowed on trams and PTV buses. Those draft regulations are set to come into effect on 30 September. Public consultation on the changes ends on 18 August. Opposition leader tells prime minister to fix domestic issues, not global conflicts Anthony Albanese should be focused on the kitchen table, not a negotiating table in the Middle East, Sussan Ley says. In op-eds and a series of media interviews this morning, the opposition leader took aim at the government, saying Labor had lost sight of the cost of living crisis for families after the government announced it would recognise a Palestinian state at the upcoming UN general assembly. The Coalition said yesterday it would reverse that recognition if it won government. In an op-ed for the Herald Sun, Ley wrote: These are serious matters, but Australians expect their Prime Minister’s first priority to be the kitchen tables of this country, not negotiating tables 12,000km away. Day after day, he appears fixated on one foreign policy issue to the exclusion of everything else. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank reduced the interest rate to 3.6%, the third interest rate drop this year, after 13 consecutive rate rises. It also downgraded its long-term outlook for Australia’s productivity growth. Parliamentary committee investigates creation of whistleblower protection agency A parliamentary committee is looking into the creation of a whistleblower protection agency this morning. Crossbenchers David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie introduced a bill which would create a new independent body to offer support and advice to public servants wanting to come forward to the National Anti-Corruption Commission (Nacc) or within their agencies about suspected misconduct within the government. In its first term, the Albanese government said it would consider creating a protection body following the Nacc’s opening, but little progress has been made. Jeannie-Marie Blake, a former Centrelink worker who raised the alarm on the illegal robodebt scheme, spoke of the need for such a body to give whistleblowers confidence to come forward. Blake said: When I and others raised concerns, we were met with a stark message: resign, transfer or comply. The message was as blunt as that: ‘shut up or leave’. Our concerns were ignored, and instead, we received threatening communications, performance targets, threats of underperformance, Code of Conduct breaches were used to suppress dissent, daily emails reminded us that if we were to speak outside our team to anyone about our work, we could be terminated. There was no safe, independent mechanism for staff to report concerns without fears of reprisals. If such a body had existed, I believe many more staff would have spoken out, and robodebt may have been stopped before it had even started. Read more about Jeannie-Marie Blake’s story here: The commonwealth ombudsman has found the Department of Home Affairs wrongfully detained 11 people in the past year, including an Australian citizen and another person improperly held for 18 months. In a report released on Wednesday, the ombudsman found that only one of the people wrongfully detained had made a civil claim against the government. It made three recommendations, including that the department provide each “affected individual” with a personal apology, including an acknowledgment of wrongdoing and “assurance as to remedial actions the Department has taken/intends to take to ensure these errors do not occur in future”, and information about how to apply for compensation. Iain Anderson, the commonwealth ombudsman, said most wrongful detention cases were a result of errors previously known to Home Affairs and could have been avoided if existing policies and procedures were properly followed. The department accepted the recommendations. The NSW government is considering a temporary ban on e-bikes, e-scooters and other e-mobility devices on trains and metro services amid growing concerns about the fire safety risk of lithium-ion batteries. Officials will open a public feedback period on the matter for three weeks, beginning today, to get a “better understanding of how a temporary ban would impact e-micromobility users, and alternative options for safe use on public transport”. The proposed ban comes after several incidents on public transport overseas and a battery fire on a Melbourne metro train in March, as well as a fire in a lift at Blacktown station in Sydney in April. Officials say NSW Fire and Rescue has reported 183 lithium-ion battery fires so far this year, more than a third of which are linked to e-micromobility devices. NSW transport minister John Graham said: As the number of e-bikes and e-scooters in NSW surges past 1.3m, we need to find the right way to mitigate the fire risk on trains. The risk of a lithium battery fire on a train in a tunnel or in an underground station is very concerning and the safety of our passengers and staff is our number one priority. The ban would apply on carriages, platforms and station areas for Sydney Trains, Sydney Metro and NSW TrainLink services. Buses, light rail and ferries would be excluded as there is a greater ability to rapidly remove passengers in an incident. Mobility aids for disability purposes would also be excluded. ACTU will push for four-day work week ‘where appropriate’ at economic roundtable Unions are pushing for a shorter working week at next week’s economic summit, as the prime minister says there’s room for bold ideas at the roundtable, AAP report. The ACTU will call for a four-day week in sectors that can support it, arguing that this will allow workers to benefit from productivity gains and technological advances. It will further argue that reducing working hours, from a standard five days a week, is key to lifting living standards. The ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, said in a statement: Shorter working hours are good for both workers and employers. They deliver improved productivity and allow working people to live happier, healthier and more balanced lives. Fewer households falling behind on loan repayments, CommBank says Households have stopped falling further behind on loans over 2025 and are hiking their savings and spending on nice-to-haves, according to Commonwealth Bank. More from Australia’s biggest bank’s financial results, out this morning: the share of customers behind on home loan payments by 90 days or more rose to 0.7% over the first half of 2025, but CommBank said that had now stopped rising. Easing pressure on mortgage holders helped the bank save $76m, with impaired or unpaid loans costing CBA $726m in the year to June, down from the previous year’s $802m. More customers are ahead on their minimum monthly loan repayments, with the share rising to 85% in June compared to just under 80% the previous year. CommBank’s chief executive, Matt Comyn, said: Pleasingly, many households have seen a rise in disposable incomes due to the recent relief from reduced interest rates, lower inflation and tax cuts. Sussan Ley says government’s algal bloom response has been ‘woefully inadequate’ Opposition leader Sussan Ley also spoke to ABC News this morning, saying she was disappointed with Watt’s remarks. Ley said: The response so far from the government has been woefully inadequate. This is a natural disaster and it is a national disaster … This needs a dedicated state and federal government approach that is for the longer term, because this is not just something that comes one day and goes the next. And our communities deserve so much better from their government. … It looks to me like the prime minister is ignoring regional communities, ignoring domestic issues. Environment minister says SA algal bloom ‘more like a drought’ with long-term impact, rather than natural disaster The environment minister, Murray Watt, said there is no doubt the ongoing algal bloom in South Australia is a “very severe environmental event,” but said while there have been growing calls to label it a natural disaster, the government was treating the bloom more like a long-running drought. Watt has stopped short of the declaration in recent weeks, despite expert calls that the bloom is one of the worst marine disaster “in living memory”. He told ABC News this morning the $14m in federal funding to help address it was akin to a package used during a longer-term phenomenon: On the natural disaster declaration, and I realise there’s been many calls for that to occur, this is much more like a drought, in the sense that it is a long-running event and builds up over time. We’re waiting for weather conditions to intervene before it ends and that’s quite different to what we think of as natural disaster and the rapid onset [events] like floods and cyclones and bushfires that come through an area, leave a trail of destruction and move on. That’s not the kind of situation we’re dealing with here and that’s why we’ve come up with a support package which is probably a bit more like how we respond to droughts with state and federal governments responding to thinking about the short-term needs and long-term needs. CommBank borrowers took out extra $34bn in home loans in last financial year Borrowers took out an additional $34bn in home loans, up 7% from June 2024 to June 2025. Personal loans also picked up by $400m. The bank delivered shareholders a dividend payout of $2.60 per share, to a total of $4.85 over the last 12 months, up from the $4.65 it paid in 2024. The value of CBA shares has risen greatly over the last 12 months, from $134 a year ago to nearly $180 today – one of the most overvalued stocks on the market, according to some analysts, with UBS last week saying it should be worth something more like $120. But CommBank said its success was Australia’s to share, noting in its annual report: CBA paid [in second half 2024 and first half 2025] dividends to over 800,000 direct shareholders, indirectly benefitting over 13 million Australians through their superannuation. The Commonwealth Bank has recorded $10.25bn in annual cash profits – a 4% lift – and delivered a bumper $2.60 payout per share to shareholders. The gap between the interest CommBank pays deposit holders and the interest it receives from borrowers widened to a net interest margin of 2.08%, up from 1.99% over the year to June 2024. In its annual report released this morning, CommBank said the improvement mostly reflected a change in its investments and was partly squeezed by competition with other banks to offer good deposit interest rates. That saw the bank’s net interest margin narrow slightly for its household and business lending, by 0.03 and 0.04 percentage points respectively. Australians deposited an additional $34bn in CommBank accounts over the year to June, with savings deposits up 10% over the year and transaction account deposits, which do not receive interest, up 11%. Fatima Payman doesn’t regret leaving Labor over Palestine stance, and would not go back Independent senator Fatima Payman said she has let “bygones be bygones” after leaving Labor last year amid major disagreements over the government’s action on Palestine, but said she was hopeful after seeing Anthony Albanese say Australia would recognise a Palestinian state. Payman spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying the recognition should just be a first step, pointing to calls for targeted sanctions and further accountability. Payman said: It’s great to see that the government’s finally catching up with what’s morally right and politically necessary. It’s a monumental step, definitely long overdue, but we can’t stop at this. … I’ve let bygones be bygones. I have not regretted the decision of leaving the Labor party. It’s unfortunate that it, you know, the whole thing panned out the way it did. But I know that … I was on the right side of history. Host Sally Sara asked Payman if she would go back to the Labor party. “No”, Payman said. It’s ridiculous that it’s taken them this long. You know, symbolism matters, but saving lives matters more. Coalition will support roundtable ideas that ‘reduce red tape and regulation’, but there are limits James Paterson, the shadow finance minister, said the Coalition will support the Labor government if “good ideas” come out of the economic roundtable, saying those that “reduce red tape and regulation” would earn the opposition’s support. But Paterson told RN Breakfast that support was not endless: We’re open-minded about anything that can improve productivity because it is so critical to our prosperity as a country. Where we have reservations is if the government tries to do things it doesn’t have a mandate for because it didn’t earn it at the election. For example, increasing taxes. Labor didn’t tell anyone before the election that they would raise taxes, and a hand-picked roundtable of people in Canberra doesn’t provide them the mandate they failed to earn at the election. More from the incident at Sydney Airport this morning, as we reported earlier in the blog: The Australian Federal Police said a man has been arrested at Sydney Airport after an incident where a police firearm was discharged inside the T2 domestic terminal. An AFP spokesperson said the agency has launched an investigation into the incident and a crime scene has been established. There were no injuries and there is no ongoing threat to the public. Sydney Airport said earlier the airport is operating as normal. Chalmers says he is in complete agreement with PM on productivity roundtable Chalmers was asked about recent suggestions by Albanese that those hoping for dramatic reform from the roundtable should lower their expectations. The treasurer said he was completely aligned with the prime minister, saying the event next week would build on an already ambitious agenda: The point that the prime minister made last week is the same point that I have made, which is that this economic reform roundtable is not to make decisions, it’s to inform the government’s decisions. And that’s the point that we have made all along. We are aligned. We have an ambitious agenda that we’re focused on delivering, and this economic reform roundtable is a good opportunity to shake the tree for more ideas in our economy. And the people who criticise this process appear to be saying that we should consult less with the business community or the union movement or the community more broadly, experts and economists. Chalmers says rate cut ‘welcome relief’, but warns unpredictable economy must keep nation on its toes The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said yesterday’s interest rate cut is “welcome relief” to millions of Australians, saying he has confidence the country is on the “right track” addressing inflation and seeing real wages. Chalmers said while inflation had fallen dramatically in recent months, what he called “remarkable progress”, the treasury must remain “always vigilant” amid an unpredictable economy: We are never complacent about developments in the global economy. There is more than the usual amount of churn and change right now. It’s unpredictable, it’s volatile, it’s uncertain. And that’s why one of our key goals is to make our economy more resilient. We will do that by making it more productive over time. An arrest has been made after an incident at Sydney airport this morning. An airport spokesperson said there were no injuries, noting the facility was operating as normal: Sydney Airport is currently assisting Australian Federal Police following an incident earlier this morning. No injuries occurred as a result of the incident. An arrest has been made and the airport is operating normally. We’ll have more details from the AFP soon. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he is up for “big reform” as his government heads into a long-promised productivity roundtable next week. Albanese spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying his government had a strong agenda of promises from the last election, but said there is plenty of room for more ideas. I had a really successful meeting with some business leaders on Monday evening in Melbourne. And some of the ideas that were kicked around there are really positive. They’ll feed into our processes. And that is how good government should operate. We’re an inclusive government. We are up for consultation and we’re up for ideas. RN host Sabra Lane pressed the prime minister about how big the ideas could get, or if the status quo would remain. Albanese replied: I’m up for big reform. … We are up for big reform, whether it’s strengthening Medicare, the changes to childcare, the benefit to education. Good morning, Nick Visser here to take over the blog. Thanks to the always great Martin Farrer. Let’s get to it. Tasmanian Greens declare they are unable ‘at this point’ to support state Labor Tasmania’s minority Liberal government appears increasingly likely to continue ruling, with the Greens declaring they are unable to “at this point” support Labor. The July 19 state election returned another hung parliament, with the Liberals (14 seats) finishing closer than Labor (10) to the 18 seats required for majority. Jeremy Rockliff, the state Liberal leader, has been reappointed premier but both major parties have been trying to garner support from a crossbench containing five Greens, five independents and one Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP. Labor’s leader, Dean Winter, has held talks with independents but has continually ruled out “doing a deal” with the Greens, despite needing their numbers to govern. Winter has flagged a no-confidence motion in Rockliff when parliament resumes on the 18th. Winter and Greens leader Rosalie Woodruff held a formal meeting on Tuesday. “At this stage we cannot have any confidence in the proposed motion to make Dean Winter the premier of Tasmania in parliament,” Woodruff said. Mark Latham is set to defend claims of homosexual vilification against a fellow parliamentarian, Australian Associated Press reports. The former federal Labor leader is due to give evidence at a civil tribunal in Sydney today after the NSW independent MP Alex Greenwich accused him yesterday of having an “abusive obsession” with him. The case relates to a sexually explicit tweet the federal court has previously ruled as defamatory and subsequent media appearances made by Latham, who sits as an independent in the state parliament. Greenwich has sued Latham for homosexual vilification and workplace harassment in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The online sparring match between the two politicians followed violent protests outside a church in Sydney’s south-west, where Latham was giving a pre-election speech in March 2023. About 250 mostly male counter-protesters violently attacked police and 15 LGBTQI protesters. Here’s our report on yesterday’s hearing: Belinda Allen, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank, expects the RBA to wait until November before cutting again – but that could shift depending on how the data unfolds, Australian Associated Press reports. “The governor did not rule out back‑to‑back cuts. Inflation appears under control, so any acceleration of the cutting cycle we expect would have to be driven by a deterioration in the labour market,” she said. Allen said the most important data readings before the next meeting would be labour force surveys released on Thursday and in September, as well as economic growth figures for the June quarter to be released on September 3. RBA staff lowered their GDP growth forecasts as they pared back their expectations for trend productivity growth from one per cent to 0.7% per year. We’re reporting today on how borrowers might have to wait a few weeks to get the benefit of yesterday’s cut. Overnight the foreign minister, Penny Wong, signed Australia to a joint statement with 29 international partners decrying the humanitarian situation in Gaza. It said, in part: The humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels. Famine is unfolding before our eyes. Urgent action is needed now to halt and reverse starvation. We call on the government of Israel to provide authorisation for all international NGO aid shipments and to unblock essential humanitarian actors from operating. All crossings and routes must be used to allow a flood of aid into Gaza, including food, nutrition supplies, shelter, fuel, clean water, medicine and medical equipment. Lethal force must not be used at distribution sites, and civilians, humanitarians and medical workers must be protected. The statement was signed by two EU representatives as well as the foreign ministers of: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it’ll be Nick Visser to take over. Mark Latham will appear at a tribunal in Sydney today to defend claims of homosexual vilification against his fellow NSW MP. It comes after Sydney MP Alex Greenwich told the tribunal yesterday that Latham had an “abusive obsession with me”. A leading bank economist thinks that the Reserve Bank will wait until November before cutting rates again after yesterday’s decision to reduce the cash rate by another 0.25% signalled some relief for borrowers. More coming up. And Australia has signed a joint statement on behalf of 29 international partners saying the humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached “unimaginable” levels and urgent action is needed to halt and reverse starvation. It calls on Israel to facilitate a “flood” of aid into the territory.
