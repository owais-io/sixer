  Texas Democrats are leaving the state to prevent a vote on Monday that could
  see five new Republican-leaning seats created in the House of Representatives.
  About 30 Democrats said they planned to decamp to Illinois, where they plan to
  stay for a week, to thwart Republican efforts by denying them a quorum, or the
  minimum number of members to validate the vote’s proceedings. In a statement,
  Texas Democrats accused their counterparts, the Texas Republicans, of a
  “cowardly” surrender to Donald Trump’s call for a redrawing of the
  congressional map to “continue pushing his disastrous policies”. “Texas
  Democratic lawmakers are halting Trump’s plan by denying his bootlickers a
  quorum,” the statement read. The scheme to leave the state is reported to have
  been put together by the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, who met with the
  Texas Democratic caucus late last month and has directed staff to provide
  logistical support for their stay. The Texas group has accused the Texas
  governor, Greg Abbott, of withholding aid to victims of Guadalupe River
  flooding last month in an attempt to force the redistricting vote through.
  “We’re leaving Texas to fight for Texans,” Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic
  caucus chair, said in a statement. “We will not allow disaster relief to be
  held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. “We’re not walking out on our
  responsibilities; we’re walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen
  to the people we represent,” Wu added. “As of today, this corrupt special
  session is over.” Last week, Texas Republicans released a proposed new
  congressional map that would give the GOP a path to pick up five seats in next
  year’s midterm elections, typically when the governing party loses
  representation in Congress. The areas affected by the redistricting plan would
  target Democratic members of Congress in and around Austin, Dallas and
  Houston, and two districts in south Texas that are Republican but nudging
  closer toward Democrat control. The plan to temporarily vacate the state is
  not without potential consequences. Members of the Texas Democrats face a
  $500-a-day fine and possible arrest, a measure that was introduced in 2023,
  two years after Democrats left the state for three weeks to block election
  legislation that included several restrictions on voting access. Ultimately,
  that bill passed but not before Democrats were able to claim something of a
  moral victory after stripping the measure of some of its provisions. The
  latest plan to leave the state came after a House committee approved new
  congressional maps on Saturday. “This map was politically based, and that’s
  totally legal, totally allowed and totally fair,” Cody Vasut, a Republican
  state representative and committee member, told NBC News. Vasut pointed to
  disparities in other states, including California, New York and Illinois,
  where the weighting of seats to votes is strongly in Democrats’ favor. “Texas
  is underperforming in that. And so it’s totally prudent, totally right, for
  Texas to be able to respond and improve the political performance of its map,”
  he said. The political backdrop to the Texas redistricting fight colors
  Pritzker into the picture of a national fight. Pritzker, a billionaire member
  of the family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain, is seen as looking toward a bid
  for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. In June, he addressed
  Democrats in Oklahoma where he met privately in a “robust” meeting to discuss
  about Texas redistricting, according to NBC News. He later met with Texas
  Democrats, where offered assurances he would find them hotels, meeting spaces
  and other logistical assistance. The absence of the Democrats on Monday
  threatens to derail other issues Abbott is proposing, including disaster
  relief after to the deadly central Texas floods last month. “Democrats in the
  Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and
  brought back to the Capitol immediately,” Texas’s attorney general, Ken
  Paxton, said in a post on X. “We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt
  down those who think they are above the law.” The Texas house speaker, Dustin
  Burrows, said that if, at 3pm on Monday, “a quorum is not present then, to
  borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all
  options will be on the table”.
