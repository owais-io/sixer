  Teen summers before the internet were supposed to be wild and free, but mine
  were mostly boring, spent clumsily painting my toenails, eating Quavers, alone
  in a rain-battered tent. The one thing that made all of that tolerable was
  magazines and, more particularly, teen magazine big summer quizzes. I, for
  one, loved them. Agonising over my answers, totting up my points using an
  unnecessarily complex scoring system, then reading earnestly what my “summer
  style” or “party personality” was or whether I was a “great best friend” was
  as good as it got. And so, in honour of the magazines loved and gone, I’ve
  just wasted spent hours crafting my own summer quiz, which I’m calling “What’s
  your 2025 vibe?” Apologies to aficionados – it’s insufficiently granular for a
  proper 90s girls’ mag quiz (true masters could craft 20 psychologically
  probing questions to tease out what swimsuit style you should try). But if,
  despite the entirety of the internet, you’re bored this summer, give it a go.
  1. You’re caught on the Coldplay jumbotron. How do you react? a. That would
  never happen for, like, a million reasons. b. Instantly start working on a
  strategy to monetise my five seconds of fame. c. Go into therapy. d. Join the
  Foreign Legion. 2. What’s on your style wishlist for this summer? a. Nothing –
  I’m doing “no-buy 2025”. b. Something fishy: I’m having a sardine girl summer.
  c. I’m still searching for barrel-leg jeans that don’t make me look like an
  actual barrel. d. I’m plotting how to replace my panama with a cardinal’s
  biretta. The conclave was a hotbed of “steal his style” temptation. 3. What
  would Donald Trump post about you on Truth Social? a. “In great shape,
  beautiful, wow!” b. “No longer HOT.” c. “A boring and wrong individual, very
  disappointing.” d. “RUDE!” 4. Which billionaire would you least hate to marry?
  a. Bill Gates – at least he’s quite old. b. Elon Musk – at least it’s likely
  to end in lucrative divorce. c. Bryan Johnston – at least he goes to bed
  early. d. I’ve always had a soft spot for the eccentric Regency rake John “Mad
  Jack” Mytton. I’m partial to a bit of naked duck hunting. 5. What are you
  taking? a. I’m microdosing. b. Lion’s mane, collagen and ashwagandha. c.
  Magnesium, omega-3, vitamin D and statins. d. Snuff. 6. What’s your current
  earworm? a. Take a Break, from Hamilton. If you know (about the wave of TikTok
  parodies reframing Alexander Hamilton as a wife-hating commitment-phobe), you
  know. b. “Darling hold my hand … Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday,” ha ha ha
  (help). c. Earworm is actually my nickname for my tinnitus. d. A nightingale
  singing in Berkeley Square. 7. You have half-an-hour to spend on LinkedIn.
  What do you do with it? a. Look for a job. b. Look for a new job. c. Post 400
  AI-crafted words reframing a minor incident in my child’s life as a business
  “lesson”. d. Look at buxom ladies. 8. What’s your summer tipple? a. New-gen
  alcopops. b. Adaptogenic ’shroom coffee. c. Matcha lattes. But why are they so
  dear? d. Gin and Dubonnet. 9. What keeps you awake at night? a. Nothing – I
  prioritise sleep. Early dinner, a lil’ sleepy girl mocktail, 10mg of melatonin
  and I’m out. b. The fear of my Skims face wrap suffocating me. c. The Horrors.
  And a herniated disc. d. Keeping vigil as my wolfhound, Venetia, is due to
  whelp this week. 10. What’s your new hobby? a. Birdwatching. b. Padel. c.
  Strength training. d. Passemanterie. 11. Your male partner starts hanging out
  in parks, painting his nails and whisking his own ceremonial-grade matcha, the
  contents of his tote bag – feminist theory, John Coltrane records, tampons to
  hand out – displayed around him. How do you react? a. Critique his nail shape:
  it’s all about short, not almond! b. Enter him in one of this summer’s
  performative male competitions. We might win a bell hooks book! c. Obsessively
  watch Couples Therapy clips online and diagnose him with pathological
  narcissism. d. Challenge him to a duel. 12. What AI-proof job from the recent
  Microsoft study of occupations that are well placed to survive the robot
  revolution would you choose? a. Floor sander. Good scope for
  Caillebotte-inspired manual labour thirst-trap content. b. Prosthodontist (I
  watch lots of mouth makeovers). c. Dredge operator. d. Roustabout. 13. You’re
  doomscrolling. What’s the first targeted ad you see? a. I use adblockers. b.
  Creatine. c. An ergonomic Nordic haemorrhoid cushion. d. I am not
  “doomscrolling”. I am rereading Trollope. 14. What are you most likely to
  launch this year? a. My exit from all socials. b. A wellness brand. c. A
  gardening Substack. d. A coracle, or possibly a skiff. 15. How do you hit your
  protein goals? a. I’m all about fibre now. b. Greek yoghurt with egg-white
  oats and powdered peanut butter for breakfast, then mostly chicken. I
  sometimes dream about food that isn’t white. c. It’s literally my full-time
  job – I don’t have time to tell you. d. Kedgeree, dover sole and the roast
  beef of old England. 16. What condition has your social media algorithm
  diagnosed you with? a. Yesterday it suggested I “feel dead inside”, lol. b.
  You name it: ADHD, dopamine addiction, Lyme disease, inflammation … c.
  Crumbling bones and varicose veins (accurately). d. Gout. Mostly As:
  Positively futuristic Wow! You’re so effortlessly, enviably up to date you
  might actually be in 2026 already. Have you considered a career as TikTok
  fortune teller? Mostly Bs: More 2025 than a Dubai chocolate Labubu You’re as
  2025 as it gets. (You must be very tired and unhappy – have you considered
  creatine?) Mostly Cs: Mid You’re trying hard, but it’s not quite working.
  Perhaps it’s time to admit you’re actually 55 and quite fancy reading a
  Richard Osman with a mug of Yorkshire Gold? Matcha tastes like grass cuttings
  – go on, admit it. Mostly Ds: It’s giving Victorian ghost Who are you? A
  19th-century country squire? A Julian Fellowes character? On second thoughts,
  living in a delulu bubble of your own imagining is very 2025. Congratulations.
