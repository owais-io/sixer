  What better places to underline the turning wheels of history? “The
  Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin Wall and Checkpoint Charlie,” intoned the
  transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, adding with just a touch of hyperbole:
  “In just a matter of years, rail passengers in the UK could be able to visit
  these iconic sights – direct from the comfort of a train.” After a decade in
  which ministers sold off Britain’s share in Eurostar and left the company
  teetering on the brink, international rail travel is back on the government’s
  menu du jour. With Alexander announcing a bilateral agreement on rail with
  Germany last month, after a similar deal with Switzerland in May, long-lapsed
  ambitions for direct trains across the continent have revived. Yet just as in
  the depths of the cold war, the fate of those vying to reach Checkpoint
  Charlie depends on the machinations of those working in the shadows in London;
  then MI6, now the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). The rail regulator is set to
  decide in the autumn how to allocate space in the solitary train depot that
  holds the key to a successful cross-Channel operation. A host of prospective
  rival companies want to move into the Temple Mills depot occupied by Eurostar,
  while the current operator also seeks room to run trains to Germany.
  Nonetheless, rail historians will note that similar bold promises have been
  made before: in 2010 Deutsche Bahn announced plans for direct trains between
  Frankfurt and London, a scheme that disappeared into the sidings. Since then
  even existing offshoots – Disneyland, Avignon – have withered on the Eurostar
  vine. So what has given such confidence that rail travel through the tunnel
  can flourish at last? The stars are aligning in a number of ways, according to
  Gareth Williams, the general secretary of Eurostar. After dicing with
  extinction during the coronavirus pandemic and post-Brexit border struggles,
  Eurostar is a bigger beast: merged with Thalys and targeting 30 million
  passengers a year, including on Franco-German routes that do not use the
  tunnel. “Year on year, the growth we’re seeing is evidencing that we’re on
  track,” Williams says. “We’re looking to invest £1.5bn – and you’ve got other
  people who want to compete, all of whom are looking for financing for several
  hundred million. It’s not just us who are seeing the potential for growth in
  this market. Banks are prepared to back it.” Helped by smartphones and
  personal entertainment, passengers are happier to spend longer journeys on
  trains, with the success of the London-Amsterdam route demonstrating that the
  old wisdom – that a train could only compete with planes for journeys of less
  than four hours – no longer applies. Demand for green travel is genuinely
  starting to drive passenger choice, Williams says. “If you wind back, everyone
  always said: ‘Yeah, yeah, sustainability is a big factor for me’ – and it was
  never borne out in purchasing decisions. But increasingly that’s switching,
  and business is leading on that switch.” Long-term technical and engineering
  problems are being finally resolved, potentially realising by 2030 the EU’s
  “Ten-T” vision, creating major international corridors for a trans-European
  transport network, a policy that dates back to the 1990s and which the current
  commission hopes to accelerate. Years of grind have harmonised some – if sadly
  not all – aspects such as signalling systems, power transmission and loading
  gauges (maximum sizes) that once halted trains at borders. Williams hopes
  Eurostar’s next fleet will be fully interoperable across its network: “The
  trains used to have to negotiate seven different signalling systems … the
  first generation couldn’t go north of Brussels or the power would give out,
  Frankfurt required a different braking system. It’s really in the detail.”
  With some infrastructure problems eradicated, the train manufacturers Siemens
  and Alstom can design trains across the piste. According to John Lawrence, the
  chair of the railway technical network of the Institution of Engineering and
  Technology, “the physical and technical barriers are less problematic than the
  political barriers and the practical matters of running a rail service – can
  you get a path, can you bludgeon a way through? And can we do it a speed
  that’s attractive?” That gets harder with longer international routes, he
  says: “Where are you going to stable and maintain the trains? And house crews
  when things go wrong? How will you resolve clashes? It’s standard stuff – but
  it gets more complicated with wider stakeholder groups you have to encounter
  on the way.” Part of the shifting landscape is liberalisation of rail in the
  EU, a policy pushed by the UK pre-Brexit, meaning other operators are already
  competing on French railways alongside TGVs run by the SNCF, the majority
  owner of Eurostar. That includes Trenitalia, which runs Frecciarossa trains
  into the south of Paris and is among those looking to rival Eurostar through
  the tunnel. The Italian state company has signed a memorandum of understanding
  with Evolyn, a Spanish startup backed by the owners of the transport
  multinational Mobico, and could move existing trains quicker than new fleets
  could be delivered. Virgin and Uber are also looking to lend their brands to
  new cross-Channel operations. Sir Richard Branson’s venture is being set up
  in-house by the ex-boss of Avanti, while Uber is pairing with Gemini, a
  startup chaired by the rail freight and Channel tunnel veteran Lord Berkeley.
  Earlier this month Branson’s company signed a deal with Alstom for 12
  high-speed trains it plans to use for journeys to mainland Europe by 2030 if
  it wins permission to run Channel tunnel services. The changing financial
  calculations have prompted the operators’ clamour for a piece of the action,
  Berkeley says: “It’s partly Eurotunnel making some quite significant cost
  reductions, while HS1 [now renamed London St Pancras Highspeed] has been told
  to reduce their access charges. And the way that Eurostar fares have shot up
  has encouraged other people to look at it.” The starting gun in the race –
  firmly a marathon rather than a sprint – was arguably fired by Getlink, the
  owners of Eurotunnel, whose chief executive, Yann Leriche, announced discounts
  for new routes or extra services in 2023. A similar deal has been offered by
  LSPH, for the British end of the tracks. Not before time: a recently published
  report by the Steer consultancy, buried for two years in the Department for
  Transport, found that HS1 had been “poor value for money” and delivered far
  fewer international passengers than had been forecast when it opened in 2007.
  Jim Steer, a long-term advocate for high-speed rail, says there are still “a
  lot of challenges to overcome”. But he adds the drive for more trains “is
  encouraging and real – it’s just happening a lot slower than anyone originally
  expected”. Eurostar is targeting airlines’ big business flight corridors from
  London, Geneva and Frankfurt, after its latest success in becoming a market
  leader to Amsterdam. However, while the idea of year-round direct routes to
  the Mediterranean and beyond is tantalising, the geography and financials make
  changing trains in Paris the likely long-term reality. New entrants will focus
  on the lucrative London-Paris core, as Evolyn made clear; Gemini and Virgin
  hinted at wider plans but are so far only committing to Paris and Brussels.
  Berkeley says Gemini’s “cheap and cheerful” model could make rail lower cost”.
  He adds: “Fares are much too high. Eurostar is a nationalised monopoly – we’ll
  have some good competitive spats, I’m sure.” Eurostar says it welcomes the
  competition, as it prepares to finalise its own train order for 50 new trains,
  but wants the government to help provide more capacity. “Whatever the ORR
  turns around and says in October in relation to the Temple Mills depot – what
  about the other people who are wanting to invest, whether that’s us or Virgin,
  etc?” Williams says. “There’s a big opportunity for growth beyond that.”
