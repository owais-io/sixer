  Israel’s president will visit London next Thursday just weeks before the UK is
  expected to recognise the state of Palestine at the UN general assembly, the
  Guardian understands. Two sources have confirmed Isaac Herzog is expected to
  meet UK ministers and senior political figures – the first time a senior
  Israeli leader has been in Britain since the foreign secretary, David Lammy,
  met his Israeli counterpart Gideon Sa’ar on an unannounced visit in the
  spring. However, any meeting between Herzog and Keir Starmer is likely to be
  hugely controversial within Labour amid the death, destruction and starvation
  wreaked by Israel’s war in Gaza. No 10 has not confirmed a meeting between
  Herzog and the prime minister. Downing Street has previously indicated that
  the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, faces arrest if he travels to
  the UK after the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for him
  over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Herzog, who is from a different political
  party to the prime minister, has a more ceremonial role and has previously
  clashed with Netanyahu over democratic and judicial changes but has broadly
  backed the military campaign in Gaza. Herzog himself has received particular
  attention for a statement he made where he asserted that all Palestinians in
  Gaza were “unequivocally” responsible for the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023.
  “The entire [Palestinian] nation out there that is responsible. It is not true
  this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved,” said Herzog in October
  2023. That statement was given additional weight when it was included in the
  International Court of Justice’s order of the 26 of January 2024 findng it was
  “plausible” that Israel has committed acts that violate the Genocide
  Convention and insisting that Israel must ensure “with immediate effect” that
  its forces not commit any of the acts prohibited by the convention and to
  protect Gaza’s population from further risk of genocide. Herzog claimed that
  his statement was misrepresented by the ICJ in selectively quoting him.
  Starmer last met Herzog more than a year ago in Paris shortly after he was
  elected as prime minister, where he praised the “historic friendship between
  Israel and the United Kingdom” and reiterated the demand for the return of
  hostages and “support for Israel’s right to self-defence”. But Starmer and
  Lammy have since been far more vocally critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza,
  which have killed more than 65,000 people according to the territory’s health
  ministry. Sanctions have been imposed on two hardline Israeli cabinet
  ministers and Starmer has announced plans alongside France to recognise the
  state of Palestine this September. However, there remains considerable anger
  and concern within Labour and elsewhere that the UK has done too little to
  halt the suffering of Palestinians. Last week the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed
  Davey, said he planned to boycott a state dinner hosted by King Charles during
  the US president Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK in a fortnight’s time –
  in protest at the US’s lack of pressure on Israel to end the war.
