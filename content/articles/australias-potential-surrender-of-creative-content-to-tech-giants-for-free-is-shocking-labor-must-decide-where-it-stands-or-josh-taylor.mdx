  Tech companies have devalued the work of creative industries for years. The
  latest iteration of this is their insistence the AI models they plan to make
  lots of money from need the labour of all of human creation for free in
  perpetuity. It’s just surprising that the Productivity Commission appears to
  have bought into the argument – and caught the Australian government
  off-guard. The Productivity Commission’s view on AI trained on the copyrighted
  works of others without compensation, published Wednesday, is that the horse
  has already bolted for big tech companies – that providing a text and data
  mining (TDM) exception in copyright law would not change much, but should be
  worth considering. The commission stated that AI models, trained overseas on
  unlicensed copyrighted materials, are already used in Australia by larger
  institutions and a TDM exception is unlikely to change this. The argument is
  that providing an exception could allow smaller local institutions to train
  their own models. That argument would carry more weight if it wasn’t the
  giants of Google, Meta and Atlassian that have so far argued for carte blanche
  AI access to all available human data. As the UK recently experienced, there
  is already almighty pushback from news, film, music and TV companies, as well
  as authors and publishers. This is the case for essentially any industry that
  might now be suddenly expected to hand over its labour for free to the same
  very large tech companies that spent millions of dollars to arguably seek
  favourable AI regulation (ie very little) from the Trump administration. Music
  industry bodies in Australia have said a TDM exception here would “legitimise
  digital piracy under guise of productivity”. It is hard not to view the push
  from tech companies cynically given recent political donations and the current
  AI job-hiring arm’s race. Companies are reportedly offering up to US$100m pay
  packets for AI researchers in a highly competitive jobs market, while at the
  same time crying poor when it comes to paying for the data that will make
  those AI models useful. Many in media have been through waves of redundancies
  because tech companies promised the rivers of gold would return with a pivot
  to on-platform video, hopes suddenly dashed when Facebook deprioritised video.
  When the Coalition government forced Meta and Google to negotiate with
  publishers for payment for their content, Meta temporarily removed news from
  its platforms in Australia, before eventually coming to the table. When those
  deals came up for renewal, Meta had turned the tap off for news content
  appearing in people’s feeds, and argued news wasn’t important for the platform
  anymore. The attitude to training AI models on the work of others seems no
  different. The claim that the models are already trained and it is therefore
  too late to do anything about it ignores the question of what happens next.
  News companies – including the Guardian, which has opposed the exception
  proposal in the UK – will remain a vital resource that AI will need to train
  on, to respond to growing user demand for the latest information. But allowing
  AI to access that offers very little in return to those companies if they
  aren’t paid. AI summaries in Google search results mean people now click
  through less and less to find the details in a news story. A recent study
  suggests a site previously ranked top in search results could see a 79% drop
  in clickthroughs. Cloudflare – the internet infrastructure company that has
  launched a way to block AI crawlers from sites unless they pay up – has said
  the results are even worse in AI chatbots. As of June, Google crawled websites
  about 14 times for every referral, Cloudflare said, but OpenAI’s
  crawl-to-referral ratio was 1,700:1, and Anthropic’s was 73,000:1, Cloudflare
  said. One can argue sites already do have an option to opt out: by including a
  “robots.txt” file on their website to say “don’t crawl my page”. But as
  Cloudflare points out, that amounts to little more than putting up a rules
  sign next to the pool. The Albanese government appears to have been caught
  unaware that an overhaul of copyright law for AI was something tech companies
  have been pushing for – and something the Productivity Commission appears to
  be open to. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, referred questions on it to Tim
  Ayres, the industry and science minister. Ayres told ABC News Breakfast on
  Wednesday there were “no plans to make changes” in regards to copyright law.
  But while the opposition has already come out strongly against the use of
  copyrighted material without compensation, Labor needs to figure out where it
  stands. At a time when the government is championing its under-16s social
  media ban as “world-leading”, and with various new regulations facing the tech
  sector – from child protection, to paying news companies for news, to
  competition changes for Apple and Google app stores being floated –
  Australia’s potential surrender of all the content of human creation to the
  tech giants, for free, seems jarring. To argue that without it we will “fall
  behind” seems to ignore years of regulators struggling to play catch-up with
  tech companies. Despite Bill Heslop-ian cries of “you can’t stop progress”
  from those who stand to gain the most, they may soon realise it won’t last
  when those whose content they need for AI cannot viably continue to produce
  it. • Josh Taylor is Guardian Australia’s technology reporter
