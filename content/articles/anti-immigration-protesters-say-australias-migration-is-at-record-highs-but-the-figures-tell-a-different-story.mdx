  Australia’s immigration figures are not at record highs, migration experts
  say, rejecting claims aired at rallies on Sunday. Experts say confusion about
  various migration numbers, and a recent case of inaccurate reporting which
  spread like wildfire online, have combined to give a false impression of
  overseas arrivals. The government says Australia’s net overseas migration
  figure is actually down 37% from a recent peak, countering claims aired by
  those behind the weekend’s anti-immigration rallies. How many people are
  coming to Australia? There are several numbers relating to migration which are
  – correctly or incorrectly – bandied about: permanent migration, net overseas
  migration, and overseas arrivals and departures. Abul Rizvi, former deputy
  secretary in the immigration department, and Prof Alan Gamlen of the
  Australian National University, said the most relevant number when considering
  the impact on housing and infrastructure – some of the concerns raised by
  protesters – was the net overseas migration figure, or NOM. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Federal government figures show the NOM for the 12 months
  to 31 December 2024 was 341,000 people. That’s down 37% compared to the NOM’s
  peak, of 538,000, in the 2022-23 year. That record number, covering the period
  when Labor took office in May 2022, came after the former Coalition “stomped
  on the immigration accelerator” after the closure of Australia’s international
  borders during the Covid pandemic, Rizvi said, in a bid to make up shortfalls.
  “Net migration is definitely falling, not rising – but it’s not falling as
  fast as Treasury is forecasting, and I don’t think it will fall as far,” Rizvi
  said. Gamlen, director of the ANU’s migration hub, agreed migration was
  currently “not at a record level”. “The trend of migration is steeply
  downwards” from recent highs, Gamlen said. What were recent numbers? We are
  still waiting for accurate NOM figures for more recent times. Rizvi said by
  mid-September, a more accurate picture would emerge. But while the latest
  figures are far from a record, other data from recent periods was much higher.
  Between mid-2016 and early 2020, the NOM has hovered around 206,000 to 263,000
  a year. But the Covid border closures saw NOM fall into negative territory for
  four straight quarters, with 95,000 more people leaving Australia than
  arriving in the year to March 2021. After Covid restrictions eased in 2021 and
  2022, the NOM soared. It hit 342,000 in the year to September 2022, then
  433,000 in the year to December 2022. “We know the trend is sharply downwards
  [from the peak],” Gamlen said. “We had a surge of arrivals after the pandemic
  to catch up when migration went in negative territory, but the arrivals
  catchup wasn’t big enough to make up for the shortfall.” What did
  anti-immigration rally organisers say? Information distributed by rally
  organisers said the march sought “an end to mass immigration”. Some material
  included claims that Australia was at a record high of immigration. Such
  claims were supported by One Nation’s Pauline Hanson, who claimed on Monday
  that “the major parties keep ramping up immigration”. One claim which spread
  online was an allegation that Australia was bringing in 1,500 new overseas
  arrivals each week. That claim was advanced by some conservative media outlets
  and picked up traction online among some supporters of the rally. But Rizvi
  and Gamlen said the number was inaccurate, and a misunderstanding of migration
  figures. That figure, they said, referred to overseas arrivals and departures
  (OAD) data – which is more about tourist arrivals than migrants. Media and
  online commentary about the issue led the Australian Bureau of Statistics to
  last week issue a stern rebuke and fact check, saying the use of OAD data
  “does not reflect the official ABS definition of migration and may lead to
  inaccurate conclusions on migration”. OAD data “is a count of border crossings
  rather than migration. It is best used to understand patterns in traveller
  movements, such as tourism trends and seasonal travel,” the ABS said. The
  bureau noted that someone on a temporary visa, who travelled in and out of
  Australia multiple times, would count as a visitor several times “even though
  they only migrated here once”. Rizvi said the use of that number by migration
  critics was “nonsense”. Are there other concerns about migration? Migration
  was a key point of contention in the May election. Peter Dutton’s Coalition
  pledged deep cuts to permanent migration – another separate figure – and to
  cut the NOM by 100,000 below Labor’s figures. Labor has said it wants to bring
  the NOM back below pre-pandemic levels. But its NOM for this year, usually
  contained in the federal budget, was not delivered with the March budget so
  close to the May election. The number is expected soon, government sources
  say. But Rizvi said the government would probably struggle to meet its own
  promise and projections. He said the only way to cut migration by a large
  enough amount would be to slash visas for partners of Australian residents,
  visas for overseas workers, or both – options he expected would be unpalatable
  to the government, on either a policy or a political level. “There’s no easy
  way out. They’re all bad options,” Rizvi said. What has the government said?
  In parliament on Monday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, noted the
  decrease of 37% in the NOM. He was responding to a question from MP Bob
  Katter, who spoke at the Townsville anti-immigration rally on Sunday. Katter
  claimed “400,000 people [were] coming from overseas each year”. Albanese
  rejected Katter’s claims, responding: “I’m not sure what the basis of them
  are.” “People in this country voted for a government that would understand
  that modern Australia was … a different nation than it was under the White
  Australia policy some time ago.” Albanese added that “diversity is a strength
  in modern Australia”, saying migration presents an “incredible economic
  opportunity due to the diaspora here and their connections with every country
  on the planet”. What effect does migration have on housing, infrastructure and
  the economy? Gamlen said migrants were not to blame for Australia’s housing
  concerns. In fact, he said, it could be the opposite. “House prices started
  booming in the middle of the pandemic, the end of 2020, when net migration was
  its lowest level in 100 years,” he said. “It’s simply invalid to say this
  housing price boom was caused by net migration … Research shows the
  relationship between migration and housing is small and weak.” Gamlen said
  migration may actually contribute to demand and supply, noting migrant workers
  were brought to Australia in construction trades. “Some of them come in and
  build houses, and some are housebuilders. It evens out, migration is a small
  piece of the housing puzzle. Other issues with housing are to do with the
  problem,” he said. Cutting migration numbers would also have an impact on
  foreigners coming to Australia on working holiday or student visas, who
  contribute to Australia’s economy, particularly the international education
  sector and businesses already struggling to find workers in a tight labour
  market.
