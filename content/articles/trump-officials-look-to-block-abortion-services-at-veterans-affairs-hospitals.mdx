  The Trump administration is seeking to block veterans from receiving abortions
  at hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs in cases of rape or
  incest, or when a veteran’s pregnancy has imperiled their health, according to
  new paperwork filed by the administration. The administration is seeking to
  roll back a Biden-era policy that, for the first time, permitted the VA to
  counsel veterans and their eligible family members about abortion, as well as
  offer the procedure to veterans in limited circumstances, even in states that
  banned abortion after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. At
  the time, veterans affairs secretary Denis McDonough called the move a
  “patient safety decision”. More than a dozen states ban virtually all
  abortions. As of 2024, more than half of female veterans live in states that
  ban abortion or are likely to, according to the National Partnership for Women
  &amp; Families. However, in a Friday filing in the federal register, the Trump
  administration said that the Biden-era policy was “legally questionable” and
  out of step with congressional actions that limited the VA’s ability to
  provide abortions. Anti-abortion activists have spent years advocating against
  federal funding for abortion access of any kind. Due to their efforts, it is
  already illegal to use federal dollars to pay for abortions except in cases of
  rape, incest or medical emergency. In its filing, the administration said
  that, despite the rollback, veterans who are undergoing miscarriages or
  ectopic pregnancies – which are nonviable pregnancies in which an embryo
  implants outside of the uterus – would still be able to receive care. Veterans
  would also be able to get abortions “when a physician certifies that the life
  of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. (The
  Department of Veterans Affairs did not respond to a request for comment at the
  time of publication.) However, the administration’s assurances may face
  practical hurdles in states that outlaw abortion. Since Roe fell, dozens of
  women have said that they were denied medically necessary abortions, despite
  the fact that abortion bans typically permit abortions in situations where a
  person’s health or life is under threat. Doctors have also said that, because
  abortion bans are worded so ambiguously, they are often unsure if or when they
  can step in to end dangerous pregnancies. Instead, doctors have been forced to
  delay care until patients get sick enough that they can legally intervene.
  “Those who fight for all our freedom must have the most basic freedom to
  control their own bodies and futures – and this rule robs them of it,” Alexis
  McGill Johnson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of
  America, said in a statement on Monday. “Taking away access to heath care
  shows us that the Trump administration will always put politics and
  retribution over people’s lives.” The rollback of the Biden-era policy has not
  yet been finalized. The public has until early September to comment on the
  Trump administration’s proposal.
