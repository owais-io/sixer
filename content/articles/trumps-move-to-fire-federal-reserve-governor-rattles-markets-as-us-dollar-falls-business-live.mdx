  UK retail stocks are selling off this morning after a downbeat note from
  analysts at Deutsche Bank. Associated British Foods, which owns Primark as
  well as a range of other food and drink brands such as Twinings, has fallen by
  5% this morning, after analysts at the bank downgraded their view on the stock
  from a neutral “hold” to “sell”. Deutsche also downgraded its view on home
  improvement retailer Wickes to a “sell”, with its shares falling by as much as
  9% this morning, making it the worst laggard in the mid-cap FTSE 250 index
  today. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher was moved down from a “buy” to a “hold”
  rating, sending its shares down by as much as 4% this morning. Adam Cochrane
  and Benjamin Yokyong-Zoega, of the bank, said: We are taking a more cautious
  view on the UK consumer. The end of 2024 and early 2025 are likely to have
  been the sweet spot with real wage growth set to slow and fear of unemployment
  set to build from here. Our Household Cash Flow model shows discretionary
  spending lagging spending power and, unless consumers reduce savings, there
  will be a 4ppt slowdown in discretionary spend to +3% in 2H from +7% in 1H.
  Retail sales have been resilient into Q2 helped by warm weather although there
  is some variance by category. Consumer confidence metrics remain subdued and
  our new DB “Fear Index” suggests things may be getting worse. The bank also
  lowered its target prices for Dunelm and Marks &amp; Spencer, although still
  retained their “buy” ratings on the stocks. The shares are down 0.6% and 0.5%
  respectively this morning. The wobble in the UK bond market also follows a
  high reading for food inflation from the British Retail Consortium. It found
  that shop prices had risen at their fastest pace for 18 months, with food
  inflation hitting 4.2% in August. That was driven by a jump in the cost of
  grocery staples such as eggs and butter, the industry body said. Helen
  Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said the rapid rise added to the
  pressure on people already struggling with the cost of living. Staples such as
  butter and eggs saw significant increases due to high demand, tightening
  supply, and increased labour costs. Chocolate also got more expensive as
  global prices of cocoa remain high owing to poor harvests. UK bonds are
  falling this morning: the yield on the two-year gilt rose by as much as 6
  basis points to 4.008%, while the yield on the 30-year gilt also rose by
  5.634%, its highest point since April. Bond yields rise when prices fall. It
  follows a rise in US Treasury yields after Donald Trump ordered the removal of
  Lisa Cook from the board of governors on the Federal Reserve, the US central
  bank. The sell-off in the bond market also follows reports over the weekend
  that the UK is facing an “IMF bailout”. Jagjit Chadha, a professor of
  economics at the University of Cambridge and former head of the National
  Institute for Economic and Social Research, claimed the economy was at risk of
  “collapse”. He said the financial situation was “as perilous the period
  leading up to the IMF loan of 1976”, when Britain had to be bailed out by the
  global banking body. He told the When the Facts Change Substack, written by
  Liam Halligan: I’m in a world in which I could imagine it [an IMF bailout]
  happening, and we’ll be bereft in that case. We will not be able to roll over
  debt, we will not be able to meet pensions payments, benefits will be hard to
  pay out.” The pound is also a bit weaker this morning, down by 0.01% against
  the US dollar to $1.3456. European shares are broadly down this morning, with
  the European Stoxx 600 index down by 0.7%. That was led by France’s Cac 40
  index, which has dropped by 1.4%, mirroring a fall in its bond market. The
  UK’s blue chip FTSE 100 index is down by 0.6% this morning, with Associated
  British Foods, the owner of Primark, the biggest faller, down 3.9%. Meanwhile,
  the German Dax index has dropped 0.9%, while the Italian FTSE MIB has fallen
  by 1.2%. Political uncertainty in France is shaking its bond market, with its
  10-year bond yield rising by as much as 2 basis points this morning to trade
  around 3.51%, its highest level since March. Bond yields rise when prices
  fall. It comes after Prime minister François Bayrou called a confidence vote
  that could topple the French government next month, as he tries to find
  support for plans to shore up the government’s ailing public finances. Bayrou
  has said France is going through a “decisive moment”. If the government
  secures a majority in the confidence vote, it would be confirmed, he said, but
  “if it does not have a majority, the government will fall”. Charlotte de
  Montpellier, senior economist at the broker ING, says the “obstacle is almost
  impossible to overcome”. Bayrou’s centrist coalition holds just 210 of 577
  seats in the Assembly. The far-right RN, far-left LFI, Greens, and
  Communists—together 264 MPs—have already declared they will vote against him.
  Only the Socialist Party could tip the balance, but early signals suggest they
  are unwilling to support the government without major revisions to the budget,
  which seems unlikely. …If Bayrou loses the vote, President Macron will face a
  difficult choice: appoint a new prime minister capable of forming a government
  in a fragmented Assembly, or dissolve Parliament and call new
  elections—something he has previously ruled out. Either path would inject
  fresh uncertainty into an already fragile political landscape. The likely fall
  of the government will weigh heavily on the French economy. With only 0.8% GDP
  growth expected this year, the economy was already weak, and the political
  crisis adds a new layer of uncertainty. Drafting and passing a 2026 budget
  will become even harder, delaying fiscal consolidation and potentially
  worsening France’s debt trajectory. The longer reforms are postponed, the
  greater the eventual adjustment will need to be. In short, France’s political
  instability is becoming an economic liability. Investors and institutions will
  be watching closely—not just for what happens on 8 September, but for what
  comes next. Closer to home, there are a few corporate updates after the bank
  holiday. Soraya Benchikh, chief financial officer at British American Tobacco,
  is stepping down today, the company said in a statement. Javed Iqbal will act
  as the interim CFO until the company appoints a permanent successor. Meanwhile
  the FTSE 100 distribution group Bunzl has reported that its first-half sales
  rose by 0.8% to £5.76bn, in line with expectations. Pre-tax profit fell by
  10.5% to £250.2m in the six months ended in June. However, the company said it
  would resume the remaining £86m of its previously announced £200m share
  buyback, after pausing it in April. Trump’s attempt to intervene at the
  Federal Reserve has spooked investors, with gold, which is viewed as a safe
  haven asset, rising this morning. Economists at Deutsche Bank write: Gold
  spiked by +1% and is holding on to most of this overnight gain, while futures
  on the S&amp;P 500 (-0.14%) and the Nasdaq (-0.18%) are modestly lower.
  Meanwhile, the Treasury curve has seen a sizeable steepening, with the 2yr
  yield trading -0.7bps lower but the 10yr up +2.9bps and the 30yr +4.5bps to
  4.93%. This has brought the 2s30s slope to 122bps, its steepest since January
  2022 when the Fed had not yet started its post-Covid hiking cycle. Cook’s
  removal could push the Fed to a more dovish stance, say economists at Deutsche
  Bank. They write: Were Cook’s dismissal to hold, it would open up another seat
  for Trump to fill on the seven-person Federal Reserve Board. With Stephen
  Miran nominated for the seat recently vacated by Governor Kugler and with
  Governors Waller and Bowman dissenting in favour of a rate cut at the July
  meeting, this would increase the prospects of a dovish majority on the Board.
  Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2022, was working a term
  that was not due to expire until 2038. If she were to be removed, it would
  give Trump the change to secure a four-person majority on the Fed’s board of
  governors. Market bets suggest there is an 82% chance that the Fed will vote
  to cut its key interest rate at its next meeting in mid-September. However,
  economic data coming out this week on inflation and the labour market could
  still sway the decision. Here is Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the
  University of Michigan, drawing a parallel with Turkey’s president Recep
  Tayyip Erdoğan. Donald Trump has moved to oust Lisa Cook, a governor at the
  Federal Reserve, in his latest attack on the American central bank. It is an
  unprecedented intervention by a US president, which threatens to undermine the
  independence of the central bank of the biggest economy in the world. Trump
  posted a letter on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday, claiming
  he had “sufficient cause” to fire Cook, based on allegations she made false
  statements on one or more mortgage loans. Cook, who is the first black woman
  to serve on the Fed Board in Washington, has sad that Trump has no authority
  to fire her and that she will not quit. She said: I do intend to take any
  questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal
  Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any
  legitimate questions and provide the facts. The news has spooked markets, with
  the US dollar and long-dated Treasuries both falling on Tuesday. The US dollar
  index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies,
  fell by 0.1%. Trump’s latest attack on the Fed follows “relentless pressure”
  on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, notes Tony Sycamore, of the broker IG. He says: In
  the short term, the removal of Cook who has tended to vote with the FOMC
  majority, increases the likelihood of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC
  meeting. A prospect expected to weigh on the US dollar and lend support to
  equities and other risk assets, including Bitcoin. However, beyond the “sugar
  hit” of a rate cut in September, recent developments around key Fed personal,
  heighten concerns over rising political interference, raising the risk that
  traders view the Fed as politically compromised. This could trigger a rerun of
  the “Sell US assets” theme seen earlier this year. In such a scenario, both
  the US dollar and US equities could experience sharp declines. The agenda
