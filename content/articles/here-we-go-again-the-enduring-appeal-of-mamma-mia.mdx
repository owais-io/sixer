  The siren call comes from inside the house at 1634 Broadway: two plinking,
  instantly recognizable marimba notes, followed by a bubbly swell of melody and
  accompanied of course by Technicolor lights and the option of a triple-shot
  cocktail. Yes, Mamma Mia! is back on Broadway, once again providing
  much-needed escapism via idyllic Greek isle and the mind-clearing oeuvre of
  Abba. The grandaddy – or, perhaps, erstwhile father – of the modern jukebox
  musical returned to the Winter Garden Theatre this month after a decade away
  from New York, much to the delight of pop music fans young and old charmed by
  its ebullient disco and gloriously ludicrous plot. It may be fair to say that
  it never really left; though the original closed after in 2015 after nearly 14
  years on Broadway, Mamma Mia! still echoes loudly in musical theater as,
  arguably, the ultimate feelgood show – a “giant singing Hostess cupcake”, as
  the New York Times memorably put it in their 2001 review. An untold number of
  jukebox musicals have proliferated in its frothy wake, featuring the catalogs
  of everyone from Buddy Holly to Alicia Keys, Alanis Morissette to the
  behind-the-scenes pop maestro Max Martin, though never with quite the same
  level of success and enduring appeal as the originators of the term “Swedish
  hitmaker”. (Mamma Mia! is still running in London, where it first premiered in
  1999, making it the longest-running jukebox musical in the West End, and the
  fifth-longest of all time.) A 2008 film adaptation starring Meryl Streep and
  Amanda Seyfried – the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation until last year’s
  Wicked – cemented the musical, written by Catherine Johnson with music by
  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, as a beloved slice of seriously unserious
  pop culture, a status not undone by its much less successful 2018 sequel,
  Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again. Judy Craymer, producer of the musical and its
  films, has confirmed that an improbable third movie is in development, with
  Seyfried in support and noted Abba fan Sabrina Carpenter eyed for a role. And
  the music of Abba has morphed from possibly risible artefact of the disco era
  to an inescapable pillar of celebratory dancefloors, rebounding around the
  English-language soundscape like its palindromic name. Its placeless, magnetic
  tunes seem to have always existed, the Greek chorus of effervescent pop
  culture. The four members of Abba – Andersson, Ulvaeus, Agnetha Fältskog and
  Anni-Frid “Frida” Lyngstad – also live in perpetual youth as holograms in the
  popular Abba: Voyage virtual show in London. At a nearly full matinee showing
  this month, a crowd that appeared to be mostly out-of-towners or original
  Dancing Queens greeted what has been billed as a “strictly limited” return
  engagement (until 1 February) with the enthusiasm of people who did not seem
  to realize that Mamma Mia! had ever been gone at all. Which is to say,
  happily, warmly and without extra fanfare. The production had the extra part
  covered; the second act overture, a medley of some of the hits-only show’s top
  hits, was so abruptly loud that I jerked bolt upright in my seat, and I am
  someone generally soothed by the sensation of hearing loss. I managed to catch
  one of the final handful of Mamma Mia’s 5,773 performances during its original
  run, and though I remember the sensation of attending – enlivened, giddy, a
  little daunted – I managed to lose most recollection of the plot (it
  presumably also served triple-dose cocktails). Which is fine, as Johnson’s
  book is a nonessential and enjoyably ridiculous narrative seemingly invented
  to string together more than 20 Abba songs with their lyrics mostly unaltered.
  For those who also need a refresher: a few months before her wedding,
  20-year-old Sophie (Amy Weaver) snoops through her mother’s diary and
  discovers three former suitors of her mother, the fiercely independent Donna
  (Christine Sherrill), who could each be her father. She invites them to the
  big day, at her mother’s self-run Greek taverna, though none know the real
  reason; Donna, a former disco singer, greets each of them (Rob Marnell, Jim
  Newman and Victor Wallace) with shock, a power drill and an especially
  spirited rendition of the titular track. In a matter of hours before the
  wedding, everyone seeks a very last-minute form of truth or former disco
  glory. This new rendition is no less spirited than its predecessor, though a
  bit smaller in stature, being a touring company bound for Wilmington, North
  Carolina, in March. That’s most obvious in the show’s relatively simplistic
  set – noticeably less grand than your typical Broadway musical fare – and lack
  of a marquee name, though the performers are consistently solid (and
  consistently drowned out by the music; anything short of a full BFA belt did
  not rise over the orchestra). But even a slightly scaled-down Mamma Mia! packs
  a punch – a walloping of foundational pop from start to finish. It’s little
  surprise that even in previews, the return show immediately became one of the
  highest-grossing shows on Broadway, up there with fellow musical juggernauts
  such as Hamilton, the Lion King and Wicked. By the time of its ecstatic second
  ending, a three-track encore that gets all the adult characters into galactic
  disco suits for a straight concert play of the hits, the whole crowd
  expectedly gets on its feet. Afterwards, an older woman behind me grabbed her
  friends’ wrists, arms overhead in a joint cheer, as if celebrating in a
  long-sought victory. And so goes the lure of Abba, a warm and welcome loop
  that never really ends.
