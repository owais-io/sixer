  Sometimes people attend therapy because they are mandated to attend, not
  because they want to. Bill* was one of these clients. He sat before me,
  avoiding eye contact, arms crossed. “I didn’t hurt anyone, not like those
  other blokes did,” he said. Bill had been placed in a sex offenders group
  treatment program but was terminated for non-attendance. He said he had found
  it too hard to hear how the others had offended so he stopped going. In his
  mind he was different to them. I’d read Bill’s file carefully before seeing
  him. In forensic work this is a non-negotiable, as the version of events
  clients present is often different to the way events transpired, and there are
  often rationalisations or justifications for behaviours. I knew Bill had been
  convicted of possessing and distributing child exploitation material (CEM) and
  had been found with hard drives containing thousands of folders of it. He had
  been distributing it for years in return for other CEM images. He was
  identified as being at higher risk than the average CEM offender and treatment
  was mandated. Before starting treatment, we spoke about the limits of
  confidentiality in detail. As a registered psychologist, I am mandated to
  report any child sexual or physical abuse, including the use of CEM, and it
  was important that Bill understood what this meant for our therapy. He
  insisted that he was not aroused by children. This is a common occurrence
  among CEM offenders and is a reflection of the instinctive human need to shy
  away from admitting something shameful. Nevertheless, clinical judgment based
  on his years of CEM abuse and use of a clinical measure of sexual interest in
  children suggested that he probably had paedophilic interests, which amplified
  his risk of reoffending. Treatment for CEM use is still at a nascent stage and
  there have been few comprehensive evaluations of programs to assess whether
  they are successful in reducing risk. For Bill, as for most of my forensic
  clients, I used a tailored approach based on a formulation of his offending
  and his needs, and aligned this with the existing research surrounding risk
  factors for CEM within the risk-needs-responsivity model of rehabilitation.
  Bill’s denial that his offending was problematic is a common rationalisation
  for CEM users but pointed to offence-supportive thoughts we needed to address.
  We also identified that he had experienced longstanding anxiety and fears of
  sexual inadequacy. Bill also had great difficulty managing emotion and often
  experienced high anxiety and stress levels. Outside his connections on the
  dark web he was isolated and spent most of his time playing video games. This
  isolation had stopped him from acknowledging the reality of his CEM abuse –
  until police raided his home. Our work began with getting Bill to identify a
  few things he wanted to work on. This kind of “buy-in” is important when
  working with mandated clients and is a key part of making them ready for
  treatment. We identified that we both wanted the same thing – for Bill to not
  reoffend – and this shared goal allowed us to form an alliance. We also
  focused on developing a shared understanding of his offending to ensure he
  understood his “offence map”, the unnoticed steps which resulted in his
  decision to offend. We needed to work on building better emotional regulation
  skills so he could better manage stress, and also started discussing ways we
  could reduce his use of the internet, as absorption in the online world
  facilitated his offending. We also needed to help him find ways to manage his
  urge to use CEM in future, and built a “toolkit” to support him at these
  times, including use of the Stop it now service and techniques such as urge
  surfing. While Bill remained in denial about the extent of the harm his
  behaviours had likely caused to real children, he was sincere about his desire
  to ensure he didn’t reoffend. We were able to make some progress towards
  reducing the likelihood that he would, with Bill monitored by the sex offender
  registry and community corrections to further manage the risk he posed. *All
