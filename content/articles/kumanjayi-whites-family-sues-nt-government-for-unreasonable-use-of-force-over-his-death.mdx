  over his death

  The mother of Kumanjayi White, a Warlpiri man who died after being restrained
  in an Alice Springs supermarket by police, is suing the Northern Territory
  government in the federal court, claiming that the officers committed assault,
  battery and false imprisonment. White, a 24-year-old with disabilities, died
  on 27 May during a confrontation with police in a Coles supermarket. His
  family claim that the two officers involved acted unlawfully in apprehending
  him, taking him into custody, and “applying force to him such as to cause the
  loss of his life”. Police alleged White was shoplifting and said plainclothes
  officers had stepped in after an altercation with a security guard. According
  to court documents released to Guardian Australia this week, White’s mother,
  Selma Tasman, said she was also bringing the proceedings on behalf of other
  relatives, including his sister and grandfather. The legal action was first
  reported by the ABC. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It is the Applicant’s
  case that these two police officers had no lawful authority to apprehend
  Kumanjayi White, to take him into their custody and to apply force to him in
  the manner which they did, and which force, further, was unreasonable,” the
  claim said. “By doing so, they committed the torts of assault and battery and
  false imprisonment. Alternatively, in exercising any such powers (the
  existence of which is denied), they owed Kumanjayi White a duty to exercise
  reasonable care, which duty they breached. “In either case, the two police
  officers are liable to the Estate … and to the Applicant and the other members
  of Kumanjayi White’s family … for damages.” The damages sought include burial
  costs and aggravated damages for the family’s injury. In the legal claim,
  which was filed by the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (NAAJA) in
  July, Tasman argued that the territory was vicariously liable for the wrongful
  conduct of the officers, as they were purporting to act in the performance of
  their duties when the death occurred. The officers involved will be included
  in the case once they are identified, according to the claim. “The information
  about the circumstances in which Kumanjayi White passed on … is taken from two
  media releases issued by the Northern Territory Police Force on 27 May 2025.
  “This is the only information with which the Applicant has been provided by
  the Respondent about the circumstances in which Kumanjayi White passed on.
  “The Applicant was not present when these events occurred and does not know
  the police officers involved or the detail of the circumstances in which
  Kumanjayi White passed on. The Applicant needs information about those matters
  to prepare for and conduct the trial of this matter.” Tasman is seeking
  federal court orders that would allow her to obtain that information from an
  NT police investigation and the report it is preparing for the coroner. Legal
  action against police must commence within two months of the event in the NT,
  a restriction that has been criticised by legal and human rights groups
  including NAAJA. The first hearing in the case, before Justice Erin
  Longbottom, is set for next week. The NT government has not been required to
  file any defence to the case. In Australia, the crisis support service
  Lifeline is 13 11 14. Indigenous Australians can call 13YARN on 13 92 76 for
