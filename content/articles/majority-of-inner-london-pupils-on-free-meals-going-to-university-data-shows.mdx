  Young people from deprived families in inner London are going to university at
  a greater rate than children in other parts of England, even as enthusiasm for
  higher education has levelled off nationally. More than 50% of inner London’s
  pupils on free school meals (FSM) had progressed to higher education by age 19
  in 2023-24, compared with fewer than 46% of young people from all backgrounds,
  and below 20% for pupils on FSM living in a quarter of local authorities
  outside London. One in 10 of the inner London pupils gained places at
  selective universities such as those in the Russell Group, double the rate for
  young people on FSM from elsewhere in England. Prof Graeme Atherton, an
  associate pro-vice-chancellor at the University of West London and an expert
  in access to higher education, said the extraordinary success of the inner
  London pupils was due to a combination of factors. “GCSE attainment rates have
  been higher in London, and have been for a long time, so that drives
  participation,” Atherton said. “There’s a greater proclivity, that you can see
  in some of the data, for those from non-white backgrounds to enter higher
  education whatever grades they get – and the majority of young people in inner
  London are non-white. And there’s the proximity of higher education
  institutions, there’s lots of them in inner London … There’s more universities
  on your doorstep there. “Put that all together and you’ve got a combination
  that leads to higher participation, and that’s across the board. But what’s
  also interesting is the difference between inner and outer London, where the
  participation rate isn’t so high. So maybe it’s also something about the
  critical mass of young people from similar backgrounds.” Sarah Hannafin, head
  of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Children’s
  educational attainment and life chances should not be constrained by their
  family’s means or where they live.” The detailed statistics from the
  Department for Education tracked pupils eligible for FSM at age 15 or younger
  to age 19, and showed that the “participation gap” between young people from
  deprived backgrounds and their better-off peers had shrunk, boosted by the
  performance of those from London. In particular, the gap narrowed between FSM
  eligible pupils and others attending “high tariff” universities requiring top
  A-level grades. But the national figures showed waning enrolments in 2023-24,
  which Atherton described as “stagnant” nationally, after record levels of
  enrolments during the Covid pandemic. He said: “We’re seeing more evidence of
  student poverty. These young people, aged 17 or 18, they have friends, they
  have social media, they know what the student experience is like, and that
  could be off-putting. But overall there’s still solid demand, with regional
  differences.” Among students who took A-levels at age 17, 80.6% had gone on to
  university or other higher education by age 19, a drop of more than two
  percentage points compared with 2022-23. Among all state school pupils at age
  15, the progression rate by age 19 decreased from 46.9% to 45.8% in 2023-24.
  The biggest exception was among black pupils, where progression to university
  rose to 63.3% – the biggest increase among any ethnic group since 2009, and
  the only group to have increased year on year. White pupils were the least
  likely to progress to higher education by age 19, at 40.5%.
