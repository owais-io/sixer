  As a Cambodian living in Thailand, 31-year-old Da, has kept her children home
  from school this week in fear they might face abuse. “One of my friends went
  to the market yesterday to buy durian and the seller told her that she hated
  Cambodians,” she says, of rising tensions between the neighbouring countries.
  Days after Thailand and Cambodia announced a ceasefire after a deadly five-day
  conflict, relations remain dangerously frayed, and peace tenuous. Since the
  truce both sides have accused each other of violating it, while online, public
  distrust is being fuelled by a bitter confluence of disinformation, threats
  and nationalism. Dowsawan Vanthong, 50, who is volunteering at a temple in
  Surin, northeastern Thailand, that is hosting evacuated people, worries that
  even if calm prevails and the disputed border eventually reopens, relations
  won’t be the same. “For me, I can make a distinction and separate normal
  Cambodians [from the government or military]… But I’m not sure if everyone
  could do this, especially people in the areas that were most affected,” she
  says. At least 43 people were killed on either side of the border in the
  clashes, the worst to grip the two nations in more than a decade. In normal
  times, residents would regularly cross the 800km border that separates the two
  countries, going back and forth for trade and work, school or healthcare.
  Before the conflict started, more than 520,000 Cambodians worked across
  Thailand, often in low-paid jobs in agriculture, construction, fishing and
  manufacturing. But the border is now almost entirely shut, though Cambodians
  living in Thailand can return home. Thousands have queued up to do so, worried
  about rising vitriol in Thailand. Da, who works as a cleaner and asked for her
  real name not to be published due to the tensions, says she has to stay in
  Thailand for economic reasons and to pay off debts, but she feels still feels
  uneasy about the decision. “The kids saw on social media that a lot of
  Cambodians are going back home, so they wanted to as well,” she says. Social
  media commentaries have become increasingly incendiary and, at times, violent.
  In a viral TikTok clip, a Thai man appears to instruct young Cambodians to
  tell Hun Sen - the former Cambodian leader who remains extremely powerful –
  not to attack Thai people. When one of the group smiles, the man slaps him on
  camera. Hun Sen later shared the video on his Facebook page, warning
  Cambodians in Thailand to stay safe. Another video, shared widely online,
  apparently shows a group of Thai people beating up a man who is reportedly a
  Cambodian national. When two Cambodian women posted videos stamping on the
  Thai flag, part of a new social media trend, people demanded their
  deportation. Thai authorities have urged young people and social media
  influencers against inciting violence, but the bitterness has continued to be
  shared online. The South-east Asian neighbours have a long history of rivalry,
  especially arguments over the roots of their shared heritage. In 2003, when
  false rumours that a Thai soap opera actor had suggested Angkor Wat, a Unesco
  world heritage site, belonged to Thailand, riots erupted in Phnom Penh, and
  the Thai embassy set on fire. Diplomatic rows and social media storms have
  broken out periodically since. Two years ago, Thailand boycotted a kickboxing
  event at the South-East Asian Games in Cambodia after the discipline was
  called Kun Khmer rather than Thailand’s name for the sport, Muay Thai. Even
  well-meaning posts can spiral into online wars. The UK ambassador to Cambodia
  Dominic Williams inadvertently created a social media furore in 2023 when he
  posted a picture of some sweet treats on social media, captioned “Khmer
  dessert”. Thai people responded with a flood of angry comments claiming the
  snacks were in fact Thai. Social media, far more prevalent than the last time
  the border dispute erupted in 2008 and 2011, has inflamed tensions. Some have
  pushed back. A major hospital in Ubon Ratchathani province was forced to
  backtrack after it suspended services for new Cambodian patients and announced
  it would be strictly “zoning” existing Cambodian patients due to the recent
  fighting. Critics pointed out the policy was discriminatory. But online others
  supported the hospital. “Shall we help them get better so they can shoot at us
  again?” wrote one commentator. The public mood in Thailand – and pressure for
  Thai authorities to seek responsibility for Cambodian attacks on Thai
  civilians – could threaten the fragile ceasefire. Ken Lohatepanont, a
  political analyst in Thailand, says the ceasefire will probably hold for now,
  but the prospects in the medium and long term are less clear. “Thailand and
  Cambodia are still going to have a lot of border issues to resolve, because
  none of the core points of contention have actually been discussed so far,” he
  said. Both Thailand and Cambodia still insist on usingdifferent maps to
  demarcate the border. Da, who lives far from the border, in Rayong province,
  is mostly staying at home, going out only to buy food and work. “In my
  opinion, both sides have done things wrong – they need to find a way to speak
  peacefully,” she says. “I want the situation to go back to normal, to open the
  border gates so that Thai and Cambodian people can come together again.”
