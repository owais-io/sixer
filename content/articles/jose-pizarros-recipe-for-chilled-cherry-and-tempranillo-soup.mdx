  Cherries are a big deal in Extremadura, where I’m from, especially in the
  Valle del Jerte to the north, where the picotas are some of the best in all of
  Spain: sweet, dark, no stalk and full of flavour. At home, we usually just eat
  them by the handful, fresh and cold, so when I started cooking with them, my
  family looked at me as if I’d gone mad. But they always end up saying yes
  after the first spoonful. This chilled cherry and tempranillo soup is one of
  those dishes: a bit unexpected, but it always gets a smile. Chilled cherry and
  tempranillo soup, or sopa fría de cereza Fresh cherries are one of the joys of
  late summer, but this soup can also be made using frozen cherries at any time
  of year. Prep 25 min Chill 3 hr+ Serves 6 500g ripe cherries, pitted, plus a
  few extra to garnish 400ml tempranillo 50g caster sugar, or to taste 1 tsp
  vanilla bean paste ½ tsp ground cardamom A squeeze of lemon juice, or to taste
  Soured cream, or creme fraiche, to serve Put the cherries, wine, sugar and
  150ml cold water in a blender and blitz smooth. Stir in the vanilla, cardamom
  and lemon juice, then taste to check it’s sweet enough, or if it needs a touch
  more citrus. When the flavour is to your liking, pour into a jug or bowl,
  cover and chill for at least three hours. Serve the soup in shallow bowls
  topped with a spoonful of soured cream or creme fraiche.
