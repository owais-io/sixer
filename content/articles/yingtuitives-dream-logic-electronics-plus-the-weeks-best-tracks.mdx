  From Singapore/London Recommended if you like Fennesz, Four Tet, Laurel Halo
  Up next Ongoing monthly show on Noods Radio The baked floral scents and hot
  breezes of the UK’s mini heatwave this week pair perfectly with the work of
  Yingtuitive, AKA Singapore-raised, London-dwelling musician Hannah Chia –
  though you sense that her shifting, almost synaesthetic music will take on new
  colours in the drizzle or snow. Chia’s debut album Letters To Self 寫情書 was
  released late last month: recalling the bucolic electronics of early Four Tet
  but subtly nodding to a range of ambient and club sounds, it doesn’t ever
  settle into predictable emotional beats. Chia focuses on piano on tracks such
  as Pandan, poignant ambient jazz in the style of Matthew Bourne or Ryuichi
  Sakamoto; Blue, a study in thick, aqueous reverb; and Do U Forget a Feeling?,
  with more reverb set against a crisp beat, as if tapped out on an MPC sampler.
  It’s the first of three excellent rhythmic tracks at the album’s heart: make
  sure to stick Exhibition on the best system you can to appreciate the
  penetrating bass, as well as the melodic effects which recall grime
  productions (especially Skepta’s signature video-game squelch). As this
  cosmopolitan album plays through, it’s like being carried with dream logic
  from garden to mall to club and back again. Chia has said the album is, in
  part, borne out of “a contemplation of a split soul from living between two
  places for so long”. She captures the poignancy of living so restlessly,
  seeing such varied beauty, but never fully building a life around it. Ben
  Beaumont-Thomas This week’s best new tracks Dijon – Higher! After co-writing
  Justin Bieber’s recent UK No 1 Daisies, the R&amp;B musician follows up with
  his own astounding, surprise-dropped second album. Higher! is charged with
  gospel fervour, and touched with greatness. BBT William Tyler and Claire
  Rousay – Covert Services The Nashville guitarist’s recent foray into haunted
  ambience makes him a perfect match for the Canadian experimentalist, though
  the result is surprisingly poppy, like a whacked-out Alex G. LS Militarie Gun
  – B A D I D E A Hardcore punk’s Hot To Go!? Those letters are chanted as if by
  a demotivational cheerleader squad, as the brilliant LA band return with 109
  seconds of pop-minded pogoing. BBT The Belair Lip Bombs – Hey You The Third
  Man-signed Aussies tone down their debut’s power-pop euphoria for this tough
  confrontation of a relationship on its uppers, produced by Joe White of their
  equally excellent countrymen Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever. LS Just Mustard
  – We Were Just Here The only trace of dream pop left around the Irish band
  here is in Katie Ball’s searching vocals; the music buzzes, vibrates and
  grinds like a city electrified. LS Neko Case – Winchester Mansion of Sound A
  very Neko devotional: comparing a wild friend with “too much life for just one
  body” to a haunted mansion, seemingly played on its piano and swooping through
  its ballrooms. LS Chy Cartier – Miu Miu A masterclass in rap hook-writing from
  the north London MC, her rhyme scheme locking with perfect symmetry as she
  trumpets her purchasing power, not forgetting a Merc for mum. BBT Subscribe to
