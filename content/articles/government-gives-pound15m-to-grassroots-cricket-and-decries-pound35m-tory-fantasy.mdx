  The government has watered down its predecessor’s pledge of a £35m investment
  to build grassroots cricket facilities and widen access for state school
  pupils after describing the previous government’s announcement as a “fantasy”.
  Under an alternative plan announced on Monday, the Department for Digital,
  Culture, Media and Sport has given £1.5m to the England and Wales Cricket
  Board to build two indoor domes in Luton and Preston, but it is understood
  that the rest of the money may not materialise. The former prime minister
  Rishi Sunak had announced a £35m package for 22 purpose-built cricket domes at
  a launch event at the Oval before the general election last year, along with
  further plans to expand the scheme to 40 or more. Intense lobbying efforts
  since Labour was elected last summer have resulted in sufficient funds to
  build two domes, which provide all-year-round, all-weather practice and
  match-play facilities in a covered environment at an affordable price. Lisa
  Nandy, the culture secretary, said: “Unfortunately the announcement made by
  the last government was a fantasy. There was not a single penny of actual
  funding attached to it. We are backing sport because we know how much it
  matters. It changes people’s lives.” Despite no commitment from Labour for
  further funding, the ECB plans to continue pushing for additional money next
  year to coincide with England’s staging of the Women’s T20 World Cup, the
  final of which will be held at Lord’s for the first time. The ECB chair,
  Richard Thompson, welcomed the initial investment and expressed hope that more
  would follow to ensure a legacy of more widespread and diverse participation
  follows the World Cup. “We are pleased to secure government support for these
  incredible community facilities, which we hope will provide a vital proof
  point of what can be achieved, and look forward to future collaboration,”
  Thompson said. “As we look ahead to hosting the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in
  2026, building on that success by rolling out more domes in communities across
  England and Wales will be key to creating a genuine and lasting legacy from
  the tournament. “These state-of-the-art all-weather cricket domes will be
  transformative for the communities they serve, opening up cricket to more
  people year-round and providing top-class facilities for elite players too.
  They are an important part of our plans to break down barriers and make
  cricket the most inclusive team sport.” The ECB’s target is to get an extra
  900,000 young people playing cricket by 2029, with the domes an integral part
  of its Plan for Change as they are to be built in urban areas targeting
  children who do not play cricket at school, many from diverse and
  underprivileged backgrounds. The domes have been designed by the ECB in
  collaboration with Total-play, a cricket facility specialist. Luton and
  Preston have been chosen for the domes, which are due to open next year, as
  they will provide easy access for hard‑to‑reach social groups. The ECB
  estimates that adding another 20 domes in the future could ensure the scheme
  reaches 4m children who don’t play cricket. If more funding is secured the ECB
  would seek to build domes in cities staging games at the World Cup next year –
  Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Southampton, Bristol and London. “The greatest
  example of social cohesion is when you see white working-class lads playing
  with Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, it cuts
  through the divides in an extraordinary way,” Thompson said. “This isn’t so
  much about sport. This is about society and where sport can solve some of
  society’s ills.” The announcement on Monday is part of the government’s wider
  National Youth Strategy, which will be published this autumn.
