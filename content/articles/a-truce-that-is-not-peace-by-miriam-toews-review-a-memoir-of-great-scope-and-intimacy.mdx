  Asking himself “Why I write”, George Orwell gave four reasons: aesthetic
  enthusiasm, historical impulse, political purpose and sheer egoism. Asked the
  same question ahead of a literary conference in Mexico City, Miriam Toews
  mentions the teenage letters she sent from Europe to her sister Marjorie (Marj
  or M as she calls her) as the reason she became a writer. Sorry, that won’t do
  for an answer, she’s told. Try again. In a frenetic household set-up in
  Toronto, keeping an eye on her mother one moment, entertaining her
  grandchildren the next and warding off angry neighbours in between, she
  struggles to get her act together and makes a to-do list: “Wind Museum.
  Deranged skunk. North-west quadrant with ex. Conversación in Mexico City.” The
  skunk has distemper and keeps getting trapped in the window well. The Wind
  Museum is the collection she’d love to create, commemorating winds from all
  over the world (Harmattan, Calima, Mistral, Sirocco etc), if she can find a
  way to exhibit them. The ex is the father of her second child, who despite
  years of separation is still taking the royalties on her work – it’s time to
  meet him and end that arrangement. Most pressing, though, is the Mexico City
  business. Since early childhood she has been “afflicted” with a need to write
  things down: “the fingers in my mind would begin typing”, and she’d carry on
  all day, touch-typing in her head, “as though that were the only way of
  proving to myself that I was alive, that what I was experiencing was real”.
  That could be an answer of sorts. Too late, though: she’s disinvited from the
  conference; the word CANCELLED appears across her photo in the programme. A
  hopeless failure, then. But this book is a triumph – a meditation on writing,
  suicide, guilt and silence; a fragmented account of her life so far; and an
  illustration of why she’s one of Canada’s most admired writers (there’s now a
  plaque outside her former home in Steinbach, Manitoba, where she grew up as
  part of a Mennonite community). Though the Mexico City organiser missed the
  point, those letters to her sister were indeed her prime reason for writing.
  “Why do I write? Because she asked me to.” That was the deal they made. “You
  live. And I’ll write.” Marj suffered from depression and in 2010 she killed
  herself, 12 years after their father Melvin had done the same. Toews wrote
  about Melvin, in his voice, in her book Swing Low (2000) and her relationship
  with Marj formed the basis for her novel All My Puny Sorrows (2014). Most of
  her work until now has been loosely autofictional. This time there are no
  disguises. She tells it as it is. “You people (meaning, my family) don’t talk
  about your pain,” Toews’s partner tells her, “you just kill yourselves.” Toews
  herself came close to doing so one day while walking by the river Assiniboine,
  in Winnipeg, but rather than throwing herself in the water she threw her
  mobile phone instead. “A parable of perfect silence,” she calls it, but it’s
  her sister’s silence that preoccupies her – all those years before she died
  when she didn’t speak. “Was my sister’s silence an attempt to translate
  something that couldn’t be said? Something that would cause too much pain if
  it were to be said?’ The questions keep coming, with Toews disinclined to
  present writing (“this strange non-thing”) as any more creative or worthwhile
  than her sister’s wordlessness: “If silence says more, why write?” As a hymn
  to their intimacy, maybe the writing did help keep her sister alive. The
  letters she sent from Europe, which come in a brilliant run of 30 pages late
  on in the book, date back to 1982, when Toews was travelling with her
  boyfriend Wolfie. The two of them are hard up and she’s increasingly
  disenchanted with him, not least when he busks with a penny whistle in Covent
  Garden (no, she won’t hold out a beret for coins) or queues to get a book
  signed by John Fowles when they haven’t the money for food. In Oxford she lies
  on the grass, unaware there’s a cricket match going on. In Paris they’re
  chased out of a park by guards with whistles. In Rouen their bikes are stolen.
  In Corfu they’re pelted with pomegranates by a gang of children. They fall
  out, make up by having outdoor sex (“I still have tiny pieces of rock ground
  heroically into my back and ass”), fall out again. It’s hilarious. And she’s
  only 18. “Do you think I’ll soon be enjoying liquid lunches at the Algonquin
  Round Table, hahahaha.” The hahahaha principle defines Toews. “Between you and
  me, I want to be a clown. I think I am a clown,” she tells Marj. It’s an
  inherited trait perhaps. Despite the sadness and depression, there’s a lot of
  laughter in the family, including an episode when they take a boat out to an
  uninhabited island, disembark for a picnic and return to find the boat has
  disappeared – rather than wail they all begin to laugh (later, miraculously,
  the boat drifts back to shore). Toews’s mother, a Scrabble genius, remains
  indomitably cheerful despite her losses, and is arguably the heroine of the
  book. “Narrative as something dirty, to be avoided – I understand this,” Toews
  writes, and she does avoid it, up to a point, bobbing about in time and place,
  riffing on the Wind Museum, recounting how she refused to marry the father of
  her son and broke up with the father of her daughter. The awful and the
  laughable overlap. Her sister is attacked by a carful of young men and
  drenched in rancid brown liquid. Their mother is kidnapped and robbed. Their
  father doesn’t speak for a year. It might sink a less buoyant spirit but Toews
  makes comedy out of the chaos. She does the same when she talks about her
  writing career. On a cruise with her mother, the pages of her manuscript are
  blown from the floor of her cabin into the sea. Her very first reading in
  another city is cancelled when the poet in charge runs off with her lover –
  Toews is left to sleep for three nights on a blow-up mattress in a garden
  shed. Her very existence is farcical: she was conceived on the night of her
  grandfather’s funeral, in a marital effort to ward off morbidity. Why were her
  father and sister so silent, she asks her mother. “That’s easy, she replies,
  it was something they could control.” For Toews, writing serves the same
  purpose. She’s wired, anxious, on an adrenalin high and prone to panic
  attacks, “crazy with grief, guilt and dread”. Having to write dismays her.
  She’d love to stop obsessing about word order and become “a benign but wise
  grandmother, with a soft lap”. Then again, from what we see of her with her
  grandchildren, she is that anyway. Meanwhile, writing absorbs her sorrow and
  rage. “Are you OK? I mean, you know, OK? I miss you so much,” Toews writes to
  her sister. “I wish I could take your sadness away.” She’s still trying, all
  these years later, closing with a 2023 letter to Marj (“You’ll like this”)
  about a stranger arriving at a Christmas Eve family gathering and being made
  welcome, though it turns out he has not been invited. There’s Toews for you.
  Her work’s so intimate you worry you’re intruding, but it’s fine, she welcomes
  you in. A Truce That Is Not Peace by Miriam Toews is published by 4th Estate
  (£16.99). To support the Guardian order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
