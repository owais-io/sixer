  Toothless and frail, Gloria Palacios, 84, stooped as she set up her rickety
  sidewalk shop in Mexico City’s roughshod Doctores neighborhood. On sale:
  peanuts, cigarettes, chewing gum, chocolates and chips. When asked how much
  she made in a day, Palacios’s disabled son Gustavo, who helps run the tiny
  store, simply laughed. “If we make 100 pesos ($5) it’s a lot,” he said.
  Happily, said Palacios, the family has a different lifeline. With their house
  crumbling and bills piling up, the only thing keeping them afloat is a
  bimonthly transfer of 6,200 pesos ($330) implemented by the government of
  previous president Andrés Manuel López Obrador for adults over 65. “God bless
  López Obrador,” said Palacios. “Without him what would we do? I think we
  wouldn’t even have enough to eat.” Palacios is one of millions of people
  across Mexico who have benefited from the welfare policies of López Obrador,
  or Amlo as he’s commonly known. And now, thanks to a report released last week
  by the country’s national statistics agency, we know just how effective those
  policies were. When Amlo took office in 2018, there were nearly 52 million
  people living below the poverty line: by the time he left office six years
  later, that number had dropped by 13.4 million, a decrease of almost 26%.
  Extreme poverty also dropped from nearly 9 million people to just 7 million.
  In a country that has long suffered from deep inequality and struggled with
  economic precarity, the steep drop in the number of people living in poverty
  is a remarkable achievement and suggests Amlo’s policies had a measurable
  impact on the lives of millions of everyday Mexicans. “It’s something
  extraordinary, historic, the reduction [of poverty],” said Amlo’s successor
  and ally Claudia Sheinbaum during a news conference on Thursday. “‘For the
  good of all – first the poor’ is not just a slogan, but a reality in Mexico.”
  Some independent Mexican analysts have been equally enthusiastic about the
  poverty reductions achieved under Amlo. “There has never been a single
  six-year term in which poverty has been reduced or decreased so
  significantly,” said Viri Ríos, a public policy expert and director of Mexico
  Decoded. “This is a watershed moment for the Mexican economy.” Amlo was
  elected in a 2018 landslide with a promise to eradicate corruption and tackle
  inequality. Among the legacies of his administration were the tripling of the
  minimum wage from 88.40 pesos ($4.75) per day when he took office to the
  current rate of 278.80 pesos ($15) a day. This had a knock-on effect on other
  sectors of the economy, according to Valeria Moy, a Mexican economist and
  director general of IMCO, a public policy thinktank. “When the minimum wage
  increases, other wages and incomes in the economy begin to rise – even in the
  informal economy – because there is a greater availability of resources,” she
  said. “I don’t know if the [poverty reduction] was purely because of López
  Obrador’s policies, but I do think the push in the minimum wage moved the
  rest.” Ríos was more emphatic. “We’re talking about a labor market that had a
  minimum wage well below the standard of living,” she said. “And now it’s
  reached a level that allows 13.4 million families to escape poverty. It’s a
  historic achievement.” Amlo also transformed the social welfare system,
  implementing a system of cash transfers for elderly people, like Palacios, for
  young people doing apprenticeships and for farmers planting fruit trees, among
  others. He then doubled the amount spent on these transfers. The universal
  cash transfer system, which replaced a well-regarded conditional system for
  the poorest fifth of households requiring children to go to school and
  families to attend health check-ups, has received some criticism as it meant
  that, in the case of the pension system for example, anyone, even well-off
  Mexicans over 65, were entitled to a transfer. “We lost focus and lost the
  ability to give to the poorest,” said Gonzalo Hernández Licona, the former
  head of the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy
  (CONEVAL), a now defunct agency which used to measure poverty before the task
  was transferred to the statistics institute. “While the amount has grown, the
  way the amount is distributed has worsened.” This might help explain why the
  19% reduction in extreme poverty was much lower than the nearly 26% reduction
  in overall poverty. Many of the poorest Mexicans live in remote rural places,
  where accessing social welfare is hard if not impossible. “The big problem
  [with the cash transfers] is not that they’re universal,” said Ríos. “The big
  problem is that the Mexican government has not made an effort to make it truly
  universal – that is, to make it reach everyone.” Meanwhile, the report from
  the statistics agency also revealed other glaring issues under Amlo’s
  government: while access to food security, social security and dignified
  living conditions all increased, the number of people without access to health
  services more than doubled, from 20.1 million people in 2018 to more than 44
  million in 2024. “I think the great debt that the Mexican state still owes its
  people is improving access to healthcare,” said Ríos. “As a percentage of GDP,
  our spending on health is similar to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.”
  Palacios, who has considerable medical expenses but no access to medical
  insurance said she felt “horrible”. “Medicines are so expensive,” she said.
  “And I don’t have anything.” Sheinbaum admitted there was still more work to
  do. “Do we still have progress to make? Yes,” she said. “With 30% of Mexico’s
  population living in poverty, we obviously have to keep moving forward.”
