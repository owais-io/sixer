  Voting is underway in the leadership contest for the Green party of England
  and Wales. Current party co-leader Adrian Ramsay has teamed up with MP Ellie
  Chowns, after Carla Denyer decided not to stand for re-election. The party
  membership will have to decide between the Ramsay and Chowns ticket or the
  Green party’s current deputy leader, Zack Polanski. Ramsay, who was elected as
  Green party MP for Waveney Valley in 2024, has been co-leader since 2021. He
  was previously the deputy leader of the Green party of England and Wales from
  2008 to 2012. Chowns, Green party MP for North Herefordshire, won her seat
  last year. A former MEP for the West Midlands for the party, she was a
  councillor on Herefordshire Council from 2017 and leader of the council’s
  Green group until she stepped down following her election to parliament.
  Ramsay and Chowns are highlighting their many years of experience in politics,
  saying they want to “turn values into power”. Polanski, who describes himself
  as an “eco-populist”, has been the deputy leader of the Green party of England
  and Wales since 2022. He has been a member of the London Assembly since May
  2021. He says he is the candidate who can “scale up and diversify” the party.
  Members of the party can vote until Saturday, 30 August. Results will be
  announced on Tuesday, 2 September. What questions would you like us to put to
  the candidates? Let us know. We’ll publish some of your questions and their
  answers.
