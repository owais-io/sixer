  Within the corridors of a psychiatric ward in Beaujon hospital in Clichy,
  Paris, tensions run high. Every day, a steady stream of patients pours in,
  while resources are stretched pitifully thin. Through jagged handheld
  cinematography, Nicolas Peduzzi’s gripping and passionate documentary reflects
  the facility’s breakneck pace. Amid a flurry of frantic calls and rolling
  stretchers, a calm presence emerges: here comes Dr Jamal Abdel-Kader, the only
  staff psychiatrist in the building. The camera trails after Abdel-Kader’s
  hurried steps as he splits his day between various departments, from the
  emergency rooms to the intensive care units. Despite his colossal workload – a
  result of crumbling infrastructure and lack of government budget – he devotes
  his full attention to each individual patient. Some are only in their late
  teens when they attempt self-harm and even suicide. Others have already spent
  a lifetime trapped in a cycle of addiction and depression. Although their
  situations vary, the patients’ circumstances all point to structural issues in
  France’s treatment of mental health. Abdel-Kader perceives the private
  struggles of his patients not simply as personal failings, but as symptoms of
  an indifferent society, in which people have forgotten how to care for one
  another. Besides medical intervention, his treatment also includes other forms
  of therapy, including creative sessions where people gather to study Molière
  and Shakespeare. Abdel-Kader’s conversations with colleagues reveal that the
  loneliness endured by the patients also extends to the overworked physicians,
  who are undersupported by the state. These moments of introspection at the
  hospital, expressed in black-and-white snapshots, lend a human touch to spaces
  that are still painfully stigmatised in the public eye. In contrast to the
  outside world driven by productivity and prejudice, here is where care and
  understanding still exist, against all odds. • On the Edge is on True Story
  from 22 August.
