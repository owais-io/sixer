  For years before I became the public editor at the New York Times, I admired
  the work of journalists doing the job of holding their own newsrooms
  accountable to high standards. And when I heard that CBS News would get a
  position something like that, I thought – briefly – that this could be a
  positive development. After all, the network’s credibility and independence
  has come under fire after its parent company settled a frivolous lawsuit
  brought by Donald Trump. Paramount Global, the CBS parent company, was bashed
  for capitulating to political pressure in order to get federal approval for a
  merger with another media company. I quickly changed my mind once I learned
  the details. This is not a traditional ombudsman but what some have dubbed a
  “bias monitor” who will receive and evaluate claims of bias in the network’s
  journalism and report on them to the corporation’s president. Appointing such
  a person was part of the FCC’s recent approval of Paramount’s merger with
  Skydance. Other conditions included agreeing to Trump priorities such as
  rooting out diversity programs. The new job “seems designed to ensure little
  critical is aired about the current administration”, said Glenn Kessler, the
  longtime Washington Post journalist and editor of the Fact Checker, who is now
  writing a Substack newsletter. Kessler also noted that the Trump-appointed FCC
  chair, Brendan Carr, in commenting on the new position, compared it to the
  creation of an ombudsman decades ago when General Electric bought NBC. But
  that regulator was designed to ensure NBC’s editorial independence and to
  guard against interference from the new owner, a business conglomerate. In
  sharp contrast, Kessler told me, this “newfangled ombudsman suggests CBS will
  not have independence from political interference”. Public editors are there
  to serve the reader and to provide transparency and accountability. It’s to
  the Guardian’s credit that it maintains a “readers’ editor”; NPR boasts a
  similar position. Elisabeth Ribbans recently unpacked how the Guardian handled
  a controversial story about a malnourished child in Gaza; Kelly McBride
  examined complaints that NPR had failed to give sufficient coverage to
  anti-Trump demonstrations. But many news organizations have terminated the
  role, sometimes stating that it is redundant since social media gives voice to
  critics. I never bought that explanation. Public editors can do something that
  even the most impassioned outside critics can’t do – get response from
  internal decision makers, consider all points of view, and publish their
  conclusions on the very site in which the journalism originally appeared.
  Decades ago at the Washington Post, Bill Green did an exemplary investigation
  of how the paper came to publish “Jimmy’s World” – a fabricated story about an
  eight-year-old heroin addict. The Post gave him free rein and then published
  his 18,000-word findings over several pages. At the New York Times, Clark Hoyt
  wrote columns criticizing the overuse of anonymous sources and considering
  complaints about how the Jerusalem bureau chief’s son had served in the
  Israeli military. Job requirements for public editors, therefore, include
  fairness, independence and a thick skin. The Times position was sometimes
  called “the worst job in journalism” because you were often writing something
  that would tick off your newsroom colleagues. That didn’t scare me. When I
  heard, in 2012, that the Times job was going to be open, I applied and got the
  gig. My nearly four years weren’t easy, but I had the great advantage of a
  publisher – Arthur O Sulzberger Jr – who believed in the role and supported my
  work. The best part by far was hearing from Times readers how much they
  appreciated the opportunity to be heard, and to understand what was going on
  behind the scenes. I always felt I reported not to the newsroom editors, or to
  Sulzberger, but to the Times readership. I was disappointed when the paper –
  on the verge of getting a new publisher in Sulzberger’s son – decided to
  abolish the role in 2017. By then, I had settled into my new job as Washington
  Post media columnist; there was no ombudsman there any more. The Post had
  ended that role a few years earlier. In both cases, I thought it was a loss
  for readers, for credibility and even for the papers’ own staffs, who often
  appreciated the work, especially when they weren’t the ones under the
  magnifying glass. It’s simple, really. As journalists, we hold others to
  account. A good public editor can do the same for the newsroom itself. But a
  “bias monitor” set up in a highly politicized environment – as part of
  corporate maneuvering to clear the path for a merger – is not designed to
  continue that tradition. Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing
  on media, politics and culture
