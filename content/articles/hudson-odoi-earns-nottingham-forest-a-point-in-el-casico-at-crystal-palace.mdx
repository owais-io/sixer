  It had been billed as “El Casico”. But after crossing swords with Nottingham
  Forest at the court of arbitration for sport following Uefa’s decision to
  demote them from the Europa League, Crystal Palace couldn’t find a way to beat
  them on the pitch. Public enemy No 1 in this part of south London after his
  perceived role in the Cas verdict, Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis was
  conspicuous by his absence at Selhurst Park, although a phalanx of beefy
  security guards accompanied the visiting players when they arrived. A banner
  that was unveiled midway through the first half made clear the animosity of
  the Palace fans towards Marinakis. But having fallen behind to Ismaïla Sarr’s
  opener, a 57th-minute equaliser from Callum Hudson-Odoi earned a point for
  Nuno Espírito Santo’s side after a week that has seen the Forest manager at
  loggerheads with his owner. It would have been some irony if substitute Igor
  Jesus – who arrived from Botafogo, one of Palace’s former part-owner John
  Textor’s other clubs in his multi-club network that caused all the problems
  with Uefa – had scored rather than striking the post in injury time when clean
  through. But in their first match since Eberechi Eze’s departure to Arsenal
  was confirmed, Oliver Glasner will have been left concerned that his side ran
  out of steam in the second half following their exertions in the Conference
  League playoff in midweek. New signings are imperative before the window
  closes. Nuno had insisted beforehand that he wants to carry on at Forest
  despite revealing on Friday that his relationship with Marinakis is “not the
  same”, amid reports of disagreements with new sporting director Edu Gaspar. He
  said they are planning to sit down this week to try to iron things out: “We
  have to communicate and approach the final days of the market.” The signing of
  four new players last week for more than £90m does not seem to have been
  enough to satisfy Nuno’s demands, with all of them named on the bench. In
  comparison, as if to underline their lack of activity in the transfer market
  after Eze’s departure, Glasner selected two goalkeepers and academy graduate
  Kaden Rodney. Palace’s supporters unveiled a special tifo as the teams emerged
  with a giant image of former captain Joel Ward lifting the FA Cup with the
  message: “Built from glass – etched in silver.” It didn’t take long for
  Forest’s travelling supporters to make themselves heard. “Marinakis he does
  what he wants” was given an early airing, with virtually all of Palace’s fans
  responding with a chant about Uefa that has become the anthem of their summer.
  Temperatures weren’t quite as raised on the pitch, with Forest making the more
  promising start in a fixture that is not usually noted for being a goalfest,
  with Chris Wood firing wide from close range. Palace slowly found their rhythm
  and Jean-Philippe Mateta forced Matz Sels into a save with a shot from outside
  the area. Gibbs-White should have done better from Wood’s clever cutback but
  could only clear the crossbar by a mile. Palace took the lead eight minutes
  before half-time when Forest failed to clear Tyrick Mitchell’s cross and it
  was quickly recycled to Daniel Muñoz by Adam Wharton. The Colombian’s cross
  was inch-perfect for Sarr to tuck home. It could have got even better for the
  hosts had a powerful drive from Will Hughes not whistled just past a post
  before captain Marc Guéhi struck a post with a header just before half-time.
  Forest are always a dangerous proposition on the break, however, and after a
  strong start to the second half, Palace were hit by a sucker punch. Dan
  Ndoye’s crossfield ball caught Mitchell napping and Hudson-Odoi was able to
  muscle his way into the area and beat Dean Henderson at his near post.
  Watching on from the stands, Thomas Tuchel will have been intrigued to see the
  midfield battle between Wharton and the impressive Elliot Anderson, with
  honours just about shared. James McAtee – who captained England’s Under-21s to
  retain their European title in the summer – made his debut as Forest smelled
  blood, with fellow new boys Arnaud Kalimuendo and Omari Hutchinson also being
  introduced. Glasner had been downbeat on Romain Esse’s chances of filling
  Eze’s boots but the 20-year-old, who joined from Millwall in January, showed
  glimpses of his talent when he came on that could bode well for the future.
  Yet Forest could have snatched it at the death through Igor Jesus, although
  they still maintained their record of not having lost here since 2003.
