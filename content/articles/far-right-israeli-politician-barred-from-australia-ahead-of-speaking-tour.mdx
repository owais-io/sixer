  A far-right Israeli politician, who has described Palestinian children in Gaza
  as “enemies” and called for Israel’s total control of the West Bank, has been
  denied entry into Australia ahead of an upcoming “solidarity tour”. Simcha
  Rothman, a member of the Knesset for the far-right party Religious Zionism,
  was scheduled to appear at two public events in Sydney and Melbourne in August
  and two private events billed as a “solidarity tour”. The home affairs
  minister, Tony Burke, confirmed on Monday Rothman’s visa application had been
  cancelled and he would not be able to apply for another one for three years.
  Guardian Australia first put questions to his office on Friday morning. “Our
  government takes a hard line on people who seek to come to our country and
  spread division,” Burke said in a statement. “If you are coming to Australia
  to spread a message of hate and division, we don’t want you here. “Under our
  government, Australia will be a country where everyone can be safe, and feel
  safe.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Rothman accused the Albanese government
  of “clear and blatant antisemitism” in a post written in Hebrew on X shortly
  after the decision was made public. Rothman said the home affairs minister had
  informed him his “presence and words will have a serious impact on peace and
  the rule of law in Australia”. “This antisemitic decision is not directed at
  me. It is directed at the Jewish community in Australia, at the state of
  Israel and at the people of Israel,” he wrote. “The state of Israel learned
  the hard price of surrendering to terrorism on October 7th – the Australian
  government has not yet learned that lesson and the price to be paid for it
  will be heavy.” Rothman is a member of the Netanyahu government’s coalition
  and his party’s leader, Bezalel Smotrich, is the finance minister, who was
  sanctioned by the Albanese government in June alongside Israel’s national
  security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. The events with Rothman, organised by the
  right-leaning Australian Jewish Association (AJA), were described as a
  “solidarity tour to show support for Australia’s Jewish community”.
  “Australian Jews are experiencing unprecedented antisemitism. Many feel that
  the Australian government has abandoned the Jewish community,” the group’s
  event description read. “Simcha is an excellent speaker and will be sharing
  words of support for the Jewish community as well as providing an update from
  Israel.” Burke has previously barred the entry of other personalities and
  politicians with a history of controversial or offensive statements, including
  the rapper Kanye West, the US law professor Khaled Beydoun and the former
  Israeli minister Ayelet Shaked. The progressive Jewish Council of Australia
  said it had been “deeply concerned” by Rothman’s planned visit, claiming it
  was “part of an effort to encourage support for the Israeli government”. Bart
  Shteinman, a council spokesperson, said Rothman’s visit was a reminder of “how
  shallow and incomplete” Australia’s response to the Israeli government has
  been. The AJA’s chief executive, Robert Gregory, dismissed the council’s
  criticism and said Rothman’s trip to Australia was “not connected to current
  events in the Middle East”. “In general, AJA does not take positions on every
  statement made by past speakers, but as a community organisation we believe in
  giving the Jewish community the opportunity to hear from Israeli and
  Australian decision-makers across the political spectrum,” Gregory said in a
  statement before Rothman’s visa was rejected. Rothman did not respond to email
  requests for comment. Smotrich, Rothman’s party leader, took to X to show his
  support, stating an intention to “continue to proudly voice Israel’s stance.
  We won’t stop until complete victory.” Ben-Gvir, who has also been sanctioned
  by the Australian government, said on X Rothman’s visa cancellation was a
  “historical stain and a shame for the Australian government”. Israel’s
  diaspora minister, Amichai Chikli, said Australia’s decision reflected a
  “broken moral compass, discrimination, and a grave assault on free speech”.
  Rothman is an outspoken critic of a two-state solution and has supported
  Donald Trump’s proposal to remove Palestinians from Gaza, citing security
  concerns for Israel. In a May interview with the UK’s Channel 4, he claimed
  children within Gaza were “enemies” who should not be allowed to flee into
  Israel as “you don’t let them conquer your country with refugees”. “They are
  our enemies and according to international treaties about refugees in the time
  of war, you don’t let them conquer your country with refugees,” Rothman said.
  Rothman was one of a handful of Knesset members who initiated a symbolic
  motion in July to “apply” Israel’s sovereignty to the occupied West Bank
  territory. The motion passed 71-13. In a social media post shortly after,
  Rothman said applying Israel’s sovereignty to the occupied territory would
  make it clear to the world that the land belongs to the people of Israel
  “today, tomorrow and forever”. Rothman is also the architect of a bill to
  formally change all references to the West Bank in legislation to the
  preferred historical Israeli name, Judea and Samaria. The bill’s explanatory
  notes say the change will “rectify a historical injustice that was created by
  foreigners” and “conforms to the general trend of strengthening the Israeli
  linkage to the region and safeguarding the Jewish people’s historical rights”.
  Rothman played a controversial role in Israel spearheading a movement to allow
  a Knesset majority to override almost any supreme court rulings, and to allow
  politicians to appoint most of the justices to the bench. The Netanyahu
  government proposal sparked protests in 2023 within Israel in the months
  before the 7 October attack on southern Israel by Palestinian militant group,
  Hamas, leading to political instability.
