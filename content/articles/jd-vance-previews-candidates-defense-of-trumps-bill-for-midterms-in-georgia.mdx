  The US vice-president, JD Vance, previewed in Georgia on Thursday the lines of
  attack candidates will use to defend the president’s signature One Big
  Beautiful Bill Act in the midterms next year, calling it “the biggest tax cut
  for families that this country has ever seen”. Vance touted an increase in the
  child tax credit, the elimination of taxes on overtime and on tips in the One
  Big Beautiful Bill Act while speaking in a warehouse for ATLA Refrigeration in
  Peachtree City, Georgia. Vance did not mention that only the first $25,000 of
  tips will be tax free and will require itemization to claim, something few
  service workers do because the standard deduction usually provides a larger
  benefit. Eliminating overtime taxes also applies to the first $12,500 of a
  filer’s overtime income, phasing out at $150,000 of income. The increase in
  the child tax credit is $200 a child under 17 to $2,200, which will now be
  indexed to inflation. The event also served as a preview of the attacks Jon
  Ossof, the Georgia Democratic senator, will face in the bruising swing state
  battle to come next year. The White House paired Vance’s appearance with an
  information blitz on the “working families” tax cut. Ossoff would come to
  regret voting against the bill, Vance said. “In about a year, you are not
  going to be able to turn on the television without Senator John Ossoff
  pretending that he supported the working families tax cut, when in reality he
  voted against them,” Vance said. Vance extolled the virtues of the
  federalization of policing in Washington DC, and spoke at length about making
  places like Atlanta “safe” for out-of-town visitors to its downtown
  attractions. “The compassionate thing is to have people who are having mental
  health crises to get them in treatment, not to let them sit on the streets and
  yell at our people while they’re walking,” Vance said, when asked where
  federal agents were taking people swept up from encampments in the nation’s
  capitol. “The president actually signed an executive order to make it easier
  for some of these people to get access to mental health treatment. And I don’t
  know for the life of me what happened in this country where we decided that
  the compassionate thing was to let somebody fester on the streets instead of
  getting them treatment. And I don’t know why we accept it as parents and
  grandparents, as people who just want to walk down the street in comfort, why
  we accepted that it was reasonable to have crazy people yelling at our kids.”
  Vance also rejected observations that the bill would throw people out of their
  healthcare plans. “The President of the United States made a promise, a sacred
  promise, that the only people who are going to lose access to healthcare are
  illegal aliens who shouldn’t be in this country in the first place,” he said.
  “I happen to believe that when you are struggling in this country, we’re a
  generous people. We want to help you, or we want to help the people who have
  the legal right to be in the United States of America. So it’s not about
  kicking people off of health care. It’s about kicking illegal aliens the hell
  out of this country to preserve healthcare in America.” Comprehensive Medicaid
  benefits have never been available to undocumented immigrants. The budget bill
  cuts $1tn from Medicaid spending, beginning in 2027. About 17 million people
  are expected to lose health insurance by 2034 across the country if the
  provisions remain as enacted, according to estimates from the non-partisan
  Congressional Budget Office. Nearly 12 million people will lose insurance
  because of attacks on Medicaid. Nonetheless, a roster of speakers addressed
  the party faithful from the stage, three of whom – the Georgia representatives
  Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, and Derek Dooley, the former Tennessee football
  coach, – are candidates for the US Senate, vying for a face-off with Ossoff.
  Dooley is a political newcomer with the endorsement of both Trump and
  Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp. He likened his political outsider
  status to that of Trump, who “didn’t accept business as usual up there. And
  look at the results we got.”
