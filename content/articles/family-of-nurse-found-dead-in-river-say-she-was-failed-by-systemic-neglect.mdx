  The family of a nurse whose body was found in a river after a three-week
  search have said she was failed by “systemic neglect and under-resourcing in
  mental health services”. Victoria Taylor, 34, was described at an inquest as a
  “devoted mother, a loving fiancee and a fiercely loyal sister”. She went
  missing from her home in Malton, North Yorkshire, on 30 September last year.
  Her body was recovered from the River Derwent on 22 October after an extensive
  search. The inquest into her death in Northallerton heard that Taylor
  struggled with alcohol and mental health problems related to a childhood
  trauma. Coroner Catherine Cundy said the trauma left “an indelible mark” on
  Taylor’s life “in the form of depression, anxiety and chronic feelings of
  worthlessness”. Recording a narrative verdict, Cundy said she could not be
  sure of Taylor’s intentions when she went into the river. In a statement
  issued afterwards, Taylor’s sister, Emma Worden, said she hoped the inquest
  would be a turning point. She said: “Vixx was a devoted mother, a loving
  fiancee and a fiercely loyal sister. She showed up for those she loved with
  warmth, humour and a deep sense of care. “Her relationships were central to
  her identity, and she gave everything she had to protect and support the
  people around her. She also lived with challenges, these were not hidden. “She
  reached out for help. She made herself visible to services. And yet, time and
  again, she was failed and left without the support she needed. The failures in
  her care were not isolated incidents. They were part of a wider pattern of
  systemic neglect and under-resourcing in mental health services. “Vixx
  deserved better. She deserved to be seen, heard and supported. Instead, she
  was left to carry burdens alone. Her death is a tragedy, but it must also be a
  turning point. Let this inquest be a step toward accountability, learning and
  change.” During the daylong inquest Worden turned to representatives of Tees,
  Esk and Wear Valleys NHS foundation trust (TEWV) saying they were going “round
  in circles”. She said: “Nobody looked her in the eye and said: ‘We will help
  you,’ and she’s not here now because you failed her.” The coroner said she
  would be writing to TEWV and a number of other agencies with her concerns over
  the support Taylor was given. She said she found it “difficult to understand”
  why community mental health services repeatedly declined to offer Taylor
  support as her situation deteriorated during 2024. Cundy said she believed
  this was partly because Taylor was treated as an alcoholic when she was not
  dependent on alcohol, instead being someone who binged on wine when her
  emotions relating to her traumatic past overwhelmed her. Elspeth Devanney, the
  group director for nursing and quality at TEWV, said: “Our thoughts and
  deepest condolences are with Victoria’s family and friends during this
  incredibly difficult time. “Following Victoria’s tragic death, we completed a
  review and have made changes to improve our services. We will respond to the
  coroner’s report and take action to continue to improve and provide
  high-quality care to the people in our communities.” • In the UK and Ireland,
