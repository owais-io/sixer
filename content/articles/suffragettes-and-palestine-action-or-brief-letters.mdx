  Mark Nixon misunderstands my view of the suffragettes and other protest
  movements (Letters, 19 August). In my speech when I voted against the
  proscription of Palestine Action, I argued that the suffragettes would have
  been proscribed precisely because some had undertaken damage to property far
  greater than that said to have been committed by Palestine Action supporters.
  Peter Hain Labour, House of Lords • Never mind 35mm film canisters (Letters,
  17 August). Does anyone have a good use for spectacle cases? The opticians who
  repurpose unused glasses don’t accept them, so spectacle wearers collect quite
  a few over the years. They’re strong, open easily but shut securely, and seem
  far too good to throw away. Aileen Taylor Trowbridge, Wiltshire • My solution
  to the problem of storing copies of Feast magazine (Letters, 15 August): I cut
  out the recipes that I think I’ll actually cook and stick them in a large
  scrapbook. I later add notes on how I may have modified the recipe. The
  remaining magazines are then recycled. Rhona Bywater Silkstone Common, South
  Yorkshire • Nicola Slawson was ill advised to give the location (Shrewsbury)
  of the allotment she has given up (The one change that worked, 18 August). No
  doubt Angela Rayner has already given permission for it to become a housing
  estate. Tony Coghan London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
