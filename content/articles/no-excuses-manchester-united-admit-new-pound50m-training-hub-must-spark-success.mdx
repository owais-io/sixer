  Diogo Dalot says there will be “no excuses” if Manchester United do not
  succeed after the opening of a new £50m training facility. The minority owner
  Sir Jim Ratcliffe cut the ribbon on the building for the men’s team at
  Carrington after Sir Alex Ferguson unveiled a plaque to the long-serving club
  receptionist Kath Phipps, who died last year. Ratcliffe said the renovations
  were befitting of a club with ambitions to be one of the best in Europe, as he
  continues his plan to return United to previous heights. Dalot said: “The big
  thing that I like the most is now there’s going to be no excuses. Ultimately,
  the thing that will define us is what we do on the pitch. I think what is
  going to bring joy to the fans, joy to ourselves is winning games. We’re
  getting all the conditions to put us in the best position to win. And then we
  just have to make that final step.” The full squad attended the ceremony
  alongside the coaching staff, the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and the
  director of football, Jason Wilcox. The former chief executive David Gill and
  former captain Bryan Robson, a club ambassador, were among the dignitaries to
  attend. “We are delighted with the outcome and are confident the new facility
  will play an important role in building a winning culture at the club,”
  Ratcliffe said. United moved to Carrington from The Cliff at the turn of the
  century and had consistently adapted the site but created a disjointed layout.
  The comprehensive renovation, designed by Foster + Partners, aims to correct
  that. There is an emphasis on the flow of a player’s journey through the
  building, natural light plays a key role in what was previously a dark
  interior and additional communal spaces have been created to help players
  socialise. “Equipment and technology have been upgraded throughout, with a
  focus on fitness, nutrition, recovery and team unity,” United said. After
  Cristiano Ronaldo returned to United in 2021 he lamented the lack of change at
  Carrington in the 12 years since he had left, saying it “stopped in time”. It
  was accepted within the club that the training ground had fallen behind those
  of Premier League rivals and Ratcliffe identified it as an area to improve. It
  was prioritised as part of his £237.6m investment in infrastructure. There is
  a barber’s shop on site, which the goalkeeper Tom Heaton suggested would be
  most frequently visited by Dalot, a Formula One simulation room and a padel
  court, a construction the players insisted on. It is anticipated players will
  spend longer at the training ground than in previous years and it is designed
  to be more accommodating of the modern footballer’s requirements. An expanded
  first-team changing room and improved canteen have been installed. Sleep pods
  and dry floating tanks for relaxation are due to follow. Medical and
  rehabilitation facilities have been revamped with a view to matching the elite
  amenities at other sporting organisations. A basement was dug to allow for
  recovery pools and there is a new altitude training room. The men’s team going
  in will allow the women’s side to return to their facilities. They were moved
  out into temporary structures while the building work took place over the past
  12 months, so the men could have the best of what was available. “We’ve all
  been blown away by the opportunity this is going to provide in terms of a
  world-class facility,” said Heaton, who first trained at the site in the early
  2000s in the academy. “Of course people make a building, players on the pitch
  bring performances and bring results, but in terms of what that [the new
  facilities] can give you, in terms of providing help and stability for that
  performance, I think everyone’s excited.”
