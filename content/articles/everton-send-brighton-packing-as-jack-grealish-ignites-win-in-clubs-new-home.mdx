  Hill Dickinson Stadium, Everton’s season and Jack Grealish’s mission to
  reignite his career are up and running. The on-loan Manchester City winger
  sparkled on his home debut for David Moyes’s team as Brighton were punished
  for their profligacy. Everton and Grealish looked at home in their sleek new
  surroundings. On a sun-kissed, historic afternoon for a football club and a
  city, Everton delivered a win worthy of christening the £800m arena. Grealish
  illuminated the performance with two assists, for Iliman Ndiaye and James
  Garner, and departed to a standing ovation when substituted in the 94th
  minute. Evertonians have been craving a hero, their new stadium needs a star,
  and the 29‑year‑old is desperate to regain his England place in a World Cup
  year. The early evidence indicates a good fit all round. Fabian Hürzeler’s
  visitors had enough clear-cut chances to have ruined Everton’s big day,
  including from the penalty spot, but were unconvincing when it mattered – at
  both ends of the pitch, according to the Brighton manager. Jordan Pickford
  saved Danny Welbeck’s spot-kick to ensure there would be no first-day nerves
  among those in royal blue. “Jordan probably changed the outcome of the game,”
  Moyes said. “He drives me mad at times kicking it all over the place but
  keepers are there to use their hands and he made huge saves today.” The
  architect responsible for the finest development along the Liverpool
  waterfront in decades, Dan Meis, flew in from Los Angeles to witness the
  culmination of what he called “a long and emotional journey”. Evertonians made
  clear their appreciation for Meis’s vision when he was introduced before
  kick-off. The volume went up several notches when Grealish’s name was
  announced in an Everton starting lineup for the first time. Grealish would
  prove the architect of the first Premier League goal and win at Hill Dickinson
  Stadium. Moyes’s side started brightly, as the occasion demanded, but it
  wasn’t long before Grealish was gesturing to his new defensive colleagues to
  refrain from pumping hopeful long balls out from the back. Brighton’s more
  patient, accurate football took hold, and they could easily have been two
  goals ahead before falling behind. Kaoru Mitoma volleyed against the crossbar
  after James Tarkowski had misjudged the flight of Bart Verbruggen’s clearance
  from the Brighton area. Seconds later Yankuba Minteh muscled Idrissa Gueye off
  the ball near the byline and picked out Welbeck in the six-yard box. Welbeck,
  unmarked but off balance, scooped a glorious opportunity over. Everton soon
  capitalised. In a flowing move from right to left, one summer signing, the
  industrious Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, invited another, Grealish, to attack
  Brighton’s exposed right‑back Mats Wieffer. The winger obliged in style and
  pinged a cross to the far post for Ndiaye to volley home at close range. It
  was another place in the Everton history books for Ndiaye; the first league
  goal at Hill Dickinson Stadium a neat bookend to him having scored the final
  league goal at Goodison Park. The hosts were reprieved twice more before the
  interval. Brighton struck the woodwork for a second time when Jan Paul van
  Hecke’s drive deflected off Grealish and rebounded off a post with Pickford
  beaten. In first‑half stoppage time Tarkowski, who conceded the late penalty
  that culminated in Everton’s defeat at Leeds on Monday, played in Matt O’Riley
  with a dreadful backpass. O’Riley attempted to round Pickford but the England
  international saved at his feet. Tarkowski was a fortunate and extremely
  grateful man. Moyes started without a recognised full-back for the second game
  in succession. Brighton telegraphed their plan to target Garner at left‑back
  from the first whistle but the midfielder not only responded well defensively,
  he also doubled the hosts’ advantage superbly. Grealish again provided the
  assist. Brighton appealed for offside against Thierno Barry when Everton broke
  but play continued with Gueye finding Grealish. The England international,
  whose last assist for City came in September 2024, teed up Garner to shoot
  from 25 yards. His low effort flew through Minteh’s legs and inside
  Verbruggen’s near post. Hill Dickinson Stadium ignited. Everton protected
  their lead in relative comfort until conceding another penalty to handball
  with 15 minutes remaining. This time Dewsbury-Hall was penalised for handling
  Minteh’s shot. Pickford read Welbeck’s unconvincing spot-kick perfectly to
  save the eighth Premier League penalty of his career. Hürzeler, who lost
  Georginio Rutter with a minor training ground injury on Saturday, said: “We
  created enough chances, big big chances, to have won this game but the result
  doesn’t lie. In these moments where you have to score and you have to defend
  your own goal, we have to do better.” Grealish should have had a hat‑trick of
  assists but, having laid one on a plate for Dwight McNeil, the substitute
  scuffed his shot in front of Verbruggen’s goal. Not that Everton were
  complaining. The curtain opened perfectly on Hill Dickinson Stadium.
