  Many schemes to stop small boat crossings in the Channel have been considered
  by UK governments in recent years, from the Rwanda policy to “wave-machines”.
  Here are four of them. Rwanda In April 2022 the Conservative government set
  out plans to send tens of thousands of asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their
  claims processed, with costs including an initial payment of £120m. The first
  flight in June, which is believed to have had seven people onboard, was
  cancelled minutes before takeoff, after the European court of human rights in
  Strasbourg issued last-minute injunctions to stop it. In November 2023, the
  supreme court ruled the Rwanda policy was unlawful because there had not been
  a proper assessment of whether the country was safe. Britain and Rwanda signed
  a new treaty on asylum and the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act
  2024 subsequently declared Rwanda a safe country. One of the first acts of the
  Labour government was to scrap the scheme. Only four volunteering migrants had
  gone to Rwanda. Yvettte Cooper, the home secretary, told MPs in July last year
  the scheme had cost £700m. The south Atlantic Plans to send people who arrived
  on small boats to Ascension Island in the south Atlantic were re-examined in
  2023, in case the Rwanda policy failed. The idea was first mooted in 2020, but
  dropped because “it was just thought to be impossibly expensive to do”,
  according to Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was a cabinet minister when the idea was
  first considered. “Unfortunately it would cost at least £1m per person you
  sent there,” he told Times Radio. The 2020 plan was described as “implausible”
  by a Home Office source. Asked why it was being considered again in 2023, the
  Home Office minister Sarah Dines told Sky News: “Well, times change … This
  crisis in the Channel is urgent, we need to look at all possibilities and that
  is what we are doing.” Blockade The then home secretary, Sajid Javid, promised
  to provide two extra Border Force cutters, bringing the total to five, to
  patrol the Channel in 2019. The following year, Priti Patel said she intended
  to use the navy to block boats before they entered British waters. One defence
  official described the idea as “completely potty” and the French government,
  whose consent would be needed, had already said it would be illegal. The Home
  Office also set out plans to buy two jet skis to help with patrols, the Times
  reported. Trials took place in 2020 to test a blockade similar to Australia’s
  controversial “turn back the boats” tactic, according to official documents
  seen by the Guardian at the time. The document read: “Trials are currently
  under way to test a ‘blockade’ tactic in the Channel on the median line
  between French and UK waters, akin to the Australian ‘turn back’ tactic,
  whereby migrant boats would be physically prevented (most likely by one or
  more UK RHIBs [rigid hull inflatable boats]) from entering UK waters.” Wave
  machines and floating walls Among “blue-sky” ideas Home Office officials
  reportedly considered, and dismissed, in 2020 was the creation of “wave
  machines” in the Channel. Boats with pumps would create waves that would force
  the small boats back into French waters, a source told the Financial Times.
  But the proposal risked tipping migrants out of packed, often unseaworthy
  dinghies and boats into one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes
  in the world. The UK government also launched a consultation with the maritime
  industry to explore the construction of floating walls in the Channel,
  according to the Financial Times. An email from the trade body Maritime UK,
  obtained by the FT, revealed that the idea of floating barriers was being
  seriously pursued by Home Office officials. Maritime UK said at the time it
  had informed the Home Office that it did not think the proposal was “legally
  possible”. Downing Street said it did not recognise some of the more
  outlandish reporting – including the possibility of a wave machine. “These
  things won’t be happening,” a spokesperson told the Guardian at the time. The
  Home Office concluded “marine fencing” would not work.
