  In 1982 Eric Midwinter, who has died aged 93, co-founded the University of the
  Third Age (now u3a), with the social entrepreneur Michael Young and the
  historian Peter Laslett. Self-funding, it brings together those who are no
  longer working full-time or raising a family (there is no lower age limit) to
  continue the enjoyment of learning in a wide range of topics, chosen by
  members. This has the consequent benefit of challenging negative stereotypes
  of older people. Everyone works collaboratively to teach and learn from each
  other. The UK now has more than 1,000 u3a branches, each a self-governing
  charity affiliated to the Third Age Trust, with a total of 400,000 members.
  The model has been copied throughout the English-speaking world, as well as in
  eastern Europe and Australasia. Eric’s versatility became apparent during his
  two years (1966-68) as vice principal of Ethel Wormald College, Liverpool, a
  day college for mature students. He embarked on writing for radio and a
  13-part TV series on Welsh history. In 1968 he was appointed director of the
  Liverpool Education Priority Area, a precursor of Sure Start 30 years later.
  The aim was to tackle the educational problems in deprived areas, with
  action-research to raise standards; strengthen home and school links; and
  involve local people. In 1972 Penguin published Eric’s fifth book, Priority
  Education, and TV, radio and lecturing work followed. After a year as warden
  (later principal) of Walton teacher training college, the largest in Britain,
  he moved away from education when, in 1975, Young offered him the post of head
  of public affairs at his own creation, the new National Consumer Council. When
  the directorship fell vacant, Eric was overlooked for the top job, and he left
  in 1980. But during that time he had chaired both the Advisory Centre for
  Education, and the London Transport Users’ Consultative Committee, as well as
  publishing another four books, including a biography of the great 19th-century
  cricketer WG Grace. In his time as director of the National Corporation for
  the Care of Old People (1980-91), he transformed the organisation, soon
  changing its name to the Centre for Policy on Ageing; it was wound up last
  year. He saw “the old person as a positive, active citizen, not as a negative,
  passive social casualty”. Eric developed the organisation as an influential
  thinktank and switched it from grant-giving to policy analysis, with an
  extensive library. Seminars were organised and the journal Ageing &amp;
  Society launched. Its own publishing imprint produced dozens of well-produced
  publications, some written by Eric, on matters as diverse as pensions and the
  media; crime and the arts. In 1984 came CPA’s influential Home Life report,
  concerning residential care homes. He was a frequent conference speaker and a
  broadcaster. No matter how serious the topic, his speeches were always
  enlivened by an appropriate joke or a relevant anecdote. He combined vision
  and inspiration, with humility, an ability to listen, and an infectious sense
  of humour. Born in Sale, now part of Greater Manchester, Eric was the younger
  son of Edna (nee Ashworth) and Harold (Ack), a fireman. They lived with Eric’s
  paternal grandparents. He was raised by Ada, his grandmother, a low-church
  Anglican, in a faith he gave up for agnosticism when he was 16. At 13, the
  election of the Attlee government made him a lifelong socialist. From Sale
  grammar school he gained an exhibition to Cambridge to study history. But in
  1950, before taking up his place, he undertook national service and joined the
  Royal Education Corps. Promoted to sergeant, he was posted to Germany. At St
  Catharine’s College he played cricket, football, debated, and was an actor,
  writer and producer in the dramatic society, and was active in the Labour
  club. He graduated with a first. After a detour via Manchester’s treasurer’s
  department, Eric was soon teaching history, games and English at Manchester
  Central grammar school. He then moved to the new Oldwood school, Wythenshawe,
  and gained teaching qualifications. In 1955 he started lecturing on
  international affairs for the Workers’ Educational Association, from 1959
  lectured in liberal studies at Manchester Regional College of Art, and from
  1961 taught history at Edge Hill teacher training college, Ormskirk. In 1964
  he went to help establish Northumberland College, Newcastle, where he became
  principal lecturer and head of history. While there he completed a DPhil at
  York University. In retirement Eric was president of the Association of
  Cricket Statisticians and Historians, and continued his membership of the
  Savage Club and MCC in London, Lancashire CC, and enthusiasm for brass bands,
  Gilbert and Sullivan, football and reading. His eventual tally of more than 60
  books went on to include more on cricket and comedy, a guide to the popular
  classic novel, an analysis of the Attlee government, and a biography of Lord
  Salisbury. In 1992 he was appointed OBE. He married Margaret Eley in 1964. She
  survives him, along with their children, Matthew, Daniel and Kate, and
  grandchildren, Niamh, Patrick and Sam. • Eric Clare Midwinter, public servant
  and writer, born 11 February 1933; died 8 August 2025
