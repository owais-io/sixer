  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 8th (NB: this is not necessarily Ed
  Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 8th Prospects Although Brighton missed out on qualifying for Europe
  again, there was a sense of optimism rather than disappointment at the end of
  Fabian Hürzeler’s first season at the helm. Had it not been for a costly loss
  of form in the spring that brought one point from four league games and a
  defeat by Nottingham Forest on penalties in the last eight of the FA Cup, the
  German head coach might even have matched his predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi’s
  achievement of finishing sixth. After a raft of injuries to key players all
  season and with several signings from a summer spending spree of almost £200m
  struggling to settle, it was to Hürzeler’s credit that his team ended only one
  point short of Brighton’s record points tally from 2023 after three wins to
  round off the campaign. Now, in the words of chair Tony Bloom, with the
  youngest permanent Premier League manager having gained a year’s experience,
  “we are hoping for more next season”. Brighton scored 66 goals – the joint
  fifth-highest in the division – so much will depend on strengthening a defence
  that conceded 59, with the emphasis this summer on finding a long-term
  replacement for the veteran captain Lewis Dunk as he enters the last year of
  his contract. Diego Coppola, an Italy Under-21 centre-back, and Olivier
  Boscagli, who arrived on a free transfer from PSV, will be joined by the
  exciting Belgium left-back Maxim De Cuyper as Hürzeler hopes to build a more
  settled unit. The departure of João Pedro, who became the latest Brighton
  player to join Chelsea, has been offset by the signing of the highly regarded
  18-year-old striker Charalampos Kostoulas. His fellow Greece Under-21
  international Stefanos Tzimas and Sunderland’s playoff hero Tommy Watson will
  provide more attacking options for a squad that still includes the outstanding
  Kaoru Mitoma despite speculation he could depart and looks equipped to
  maintain a sustained push for Europe. The manager Hürzeler is guaranteed to
  wear his heart on his sleeve and has proved a hit with Brighton’s supporters
  after the popular De Zerbi’s departure. In an interview with British GQ in
  April, the 32-year-old revealed that he loves watches and Coldplay but never
  sits down in front of the television because there “are so many better things
  to do”. “I’m a big believer that the limit for our body is really high, and I
  think we don’t always try to push our limits,” he said. Brighton’s players
  should be well prepared for the start of the season in that case. Off-field
  picture After a record-breaking 2022-23 that yielded profits of £112m,
  Brighton announced a £73.3m profit in March – largely a result of receiving
  another large chunk from the British record sale of Moisés Caicedo to Chelsea.
  João Pedro’s departure for £60m will help to balance the books after last
  summer’s massive outlay made them the biggest net spenders in Europe. Bloom,
  who bought 29% of the Scottish club Hearts in June, is estimated to have
  invested more than £400m at his home-town club since becoming chair in 2009.
  In April, the long-serving chief executive, Paul Barber, committed his future
  until 2030. Star signing Much is expected of Kostoulas after Brighton saw off
  interest from several other clubs, including Chelsea, to snap him up for an
  initial fee of almost £30m that could rise by £2m to make him the most
  expensive Greek player in history. Represented by the same agent who took
  Giannis Antetokounmpo to the NBA, he became the youngest player to make a
  professional appearance for Olympiakos when he represented their B team at 15
  years and seven months, before he was part of the side that won the
  prestigious Uefa Youth League last year. Kostoulas will learn plenty from the
  evergreen Danny Welbeck, who finished as last season’s joint top scorer and
  turns 35 in November. Stepping up Bart Verbruggen, having strangely alternated
  with Jason Steele under De Zerbi, was preferred between the sticks by Hürzeler
  last season but the Dutchman made several costly errors. Nonetheless, a recent
  survey by the Swiss research group CIES Football Observatory identified the
  22-year-old as potentially the world’s most valuable goalkeeper with a
  projected fee of £54m. Verbruggen, who joined Brighton in 2023 from Anderlecht
  for £16m, will need to show more consistency to retain Hürzeler’s faith,
  although the England Under-21 goalkeeper James Beadle was allowed to join
  Birmingham on loan rather than provide more competition for the Netherlands
  international.
