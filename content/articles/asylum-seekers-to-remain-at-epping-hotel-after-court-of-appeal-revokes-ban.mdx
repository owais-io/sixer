  More than 130 people seeking asylum will be allowed to remain in the Bell
  hotel in Epping after the court of appeal overturned a high court ban on
  housing them there, with police braced for further angry protests. While the
  decision was a technical victory for the Home Office, as other local councils
  could have brought legal challenges against the use of hotels, it has already
  been seized on by Labour’s political opponents. Both Reform and the
  Conservatives accused the government of putting the rights of irregular
  migrants above those of British people – even though the case concerned people
  seeking asylum – after it argued in favour of using the hotels to uphold their
  legal responsibility to protect asylum seekers. Three judges on Friday set
  aside a temporary injunction granted to Epping Forest district council last
  week, saying the decision to allow it was “seriously flawed” and contained
  several “errors in principle”. In recent weeks the hotel has become the focus
  of repeated protests, some of which have been orchestrated by far-right
  extremists and have turned violent. Epping council had said the protests were
  part of its grounds for seeking the injunction – alongside concerns about
  planning permission for the hotel. Last week, Mr Justice Eyre, sitting in the
  high court, agreed. But the court of appeal judges said upholding that order
  could lead to further disorder by effectively demonstrating that such action
  could achieve protesters’ ultimate goal – the removal of the asylum seekers
  one way or another. They said the people living at the Bell hotel would have
  to be housed somewhere, and other councils could regard preserving the
  injunction as a green light to do the same in their areas. Analysing the high
  court decision, Lord Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Davies and Lord
  Justice Cobb, said: “If an outbreak of protests enhances the case for a
  planning injunction, this runs the risk of acting as an impetus or incentive
  for further protests – some of which may be disorderly – around asylum
  accommodation. At its worst, if even unlawful protests are to be treated as
  relevant, there is a risk of encouraging further lawlessness. “The [high
  court] judge’s approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of
  one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system.” The
  judges added that “the potential cumulative impact” of other councils reacting
  by trying to gain injunctions in their own areas was a “material consideration
  … that was not considered by the judge”. The ruling will come as a relief to
  the site’s owner, Somani Hotels, and the Home Office, which both challenged
  the injunction, the latter amid concerns it would prompt a host of legal
  challenges from other councils. Speaking after the decision, the Home Office
  minister, Angela Eagle, said: “We inherited a chaotic asylum accommodation
  system costing billions. This government will close all hotels by the end of
  this parliament and we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell can be
  exited in a controlled and orderly way that avoids the chaos of recent years
  that saw 400 hotels open at a cost of £9m a day.” The Refugee Council’s chief
  executive, Enver Solomon, said using hotels to house asylum seekers was
  “untenable”, adding: “Waiting until 2029 to end their use is no longer an
  option. As long as hotels remain open, they will continue to be flashpoints
  for protests, fuelling division and leaving people who have fled war and
  persecution feeling unsafe.” The charity urged ministers to adopt its
  “one-off” scheme granting temporary permission to stay to those asylum seekers
  most likely to be recognised as refugees because of the situation in their
  home country. This would lead to the closure of hotels by next year, according
  to its own analysis. Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said: “Keir Starmer has
  shown that he puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of
  British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities.”
  Starmer was not a party to the case, which concerned people seeking asylum –
  not illegal immigrants. The Home Office’s lawyer suggested the legal duty of
  the home secretary, as a government minister representing the whole of the UK,
  to uphold human rights trumped those of a single council to follow planning
  law. The judges said this analysis was “unattractive”. Badenoch added that the
  ruling was a “setback, but it is not the end. I say to Conservative councils
  seeking similar injunctions against asylum hotels – keep going”. But a senior
  Tory source said: “They’re human beings; they have to live somewhere. For me
  the issue is: where’s the deterrent?” Some Tory MPs fear urging councils to
  mount further legal challenges could backfire, given the court’s warning that
  local protests cannot justify emergency injunctions. Another Tory MP said:
  “We’re throwing lawyers at this problem instead of showing how exactly we can
  fix the system.” The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, also criticised the
  decision, claiming the government had “used ECHR [European Convention on Human
  Rights] against the people of Epping”. Despite the ruling relating to legal
  asylum seekers, he added: “Illegal migrants have more rights than the British
  people under Starmer.” Home Office lawyers had argued that the government’s
  duties towards asylum seekers under the ECHR were “fundamentally different”
  from Epping Forest district council’s planning responsibilities. The council’s
  leader, Chris Whitbread, called for calm, telling Times Radio: “There’s been
  peaceful protests and there’s been non-peaceful protests outside the hotel.”
  The council could still be granted an injunction after the full hearing of the
  legal claim. “Obviously we’re still going to court in October to go for a
  final injunction and we will be pushing hard to make sure that’s successful,
  but we will do everything we can still,” Whitbread said. The judges said the
  original decision was “seriously flawed in principle” , pointing out that the
  “risk of injustice to the residents of the hotel by being dispersed by 12
  September when the trial of the claim was to take place only some six weeks
  later seems to have had oddly little resonance with the [high court] judge”.
  Neither the council nor the hotel’s owner had argued in the high court case
  that the fear of crime being committed in Epping in the future was a key
  factor, though both had agreed it was relevant. The court of appeal judges
  said this was correct, but that it was outweighed by the concern about
  incentivising more potentially violent protests, the upheaval of having to
  disperse more than 130 people for the short period before the trial, and other
  factors in the broader public interest. The judges granted both the Home
  Office and the hotel’s owners permission to appeal. They also agreed Mr
  Justice Eyre was wrong to refuse to allow the home secretary to intervene in
  the case, saying the Home Office had a “constitutional role relating to public
  safety” and was affected by the issues. The latest Home Office data shows
  there were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels at the end of June. This was up
  from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were
  still in power, but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March.
