  Donald Trump again called for the release of a former election clerk in
  Colorado who was convicted for her role in breaching election data in a quest
  to find fraud, threatening he would take “harsh measures” if she was not let
  out of prison. “FREE TINA PETERS, a brave and innocent Patriot who has been
  tortured by Crooked Colorado politicians, including the big Mail-In Ballot
  supporting the governor of the State,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Let Tina
  Peters out of jail, RIGHT NOW. She did nothing wrong, except catching the
  Democrats cheat in the Election. She is an old woman, and very sick. If she is
  not released, I am going to take harsh measures!!!” Peters did not find
  evidence of Democrats cheating in the election. She was charged for allowing
  access to county voting equipment by an outside election activist, who was
  given security credentials under a different name. Materials and passwords
  were then published online on Telegram and on the rightwing outlet the Gateway
  Pundit. She was found guilty by a jury in Mesa county in 2024 of seven counts
  related to misconduct, conspiracy and impersonation, four of which were felony
  charges. She was sentenced later that year to nine years in prison. Her
  attorneys had argued for probation instead of prison time. In her sentencing,
  Judge Matthew Barrett said Peters had no’t shown remorse for her actions. He
  said she was “as defiant as a defendant that the court has ever seen” and that
  he was “convinced you’d do it all over again if you could”. Peters’ release
  has become a rallying cry on the right, especially among election deniers.
  Voice messages from her have appeared on rightwing podcasts in which she
  continues to advance election conspiracies. Peters’ attorneys have filed an
  appeal of her conviction and are seeking to get her out on bond while the
  appeal plays out, arguing in a federal habeas corpus petition that her bond
  denial stems from her exercise of first amendment rights. Her lawyer told
  Colorado Newsline that she “has been made to stay in prison because people are
  afraid of what she would say”. Trump has previously called for Peters’
  release, in May saying in social media posts that she was an “innocent
  Political Prisoner” who was part of a “Communist persecution by the Radical
  Left Democrats to cover up their Election crimes and misdeeds in 2020”.
  Because Peters is convicted of state-level crimes, Trump cannot pardon her;
  the Colorado governor, Democrat Jared Polis, could. Trump’s justice department
  submitted a court filing in March saying it would be reviewing the case for
  potential “abuses of the criminal justice process”. Dan Rubinstein, the
  Republican district attorney in Mesa county who prosecuted the case, noted in
  a statement to the Guardian that the county is one of Colorado’s most
  conservative, with an all-Republican board of county commissioners who
  requested to prosecute Peters. “It is a gross mischaracterization of the facts
  of the case to claim Ms Peters did nothing wrong, after she cost the citizens
  of Mesa county, Colorado, more than a million dollars as a result of her
  criminal acts,” Rubinstein said. “Ms Peters was indicted by a grand jury of
  her peers, and convicted unanimously, with a standard of proof beyond a
  reasonable doubt, at a trial by a jury of her peers that she selected.”
