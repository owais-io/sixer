  Tulsi Gabbard, the director of US national intelligence, announced on Tuesday
  that the Trump administration has revoked the security clearances of 37
  current and former national security officials. In a memo posted to X, Gabbard
  accused the individuals of “politicizing and manipulating intelligence,
  leaking classified intelligence without authorization, and/or committing
  intentional egregious violations of tradecraft standards”. Gabbard said that
  the action was taken at the direction of Donald Trump. “Being entrusted with a
  security clearance is a privilege, not a right,” Gabbard wrote in the memo.
  “Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution
  and put their own interests ahead of the interests of the American people have
  broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.” The memo did not cite
  specific evidence of wrongdoing but included a list of the 37 individuals
  whose clearances were revoked. The list includes some officials who were
  involved in the 2017 intelligence assessment of Russia’s efforts to influence
  the 2016 election, according to CNN, citing a source familiar with the matter.
  It also reportedly includes former members of Joe Biden’s national security
  council. Some of the others on the list also signed a 2019 letter signaling
  their concerns about Trump. The letter was posted on social media last month
  by rightwing activist Laura Loomer. “As national security professionals, many
  of us have long been concerned with President Trump’s actions and their
  implications for our safety and security,” the beginning of the 2019 letter
  reads. Mark Zaid, a national security attorney whose own clearance was
  previously revoked by the Trump administration, called Gabbard’s announcement
  on Tuesday “pure politicization of security clearance process”. “These are
  unlawful decisions that deviate from decades of precedent,” Zaid said.
  “Completely unprofessional that individuals are targeted in way that impacts
  their careers, yet they are not notified before leaking memo to friendly
  media.” Zaid also said in another post that one person on the list “was
  supposed to already have his clearance revoked by Executive Order issued on
  Inauguration Day”, adding: “Guess someone goofed. Shocking.” Gabbard’s
  announcement on Tuesday is the latest action taken by the Trump administration
  targeting national security officials and critics of the president. In July,
  Gabbard accused Barack Obama and his national security team of committing
  “treasonous conspiracy”, alleging they led an effort to undermine Trump’s 2016
  presidential campaign and manufactured intelligence about Russian interference
  in the election. Later that month, the justice department announced the
  formation of a “strike force” to assess the evidence around Gabbard’s claims,
  and to “investigate potential next legal steps which might stem from DNI
  Gabbard’s disclosures”. Susan Miller, a former CIA official who helped lead
  intelligence assessments on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election,
  told the Guardian in late July that Gabbard’s allegations were based on false
  statements and misrepresentations. Democrats and other critics of the
  administration have accused the Trump administration of reviving the Russia
  investigation narrative in an effort to deflect attention from the scandal
  around the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The
  administration has faced growing bipartisan pressure to release records
  related to the Epstein case. Trump also revoked the security clearances of
  former president Biden, Kamala Harris, former secretary of state Antony
  Blinken, and several other critics, including Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, and
  New York attorney general Letitia James in March.
