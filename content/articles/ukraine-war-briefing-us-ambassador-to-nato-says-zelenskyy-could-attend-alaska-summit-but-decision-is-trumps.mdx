  The US ambassador to Nato said on Sunday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy could attend this week’s US-Russia summit in Alaska, as European
  leaders push for Kyiv to be part of the negotiations. Ambassador Matthew
  Whitaker was asked on CNN whether Zelenskyy might join US President Donald
  Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Friday. “Yes, I certainly
  think it’s possible,” he said. “Certainly, there can’t be a deal that
  everybody that’s involved in it doesn’t agree to. And, I mean, obviously, it’s
  a high priority to get this war to end.” Whitaker said the decision would
  ultimately be Trump’s to make. “If he thinks that that is the best scenario to
  invite Zelenskyy, then he will do that,” he said, adding that “no decision has
  been made to this point.” Germany warned the White House on Sunday against any
  deal hatched “over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians”. Chancellor
  Friedrich Merz said he hoped and assumed that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, would also be involved. “We cannot accept in any case that
  territorial questions are discussed or even decided between Russia and America
  over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he told the broadcaster ARD. “I
  assume that the American government sees it the same way.” US vice-president
  JD Vance, speaking a day after meeting the UK foreign minister, David Lammy,
  said he did not think it would be productive for the Russian president to meet
  his Ukrainian counterpart before speaking with Trump. “We’re at a point now
  where we’re trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things like that,
  around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this
  conflict,” he told Fox News. Zelenskyy thanked European allies for rallying
  around ahead of the Alaska summit after European leaders issued a coordinated
  statement on Saturday night that said the “path to peace” in Ukraine could not
  be decided without Kyiv. In a post on X he said: “The end of the war must be
  fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people.”
  EU foreign ministers will discuss the Alaska talks in a meeting by video link
  on Monday, joined by their Ukrainian counterpart. “The US has the power to
  force Russia to negotiate seriously. Any deal between the US and Russia must
  have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine’s and the
  whole of Europe’s security,” top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas said on Sunday. Three
  people were killed in Russia’s Tula and Nizhny Novgorod regions in overnight
  Ukrainian drone attacks that also targeted Moscow, Russian regional officials
  and the defence ministry said on Monday. Two people died and two were
  hospitalised after an attack before midnight on Sunday on the Tula region that
  borders the Moscow region to its north, Tula governor Dmitry Milyaev said on
  Telegram. One person was killed and two hospitalised after a Ukrainian attack
  on an industrial zone in the Nizhny Novgorod region in western Russia,
  regional governor Gleb Nikitin said. Russian air defence units destroyed 59
  Ukrainian drones overnight, including 12 over the Tula region and two over the
  Moscow region, the ministry said. The reports could not be independently
  verified and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Russian shelling and
  drone attacks killed six people in Ukraine on Sunday, authorities said, while
  a Russian strike on a bus station in the city of Zaporizhzhia wounded at least
  19. The six people were killed across the eastern regions of Donetsk,
  Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, their respective authorities said. Kyiv said it had
  hit two oil refineries deep inside Russia, one in the western Saratov region
  and one in the remote northern town of Ukhta in the Komi Republic, AFP
  reported. The governor of Saratov, Roman Busargin, only gave a vague comment
  about it, saying that “one of the industrial enterprises was damaged” and
  adding that one person had died as a result of the drone attack. The Komi
  governor confirmed in his Telegram channel there had been a drone attack on
  the region, but didn’t mention the Ukhta refinery and said there were no
  casualties. Ukraine’s military said on Sunday it had taken back a village in
  the Sumy region from the Russian army, which has made significant recent
  gains. The village is on the frontline in the north of the country and about
  20 kilometres (13 miles) west of the main fighting between the two armies in
  the northern region.
