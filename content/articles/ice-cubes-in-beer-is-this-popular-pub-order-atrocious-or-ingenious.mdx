  Name: Icy beer. Age: Niche for a while, now horribly mainstream. Appearance:
  There’s no way to sugarcoat this, it’s beer with ice cubes in it. I see we’re
  talking about people with no taste today. If by people with no taste you mean
  28% of all 18-35-year-olds, then yes. To clarify: one in four adults under the
  age of 35 enjoy their beer with ice cubes in it? Slightly more than one in
  four, yes. But only when it’s warm outside. I have to say, this sounds like a
  lie. And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000
  people that was recently commissioned by LG. The television manufacturing
  brand? That doesn’t make it any less valid. What’s more, there’s a good chance
  that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is
  probably much higher. Why is that? Because another 10% said embarrassment was
  holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that
  they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for
  requesting it. Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad
  thing? Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so
  diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work
  went into crafting that flavour profile. Don’t just mess it all up because you
  like your glass to clink when you swirl it. Where did this horrible trend
  originate? France, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it
  on a hot day. Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people
  complaining about France’s innate hatred of iced drinks? Listen, things
  change. People put ice cubes in beer. It’s progress. This has to be the worst
  drinks trend of the year. Clearly someone hasn’t seen Materialists yet. Oh
  God, why? Because that’s the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that’s
  half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany. What is happening
  to the world? Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that’s beer
  and lemonade. What’s so bad about using a different fizzy drink? I suppose
  that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer. Don’t worry, this
  isn’t actually going to be the future. Why’s that? Because younger generations
  typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with
  the World Health Organization’s goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per
  capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of
  disappearing. Oh fine, I’ll turn a blind eye this time. That’s more like it.
  Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please. Do say: “I put ice cubes in
  my beer to stay cool.” Don’t say: “I prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine
  to make it more filling.” • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in
