  At about the age of 14, Lily* started to feel tired a lot of the time. She
  would regularly oversleep and lacked the energy to do basic things. It was
  also the time she started menstruating and having heavy periods. At 25, Lily
  was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and prescribed antidepressants for
  her symptoms. While they helped her, she also had to put up with the
  side-effects of memory loss, low sex drive and weight gain. A decade later,
  she went to a GP who asked her more questions than any of the previous doctors
  and ordered a blood test. They revealed that her iron levels were the lowest
  they had ever been, bordering on anaemia. The doctor recommended an iron
  infusion. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The week after, I just felt so
  wildly different,” she says. After decades of experiencing symptoms of
  tiredness and feeling overwhelmed, “you start to identify with that, as just
  who you are”. Lily is among one in five Australian women who have an iron
  disorder, and many, like her, live for years with debilitating, untreated
  symptoms. The scale of iron disorder misdiagnoses is not well understood and
  there is a lack of research in the area. One study of more than 1,000 Swiss
  women with iron disorders found 35% were initially misdiagnosed and treated
  for the wrong condition, most commonly depression. Dr Nicole Jenkins, a
  scientist at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, says such
  misdiagnoses are not surprising considering symptoms like feeling down or
  finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning are common between iron and
  mood disorders. Iron is necessary for the production of dopamine, which is
  often called the “feelgood chemical”, so if iron levels are low, dopamine
  production tends to be low too. “Depression and iron deficiency can often
  occur at the same time,” says Jenkins, who is working on a new type of test to
  better detect iron disorders. “But if you’re getting treatment for depression
  and you’re not getting treatment for your iron deficiency, then the treatment
  for depression may not be as effective.” Jenkins knows first-hand how hard it
  is to be diagnosed with an iron disorder. Seven years after she developed
  symptoms of extreme tiredness she was finally diagnosed correctly and treated.
  Having spent her career researching iron balance in ageing, Jenkins felt “a
  bit silly” that she hadn’t realised low iron was to blame for her own
  symptoms, which included feeling tired all the time and, eventually, an
  irregular heartbeat. But for many years, her blood test results had been
  normal. As she looked into the issue, she discovered why. Jenkins also had
  endometriosis, which not only caused the heavy periods leading to low iron,
  but was also the reason blood tests did not pick up her iron deficiency until
  her levels were dangerously low. Some chronic health conditions, including
  endometriosis, can distort the results of tests for iron levels. Measuring the
  bottles, not the water At the moment, the most accurate method for testing
  iron deficiency is to measure the protein that stores the iron, known as
  ferritin. Jenkins says we can imagine our iron is like water inside tiny
  bottles. “The current test will tell us how many water bottles we have,” she
  says, “but they don’t tell you how much water is in them.” The problem is that
  while some “bottles” are full of “water”, others are empty, she says. Another
  issue is that at times of inflammation – which can be caused by an illness
  such as a common cold, as well as chronic health conditions – ferritin levels
  will go up independently of their iron levels. This means ferritin-based iron
  tests can be inaccurate, particularly in people with chronic health
  conditions, and result in misdiagnosis, as well as delayed diagnosis. Not just
  an issue of diagnosis Lily’s problem did not lie in her diagnosis, as blood
  tests did pick up her low iron levels. But her body did not readily absorb the
  iron tablets she was recommended. They did not make a difference to her energy
  levels and gave her bad side-effects, including cramps. She stopped taking
  antidepressants after her iron infusion but her GP prescribed her the birth
  control pill to manage her heavy periods – and her anxiety spiked again.
  “Everything is so intertwined, it can be really hard to make sense of what is
  low iron, what’s anxiety, what’s depression, what’s hormonal,” Lily says. A
  new test Jenkins is the chief executive and cofounder of FeBI Technologies, a
  spin-out company of the Florey Institute and the University of Melbourne,
  which is developing a world-first blood test that could measure iron itself –
  not ferritin. She says the new test could not only help the issues of
  misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of iron disorders, but could also help the
  management of iron disorders, as doctors could better understand how patients
  are responding to iron tablets or infusions. The test uses quantum sensors
  based on nanodiamonds – tiny diamonds used in car polish which are not
  expensive but contain properties that react to a magnetic signal. The iron
  within ferritin has a magnetic signal, so these sensors react when they’re in
  the presence of iron, Jenkins says. “We’re measuring how much these sensors
  change and that tells us how much iron is in the ferritin.” The federal
  government’s critical technologies challenge program has provided almost half
  a million dollars to fund prototype development at Sunrise Health Service
  Aboriginal Corporation in Katherine, in the Northern Territory. The six-month
  trial beginning in August will involve speaking to communities about how the
  test can be made accessible, affordable and able to operate in any
  environment. Jenkins hopes the test will be widely available to help people by
  2028. Prof Derek Abbott, an expert in quantum systems at the University of
  Adelaide, who was not involved in the project, says using the quantum sensors
  based on the nanodiamonds to detect iron in blood is “entirely feasible”.
  “Iron deficiency is indeed a significant global problem,” Abbott says. “To be
  able to do an accurate on-the-spot measurement would be a godsend.” *Name has
