  Glenn Moore: Please Sir, Glenn I Have Some Moore? review – a tale of two
  jokebooks
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  Glenn Moore has a device he’s deploying in his new show, to maintain a balance
  between hilarity and underwhelm. He has two notebooks, one placed on each side
  of the stage. If a joke goes badly, he’ll go to the book containing his best
  ever material, and win the audience round with one of those classic gags. And
  if tonight’s crowd starts loving his show too much, he’ll read from the other
  book, containing material he’s ashamed of. Slim chance, you might think, of
  Moore’s audience not finding him funny: this is one of the best joke writers
  in the business. And Please Sir, Glenn I Have Some Moore? is another
  compendium of crackers from the 36-year-old. They are strung around the
  episodic tale of a drive through Death Valley he took, years ago, with his two
  cousins. They take a wrong turn, get lost, and acrimony ensues, in a story
  designed to demonstrate our host’s low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness.
  All of which is fine, as far as it goes. But Moore is not a comedian gifted
  with conviviality, nor at making us believe a word he says. The material may
  be self-deprecating, but the delivery remains officious. It’s made repeatedly
  clear that Moore prioritises the gag over the building of a good-faith rapport
  with his audience – and consequently the Death Valley story, and indeed the
  two-books device, are hard to take at face value. (Moore’s decisions to read
  from one or the other book, supposedly based on audience reaction, feel
  entirely arbitrary.) Does any of that matter? We come to comedy shows to
  laugh, and Moore doesn’t stint on that front. Puns, visual puns, idioms
  upended, arresting observations – the Croydon man is a grandmaster of them
  all, from his gag hating on the French language (“Every day they change the
  meaning of soup du jour”) to his belter on Mick Jagger’s erotic credo. Maybe
  he doesn’t have the onstage demeanour to sell them as genially as he might,
  but the quality, quantity and variety of the jokes here can’t be taken for
  granted. • At Soho theatre, London, 8-13 September, then touring • All our
