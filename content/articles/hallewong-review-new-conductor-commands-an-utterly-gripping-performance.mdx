webTitle: Hallé/Wong review – new conductor commands an utterly gripping performance

  Despite its unofficial subtitle, Mahler never settled on a definitive
  narrative for his Second Symphony. But although he scrapped his own
  programmatic explanations, the sense of epic trajectory has clung on. Like
  Beethoven’s Ninth, the symphony’s finale features a chorus and soloists as
  well as vast orchestral forces in a shattering, cosmic-scale climax. No
  surprise, then, that the ending of the Hallé’s first Proms appearance with
  their new principal conductor, Kahchun Wong, was utterly gripping: the
  breathtakingly elemental chords of its opening; offstage horns slicing
  laser-like through the air; climaxes snatched away to leave tiny, muttering
  details; the nightmarish outbreak of brass and percussion from the gallery.
  Conducting without a score, Wong maintained ultraprecise coordination across
  the cavernous Royal Albert Hall. A full hour into the performance, the
  nose-to-tail Prommers stood as if transfixed, even before the Hallé Choir and
  Hallé Youth Choir entered with their first unaccompanied passage – minutely
  blended and astonishingly quiet. In the symphony’s final minutes, with an
  organ pedal that vibrated through the floor, catastrophically powerful lower
  brass and bells pealing from the gallery, Wong ditched his baton and
  manoeuvred his supersized forces with tremendous, muscular arm sweeps, as if
  single-handedly hauling an ocean liner into dock. Many sprang to their feet
  with the final chord still ringing. What made that finale so powerful,
  however, was Wong’s commitment to the long game. A big baton-flick upwards at
  the start launched energetic scrubbing from the upper strings – but Mahler’s
  strange, frantic motif for the cellos and basses was earthy rather than
  ferocious and Wong returned to a baseline of pianissimo, gossamer tone
  (polished rather than characterful) at every opportunity. The second movement
  was a strictly genteel, sugar-coated account of Mahler’s Ländler. Only in the
  third did something more vivid begin to take hold: sinewy woodwind solos,
  snarling stopped horns, the big, slow bloom of two gongs. The subsequent
  orchestral song featuring Emily D’Angelo’s creamy mezzo felt oddly
  underpowered, as if Wong was pulling back still further with the finale in
  mind. But the refinement of Wong’s approach also persisted, beguilingly, into
  the fifth, providing lightness and limpidity for each of Mahler’s deep
  shadows. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue
  until 13 September
