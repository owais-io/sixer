  The Old Firm derby on Sunday will have Europa League teams. If Celtic have
  deep regrets over misfires in Kazakhstan, Rangers endured a night of
  near-historic shame in Belgium, utterly incapable of recovering from the
  first‑leg performance. By contrast to this horror show, that night of blunder
  was a creditable showing. Russell Martin’s team made it so simple for an
  admittedly high-class Brugge side. On Martin the jury is out, his winless
  start to the domestic season followed by this nightmare. The former
  Southampton manager’s stewardship is in grave danger after 10 games in charge.
  The response of the club’s new 49ers ownership, for whom Martin was the first
  managerial appointment, is keenly awaited. The depths to which Rangers
  plunged, particularly in the first half, made a mockery of his continued
  self-belief, his proclamations that his is the only way forward. Martin’s team
  selection was, he said, custom-designed to reduce the two‑goal deficit from
  Ibrox. Leaving Nico Raskin, James Tavernier and Cyriel Dessers on the bench
  was a decision open to a different interpretation. Hamza Igamane was absent,
  presumably headed for Lille. Brugge attempted to finish the tie as soon as
  possible. It proved all too easy. Carlos Forbs’s run and Jayden Meghoma’s
  early bookable offence was an early warning sign unheeded. In the fifth
  minute, Nicolò Tresoldi nodded in after a statuesque Rangers defence allowed
  an overlapping Joaquin Seys to cross from the left. To compound early disaster
  came high farce when Max Aarons found himself out of position. His solution?
  To haul back Christos Tzolis, Brugge’s dangerman, for an indisputable straight
  red. Martin sent on Tavernier, attempting to stop the bloodletting with the
  patient already long dead. Brugge ruthlessly turned the screw, Tzolis striking
  the woodwork via Jack Butland’s fingertips. The Rangers goalkeeper was left
  unprotected as Hans Vanaken, the veteran, nodded in Tzolis’s header, then
  struck the woodwork with a volley as the onslaught continued. Seys made it
  three on another overlap, then scored a fourth, unmarked at the back post.
  Aleksandar Stankovic’s header made it five, the defensive no-show continuing.
  For all the dreadfulness of Rangers, Brugge showed off much to augment the
  growing reputation of Belgian club football with the quality of their
  attacking, echoing their decent showing in last season’s group stage and
  knockouts. Martin made three half-time changes, including Raskin’s
  introduction. “Everyone needs to be ready,” he had said pre-match. The
  starting team had included eight summer signings made under the new manager.
  Those second‑half arrivals would have to share in the shame. Tzolis,
  understandably coveted across Europe, soon scored the sixth, seizing on
  Tresoldi’s showboat backheel. Just as in the first half, Rangers were a goal
  down after five minutes of the second. Historic disgrace approached. The
  club‑record European defeats, 6-0 against Real Madrid in 1960, 7-1 by
  Liverpool in 2022, were in danger of being surpassed, Martin’s players
  appearing incapable of avoiding such ignominy or protecting their own
  reputations. Relief from being the worst of all nights lay only in Brugge
  stepping off the pace rather than any Rangers improvement.
