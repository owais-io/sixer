  Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has spoken of his pride at being
  named to Donald Trump’s council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Tagovailoa
  joins two other current NFL stars on the council, Nick Bosa and Harrison
  Butker, who have been backers of Trump’s Maga movement. While Tagovailoa has
  not publicly expressed his support for the president, who once described NFL
  players who knelt for the national anthem as “sons of bitches”, he said he was
  happy to align himself with Trump. “I think it’s pretty cool – it’s an honor,
  [to serve on the council]” Tagovailoa said on Wednesday. “I don’t know too
  much about it, but it’s an honor.” Trump has revitalized the council under an
  executive order that will also being back the presidential fitness test for
  American children, which was phased out during the Obama administration.
  Tagovailoa said he did not know why he had been named to the council. When
  Trump announced the council’s members he mispronounced Tagovailoa’s name. On
  Wednesday. the quarterback laughed off the president’s error. “I don’t think
  he’s had the worst – I heard a couple worse at Alabama,” said Tagovailoa. “It
  is what it is, I don’t take that to heart.” Earlier this week, Philadelphia
  Eagles running back Saquon Barkley said he had declined his invitation to sit
  on the council. “A couple months ago, it was brought to my team about the
  council,” Barkley told reporters after Monday’s Eagles practice session. “So
  I’m not really too familiar with it. I felt like that I am going to be super
  busy. Me and my family thought it would probably be of best interest to not
  accept that. I was definitely a little shocked when my name was mentioned. I’m
  assuming it’s something great, so I appreciate it but was a little shocked
  when my name was mentioned.” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will also be a
  member of the council.
