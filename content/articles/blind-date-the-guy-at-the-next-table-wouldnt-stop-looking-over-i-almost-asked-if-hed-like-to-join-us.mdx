  Taylor on Joshua What were you hoping for? Love at first sight. No, honestly,
  good conversation with a good person. Someone who was willing to engage with
  the spirit of the evening. First impressions? He had a quiet, calming
  presence. He arrived just before me and had already ordered a glass of
  sauvignon blanc, so I knew he was a man of taste. What did you talk about? His
  work as a professional musician and composer, which I found fascinating. We
  both have dual nationality, so we discussed the benefits of that. Most awkward
  moment? The guy at the next table wouldn’t stop looking at us. I almost asked
  him if he’d like to join us! Good table manners? Yes. His parents would be
  proud. Best thing about Joshua? His ability to be open and vulnerable with a
  total stranger. Would you introduce Joshua to your friends? Probably not – but
  maybe he’d get on with my musically inclined friends. Describe Joshua in three
  words Open, kind, shy. What do you think he made of you? He was quite hard to
  read, so I have no idea. He laughed at my jokes, though! Did you go on
  somewhere? Does the tube station count? And … did you kiss? A platonic goodbye
  hug was the closest we got to first base. If you could change one thing about
  the evening, what would it be? I’d like to have heard one of his compositions.
  It’s not every day you go on a date with a music maestro. Marks out of 10? 6.
  Would you meet again? I don’t think so. There was no romantic connection, but
  he’s a lovely person and I enjoyed our time together. Joshua on Taylor What
  were you hoping for? Honestly, just a decent conversation. A bit of spark
  wouldn’t go amiss either. First impressions? “Handsome” was the first word
  that popped into my head. Beyond that, he was immediately polite, genuinely
  warm and had a very friendly vibe. What did you talk about? Our US
  connections. Travel. Sport. Work. Family. Most awkward moment? Probably when a
  bloke at the next table decided to chime in. Bit of a buzzkill. Good table
  manners? He was very good, though I might have noticed an elbow or two
  creeping on to the table at one point. Minor quibble! Best thing about Taylor?
  He’s genuinely curious and asks great questions, which makes you feel heard.
  Would you introduce Taylor to your friends? Absolutely. He’s got a good energy
  and seems like someone my mates would easily get along with. Describe Taylor
  in three words Warm, outgoing, kind. What do you think he made of you? I think
  my passion for music probably stood out. Hopefully, in a good way. Did you go
  on somewhere? Just a walk to the tube. Kept it chill. And … did you kiss? No.
  If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Just that
  little interruption from the neighbouring table. Marks out of 10? A strong 8.
  Would you meet again? Yes, definitely. Joshua and Taylor ate at Sam’s
  Riverside, London W6. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com
