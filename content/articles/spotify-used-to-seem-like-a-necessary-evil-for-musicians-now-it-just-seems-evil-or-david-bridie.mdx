  Spotify used to seem like a necessary evil for musicians. Now it just seems

  Being an independent musician comes with plenty of challenges, but it also
  comes with privileges, and one of them is that you’re free to speak your mind.
  You can live by your beliefs. When necessary, you can kick against the pricks.
  Today, I am joining a growing number of musicians kicking against one prick in
  particular. I have decided to remove my music from Spotify. Don’t get me
  wrong. I appreciate the positive side of streaming. It’s convenient, like
  having your own radio station. If you’re in a car and you want to hear Beasley
  Street by John Cooper Clarke – which I often do – it’s there for you. This
  ease of access is a great thing for the listener. And it can be a good thing
  for the artist too, if, after hearing a song on a streaming platform, the
  listener then buys the album or pays to see the artist in concert. But it’s
  not so great if streaming is the listener’s only engagement. Because that
  accessibility means fewer people now buy music via digital download, vinyl or
  CD – which would be fine, if streaming royalty rates weren’t atrocious.
  Spotify pays artists between $0.003 and $0.005 per stream. For independent
  artists – especially those from the Pacific and First Nations communities, and
  artists without the machinery of major labels – this is insulting and
  completely unsustainable. A royalty model that is not sustainable for artists
  leads to a situation where only the independently wealthy can create music –
  an outcome that is neither culturally healthy nor desirable. Of course, that’s
  assuming the independently wealthy musicians are able to fight off the
  AI-generated music currently crowding on to the streaming platforms. Don’t
  think this situation has come about because times are hard for everybody. The
  music industry is making as much revenue as it did at its 1990s peak, but
  little of that money is making it through to those who play the instruments or
  sing the tunes. As musicians, we have been left with little choice but to hold
  out our begging bowls and tell ourselves that something is better than
  nothing. But leaving Spotify is about more than the money. The Spotify chief
  executive, Daniel Ek, recently led a €600m ($1.07bn) investment in a German
  defence company called Helsing, which specialises in AI-driven autonomous
  weapon systems, through his investment firm Prima Materia. Ek is also the
  chairman of Helsing, having joined the board in 2021 when his investment fund
  Prima Materia put €100m into the then-startup. Ek isn’t paid a salary by
  Spotify – he takes a share of its stock, last year alone cashing out a
  reported $345m. So here we are, artists helping to build algorithms to sell
  our music – and the success of that algorithm determines the flow of wealth to
  a man who invests in building machines that could kill people. In recent
  years, we’ve witnessed the horror of AI drone wars in Ukraine and Gaza –
  children killed and hospitals destroyed with the press of the space bar. Ek is
  investing in technology that can cause suffering and death. Spotify used to
  seem like a necessary evil. By association, it now just seems evil. So I have
  decided to remove my music from the platform. Many other artists have done the
  same thing. The removal of my works won’t make any significant dent in the
  company’s profits. It won’t change my earnings much either, but I can no
  longer be complicit. I don’t want my songs – some written with survivors of
  conflict – to enrich a man who helps to fund weapons. And I am urging everyone
  else to quit Spotify. There are alternatives. These platforms (what a soulless
  word) are not perfect, but at least they aren’t owned by individuals who align
  themselves with the arms race. If you’re an artist, I ask you to think hard
  about where your music lives. If you’re a listener, consider where your money
  goes. And as a music industry, let’s think hard about who we take sponsorship
  from. We can’t keep handing our creativity, our loyalty and our cash to amoral
  tech giants who see music as content and war as business. I’d rather earn
  nothing than profit from destruction. As Deerhoof succinctly put it in their
  statement on leaving Spotify: “If the price of ‘discoverability’ is letting
  oligarchs fill the globe with computerised weaponry, we’re going to pass on
  the supposed benefit.” David Bridie is an independent musician, producer and
  installation artist. Across four decades as a band member, solo artist and
  composer of film and TV soundtracks, he has released more than 30 albums. He
  is also the founder and artistic director of Wantok Musik Foundation, a
  not-for-profit music label that records, releases and promotes culturally
  infused music from Indigenous Australia, Melanesia and Oceania
