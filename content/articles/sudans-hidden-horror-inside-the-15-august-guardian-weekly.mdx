  While the wars raging in Ukraine and Gaza have dominated global news agendas
  for months turning into years, relatively little attention has been paid to
  the ongoing civil war in Sudan – which for many western media outlets remains
  out of sight and largely out of mind. This can’t be said of the Guardian’s
  Mark Townsend, who has reported tirelessly on the effects of the war between
  the Arab-led Rapid Support Forces and Sudanese military since it broke out in
  April 2023. It’s a conflict that has been characterised by repeated
  atrocities, forcing millions from their homes and causing the world’s largest
  humanitarian crisis. In April this year, just as a British-led conference was
  being held in London to explore how to end the war, one such atrocity was
  unfolding in Zamzam refugee camp in North Darfur. Details were at first
  sketchy, but only now – thanks to the piecing together of intelligence reports
  and witness testimony – can it be revealed what happened during the attack on
  the camp by RSF forces and why it was not stopped. As Mark’s remarkable
  account reveals, the 72-hour rampage in April may have taken the lives of more
  than 1,500 civilians in one of the most notorious war crimes of Sudan’s
  catastrophic conflict. Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home address

  a bold cricket musical to a nine-hour documentary, gritty crime dramas to
  frothy tales of revenge *** What else we’ve been reading • The relationship
  between British pubs and food has always been an odd one. Traditionally they
  offered little more than a curled-up cheese sandwich – or more often nothing
  at all. Then in the 1990s, gastropubs arrived and changed the game. Nowadays,
  big chains dominate pub kitchens with microwaves and disappointing fare once
  again. Steve Rose bemoans the current state of British pub food, but offers
  grounds for hope. Anthony Naughton, assistant editor • Sylvia Arthur’s
  interviews with women across west Africa who’d beaten an average life
  expectancy of 59 was wise and life-affirming. I heartily agree with this pearl
  from eightysomething Isatou Jarju: “Men are just a hindrance. They are the
  very definition of driving backwards.” Isobel Montgomery, deputy editor ***
