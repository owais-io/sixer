  Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. The hunt for Porepunkah shooting
  suspect Dezi Freeman has entered its third day as severe weather conditions in
  Victoria’s high country are expected to hamper police efforts. Parts of the
  state’s north-east were blanketed with fresh winter snow on Wednesday night.
  As one of the strongest cold fronts of the season approaches the alpine
  region, Victoria’s police minister has said the force is “throwing everything”
  at the manhunt. Specialist police continued to scour bushland around the rural
  property where detective leading senior constable Neal Thompson, 59, and
  senior constable Vadim De Waart, 35, were allegedly killed by Freeman. Follow

  morning, police have been searching for Dezi Freeman, a so-called “sovereign
