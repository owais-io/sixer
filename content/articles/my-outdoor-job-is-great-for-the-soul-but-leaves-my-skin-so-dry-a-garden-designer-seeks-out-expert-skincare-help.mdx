  “I’m a garden designer living in Norwich and I teach at the Norfolk School of
  Gardening. Every week can look different. I spend a fair bit of time outside
  and also in my studio, in the classroom or at clients’ houses. In the morning
  it’s shower, moisturiser, makeup, that kind of thing. I use a foaming face
  wash and a gel day-moisturiser. I also use a Boots factor 50 on top. I wear
  fairly light makeup – a pressed powder or a tinted moisturiser if I want
  something a bit more fancy. Then I might go down to my garden studio to start
  work at my desk. I tend to have appointments most days – I’ll jump in the car
  and head off to do a consultation visit or present a design to a client. I go
  all over the county, so I can be in city gardens or beautiful countryside. My
  work leaves me quite exposed to the weather – I can’t always be in the shade
  when it’s sunny, and I’m prone to prickly heat. In winter in Norfolk, we get
  these drying winds, as well as the cold and wet. Dryness is a huge factor for
  my skin. I think being half Indian, I’m prone to dry skin anyway. If I didn’t
  moisturise my arms and legs as well as my face and neck every day, I’d be in
  real trouble. When I had quite bad postnatal depression, I neglected myself
  and ended up with snake-skin scars on my shins for a long time.” Dr Ifeoma
  Ejikeme Dr Ejikeme says: “Rajul describes textbook transepidermal water loss,
  essentially losing water from the skin, made worse by exposure to wind, cold
  and seasonal shifts. To support all-day comfort and barrier strength, her
  moisturiser needs both humectants, which help keep skin moist, and
  lipid-replenishing ingredients, to support the skin barrier, and this should
  help prevent the feeling of dryness. Rajul could start by using the new Modern
  Chemistry by Boots Restore Moisturiser with rice extract and niacinamide. It’s
  lightweight but effective and can be used twice a day. Niacinamide brightens
  and strengthens, rice extract hydrates and soothes. A light, non-sticky
  texture is often preferred by people who aren’t used to moisturiser. I’m sorry
  to hear Rajul had postnatal depression. In the post pregnancy period, women
  often feel they don’t have time for themselves. It’s good to hear that now she
  is able to focus on her wellbeing and skin health. Her skin sounds
  particularly dry so ensuring she drinks enough water during the day and
  continuing to use moisturiser daily and all over her body can help with this
  extreme dryness.” “Then you’ve got the days on site. During the construction
  phase of a garden, there’s all sorts going on, from timber work to digging and
  soil preparation to slabs and stone cutting. I don’t do hard landscaping, but
  I’ll be on site to see what’s happening. Where I’m hands on is with the
  planting, and that’s quite physical. They tend to be no makeup days, dirty and
  sweaty, or the weather could be cold and wet. Other days, I’m at the school
  teaching – we’ve got a classroom in the grounds of a beautiful Georgian house.
  I’ll often be walking around the gardens showing my students different plants.
  ‘I’m surrounded by scents and textures and colours, which I love’ My husband
  cooks and we all eat together – I have two teenagers so it’s a time to chat
  and catch up. Then I tend to have a quiet evening. I like to read or listen to
  audio books, then bedtime. My routine is pretty simple, I’m usually in my
  pyjamas with my bra off already anyway. I use a micellar water makeup remover
  and then moisturiser. It’s only recently that I’ve started using a night-time
  moisturiser. My skin was terrible about two or three years ago. Menopause was
  kicking in and I had acne and got really stressed. I’m now being more rigorous
  in taking care of my skin. My 16-year-old daughter suggested a few things, so
  the moisturisers and things I use are a little bit more carefully thought
  about. I didn’t even really wash my face with anything other than water and I
  was quite lazy about removing my makeup. That’s one thing I’m much better at
  these days.” Dr Ejikeme says: “Rajul’s skin is being shaped by hormonal
  shifts, particularly menopause, which can alter oil production, skin hydration
  and texture. Rajul is right to have reviewed the products she’s using. I’d
  suggest switching to a gentle skincare routine that focuses on hydration to
  suit her skin’s evolving needs. I’d add Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore
  Hydrating Serum with niacinamide and ashwagandha to her routine. Niacinamide
  improves the appearance of skin tone and texture while ashwagandha offers
  protection from oxidative stress, so it’s ideal post-menopause.” “I always
  feel like a beginner with any beauty regime. I got away with not doing much
  for such a long time that I never really worried about it. And you know what
  teenagers are like now, they’re so into it, even though their skin is fine!
  ‘Working with nature, with plants and gardens can be tough on the skin, but
  it’s wonderful for the soul’ My skin has been really sensitive at times and
  I’ve reacted to any product that’s too rich and heavy – resulting in acne.
  I’ve also occasionally developed eczema on my elbows if I’m not careful to
  moisturise them.” Dr Ejikeme says: “Skin sensitivity can occur for all sorts
  of reasons, from over-cleansing to reacting to products or the environment. In
  those with oily skin, using rich occlusive creams (which create a protective
  barrier) can block pores and trigger breakouts. I’d say that Rajul’s skin
  needs balancing, and she needs to be careful not to strip it, so that means
  gentle hydrators and non-comedogenic [pore-clogging] options that deliver
  moisture in lighter layers. After cleansing add in Modern Chemistry by Boots
  Restore Essence Toner with niacinamide and ginseng, which delivers lightweight
  hydration without clogging pores, ideal for sensitive or combination skin. In
  the evening, to improve texture and reduce the risk of breakouts, gently
  exfoliate once or twice a week with Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Exfoliating
  AHA/BHA Toner. This helps refine texture and reduce post-breakout blemishes
  without irritating the skin when used after cleansing.” “Working with nature,
  with plants and gardens can be tough on the skin, but it’s wonderful for the
  soul. I’m aware of the seasons changing. I’m surrounded by scents and textures
  and colours, which I love and I get to create beautiful spaces for people. I
  develop relationships with my clients – I have to learn a bit about them to
  create a garden that’s right for them, which is such a treat. For me, seeing
  wildlife suddenly in places where it wasn’t before – you create a garden and
  then bugs and birds and all sorts come to it – is such a privilege. It makes
  me feel like I’m improving the world a bit.” Rajul’s Modern Chemistry formula
  Dr Ejikeme’s summary: “Rajul is taking thoughtful steps to care for her skin,
  especially as it changes with menopause and outdoor exposure. By building on
  this with hydrating, soothing ingredients such as niacinamide, rice extract
  and ashwagandha from the Modern Chemistry by Boots range, she can strengthen
  her skin barrier, ease sensitivity and maintain moisture throughout the day.”
