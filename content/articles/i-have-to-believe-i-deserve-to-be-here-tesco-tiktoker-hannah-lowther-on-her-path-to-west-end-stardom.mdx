  ‘I have to believe I deserve to be here’: ‘Tesco TikToker’ Hannah Lowther on
  her path to West End stardom

  If you’re on TikTok, you’ll probably recognise Hannah Lowther. Known
  affectionately as the “Tesco TikToker”, she found viral fame during lockdown
  by filming herself singing and dancing in the aisles of the supermarket during
  her shifts there. “I got 10,000 views on a video and I thought: OK, that’s it,
  I’m famous, and I just never let it go,” the 27-year-old laughs. Since then,
  Lowther has built an audience of 1.2 million followers and leveraged her
  social media presence into a starry stage career, landing roles in West End
  musicals including Heathers and Six. “At the back of my mind, I was thinking:
  You know what? Maybe this could help me one day.” Her career is the stuff of
  many young performers’ dreams. Using social media, Lowther took her career
  into her own hands, built an army of fans, and catapulted herself to the
  spotlight. Now, she stands at the forefront of a growing and debated shift in
  the industry: one that sees performers with big online followings take centre
  stage. Lowther always knew she wanted to work in the theatre. Growing up in
  Basingstoke, she went to dance classes, but it was when she was cast as
  Brigitta Von Trapp in the West End production of The Sound of Music in 2008
  that something clicked. “I remember going into the theatre and asking [the
  adult actors] what their jobs were,” she says. “Then I realised this was an
  option for me.” Her teenage years were consumed by musical theatre. “I put the
  blinkers on. I thought: I’m going to do this and nothing else.” At 16, she
  took a three-year course at the drama school Italia Conti then, at 19, went on
  to the London School of Musical Theatre. “I graduated in 2019, did a panto at
  Christmas, and then in 2020, coronavirus happened,” Lowther says. “I got put
  on pause. The whole world did.” Except Lowther didn’t stop. She took a job at
  Tesco and, “out of pure boredom”, made her first TikTok video. Her early posts
  saw her belting out musical theatre hits to products on the shelves and
  high-kicking in front of the tills. “I was feeling like my musical theatre
  spark was diminishing,” she says. “I just thought surely someone else must
  feel the same.” She was right. Her TikToks reached thousands and were picked
  up by BBC and ITV news. “It was crazy: people came to interview me, people
  came into the store … I’m just that theatre kid who loves attention, so it was
  my dream,” Lowther says. Even now, she shakes her head in disbelief. “TikTok
  really helped me, and I say that with pride.” Her unconventional route to the
  stage hasn’t been without its critics. Despite training at two of the UK’s top
  drama schools, Lowther is often met with scepticism from people who attribute
  her success to her social media clout than talent. “People are always going to
  be a little bit apprehensive about [social media],” Lowther says. Strangers
  have often formed an opinion of her before they’ve even met. “Often when I
  meet them, they’ll be like: ‘You know what? You’re actually quite nice,’” she
  laughs. It is true that in person, Lowther is different from the version seen
  online. On TikTok, she’s all jazz hands and musical theatre fizz. Today, she
  is more reserved: still warm and funny, but with a vulnerability that doesn’t
  always make it into the frame. Lowther tells me about how she turned her phone
  off for a week after a video surfaced of her making a mistake during an early
  performance of Six. “My first thought was: I’m going to get ripped to shreds
  online, and that’s exactly what happened.” Because of her trajectory, Lowther
  faces a far greater level of scrutiny than most performers. Dealing with
  online criticism has become a part of her life. Underneath her videos, she
  often finds “nasty comments” about her voice, career and, most prominently,
  suggestions that she’s used social media to cheat her way to success. “I’ve
  tried to teach myself to rise above it, and think that is more a reflection of
  the person than me, but it is easier said than done,” she says. To an extent,
  the torrent of abuse has begun to feel normal. “I forget that, for lots of
  people, it is not a daily struggle.” Perhaps this is why Lowther occasionally
  doubts herself. “Impostor syndrome is a real thing. This explosion happened so
  fast, sometimes I do sit there thinking: What am I doing at this audition?”
  She’s the first to say her road to theatre has been far from normal. The first
  West End show she was cast in, Heathers, came about because someone she met at
  a social media event was friends with one of the producers, and got her an
  audition. “It’s hard when I’m faced with people saying: ‘Why would she get
  this part?’ I’ve worked hard. I have to stick to my guns and believe I deserve
  to be in certain spaces.” Lowther believes more musical theatre hopefuls will
  turn to social media. In June, it was announced that TikTok star Maddie Grace
  Jepson, who has 1.9 million followers, will make her West End debut in Back to
  the Future: The Musical, while Love Island winner Amber Davies (1.2 million
  followers on Instagram) has since starred in countless shows, including the
  current run of The Great Gatsby. This is a marked change from the more
  traditional path actors usually take: many will spend years working their way
  up through off-West End roles, understudying and attending endless auditions
  before getting a big break. Today, casting directors and producers
  increasingly see a strong online following as part of a performer’s value:
  their fans, it is assumed, are a ready-made audience. For some, this is a
  welcome levelling of the playing field that helps regional or working-class
  performers who lack industry connections. But there are concerns. If you’re
  expected to perform in an eight-show week, proper training and stamina are
  essential – and not always something guaranteed by social media popularity.
  And this all arguably creates a hierarchy of another kind. Actors have spoken
  out against being asked about their follower count in the smallest
  non-speaking roles. In 2019, a casting call for a commercial asked actors to
  have “more than 5,000 followers on Instagram” went viral, leading to broader
  criticism in the industry. Everybody’s Talking About Jamie star Hayley
  Tamaddon said she was asked, at the end of a West End audition, about the
  number of followers she had on X (the role went to someone with 20,000 more
  followers). Despite her time at drama school, it is clear that it’s TikTok
  that has opened doors for Lowther. She now hosts a theatre podcast, How Very
  Hannah (the podcast’s own TikTok account has more than 52,800 followers) which
  is going on a UK tour this autumn. “We play silly games, I give advice to
  people who send in questions, I chat with guests and try to remove any
  snootiness around theatre,” she says. That personal audience gives Lowther
  something many other young actors don’t have: leverage. She doesn’t have to
  wait to be cast to engage an audience, promote her work or generate income;
  she has built her own stage. It’s a powerful position. Does creating a
  public-facing brand ever get in the way of being taken seriously as a stage
  actor? “By trade, I am an actress,” she says cautiously, but she reveals that
  some people in the industry have initially turned up their noses at her
  influencer life. Why does Lowther think people are so keen to follow her life?
  She pauses. “It’s a weird one. As cheesy as it is to say, I try to be as
  authentic as possible … I try to show the lows, the highs and all the bits in
  between.” Lowther’s appeal does seem to be rooted in her honesty. She posts
  videos of her crying after failed auditions, hosts chats from her dressing
  room, and answers questions about how much actors really get paid. Part of the
  draw is that she isn’t too flashy or aloof. Her relatability offers other
  young performers a sense of hope: maybe, if they throw themselves into social
  media, they could have a career like hers too. Of course, out of the many
  people who post on TikTok, only a few will end up in the spotlight. Lowther is
  more than aware of this, and is determined not to fall behind. She still posts
  regularly on TikTok and feels a responsibility to make content that’s honest,
  joyful and rooted in her love of musical theatre. She has big dreams of being
  in a movie musical – “something like the Wicked movie” – but, ultimately, the
  theatre has her heart. “I really love being on stage. I feel like it is where
  I’m meant to be.” How Very Hannah Live! tours the UK to 29 November; tour
  starts Edinburgh.
