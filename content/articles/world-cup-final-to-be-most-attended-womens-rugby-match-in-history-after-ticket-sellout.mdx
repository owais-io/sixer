  The Women’s Rugby World Cup final at Twickenham next month is already an
  82,000 sellout, bullish organisers have announced, and will be the most
  attended women’s rugby union match in history. The figure surpasses the 66,000
  fans who packed the Stade de France for each session of the women’s rugby
  sevens tournament at the Paris Olympic Games, and organisers say ticket sales
  across the tournament have also vastly exceeded expectations. So far more than
  375,000 tickets – which start at £10 for adults and £5 for children – have
  been sold, which is three times the number that were sold for the 2021 Women’s
  Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. The news was announced by Gill Whitehead,
  chair of the Women’s Rugby World Cup, at a press conference in the buildup to
  the tournament opener between England and USA at the Stadium of Light on
  Friday. “The final we are very confident will be the most attended women’s
  rugby match in history, easily surpassing the 66,000 crowd that we saw in
  Paris 2024,” Whitehead said. “I can confirm the final at Allianz Stadium will
  be sold out. The last time England hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup [in
  2010], the girls played at the Stoop around the corner to a crowd of 13,000.
  “I started playing women’s rugby 30 years ago and the prospect of girls
  running out of the tunnel, playing to the three tiers of Allianz packed to the
  rafters, is something perhaps I never hoped or thought I would see and it’s
  certainly what girls’ dreams are made of.” More than 40,000 tickets have been
  sold for England’s game against USA but Sally Horrox, the World Rugby chief of
  women’s rugby, was confident that it would be close to a 50,000 sellout by
  kick-off. “The sport has grown significantly over the last three years,” she
  said. “But it’s hugely important now that we make the very most of this
  opportunity right in front of us over the next six weeks.” Sarah Massey,
  managing director of the tournament, said that more than 80% of tickets had
  been sold and that this would rise. She was confident those who had bought
  tickets would show up and be entranced by the spectacle. “We’re ready to break
  records in attendances, viewership and engagement,” she said. “This is going
  to be the biggest global celebration of women’s rugby that we have ever seen.
  We’ve now sold 375,000 tickets across all those matches, surpassing all our
  initial ticket targets. “That’s also three times the number of tickets that
  were sold for the last Women’s Rugby World Cup. You’re going to see thrilling
  action, electric atmospheres, and be quick because those remaining tickets are
  really selling up fast.”
