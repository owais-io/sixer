  After his Liverpool team lost the Community Shield in a penalty shootout to
  Crystal Palace, their manager, Arne Slot admitted the difficulty of bedding in
  the summer’s new signings. “Sometimes you need some time to adapt offensively
  or defensively,” said Slot. Two new arrivals in striker Hugo Ekitiké and
  right-back Jeremie Frimpong got on the scoresheet but Palace, who might have
  won the game in normal time during their impressive second-half showing,
  exposed the Premier League champions’ weaknesses. Florian Wirtz in a No 10
  role and Milos Kerkez as an overlapping left-back on the opposite side of
  Frimpong made for a highly attacking Liverpool lineup. “In the whole
  pre-season we saw we are able to create more opportunities, chances, we
  dominate maybe even more,” said Slot. “Now we are better in creating and
  getting promising situations than we were in the whole of last season but it
  is also true that we have conceded two against [Athletic Club] Bilbao and two
  again today. “We need to be better defensively,” Slot admitted: “It is
  disappointing of course, if you go in front and you are not able to win the
  game. It was close and there were points where I thought we could win it but
  it went to penalties and they were better in that moment.” Slot refused to
  panic before his team’s defence of the Premier League title, which kicks off
  on Friday against Bournemouth. He said: “We are Liverpool, the pressure is
  always on. Even if we bring 10 players in, or no players in, there is always
  pressure when you wear a Liverpool shirt.” He offered measured credit to Wirtz
  and Ekitiké: “These are players we have brought in for quite a lot of money so
  they know how to handle the pressure. Both of them played a good game.” The
  Palace manager Oliver Glasner was delighted to add further silverware to last
  season’s FA Cup. He said: “I have to give big credit to the players for this
  win today, we came back and were able to decide the game on penalties. We were
  on the same level as Liverpool and it was a big performance.” Asked whether he
  would swap victory at Wembley for the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling in
  Palace’s favour on Monday over playing in the Europa League or Conference
  League, Glasner said: “No, we will accept this. Tomorrow we have no influence
  so we will celebrate tonight and then meet for lunch at training. Then we will
  schedule the rest of August. If we play in the Conference League, we have more
  games in August.”
