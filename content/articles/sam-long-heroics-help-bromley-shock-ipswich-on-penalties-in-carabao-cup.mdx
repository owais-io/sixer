  This remains a new world for Bromley. Recent entrants to the Football League,
  this meeting with Ipswich was just their second Carabao Cup contest – now they
  have their first victory, delivered on penalties against a side who were in
  the top tier three months ago. After Ben Johnson cancelled out Deji Elerewe’s
  first-half opener for Bromley, the game went to sudden death and the night
  belonged to Sam Long. He saved Ipswich’s first penalty, low to his right off
  George Hirst, and was required for another, denying Ali Al-Hamadi, once a
  Bromley player. Marcus Ifill slotted in for the final blow. It proved to be a
  memorable moment for a club not short of them in recent years. “Show them a
  level of respect but don’t roll over and just say: ‘Come in here and nick all
  our crown jewels and go home with the win,’” the Bromley manager, Andy
  Woodman, said in explaining his pre‑game instructions. “Let’s go out there and
  give an account of ourselves. I’m probably not a household name as a manager,
  but my team and me, we work our socks off to cover everything. And my team
  represents me very well.” This game brought together two managers who are 15
  years and two divisions apart but with similar stories to tell. Kieran McKenna
  and Woodman joined their respective clubs in 2021, leaving behind the luxury
  of the Premier League; McKenna departed Manchester United’s staff, Woodman was
  head of goalkeeping at Arsenal. Both have packed plenty of history in the past
  four years, McKenna most notably with back-to-back promotions; Woodman with
  his side’s ascension into the Football League last year, a first for the club
  founded in 1892. The 3G pitch at Hayes Lane was subsequently ripped out and
  replaced by grass to fulfil league requirements, symbolic for a club wanting
  more. Bromley finished last season four points off the League Two playoffs and
  reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time, even taking the lead
  at St James’ Park before Newcastle won 3-1. Ipswich, days after an intense
  Championship opener with Birmingham, were well positioned for a serious scare.
  Bromley’s special occasion was not to get in the way of rotation, both sides
  much changed from their last outings. Michael Cheek, the leading goalscorer in
  League Two last season, was left on the home bench. McKenna handed a first
  Ipswich start to Ashley Young, older than his manager but still up for a trek
  down the right. He eased through the first half as Ipswich dominated
  possession but failed to create. Jack Clarke was lively when cutting in from
  the left; the overlapping Leif Davis enjoyed the space created and launched
  his cutbacks. But they could not get past the Bromley centre-half Omar
  Sowunmi, towering over Al-Hamadi and in control at the back. Fittingly,
  Sowunmi was key at the other end, too. Leaping high from a corner just before
  half-time, he headed into the middle for Elerewe, who glanced in to prompt the
  roar. There was more joy for Bromley supporters after the break as Cheek came
  on under lights, ready to hassle up top. Ipswich, nonetheless, went level
  through a half-time change of their own. Chiedozie Ogbene thundered down the
  right wing before Conor Chaplin seized on the cross, his close-range volley
  tipped on to the crossbar by Long. But Johnson’s arrival into the box was
  perfectly timed, the rebound slotted in. Bromley came close when Marcus
  Dinanga was denied inside the area by Christian Walton as the game turned more
  frenetic around the hour. But the net refused to bustle, with Al-Hamadi and
  Ifill going close in the dying exchanges. The latter had his moment not long
  after.
