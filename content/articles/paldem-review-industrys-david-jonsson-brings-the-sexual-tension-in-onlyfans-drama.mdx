  Kevin and Megan are friends who reap the benefits when a one-night stand is
  accidentally caught on camera. It captures them at it and she (Natasha Cowley)
  likes the outcome. “We’re hot,” she says to him (Michael Workeye), watching
  back the footage. So their pornographic OnlyFans account is born, providing
  homemade sex videos and an income stream. Written by David Jonsson, an actor
  and Bafta Rising Star who has appeared in Industry and Rye Lane, this debut is
  one of the most anticipated offerings of the fringe. Directed by Zi Alikhan,
  who has also worked on Industry, it is an adventurous setup but its central
  sexual drama does not quite come off. Part of the problem is that it is
  handled too gingerly rather than fully penetrated, as it were. So it is too
  restrained, its drama and ideas not fully realised. The dialogue is vibrant
  but unnatural as the couple repartee in witty one-liners. There are growing
  tensions in their relationship but you do not access its emotional complexity
  – need, desire, resentment, maybe even love. There is not enough context
  either and too much is left unspoken: Kevin is a photographer but beyond that
  we learn little about him, and even less about Megan. The OnlyFans storyline
  in itself has potential but goes nowhere. The set looks like a living room cum
  photographic studio, with a screen on which videoed images are projected.
  There is a strange kind of sterility when the sex scenes are enacted. It is
  maybe an encapsulation of the awkwardness of homemade pornography. Still, we
  are told that this couple has great sex yet there are few fireworks between
  them. Things become more amusing when another couple joins the fray but this
  also flips the tone into satire, so it seems. There are a few other
  illuminating glimmers: Kevin says he enjoys watching Megan watching him
  enjoying himself on screen (“circles of desire”). It is a good observation.
  But not enough is carried through. Racial tensions between the couple come
  flooding in at the end, too late and truncated. There is great potential here
  nonetheless. If this play could find a better focus, it might just have
  something. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh
