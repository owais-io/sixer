  The head of the UK’s air traffic control company is facing calls to resign
  after the second disruption to flights in two years due to technical problems.
  Hundreds of flights were delayed after the air traffic control (ATC) system
  went down for about 20 minutes on Wednesday. Nats, the company that runs the
  system, blamed a technical problem and said it had now been resolved. The
  problems raised fears of a repeat of chaos at airports in August 2023 when
  hundreds of thousands of passengers’ flights were delayed or cancelled.
  British Airways said it was forced to restrict the number of its inbound and
  outbound flights at Heathrow to 32 an hour until 7.15pm. It said the flow rate
  would then return to the usual level of 45 an hour. It is understood that the
  UK National Cyber Security Centre does not view it as a hacking incident.
  Ryanair called for the Nats chief executive, Martin Rolfe, to resign or be
  fired. The airline’s chief operating officer, Neal McMahon, said: “It is
  outrageous that passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption
  due to Martin Rolfe’s continued mismanagement of Nats. “Yet another ATC system
  failure has resulted in the closure of UK airspace meaning thousands of
  passengers’ travel plans have been disrupted. It is clear that no lessons have
  been learned since the August 2023 Nats system outage, and passengers continue
  to suffer as a result of Martin Rolfe’s incompetence.” A Department for
  Transport spokesperson said: “While passengers should continue to check with
  individual airports for advice, Nats have confirmed their systems are now
  fully operational and flights are returning to normal. “We are working closely
  with Nats to understand the cause of the technical issue and the implications
  for the resilience systems in place.” The department noted the transport
  secretary, Heidi Alexander, does not have any direct control over Nats and has
  no powers on staffing decisions. Wednesday’s air traffic control technical
  fault came as many thousands of families prepared to head off on their summer
  holiday, writes Rupert Jones and Zoe Wood. Those whose flights have been
  disrupted have significant rights and entitlements in relation to everything
  from refreshments to refunds. John Carr, whose plane was cancelled from
  Heathrow Airport, said he was worried he would miss his brother’s wedding.
  Carr, a chiropodist from Stourbridge, was on his way to Norway with a group of
  friends to help setup his brother’s wedding, for which he is best man, when he
  found out after checking in his flight was cancelled. The 35-year-old told the
  PA news agency from outside Terminal 3: “I’m pretty gutted. We’ve got loads of
  stuff in the suitcases to set up the venue, because we’re obviously flying to
  Norway. We’ve got the wedding rehearsal to do. It’s quite stressful.” His
  friend James Hedges, also from Stourbridge, added: “We found out today; we’d
  already checked in and gone through the security checks. “We were in the
  departures lounge, and we were literally sitting down having a burger when it
  came up on the (screen). Our flight was still showing as if it was leaving,
  and they were waiting to give us a gate and that that would be given at
  4.45pm. When that time came around, it then switched to cancelled.” Daniel
  McAfee, head of legal operations at Lawhive, has shared advice on the actions
  that affected passengers can take. “Under UK and EU regulations (UK Regulation
  261/2004), airlines are generally not obligated to pay compensation for
  cancellations or delays caused by extraordinary circumstances. Air traffic
  control issues fall under this category, meaning passengers are not entitled
  to compensation for the inconvenience. “Even though compensation may not be
  available, passengers still have rights. If your flight is cancelled due to
  ATC problems, the airline must offer you a full refund or an alternative
  flight to your destination at the earliest opportunity. You may also choose to
  rebook the flight for a later date, if this is more convenient for you.”
  McAfee added: “Additionally, airlines are still required to provide care and
  assistance during delays, even those caused by ATC issues. This includes meals
  and refreshments (proportional to the waiting time), accommodation and
  transport to and from the hotel (if an overnight stay becomes necessary), and
  communication (the airline must cover the cost of two phone calls, faxes, or
  emails to help you make any necessary arrangements).” Junade Ali, a fellow at
  the Institution of Engineering and Technology, said: “Nats has previously
  thoroughly investigated such incidents and implemented suitable measures.
  “From prior incident reports, the software is understood to not compromise
  safety at the expense of keeping airspace open. “This is the right approach
  as, whilst keeping airspace open is important, the public risk appetite
  demands a high standard of safety when it comes to air travel.” At least 45
  flights have been cancelled across all UK airports as of 17.30 BST, data
  shows. Aviation analytics firm Cirium told the BBC: “Today, 30 July 2025, has
  seen a total of 45 departures cancelled so far, across all UK airports. “There
  has also been a total of 35 arrivals cancelled so far, across all UK airports.
  “London Heathrow has seen the highest number of cancellations so far, with a
  total of 16 departures and seven arrivals so far. “There were also more than
  16 flights en route to London Heathrow that had to be diverted to other
  airports.” It is understood that the UK National Cyber Security Centre does
  not view today’s incident as a hack. The Liberal Democrats have called for an
  urgent investigation into the causes of today’s air traffic control glitch. In
  comments carried by PA news agency and echoing Ryanair’s frustration (17:29),
  the party’s leader Ed Davey said: “It is utterly unacceptable that after a
  major disruption just two years ago, air traffic control has once again been
  hit by a technical fault. With thousands of families preparing to go on a
  well-earned break, this just isn’t good enough. The Government should launch
  an urgent investigation to ensure the system is fit for purpose, including
  ruling out hostile action as a cause. The public deserve to have full
  confidence in such a vital piece of national infrastructure.” First stories of
  passengers missing their flights as a result of disruption emerge on social
  media, with an Italian user expressing their frustration over a missed
  connection to New York after their flight from Milan to London was diverted to
  Paris. Since Ryanair’s McMahon mentioned lessons learned from the 2023
  incident, let’s take a quick look at what they were. Publishing its review of
  the 2023 outage that affected 700,000 passengers, the UK Civil Aviation
  Authority said in November last year that Nats should “review its contingency
  and engineering resource management arrangements” and look at “providing
  earlier notification to airlines and airports of possible disruption.” It also
  added that airlines and airports should “review the adequacy of the support
  available to passengers during significant disruption, in particular to
  vulnerable passengers and those travelling with children, and to develop a
  standardised suite of passenger information during major incidents.” I think
  it’s fair to say we can expect some of these issues to be given more attention
  again in the weeks ahead as a result of today’s outage. Budget airline Ryanair
  has called for Nats’ chief executive Martin Rolfe to resign after today’s
  outage, PA news agency reported, warning that “no lessons have been learnt”
  after the August 2023 system outage (16:52). In a very blunt statement,
  Ryanair’s chief operating officer Neal McMahon said: “It is outrageous that
  passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption due to Martin
  Rolfe’s continued mismanagement of Nats. Yet another ATC system failure has
  resulted in the closure of UK airspace meaning thousands of passengers’ travel
  plans have been disrupted. It is clear that no lessons have been learnt since
  the Aug 2023 Nats system outage, and passengers continue to suffer as a result
  of Martin Rolfe’s incompetence. If Nats CEO Martin Rolfe fails to resign on
  the back of this latest Nats system outage that has disrupted thousands of
  passengers yet again, then UK transport minister Heidi Alexander must act
  without delay to remove Martin Rolfe and deliver urgent reform of Nats’
  shambolic ATC service, so that airlines and passengers are no longer forced to
  endure these preventable delays caused by persistent Nats failures.” The
  Eurocontrol’s live traffic map – previously showing an orange alert over the
  UK – has now cleared, indicating that the issue is now resolved. British
  Airways still faces the number of inbound and outbound flights at Heathrow
  restricted at just over two-thirds of the usual flow rate, PA news agency
  reported. The company said it can only operate 32 flights per hour until
  7.15pm before it is expected to be able to return to the usual level of 45
  flights per hour. London Stansted airport is the latest to issue an update to
  passengers, saying that while the issue has been resolved, “there may be some
  ongoing impact to flights schedules so passengers due to travel are advised to
  consult their airlines for updates.” Worth stressing even a small and
  time-limited outage in what is an incredibly congested London area and beyond
  can cause substantial disruptions as flights are diverted – and out of
  position – and/or delayed and may struggle to complete their normal, packed
  schedule. National air traffic services, or Nats, has just confirmed that “our
  systems are fully operational and air traffic capacity is returning to
  normal.” It added: “Departures at all airports have resumed and we are working
  with affected airlines and airports to clear the backlog safely. We apologise
  to everyone affected by this issue.” UK transport secretary Heidi Alexander
  says in a post on X that she believes the traffic control systems “have now
  been restored,” although she warns about “continued disruption … expected.” “I
  am aware of a technical issue which impacted @NATS operations causing travel
  disruption this afternoon. I have been informed systems have now been restored
  but continued disruption is expected, and passengers should check with
  individual airports for advice.” Edinburgh Airport just confirmed its
  departures have also resumed, but added that the disruption “will take time to
  work through”. More flights are now taking off from airports that previously
  reported being affected by the disruption, with American Airlines’ AAL137 to
  Los Angeles departing with a delay of just over two hours from London Heathrow
  just moments ago. UK Civil Aviation Authority is actively directing passengers
  to its guidance for passengers affected by delays, saying “remember that you
  have passenger rights if this happens.” London Gatwick airport has now
  reported that the issue impacting outbound flights “has now been resolved,”
  but warned that “there are some delays at London Gatwick while operations
  resume.” Flightradar24 data is now showing first flights departing from
  airports that previously reported disruptions, with British Airways SHT8W
  flight from London Heathrow Airport to Edinburgh taking off a moment ago, with
  about 55 minutes delay. Back in 2023, a previous glitch affecting Nats, the
  company that provides national air traffic control services in the UK, meant
  the system was out of action for several hours causing disruption to more than
  700,000 passengers. Here is what we know about what happened in 2023: There
  was also a similar outage at Nats national centre in Swanwick, Hampshire in
  2014, that resulted in dozens of flights being cancelled and delayed. The
  scale of the disruption caused by the outage is yet to become clear, but it’s
  worth remembering that this is happening during what is a very busy summer
  period, and so could have knock on effects on what is usually an already very
  tight flight schedule. We now have a further update from Nats, saying it has
  restored the system affected by the outage and will work with airlines to
  minimise disruption caused. Here is their statement: “Our engineers have now
  restored the system that was affected this afternoon. We are in the process of
  resuming normal operations in the London area. We continue to work closely
  with airline and airport customers to minimise disruption. We apologise for
  any inconvenience this has caused.” Edinburgh Airport has now reported being
  affected by the technical outage too. In a post on X, it said: “Due to a
  technical issue impacting NATS, all departures from Edinburgh Airport are
  currently being held. We are waiting for further information from NATS and
  will provide updates when possible. Please check with your airline for the
  latest information on your flight.” Flightradar24 tracking service reported
  earlier that “as per Eurocontrol, technical issues have closed the London CTA,
  affecting flights across the southern UK.” UK flights in the London area are
  affected by delays after Nats, the UK air traffic control authority, said it
  was restricting flights due to a “technical issue” at NATS Swanwick air
  traffic control centre “in order to ensure safety, which is always our first
  priority.” In a statement on social media, it added: “Our engineers are
  working hard to resolve the problem as quickly as possible and we are working
  closely with airlines to help minimise disruption. At this stage we cannot say
  how long it will be before operations are back to normal.” Gatwick Airport
  reported impact on all outbound flights across the UK, while London City
  Airport said “flights in and out of London airports - including London City
  Airport - might be delayed or subject to cancellation.”
