  control

  It was lunchtime on a Sunday in April when Martin Bryant pulled out a
  semiautomatic rifle and killed 12 people in 15 seconds within the close
  confines of the Broad Arrow cafe in the historic site of Port Arthur,
  Tasmania. The 1996 massacre, which went on to claim the lives of 35 people and
  wound another 23, prompted an unprecedented overhaul of Australia’s gun laws.
  “It means that this country, through its governments, has decided not to go
  down the American path,” then prime minister John Howard said as he pushed
  through a new national firearm agreement with the states. “It will involve
  sacrifice by some … but most of them I think will understand that there is a
  greater common good.” In the wake of the shooting, images of truckloads of
  guns being sent to scrap metal became emblematic of the government response at
  the time: a dramatic, national gun buyback that removed more than 650,000
  weapons from the community. As well as the gun amnesty, the government
  restricted semiautomatic weapons and introduced tighter licensing
  requirements, including the need for gun holders to demonstrate a “genuine
  reason” for ownership – which cannot include self-defence. The world-leading
  reforms led to an immediate decrease in the number of guns in the community.
  But while Australia has long been heralded as the gold standard for gun
  control, almost 30 years later, the landscape is shifting. Gun numbers are on
  the rise – there are now more than 4 million firearms in the Australian
  community, almost double the 2.2m weapons recorded in 2001, after the national
  firearms agreement, according to a report commissioned by gun safety groups.
  At least 2,000 new guns are lawfully entering the community every week. And
  while the number of gun licence holders per capita has gone down as
  Australia’s population has soared, there is now a larger number of guns in the
  community per capita than there was in the immediate aftermath of the
  crackdown. That’s because the number of guns per licence holder is going up –
  gun owners now average more than four firearms per licence. In Sydney, NSW
  firearm register data shows that there are more than 70 individuals who own
  more than 100 firearms. (Crucially, these are not deemed to be collectors,
  whose weapons are not functional.) And despite the Howard reforms promising
  uniform gun laws throughout Australia and the establishment of a national
  firearm register, 30 years later, this is not a reality. The states and
  territories are creeping towards the establishment of a new national firearms
  registry, but the gun lobby is pushing back as the details of how it will
  operate are still being negotiated. Other provisions of the national firearms
  agreement remain unimplemented, the country still has a hodgepodge of
  state-based laws and a lack of data transparency makes understanding
  Australia’s gun landscape difficult. In NSW, the government is considering
  enshrining a new “right to hunt” in law, while in WA shooting groups are
  mobilising against tough new licensing requirements. There are also growing
  concerns about weapons that circumvent our gun licensing system entirely.
  3D-printed firearms of increasing sophistication are now routinely seized by
  police as Australians tap into an online ecosystem that glorifies a so-called
  “unlimited right to keep and bear arms”. “We all got together after Port
  Arthur and everybody pulled together with the ban [on some semi-automatic and
  pump-action firearms] and the buyback,” said Andrew Hemming, an expert in
  criminal law at the University of Southern Queensland. “Well, the reality is …
  if anybody can make one, the sands have shifted and it’s only a question of
  time.” The gun lobby is quick to argue that licensed firearm holders are not
  the problem, likening the ownership of multiple guns to a golfer having
  multiple golf clubs. But it is an inescapable fact that legal firearms have
  been used in many high-profile homicides and are overwhelmingly used in
  suicides. Over the past decade, there have been almost 2,000 suicides by
  firearm and more than 200 homicides. Eight OECD countries, including the
  United Kingdom, have lower gun homicide rates than Australia. Gun theft is
  also an ongoing problem. Data compiled by the Guardian from state police shows
  that almost 9,000 firearms – most of them licensed – were stolen from 2020-24,
  with only a small percentage ever recovered. “We have done something that will
  send a signal to people all around this country, that ours is not a gun
  culture, ours is a culture of peaceful cooperation,” Howard said in 1996 when
  announcing the national firearm agreement. Almost 30 years on, Australia must
  grapple again with questions about its “gun culture”.
