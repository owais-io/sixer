  The agency that oversees Voice of America and other government-funded
  international broadcasters is eliminating jobs for more than 500 employees, a
  Trump administration official said. The move could ratchet up a months-long
  legal challenge over the news outlets’ fate. Kari Lake, acting CEO of the US
  Agency for Global Media, announced the latest round of job cuts late Friday,
  one day after a federal judge blocked her from removing Michael Abramowitz as
  VOA director. US district judge Royce Lamberth had ruled separately that the
  Republican administration had failed to show how it was complying with his
  orders to restore VOA’s operations. His order Monday gave the administration
  “one final opportunity, short of a contempt trial” to demonstrate its
  compliance. He ordered Lake to sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency
  employees by 15 September. On Thursday, Lamberth said Abramowitz could not be
  removed without the approval of the majority of the International Broadcasting
  Advisory Board. Firing Abramowitz would be “plainly contrary to law”,
  according to Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by Ronald Reagan. Lake
  posted a statement on social media that said her agency had initiated a
  reduction in force, or RIF, eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government
  employees. She said the agency “will continue to fulfill its statutory mission
  after this RIF– and will likely improve its ability to function”. “I look
  forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the
  functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America’s voice is heard
  abroad where it matters most,” she wrote. A group of agency employees who sued
  to block VOA’s elimination said Lake’s move would give their colleagues 30
  days until their pay and benefits end. “We find Lake’s continued attacks on
  our agency abhorrent,” they said in a statement. “We are looking forward to
  her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the
  rigorous review process that Congress requires. So far we have not seen any
  evidence of that.” They added: “We will continue to fight for what we believe
  to be our rights under the law.” In June, layoff notices were sent to more
  than 600 agency employees. Abramowitz was placed on administrative leave along
  with almost the entire VOA staff. He was told he would be fired effective 31
  August. The administration said in a court filing Thursday that it planned to
  send RIF notices to 486 employees of VOA and 46 other agency employees but
  intended to retain 158 agency employees and 108 VOA employees. The filing said
  the global media agency had 137 “active employees” and 62 other employees on
  administrative leave while VOA had 86 active employees and 512 others on
  administrative leave. The agency also houses Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,
  Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Martí, which
  beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. The networks, which together reach an
  estimated 427 million people, date to the cold war and are part of a network
  of government-funded organizations trying to extend US influence and combat
  authoritarianism. In March, Abramowitz warned that Trump’s attempts to
  dismantle the VOA would be a “self-inflicted blow” to American national
  security, saying: “If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our
  adversaries, then they’re going to be telling the narratives that people
  around the world are going to be hearing, and that can’t be good for America …
  They’re going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that
  with truth.” He added: “The major challenge for the United States in general
  is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are
  essentially really having our lunch. … So, I really feel that we need an
  organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth
  about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.”
  This week, Trump also moved to remove union protections from a handful of
  federal employees, including those from the VOA. In response, the American
  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the nation’s largest
  trade union of public employees, said: “AFSCME members who fulfill the
  Congressionally mandated mission to broadcast Voice of America around the
  globe shine the beacon of freedom on the most oppressive of regimes. Now,
  because they have been fighting to keep Voice of America’s mission alive,
  their own voice on the job has been stripped from them. AFSCME will fight this
  illegal action in court.” Earlier this year, foreign staff at US-backed media
  outlets voiced concerns over their safety following Trump’s shuttering of the
  global media agencies. Speaking to the Guardian in March, Jaewoo Park, a
  journalist for Radio Free Asia, said: “We have many co-workers in different
  services, several of whom came here and sought asylum visas. If their own
  government knew they worked for RFA [Radio Free Asia] and they went back to
  their own country, their lives would be at risk.” “Authoritarian governments
  have praised what Trump is doing right now … In Burma, Vietnam, Laos,
  Cambodia, there were people who fought for freedom and democracy, and they
  came to work at RFA. It’s very risky for them. Their lives are in danger if
  Radio Free Asia doesn’t exist,” he added.
