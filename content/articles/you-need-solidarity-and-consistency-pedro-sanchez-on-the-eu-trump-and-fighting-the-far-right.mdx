  fighting the far right

  When Pedro Sánchez and Keir Starmer meet in Downing Street on Wednesday it
  will be the first such bilateral summit between a Spanish prime minister and
  his British counterpart for more than a decade, an interregnum explained by
  Brexit and the now healed sore of Gibraltar. The absence of highest level
  diplomacy has become more glaring given the two men are the leading social
  democratic leaders of Europe, facing similar problems of migration, souring
  populist parties, the climate crisis and divisions over how to minimise the
  damage caused to the European global influence by Donald Trump’s erratic
  unilateralism. But in a Guardian interview with Sánchez in the prime
  minister’s office in Madrid, the contrasts, as much as the similarities, were
  on display in the political choices being made by the two leaders. In many
  ways, Sánchez, putting aside the corruption allegations that dog his family
  and former senior advisers, is the kind of socialist that many ordinary
  British Labour party members crave as they urge their leadership to move away
  from a political agenda determined by Reform that they fear Starmer can never
  win. Sometimes accused of not wielding Spain’s influence on the world stage –
  he was not invited to the recent European discussions with Trump – Sánchez
  showed a willingness to frame a values-based foreign policy that could
  transcend what he described as the transatlantic bond. On migration for
  instance Sánchez, faced by Vox, the rightwing populist party currently at 15%
  in the polls, will not apologise for saying migration is a necessary boon to
  the economy. “I am willing to explain the figures and how migration is helping
  to boost the economy and to increase our social spending. We have to do it
  with clear data in order to fight the populist approach,” he said. “In Spain
  migration represents 25% of our per capita GDP, 10% of our social security
  revenues and only 1% of our public expenditure.” Faced by accelerating
  population decline, western societies face a “dilemma between opening up and
  growing or closing off and shrinking”, he argued. Far from talking about
  Spanish people “feeling like strangers in their own land”, he confidently
  predicts “the vast majority of Spanish citizens understand quite well that
  migration is an opportunity and not just a moral duty”. One senses Sánchez
  regards the migration debate as less about identity and more about living
  standards and the economy, issues that will not be solved in Spain’s case
  without continued migration. Sánchez has also shown himself willing to air his
  differences with Trump without, he insists, intentionally weakening the
  transatlantic relationship. At the recent Nato summit in June, Spain was the
  only country that refused to sign up to Trump’s demand to reach a target of
  defence spending at 5% of GDP by 2035. Spain was a reliable Nato partner, he
  insisted, adding that in terms of capabilities Spain was meeting Nato
  commitments but the cost of reaching a target of 5% (Spain is just reaching
  2.1 %) was one he has not willing to bear. On one estimate, it would require
  Sánchez to increase defence spending by €80bn (£69bn) a year, a proposal he
  would never get through his coalition government. He claimed that, as Nato’s
  southern flank, Spain faced different security threats to northern Europe. At
  the summit, Trump responded to Spain’s refusal by threatening to double
  tariffs on Spain, saying he would personally oversee this negotiation and
  adding “the Spanish economy could be blown right out of the water”. But
  Sánchez said US tariffs are set for the whole of the EU and Spain cannot be
  singled out as a target. No punishment specific to Spain had been issued, he
  said. Nor did Trump’s lingering threat hold him back from criticising US
  global leadership in a way that Starmer has been reluctant to articulate
  explicitly. “The shocking reality is that what we are witnessing is that the
  principal architect of the international order, which is the US after the
  second world war, is now weakening that order and that is not something
  positive for the US society or Europe,” he said, highlighting US cuts to
  global aid and defending the role of the World Trade Organization. Sánchez has
  also led the way in Europe in criticising Israel’s actions in Gaza. In June,
  he directly accusing Israel of causing a genocidal situation, a verdict the UK
  government will not deliver, arguing only international courts can make such a
  judgment. Since spring last year, Sánchez has argued not only that European
  states should recognise Palestine as a state, but also that the EU should
  suspend its trade association agreement – again, something the UK has also
  refused to do. He says the divisions within Europe over the past 18 months
  means the EU efforts on Gaza represent “a failure, absolutely”, arguing that
  he can only try to persuade more EU states until there is a majority for
  suspension. What he describes as the “darkest episodes of international
  relations in the 21st century” leave him with no other option, but he says he
  will not cut off diplomatic relations with Israel since that would only lose
  him any remaining influence. The refusal to take concrete steps against Israel
  has damaged the west’s credibility with the global south, he says, and by
  displaying double standards weakened the cause of Ukraine. The perceived moral
  void being left by the west will be filled, he predicted. The new partnership
  between India, China and Russia on display this week in Beijing may mask
  ideological conflicts, but “in politics, as in life, there is always someone
  who is going to fill the gap you leave, and that is what we are witnessing
  when it comes to some east Asian countries”. But making an appeal to the
  global south on the biggest issues societies are facing, such as the climate
  crisis, was becoming harder owing to fissures in the west. After a summer of
  forest fires that in his view confirmed climate change was happening faster in
  Europe than the scientists predicted, he admits “the problem we are now facing
  is that there are traditional rightwing parties that perhaps don’t deny
  scientific reality, but they act and behave as if climate change does not
  exist”. The traditional right, he said, by turning the scientific evidence of
  climate change into a traditional ideological political struggle “are
  committing their biggest mistake”. “To combat climate change, you need
  resources, you need consistency, you need solidarity and you need a long term
  perspective, and unfortunately in politics nowadays we lack a bit of all
  that.” It is a depressing admission that in reality he could apply to all the
  dilemmas facing social democrats in government.
