  Among the serene lakes, thick forest and summer houses of North Karelia’s
  border zone, the line between Finland and Russia is almost invisible. Walking
  along the border path in Meriinaho, part of the Finnish border guard station
  of Ilomantsi, we are closer to St Petersburg than to Helsinki. This is the
  most easterly point of the continental European Union. Every now and then a
  discreet pair of matching striped fibreglass posts pop up from the blueberry
  patches on either side of the frontier. One is painted blue and white to
  indicate Finland, the other green and red to mark Russia. Despite generations
  of tensions and several wars, until recently these sparsely planted bollards –
  plus surveillance by Finnish and Russian border guards – were deemed
  sufficient to demarcate the neighbours. But the mood on both sides of the
  830-mile (1,340km) frontier, now also a critical Nato border, is changing
  fast. Last week as he sat down at the White House with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
  Donald Trump for talks on how to end the war in Ukraine, Finland’s president,
  Alexander Stubb, drew on the border to convey to the US president Europe’s
  collective concern. He told Trump: “We might come from a small country but we
  have a long border with Russia, over 800 miles. And we of course have our own
  historical experience with Russia, from world war two, the winter war and the
  war of continuation.” In an attempt to strike a note of optimism, he added:
  “We found a solution in 1944 and I’m sure that we will be able to find a
  solution in 2025.” But, away from best-case scenarios discussed in meeting
  rooms, that solution remains elusive. And in this corner of Europe the threat
  from the Kremlin is taken increasingly seriously. After his election last
  year, Stubb used his first trip as president to visit the border in North
  Karelia and to assert that “all measures must be taken” to keep the whole
  country inhabited. “We cannot afford to allow eastern Finland, northern
  Finland or any region in Finland to wither away,” he said. Moscow’s
  manoeuvring Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Finland has
  rapidly changed its positioning. It joined Nato at record speed and later made
  the drastic decision to indefinitely close its entire border with Russia,
  accusing Moscow of directing asylum seekers to Finland in a “hybrid
  operation”. It is now building sections of barrier fence along 120 miles of
  the border, aimed chiefly at stopping irregular migration. The Finnish defence
  forces have said they are closely watching Moscow’s manoeuvring amid reports
  that Russia has expanded its military bases near the Nato frontier. About 120
  miles east of Tohmajärvi, where the Guardian was among the first to visit
  North Karelia’s new barrier fence, Moscow has established a new 44th army
  corps to be headquartered in the city of Petrozavodsk. In June, the border
  force arrested a man crossing illegally into North Karelia whom Finnish media
  have since reported was a Russian Wagner defector. The border guard has not
  confirmed or denied that person’s alleged connections to the mercenary group.
  It has separately said it believes it has a person in one of its reception
  centres “with Wagner connections”. Matti Pitkäniitty, the commander of the
  North Karelia border guard district, believes illegal border crossings
  involving Russian defectors are likely to become a growing problem. Pointing
  to a gap in the vegetation where an old Finnish country lane passed through
  before the border was redrawn in 1940 after the Russo-Finnish war, resulting
  in Helsinki ceding part of Karelia, Pitkäniitty said most civilians trying to
  cross illegally preferred to stick to roads, limiting the number of potential
  routes. “People are afraid of those thick forests here,” he said. But this
  would not be an issue for a Russian military professional trying to flee the
  war in Ukraine. “Now, one of the risks we are facing are the military-trained
  personnel fleeing the war. They of course know how to navigate through the
  woods and how to survive there if they need to stay out of sight for a couple
  of days.” While it is known that people with military training have fled to
  the west, it is impossible to know exactly how many may have done so via the
  Finnish border. “This is not like the Berlin Wall where you have a really good
  perimeter. There are many more barriers here,” Pitkäniitty said. In addition
  to the restricted border zone, the border guard relies on technology such as
  sensors and drones, the natural deterrent of the terrain and the watchful eyes
  of locals. “So my basic assumption as a professional is that we don’t have a
  flawless system, there is a possibility that somebody has crossed it
  illegally, but not in large numbers.” The prospect of Russian men at the
  border coming from Ukraine, some of whom may have committed war crimes, was a
  “big threat” for Finland, Pitkäniitty said, and presented Finnish society –
  and European border authorities as a whole – with a difficult question. “How
  do we work with Russian males who have been in the war?” Guards in training
  North Karelia’s only road border crossing, Niirala, is now empty but there are
  still hints of different times, when the road was full of cars with Russian
  numberplates and North Karelia was a popular holiday destination. Road signs
  in Russian warn drivers to keep a safe distance from cars ahead. About once a
  week the crossing still gets a train from Russia carrying non-sanctioned
  essential goods such as fertiliser. Because of its geography, Finland has long
  been prepared for war with Russia. It is enshrined in the country’s
  constitution that every Finnish citizen is obliged to participate in national
  defence. All men aged 18 to 60 can be called upon for military service. Women
  are permitted to apply on a voluntary basis. Conscripts are called up in the
  year they turn 18 and, depending on their wishes and their fitness, training
  can last from 165 days to almost a year. In the forest near Joensuu, a city of
  77,000 people originally established by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia in 1848, the
  North Karelia border guard is training its latest batch of conscripts, who
  arrived this summer. After several days living in low-lying tents and learning
  survival skills, the group, dressed in camouflage with painted faces, are
  practising moving through the forest in formation, shooting blanks through the
  trees. The vast majority of the group are male, but Emma, 19, has put herself
  forward to do the training. “I think it is important to support your own
  country,” she said. “I don’t know if I want to do something like this as a
  career, but it’s a good opportunity for women. I think everyone should join.”
  Despite North Karelia’s position on one of the highest-stakes geopolitical
  faultlines, cross-border interrelations continue to some extent. The North
  Karelian border guards cooperate with their Russian colleagues, who are under
  the jurisdiction of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), on practical
  issues such as trees falling on the border and forest fires, but not to the
  extent they did before the invasion of Ukraine. Pitkäniitty used to have 10
  meetings a year with his Russian counterpart, communicating via an
  interpreter; now he has four. Finland’s Nato membership has significantly
  changed the dynamic. “For Russians, Nato has been historically next to Satan,
  if not Satan itself. So now we are part of that and it changes how they view
  the Finns,” Pitkäniitty said. Before the war in Ukraine, he used to joke that
  “safe” topics to talk about with the Russians included hunting, fishing,
  berries and mushrooms and sport. Now, with Russia excluded from sporting
  competitions, one of those has been struck from the list. But, he added, “you
  can still talk about fishing, hunting and mushrooms”.
