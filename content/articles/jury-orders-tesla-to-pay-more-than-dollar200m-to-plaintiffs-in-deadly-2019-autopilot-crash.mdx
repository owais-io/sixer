  A Florida jury ordered Tesla to pay more than $200m to victims of a deadly
  crash involving its Autopilot driver assist technology. Friday’s verdict is a
  hit for Elon Musk’s car company, as it opens the door to other costly lawsuits
  and could potentially strike a blow to Tesla’s reputation for safety at a
  critical time for the company. And the decision has been closely eyed by other
  car companies, as they work to develop cars that increasingly drive
  themselves. The federal jury in Miami held that Tesla bore significant
  responsibility for the crash because its technology failed and that not all
  the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was
  distracted by his cellphone before hitting a young couple out gazing at the
  stars. The decision comes as Musk seeks to convince Americans his cars are
  safe enough to drive on their own as he plans to roll out a driverless taxi
  service in several cities in the coming months. The ruling ends a
  four-year-long case remarkable not just in its outcome, but in the fact that
  it even made it to trial. Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed
  and, when that didn’t happen, the company settled to avoid the spotlight of a
  trial. “This will open the floodgates,” Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer
  not involved in the Tesla case told the Associated Press. “It will embolden a
  lot of people to come to court.” The jury found that Tesla was 33% responsible
  for the crash that led to the death of 22-year-old Benavides Leon and injured
  her boyfriend, Angulo. The rest of the blame was placed on the driver, George
  Brian McGee. The jury ordered $129m in compensatory damages, of which Tesla
  will have to pay 33%, and $200m in punitive damages, to the estate of
  Benavides Leon and to Angulo. In his closing statements, Brett Schreiber, who
  represented the plaintiffs, accused Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of
  its Autopilot technology and said that the company knew the autopilot function
  increased the likelihood its drivers would be distracted, according to the
  Washington Post. “The car they claimed to have invented didn’t exist,”
  Schreiber said during closing arguments on Thursday. “They knew all along that
  the Autopilot was defective.” “I trusted the technology too much,” McGee, the
  driver, said at one point in his testimony. “I believed that if the car saw
  something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.”
  Lawyers for Tesla argued in court that no car could have prevented the crash
  because the driver had been “reckless” and “aggressive”, according to the New
  York Times. Schreiber acknowledged that McGee was negligent when he blew
  through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62mph before
  slamming into a Chevrolet Tahoe that the couple had parked to get a look at
  the stars. The Tahoe spun around so hard it was able to launch Benavides 75ft
  through the air into nearby woods where her body was later found. It also left
  Angulo, who walked into the courtroom on Friday with a limp and cushion to sit
  on, with broken bones and a traumatic brain injury. The case also included
  startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased and Angulo. They
  claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video
  recorded seconds before the accident. Tesla has previously faced criticism
  that it is slow to produce crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla
  crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the
  plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated
  denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. Tesla said it made a
  mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly had not thought it was
  there. Tesla said it would appeal the verdict. “Today’s verdict is wrong and
  only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire
  industry’s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,” the
  company said in a statement. In its statement, Tesla said it was only
  responsible for 33% of the compensatory damages (so approximately $42.5m), and
  any punitive damages would be capped at three times that amount, at most. “To
  be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash,”
  the company said. The verdict may place a damper on the company’s ambitions to
  launch a driverless car-sharing service across the US. Musk has made several
  ambitious pronouncements about when the Robotaxi service will be available to
  Americans. Most recently, on Tesla’s earnings call, Tesla’s CEO said that he
  expected the car-sharing service to be available to half the US population by
  the end of this year. Already, Tesla has launched tests of the Robotaxi
  service in Austin and San Francisco. In the test phase, the cars still require
  a driver in the vehicle. • This article was amended on 1 August 2025 because
  Tesla will have to pay $240m to the estate of Benavides Leon and to Angulo,
  not $329m as an earlier version said.
