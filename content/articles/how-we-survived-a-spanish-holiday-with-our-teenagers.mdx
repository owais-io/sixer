  They’ve packed too much, surely? The cabin crew do not look thrilled as I try
  to help squeeze each bag into the overhead lockers or the footwells under the
  seats in front. My 19-year-old has brought five and a half bikinis – we are
  away for a week – and her sister, four. (For comparison, I’ve taken my one and
  only pair of trunks.) The 19-year-old’s boyfriend has mercifully adopted a
  more minimal approach – just one wheelie for him – while the 17-year-old’s
  best friend has a different outfit for every day. If there is an unusual sense
  of excitement among us right now, then it’s because of the extra human baggage
  in tow. The fact that each daughter has been permitted a plus-one on our
  family summer holiday this year means that we can still be together, but
  mostly apart. It’s how they like it these days. It happened slowly at first,
  and then all at once. We had previously been a tight family of four who
  enjoyed each other’s company and loved going abroad. But then the girls grew
  fully into their Kevin and Perry years, and abruptly our holidays became
  protracted affairs, pierced by arguments, sulking and occasional stormings
  off, my wife’s attempts at diplomacy mostly failing. One daughter wanted the
  beach, the other the swimming pool, and then both decided they would much
  rather just stay in bed all day. Their phones made everything so much worse. I
  was ready to give up on such holidays altogether, but my wife persisted. Our
  last attempt was two years ago. I recall one particular evening in Skiathos,
  when the then 17-year-old announced she was craving cocktails, so we went to a
  bar filled with young people and bought three full-powered ones and a
  non-alcoholic equivalent for the 15-year-old. The gesture failed. We sat in
  silence as my daughter fumed at our very presence (me in sandals), and I
  reeled at the €50 bar bill. Each of us by now wanted different things from our
  time away. There was bickering over breakfast options and wifi reliability,
  while my wife maintained the conviction that any loose collection of bricks
  upon the island – which she quaintly termed “historical ruins” – was worth a
  30-minute trek in 32C heat to go visit. All I wanted to do was sit in a cafe
  with a sea view and read my book. Which is why this summer we said yes to them
  bringing guests. Add to the soup to dilute the soup. We’re in southern Spain.
  Here, the 19-year-old wants only to tan, the 17-year-old to swim in the pool.
  The boyfriend wants a football to kick, while the friend wants to have “fun”.
  “Relax,” my wife tells me. “It’ll be fine.” We arrive in Seville to thick heat
  and cicadas, and an immediate atmosphere of crop tops and flip-flops. Our hire
  car is enormous, a seven-seater, which the teens fill with pale, sprawled
  limbs. They are asleep within seconds of us hitting the motorway. It’s two
  hours to Cádiz, and I keep turning to look at them, to make sure they’re OK,
  these people we’re required to keep alive for the next seven days. When our
  daughters were younger, we would routinely meet their friends’ mothers and
  fathers, but all this stopped the moment they reached secondary school, when
  it became paramount to keep parents hidden over fears of public embarrassment.
  And so these are the children of strangers, essentially. The weight of
  responsibility hangs heavy. Whenever we go away, the dog-sitter sends us
  photographs of the dog, presumably to show us that she is safe and well.
  Should we be doing the same here for the kids’ parents, and have them holding
  up today’s newspaper to confirm the date? “I’ll deal with it,” my wife says, a
  woman with more numbers in her phone book than I have in mine. We are staying
  in the small coastal town of Zahara de los Atunes, famed locally for its tuna,
  and where Spanish tourists appear to outnumber Brits by 99 to one. It is close
  to midnight when we arrive. The air-con is complicated, and the bedroom fans
  appear stricken with seizures. I’m exhausted, but the children experience a
  second wind. They want to go into town, which is a 20-minute walk or five
  minutes in the car. One of us will have to take them. We toss for it. My wife
  loses. Each morning, we awake to a mausoleum silence as they sleep off the
  effects of the night before. There are leftovers from their post-midnight
  snacks on the kitchen table, alongside the dregs of sticky alcoholic drinks,
  which the ants have found and are now busy informing all their friends about.
  My wife and I enjoy a quiet breakfast on the balcony, then pad early to the
  beach before the winds pick up. (By afternoon, the wind here, known as the
  levante, is strong enough to lift you from your towel and carry you across the
  Strait of Gibraltar before depositing you in Morocco.) We check our phones
  repeatedly for signs that the young ones have woken. When they do rouse, gone
  midday, they send us a list of requirements from the supermarket: chips and
  Haribo and Bacardi. We buy them fresh ingredients for summer salads instead.
  All of us revert helplessly to type. We nag them about sunscreen and riptides,
  and make sure they know where the calamine lotion is. They sigh and mutter
  “yes, yes” and then ignore everything. We encourage them to drink plenty of
  water, and we navigate the minor squabbles that arise with nothing like
  aplomb. (It is too hot for aplomb.) My wife suggests excursions, the usual
  tourist preoccupations: souvenir shops, a museum, one of those churches with
  the nice stained windows. But none of them seem much fussed. They want rum. I,
  meanwhile, have the latest Sally Rooney and 800 pages of Helen Garner’s
  diaries to get through. We do occasionally come together as a group, like
  normal people. One day, we drive an hour to Cádiz, its picturesque old town
  full of narrow streets and a vibrant food market. We eat tapas and drink wine,
  and the plus-ones listen patiently while we tell silly family stories in the
  way that all families do – and, as with all families, probably reveal
  ourselves as eccentric at best, or else certifiably mad. But they tolerate us,
  the plus-ones, and that’s the main thing. It’s a lovely evening. There’s a
  curious anticipation in the air when the time comes to go home. My wife and I
  are staying on for a few more days to explore the region in a smaller hire
  car, while the kids are returning for August jobs to help fund college and
  university. At the departure gate, I surprise myself by crying. All four of
  them look so beautiful and tanned, glowing with youth and vitality, their
  wrists full of friendship bracelets. I watch them stride away, specifically
  towards customs but also on into adulthood, without us, and I am overcome with
  emotion and love. I want them to come back, to extend the family holiday,
  because I’m not ready to consign it to the past, not just yet. But I know,
  too, that this is life; that it’s wise to let them go, be free. “Safe flight,”
  I cry out to them, a little too loudly. “Please remember to text when you
  land. Call me!”
