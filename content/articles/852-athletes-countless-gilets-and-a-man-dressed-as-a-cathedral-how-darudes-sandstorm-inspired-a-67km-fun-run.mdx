  It’s 3.45pm on a Sunday in Helsinki’s Kaivopuisto park and I’m warming-up near
  a man dressed as the city’s cathedral. A headdress of neoclassical domes sets
  the outfit off, but it’s the Senate Square cathedral steps that have won him
  the best outfit award at the inaugural Darude Sandstorm Run. For Daniel
  Erickson, who has travelled from New York especially, it’s well-deserved. The
  Darude Sandstorm Run is a suitably silly marker of 25 years of both Finnish DJ
  Darude’s career and the release of the music video for Sandstorm. First
  released in Finland in 1999, the track is a trance earworm notable for its
  du-du-du-du-du riff, as if being emitted from some futuristic pan pipes. It
  went global the following year, along with a semi-iconic music video shot in
  Helsinki, viewed 306m times on YouTube. I, Erickson and 825 others are now
  gearing up to run the route documented in its cops-and-robbers storyline.
  Sandstorm remains a staple of sporting events, is loved by sports stars –
  swimmer Michael Phelps used to listen to it before winning Olympic gold
  medals, citing the energy it gave him – and has found a constantly evolving
  place in internet culture, making it a platinum-seller in the UK and the US.
  Whether somebody is playing it on a potato or it’s being used as the sound for
  a sandstorm alarm in the Gobi Desert, it’s one of Finland’s most recognisable
  pop culture exports. The track has taken Darude, real name Toni-Ville Henrik
  Virtanen, around the world, playing live in over 80 countries including recent
  stops in Japan and Guyana. Speaking from Chicago a week prior to the run, he
  looks back fondly at the support Sandstorm received in the UK from DJs Pete
  Tong and Judge Jules. It then went to No 3 in the charts. But, he says, “my
  last five or 10 years of relevancy I definitely owe to gaming and the meme
  culture that revolves around that.” The track is particularly popular with
  players of online multiplayer battle arena game League of Legends; “Darude –
  Sandstorm” is now a stock response to anyone requesting a track ID on gaming
  streams. Beyond the track’s infernal catchiness, it’s not clear why Sandstorm
  took off as a soundtrack of choice among Call of Duty streamers in the late
  00s, but its use snowballed as internet culture developed and the US EDM boom
  hit. YouTube putting a Darude button on its player for April Fools’ Day in
  2015, which added a second of Sandstorm to any video on its site, cemented its
  meme legacy. I get the sense Darude is conflicted by his song’s strange
  legacy: “My crowd has gotten younger, which is obviously key to my ongoing
  career,” he says pragmatically. “But also, I’ve met people in their 40s or 50s
  at my shows with their 18-year-old kids. It’s really cool when someone young
  comes over and says: ‘I was five or six when my mom and dad played your stuff
  in the car. Now I’m here.’” Back in Helsinki, people from 17 countries have
  amassed for our 6.7km run. We are encouraged to take pictures matching images
  from a free locations booklet along the way and Darude has curated a special
  playlist for the event on Spotify (spoiler: it’s Sandstorm on repeat). Some
  runners are clad in gilets and carrying silver briefcases in honour of the
  video. There is a brief moment 30 seconds after the start where I think I
  could possibly win, but then the downhill past the Kaivopuisto fence makes way
  for the slightest of climbs and my pace drops to a painful crawl across the
  city’s cobbled streets. I try to picture a young Darude along the way, clad in
  those wraparound glasses, doing that crouched pose. “I had very little to do
  with the music video, but it was an awesome experience,” Darude tells me,
  adding that director Juuso Syrjä would go on to direct various Nordic noir
  shows, including Netflix’s Border Town. “There were so many cool people that
  pulled together for the video and the follow-up ones, and so many of us had
  actual careers come out of it.” He has the air of a man who’d quite like to be
  known for more than one hit, but who has also made his peace with the fact
  that he probably won’t be. “Sandstorm has life of its own, and it’s bigger
  than me,” he says. “But if people know Sandstorm, I just hope they come and
  see me live somewhere. I can show them what I do. I’m there partying with them
  – that’s when I’m at my happiest.” Back at the park I arrive very much not in
  first place at a rapturous finish line, soundtracked by Darude himself on the
  decks, selflessly lifting, dropping and remixing the track for an entire hour
  so that everyone can experience their own unique piece of Sandstorm history. A
  queue forms for merch signing and one by one Darude politely signs everything
  given to him. “Let’s have a break from the dududus,” he says to the crowd,
  thanking them for coming before playing some music that isn’t Sandstorm. •
