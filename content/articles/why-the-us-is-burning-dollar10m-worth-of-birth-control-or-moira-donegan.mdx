  There are few better metaphors for the receding status of American women than
  one offered up by the Trump administration at a medical waste disposal
  facility outside Paris this week: rather than distribute nearly $10m worth of
  birth control, which had been purchased by USAID and was destined to be given
  to women in low-income countries, primarily in Africa, the Americans decided
  to burn it. The incinerated contraceptives included 900,000 birth control
  implants, 2m doses of injectable long-acting birth control, 2m packs of
  contraceptive pills and 50,000 IUDs. The medicine is just the latest in the
  far-reaching fallout from cuts made by the so-called “department of government
  efficiency,” or Doge, a project in which Elon Musk and a group of his very
  young, overwhelmingly male acolytes unilaterally slashed congressionally
  appropriated funding to government programs they did not like. The cuts have
  been devastating for non-profits that work to improve women’s health and
  safety worldwide. Sarah Shaw, an associate director at the global family
  planning group MSI Reproductive Choices, says that the cuts will put women at
  risk as they strain their health with unplanned pregnancies and seek out
  illegal abortions; other women who are denied access to birth control will
  lose out on the opportunities for education, professional development or
  remunerative work that can help them escape abuse, rise out of poverty, pursue
  their talents and ambitions and better provide for the children they already
  have. When MSI attempted to buy the contraceptives, the administration would
  only accept full price, which the organization couldn’t afford, she said.
  Several non-profits, including MSI, had offered to pay to ship and repackage
  the supplies, according to another representative. But the Trump
  administration refused, partially due to federal rules the prohibit the US
  from providing such goods to groups that perform, provide referrals for or
  offer education about abortions. In addition to the cost of purchasing the
  contraceptives, American taxpayers will now be on the hook for about $167,000
  for the cost of burning them. It’s just the latest in a series of signs that
  the Trump administration is turning against the provision of birth control,
  particularly the safe, effective and woman-controlled hormonal methods that
  have been a cornerstone of healthcare policy for decades and which were a
  precondition of women’s advancement in work and education over the past 60
  years. In April, the Trump administration abruptly announced that it was
  suspending a large swath of the domestic service grants distributed under
  Title X, the program meant to help low-income Americans access birth control,
  STD treatment and other sexual and reproductive healthcare. Of the 86 Title X
  grants awarded for fiscal year 2024, nearly 25% were “temporarily withheld”,
  mostly based on highly suspect allegations that the grant-receiving
  institutions – including 13 Planned Parenthood affiliates – had failed to
  comply with Trump executive orders banning things like DEI programs. Eight
  states now receive zero Title X dollars: California, Hawaii, Maine, Missouri,
  Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee and Utah. Alaska, Minnesota and Pennsylvania
  have also lost most of their contraception funding. The domestic cuts – along
  with the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from Medicaid reimbursements
  – mean that American women, too, are now facing dramatically greater obstacles
  to accessing birth control. Clinics that relied on Title X funding are now set
  to close: 11 Planned Parenthood clinics already have, including in
  Democratically controlled states like California. Planned Parenthood says that
  cumulatively, the cuts could lead the organization to close about 200 of its
  600 clinics nationwide – a devastating cut to abortion providers in particular
  that will make a wide range of reproductive services inaccessible to women
  regardless of where they live. But the Trump administration is not merely
  forcing these programs for women’s health and dignity go up in flames. They
  are redirecting them to better suit their preferred cultural outcome: one in
  which women’s lives, ambitions and talents are all subordinated to the task of
  childbearing. The New York Times reported last month that the White House is
  redirecting Title X funds that once went to birth control to instead fund an
  “infertility training center” and programs in something called “restorative
  reproductive medicine”. If Title X’s original aim was to help American women
  control their fertility so as to build healthier families and to enable them
  to pursue other aims – like learning or work – in the new administration’s
  version, the program exists mainly to encourage women to have more children.
  But the switch should not be seen as a genuine investment in infertility, an
  often devastating condition with which many Americans struggle. Because the
  new Title X priorities do not, by and large, direct more money to IVF. Trump
  promised, on the campaign trail, to make IVF free. But the procedure, which
  has opponents on the Christian right, is not included in the administration’s
  new priority of “restorative” reproductive medicine, a practice that avoids
  controversial fertility treatments; instead, doctors seek the “root cause” of
  a woman’s infertility, which may involve telling them they can conceive with
  proper diet and exercise. In government, money allocation is a statement of
  values. With its dramatic cuts to contraceptive funding at home and abroad,
  the Trump administration is making its values clear. It does not value women’s
  health; it does not value their dignity, their control over their own lives,
  their aspirations, their earning potential, their desire to be freed from
  ignorance, or poverty, or the abuse they suffer under the hands of husbands
  and fathers. It does not value their ability to control their own bodies, and
  by extension, it does not value their ability to enter the public sphere. It
  does not value their dreams, their gifts, their hard work or invention or
  aspiration to anything other than making babies. American women, like women
  everywhere, depend on birth control to live lives of freedom and to pursue
  their dreams. But because of the Trump administration, those dreams are going
  up in smoke. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist
