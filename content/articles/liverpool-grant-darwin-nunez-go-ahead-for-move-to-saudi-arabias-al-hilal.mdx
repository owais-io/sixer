  Liverpool have given Darwin Núñez permission to negotiate a move to the Saudi
  Pro League, with Al‑Hilal close to finalising a fee for the Uruguay
  international. They remain in discussion over a deal for the 26-year-old, who
  started eight Premier League games last season, but an agreement is expected
  to be reached quickly providing Núñez is open to the transfer. Milan and
  Napoli were interested in taking the centre-forward, but were deterred by the
  finances involved. Liverpool paid an initial £64m to sign Núñez from Benfica
  in 2022, with add-ons taking the deal to a potential club-record £85m at the
  time, and have been looking to recoup about £60m. The Premier League champions
  rejected a bid of about £60m from Al‑Nassr in January as they prioritised
  winning the title over cashing in on a player who has struggled to adapt to
  Arne Slot’s system. Al‑Hilal’s offer is for an initial £46m, plus add‑ons,
  although the final structure has yet to be agreed. Núñez would be a statement
  signing for Al-Hilal, as a high‑profile forward in the prime of his career.
  The squad are at a training camp in Germany and Núñez could meet Al‑Hilal
  officials there. He will remain part of plans for the Community Shield against
  Crystal Palace on Sunday if he is not sold. A deal for Núñez would take
  Liverpool’s income from player sales past £250m since Richard Hughes started
  as sporting director last summer. The club sold Tyler Morton to Lyon for £15m
  on Tuesday and could also sell Harvey Elliott and Federico Chiesa. Leipzig are
  considering a move for Elliott should Xavi Simons join Chelsea and Chiesa
  could return to Italy. Liverpool have invested almost £300m on players this
  summer and their £110m bid for the Newcastle striker Alexander Isak remains on
  the table.
