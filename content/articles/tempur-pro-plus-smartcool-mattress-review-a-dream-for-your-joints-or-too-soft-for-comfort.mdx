  for comfort?

  Let’s get the Nasa thing out of the way first. Memory foam, so the internet
  tells me, repeatedly, was developed by the US space agency in the 60s to
  cushion astronauts during flights. Nice story, but there’s no extreme G-force
  in my bed, just a pair of middle-aged people wanting to sleep. Do we really
  need Nasa’s pricey wonder material for that? It does help, in small doses.
  I’ve found that a layer or two of memory foam can turn a good mattress into a
  great one. This soft, cosy material moulds to your body and does a brilliant
  job of tempering the solidity of springs in hybrid mattresses, such as the
  Simba Hybrid Pro and Otty Original Hybrid. It also absorbs bounce so well that
  it’s helped me and my husband sleep in peace despite each other’s fidgeting. A
  mattress made entirely from memory foam, though? I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy lying
  on 25cm of chewy marshmallow. Mercifully, Tempur uses foam of many different
  firmness levels, including high-density base layers designed to provide
  support as strong as springs. I set out to discover how well it works by
  testing one of Tempur’s most popular mattresses, the Pro Plus SmartCool. View
  at Tempur View at Bensons for Beds *** How I tested Tempur sent me a
  double-size Pro Plus SmartCool for sleep-testing in July. It was the best of
  times and the worst of times to test this mattress, because my bedroom was
  stifling. I was sent a medium mattress instead of the requested medium-firm,
  and this was unfortunate because heat can make memory foam even softer – and I
  find firmer mattresses more comfortable. At least the balmy conditions were
  perfect for testing the claimed cooling properties of the SmartCool fabric
  cover. Before any snoozing could take place, my husband, Alan, and I ran our
  usual mattress-testing experiments. Memory foam tends to trap heat, so we were
  keen to see if the SmartCool cover could offset this. We used a heat pad, a
  thermocouple and our bottoms to measure how efficiently the surface cooled
  down, and we also took the temperature of the foam beneath. We then deployed
  weights and wobbly cups of water to measure factors such as sinkage, motion
  isolation and edge support. Our family testing panel came over to score the
  mattress out of 10 on firmness, breathability and comfort. I prefer to
  sleep-test mattresses for much longer than a week because even the firmest
  cushioning materials soften over time. The Simba and Panda Hybrid Bamboo felt
  significantly softer after a couple of months. The Tempur was soft from the
  start, though, and Alan and I found it too cushioned for comfort. After a week
  of poor sleep, we gave it to my dad, Don, 85, to see if its pressure relief
  might help soothe the joint pain he’s been suffering in his hip and shoulder
  (more on which below). He returned it to us for a second leg of sleep testing
  once temperatures had cooled down in late July. *** What you need to know,
  from price to firmness View at Tempur View at Bensons for Beds Tempur, founded
  in the US in 1992, was among the first brands to make mattresses from
  viscoelastic polyurethane foam. “Memory foam” is how you know this stuff, but
  Tempur calls it “Tempur Material” and uses its own proprietary formulas that
  cover a range of densities. Memory foam moulds to your body and doesn’t spring
  back quickly when pressed. It feels quite different from the simple
  seat-cushion polyfoam used in many sprung mattresses under the sleep surface
  (in the Ikea Valevåg, for example). It’s also more expensive. And so, as with
  many mattresses that contain high proportions of memory foam, Tempur
  mattresses are expensive. The Pro Plus SmartCool sits in the middle of
  Tempur’s range, costing from £1,499 for a 21cm-deep single to £4,299 for a
  30cm-deep 200 x 200cm (“special size”). The 25cm-deep double I tested costs
  from £2,299, almost twice the price of the Simba, the next most expensive
  mattress in the Filter’s roundup. The medium SmartCool has four layers of
  foam, of varying densities: a 5cm upper layer of soft, elastic memory foam for
  cushioning and pressure relief; then 5cm of adaptive foam; and then 3cm of
  even denser supportive foam. Finally, the 12cm “DuraBase” layer of even denser
  foam provides support and durability. Everyone on my panel rated it 5/10 on
  the soft-firm scale, so the “medium” description is accurate. The sleeping
  surface sank a generous 4.2cm under 7.5kg of hand weights. That’s well
  cushioned, but only marginally more than the Eve Wunderflip Hybrid, which sank
  4cm and is described as medium-firm. Tempur doesn’t say how the SmartCool’s
  “QuickRefresh” polyester fabric cover dissipates heat; it simply cites
  “cool-to-the-touch” technology. The cover unzips easily with its stylish green
  handles, and it can be washed at 40C. You can also unzip and wash the base
  cover. Trying to wash or sponge the mattress inside, however, will invalidate
  your guarantee. The double-size mattress weighs a chunky 40kg, a few kilos
  more than the Otty or the Simba, but much less than the 65kg Millbrook Wool
  Luxury 4000. The Tempur’s weight and floppiness – plus the absence of any
  turning handles – make it tricky to manoeuvre, but once you’ve got it on your
  bed, you’ll never really have to. You don’t have to turn it, although you can
  rotate it occasionally to maintain even support, according to the care
  guidelines. Tempur has several showrooms where you can try its mattresses
  before buying, although you’ll need to make an appointment. Locations include
  Castleford in West Yorkshire, Bridgend, Swindon, Milton Keynes, Durham and
  both Westfields in London. Whether you buy in person or online, you get a
  10-year warranty and a 100-night trial. *** Specifications Type: memory foam

  Old mattress recycling: not offered in UK Sustainability credentials: Oeko-Tex
  Standard 100 certified; Pro mattresses are Danish Indoor Climate labelled; UK
  warehouse operations are zero landfill; Tempur aims to be carbon neutral by
  2040 *** Delivery You wait years for a mattress to turn up without being
  vacuum-shrunk, then they all come at once. As with the Millbrook Wool Luxury
  4000, the Tempur arrived full-size and flat. That meant it was ready to sleep
  on immediately, unlike the oodles of bed-in-a-box mattresses I’ve tested, and
  it came packed in significantly less plastic wrapping than they did. The
  downside of receiving a non-shrunk mattress is that it’s harder to get it up
  the stairs. Tempur’s helpful delivery team would have done it for me, but I
  wanted to see how my husband and I coped (sorry, Alan). The Tempur-branded
  delivery team was nice to see after so many third-party couriers, but I had to
  wait three weeks for the mattress to arrive. New foam often has a chemical
  “off-gassing” smell, and the Tempur is quite stinky (or fragrant, depending on
  your preferences) for its first couple of weeks. I don’t mind the smell, but
  you may find it distracting, especially when you’re trying to get to sleep.
  *** What we love None like it hot when they’re trying to sleep, so I was
  delighted by the genuinely fresh feel of Tempur’s SmartCool cover. Iggy the
  cat was particularly keen to hog the stitched fabric when July’s night-time
  temperatures exceeded 20C, perhaps because his 4kg body couldn’t sink into the
  heat-trapping memory foam. Our bodies did sink into it, however. As we slept,
  the foam formed a cocoon around us (mainly our bums), and made us feel like we
  were floating in the mattress rather than on top of it. There was no sense of
  sagging, just of strong, deliberate cradling. Firmer mattresses are more to my
  taste, but they can give me niggling pain from an old rib injury, and the
  Tempur never did. If you live with pain and find it hard to sleep as a result,
  the memory foam upper layers of this mattress could be just what you need. My
  85-year-old dad, Don, also enjoyed the pain relief of the mattress but has
  since switched back to the firmer surface to which he’s more accustomed. He
  first tried it lying on his back and said: “Oh, I like that … I think,” which
  echoed my own thoughts. I asked him to turn on to his right side to test his
  recently injured shoulder and hip, and he said there was no pain – a welcome
  relief for us both. The mattress’s motion isolation is exceptionally good.
  This is something I’ve learned to expect from highly cushioned memory foam
  because it absorbs the movement of your body and dramatically cuts down on
  bounce. Alan and I are fidgety sleepers, so motion isolation helps us rest
  without being disturbed by each other. *** What we don’t love As mentioned,
  some of the higher-density layers of Tempur’s mattress are decidedly firm. The
  Pro Plus SmartCool is also available in two firmer versions than the one I
  tested. But the medium version quickly turned out to be an over-enthusiastic
  hugger, at least for our tastes. After the initially pleasurable cradling, it
  just kept going until it seemed to be swallowing us. “My bum is disappearing
  into it,” said Don. He and I are very small, so we didn’t sink as far into
  this mattress as a person of larger build would. My husband, Alan, thoroughly
  average size, sank too far for comfort and declared it “like being sucked into
  quicksand”. We wanted to give the Tempur a fair chance, so we used it on our
  slatted bed base for several nights, then Don used it on his solid divan base.
  It never felt lumpy or saggy, but my lower back felt unsupported, and our
  sleeping bodies made impressions so deep that it became difficult to roll
  over. If your sleep style involves plenty of tossing and turning, a firmer
  mattress will suit you better. Edge support is frankly poor for a mattress
  that costs this much. Even a soft mattress should have some firm reinforcement
  around the sides to make it easy to get into and out, but when we tried
  sitting on the edge, we all felt like we were sliding off it. Sitting up to
  read is difficult because your weight is concentrated on your bum, and you
  just, well, sink. Even the cover’s cooling ability had its limits, as Alan and
  I discovered when sinking into the foam beneath it. We woke in the night,
  complaining that we felt we were cooking in the heat of our sleeping bodies.
  The cover helps by forming a barrier between you and the foam, but we found –
  in our experience and our heat-retention tests – that it couldn’t stop the
  foam getting hotter than a mattress that contains springs. If you tend to
  overheat at night all year round, an all-foam mattress isn’t for you. ***
  Sustainability Environmental kudos is a challenge for a company that uses this
  much foam. High-viscosity polyurethane foam is non-biodegradable, has a
  chemical-intensive manufacturing process and is harder to recycle than fabric
  or springs. Given all this, Tempur has made decent strides in sustainability.
  The most noticeable example for me was the dramatic reduction in plastic
  packaging compared with bed-in-a-box mattresses. There isn’t even any
  cardboard to get rid of. Behind the scenes, Tempur’s products are Oeko-Tex
  Standard 100-certified, and its Danish production facility is ISO-certified
  for quality, environment, health and safety, and energy. Tempur mattresses are
  made in Denmark, and its Pro and One mattresses are certified by the Danish
  Indoor Climate Labelling scheme, a voluntary but internationally recognised
  standard for chemical compound emissions. Tempur’s UK warehouses and
  distribution centres have been zero landfill since 2019, and the company aims
  to be carbon neutral by 2040. Foam isn’t easy to recycle, but Tempur offers
  ideas on its environmental sustainability page. Old foam “can be cleaned and
  shredded for use in new products, such as carpet underlay”, it says, so I’m
  disappointed that the company doesn’t offer to do this with its UK customers’
  old mattresses. Mattress collection is offered in the US “on request”, but not
  here. Tempur UK does at least run an online outlet store where you can buy
  refurbished products, including mattresses that have been returned by buyers
  within the 100-night trial. *** Tempur Pro Plus SmartCool: should I buy it?
  The medium version of the Pro Plus SmartCool is a soft, cradling mattress with
  excellent pressure relief. If you love your beds on the plush side, you may
  decide it’s worth every penny. However, this sumptuous mattress is not for
  everyone – including my family and me. Perhaps the quicksand sensation was too
  close to our childhood nightmares to give us the sleep of our dreams. View at
