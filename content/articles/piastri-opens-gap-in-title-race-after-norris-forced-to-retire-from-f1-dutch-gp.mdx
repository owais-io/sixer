  For a weekend that opened with such high hopes of fresh starts and title
  charges, the Dutch Grand Prix could not, for some, have borne more bitter
  fruit. Oscar Piastri did take a dominant win but his teammate and title rival
  Lando Norris was left head bowed, disconsolate, alone in the blustery dunes
  beside the North Sea. Similarly, the seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was
  forced to trudge back to the paddock, his Ferrari in pieces by the side of the
  track after an enormously uncharacteristic, unforced error. This was sport as
  a cruel mistress writ large at Zandvoort. Piastri’s performance was as
  admirable and assured as any he had delivered, the 24‑year‑old Australian as
  unflappable as ever to deliver a consummate pole‑to‑flag victory. Indeed it
  never looked in doubt from the moment he held his lead through turn one, even
  through a brief period of light rain and three safety-car restarts. But in his
  wake fate had decreed the most damnable fortune for Norris. The British driver
  had entered the weekend fired up for the title run‑in, with just nine points
  between the two protagonists. He had noted that now it was getting serious,
  with nine races to go after the meeting in Zandvoort, every point would
  matter. Dropping a few he might consider a setback but a DNF to his teammate’s
  victory was surely the veritable white whale of Norris’s nightmares. Worse
  still was the manner he was denied. In the turbo-hybrid era the cars have
  become all but bulletproof in reliability, the days of an engine going pop
  seemingly all but long gone. Yet as Norris harried Piastri to the flag in
  second place, with only seven laps to go, the unthinkable became blunt reality
  as his cockpit filled with smoke that belched from the car as the oil leak
  that was to blame finally ground him to a halt. Norris pulled over, climbed
  out and moved, dejected, to sit alone on the dunes, helmet on and head bowed,
  sitting disconsolate as his hopes fell to pieces – through no fault of his
  own. Nonetheless Norris, impressively, took it with no little phlegm,
  remaining calm and remarkably stoic on reflection. “It wasn’t my fault, so
  there’s nothing I can really do. It’s just not my weekend,” he said. “Of
  course it’s frustrating. It hurts a bit for sure in a championship point of
  view. It’s a lot of points to lose so quickly and so easily.” Piastri, as cool
  as ever, calmly took the flag with complete control to secure a 34-point lead
  in the drivers’ championship. Not insurmountable but a swing that amounts to a
  body blow for the British driver and one from which he must recover for Monza
  in a week’s time. Hamilton has a similarly short time to reset after what was
  supposed to have been his fresh start in the wake of the summer break after a
  difficult first half of the season on his debut with Ferrari. Last week he
  said he was determined to have fun driving again, to enjoy himself competing
  for the team he had dreamed of joining when he was child, and that he felt
  positive and motivated. His hopes were left in tatters in a shower of carbon
  fibre as the front of his Ferrari came apart on impact with the barriers. With
  very light rain intensifying a little on lap 21, Hamilton was caught out. At
  turn three he went wide on to part of the track beyond the white line where
  painted branding adorns the tarmac. With a fine coating of Dutch drizzle it
  was a slippery surface and he lost the rear and slid inexorably off into the
  barriers. “I’m so sorry guys,” he said as, clearly dejected, he made his way
  on foot back to the paddock, helmet still firmly on. It was striking that he
  lost the car in circumstances in which he usually exhibits absolute control.
  Yet even after what was a blow to his ambitions for a reinvigorated restart at
  Ferrari, he remained upbeat. “Took me by complete surprise what happened, I
  lost the rear up the bank and that was it. I was hoping to save it, but I
  didn’t,” he said. “Apart from that, it’s been a really solid weekend. I feel
  like I made progress, just overall, and my approach and everything. To come
  away with nothing is definitely painful. I’m sad for the team because I really
  wanted to get those points for the team today.” His team principal, Fred
  Vasseur, maintained afterwards that Hamilton remained positive, that he felt
  the weekend had been a step forward with which he was happy despite his error,
  as the Scuderia look forward to their home race at Monza. Hamilton has known
  similar setbacks before and is no stranger to overcoming them, old enough and
  experienced enough to move onwards and, he doubtless hopes, upwards. But
  Norris – in his first real head-to-head title fight – must now draw deep and
  steel himself to these slings and arrows, even as Piastri took a mighty step
  toward the title. Hamilton’s woes were further compounded more than three
  hours after the race when the stewards gave him a five-place grid penalty for
  the Italian Grand Prix, for failing to slow for waved yellow flags on his
  reconnaissance laps to the grid before the race had even begun. Max Verstappen
  took second for Red Bull, while Isack Hadjar was third for Racing Bulls – his
  first podium and a superb result in his rookie season. George Russell was
  fourth for Mercedes and Alex Albon fifth for Williams. Oliver Bearman and
  Esteban Ocon were sixth and 10th for Haas, Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso
  were in seventh and eighth for Aston Martin, and Yuki Tsunoda ninth for Red
  Bull.
