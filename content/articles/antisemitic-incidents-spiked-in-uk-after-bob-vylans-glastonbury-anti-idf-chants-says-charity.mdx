  Reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK spiked the day after the punk duo
  Bob Vylan’s anti-IDF remarks at Glastonbury, campaigners have said. There were
  26 incidents reported on 29 June – the highest daily total of incidents in the
  first half of 2025 – according to the Community Security Trust (CST), a
  monitoring and Jewish community safety organisation. A day earlier, rapper
  Bobby Vylan, one half of the group Bob Vylan, chanted “Death, death to the
  IDF” – referring to the Israel Defense Forces – during the Saturday afternoon
  set at the Glastonbury music festival in Somerset, which was livestreamed by
  the BBC. The CST said the incidents reported to the charity on 29 June
  involved anti-Jewish responses to events at Glastonbury, as well as to the
  CST’s subsequent statement on X, which described the chants as “utterly
  chilling”. The CST says sentiment towards Israel is influencing and driving
  “contemporary anti-Jewish discourse”, though recorded incidents have declined
  from last year’s peak. The second-worst day for what the CST described as
  “anti-Jewish hate” in the first half of this year was 17 May, when 19
  incidents were recorded – coming a day after Israel announced an expansion of
  its military operation in Gaza. The CST said: “Both of these cases (29 June
  and 17 May) illustrate how sentiment and rhetoric towards Israel and Zionism
  influence, shape and drive contemporary anti-Jewish discourse, online and
  offline, often around totemic events.” The organisation said there were 1,521
  antisemitic incidents across the UK in the first half of this year – at least
  200 every month. This is the second-highest total reported to the organisation
  in the first six months of any year but is down by a quarter from the record
  high of 2,019 incidents recorded between January and June last year. Just over
  half (51%) of all incidents in the first half of this year “referenced or were
  linked to Israel, Palestine, the Hamas terror attack (of 7 October 2023) or
  the subsequent outbreak of conflict”, the CST said. This was a similar
  proportion to the same period last year, and up from 16% in the first six
  months of 2023, reflecting a rise in “anti-Jewish hate in the UK when Israel
  is at war”, the CST said. There were 774 antisemitic incidents recorded by the
  CST in Greater London, a drop of 26% over the same timeframe in 2024, and 194
  cases in Greater Manchester, a decrease of 28% compared with the previous
  year. Outside these cities, the areas with the highest number of reports were
  West Yorkshire (73), Hertfordshire (52), Scotland (36), Sussex (32) and the
  West Midlands (39). June 2025 saw the highest number of incidents this year,
  with 326 being recorded after heightening tensions in Gaza. A total of 76
  violent anti-Jewish assaults were recorded by the charity in the first six
  months of 2025, including three categorised as “extreme violence” that
  resulted in either grievous bodily harm or a threat to life. The CST added
  that 84 cases of damage and desecration of Jewish property were recorded, as
  well as 21 incidents of mass-produced antisemitic literature and 1,236
  incidents of verbal or written abuse. Giving examples of the range of
  incidents reported, CST’s chief executive, Mark Gardner, said: “It involves
  racial hatred, yelled at Jewish schoolchildren, scrawled on synagogue walls
  and thrown at anyone who is Jewish or suspected of being Jewish. “We thank
  those politicians and police officers who have supported our community.” The
  home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said antisemitic incidents and crimes “remain
  shamefully and persistently high”. Avon and Somerset police said last month
  that inquiries were continuing in relation to comments made on stage during
  Bob Vylan’s performance.
