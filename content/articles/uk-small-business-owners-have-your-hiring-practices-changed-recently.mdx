  Hiring intentions among British businesses are at a record low, according to
  new research. Experts suggest bosses are “stuck in limbo” and are waiting for
  greater clarity in the autumn budget, as they grapple with rising employment
  costs and worry about the economic outlook. Only 57% of private sector
  employers plan to recruit staff in the next three months – down from 65% in
  autumn 2024, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development
  (CIPD). The hospitality and care sectors, and other organisations that hire
  young people, have been hit the hardest by mounting employment costs, the CIPD
  said. We would like to hear from you if you own a small business and your
  recruitment practices have changed over the last few months. If you’ve had a
  recruitment freeze, tell us why. Is this a short-term measure, or are you now
  resigned to working with fewer staff? If you’re having trouble using the form
