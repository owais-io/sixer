  Corridor care in the NHS is now a year-round crisis, experts have warned, as
  analysis showed nearly 3 million patients attended A&amp;E over the first two
  months of the summer. The latest NHS figures in England, analysed by the
  Liberal Democrats, show that since 2015 the number of people going to A&amp;E
  in June and July has increased 15% to 2.9 million – the highest level recorded
  over the past decade. Whereas 12-hour trolley waits were almost nonexistent a
  decade ago, with just 47 recorded throughout June and July in 2015, in June
  2025 38,683 patients, 7.2% of all those attending A&amp;E, had to wait 12
  hours or more to be admitted. In all, 74,150 patients – 1,216 a day – waited
  at least 12 hours during June and July this year. Some hospitals reported even
  higher proportions of patients facing long waits. More than a quarter of
  patients at five NHS trusts had to wait at least 12 hours to be admitted
  during June and July. They include Epsom and St Helier, where nearly half of
  trolley waits (42% in June and 45% in July) took 12 hours or more, and
  Warrington and Halton (48% in June and 30% in July). Helen Morgan, the Lib Dem
  health and social care spokesperson, said the figures showed the NHS was
  entering a state of “permacrisis”. “What was once a winter crisis has become a
  year-round disaster, with the health service buckling under pressure all year
  round,” she said. “Every day people are put at risk by long, deadly waits with
  families watching helplessly as loved ones are left in agony on trolleys in
  A&amp;E corridors.” The Lib Dems have called for a “winter emergency package”
  of measures to protect patients and take pressure off A&amp;Es, including
  increasing vaccine uptake for illnesses such as flu, expanding access to
  pharmacies and a recruitment drive to increase the number of out-of-hours GPs.
  “Without this, the pressure on our A&amp;Es will continue to mount and
  patients’ safety will be put at risk,” Morgan said. Dr Adrian Boyle, the
  president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the figures
  highlighted that there was no such thing as a summer respite in the NHS any
  more. He said: “If this is the level of demand we are experiencing now, what
  will winter look like, when we have an annual spike in seasonal illness which
  heaps further demand on the system?” Boyle said the government’s winter
  preparedness plan must commit to increasing the number of ward beds available
  and focus on supporting people to leave hospital when they are well enough to
  do so. “Only then will we have any hope of ending the shameful scenes of very
  poorly, often vulnerable, people stranded on trolleys in corridors for long
  and dangerous periods of time. Scenes which are now sadly commonplace in our
  EDs whatever the time of year,” he said. Patricia Marquis, the executive
  director for England at the Royal College of Nursing, said: “An explosion in
  12-hour waits is the clearest indicator that corridor care is now a year-round
  crisis. There has been no respite for understaffed nursing teams during a
  record summer and they will now be worried about what the coming winter has in
  store. “Ministers need to act with urgency before the cold weather arrives and
  stop patients being placed in corridors, cupboards, waiting rooms and any
  space hospitals can spare. It is utterly undignified and will never be a safe
  standard of care.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said:
  “We inherited an emergency care system on its knees, but under this government
  A&amp;E waits continue to improve despite an overall increase in demand,
  ensuring patients are being seen sooner. “We have invested nearly £450m to
  expand urgent and emergency care facilities – delivering more same-day
  emergency care services, more mental health crisis centres and around 500 new
  ambulances – so patients get better, faster emergency care.”
