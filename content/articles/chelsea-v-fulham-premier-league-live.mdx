  Enzo Maresca’s pre-match thoughts It’s a big game, a derby. We know how
  difficult a game it is from last season [when Fulham won 2-1 at Stamford
  Bridge] so hopefully we will be ready. We want to finish with a good feeling
  before the international break. Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku have
  left Chelsea for Munich and Milan respectively. Jacob Steinberg has more. Both
  teams are unchanged from last weekend’s Premier League games. How convenient.
  Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Sanchez; Gusto, Chalobah, Tosin, Cucurella; Caicedo, Enzo;
  Estevao, Joao Pedro, Neto; Delap. Subs: Jorgensen, Acheampong, Fofana, James,
  Hato, Essugo, Andrey Santos, George, Gittens. Fulham (3-5-1-1) Leno; Tete,
  Andersen, Bassey; Castagne, Lukic, Berge, Iwobi, Sessegnon; King; Muniz. Subs:
  Lecomte, Cuenca, Robinson, Reed, Cairney, Wilson, Adama, Smith Rowe, Raul.
  Referee Rob Jones Hello and welcome to live coverage of the west London derby
  at Stamford Bridge. Both teams have had decent starts to the season. Chelsea
  were held by Crystal Palace and thrashed West Ham; Fulham came from behind to
  draw with Brighton and Manchester United. It’s already been a busy day for
  Chelsea, who have loaned/sold Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich. You can read
  about that on our matchday live blog. This blog, this thing here, is all about
  the on-field action. Kick off is at 12.30pm and we’ll have all the team news
  shortly.
