  The Productivity Commission has revealed an ambitious plan to slash the income
  tax rate to 20% for all but the very largest Australian companies. By itself,
  that’s a big idea. For businesses earning between $50m and $1bn a year, their
  rate would drop by 10 percentage points, while the corporate minnows would get
  a 5 percentage point cut. The recommendations were part of the first of five
  PC reports on boosting the country’s flagging productivity, with this first
  paper aimed at lifting investment and business dynamism. So far, so good for
  the vast bulk of corporate Australia. But there was a sting in the tail for
  the big end of town: not only would they miss out on any tax cut, all
  companies would pay a new 5% “net cashflow” tax. If you’ve never heard of such
  a tax, there’s a good reason: it would be a world first. How would the tax cut
  work? As the name suggests, the new tax will be applied purely to cash, rather
  than broader accounting, profits. Interest payments aren’t allowed to be
  deducted, either. A key element is that businesses will be able to immediately
  deduct all of their new capital expenditure. In comparison, firms under the
  company income tax system are only able to progressively deduct a proportion
  of the investment over a number of years. Essentially, the cashflow tax embeds
  instant and complete write-offs for new investment, and the PC reckons this
  feature, combined with the 5-10 percentage point reduction in the headline
  income tax rate, will help drive more investment among the bulk of Australian
  firms. The biggest 500 companies are up for paying more tax overall as they
  are receiving no offsetting reduction in company tax, although the PC points
  out that they can reduce the extra burden by investing more. (The fact that
  there would be two separate company tax rates is a major drawback of the
  proposal, as it would make the whole system more complicated.) Ross Garnaut in
  a 2020 paper proposed a cashflow tax, and has argued it would be “congenial”
  to new businesses which are trying to innovate and invest, but may not have
  the secure future income against which they can deduct the upfront cost of
  that spending. Against that is exhaustive research by the ANU’s Tax and
  Transfer Policy Institute, published in January, which found seven different
  investment tax breaks between the GFC and 2022 did not generate more
  investment by small and medium enterprises. How would this affect big
  business? The fact businesses cannot deduct financing costs means companies
  like coalminer Adani would not be able to avoid paying virtually any tax by
  claiming huge deductions against their taxable income for interest payments on
  loans from associated parties. And there are other ways a cashflow tax limits
  the ability of large companies to avoid paying their fair share. The massive
  gas exporters, for example, would have been able to immediately deduct their
  huge initial investments against the cashflow tax, and uplift the losses over
  time by a set amount. But there would have been no space for the sweetheart
  deals with the government on deductions and which led to years of massive
  super profits, but very little tax for Australians. Are there any other
  benefits of the cashflow tax model? There’s a broader attraction from a
  cashflow tax. By deducting investments upfront and in full, the cashflow tax
  does a better job at taxing the rolling profits from companies’ existing land
  and capital – the profits beyond the cost of the initial investments. Garnaut
  has called a cashflow tax “a tax on economic rent”, which is another word for
  super profits beyond the return required to do business. Businesses can earn
  these super profits for a variety of reasons – a persistent lack of
  competition, or the ownership of natural resources that other companies aren’t
  able to access. Corporate Australia is absolutely rife with such companies,
  from supermarkets, to banks, to miners. The PC’s report suggests that economic
  rents account for 54% of the company income tax base. And that’s up a long way
  from the estimated 41% in 2018. Economists and tax experts like the idea of
  taxing these rents because, in theory, the company is earning more than enough
  to justify its investments and presence in the market, so the extra tax
  shouldn’t affect their decision of whether or not to invest and produce. This
  is especially true when the profits are linked to land, which makes moving the
  business impossible – again, think of natural resources. As the PC in its
  report says, “there is a policy judgement to be made about trade-offs, and
  whether the returns from the limited competition should be predominantly
  enjoyed by the owners of the company or whether some of these returns should
  be returned to the broader community through increased taxation”. “In the
  context of taxation, this is as much a question of equity as it is one of
  efficiency.” So when does it start? Probably not any time soon. There are many
  wrinkles to sort out before the final recommendation is made at the end of the
  year – not least that the big banks will escape paying the cashflow tax in its
  current form! Longer term, though, the PC’s ambition is that the cashflow tax
  would be increased, which would allow the existing, less efficient company
  income tax rate to fall. But that’s a long way away. Not least because the
  hurdle to get this bold plan over the line in the first place looks very high.
  Business lobby groups hate the PC’s proposal, while the accountants body CPA
  Australia is also critical of introducing two separate company taxes. Bob
  Breunig, a leading tax expert at the ANU, says a better option would have been
  to propose a resources rent tax, offset by a lower corporate income tax rate
  for all businesses.
