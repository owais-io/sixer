  Low-wage workers are being offered a controversial new type of high-interest
  loan of up to £25,000 through the “financial wellbeing” app Wagestream, a
  specialist lender that has signed deals with some of the UK’s best-known
  employers including Asda and Pizza Express. The app is pitched as an employee
  benefit, and gives workers access to loans with a representative APR of
  between 13.9% and 19.9%, meaning at least 51% of borrowers will get that rate.
  The ultimate cap is negotiated with each employer, at up to 34.9% APR. The
  “workplace loans” are being rolled out to workers at a selection of companies,
  including those already using Wagestream’s core salary advance service, which
  charges workers a small fee to access up to half their wages early before
  automatically deducting the sum at payday. It is not clear how many of
  Wagestream’s 1,311 clients – which include Superdrug, Domino’s, Halfords,
  Schuh and a number of NHS trusts – are already offering loans. Companies
  working with Wagestream do not lend the money to their workers, and do not
  receive commissions on the loans. Wagestream, which also offers budgeting
  tools and savings pots to help workers manage their finances, says it offers
  an ethical alternative for low-wage workers who would otherwise be pushed to
  higher-cost loans, with many being charged an average APR of 62% before
  turning to Wagestream. However, critics say Wagestream – which is backed by
  social impact investors including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation via the Fair
  by Design Fund, as well as the former Wonga payday loan investor Balderton
  Capital – is making it too easy for low earners to fall into debt, by offering
  salary advances and loans in tandem. There are also concerns that, as with its
  salary advance service, Wagestream is automatically deducting loan payments
  from wages. This enables Wagestream to leapfrog other essential bills and
  practically guarantee that debts are repaid. Workers can opt to make loan
  repayments via direct debit and to pause payments but that requires additional
  negotiation with Wagestream. Adam Butler, the public policy manager at
  StepChange Debt Charity, said lenders who took payment directly from wages
  needed to ensure their loans were not forcing customers to compensate
  elsewhere, including through “additional borrowing, cutting back on essentials
  and missing bills”. Sara Williams, a debt adviser, campaigner and author of
  the Debt Camel blog, said she had “serious concerns” about a company trying to
  sell high-interest loans to customers it had signed up to salary advance
  schemes, which are free to use once a month and then charge a small set fee
  rather than interest. “A business model that gets people to take increasing
  amounts of short-term 0% debts and then sells them an expensive loan to clear
  it raises serious concerns, and the employer should consider if this can
  really align with their workers’ best interest,” she said. Workers who earn
  less than £2,000 a month before tax told the Guardian that they were able to
  borrow at least £1,000 within hours after filling in a quick online form.
  Nadine Houghton, a national officer for the GMB union, which represents
  thousands of Asda workers, said: “For low-paid workers to have the ability to
  access credit at such high interest rates at the click of a button – it’s like
  payday loans.” Houghton said the requirement for lending raised questions
  about sustainable wages at low-wage employers. “We want our members to be paid
  properly for the work they do so they can have savings and don’t have to have
  loans.” One Asda worker told the Guardian that she took out a £1,000 loan in
  March after she “got into a bit of a pickle” using Wagestream to access up to
  half her pay early each month. The interest rate was much lower than that
  previously offered by doorstep lenders and she would not have been able to
  borrow money from most mainstream lenders because of her credit history.
  However, she admits: “I did originally take out the loan to get back to square
  one. “One month I was short on everything, and [organising the loan] was
  really easy and I thought: ‘Let’s see if I can give it a go.’ It took less
  than 10 minutes to fill in everything and was really easy, and the money was
  in my account within two hours.” Asda said: “Since partnering with Wagestream
  in 2023, thousands of colleagues have benefited from the financial wellbeing
  services offered. These include optional salary advances and a savings
  product. “For those who choose to apply for a loan through the Wagestream
  platform, all applications are assessed for affordability and creditworthiness
  in line with FCA regulations governing consumer credit.” A Pizza Express
  spokesperson confirmed that its staff had access to the loans as part of a
  “range of tools” helping employees to access discounts, financial coaching and
  savings products. It said participating was voluntary and that the company did
  not pay for the platform or receive any financial incentives when staff used
  it. Ascension, which manages the Fair by Design Fund through which the Joseph
  Rowntree Foundation became an early-stage investor in Wagestream, said that it
  “recognised the concerns raised” but that many families did not have savings
  to cover unexpected expenses and may have no other option but to turn to
  costly payday or doorstep lenders as a result. “Our priority is to support
  models that can provide more affordable, responsible alternatives, using
  stronger data and affordability checks than were available before,” Ascension
  said. “This is not a substitute for fair wages or a robust welfare system but
  it can help reduce reliance on the most harmful forms of credit.” A Joseph
  Rowntree Foundation spokesperson echoed those comments, saying that while the
  government needed to improve support for households in financial hardship,
  “for now, the need for credit among those living in hardship continues.
  Against this backdrop, there is a role for responsible and impact-focused
  lenders to help families manage the cost of essentials during periods of
  hardship.” Wagestream said: “Wagestream was founded on a social charter to
  improve workers’ financial wellbeing. By partnering with employers, we help
  people who are underserved by traditional financial institutions to earn,
  learn, save, spend and borrow on their own terms. “We are proud to offer a
  fair, accessible alternative which helps our members to build better financial
  futures. We are confident that Wagestream’s products deliver positive
  outcomes, and we remain dedicated to building a more inclusive and equitable
  financial system.”
