  Victorian Labor members have voted to immediately recognise Palestine, heaping
  further pressure on the Albanese government to join Canada, France and the UK
  in their push for a sovereign state. Rank and file members at Labor’s state
  conference on Saturday also carried an urgent resolution to review the Aukus
  submarine deal. However, the wording of the motion was watered down before the
  vote. Labor Friends of Palestine’s motion calling on the federal government to
  immediately recognise Palestine, extend existing sanctions on two Israeli
  ministers to all members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet, and to end all
  direct and indirect military trade with Israel was carried. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The internal campaign group’s Victorian convener, Oliver
  van Ingen, told the conference the measures were “appropriate, effective steps
  that Australia can take to contribute to peace in the Middle East” and were
  backed by unions, Labor members and the wider community. “The time has come
  for sanctions and an end to military trade – they are the only option to
  prevent further atrocities and work towards a long-term solution,” van Ingen
  said. The motion was seconded by Tony Piccolo, from the Australian
  Manufacturing Workers’ Union, who said: “Apartheid is never right, no matter
  who the perpetrators are and the reasons they say it stands. “The behaviours
  we walk past – whether they be in the world, in our community, on the job
  site, or anywhere else – [are] the behaviours that we accept, and, comrades,
  we can’t accept what is going on in the name of self-defence,” Piccolo said.
  “I won’t, and I hope you won’t either.” Attempts to amend the motion were put
  forward by Nick Dyrenfurth, from Labor Friends of Israel, and Dean Sherr, a
  former Albanese adviser and lobbyist, who is also a member of the Jewish
  community, but failed. Dyrenfurth told the conference it was “impractical to
  recognise a Palestinian state at this juncture” and criticised “one-sided
  extreme motions, which endlessly demonise just one party in this ongoing
  conflict”. Anthony Albanese has so far stopped short of matching his UK
  counterpart Keir Starmer’s promise to recognise the state of Palestine in
  September unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a two-state
  solution. Two other resolutions by Friends of Palestine – to increase aid and
  for the protection of civil liberties, including the right to protest – were
  also carried. As was a motion urging a federal review of the Aukus submarine
  deal – but only after criticisms of the US president, Donald Trump, were
  removed, alongside a sentence calling for a “withdrawal” from the partnership.
  “Despite the best efforts of ministers’ offices to have this vote killed off,
  we prevailed and the voice of the rank-and-file has been clearly heard,” the
  Labor Against War Victorian convener, Hamish McPherson, said. A committee
  report that called on the government to suspend funding during the proposed
  inquiry and for the Victorian branch to make a submission calling for
  withdrawal from the Aukus partnership, however, passed. While non binding on
  state or federal Labor MPs, the motions represent one of the most effective
  ways for rank-and-file members and unions to influence party policy. With the
  prime minister in the Northern Territory for the Garma festival, the deputy
  prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, was the most senior party
  figure at Moonee Valley racecourse on Saturday. But he received a lukewarm
  reception, with some delegates refusing to stand as he arrived. During Marles’
  speech, a group of delegates held up their phones to display Palestinian
  flags. Tim Ryder said he participated in the “silent protest” to “hold the
  federal government to account” over their lack of action on Palestine. He also
  criticised the conference for banning placards on the floor this year, saying
  branches were “white hot” with “rage” over the move. Pro-Palestinian
  protesters also gathered outside but were unable to make it into the
  racecourse as they had last year, due to tighter security. Marles said the
  recent federal election result – where the party won 27 of the 38 seats and
  56% of the two-party preferred vote – “enshrines Victoria as Australian
  Labor’s home base”. He thanked volunteers for their “countless hours”
  volunteering during the campaign and vowed to deliver on the “entirety of the
  agenda that we took to this election”. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan,
  used her speech to announce a key policy commitment to enshrine in law the
  right to work remotely two days a week, setting the stage for the 2026 state
  election, which she said “won’t be easy”. “We’ve got a fight on our hands, a
  fight for what we’ve built, a fight for the people who rely on us, a fight for
  the future of this state,” she said. “But let me tell you, it is a fight we
  will win because our cause is just, our record is strong, our vision for the
  future is clear, and our movement is unstoppable when it remembers what it is
  fighting for.”
