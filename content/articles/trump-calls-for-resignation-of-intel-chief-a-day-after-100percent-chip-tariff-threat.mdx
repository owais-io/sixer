  Donald Trump has called on Intel’s chief executive to resign, alleging Lip-Bu
  Tan had ties to the Chinese Communist party, sending the stock of the US
  chipmaker falling. “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign,
  immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. “There is no other
  solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”
  Shares in Intel dropped more than 3% in early trading. The company did not
  immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s post. Trump’s comments
  came a day after he threatened a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and
  chips, which could favor Intel as a US-based semiconductor firm. Trump did
  exclude Taiwan Semiconductor and Apple, companies that have said they plan to
  increase their investments in US manufacturing. Apple chief Tim Cook announced
  from the White House that the company would invest $100bn in US chip
  fabrication. Trump’s criticism of Intel, which has lagged chipmakers such as
  Nvidia in producing graphics-processing chips suitable for AI applications,
  comes after Arkansas senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to company chairman
  Frank Yeary expressing concern over Tan’s investments and ties to
  semiconductor firms that are reportedly linked to the CCP and the People’s
  Liberation Army, the party’s military arm. Cotton, a Republican, asked Intel’s
  board if Tan had divested his interests and questioned if Tan’s previous
  leadership of Cadence Design Systems, a company that last month said it had
  sold products to China’s National University of Defense Technology, a
  violation of US export controls. Cotton said Tan controlled dozens of Chinese
  companies, at least eight of which had ties to the People’s Liberation Army.
  In a statement, the company its board and CEO were “deeply committed to
  advancing US national and economic security interests and are making
  significant investments aligned with the President’s America First agenda.”
  “Intel has been manufacturing in America for 56 years,” the statement said,
  adding that the company looked forward to its “continued engagement with the
  Administration.” Tan, 65, is regarded as an industry veteran in technology and
  venture capital. He was tapped to lead the once-dominant personal computing
  and laptop chipmaker in March as part of a turnaround effort. Intel’s market
  valuation is about $89bn, compared with $4.4tn for rival Nvidia. Tan, 65, has
  said he wants to sell off Intel assets that are not core to the company’s
  revitalization, cut jobs and to delay or cancel projects to reduce operating
  expenses. Intel has received about $8bn from the Chips and Science Act for US
  investments, the Biden-era legislation framed as a national security
  imperative to reduce US dependence on foreign chip production. A number of
  foreign-based chipmakers have recently announced they are boosting US chip
  production , including Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung. Beneficiaries
  of the Chips Act besides Intel include TSMC, Micron Technology, Samsung,
  GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. But the $1bn grants are dwarfed by more
  than $400bn in pledged private-sector investments. The Trump administration
  wants Congress to scrap the Chips Act, arguing that tariffs are a more
  effective incentive for companies to build fabrication plants on US soil,
  pointing to TSMC’s decision to expand its chipmaking capacity from three to
  six plants in Arizona.
