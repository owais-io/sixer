  Debris balls have again washed up along the New South Wales coast as officials
  warn residents not to touch the mysterious spherical globules and to avoid
  beaches where they appear. Central Coast council said on Thursday the debris
  balls – which are grey and about 10mm to 40mm in size – had been found on
  beaches including at The Entrance, the Grant McBride baths, Blue Bay, Toowoon
  Bay, North Shelly, Shelly and Blue Lagoon. Previous similar incidents were
  initially described as “tar balls” composed of crude oil. But testing
  coordinated with the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) revealed they
  were consistent with human-generated waste. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  The EPA said a member of the public first reported the presence of debris
  balls at North Shelly dog beach early on Thursday morning. “Council confirmed
  the presence of debris balls and advised that all visible balls were cleared
  from the beach by mid-afternoon,” said a spokesperson. The council said it did
  not yet know what the new balls were made of, or if they were related to
  previous Sydney debris balls. “Debris balls washed ashore could be from a
  variety of sources or locations such as storm water, sewerage networks, ships
  from local or international locations,” it said. “Further inspections and safe
  clean-up are under way.” It has advised the public to avoid the beaches until
  further notice, to report any sightings and not to touch the debris.
  Environmental officers have collected samples to analyse their composition and
  origin and the incident has been reported to the EPA. Nine beaches were shut
  to the public in Sydney in January – including Manly – after ball-shaped
  debris washed ashore. It followed sightings, and some temporary closures, at
  many of the city’s beaches after the balls started to appear from October
  2024. In that month, thousands of black balls washed up on several eastern
  suburbs beaches including Bondi, Bronte, Coogee and Tamarama. Jon Beves, a
  chemistry professor at the University of NSW who carried out independent
  testing on samples provided to him by Randwick city council, said the Central
  Coast balls looked similar. He has asked Central Coast council if it will
  share samples with him. Beves, one of the few people who has inspected the
  Sydney samples up close, said they contained cooking oil, soap scum and human
  hair, as well as traces of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs. “They smell
  absolutely disgusting,” he said. “You don’t need much imagination to believe
  that they came out of a sewer.” Experts have said Sydney’s ageing sewerage
  system and a growing population were to blame. Sydney’s sewage is only given
  “primary” treatment at wastewater plants in Bondi, Malabar and North Head
  before it is flushed out to sea through “deepwater outfall” pipes that stretch
  to between 2km and 4km off the coast. Prof Stuart Khan, the head of
  engineering at the University of Sydney and chair of an expert panel set up by
  the EPA to investigate the phenomenon, said mysteries remained. “There are
  chemical markers that are pretty clearly human sewage-related, but how the
  system failed, how all of this greasy, fatty material was released at a
  particular time and a particular place is still not clear,” he said. Khan said
  the Central Coast balls could be a product of the Sydney sewerage system,
  managed by the Sydney Water agency, but were more likely to have come from
  local storm water drains and sewers, which are managed by Central Coast
  council. He said the balls could be a result of sewage overflows into storm
  water during recent heavy rain. NSW has had one of its wettest Augusts on
  record in 2025. Chemical analysis could take up to two weeks. “But you don’t
  necessarily know that you’re going to find those same indicators this time,
  regardless of the source,” said Khan. A spokesperson for Sydney Water said
  debris balls collected on Central Coast beaches were being tested in their
  laboratories, initially to confirm if they were the same material that washed
  up in Sydney. They said further testing would “likely take some time to
  determine source and time of event that caused their release”.
