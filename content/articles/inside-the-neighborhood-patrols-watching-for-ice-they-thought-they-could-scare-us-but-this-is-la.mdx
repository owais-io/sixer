  Dawn broke on a foggy morning on Terminal Island, an artificial slice of land
  that rests where the city of Los Angeles meets the Pacific Ocean. Sea lions
  barked in the distance as sleek, white SUVs drove through a checkpoint into a
  federal prison. Chavo Romero, his hair pulled back in a ponytail, sipped
  coffee as he watched them. He awoke before daybreak, taking the day off from
  his public health job to drive here in the dark. Romero is part of a coalition
  of trained volunteers called Unión del Barrio, who patrol the barrios, or
  neighbourhoods, to look for immigration enforcement, “La Migra”. When they
  spot Ice activity, they post videos that go viral, alerting people to seek
  shelter. Since June, Unión del Barrio volunteers have been patrolling Terminal
  Island, where they say federal immigration agents have been staging
  enforcement operations. Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice),
  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other agencies arrive here early in
  the morning, Romero said, before being dispatched to conduct raids across
  southern California. “They’re clocking in to go kidnap people. They see us,
  they flip us off.” By arriving early at Terminal Island, the volunteers have a
  strong vantage point to alert their larger network about which vehicles are
  leaving the staging area – sending photos that show the make, model, color and
  plate number. This enables immigrant communities to be on the lookout for
  these vehicles. For instance, Romero said they had seen the same large white
  van on Terminal Island that was also involved in a violent raid at a cannabis
  farm in Ventura county. More than 200 people were arrested and one man died.
  The patrol’s work is personal for Romero, who is from the farming community of
  Oxnard in Ventura county. His parents are fieldworkers who are Indigenous
  people from Mexico – his dad is Tepehuan and his mom is Guachichil. Romero,
  who wore an army green Unión del Barrio T-shirt on this July morning, joined
  the group 30 years ago. The Los Angeles patrols date back to 1992, after the
  riots that erupted when officers were acquitted of brutally beating Rodney
  King, and in recent months they have emerged as a beacon of resistance as
  California becomes a frontline for raids against immigrant communities. The
  mass arrests reached a violent crescendo in June, when agents in
  military-style clothing grabbed people with brown skin off the streets of Los
  Angeles, dragging them into vans and locking them in detention facilities. On
  11 July, a judge issued a temporary restraining order restricting agents from
  arresting people based on race or occupation anywhere in the central district
  of California, a federal court that serves over 19 million people in southern
  and central California. The order slowed arrests in Los Angeles, but didn’t
  stop them. And immigration enforcement received a windfall this month of $75bn
  from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, noted Romero. “We’re tripling down on
  our patrols,” he said. “The whole order was to end racial profiling … But the
  restraining order doesn’t say stop the deportation and detention. “That will
  never stop,” he added. “It’s a multibillion-dollar industry that needs to keep
  going.” ‘The city is under siege’ Life for immigrants in the US has become
  more precarious since Donald Trump took office and declared an emergency at
  the US-Mexico border, paving the way for raids in the 100-mile border zone,
  including Los Angeles. But few were prepared for just how dire things have
  become. In June, federal agents wearing mirrored glasses and ski masks swept
  through Home Depots, car washes and street vendor stands. They approached
  people with brown skin in the barrios, demanding to see IDs and asking where
  they were from. They tackled people and dragged them into unmarked vans.
  According to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, agents typically had no warrants or
  prior information about the people they arrested – they approached them based
  on skin color or occupation. Keli Reynolds, a Los Angeles immigration attorney
  and founding partner of Olmos &amp; Reynolds, has worked immigration cases
  under five administrations stretching back to George W Bush. “I’ve never seen
  it like this, and I’ve been practicing for 20 years,” she said. “The city is
  under siege. People are terrified.” She noted that none of her clients who
  were detained since the siege began in June had criminal records. “They were
  detaining people, tackling them, and there was absolutely no reasonable
  suspicion,” she said. “They were sweeping areas and detaining, I would say,
  almost 100% Latinos, anybody with brown skin.” In her 11 July order, the judge
  agreed with the ACLU that there was “a mountain of evidence” to support the
  allegations. But she acknowledged that the federal government is allowed to
  carry out large-scale immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The order
  essentially tells Ice to follow the constitution, Reynolds said. The White
  House denies that agents have targeted people based on skin color. On 18 July,
  in response to a reporter’s question, Kristi Noem, the homeland security
  secretary called it a “false narrative that has been put out there in the
  media”. She scolded the reporter: “Don’t you dare ever say that again.” Ice
  agents appear to have shifted their strategy since the order, Reynolds said.
  They are now picking people up outside their homes while claiming to have
  warrants, whether or not they actually produce one. Reynolds said in one case
  in LA county, her client was detained by agents who did not identify
  themselves. “They told her they had a warrant but they didn’t show her a
  warrant. And she even asked to see a warrant, and they said they didn’t have
  to show it to her,” she said. In another incident reported by LA Taco, agents
  tried to arrest a woman at her Huntington Park home, but the community
  confronted them and demanded a warrant. Federal agents continue to target Home
  Depots, but now it’s happening outside of the central district, Romero said.
  On 22 July, Unión del Barrio posted a video showing Ice agents detaining two
  workers at a Home Depot in Encinitas, outside of the zone protected by the
  order. ‘We’re not backing down’ Los Angeles has not returned to normal. The
  barrios remain cautiously quiet. Street vendors have returned to the
  sidewalks, although in smaller numbers. People check social media for Ice
  activity before running errands. “We’re treating it like a ceasefire,” said
  Ron Gochez, founder of Unión del Barrio’s Los Angeles chapter. “During a
  ceasefire, you have to regroup your forces, because you know it’s going to
  start again.” The group’s patrols are a model for the larger Community
  Self-Defense Coalition, which holds training sessions to teach people to
  document Ice activity. Unión del Barrio is using this time to train more
  volunteers. Gochez estimated they had trained 750 people since the court
  order. Gochez is skeptical that the Trump administration, which has routinely
  defied the courts, will continue respecting the order. “We don’t anticipate
  the Trump administration respecting this if it doesn’t go his way,” Gochez
  said. “What we anticipate is three and a half more years of repression against
  us.” The raids are part of a 500-year anti-colonial struggle, Gochez said. “We
  know we’re going to take losses, but in the end, we’re going to win.” Back on
  Terminal Island at around 7.30am, a black four-by-four truck with a federal
  plate pulled up and a man stepped out, watching the volunteers. Romero
  believed they were being surveilled. In June, Unión del Barrio found itself in
  the crosshairs of the administration. Josh Hawley, a Trump ally and chair of
  the Senate subcommittee on crime and counter-terrorism, sent a letter accusing
  them of “aiding and abetting criminal conduct” and providing “logistical and
  financial resources” in relation to the resistance protests. Unión del Barrio
  rejected the allegations, noting that protesters were responding to “a rapidly
  growing number of intentionally cruel, increasingly violent, militarized
  immigration operations across the United States”. “They were asking us to
  voluntarily cease and desist,” said Romero. “We were like: ‘We’re going to
  voluntarily tell you no.’” As he spoke, Romero was interrupted by the
  thrumming of an LAPD helicopter overhead – a familiar sound in the Los Angeles
  barrios. It flew over the group several times. Romero views the city as a
  frontline. “Los Angeles is the most heavily populated urban center of Mexicans
  north of the border,” he said. “If they’re able to crush the LA resistance,
  that means they’re going to be able to do it anywhere else. That’s why LA as a
  frontline has been a critical space to show that the community is organized,
  and we’re not backing down.” He feels proud of the city for providing an
  example of how communities across the country can resist raids. “They really
  thought they were going to come in and scare everyone into their corners, but
  this is LA – and LA is resisting.”
