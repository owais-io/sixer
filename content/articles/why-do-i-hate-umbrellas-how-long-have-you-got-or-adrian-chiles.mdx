  Umbrellas, I don’t like them. Don’t get on with them, never have. When my aunt
  in Zagreb was absorbed in some crime drama on the television, she would say it
  was “as tense as an umbrella”. The English translation doesn’t work, but if I
  may turn it around, I would like to explain why umbrellas make me tense. There
  are so many reasons. If I need an umbrella, I rarely have one. If I do have
  one, I then leave it somewhere. If it’s windy, that humiliating inside-out
  thing might happen. All in all, it is very much not worth the bother. My
  hairdo isn’t changed by rain anyway. Yet so many people don’t seem to leave
  home without an umbrella, and they are only one raindrop away from calling on
  it. I marvel at this level of organisation, even envy it, but there should be
  a law against putting up a brolly if significant rain isn’t coming down. Late
  for a hospital appointment last week, I was hurrying along a city street when
  I felt the merest sprinkle of rain tickle my cheek. In an instant, the
  umbrella ultras sprang into action. It was as if this was the moment for which
  they had been waiting, yearning. Their internal rainometers, being set to
  ultrasensitive, were triggered. And with astonishing speed and economy of
  movement, umbrellas were retrieved and unfurled. Their reaction times were
  something to behold. They were like sprinters hearing the B in bang, or Clint
  Eastwood in one of those spaghetti westerns – so quick on the draw that the
  journey of the brolly from handbag to hand to unfurling is barely observable
  to the naked eye. “Unfurl” isn’t quite the right word, implying as it does a
  more leisurely movement. This is more like a snapping open, as violent as the
  snapping shut of a Venus flytrap. One moment there are no umbrellas, then
  there are dozens. I would say a third of pedestrians on this particular
  street, on the approach to Guy’s hospital in London, were now brollied up.
  This changed everything. I gave in to despair. I was already late, and this
  was going to hold me up still further. We were now split into two groups: the
  brolly-holders and the brolly-dodgers. The former move faster than the latter.
  Shielded from rain and harm by their lethal weapons they can hold a straight
  line, armed with this contraption featuring at least eight metal ribs, the
  tips of which can cause untold harm to those they prod. The potential for
  ripping, tearing and the poking out of eyes is very real. I’m 6ft 1in tall
  and, I now realise, particularly vulnerable to eye injury. I’ve just measured
  my neighbour, Dawn, who comes in at 5ft 4in – roughly the average height of a
  British woman. I gave her a standard eight-rib weapon to hold and, sure
  enough, the tips are precisely at my eye-height. Out there, on the pavement,
  in brolly-battle conditions, you have a choice: pull in behind a brolly-holder
  and work their slipstream, proceeding at a pace dictated by them. Or, if you
  are brave, foolish or late enough, the brolly-dodging must commence. There are
  two key manoeuvres, both tricky. Overtaking a slow-mover ought to be easier
  than dealing with oncoming traffic, but often they don’t know you are there,
  so could catch you inadvertently. Those striding towards you will see you
  coming but they will generally hold their line anyway, as they are armed and
  you’re not. On occasion you will be swaying to avoid a sudden deviation from
  someone you are overtaking, and momentarily lose sight of an oncomer hard upon
  you. At this point you need to be able to duck and weave like Muhammad Ali in
  his prime. To develop your technique I would also recommend watching YouTube
  videos of legendary rugby centres such as Brian O’Driscoll, Sonny Bill
  Williams or Ma’a Nonu dancing their way through defensive lines. Yes, it is
  this kind of fleetness of foot you need to develop if you wish to move at
  speed in even a light drizzle on a busy British pavement. • Adrian Chiles is a
