  Slot concern over Liverpool vulnerability A visit to an expectant Anfield,
  where Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitiké will be out to impress on their Premier
  League debuts, represents a daunting start for a Bournemouth team that have
  lost three-quarters of last season’s backline to the pulling power of Real
  Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool this summer. Defensive issues are
  not exclusive to Andoni Iraola before the Premier League opener, however. Arne
  Slot voiced concern over the champions’ pre-season vulnerability before and
  after the Community Shield against Crystal Palace, when the absence of Ryan
  Gravenberch for family reasons was keenly felt. “Three times we lost the ball
  very simple in our midfield and three times they could counterattack us,”
  reflected the Liverpool head coach. Gravenberch will be missing again on
  Friday through suspension but Slot expects the team with the second-best
  defensive record in the Premier League last season to react as soon as the
  serious business begins. “Mixed teams, new players coming in, Virgil [van
  Dijk] being sick, Alisson not being there,” he listed as reasons for
  Liverpool’s recent difficulties on Thursday. “But all of this is not an excuse
  when we start the league. We will 100% be ready on Friday.” Andy Hunter
  Liverpool v Bournemouth, Friday 8pm (all times BST) Ramsey sale a blow for the
  romantics The absence of Alexander Isak will invariably dominate the discourse
  at Villa Park on Saturday lunchtime but Newcastle’s move for Jacob Ramsey
  means there is another intriguing subplot. Villa selling Ramsey, who joined
  their academy aged six, frees them to strengthen after a slow summer – and
  pocket £40m of profit. But it also serves as a reminder of the demoralising
  financial landscape in the era of profitability and sustainability
  regulations. PSR rules have also dictated deals for Newcastle, namely Elliot
  Anderson – a star in waiting for England – and Yankuba Minteh joining
  Nottingham Forest and Brighton respectively last year. Unai Emery is a big
  admirer of Ramsey, who would have been in line to start for Villa this
  weekend, but ultimately money talks. The 24-year-old lived his dream: playing
  for his boyhood club. There is always romanticism on the eve of a new season
  but Ramsey’s imminent sale is a reminder that football is a business. Ben
  Fisher Aston Villa v Newcastle, Saturday 12.30pm De Cuyper can sparkle on
  Brighton’s left As usual, Brighton did their transfer business early this
  summer and it seems that Maxim De Cuyper has settled on the south coast
  already. The Belgium left-back, who joined from Club Brugge for £17.3m on a
  five-year deal, has been outstanding in pre-season as Fabian Hürzeler’s side
  have gone unbeaten. De Cuyper capped last week’s 2-1 win over Wolfsburg with a
  goal and has immediately struck up an understanding with Kaoru Mitoma down the
  left. Hürzeler is hoping Brighton could have another gem on their hands as
  they prepare to welcome Fulham in their opening match on Saturday. “I’m very
  impressed, because he integrated as a person quite quickly, and that’s
  something I don’t see that often in the football business,” the Brighton head
  coach said. Ed Aarons Brighton v Fulham, Saturday 3pm Wilson can spoil party
  at rejuvenated old rivals Sunderland have sold their entire complement of
  38,000 season tickets this summer and their 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light
  will be full when West Ham arrive on Saturday. After eight years away from the
  Premier League – including a stint in League One – they are back in the big
  time and have prepared themselves with 11 summer signings, five aged 21 or
  under, acquired for a collective sum in excess of £132m. If turning all those
  new faces into a functioning team will stretch Régis Le Bris’s undoubted
  coaching talents to the maximum, locals have reason to fear one particular
  visitor who recently arrived at West Ham on a free transfer. The former
  Newcastle and England striker Callum Wilson is now part of Graham Potter’s
  squad and would like little better than scoring the winning goal while
  eclipsing Enzo Le Fée, Granit Xhaka and the rest of Le Bris’s top-tier new
  boys. Louise Taylor Sunderland v West Ham, Saturday 3pm Yet another new era
  dawns at Spurs Tottenham have had more eras than Taylor Swift but without
  quite the same success, so the start of yet another should barely register.
  However, the sense persists that in Thomas Frank they have found the right
  manager at the right time, someone able to inspire individuals and the
  collective while being equally adept at finding tactical edges and solutions –
  he appears already to have inculcated set-piece prowess into his new charges.
  But just as they played well against Paris Saint-Germain then contrived to
  lose in a manner that could only be described as classic Spurs, so Burnley at
  home is precisely the kind of fixture they traditionally avoid winning. Nor
  will it be enough just to take the points: at the start of his tenure, Ange
  Postecoglou was extremely successful in their accumulation, but it was obvious
  the run couldn’t last, and it didn’t. Frank can buy himself time with good
  results, but over time, he must deliver a side that play dominant football.
  Daniel Harris Tottenham v Burnley, Saturday 3pm Newcomer Trafford gets City
  chance How different will Manchester City look at Molineux? Pep Guardiola’s
  side finished last season strong, barring defeat in the FA Cup final, but City
  sought signings after conceding they were not aggressive in the market last
  summer. They have added six new faces and it will be interesting if James
  Trafford is preferred to Ederson in goal. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and
  Rayan Aït-Nouri could also all feasibly start, the last of those against his
  former club. Cherki may be the most exciting of City’s new signings but
  Guardiola’s goalkeeping decision feels most significant. Trafford has been
  given the No 1 shirt but what if Ederson, such an instrumental player across
  six Premier League title triumphs, stays put? This week City stopped short of
  denying interest in Gianluigi Donnarumma as a potential replacement for the
  Brazilian, who is into the final 12 months of his contract. Trafford is
  expected to start at Wolves and a solid debut could provide Guardiola with his
  answer. BF Wolves v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm Chelsea’s new strikers to
  thrive without Jackson Nicolas Jackson being unavailable would have presented
  Chelsea with a headache last season. They did not have suitable cover for the
  striker, who remains suspended after his red card against Newcastle in May,
  but depth in attack is no longer an issue. Liam Delap and João Pedro joined in
  the summer and are competing to lead the line when Crystal Palace visit
  Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Both forwards did well during Chelsea’s victorious
  Club World Cup campaign and impressed in last weekend’s friendlies against
  Bayer Leverkusen and Milan. João Pedro scored in both warm-ups, Delap came off
  the bench to score against Milan and no one noticed the absence of Jackson,
  who was left out of the squad after indicating a desire to leave before the
  window shuts. Jacob Steinberg Chelsea v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm Can
  overachieving Bees and Forest sustain progress? This fixture at the City
  Ground features two sides whose seasons feel hard to predict. Nottingham
  Forest were superb last term, expressing Nuno Espírito Santo’s tactical ideas
  to the nth degree and adding some much-needed variety to the league. Repeating
  the success, though, is a harder task: opposing players now have experience of
  facing them and analysts have had time to identify their weaknesses. Forest
  still look well placed to grow: retaining Morgan Gibbs-White is a coup and his
  midfield partnership with the excellent, still-improving Elliot Anderson is
  good enough to compete with any in the league. Brentford, meanwhile, have lost
  three stalwart players with perhaps another yet to depart, as well as the
  manager who was at the heart of everything. Chances are the club were prepared
  for Thomas Frank’s departure, their processes embedded so as not to be reliant
  on any individual. Yet replacing him is about more than that: Keith Andrews
  cannot just preside over a technocracy but must embody it with soul. DH
  Nottingham Forest v Brentford, Sunday 2pm New-look United and Arsenal stir
  memories of ’89 These teams met on the opening day of 1989-90. Manchester
  United were useless and under new ownership, so had spent heavily (which
  sounds familiar to modern fans) while Arsenal were champions (less so). Just
  as Alex Ferguson told his board drastic measures were necessary, so too has
  Ruben Amorim, with three new attackers arriving at no little cost. Bryan
  Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were bought as almost-sure things, Premier
  League-proven and hitting their peak, but more interesting is the purchase of
  Benjamin Sesko, a 22-year-old physical freak who looks as if he plays on fast
  forward. Arsenal were also interested, but their need to win immediately meant
  they plumped for Viktor Gyökeres, his ceiling lower and natural gifts fewer,
  but who is already the best version of himself. Which side got the better deal
  will not be evident after Sunday – in August 1989, United won 4-1, then
  finished 13th – but it will be fascinating to see how each acquisition
  integrates and fares. DH Manchester United v Arsenal, Sunday 4.30pm Can
  Harrison and Calvert-Lewin steal Grealish spotlight? It really will be a case
  of friends reunited when Leeds host Everton on Monday night. While Daniel
  Farke hopes to be able to include Dominic Calvert-Lewin in his matchday squad,
  the former Goodison Park centre-forward will not be the only familiar face to
  be greeted by the visiting manager, David Moyes. Leeds are returning to the
  Premier League after a two-year absence and their winger Jack Harrison has
  spent those two seasons on loan at Everton. This has not gone down well with
  many Elland Road regulars and Harrison has been audibly booed throughout
  pre-season. Can the 28-year-old win the West Yorkshire public over? Given that
  the last time Leeds were promoted, five years ago, Covid restrictions meant
  games were played at empty stadiums, there should be a party atmosphere but
  Moyes’s marquee summer signing, the Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish, will
  doubtless be determined to ruin it. All eyes will inevitably be on Grealish
  but this could also be a big night for Calvert-Lewin and Harrison. LT Leeds v
  Everton, Monday 8pm
