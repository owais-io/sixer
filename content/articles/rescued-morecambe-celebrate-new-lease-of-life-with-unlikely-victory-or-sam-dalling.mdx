  “Well, well, well,” begins the voice over the public address system. Almost
  all of the 3,700-odd supporters inside the Mazuma Stadium are still dancing
  wildly, Mark Swindlehurst’s words barely registering. He has been Morecambe
  Football Club’s volunteer announcer for 32 years, and his speech is dripping
  in emotion. Seconds earlier, in the eighth of 10 added minutes, the substitute
  Daniel Ogwuru secured a precious winner. As Morecambe broke, Ashvir Singh
  Johal, who replaced Derek Adams as manager only on Monday, placed his hands on
  his head. As the net burst, and with it the home terrace, he galloped giddily
  down the touchline. “The only thing we didn’t practise was going to a 5-3-2,”
  Johal said later, composure regained. “The players came to me, and I wrote on
  a bit of paper to show them. We scored on the counterattack from that
  situation.” A grin emerges. “I was quite pleased with that!” Even before the
  late twist, Saturday was inked in as a day of celebration. An early-season
  match against Altrincham would not ordinarily be greeted with such enthusiasm,
  but this was, if not the most important fixture in the English professional
  game this season, then certainly the most critical in the club’s 105-year
  history. Having lost Football League status in April, the club and the town
  were a shrimp’s shell’s breadth from losing so much more. A convoluted
  takeover, one delayed and delayed by the former owner Jason Whittingham and
  his Bond Group, left the club days from being removed from the National
  League. Last Sunday, the suspension was lifted and the Panjab Warriors, who
  gained English Football League approval for the purchase in early June, were
  finally able to complete their investment. The wait must have felt worthwhile
  as their representatives celebrated gleefully from the directors’ box as a
  result manifested earlier by the club DJ played out. Kick-off was still 90
  minutes away when D:Ream started playing. The lyrics “Things can only get
  better” were apt. Keith, a fan who has been taking the drum hung by his side
  to games for three decades, said of the previous uncertainty: “I went through
  tears and anger – those were the two extremes. It was like part of my life had
  gone. Football is a game at the end of the day, but it is a huge part of
  people’s lives and the whole community.” Jeff Calvert, present at Wembley when
  Morecambe won the 1974 FA Trophy, arrived early with son Paul, his wife, his
  daughter and his three grandsons. “It’s magical,” he said. “Still surreal at
  the moment. Thank goodness for Panjab Warriors.” “I’ve been checking Facebook
  constantly for months – I’ve got a repetitive strain injury in my thumb,” Paul
  added, smiling. In a swirling ocean of red and black, familiar faces greeted
  each other and early arrivers were buoyed up by the news that club staff had
  stuck £500 behind the ground’s bars. “I never stopped believing,” Anne told
  her friends in the queue. Some of them did. Come 11.30am the instantly
  recognisable dull ring of a PA system preparing for duty sounded. “The
  turnstiles are now open.” Sweet, sweet words. Simultaneously, the team sheet
  confirmed that the five senior players on the books last week would line up
  alongside six newbies. Even Craig David could not do lyrical justice to
  Morecambe’s seven days. Takeover complete on Sunday; new gaffer in on Monday;
  a dozen new signings from Wednesday; three points on Saturday. So quick was
  the turnaround that a mini tube of Pringles was the closest to a hot meal
  available and the club shop had no replica shirts. They all went weeks ago at
  a pop-up event run by the kit supplier Terrace on the promenade. Ten minutes
  before the start, Morecambe’s new custodians were introduced to the crowd.
  Unsurprisingly, the reception received was rapturous and rousing. Johal was
  afforded a similar ovation. Talk about dropping from a height into roaring
  flames. Not only is this Johal’s maiden senior role, but also, aged 30, he is
  the youngest manager across English football’s top five tiers. Oh, and he is
  the first Sikh to manage a professional British club. He has a fine record in
  youth football, though, including time spent with Cesc Fàbregas in Como, and
  was Kolo Touré’s assistant during a brief stint at Wigan. Management is his
  dream. “This is not a learning experience for me, because I’m not here to
  learn,” he said. “I’m here to win and be the best manager I can be.” At
  12.36pm, the seemingly impossible happened: Ben Tollitt, one of last season’s
  survivors, nudged Morecambe ahead. Johal, his assistant Lee Tomlin and the
  entire bench shared warm, meaningful embraces, as did friends, loved ones and
  strangers around the ground. Can you just imagine? Seven days ago most of them
  couldn’t. Given training amounted to 120 minutes across two sessions,
  Morecambe were excellent. True, they conceded a first-half equaliser and by
  the end suffered a cramp epidemic, but they held on. And then some. Post
  match, Bring Me Sunshine, a song synonymous with the area thanks to the comedy
  duo Morecambe and Wise, was aired. It was sung with gusto by almost everyone.
  In future, Whittingham’s tenure – the good (spoiler: not much) and the
  disastrous (spoiler: plenty) – will be discussed in local watering holes and
  amusement arcades till the cockles come home. But all that really matters now,
  like truly, properly, actually, matters, is that a community’s metronome
  remains ticking. If Morecambe can flip attention into momentum, a bright
  future awaits. First, though, Aldershot away on a bank holiday Monday. A
  524-mile round trip, thank you very much. 5am coach, you say? Bloomin’ heck.
