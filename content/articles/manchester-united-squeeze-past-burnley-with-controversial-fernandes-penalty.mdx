  It is easy to see why Ruben Amorim has developed a love-hate relationship with
  his players after a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty controversially earned
  Manchester United’s first win of the season. The result should not have been
  in doubt but poor finishing and defending meant the hosts had to rely on the
  referee, Sam Barrott, to visit the pitchside monitor and overturn his own
  decision. Josh Cullen’s own goal gave United a deserved lead they should have
  built on but Lyle Foster and Jaidon Anthony were twice allowed to equalise
  either side of Bryan Mbeumo scoring United’s second in 11 chaotic second-half
  minutes. The match was heading for a draw until it was belatedly judged that
  Anthony had pulled down Amad Diallo and the United captain did the rest to
  send Old Trafford wild, while Burnley fumed. But once again, as at Grimsby in
  the Carabao Cup, Amorim did not watch the penalty. Things should have been far
  easier for United. There was an early intensity here as the supporters
  inspired the players and vice versa. The aggression on and off the field was
  designed to intimidate Burnley, and it had the potential to work. United had
  all the possession in the initial stages and looked sharper in mind and foot
  than at Grimsby as they attempted to play through the visitors, creating
  numerous half chances without testing the goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka. The
  former Manchester City captain Kyle Walker was the most unpopular man in the
  stadium. He was booed when his name was read out and every time he touched the
  ball. He tried to curry favour when a desperately poor clearance was blocked
  by Mason Mount, who collected the ball and drove towards the box, with Walker
  pulling at him. A foul was committed and looked like the only debate was
  whether the indiscretion happened inside or outside of the box. Barrott
  decided it was a penalty but the video assistant referee sent him to review
  the footage on the monitor and minutes after the original decision, the
  referee joined Walker in the bad books when he changed his call. If there were
  any fears of a divide at United, injustice is a good tool to unify everyone.
  Technology worked in their favour when the referee’s watch bleeped to say the
  ball had crossed the line after Casemiro’s header had struck the bar and
  bounced in off Cullen’s back before Dubravka could act. Even if the manner was
  fortuitous, the goal was thoroughly merited. Knowing how to control a game
  when ahead is an art they are yet to master, as the draw at Fulham showed.
  Burnley also realised they needed to move from a passive to progressive
  mindset and push forward. Hannibal Mejbri could have marked his return to Old
  Trafford with a goal but fired over from 10 yards. United resettled after
  Matheus Cunha was forced off injured and replaced by Joshua Zirkzee. A second
  goal should have arrived from a dynamic break in first-half stoppage time but
  Amad fluffed his lines from close range. After 55 minutes of positivity and
  with the thought of long-term optimism starting to creep in, it was flushed
  away when Jacob Bruun Larsen swung in a perfect cross for the unmarked Lyle
  Foster to jab home from close range to begin a manic period of the match. With
  Old Trafford stunned into silence, the mindset was that of fearing the worst.
  Direct play changed that when Diogo Dalot reached Zirkzee’s flick and pulled
  the ball back into Mbeumo’s path for his first home goal as a United player,
  home fans rediscovering their voices 90 seconds after going mute. Structure
  had been forgotten, producing a riotous tempo. While the celebrations for
  United’s second died down, Foster had a goal ruled out for offside but the
  hosts were fragile. Once again, a set piece in front of the Stretford End was
  United’s undoing. They failed to clear the ball, allowing Loum Tchaouna to
  fire a shot which Altay Bayindir parried straight to Anthony, who bundled home
  a third goal in nine minutes to conclude the immediate chaos – but there was
  more to come. Fitting with the helter-skelter nature of the game, Barrott gave
  nothing after Amad ended up on the turf inside the box. He ran to the referee,
  who eventually went to review the incident and decided Anthony had held on too
  long. Burnley were incensed but Fernandes shut out the noise before creating
  euphoria, as troubles are briefly forgotten and pressure is relieved until the
  Manchester derby in two weeks.
