  Donald Trump has dismissed speculation that he is in ill health, saying he was
  busy on the Labor Day weekend giving media interviews and visiting his
  Virginia golf course. “I was very active over the weekend,” Trump, 79, told
  reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday. Asked about rumours on social media
  that he may have died, he called them “fake news”. The president complained
  that he had done several news conferences last week “then I didn’t do any for
  two days and they said ‘there must be something wrong with him’.” “It’s so
  fake. ‘Is he OK, how’s he feeling, what’s wrong?’” Speculation about his
  health swirled on X over the weekend, with posts citing his lack of a public
  schedule late last week and a JD Vance interview in which the vice-president
  told USA Today he was confident the president was “in good shape” but
  suggested he was prepared to step in if anything happened to Trump. Here’s the
  day’s Trump administration news at a glance. Trump illegally deployed national
  guard to LA, court rules A judge has found the Trump administration’s use of
  national guard troops during southern California immigration enforcement
  protests was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer ruled on Tuesday that the
  administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany federal
  agents on immigration raids. The judge did not require the remaining troops
  withdrawn, however. Read the full story Ice obtains access to Israeli-made
  spyware US immigration agents will have access to one of the world’s most
  sophisticated hacking tools after a decision by the Trump administration to
  move ahead with a contract with Paragon Solutions, a company founded in Israel
  which makes spyware that can be used to hack into any mobile phone, including
  encrypted applications. Read the full story US House committee releases more
  than 33,000 pages of Jeffrey Epstein files The US House of Representatives
  oversight committee released thousands of pages of records related to the
  disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein from the justice department. The 33,000
  pages included years-old court filings related to Epstein and his former
  associate Ghislaine Maxwell as well as what appears to be body-cam footage
  from police searches and police interviews. The release on Tuesday comes as
  the Trump administration has been embroiled in months of controversy over its
  decision not to release additional files in the case. Read the full story
  Trump announces Space Command HQ will switch to Alabama from Colorado Donald
  Trump made his first public appearance in a week on Tuesday to announce that
  the US Space Command (Spacecom) headquarters, which is tasked with leading
  national security operations in space, would be in the Republican stronghold
  of Alabama. Flanked by Republican senators and members of Congress at a White
  House news conference, Trump said Huntsville, Alabama, would be the new
  location of the space command. The move reverses a Biden administration
  decision to put the facility at its current temporary headquarters in
  Democratic-leaning Colorado. Read the full story Amy Coney Barrett defends US
  abortion ruling in memoir The conservative supreme court justice Amy Coney
  Barrett, whose controversial fast-track confirmation at the end of Trump’s
  first presidency led directly to the panel’s vote to strike down abortion
  rights nationally, has expressed in a new memoir her belief that the ruling
  “respected the choice” of the American people. Barrett was paid a $2m advance
  for her book, Listening to the Law, according to CNN, which obtained a copy
  and published brief extracts on Tuesday, a week before its 9 September
  publication. Read the full story What else happened today: A US appeals court
  has allowed US federal trade commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, to
  resume her role at the agency, as Donald Trump tries to remove her from
  office. Jerry Nadler, a Democratic representative from New York, will retire
  next year after 34 years in Congress. One of the world’s most prominent hedge
  fund billionaires, Ray Dalio, has warned that rising inequality is turning the
  US into an autocratic state and condemned business leaders for failing to
  speak out against Trump’s policies. Woody Allen has said he was impressed by
  the acting abilities of Donald Trump when he directed the now-president in the
  1998 film Celebrity. Catching up? Here’s what happened on 1 September 2025.
