  The Italian government has given the final approval for the construction of a
  multibillion-euro bridge linking Sicily to the mainland, a project that has
  been a topic of debate since at least the late 1960s but has been held back by
  a litany of concerns, including the huge cost, seismic risks and mafia
  infiltration. Giorgia Meloni’s rightwing government has set aside €13.5bn to
  build what would be the longest single-span bridge in the world. A dream of
  Italy’s late former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and revived soon after
  Meloni’s government came to power in 2022, the 3.7km bridge and its
  surrounding facilities are expected to take 10 years to build. Cars, trains
  and foot passengers currently cross the Strait of Messina, between the
  Sicilian city of the same name and Villa San Giovanni in Calabria, by ferry –
  a journey that takes about 30 minutes. The green light for the bridge, which
  the government argues would give a much-needed economic boost to Italy’s
  poorer south, was given by an inter-ministerial committee on Wednesday, said
  the transport minister, Matteo Salvini, who is also the project’s chief
  backer. Salvini described it as “a metro over the strait”. Salvini said the
  approval would need to be validated by the national audit court, which could
  take a few weeks, but said he was optimistic work would begin “in September or
  October”. “The Strait of Messina is a project without precedent in the world,”
  Salvini told reporters. “This goal is to complete by 2032-33.” Salvini added
  countering any attempt at criminal infiltration in the project would be the
  government’s “raison d’être”. “We must monitor the entire supply chain to
  ensure it is impervious to criminals,” he said, adding if it was discovered
  that the mafia was involved then the bridge would not be built. It will be
  constructed by a consortium led by Italy’s Webuild Group and including Spain’s
  Sacyr and the Japanese group IHI. Pietro Salini, the chief executive of
  Webuild, said the project would be “transformative for the whole country”. The
  company estimates the bridge’s construction will create more than 100,000
  jobs. The approval will allow for preliminary works, including archaeological
  and geological surveys, to be carried out. An estimated 4,000 people on either
  side of the strait will be forced to leave their homes as part of an
  expropriation plan. They will be compensated, but this has not been enough to
  stop frequent protests against the bridge’s construction. Despite Berlusconi’s
  attempts to approve the project during his three governments, it was rejected
  because of the high costs, engineering impracticability and the environmental
  impact. Environmental associations this week filed a complaint with the EU,
  flagging serious risks for the local environment, while Angelo Bonelli, an MP
  for the Greens and Left Alliance, said the plan was “a colossal waste of
  money” and vowed to continue to fight against it. The area of the construction
  is also among those with the highest seismic risks in Europe.
