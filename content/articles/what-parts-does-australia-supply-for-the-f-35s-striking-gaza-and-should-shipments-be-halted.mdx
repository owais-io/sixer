  The Australian government has announced it will recognise the state of
  Palestine, but many politicians and human rights groups are demanding tougher
  action to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Greens have urged the
  Albanese government to stop supplying F-35 parts to a global supply chain that
  can be accessed by Israel, in addition to direct sanctions on senior members
  of the Netanyahu government. But the federal government denies it is sending
  weapons to Israel and has criticised “misinformation” about the F-35s. So what
  do we know about Australia’s role in the supply chain? Does Israel use F-35s?
  The Israel Defense Forces has confirmed F-35 planes are used to “strike terror
  targets and assist ground forces in very close proximity strikes”. In February
  last year, a Dutch appeals court found it was likely that F-35s were being
  used in attacks on Gaza, and a “clear risk” that parts exported from the
  Netherlands were “used in serious violations of international humanitarian
  law”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In September, Danish media reported
  Israel had confirmed an F-35 was used in a missile strike in southern Gaza
  that killed 90 people and injured hundreds more. Lawyers representing the
  Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq have previously told a UK court the
  F-35s have played a critical role in Gaza and linked them to airstrikes that
  have killed more than 400 people, including 183 children and 94 women. The
  Israeli government was contacted for comment. What is Australia supplying?
  More than 75 Australian companies have contributed to the global supply chain
  for the F-35 program, according to the defence department. More than 700 of
  the fighter jet’s “critical pieces” are manufactured in Victoria alone,
  according to the state government. One company, RUAG Australia, is the only
  global supplier of the F-35’s “uplock actuator system”, which allows the jet
  to quickly open its bay doors and fire missiles while maintaining stealth.
  Australia also hosts a regional distribution hub for F-35 parts. In April, the
  defence department said Australian companies have been paid about $5bn for
  their contributions to the F-35 supply chain so far. This is a relatively
  small proportion of the overall program. Last year, the US government
  accountability office said the F-35s would cost “more than $2tn over several
  decades”. There are more than 1,900 companies in the global supply chain. Who
  are we supplying? The global supply chain is coordinated by the F-35’s primary
  manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, in the US. The fighter jet is used by the US
  and 19 allies, including the UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Japan and South
  Korea. Manufacturers are not contracted to supply parts to one specific
  nation, such as Israel. Instead, they supply enough parts for large batches of
  F-35s that are bought from Lockheed Martin. In July, the Declassified website
  published a story alleging that civilian and military use aircraft parts had
  been sent from Sydney to Tel Aviv. The story cited shipping records that
  allegedly listed Lockheed Martin as the source of some parts and described
  them as being for the “JSF” – the F-35 joint strike fighter. An Australian
  government spokesperson said it “does not have a direct bilateral arrangement
  with the government of Israel in relation to the F-35 program”. “Australia has
  not supplied weapons or ammunition to Israel since the Israel-Gaza conflict
  began and not for at least the past five years,” the spokesperson said. A
  Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company “complies with US and
  international laws”. How quickly could other countries replace Australian
  parts? Parts can only be sourced from nations allied with the US due to
  national security fears. In 2022, deliveries were briefly suspended when
  Chinese parts were discovered in an F-35. “Replacing such suppliers would not
  be straightforward, as Lockheed would have a limited list of countries from
  which to source components,” said Kelsey Gallagher, a senior researcher with
  the Canada-based research institute Project Ploughshares, who specialises in
  the F-35 supply chain. “A country like Australia refusing to transfer F-35
  components could have a sizeable impact on the program, given how many
  individual aircraft they are contracted to supply at once,” Gallagher said.
  Would withholding parts have an impact? It depends on the parts. Several
  Australian companies are the sole global supplier for some F-35 parts. If
  these parts were withheld, there could be a significant short-term impact on
  repairs and sales. Last year, Lockheed Martin told a US court that one
  relatively small supplier not providing titanium products, as contracted to do
  so, would “cause unavoidable and substantial delays in Lockheed Martin’s
  delivery of F-35 aircraft to the United States, threatening national security
  and Lockheed Martin’s reputation and goodwill”. Josh Paul, a former US state
  department official who resigned over US arms shipments to Israel, says the
  impact would be greatest if nations acted together in protest against the
  killing in Gaza. “The nature of the [F-35] consortium is that all of the
  countries would feel the crunch and therefore feel compelled to accept that
  agreement,” Paul told the ABC. If we did withhold parts, would companies be
  fined? Gallagher said most of the contracts between Lockheed Martin and small
  companies, including subcontractors in Australia, were not public and it was
  difficult to make claims with certainty. But he referred to a 2025 Lockheed
  Martin corporate document that told suppliers their “timely performance is a
  critical element” of their contracts. “Logically, a subawardee failing to
  supply parts following a contract signing could only be seen as a breach of
  that contract, whatever the reason,” Gallagher said. In 2023, Lockheed Martin
  sued US-based subcontractor Howmet for failing to deliver F-35 components
  after a contract dispute. The matter was settled out of court and Howmet
  continues to supply parts. Gallagher said Lockheed Martin faces financial
  penalties from the US department of defence for failing to deliver jets on
  time. “It could then follow that Lockheed would pass those penalties on to
  subcontractors that have some part in the delays,” Gallagher said. What have
  other countries done? So far, no country has withdrawn from the F-35 supply
  chain. But several companies have taken action to reduce or cut the supply of
  new military equipment to Israel. Germany has stopped exporting material that
  could be used by Israel during its military operations in Gaza. Germany is the
  second-largest arms supplier to Israel after the US. Australia’s defence
  minister, Richard Marles, says Australia cannot announce similar action to
  Germany as it does not directly supply arms to Israel. Regarding the F-35
  parts, he said on Sunday: “That is a multilateral arrangement with supply
  chains that are organised by Lockheed Martin in the United States and have
  multiple suppliers in respect of all of those supply chains.” The German
  company Rheinmetall produces fuselages for the global F-35 supply chain. These
  contributions have not been stopped. In September, the UK suspended most
  relevant arms export licences for use in Israel. Would withholding parts
  threaten national security? Some nations think so, but this is difficult to
  independently substantiate. When the UK suspended arms export licenses, it
  gave a carve-out to the F-35 program, saying international peace and security
  required that it was not disrupted. The UK is the second-largest supplier of
  parts after the US. The UK government told a court that suspending exports to
  the F-35 program would have affected the battle to prevent Russia from
  occupying Ukraine, as the F-35 was a central pillar of Nato. The Australian
  government is required to make similar judgments before awarding export
  licences for parts used in the F-35. It must consider 12 criteria, including
  the balance between human rights concerns and national security and foreign
  policy considerations. What does the law say? Under the arms trade treaty,
  which Australia is a party to, providing weapons to a group involved in armed
  conflict can lead to criminal liability if the equipment is used to commit war
  crimes. In January last year, the international court of justice ruled the
  claim of genocide in Gaza was “plausible”. The Greens senator David Shoebridge
  says component parts are considered weapons and Australia is therefore
  breaching international law. But Donald Rothwell, an international law expert
  at the Australian National University, says he would “not be as decisive” as
  Shoebridge in his interpretation of international law. Rothwell said being
  definitive was difficult as “there can be so many component parts of weapons”.
  “Some component parts may have been exported to Israel for civilian use but
  then utilised for weapons,” Rothwell says. “I would take the view, though,
  that Australian exports that are component weapon parts, and which are
  exported to the IDF, are contributing to the Israeli military campaign in
  Gaza.” Paul told the ABC last week that Australia’s supply of components and
  parts to the F-35 fighter jets, which have been used by Israel, constitutes
  “directly the facilitation of war crimes”. During a recent court hearing, the
  UK government acknowledged its supply of F-35 components for potential use in
  Israel was in breach of its own arms export control laws. About 15% of the
  F-35’s parts, including ejection seats, are made in the UK. What do human
  rights groups say? The Australian Centre for International Justice, a
  non-profit legal centre, says Australia’s role in the supply chain “raises
  grave concerns that Australian parts and components are involved in the
  atrocities we have seen unfold in Gaza”. Amnesty International Australia’s
  Mohamed Duar has said “the lack of transparency surrounding Australia’s
  defence exports has made it extremely difficult to determine the extent of our
  involvement in the commission of genocide and war crimes”. Human Rights Watch
  was among 232 civil society organisations who urged nations involved in the
  F-35 supply chain to “immediately halt all arms transfers to Israel”. What
  does the Australian government say? Marles says Australia does not supply
  weapons to Israel and has complained about “misinformation” regarding exports,
  arguing it has “raised tensions in this country, which is deeply destabilising
  for Australia’s social cohesion”. Marles says Australia has contributed to the
  F-35 program for decades as part of a multi-lateral agreement with Lockheed
  Martin in the US, rather than Israel directly. On Friday, Michelle Rowland
  told ABC radio that she was confident Australia was meeting its obligations
  regarding defence approvals for the export of F-35 parts bound for Israel.
  “This is not a case of the Australian government supplying arms. We have taken
  [legal] advice, of which I’m not at liberty to disclose, but we have solid
  advice, and we always comply with our international obligations,” the attorney
  general said. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has described
  Australia’s contributions to the supply chain as “non-lethal in nature”.
