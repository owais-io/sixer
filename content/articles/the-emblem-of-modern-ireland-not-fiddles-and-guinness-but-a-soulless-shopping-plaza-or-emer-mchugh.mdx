  You wouldn’t know it to look at the tourist board ads, but the emblem of
  modern Ireland is probably a shopping centre. And now that emblem has found
  its bard, in the form of Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, the Irish pop star and
  songwriter better known as CMAT. She is a woman wielding a creative energy
  that is completely her own, but which is also profoundly shaped by her
  experiences coming of age in a post-Celtic tiger, recession-era Ireland. This
  has never been clearer than on her new single, Euro-Country, from the
  forthcoming album of the same name – a project that reminds us that pop
  culture has the power to illuminate political and social realities that are
  otherwise being ignored. It is the elegy that we, Ireland’s post-recession
  generation, needed – and it references at least two shopping centres. The
  Euro-Country album artwork is a send-up of Jean-Léon Gérôme’s painting Truth
  Coming Out of Her Well, with CMAT emerging from the fountain in Blanchardstown
  shopping centre, beside a giant euro coin. In an interview with the Guardian
  before her spectacular Glastonbury performance in June, Thompson observed that
  while Ireland is “a little more fetishised and trendy than it’s ever been”,
  it’s also “a really hard place to live, a really hard place to grow up, unless
  you have money, which we didn’t. So yeah, magical, beautiful, mystical
  Ireland: it’s a shopping centre – that’s what I grew up with.” And sure
  enough, the music video for the single is shot in the Omni retail park in the
  north Dublin suburbs, with CMAT dancing around the largely empty shopping
  centre and performing in a vacant shop display window. “Meet me behind the
  mall,” Taylor Swift once sang, with all of the American mystique that carries,
  but for Irish people, there is something distinctly soulless about an
  out-of-town shopping precinct in the post-recession era. It represents the
  hubris and corruption of the Celtic tiger bubble, and the struggles faced by
  Irish people in the years since it burst. It’s where everyone drives to get
  their groceries, of course – but it’s also a microcosm of the economic
  downturn in the last decade and a half. The YouTube comments on the music
  video show how much Thompson has struck a chord. Take one example:
  Euro-Country “isn’t just a song, it’s a reckoning … pulling people all over
  the world back to the Celtic tiger, forcing that history into the light again.
  CMAT has managed to give voice to a whole generation’s story.” Thompson dances
  in front of a branch of the clothing chain New Look, which went into
  liquidation in Ireland in February, and the bakery chain Thunders, which
  closed all its stores in March. The reality is that, post-2008, I do not know
  anyone in Ireland who has not struggled with money, been through lengthy
  periods of unemployment, or been forced to move back in with their parents (me
  included), thanks to catastrophically high rents. The statistics collected by
  Ireland’s Community Action Tenants Union (CATU) are damning: the number of
  homeless families increased by 232% between 2014 and 2021. Meanwhile, there
  are anywhere between 92,251 and 183,000 empty homes; while in the north, there
  are an estimated 20,000 empty homes. The choice for most people of my
  generation is either to emigrate, or to abandon the hope of ever being able to
  buy a house. This is the “Euro-Country” CMAT is honouring: modern Ireland,
  which she wrote is “the love of my life, the most toxic boyfriend I’ve ever
  had, the place which has changed so much that I feel sad every day I can’t
  return the version of it that is in my head”. The title track is a stirring
  but melancholic earworm, an elegy for a generation affected by recession and
  austerity. Hearing it randomly you could be forgiven for missing the scathing
  politics woven through the song. At least, until Euro-Country’s most
  devastating line. “I was 12 when the das started killing themselves all around
  me” is a shocking thing to hear in a pop song, but this is the Ireland that I
  know, this is the Ireland that many people of my generation know, and this is
  the Ireland that CMAT sings of. Having lost everything of monetary value in
  the crash, some also lost their loved ones to suicide; a 2015 National Suicide
  Research Foundation investigation found that there were 476 more male suicides
  than expected between 2008 and 2012. The economic crash in Ireland was caused
  by the global financial crisis, but it was also the product of unregulated
  greed and moneylending on the part of a small group of wealthy politicians,
  bankers and property developers. They get their own tribute in Euro-Country,
  with CMAT singing: “All the big boys, all the Berties / All the envelopes,
  yeah, they hurt me”. The Bertie in question is the former taoiseach and leader
  of Fianna Fáil Bertie Ahern, who resigned from his party in the wake of the
  Mahon tribunal’s 2008 conclusions that money from supporters had been
  deposited in his bank account. Political solutions to this malaise feel far
  away, especially as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have consistently been returned
  to government in every general election since the crash. It can be so easy to
  feel disillusioned and complacent, but I take heart from a key line in the
  bridge of Euro-Country: “I know it can be better if we hound it”. It makes me
  think of the rise of organisations such as CATU, branches of which have sprung
  up all over the island of Ireland to advocate for ordinary people’s housing
  rights: carrying out research on the housing crisis, providing support and
  solidarity for those facing illegal evictions, and organising large-scale
  protests. CMAT’s passionate, witty, defiant Euro-Country is part of that
  political milieu: it is a call to action to Irish people to reject the
  stranglehold of these parties, and to work towards better things together.
