webTitle: Shannon Sharpe reportedly out at ESPN after settlement of sexual assault suit

  Shannon Sharpe will not return to ESPN, ending the Pro Football Hall of
  Famer’s brief but high-profile run as a commentator on the network’s First
  Take sports-talk program. The decision comes less than two weeks after Sharpe
  settled a lawsuit filed by a former girlfriend who accused him of rape,
  allegations he forcefully denied. The Athletic was first to report the move on
  Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. ESPN declined to comment
  publicly, and no formal announcement has been made. Sharpe, 57, had not
  appeared on ESPN since late April, shortly after the suit was filed in Nevada.
  At the time, he called the accusations “false and disruptive” and said he
  expected to return in time for the start of NFL training camps. Instead, ESPN
  quietly opted to move on. The lawsuit, filed by a woman identified as Jane
  Doe, sought $50m in damages for what she described as “pain and suffering,
  psychological and emotional distress, mental anguish, embarrassment and
  humiliation”. Sharpe characterized the claims as a “shakedown”, maintaining
  that their sexual relationship had been consensual. The suit was dismissed
  with prejudice on 18 July following a private settlement. The woman’s
  attorney, Tony Buzbee, announced the resolution in a post on X, writing, “All
  matters have now been addressed satisfactorily, and the matter is closed.” A
  dismissal with prejudice means the same claim cannot be refiled in court. No
  criminal charges were filed against Sharpe. A three-time Super Bowl champion
  and four-time All-Pro, Sharpe retired in 2003 as the NFL’s all-time leader
  among tight ends in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. Since leaving
  football, he has become one of the most recognizable personalities in sports
  media, first as an analyst for CBS, then as co-host of Fox Sports 1’s
  Undisputed alongside Skip Bayless. After departing FS1 in 2023, Sharpe joined
  First Take as a twice-weekly sparring partner for Stephen A Smith. He also
  hosts two popular podcasts, Club Shay Shay and Nightcap with Ocho, the latter
  alongside former NFL receiver Chad Ochocinco. Both shows are currently
  distributed by The Volume, though that agreement is set to expire at the end
  of August. According to Front Office Sports and the Athletic, Sharpe was in
  talks for a major podcasting deal – potentially worth up to $100m – before the
  lawsuit became public. The status of those negotiations remains unclear.
