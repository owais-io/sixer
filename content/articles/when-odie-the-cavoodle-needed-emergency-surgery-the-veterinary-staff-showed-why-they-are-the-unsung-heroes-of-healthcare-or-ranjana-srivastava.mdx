  Speaking on a panel with me, a paediatric anaesthetist says that every time
  she takes a patient into theatre, she says to the parent, “I will take good
  care of your child.” Somehow, just imagining this solemn promise makes me
  tearful although I don’t even know that a variation of these words is headed
  my way. For the past week, our cavoodle Odie has been vomiting. The vet’s
  diagnosis of “it could be a stomach bug or lymphoma” is not exactly reassuring
  but, admittedly, the patient is wagging its tail. Two days later, our
  suspicion rises. The receptionist suggests I bring him in “now” for tests. I
  guiltily decline, loath to cancel my patients who have waited months to see
  me. Later, we go for an ultrasound and, as Odie burrows into my arms, his
  little heart thumps. Noticing his apprehension (and mine), the technician
  kneels, fusses over him before drawing him away. As I swallow the bill shock,
  I learn that Odie has swallowed something causing gastric obstruction. The
  waiting room has emptied but the vet does me the courtesy of asking me inside
  to advise that he will need emergency surgery. After texting the kids, I rush
  him to the animal hospital. In the rear view, he looks tired and innocent, and
  I feel remorseful. How did we fail him? The receptionist greets me with a
  fine-tuned amount of care and compassion. She neither indulges me nor fawns
  over my dog. This is not the time to tell me he is cute. Odie and I are
  nodding off when the duty vet calls us. Soon, she has me marvelling at her
  ability to be professional without patronising. She explains that I have a
  choice between attempting to retrieve the foreign body via a gastroscopy or
  moving straight to open surgery. Why not pick the less invasive option first,
  I ask, instinctively thinking about my patients. “Because if it fails, your
  cost doubles and some people can’t afford it.” This one-line informed
  financial consent hits the mark – but nauseous at the idea of cutting open
  Odie’s tiny abdomen, I opt for a gastroscopy and hope for the best. I ask the
  vet if I should wait only to be gently advised that the procedure requires
  prepping for hydration and sedation. Having sent countless patients for a
  gastroscopy, I feel stupid. A friendly nurse appears. Odie likes her, licks
  her and follows her to “the dog ward”, leaving me to pay the hefty deposit.
  This reminds me of my patients whose pension would foreclose this luxury on
  behalf of a pet that is often their sole companion. “Before you leave, do you
  want to see Odie?” the receptionist asks. I have decision fatigue – and say
  no, unconvincingly explaining that I don’t want to get his hopes up. “As you
  like,” she says. Recognising the politest of signals to guard against future
  regret, I stop at the door. “Do you think I should see him?” “Yeah.” The nurse
  brings out a still happy-looking Odie. I stroke his head, telling him (and me)
  that we are lucky to be in able hands. Meanwhile, my own hands feel awfully
  empty without dog or leash. My remedy to ward off the tears is to play loud
  Bollywood music and, while incongruous, it stops the sadness from invading my
  heart. At home, after answering my kids’ questions with “we don’t know” and
  “we can’t say”, I fall into an exhausted sleep. After midnight, an apologetic,
  frustrated vet calls to say that the gastroscopy was unsuccessful. She could
  see a twig-like object but couldn’t budge it. So I consent to an exploratory
  laparotomy, a term for opening up the abdomen that I have explained to many
  patients suffering from conditions that don’t involve a swallowed twig. A
  kindly surgeon assures me of the routine nature of the procedure. Eyeing the
  “for resuscitation” box, I hope so. The offender turns out to be the seed pod
  of a sweetgum tree. Odie comes home, a little dopey and nonplussed as to what
  the fuss is all about. As an oncologist, I am used to being compared
  (unfavourably) to vets. In the depth of their disappointments, patients and
  families will lament that they wouldn’t treat an animal “like that”. Of
  course, the human condition and human expectations are complicated, but I will
  say that vets and their staff might just be the unsung heroes of healthcare.
  They protect the interests of those who can’t even speak for themselves,
  comfortable both with curing and, when the suffering gets too much,
  palliating. All this without fanfare but with compassion and humility. What I
  will remember most is their empathy, which felt natural and unforced. They
  instinctively understood that they were treating two patients – me and my dog
  – and tailored their touch and talk accordingly. Alas, we don’t do this nearly
  well enough in medicine. The barrage of bureaucracy no doubt hardens us but,
  if we let our empathy dissipate, we will be the lesser for it. As for Odie,
  his wound is healing and he is inhaling our love. Considering the drama, I
  have a good mind to never again let him off leash. But, to be honest, at the
  first whiff of his eagerness to sniff at every blade of grass and inspect
  every dog’s behind, I will relent and, before I can exclaim “Don’t eat that!”,
  we will be back to our normal ways. • Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian
