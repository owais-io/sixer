  Financially beleaguered club Western United has had its licence withdrawn as
  part of Football Australia’s regulatory processes, a step which threatens the
  outfit’s existence just three years after it won the A-League Men
  championship. An independent board set up to assess each club against the
  licensing criteria decided on Thursday Western United has not met its
  requirements. It means the club – which is adamant the sale to US investors is
  imminent – is blocked from competing in FA-sanctioned competitions, including
  the A-Leagues. Football Australia issued a statement on Friday afternoon:
  “Football Australia is able to confirm that the first instance board [FIB] –
  an independent body established under the National Club Licensing Regulations
  – has convened and determined that Western United FC has failed to meet the
  criteria required to be granted an A-League licence. As such Western United
  FC’s licence has been withdrawn, effective immediately. In a statement the
  club said it was “bitterly disappointed by the decision” taken by FA and the
  FIB, and that it would be “exercising its right to appeal the decision with
  faith of a positive outcome as the sale of the club and injection of capital
  from [new investors] KAM Melbourne continues to progress”. The Australian
  Professional Leagues (APL) executive chair, Stephen Conroy, said his
  organisation awaits the outcome of the appeal process. “We’ve been advised by
  Football Australia on the determination by FIB to withdraw Western United’s
  conditional licence,” he said. “This is an FA, AFC and regulatory process, and
  we won’t comment further until the regulatory process and any appeal has been
  completed.” The licensing regulations are designed to “safeguard the
  credibility and integrity” of Australian football competitions and cover
  criteria such as financial standards. The initial deadline for clubs to comply
  was May, but FA was working with multiple clubs to help them meet the criteria
  until the amended deadline of 31 July. The board’s decision is based on
  documentation provided by Western United, along with recommendations from FA.
  Western United have been late in paying players this year and are currently
  subject to a Fifa-imposed transfer and registration ban. FA said the licensing
  process is designed to protect the game. “This outcome, while regrettable,
  reflects Football Australia’s ongoing commitment to upholding the integrity,
  stability, and fairness of competitions for all clubs, players, and
  stakeholders,” they said. The makeup of the FIB – set up for this licensing
  process – remains unclear, though its members are required to be independent
  from FA, the APL and clubs. The threat to the Tarneit’s outfit existence comes
  as owners seek to finalise a takeover by the US-based Kaminski group, which
  was announced in May. Western United only joined the A-Leagues in 2019 in its
  most recent round of expansion alongside Macarthur, which started a year
  later. Initially the project’s vision – of a club in a growth corridor that
  owned its own stadium, funded by a real estate development partnership with
  Wyndham City Council – was widely praised. Although the club has completed its
  training and office facilities at Ironbark Fields, a greenfields site in
  Tarneit where it holds most of its home matches, construction on the main
  stadium has been delayed. Wyndham City council’s director of corporate
  services, Mark Rossiter, said the news was disappointing particularly for fans
  but that ratepayers would not be affected by the situation. “We understand the
  club still has some appeal options and Wyndham will use that time to consider
  what this means for our partnership with Western Melbourne Group,” he said.
  “It is important to note that council and ratepayers are completely protected
  by the robust commercial and financial contracts that are in place between
  council and Western Melbourne Group. We continue to believe this is a unique
  initiative that has the potential to unlock an extraordinary level of public
  value, and we remain committed to realising this vision.” The men’s captain,
  Ben Garuccio, signed a new two-year deal last month, but was unable to play in
  the Australia Cup defeat to Sydney FC in late July due to the Fifa
  registration ban. A winding up process established by creditors of the club,
  including the tax office, is under way in the federal court. The club has
  outstanding debts of more than $16m. On Friday afternoon, the matter was
  adjourned until 28 August. Western United lodged its 2023-24 accounts with
  Asic last week, which showed a loss of $11m for the year and the value of its
  liabilities exceeding its assets by $55m. The coming A-League Men season is
  due to commence in late October.
