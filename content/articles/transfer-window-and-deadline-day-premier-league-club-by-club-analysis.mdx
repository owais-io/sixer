  Arsenal Andrea Berta’s first transfer window since taking over as sporting
  director has been busy. Headline moves for Viktor Gyökeres and Eberechi Eze
  have given Mikel Arteta the firepower and creativity he asked for, while
  Martín Zubimendi has added class to midfield. The arrival of Cristhian
  Mosquera, Christian Nørgaard, Noni Madueke and Kepa Arrizabalaga has also
  added depth to Arsenal’s squad that is already being called on after a series
  of early season injuries, while the late signing of the exciting Ecuador
  defender, Piero Hincapié, should prove to be a shrewd addition. Ed Aarons
  Aston Villa It has been a painfully slow start to the season and a strange
  summer. Villa retained their talented spine but struggled to enhance their
  squad until deadline day, with Harvey Elliott and Jadon Sancho joining on loan
  to give Unai Emery’s side much-needed fresh impetus. Both arrive with points
  to prove. Sancho is seen as a low-risk signing, similar to Marcus Rashford in
  January, but it has not been an entirely joined-up window. Evann Guessand made
  his first Villa start in Sunday’s collapse against Crystal Palace and Villa
  will hope he evolves into a key threat. Ben Fisher Bournemouth After losing
  four of their defensive mainstays from last season, it was hard to envisage
  Bournemouth emerging from the window in such a position of power. Not only
  have they generated £215m in sales but they have replaced key parts with
  minimal fuss. It has not been simple but Adrien Truffert and Bafodé Diakité,
  in particular, have slotted in seamlessly and there is excitement at the
  promise of Amine Adli, Ben Gannon Doak and Álex Jiménez, a deadline-day
  addition from Milan. Bournemouth consider Djordje Petrovic, a permanent No 1,
  a significant piece of business that will allow them to kick on under Andoni
  Iraola. BF Brentford The departures of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, who
  scored 39 of Brentford’s 66 Premier League goals last season, brought in more
  than £120m but have left a huge hole. Signing Reiss Nelson on loan from
  Arsenal represented an underwhelming end to the window for the new head coach,
  Keith Andrews, especially after deciding not to follow up a club-record £45m
  offer for Borussia Dortmund’s Max Beier that was rejected last week. The onus
  will be on Dango Ouattara – signed from Bournemouth for £42m – and Igor Thiago
  to provide the goals, while Jordan Henderson adds experience in midfield after
  the loss of the captain Christian Nørgaard. EA Brighton Most of the club’s
  business was done early as usual. Maxim De Cuyper was the last new arrival in
  the first week of July, the Belgium defender joining Olivier Boscagli,
  Charalampos Kostoulas, Diego Coppola and Tommy Watson at the Amex, while
  Stefanos Tzimas also arrived after signing in January. After seeing off strong
  interest in Carlos Baleba from Manchester United and selling João Pedro to
  Chelsea, it was a busy end to the window in terms of outgoings, with Tariq
  Lamptey, Abdallah Sima and Pervis Estupiñán among those departing. EA Burnley
  The revolving doors at Turf Moor kept spinning until the deadline. It was a
  hectic window as Burnley attempted to give themselves the strongest possible
  chance of staying up. The deadline-day arrival of the defensive midfielder
  Florentino Luís from Benfica, on loan but with an obligation to buy for £20.8m
  next summer, made it 14 incomings. That includes four of last season’s loanees
  being signed permanently. There were a staggering 19 departures, with the
  exits of CJ Egan-Riley, James Trafford and Josh Brownhill significant blows.
  Andy Hunter Chelsea Key business was completed early, with Liam Delap and João
  Pedro arriving to fire Enzo Maresca’s team to Club World Cup glory. Estêvão
  Willian is a sparkling addition on the right wing, replacing Noni Madueke.
  Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens are new arrivals on the opposite flank.
  Chelsea, who combined their expenditure with a lot of sales, did not pursue a
  new centre-back despite Levi Colwill’s knee injury and losing Delap to a
  hamstring injury led to confusion over Nicolas Jackson’s move to Bayern Munich
  before that was confirmed on deadline day. Maresca will hope Facundo
  Buonanotte, a surprise arrival on loan from Brighton, provides depth in
  attack. Jacob Steinberg Crystal Palace A chaotic end to the window summed up
  Palace’s summer as Marc Guéhi’s move to Liverpool was called off at the last
  minute after they failed to find an adequate replacement. It was a major
  victory for manager Oliver Glasner, having lost Eberechi Eze to Arsenal and
  having to wait for reinforcements due to uncertainty over the club’s European
  participation, while the chairman, Steve Parish, will be counting the cost of
  turning down £35m for a player with less than 12 months of his contract
  remaining. But at least Palace were able to add to their squad late on with
  the teenage French defender Jaydee Canvot joining on deadline day after they
  snapped up Spain forward Yeremy Pino from Villarreal. EA Everton David Moyes
  said from the outset that his mission to rebuild Everton could not be achieved
  in one window and he failed to hide his frustration at times as numerous
  targets rejected a move to Hill Dickinson Stadium. Ultimately, however, the
  club delivered. The squad remains light at full-back and in attack, but the
  signings of Jack Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Tyler Dibling represent a
  significant uplift in quality. They are the calibre of player that Moyes
  wanted. The deadline day capture of central midfielder Merlin Röhl from
  Freiburg addressed another problem area. AH Fulham Fulham’s only piece of
  business going into deadline day was for a No 2 keeper – Benjamin Lecomte.
  Marco Silva did not exactly hide his frustration. The Portuguese received a
  late boost, however, after Fulham completed the £34.5m signing of Brazilian
  winger Kevin from Shakhtar Donetsk after also agreeing a loan deal for Milan’s
  Samuel Chukwueze. Fulham also kept their tight-knit squad together. Andreas
  Pereira, who joined Palmeiras, was the only big-name player to depart. JS
  Leeds Daniel Farke has remodelled Leeds along taller and more powerful lines,
  but whether such newfound physicality translates into Premier League survival
  remains to be seen. Much hinges on the fitness of key attacking signings
  Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha. Can they remain sufficiently
  injury-free to showcase their very real talent? Only time will tell if Patrick
  Bamford’s attacking skills were jettisoned too quickly. Midfield seems to have
  been fortified sensibly by the addition of Sean Longstaff and Anton Stach,
  while Lucas Perri promises to prove the reliable goalkeeper Farke has long
  craved and Jaka Bijol offers necessary competition in central defence. Louise
  Taylor Liverpool An outstanding window before deadline day was upgraded to
  sensational by close of play. The champions had clear, ambitious priorities
  from the start and acquired almost every one in a lavish recruitment drive
  that leaves Arne Slot with a more formidable squad than he had last season.
  Having played Newcastle all summer, Liverpool finally landed Alexander Isak
  for a British record fee of £125m – £25m below Newcastle’s valuation – but a
  £35m move for Marc Guéhi was thwarted late on. The sale of squad players for
  high prices, along with the benefits of being a sensible and well-run club,
  helped fund an outlay in excess of £440m. AH Manchester City Tijjani
  Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Aït-Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli arrived early,
  with the first three involved in a start to the season that has seen City lose
  two of their opening three fixtures. This suggests the club’s recruitment may
  be going awry. Their arrivals were followed by thearrival of Gianluigi
  Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain, a standout addition but also a curious
  one given the Italian can be clumsy with his feet – a head-scratcher as
  “Guardiola-ball” hinges on the keeper being slick in this area. Ederson has
  departed to join Fenerbahce. Jamie Jackson Manchester United Manchester United
  entered the window needing one No 10 and ended up with two – Matheus Cunha and
  Bryan Mbeumo. They needed at least one midfielder – a No 6 – and ended up with
  none. They also needed an elite goalkeeper and signed a 23-year-old prospect
  in Senne Lammens, albeit there is a belief at Old Trafford that he can
  challenge André Onana and Altay Bayindir for the No 1 spot immediately. United
  did land the No 9 they wanted in Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig but, overall,
  this has been an odd window for the 20-times champions. JJ Newcastle A
  turbulent, unedifying summer on Tyneside dominated by Alexander Isak’s
  ultimately satisfied desperation to leave for Liverpool has, on paper,
  actually ended rather well for Newcastle. Nick Woltemade – AKA “the two-metre
  Messi” – and Yoane Wissa may yet turn out to be a better attacking duo than
  Isak and Callum Wilson. Similarly, Aaron Ramsdale’s loan arrival offers Nick
  Pope real goalkeeping competition, Malick Thiaw strengthens the central
  defensive department, Jacob Ramsey adds midfield quality and versatility and
  Anthony Elanga is a high-calibre winger. LT Nottingham Forest There is so much
  to like about Forest’s business but recruitment, overseen by Edu, the global
  head of football for Evangelos Marinakis’s stable of clubs, is also behind the
  friction with Nuno Espírito Santo. Only one of Forest’s new faces, Dan Ndoye,
  a £34m buy from Bologna, started Sunday’s defeat by West Ham and Nuno would
  have preferred all 11 signings to have been embedded during pre-season. No
  fewer than four arrived from Botafogo, including the left-back Cuiabano and
  the goalkeeper John Victor. Nuno counts last summer’s preparations as a driver
  behind their historic season. BF Sunderland Sunderland have not quite eclipsed
  Nottingham Forest’s record of signing 21 new players in a single window but
  Regis Le Bris’s squad has certainly been refreshed. If turning Enzo Le Fée’s
  January loan from Roma into a formal transfer was a triumph, the arrival of
  the impressive Netherlands Under-21 goalkeeper Robin Roefs, the Switzerland
  captain and former Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka and the former Strasbourg
  midfielder Habib Diarra look three more terrific deals. At the last count, Le
  Bris had overseen the arrival of 14 new faces for a combined £141.5m this
  summer. Retaining squad harmony amid such wholesale change is vital but, if
  Sunderland stay up, the investments will look shrewd. LT Tottenham When James
  Maddison ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season against
  Newcastle on 3 August, Tottenham’s need for a new playmaker became desperate.
  Dejan Kulusevski was already a long-term injury casualty. So there was anxiety
  when the club failed with moves for Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze. The
  capture of Xavi Simons, then, brought relief as well as excitement. Mohammed
  Kudus had arrived earlier to plug the gap left by Son Heung-min’s departure,
  while João Palhinha reinforces the base of the midfield. Randal Kolo Muani
  will provide a needed extra option up front as the club prepare for the
  demands of a Champions League return. David Hytner West Ham Forced to sell in
  order to buy, West Ham were unable to do anything before Mohammed Kudus joined
  Spurs for £54.5m. The attacker’s departure heaped pressure on the club’s
  unpopular board. There was cautious optimism when deals for Mads Hermansen,
  Callum Wilson, Kyle Walker-Peters and El Hadji Malick Diouf went through, but
  the pressure rose when a dreadful start to the season exposed gaps in
  midfield. Then the mood lifted, Edson Álvarez’s exit making room for West Ham
  to sign Mateus Fernandes and Soungoutou Magassa. However they encountered
  frustration with their attempts to sign a centre-back on loan to replace Nayef
  Aguerd, who followed Emerson Palmieri to Marseille on deadline day. JS Wolves
  Retaining Jørgen Strand Larsen amid sustained interest from Newcastle was a
  victory for the chairman, Jeff Shi, a target for criticism among supporters.
  Shi personally informed Strand Larsen, who only joined permanently in July,
  that he would be staying put despite Newcastle’s interest. Better still,
  Wolves finally have another forward option after a £24m deal for Genk’s Tolu
  Arokodare. Offloading Fábio Silva and Gonçalo Guedes was also a significant
  step, but it is difficult to argue Wolves have done sufficient business to
  avoid another season of struggle after the sales of Matheus Cunha and Rayan
  Aït-Nouri. Vítor Pereira wanted three signings before the deadline and there
  is only one piece missing – a midfielder. BF
