  There is something ever so slightly Martin Parr-like about this documentary,
  filmed inside a shabby rundown health resort near Odesa, in Ukraine. It’s not
  the colour palette, which is Soviet-era pale beige, but the images of
  holidaymakers: elderly men strutting about in thongs and playing ping pong in
  their vests; retirees of both sexes glad-ragged at the disco. Like Parr’s
  photos, the images are funny but not unkind; everyone retains their dignity.
  The director is Irish film-maker Gar O’Rourke, who planned Sanatorium before
  the war, but filmed it after Russia invaded Ukraine, which adds a layer of
  melancholy to the guests’ search for health and happiness. The huge Kuyalnik
  sanatorium is a time warp with its brutalist architecture and institutional
  interiors. Back in its glory days, people must have come here in their
  thousands. Now, the place is a little tired: paint peeling off the walls, the
  ceilings stained by leaks. The health treatments too have a retro feel: mud
  wraps and electro massage machines. One guest is Natalia, who has brought her
  single 40-ish son Andriy, hoping to find him a wife. That doesn’t look
  promising since most of the other guests look old enough to have visited the
  sanatorium back in the day. Mother and son give the film a lovely moment slow
  dancing together to George Michael’s Careless Whisper at the disco. Other
  stories emerge: one woman’s husband was killed on the frontline; a younger
  guest is a soldier recovering from injuries sustained on the frontline.
  Another woman is here for help with fertility. The place is run by the Tony
  Soprano of hospitality, Dmitriy, a great wardrobe of man who walks around
  shouting at staff. He is under pressure: the Russians are shelling Odesa and
  the air raid sirens are going off, visitor numbers are down, guests are glued
  to their phones, checking the news and apps monitoring drones and missiles.
  Their resilience is heroic, and there is a very moving scene near the end
  during a recital of the national anthem; so many faces with tears, each
  registering a loss or struggle. • Sanatorium is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5
  September.
