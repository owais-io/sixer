  “We expect the usual offender apologists to criticise our efforts”. So said
  the Northern Territory’s chief minister, Lia Finocchiaro, in an Instagram post
  this week announcing her Country Liberal party government’s newest changes to
  the NT’s youth justice laws since coming to power in August. The most
  notorious among the CLP’s third set of amendments to youth justice laws in
  under a year is the reintroduction of spit hoods, now to be called “anti-spit
  guards”, into youth detention centres including Don Dale. Spit hoods became
  emblematic of what a royal commission found in August 2016 was a system in
  which children were verbally and physically abused and humiliated contrary to
  international law in prison-like youth detention centres that were unfit for
  accommodating children, let alone rehabilitating them. Among the critics of
  the reintroduction of “anti-spit guards” have been Mindy Sotiri, executive
  director of the Justice Reform Initiative; Karly Warner, the chair of the
  National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services; and the NT’s
  own children’s commissioner, Shahleena Musk. Are these leaders “offender
  apologists”? Finocchiaro wants to cast the CLP’s critics as people who are
  somehow accepting of terrible violence. In the same Instagram post,
  Finocchiaro justified these latest changes – which also include lowering the
  bar before force is used against children in detention, and broadening the
  kinds of force that can be used to include dogs – by referring to a shocking
  incident last weekend in which a 15-year-old boy was stabbed at the Royal
  Darwin Show. The CLP’s pattern is now clear. The opposition leader, NT Labor’s
  Selena Uibo, called the newest amendments a “reactive, knee-jerk response”.
  But it’s more likely that they’ve sat in Finocchiaro’s “to be actioned” tray
  for some time. It takes time to draft laws, and these latest changes appeared
  just three days after the Royal Show. In its first sitting week after
  returning to power, the CLP lowered the age of criminal responsibility back
  down to 10. And following a horrific home invasion, the CLP immediately
  tightened bail laws. Rather than rushed and kneejerk, the CLP’s trilogy of
  amendments to youth justice laws have been patient and opportunistic. They are
  consistent with an ideological opposition among many detention centre staff
  and corrections and police officers to the changes demanded by the royal
  commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern
  Territory. Most youth crime is committed by a relatively small number of
  children, some of whom commit an enormous number of offences. Evidence, in the
  form of research into this small cohort of repeat offenders and why they
  behave as they do, supports targeted, therapeutic approaches that aim to
  address underlying reasons and causes. The overwhelming majority of kids who
  offend have led extraordinarily traumatic lives. Often, they were victims of
  serious abuse and neglect long before they began breaking and entering, or
  hurting people. The evidence shows that reacting to these kids’ bad behaviour
  with violence (or “force”) and aggression simply heaps more trauma on existing
  trauma – and makes it more likely that the offending behaviour escalates
  rather than resolves. People like Sotiri, Warner and Musk accept this evidence
  base. The reason they’re critical of laws that authorise reactive force rather
  than encourage therapeutic intervention is that they know such laws will only
  make the existing problem worse. But therapeutic intervention just doesn’t
  exist, even when it’s been court-ordered. When children who have been
  traumatised inside detention centres are released, they will be more, not
  less, likely to commit further offences. In stark terms: there will be more
  victims as a result of the CLP’s policies. But the people who accept this
  evidence base are not the CLP’s constituents. During the last decade,
  non-Labor parties across the country have discovered a growing appetite among
  communities of resentment – fuelled by online echo-chambers and shock-jock
  opinionistas – for reactionary approaches that get tougher and tougher on
  criminalised kids, and that blame what it calls “soft” approaches by
  governments more interested in the evidence. (Finocchiaro herself talks about
  the “soft, offender-first policies” of her Labor predecessors.) The CLP was
  the first to ride this wave of reaction into power. The Liberal National Party
  in Queensland was the second, in October, by promising what it called “adult
  crime, adult time”. Ironically, most of this crime is more accurately
  characterised as juvenile, in the sense that it’s perpetrated by kids and
  young adults with damaged or under-developed pre-frontal cortexes. But it’s
  politics and ideology, not evidence, that guide what we might call the
  “Northern approach” to youth crime, following the united approach announced by
  Finocchiaro and Queensland’s police minister, Dan Purdie, after he visited
  Darwin this month. No doubt we haven’t seen the last of its regressions.
