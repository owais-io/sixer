  Kevin Njoroge*, a worker on a flower farm in the Kenyan lakeside town of
  Naivasha, was making his way back home from his shift last month when he was
  surrounded by police officers, arrested and thrown in prison. He usually got
  the bus home, but because of protests taking place that day across the
  country, including in Navaisha, 55 miles (90km) east of Nairobi, he had to
  walk. The demonstrations were to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Saba
  Saba (7/7) protests that took place in 1990 and which ended Daniel arap Moi’s
  autocratic 24-year reign. “When I got close to my neighbourhood in Kihoto
  estate, some police officers found me and arrested me along with others. They
  were picking anybody they saw off the streets and arresting them,” he says.
  The next day, Njoroge was brought to court and charged with robbery with
  violence and given bail of 200,000 Kenyan shillings (£1,160) – more than 16
  times his monthly salary. Neither he nor his family could pay it so he was
  taken to prison. “My mother and brother tried their best to raise money for me
  but they couldn’t. So I was sent to the remand prison, which was already
  overcrowded and meant that it was hard to get things like food or even a place
  to sleep,” he says. He was released on 21 July after his brother managed to
  crowdfund his bail, which had been reduced to KSh50,000. “For a moment I
  thought I’d spend the rest of my life in jail yet I had done nothing wrong,”
  he says. “I worry for many of the other young men I left behind in prison.
  Many of them don’t have any means of getting out.” Njoroge was one of nearly
  1,500 Kenyans arrested and charged after the nationwide 7 July protests.
  Announcing the arrests, Kenya’s interior minister, Kipchumba Murkomen,
  described the protesters as “marauding gangs of looters and barefaced
  anarchists”. Data shared with the Guardian from the Police Reforms Working
  Group, a civil society coalition focused on strengthening oversight and the
  rule of law, documents 316 such arrests. The majority are of men below the age
  of 25. Of the 316, 70% – or 221 of those arrested – have been charged with
  terrorism, robbery with violence, theft and arson – offences that carry high
  bail conditions of up to KSh1,000,000. Legal experts say that charging people
  with such offences indicates a shift in tactics by the Kenyan authorities to a
  new form of state repression that relies on the law to silence dissent. Mwaura
  Kabata, vice-president of the Law Society of Kenya, says: “This is ‘lawfare’.
  The government is weaponising existing acts of parliament as well as trying to
  introduce new ones, such as the assembly and demonstration bill, in order to
  address both offline and online dissent. “In 2024, many of the cases that were
  prosecuted against protesters were dropped and so the government is using more
  punitive laws,” he says. Kabata argues that the government’s actions will have
  a chilling effect on Kenyans’ ability to demonstrate because of how punitive,
  vague and expansive the charges are. “This is just as much about the message
  as it is about the process,” he says. “It’s a kneejerk reaction from the
  government, which saw these protests getting out of hand. Its main intent is
  to silence dissent.” Vincent Chahale, country director of the International
  Justice Mission – Kenya (IJM), says the use of these laws against protesters
  at this scale is new. Last year they were mostly charged with unlawful
  assembly, creating disturbance and damage to property. “One emergent thing
  witnessed in the recent past is the charging of some protesters with offences
  under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. This is unprecedented. “The
  disadvantage to the protesters is that the bail terms would be high as opposed
  to if they had been charged with normal offences under the penal code,” says
  Chahale. Kabata believes the government was testing the waters earlier in the
  year when it used the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act in several cases. In
  January, Jackson Kuria, a prison officer turned activist known as “Cop
  Shakur”, was charged with publishing false information linking state officials
  to the abduction of government critics. In May, a software developer, Rose
  Njeri, was arrested in Nairobi for launching an email automation tool that
  allowed citizens to submit objections to the finance bill more easily. In the
  same month, four film-makers were arrested after the state linked them to the
  BBC World Service documentary Blood Parliament. Kabata says: “If they’re able
  to weaponise the cybercrimes law then definitely they’ll try to replicate this
  with as many other laws as they can.” Kenya’s director of public prosecutions
  (DPP), Renson Ingonga, has defended his office’s decision to press such
  charges against protesters, arguing that they were justified and not
  politically motivated. In an interview with local media, Ingonga said: “The
  ODPP [Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions] doesn’t work under
  anybody’s direction. We make our own decisions based on the law and evidence
  available.” Addressing the particular use of terrorism charges against
  protesters, even for “vandalism”, he added:“Terrorism is not only when you use
  bombs or guns … any act against government installations is an act of
  terrorism.” Kenya’s Judicial Service Commission also defended the bail and
  bond terms imposed on protesters, saying that they were informed by the
  constitution, the criminal procedure code and the judiciary’s bail and bond
  policy guidelines. But Kenya’s civil society and human rights organisations
  and legal professionals are sounding the alarm about what they see as “the
  weaponisation of the criminal justice system”. Several lawyers have offered
  their services for free to those who were imprisoned and a fundraising
  campaign has been launched to help secure bail for detainees. But Kabata says
  that freeing protesters and others caught in the government’s dragnet will not
  be enough as the charges will have seriously damaging consequences. “We’ll
  have to work to get these [criminal] records expunged,” he says. “These
  charges have lasting effects on people and will affect their future.
  Terrorism, for example, is a crime that is recognised both locally and
  internationally.” * A pseudonym has been used to protect his identity.
