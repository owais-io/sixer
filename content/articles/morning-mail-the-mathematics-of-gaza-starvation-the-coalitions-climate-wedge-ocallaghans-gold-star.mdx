  Morning everyone. Our top story suggests the Coalition’s internal tensions
  will not end any time soon, with one MP warning the opposition will lose even
  more voters if it continues to backslide on policies for net zero by 2050. We
  have another exclusive story about the dengue outbreak on Nauru and the
  Productivity Commission is calling for massive tax cuts – for companies.
  Elsewhere, a very powerful dispatch from our chief Middle East correspondent
  shows how Israel has calibrated the famine in Gaza; and in swimming, Mollie
  O’Callaghan has equalled Ian Thorpe’s gold haul. Australia Exclusive | At
  least nine asylum seekers on Nauru have contracted dengue fever amid an
  outbreak on the island, including one man who was medically evacuated to
  Australia for treatment and then returned this week, according to a legal aid
  group and an asylum seeker there. Exclusive | One of the Liberal party’s two
  surviving inner-metropolitan MPs has warned voters see the Coalition as not
  being serious about tackling climate change, prompted by former Nationals
  leader Barnaby Joyce’s private member’s bill to overturn net zero. Tax call |
  In an “ambitious” Productivity Commission proposal aimed at boosting
  investment and revitalising the country’s flagging productivity, the company
  tax rate would be slashed to 20% for all but the very biggest businesses.
  Spying game | Public servants and private contractors with access to sensitive
  national security information such as the Aukus submarine project are making
  it easy for spies to target their work, including by posting on sites such as
  LinkedIn, Australia’s spy chief has warned. Ban explainer | The Albanese
  government is leading the world with its attempts to ban under-16s from social
  media sites but it still remains unclear how the ban will be enforced and
  which platforms will be exempt. World ‘Mathematics of starvation’ | At least
  91 people have been killed and 600 wounded while waiting for aid in Gaza over
  the last 24 hours, as the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, visits Israel for ceasefire
  discussions. In a special report, our correspondent Emma Graham Harrison
  examines the “mathematics of starvation” and how Israel has caused the famine
  ravaging the territory. Canada’s trade deal | Donald Trump has threatened
  Canada after it moved to recognise a Palestinian state, reacting to Mark
  Carney’s announcement by saying that signing a US trade deal would now be
  “very hard”. Follow the news live from Washington. ‘Transnational repression’
  | A former Hong Kong politician and prominent democracy campaigner has accused
  British police of asking her to “self-censor” after she was targeted by
  suspected “transnational repression” from China. The case mirrors the
  targeting of a Melbourne-based activist in the same way. $4tn mark | Microsoft
  soared past US$4tn in market valuation overnight, becoming the second publicly
  traded company after Nvidia to surpass the milestone. ‘Oldest baby’ | The
  world’s “oldest baby” has been born in the US from an embryo that was frozen
  in 1994, it has been reported. Full Story Newsroom edition: when will
  Australia recognise Palestine? Reged Ahmad talks to deputy editor Patrick
  Keneally and head of newsroom Mike Ticher about the pressure pushing Australia
  towards Palestinian recognition. In-depth Traders in a pocket of suburban
  Melbourne long known as Little India say their livelihoods and heritage are
  under threat from plans to redevelop the precinct for apartments, shops and
  offices. The council promises that shopkeepers will be given the chance to
  stay in the colourful corner of Dandenong, but business owners tell Adeshola
  Ore they fear being priced out. “They’re selling it as a Little India,” one
  says. “But they want to make it like Bourke Street.” Not the news Georgia Maq,
  the singer who fronted the all-female band Camp Cope until they split two
  years ago, is back with a new EP after moving to Los Angeles to find a
  “different life for myself”. She talks to Brodie Lancaster about making the
  new record, her intense times in the band and the possibility of being cast in
  a “chaotic and insane” film role. Sport Swimming | Mollie O’Callaghan (above,
  farthest right) has equalled Ian Thorpe’s Australian record for world
  championship golds after anchoring the women’s team to victory in the 4x200m
  freestyle relay in Singapore. Rugby union | Lions coach Andy Farrell has
  described suggestions the Wallabies are not worthy opponents for future tours
  as “insulting” as he hopes to inspire his players to a series clean sweep in
  Sydney tomorrow night. Cricket | England had the better of a rain-interrupted
  first day in the fifth Test against India, with the visitors reaching 204 for
  six from 64 overs at the close. Media roundup Queensland is not ruling out a
  total ban on e-bikes and e-scooters, the ABC reports. According to the
  Australian, the Coalition is also facing internal pressure over its messaging
  on Israel. What’s happening today North-east Arnhem land | The Garma
  festival’s 25th anniversary kicks off today, running until Monday. Sydney |
  Palestine Action Group will challenge the police decision to block Harbour
  Bridge protest in supreme court. Queensland | A parliament estimates hearings
  will be held. Sign up If you would like to receive this Morning Mail update to
