  The heatwave-fuelled wildfires that have killed two people in Spain over
  recent days, devouring thousands of hectares of land and forcing thousands of
  people from their homes, are a “clear warning” of the impact of the climate
  emergency, the country’s environment minister has said. Speaking on Wednesday
  morning, as firefighters in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean countries
  continued to battle dozens of blazes, Sara Aagesen said the 14 wildfires still
  burning across seven Spanish regions were further proof of the country’s
  particular vulnerability to global heating. Aagesen said that while some of
  the fires appeared to have been started deliberately, the deadly blazes were a
  clear indicator of the climate emergency and of the need for better
  preparation and prevention. “The fires are one of the parts of the impact of
  that climate change, which is why we have to do all we can when it comes to
  prevention,” she told Cadena Ser radio. “Our country is especially vulnerable
  to climate change. We have resources now but, given that the scientific
  evidence and the general expectation point to it having an ever greater
  impact, we need to work to reinforce and professionalise those resources.” The
  Spanish government on Wednesday said it has asked the European Union for its
  help, in particular for two water-bombing planes. “We officially asked
  tonight” for the assistance, interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told
  Cadena Ser. Aagesen’s comments came a day after temperatures in parts of
  southern Spain surged past 45C (113F). The state meteorological office, Aemet,
  said there were no recorded precedents for the temperatures experienced
  between 1 August and 20 August. A 35-year-old volunteer firefighter died on
  Tuesday in the north-western Spanish region of Castilla y León, where fires
  have prompted the evacuation of more than 8,000 residents, and where seven
  people are being treated in hospital for serious burns. Four are in a critical
  condition. The firefighter’s death came hours after that of a 50-year-old man
  who suffered 98% burns while trying to save horses from a burning stable near
  Madrid on Monday night. By Wednesday morning, the Madrid fire had been brought
  under control, but blazes in the far north-western region Galicia had consumed
  11,500 hectares (30,000 acres) of land by the end of the day. “Emergency teams
  are continuing to fight fires across our country,” the prime minister, Pedro
  Sánchez, said in a post on X on Wednesday. “The fire situation remains serious
  and extreme caution is essential. My thanks, once again, to all of you who are
  working tirelessly to fight the flames.” Neighbouring Portugal deployed more
  than 2,100 firefighters and 20 aircraft against five big blazes, with efforts
  focused on a fire in the central municipality of Trancoso that has raged since
  Saturday. Strong gusts of wind had rekindled flames overnight and threatened
  nearby villages, where television images showed local people volunteering to
  help firefighters under a thick cloud of smoke. In Greece, which requested EU
  aerial assistance on Tuesday, close to 5,000 firefighters were battling blazes
  fanned by gale-force winds nationwide. Authorities said emergency workers were
  waging a “a titanic battle” to douse flames still raging through the western
  Peloponnese, in Epirus farther north, and on the islands of Zakynthos,
  Kefalonia and Chios, where thousands of residents and tourists have been
  evacuated from homes and hotels. Local media reported the wildfires had
  decimated houses, farms and factories and forced people to flee. Fifteen
  firefighters and two volunteers had suffered burns and other injuries
  including “symptoms of heatstroke”, the fire service said. Around midnight a
  huge blaze erupted on Chios, devouring land that had only begun to recover
  from devastating wildfires in June. As the flames reached the shores, the
  coastguard rushed to remove people on boats to safety. On the other side of
  Greece, outside the western city of Patras, volunteers with the Hellenic Red
  Cross struggled to contain infernos barrelling towards villages and towns. By
  lunchtime on Wednesday, media footage showed flames on the outskirts of
  Patras, Greece’s third-largest city. Municipal authorities announced a shelter
  had been set up to provide refuge, food and water for those in need. Officials
  evacuated a children’s hospital and a retirement home in the city as a
  precaution, and local media footage showed the roof of a 17th-century
  monastery outside the city on fire. Seventeen settlements around Preveza,
  where fires broke out Tuesday, were reported to be without electricity or
  water. “Today is also expected to be very difficult as in most areas of the
  country a very high risk of fire is forecast,” a fire service spokesperson,
  Vassilis Vathrakoyiannis, said in a televised address. “By order of the head
  of the fire brigade, all services nationwide, including civil protection
  forces, will be in a state of alert.” At first light, 33 water-dumping planes
  and helicopters scrambled to extinguish fires, he said. Temperatures exceeding
  35C (95F) are predicted, according to some meteorologists, to rise further
  later this week, the height of the summer for Greeks. Record heat and
  prolonged drought have already turned much of the country tinder-dry,
  producing conditions ripe for forest fires. A forestry worker was killed on
  Wednesday while responding to a wildfire in southern Turkey, officials said.
  The forestry ministry said the worker died in an accident involving a fire
  truck that left four others injured. Turkey has been battling severe wildfires
  since late June. A total of 18 people have been killed, including 10 rescue
  volunteers and forestry workers who died in July. In southern Albania a
  wildfire caused explosions after detonating buried second world war-era
  artillery shells. Officials said on Wednesday an 80-year-old man had died in
  one blaze south of the capital, Tirana. The Associated Press and Agence
  France-Presse contributed to this report
