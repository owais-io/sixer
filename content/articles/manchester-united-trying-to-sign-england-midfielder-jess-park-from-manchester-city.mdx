  Manchester United are exploring a move to sign the England midfielder Jess
  Park from Manchester City before the Women’s Super League transfer window
  shuts on Thursday, the Guardian can reveal. Park has been with City for eight
  years. She made her debut as a 16-year-old in 2017, was part of the Lionesses
  squad that lifted the Euro 2025 title in Switzerland this summer and has been
  a key player for her club for several seasons. Park was part of the side that
  won the FA Cup in 2020 and played in 21 of her club’s 22 league games last
  term as they finished fourth. The 23-year-old has 20 England caps and has
  scored three international goals, including the winner against the world
  champions, Spain, in a Nations League fixture at Wembley in February. The WSL
  transfer window closes at 11pm BST on Thursday and a large number of deals are
  being worked on, including several high-profile and potentially big-money
  moves. London City Lionesses are understood to be close to signing the Spain
  youth international Lucía Corrales from Barcelona, after meeting her release
  clause of about €500,000 (£435,000). If personal terms are agreed, that would
  make her the fourth-most expensive signing in WSL history so far, and a record
  sale for a Spanish player. The 19-year-old, who spent last season on loan at
  Sevilla, scored the winning goal in the semi-final of the 2022 Under-17 World
  Cup against Germany, with Spain going on to win the final. She was one of the
  first female footballers to live at Barcelona’s La Masia training base and the
  Spanish club released a statement on Monday confirming that Corrales’s buyout
  clause had been met by an unnamed club. Leicester City are hoping to sign the
  Australia midfielder Emily van Egmond from Birmingham City. Leicester are
  managerless but multiple sources have confirmed that the former West Ham
  assistant coach Rick Passmoor has taken interim charge.
