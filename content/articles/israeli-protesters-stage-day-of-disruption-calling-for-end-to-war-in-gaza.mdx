  Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations across Israel on
  Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that aimed to push
  Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and calling off plans
  to attack Gaza City. Relatives of hostages led the biggest march and rally in
  Tel Aviv, while in Jerusalem hundreds of people gathered outside the prime
  minister’s office as the security cabinet met to discuss the war. There were
  dozens of other protests around the country, including on the main highway to
  the northern city of Haifa and inside Ben Gurion airport. Israel’s military
  has been ordered to speed up preparations for a ground offensive in Gaza City,
  even as mediators say they are waiting for Israel’s response to a ceasefire
  agreement already on the table. Netanyahu has shrugged off warnings that
  attacking Gaza City would be catastrophic for Palestinians struggling to
  survive a famine, and dangerous for about 20 hostages thought to still be
  alive. No decision about the Gaza City campaign was reached at Tuesday’s
  cabinet meeting, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported, amid intense global
  anger over a strike on a hospital that killed 20 people, among them five
  journalists. Qatar’s foreign ministry called on Israel to respond to the
  ceasefire and hostage release deal for Gaza, which has been accepted by Hamas
  and reflects previous Israeli demands. “Attempts to stall by shifting
  locations or other tactics are clear to the international community, and it is
  time for Israel to give a serious answer to what it has already agreed to in
  the past,” the ministry’s spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said. A majority of
  Israelis back ending the war as part of a ceasefire deal to free all remaining
  hostages, a sentiment mostly driven by concerns about hostages still in Gaza
  and the impact of two years of war on Israeli society and its economy. Most
  protests include some demonstrators calling for an end to famine and the
  slaughter of Palestinians, but they are usually a tiny minority. Polling this
  week showed that nearly three-quarters of Jewish Israelis partially or totally
  agree with the claim made by Israel’s government that “there are no innocents
  in Gaza”. Earlier this month, another survey found 78% of Jewish Israelis said
  they were “not so troubled” or “not troubled” at all by reports of Palestinian
  suffering. Netanyahu is under pressure from far-right parties propping up his
  fragile coalition government who say they will quit if he agrees a ceasefire
  deal. Critics, including relatives of hostages in Gaza, say he is prolonging
  the war to extend his personal political career. “We could have ended the war
  a year ago and brought all the hostages and soldiers home. We could have saved
  hostages and soldiers, but the prime minister chose, again and again, to
  sacrifice civilians for the sake of his rule,” said Einav Zangauker, whose
  25-year-old son Matan is still in Gaza. The prime minister says military force
  is the best way to protect Israel’s security and put pressure on Hamas to
  release the remaining hostages. Some protesters said they had little hope
  Netanyahu would change course but wanted to stand up against his policies,
  including Ada Gorni, 88, protesting with her daughter Carmen, who was carrying
  a sign saying “Enough” in Arabic, English and Hebrew. “We just want to stop
  the war, bring home the hostages and stop the starvation in Gaza,” said
  Carmen, 58. “I think we have to say it out loud, but I don’t think they are
  listening to us.”
