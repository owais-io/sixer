  A nationally significant water shortfall is gripping England, the government
  has warned, as experts say the conditions could last until mid-autumn. The
  National Drought Group met to discuss actions to save water across the
  country, and Steve Reed, the environment secretary, briefed the chancellor of
  the duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden, about the risks posed by the dry
  weather. Water companies are preparing to take more drastic measures to
  conserve water as supplies dwindle. Southern Water, some of whose customers
  are already under a hosepipe ban, has applied for a non-essential use ban that
  would prohibit businesses from taking actions such as filling swimming pools
  or cleaning their windows. The company has also applied for an emergency order
  to take water from a rare chalk stream after it drops below its ecologically
  safe water flow. The drought is hitting many sectors across the country, with
  many canals shut to navigation due to low water levels, farmers struggling to
  grow crops and feed livestock, and higher numbers of fish die-offs being
  reported by anglers and others who use England’s rivers. Two rivers, the Wye
  and the Great Ouse at Ely, were at their lowest on record for July, and only
  89% of long-term average rainfall was recorded for the month across England.
  This is the sixth consecutive month of below-average rainfall. Five areas of
  England are in drought: Yorkshire; Cumbria and Lancashire; Greater Manchester,
  Merseyside and Cheshire; East Midlands; and West Midlands. Dry conditions
  could last well into October, the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology has
  warned, which would put higher pressure on water supplies as rivers,
  reservoirs and aquifers are at very low points after a very dry spring and
  summer. Its latest hydrological outlook says: “Normal to below normal
  groundwater levels are likely to persist through both August and the
  August-October period.” It added the situation would continue for “low river
  flows across central and southern England”. More parts of the country could be
  at risk of being plunged into drought conditions as aquifers are depleted.
  These are underground stores of water which take a long time, and a lot of
  sustained rainfall, to recharge. These were full after a very wet winter in
  2024 and the start of 2025, but the dry conditions have caused them to become
  depleted. At the moment, it is mainly areas reliant on reservoirs and chalk
  streams that are facing drought and hosepipe bans, as areas such as London
  have been able to use the resources from the chalk aquifer. The hydrological
  forecast warns: “The outlook for August is for normal to below normal levels,
  with notably to exceptionally low levels for the southern chalk and
  carboniferous limestones in central southern England, south Wales and the
  South Downs. Over August-October, normal to below normal levels are the most
  likely outcome.” The National Drought Group – which includes the Met Office,
  the government, regulators, water companies, the National Farmers’ Union, the
  Canal &amp; River Trust, anglers, and conservation experts – used the meeting
  to highlight the water-saving measures each sector is taking. Dr Will Lang,
  chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “This week is starting off warmer
  than of late across England and Wales, with temperatures getting towards the
  mid-30s celsius for some in the south. “As we move into the second half of
  August there are indications of high pressure building and therefore largely
  settled conditions overall. Although dry weather is more likely, rain, showers
  or thunderstorms cannot be ruled out.” The Environment Agency’s director of
  water and the National Drought Group chair, Helen Wakeham, said: “The current
  situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play
  their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment. “Water
  companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water.
  “We know the challenges farmers are facing and will continue to work with
  them, other land users and businesses to ensure everyone acts sustainably.”
