  Simon Jenkins’ article (He may talk rubbish but Trump has an eye for beauty,
  and that is a breath of fresh air, 1 August) was for the most part milquetoast
  Trump apologia, studded with the usual non-criticisms to give an impression of
  impartiality (yes, Trump does sometimes “talk rubbish”) and lauding one
  particular droplet in his firehose stream of insanity as some sort of
  visionary pronouncement (I would argue one of his more significant early
  actions was to economically attack my country, deride its sovereignty and muse
  on annexing us, but yes, restoring federal buildings is nice, too.) Where the
  article veered into insulting territory, however, was in comparing Trump to
  Teddy Roosevelt, claiming that both men “seemed to care about America’s
  natural environment, its forests and deserts, and a role for Washington in
  their custodianship”. To call this comparison absurd would be an
  understatement. Teddy Roosevelt was a committed conservationist who created
  the United States Forest Service; Trump called climate change a Chinese hoax.
  Roosevelt greatly expanded the national parks system; Trump opened up national
  parks in Alaska for oil drilling. Roosevelt created 51 wild bird reserves;
  Trump neutered the Migratory Bird Treaty Act at the behest of the fossil fuel
  industry. Roosevelt used executive orders to protect 600,000sq km of forest
  from logging and other exploitation; Trump used executive orders to try to
  bring back coal. Should I go on? Justin Joschko Ottawa, Ontario, Canada •
  Imposing classical revival styles in federal architecture is the tool of
  dictators. To insinuate that Trump has any taste at all fails. His own
  ostentatious display of wealth by dipping everything that he surrounds himself
  with in cheesy gold paint is proof. The American Institute of Architects is on
  record against this mandate as being retrograde, and calls out this failure to
  promote forward-reaching design and creative excellence. Joe Simmons Santa Fe,
  New Mexico, US • Beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder. As I have driven
  across Kansas, Oklahoma and crossing into California from Arizona on
  Interstate 10, I smile when I see those turbines turning and think, ah, green
  energy, less pollution and saving the planet. They, to me, are beautiful, much
  better than coal belching pollutants into the atmosphere. Kathryn Ackers
  Leawood, Kansas, US • How disingenuous to suggest that President Trump has any
  care for the aesthetic beauty of our environment, without noting his zeal for
  plundering the earth’s resources to their limit for personal and private
  profit. Don’t we all remember “Drill, baby, drill”? His antipathy to wind
  turbines, regardless of where they are sited, owes more to his loathing for
  renewable energy solutions than it does to his concerns about aesthetic
  beauty. Jane Hutcheson Castle Carrock, Cumbria • If Donald Trump has an eye
  for beauty, why did he destroy the sand dunes near Aberdeen in order to
  install his golf course? Cliff Saxton Lauzun, France
