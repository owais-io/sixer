  A group of nine human rights and freedom of expression organisations have
  called on the culture secretary to halt RedBird Capital’s proposed £500m
  takeover of the Telegraph and investigate the US private equity company’s ties
  to China. The international non-governmental organisations, which include
  Index on Censorship, Reporters Without Borders and Article 19, have written to
  Lisa Nandy arguing that RedBird Capital’s links with China “threaten media
  pluralism, transparency and information integrity in the UK”. A consortium led
  by RedBird Capital agreed a deal in May to buy the Daily Telegraph and Sunday
  Telegraph, ending two years of uncertainty over the future of the titles. The
  organisations said that RedBird Capital’s chair, John Thornton, sits on the
  advisory council of the China Investment Corporation, the country’s largest
  sovereign wealth fund. Thornton, a former chair of Goldman Sachs Asia, has
  also previously chaired the Silk Road Finance Corporation. “Both [are]
  vehicles through which China has pursued financial influence,” the letter
  said. The signatories, who also include Hong Kong Watch, Human Rights in China
  and the Hong Kong Democracy Council, said Nandy should follow her predecessor,
  Lucy Frazer, who issued a public interest intervention notice (PIIN) in
  January last year. RedBird Capital, which contributed 25% of the funding to
  the RedBird IMI joint venture that controls the Telegraph, is in the process
  of buying out its partner, IMI. IMI, which may retain a stake of up to 15% in
  the Telegraph under RedBird Capital’s plan, is controlled by Sheikh Mansour
  bin Zayed Al Nahyan, vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. The letter to
  Nandy states: “We believe that there is reasonable grounds to suspect the
  Telegraph acquisition by RedBird Capital raises both public interest and
  potential foreign media influence concerns. We call on you to issue relevant
  notices to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and Ofcom.” The
  signatories also said the culture department should ensure that the
  investigations carried out by the CMA and Ofcom, the communications regulator,
  involve independent consultation with “experts in Chinese foreign information
  manipulation and influence operations, as well as experts in media pluralism,
  transparency, and freedom of expression”. Separately, the former Conservative
  leader Iain Duncan Smith and the independent peer David Alton have written to
  Nandy asking her to investigate reports of a £5.3m editorial budget cut. The
  politicians claim that the cuts, revealed by the former Telegraph journalist
  Fraser Nelson, represent a change to the paper’s structure that is not allowed
  during a takeover process. They argued that the government’s 2024 public
  interest merger reference pending approval of a takeover prohibits changes to
  the editorial structure and staff of the Telegraph. A spokesperson for the
  newspaper group, said: “Ongoing management and oversight of Telegraph Media
  Group and its operations require the board and chief executive to liaise with
  all relevant stakeholders, including RedBird Capital, in line with agreed
  governance protocols. “The board and chief executive will continue to fulfil
  their fiduciary duties and facilitate an anticipated transaction, consistent
  with the requirements of relevant government legislation.” In June, a
  cross-party group of MPs and peers, including Duncan Smith and Lord Alton,
  called on ministers to investigate how RedBird Capital is funding its £500m
  takeover. A spokesperson for RedBird said: “There is no Chinese involvement or
  influence in RedBird Capital’s proposed acquisition of the Telegraph.” They
  added that the company had “been clear on its position regarding press
  independence, which is a fundamental tenet of its investment thesis in owning
  and growing news businesses – whether it’s CBS News in the US or the Telegraph
  in the UK”. The spokesperson said that, after more than two years in
  “regulatory limbo”, it was now time for the takeover to be completed and to
  “finally position the Telegraph for growth”. “The partnership with RedBird
  will enable the Telegraph’s world-class group of editors and reporters to
  thrive in this transformative moment for news organisations globally.” Last
  month, the sale of the Telegraph came a step closer after government
  legislation to allow foreign states to own up to 15% in British newspapers
  survived a potentially fatal vote in the House of Lords. RedBird Capital –
  which is also potentially aiming to bring in investors including the parent
  company of the Daily Mail and Len Blavatnik, the owner of Warner Music – has
  also said it can fully fund a deal in its own right. The government declined
  to comment.
