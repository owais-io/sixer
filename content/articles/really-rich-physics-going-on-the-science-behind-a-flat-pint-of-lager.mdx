  A flat pint of beer with no head is a common gripe among pub-goers. And while
  the bar staff’s pint-pulling technique is often assumed to be the cause,
  scientists have discovered that the stability of beer foam is also highly
  dependent on the chemical makeup of the brew. Triple fermented beers have the
  most stable foams, the study found, while the froth created by single
  fermentation beers, including lagers, are inherently more likely to collapse
  before you have time to take the first sip. “We now know the mechanism exactly
  and are able to help the brewery improve the foam of their beers,” said Prof
  Jan Vermant, a chemical engineer at ETH Zurich, who led the study. The
  research began as a “typical Friday afternoon project”, Vermant said. “We
  decided to study beer and found this really rich physics going on.” Like any
  other foam, beer foam is made of many small bubbles of air, separated from
  each other by thin films of liquid. Under the pull of gravity and the pressure
  exerted by surrounding bubbles, the films of liquid slowly thin out, the
  bubbles pop and the foam collapses. But the rate at which this process occurs
  was found to vary depending on the form of a barley-derived protein, called
  Liquid Transfer Protein 1 (LTP1). “The idea was to directly study what happens
  in the thin film that separates two neighbouring bubbles,” said Dr Emmanouil
  Chatzigiannakis, an assistant professor at Eindhoven University of Technology
  and first author of the study. Turning to a collection of scientific imaging
  techniques, the team was able to determine how these thin films could hold
  together to make a stable foam. “We can directly visualise what’s happening
  when two bubbles come into close proximity,” Chatzigiannakis said. “We can
  directly see the bubble’s protein aggregates, their interface and their
  structure.” In single fermentation beers, the LPT1 proteins have a globular
  form and arrange themselves densely as small, spherical particles on the
  surface of the bubbles. “It’s not a very stable foam,” Vermant said. During
  the second fermentation, the proteins become slightly unravelled and form a
  net-like structure that acts as a stretchy elastic skin on the surface of
  bubbles. This makes the liquid more viscous and the bubbles more stable.
  During the third fermentation, the LPT1 proteins become broken down into
  fragments that have a water-repellent (hydrophobic) end and a “water-loving”
  (hydrophilic) end. In these beers, a phenomenon called the Marangoni effect
  comes into play, which drives liquid flow from protein-rich (thicker) areas of
  the bubble to protein-depleted (thinner) areas, delaying the bursting of
  bubbles. A similar effect is seen with soap bubbles, where swirling can often
  be seen on the surface for the same reason. “These protein fragments function
  like surfactants, which stabilise foams in many everyday applications such as
  detergents,” Vermant said. Some of the triple fermented beers had foams that
  were stable for 15 minutes. Vermant, who is Belgian, said the findings could
  help brewers increase or decrease the amount of foam as desired. There may be
  differing views, though, on whether a foamy pint is desirable or represents
  poor value for money. “Foam isn’t that important everywhere beer is served –
  it’s basically a cultural thing,” he said. The findings are published in the
  journal Physics of Fluids.
