  If the voting age drops to 16, how will you encourage young people to take
  part? Danny Braverman, 63, Suffolk Ellie Chowns and Adrian Ramsay: Young
  people face intergenerational injustice in many areas, from housing to
  education, and need to see they can make a difference through politics. Not
  least to the climate and nature crises that threaten to destroy their future –
  which is one reason we need to keep this primary focus. Adrian joined the
  Green party at 16, co-founded the Young Greens and has consistently championed
  youth representation. Ellie – as councillor, MEP and MP – has encouraged young
  people’s involvement, pushing for youth inclusion on local boards, taking
  groups to the EU and Westminster parliaments, and setting up the West Midlands
  Youth Climate Assembly. Zack Polanski: Inspire them. Listen to them. Involve
  them. Young people face stagnant wages, high costs and the climate crisis. Why
  would they engage unless they can feel it makes a real difference? We need
  every young person to experience their power early on – through local
  campaigns, climate action or activism. As deputy leader, I’ve consistently
  amplified youth voices. As leader, I’ll turn the volume up. Danny Braverman:
  I’m disappointed with both responses. Representative democracy will not
  motivate the very many disengaged young people. Radicalism lies in
  participatory democracy, such as regional youth citizens assemblies. I’d like
  to see Zach as the new leader. He’s the nearest to my own politics. I’d
  describe myself as a watermelon: green on the outside, red on the inside, with
  some black anarchist pips for good measure. What role does class have in your
  understanding of the world? Simon Legg, 71, Felixstowe EC &amp; AR: The
  widening inequality and deepening poverty that blight so many lives are so
  clearly linked to the concentration of more and more wealth into fewer and
  fewer hands. Those with the least are the first to be hit hard by climate
  breakdown, and a just transition to a zero-carbon world can’t happen without
  much greater redistribution of wealth. At the heart of Green politics – and
  our personal values – is a commitment to the fundamental equality of all
  people, to breaking down barriers and sharing resources fairly. Politics is
  how we can reverse the market’s tendency to concentrate wealth and power. ZP:
  Class is central. Without fair wages, resources and skills, other inequalities
  persist. We must be rooted in working-class communities. People know that the
  super rich and corporations are destroying our environment, communities and
  democracies. This isn’t “us v them” – it’s all of us, building change from the
  grassroots up. Simon Legg: These are decent answers to a question that could
  legitimately be answered in innumerable ways. If the Greens were in a position
  to join a coalition government, what policies would you insist were adopted?
  Hana Prosser, 56, Oxford EC &amp; AR: With the political landscape shifting at
  incredible speed, we see this as an entirely possible scenario. We’d focus on
  three things: electoral reform, fair taxation of extreme wealth to invest in
  public services, and strong climate and nature action. The introduction of a
  proportional voting system would be a complete game changer, and we’d want
  this to be a red line in negotiations. First past the post leaves millions of
  people feeling unrepresented, driving cynicism and disillusionment with
  politics – which are deeply corrosive to democracy. It also raises the risk of
  an extremist government elected on a minority of votes. ZP: A wealth tax to
  tackle inequality. Proportional representation (PR) so every vote counts.
  Serious climate action, starting with a nationwide home-insulation rollout.
  These are red lines about fairness, democracy and a liveable planet. Hana
  Prosser: 10/10 for ambition! I appreciate Zack identifying specific policy
  actions. But are three red lines realistic? I fear the Greens either
  presenting an indigestible package deal to coalition partners or, once in
  government, becoming Lib Dem-style hostages to fortune. Ellie and Adrian’s
  single red line – PR – seems more credible. Polls suggest the new party being
  formed by Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana could secure 10% of the vote. Should
  the Greens explore a pact with it? David Lowry, 68, Ewell EC &amp; AR: We’re
  always ready to work constructively with other parties where we agree, and
  often do so in parliament – including with Jeremy and Zarah. We’re open in
  principle to electoral alliances to stop Reform UK, but this would need to be
  a wider collaboration to be effective. And unless there are clear commitments
  to a fair voting system, and to tackling the climate and nature crises, there
  will be major differences between us. It’s crucial for the Green party to keep
  its distinctive identity, offering a genuinely fresh vision of a fairer,
  greener country with much broader appeal than an old left party. ZP: I have
  huge respect for both Zarah and Jeremy and have shared many platforms with
  them for a whole variety of campaigns – most recently against the genocide in
  Gaza. But the party doesn’t exist yet, so it’s far too soon for electoral
  pacts. Right now we need coalitions of ideas, working with anyone who shares
  our values of environmental, social, racial and economic justice. I do already
  consider them allies – the actual fight must be against Reform UK and this
  failing Labour government. David Lowry: I think the concerns of Ellie and
  Adrian that the new progressive party might not support a fair voting system
  are misplaced. It is in their own electoral interest to do so. Climate change
  and biodiversity loss are likely to result in medical crises against which the
  UK has little defence. How do you plan to mitigate them? Rajarshi
  Raychaudhuri, 58, Dudley EC &amp; AR: We need to treat the climate and nature
  emergencies as the public health threats they are – and that means action
  across all areas of society and the economy. We’re already pressing hard for
  these: affordable, warm, net-zero housing for all, resilient to overheating
  and to flooding; good public transport, and safe walking and cycling;
  sustainable, healthy food systems. Tackling the climate crisis means fixing
  our food, housing and transport systems and more – doing this will hugely
  increase our resilience and health, as well as directly reducing emissions.
  Building resilience to climate impacts is vital to our national security. ZP:
  I’ve chaired the environment committee in the London Assembly for the past few
  years and produced a report with University College London which includes
  recommendations for mitigation of emissions and climate adaptation. We need to
  make sure active travel and public transport are properly resourced, the
  cheapest option and accessible to all. We need to make sure that we’re also
  building the infrastructure we need to tackle climate disasters such as
  wildfires and floods, including nature-friendly solutions. And we need to
  co-design (including using citizens assemblies) so people are involved with
  the decision-making process rather than have things done to them. Rajarshi
  Raychaudhuri: My question dealt specifically with climate change, biodiversity
  loss and a medical catastrophe, like the Covid-19 pandemic, which was more
  likely a result of biodiversity loss than US scaremongering. I note that the
  answer, while apparently audacious and impressive, does not deal with the
  question. However, having been an enthusiastic environmental activist in my
  youth, I continue to hope. I shall certainly follow the progress of the
  candidates with great interest. If 50% of the electorate believes a vote for
  the Greens is a wasted vote, how would you convince people that a vote for
  Green wouldn’t be a vote for Reform UK? Adam Butlin, 26, London EC &amp; AR:
  Such arguments have been used to prop up the failed two-party system for
  decades. Now it’s blown wide open, and there are huge opportunities for the
  Greens. Under Carla Denyer and Adrian’s leadership, we’ve shown we can win
  parliamentary seats everywhere, from big cities to rural constituencies. In
  local elections we’ve gained every year for the past eight years, and Green
  councillors have earned strong trust. Voters can now see clearly that if you
  vote Green, we can win Green. That appeals not just to those disillusioned
  with the old politics but to all those hopeful for a greener, fairer future.
  ZP: We now have four MPs, three London Assembly members and more than 800
  councillors. We got nearly 2 million votes and 39 second-place finishes –
  we’re planning to turn them into MPs at the next general election. My central
  mission is to make Keir Starmer more worried about losing votes and ultimately
  losing more seats to the Green party than to Reform UK. Until he feels that
  electoral pressure from his left, this country will continue to veer to the
  right. It seems that no marginalised group is off the table for cruelty. We
  stop that happening right now by growing the Green party. Adam Butlin: I
  personally preferred Zack’s response, but all the candidates have clearly
  addressed the central point of my question, emphasising both recent electoral
  successes and the potential for political leverage over the mainstream
  parties. I can only hope that voters also see the strategic impact of voting
  Green. Should the UK have a fairer immigration system? Under present rules I
  would not have been able to come with my husband because then he did not earn
  £38,000 Patricia Jephson, 41, Worcester EC &amp; AR: Generations of immigrants
  have made a huge contribution – culturally and economically – to our national
  life. We’re proud to celebrate this and condemn the demonisation of migrants
  by the media and politicians, which is driving racist hate. We want to see a
  humane system of managed immigration and are opposed to rules that
  discriminate on the grounds of income or impose unreasonable costs on people
  who move here. This is not only unfair but it also ignores the fact that many
  currently low-paid jobs – in social care, for instance – are actually far more
  socially valuable than many higher-paid jobs – say in banking. ZP: We need to
  tell the truth. With an ageing population, we badly need migration. Of course
  we should also train up British workers, but it doesn’t have to be an
  either/or. If you use the NHS, the person who cares for you is more likely to
  be a migrant than anyone in front of you in the queue. And the unfair rules
  around visas just cause unnecessary stress on families kept apart for
  absolutely no reason but to appease the right. The real problem in our country
  is not migrants but years of austerity under both Conservative and Labour
  governments. Patricia Jephson: I have heard no end of nonsense from the
  Conservative and now Labour representatives in my area regarding immigration,
  which is one of the reasons why I joined the Green party. I am glad that
  Ellie, Adrian and Zack all value immigrants and our contributions to our
  adopted home, the UK. Should the UK rejoin the European single market and
  customs union? Richard Norton, 55, Rochester EC &amp; AR: Rejoining the
  customs union is one of many win-win steps we should be taking immediately
  towards undoing the economic damage done by Brexit and rebuilding our
  relationship with our nearest neighbours. The single market is trickier –
  there would clearly be major economic benefits, but as non-EU members we
  wouldn’t have a say in making its rules. In the long term, we believe
  Britain’s best future is in the EU family of sovereign nations, and Brexit is
  now seen as a bad mistake by most people in the UK. It’s not a mistake that’s
  irreversible when political conditions are right. ZP: There’s no area of our
  life that Brexit has improved – it’s been an absolute disaster. We also know
  that, in poll after poll, even people who voted for Brexit now regret it. I
  don’t think Europe is perfect, and there are huge changes I want to see, but
  ultimately I think we’d be a lot better in rather than out. And a natural
  first step to that is to rejoin the customs union. The single market would
  only make sense if we were re-entering anyway. Richard Norton: I’d like the
  candidates’ positions to feel more proactive – to shape politics, not wait for
  “conditions”. Our economy, society, young people and environment deserve a
  future without the contamination of Brexit.
