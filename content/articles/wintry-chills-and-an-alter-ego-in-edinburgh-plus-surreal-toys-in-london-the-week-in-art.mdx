  Exhibition of the week Victoria Crowe: Shifting Surfaces To mark the 80th
  birthday of this Scottish artist, this evocative survey brings together some
  of her rural portraits and wintry landscapes. • Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh,
  until 11 October Also showing Paule Vézelay: Living Lines Survey of this
  British abstract painter who was strongly influenced by French modernism and
  changed her name accordingly (she was born Marjorie Watson-Williams in 1892).
  • Towner, Eastbourne, until 31 August Nkem Okwechime: Okolo An installation
  exploring the artist’s alter ego, including artist-made wallpaper and tiles,
  created with community groups. • National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, until
  22 August Dr Esther Mahlangu: Umuntu Ngumuntu Ngabantu A bold open-air mural
  paying homage to Ndebele cultural traditions by this South African artist. •
  Serpentine Gallery North Garden, London, until 28 September Permindar Kaur:
  Mirror, Mirror Ordinary domestic objects including toys become surreal
  artworks, set against Sir John Soane’s Romantic architecture. • Pizthanger
  Abbey, London until 21 Setptember Image of the week LensCulture’s Critics’
  Choice awards featured striking photographs, from hazardous trips through the
  Kurdish mountains to a queer journey into the heart of Americana. Pictured
  above is Florida Boys by Josh Aronson. You can see more images and read all
  about them here. What we learned A huge ‘protest artwork by Anish Kapoor was
  installed on North Sea gas rig by Greenpeace The Trump administration is to
  ensure exhibits are ‘patriotic’ at 19 museums A Chris Ofili painting featuring
  elephant dung could be sold for £1.5m at auction A Sudanese exile turned to
  photography as an outlet for trauma In Ghana, coffins can be very stylish A
  London sewer project has generated dramatic new public spaces with giant
  artworks Early Beatles photos by Paul McCartney are to go on show in London
  Sensuous art nouveau is “ripe for revival” in the age of AI The exhibition
  Saved Treasures of Gaza is a hit in Paris Masterpiece of the week Pan Pursuing
  Syrinx by Hendrick van Balen the Elder and a follower of Jan Brueghel the
  Elder, possibly after 1615 The book that has had the biggest influence on
  European and American art, from Botticelli to Rauschenberg, is not an artistic
  manual or work of theory, but the Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses. This Latin
  epic poem tells the Greco-Roman myths around the theme of transformation or
  metamorphosis: love and desire, fury and grief can all change your very
  nature. In this painting, just one minor example of the many inspired by
  Ovid’s tales, Syrinx is about to be turned into reeds, to rescue her from the
  aggressive lust of Pan. It’s a collaboration between a figure painter and
  nature specialist: Jan Brueghel the Elder painted flowers and landscapes and
  his follower gives this scene finely observed natural details including a
  dragonfly and frogs. • National Gallery, London Sign up to the Art Weekly
