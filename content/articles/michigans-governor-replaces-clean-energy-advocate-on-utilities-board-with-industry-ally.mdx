  ‘industry ally’

  Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has effectively ousted a clean energy
  advocate from serving on a board that regulates the state’s energy utilities
  monopoly, and replaced her with someone who environmental groups charge is an
  “industry ally”, campaigners say. The groups allege the move was made at
  utility giant DTE Energy’s behest because it was unhappy with Michigan public
  services commission (MPSC) board member Alessandra Carreon’s position on clean
  energy and opposition to rate increases, among other issues. Each MPSC board
  vote is important because the commission is made up of three gubernatorial
  appointees, and Whitmer’s decision amid a debate over rate increases could
  slow the state’s ambitious clean energy transition and lead to higher energy
  bills, opponents warn. The decision marks the latest in a series of
  environmental controversies for Whitmer, a Democrat whose name has been
  discussed as a potential leading candidate for the party’s nominee for
  president in 2028, but now faces increasing scrutiny over her record.
  Appointing someone with industry ties to a board that is supposed to protect
  the public from utility wrongdoing “reflects incredibly poorly on Governor
  Whitmer”, said Chris Gilmer-Hill, a policy associate with the Michigan
  Environmental Justice Coalition non-profit. “This is part of this pattern of
  this administration being very quick to give utilities what they want and not
  giving Michiganders what they need,” Gilmer-Hill added. Whitmer appointed
  Carreon to the MPSC board in July 2023 to fill a partial term. Among other
  causes, Carreon was an advocate for greater public involvement in and
  transparency around the arcane regulatory process for utilities at a time when
  public frustration over DTE’s poor service and high rates has steadily
  mounted. In a highly unusual move, the governor announced in June that she
  would not renew Carreon’s appointment. Environmental groups in June lambasted
  the decision, which they alleged came amid pressure from DTE and Consumers
  Energy, Michigan’s second largest utility monopoly. “My understanding is that
  DTE and Consumers were very unhappy with recent decisions the commission has
  made around the utilities’ profit margin,” Charlotte Jameson, the chief policy
  officer of the Michigan Environmental Council, told the Detroit News at the
  time. Many of the state’s top environmental groups signed an 18 June letter to
  Whitmer that stated they were “deeply concerned” with the decision not to
  renew Carreon’s appointment and potentially replace her with someone who has
  “clear conflicts of interest or strong industry allegiances”. They urged the
  governor to reconsider. Whitmer did not. In mid-July, she appointed Shaquila
  Myers, who, during the 2023-2024 legislative session, was chief of staff for
  former Michigan House speaker Joe Tate, a pro-business Democrat. He faced a
  stunning revolt from his own party in December because he generally refused to
  allow votes on legislation opposed by big business, and was seen by many as
  hostile towards environmental causes. Despite a chorus of calls for change,
  Tate did not allow multiple utility reform bills to move through the
  legislature. “There was a quiet, steady refusal to do anything but ignore
  [utility] bills,” said Rachel Hood, a former Democratic state representative
  who served with Tate last session, and has worked on energy policy in Michigan
  for nearly 20 years. Hood characterized Myers as “not just an industry ally”,
  but also “deeply enmeshed in the governor’s policy agenda”. “And it’s clear
  that the governor is pushing DTE’s agenda to the best of her ability,” Hood
  said. DTE and Consumers are among the state’s powerful political forces. The
  former, either via the company, its employees or its affiliated dark money
  non-profit, has given millions of dollars in campaign donations to Whitmer or
  the state Democratic party over her two terms. Meanwhile, a 2022 analysis
  found DTE had donated to all but 10 of 148 state legislators the previous
  session. Amid furor over prolonged power outages that left hundreds of
  thousands of people in Michigan without power for days in late 2023, DTE’s
  affiliated dark money non-profit gave Tate $100,000. Tate would not let a 2023
  reform bill aimed at improving accountability and affordability be introduced
  in committee. “This is Michigan’s powerful political entities acting to
  maintain their way of life and their balance sheets,” said Hood. Meanwhile,
  Tate and Whitmer ushered through a datacenter bill that may derail Michigan’s
  climate goals. Whitmer’s office did not comment, but a Whitmer spokesperson
  sent statements on behalf of DTE and Consumers. The utilities separately sent
  their own statements in which they both denied involvement in the process. In
  its statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “Our team at DTE works collaboratively
  with the MPSC commissioners and staff to ensure we’re providing safe,
  reliable, cleaner and affordable energy to our customers and the state of
  Michigan.” The move comes at a particularly critical juncture. The MPSC is
  weighing over $1bn in proposed rate increases between the two companies, and
  each are slated to deliver to the MPSC formal long-term plans for delivering
  power. Commissioners have the power to shape those proposals with decisions
  about billions of dollars in infrastructure. The MPSC has not allowed a DTE
  proposal to build a methane plant, and advocates fear that decision could be
  reversed with Myers on the board, Gilmer-Hill said. Meanwhile, the utilities
  are negotiating datacenter deals that could result in dramatic cost increases
  to customers and take a toll on the environment if they are not checked by the
  MPSC, Gilmer-Hill added. “We need an MPSC that’s willing to say no to the
  utilities, otherwise we mess things up for decades,” Gilmer-Hill said.
