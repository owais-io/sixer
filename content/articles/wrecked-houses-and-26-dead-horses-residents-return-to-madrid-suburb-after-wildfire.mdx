  Adolfo López plunged his head and hands into his parents’ swimming pool early
  on Tuesday afternoon, keen to wash off the soot and dirt he had acquired from
  the gutted house his mother and father had called home for the past 25 years.
  The wildfire that would devour 1,000 hectares of land, consume their house,
  destroy some neighbouring properties and kill a man trying to rescue horses
  from a local stables was just a column of smoke when López saw it approaching
  Soto de Viñuelas at 7.45pm on Monday. Then the smoke gave way to fire and the
  curiosity turned to panic. The pharmaceutical researcher, who lives in France
  and had brought his family to visit his parents half an hour north of Madrid,
  scooped everyone up and headed to a local hotel. While they were away, the
  blaze – the apparent fruit of the current heatwave, Soto’s tinder-dry
  vegetation and winds of more than 70km/h (45mph) – tore through the area and
  through the nearby suburbs of Tres Cantos, leading authorities to order the
  evacuation of 180 people. When they came back to their homes the following
  day, some residents found burnt-out wrecks. “At least it’s just the house,”
  said López. “We’ll just see what happens now but at least everyone is safe and
  my parents are OK. You can rebuild a house …” One of his parents’ neighbours
  had been luckier. The flames had stopped at the perimeter of his house,
  cremating shrubs and blackening the wire fence but leaving his home remarkably
  intact. As the owner went around dousing the still-hot earth with a hose, his
  father explained what had happened. “My son just grabbed his dog when it
  happened and put it in the car and then went to pick up the neighbours and get
  out,” he said. “I thought the whole house would have burned but it’s just the
  perimeter.” The big worry now, he added, was making sure there was enough
  water: “They say it’s going to be hot and windy this afternoon and the wind
  could relight the embers under the ash and start the fire again.” As planes
  flew through the grey skies high above a nearby British private school that
  had had a similarly miraculous escape, a local couple paid tribute to the
  55-year-old Romanian man who had died when the fire reached the stables. “He
  died trying to save horses in the stables, where 26 horses burned to death,”
  said José Luis Ramírez, a telecoms engineer who lives up the road. “He was
  really great and he worked so hard,” said Ramírez’s wife, Brenda. The dead
  man, who has yet to be named, suffered burns to 98% of his body and died after
  being flown to hospital by helicopter. By 1pm, the residents of Soto and Tres
  Cantos who had spent the night on mattresses in a local leisure centre had
  packed up and headed home to inspect the aftermath of the blaze. Jesús Moreno
  García, the mayor of Tres Cantos, said firefighters had told him they had
  never seen a blaze like it. “It spread so quickly because of the strong
  winds,” he told local TV. “We’ve been through something really shocking.” The
  air of unreality and the stink of smoke were compounded by the lingering
  presence of the many fire engines and vehicles from the military emergencies
  unit that had helped save the well-heeled neighbourhoods. “It was all just
  like a dream and today we’re just checking on the damage,” said Ramírez as he
  and his wife walked down the road between blackened hills. Some houses in Soto
  were evidently beyond saving. The roof of one had collapsed to reveal the
  still-smoking floor plan beneath. The garden had fared better: despite the
  ash-grey pool, the skeleton of a trampoline and the piles of soot and twisted,
  dead shrubs, a hammock still hung between two untouched pine trees. Around the
  corner, Adolfo López’s mother came out of her ruined house, said good
  afternoon and shook her head. “Esto es lo que hay,” she said. This is how
  things are.
