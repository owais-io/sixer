  Marjorie Taylor Greene, historically one of the most prominent voices in
  Donald Trump’s Maga movement, has declared in an interview that she feels that
  the Republican party has lost touch with its base, but she said she has no
  plans to leave the party. After telling the Daily Mail this week she was
  questioning whether she still belongs in the Republican fold, the Georgia
  congresswoman told the Guardian she would not become independent or seek a
  third party option. “No – I’m urging my own party to support ‘America first’,”
  Greene said. Still, she made clear resounding frustration with GOP leadership
  and her place within the party’s planning. “I don’t know if the Republican
  party is leaving me, or if I’m kind of not relating to Republican party as
  much any more,” Greene said in the Daily Mail interview. “I don’t know which
  one it is.” Greene, who boasts 7.5 million followers on X and commands one of
  the largest social media audiences of any Republican woman, accused party
  leaders of betraying core conservative principles. She did not criticize Trump
  himself, instead preferring to express her ire for what she attempted to paint
  as political elites. “I think the Republican party has turned its back on
  ‘America first’ and the workers and just regular Americans,” she said, warning
  that GOP leadership was reverting to its “neocon” past under the influence of
  what she termed the “good ole boys” network. The 51-year-old lawmaker, in the
  roughly six-month mark following Trump’s return to the White House, said she
  was particularly frustrated with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, saying: “I’m
  not afraid of Mike Johnson at all.” Her remarks reflect a broader pattern of
  voter dissatisfaction with traditional party structures. Americans appear to
  also be holding deeply unfavorable views of both major parties: a July Wall
  Street Journal poll found 63% view the Democratic party unfavorably, its worst
  rating in 35 years, while Republicans fare only marginally better in most
  surveys. Independent or independent-leaning Americans now account for nearly
  half the electorate, according to July Gallup polling, and public support has
  increasingly shifted toward Democrats through those leaners in recent months.
  On Monday, Greene used social media to criticize the lack of accountability
  over what she deems key issues to the base, sharing a table showing no arrests
  for the “Russian Collusion Hoax”, “Jan 6th”, and “2020 Election”. “Like what
  happened all those issues? You know that I don’t know what the hell happened
  with the Republican Party. I really don’t,” she said in the interview. “But
  I’ll tell you one thing, the course that it’s on, I don’t want to have
  anything to do with it, and I just don’t care any more.” Her recent bills have
  targeted unconventional Republican territory: preventing cloud-seeding, making
  English the official US language, and cutting capital gains taxes on homes.
  She is also the first Republican in Congress to label the crisis in Gaza a
  genocide, and has called for ending foreign aid and using the so-called
  “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to cut down fraud and waste in
  the government. Greene acknowledged her isolation within the party, saying:
  “I’m going alone right now on the issues that I’m speaking about.”
