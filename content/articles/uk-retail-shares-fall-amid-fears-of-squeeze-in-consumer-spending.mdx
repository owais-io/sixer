  Fears that UK consumers will rein in spending in the second half of this year
  has knocked the values of some of Britain’s biggest retailers including the
  parent groups of Primark and B&amp;Q, and DIY chain Wickes. The retailers’
  share prices dropped on Tuesday morning after analysts at Deutsche Bank warned
  that retail spending could be hit by the cooling UK jobs market and easing
  growth in household income. “Fear of unemployment may constrain household
  spending amid concerns over inflation,” the analysts wrote in a note that
  flagged particular concerns about Next, Wickes and Kingfisher, which owns
  B&amp;Q and Screwfix, as well as Associated British Foods, which owns Primark.
  It said that essential costs for households were likely to increase, putting
  “a squeeze” on discretionary spending such as clothing and DIY. In contrast,
  food retailers, such as Tesco and M&amp;S, and the cut-price operator B&amp;M
  are expected to benefit as the cost of groceries continues to rise.
  Predictions that Rachel Reeves will raise taxes in her budget later this year
  could also hurt consumer confidence. “There is a fear that the concerns
  created by the tax-raising measures seen in the 2024 November budget will
  repeat in the 2025 budget which will have a negative impact on spending,”
  Deutsche Bank added. Its analysts warned that “cracks are emerging in the UK
  labour market”, citing the recent rise in the unemployment rate and a fall in
  the number of people on company payrolls. Shares in Kingfisher fell by 3.4%,
  making it the top faller on the FTSE 100 share index, followed by Associated
  British Foods, which lost 2.8%. Wickes tumbled 8.6% on the smaller FTSE 250
  share index. While poorer households have been under pressure for some time,
  high income groups are now showing signs of concern about the future,
  according to Deutsche’s “fear index”, which incorporates six factors including
  current unemployment risk, likelihood to voluntarily change jobs, concerns
  around financial future and near-term cash concerns. The note was published as
  a separate study, Asda’s monthly income tracker revealed the first decline in
  disposable cash for middle-income families in two years. In July, those on
  gross annual earnings of about £41,000 experienced a 1.6% year-on-year decline
  in their income. Lower-income families were the hardest hit, as spending power
  slumped by 11%, resulting in a shortfall of £73 each week, according to the
  research carried out for the supermarket by the Centre for Economics and
  Business Research (Cebr). However, chunky increases in disposable income for
  the better-off meant that average disposable income rose by 2.4% in July
  compared with a year before to £255. Sam Miley, the head of forecasting and
  thought leadership at Cebr, said: “While wages are expected to rise over the
  remainder of the year, persistently high inflation will put continued pressure
  on purchasing power, weighing on further gains [in disposable income].”
  Deutsche Bank’s research suggests consumer fears have been on the rise since
  the end of the pandemic, and recent changes have been largely driven by
  consumers being increasingly unwilling to voluntarily change job. “This likely
  reflects risk-adverse behaviour due to fears around a cooling job market,” the
  analysts said. “Compared with the historical average since mid-2019, consumers
  feel more at risk of being made unemployed and are generally more pessimistic
  around their future job security, although these last two components have not
  seen a year-on-year deterioration,” Deutsche Bank said. Inflation is also
  likely to fade next year, when Deutsche Bank expects a “sequential
  improvement” but it said the leisure industry could benefit more from any rise
  in discretionary spending as in the past year spending on leisure pursuits
  such as holidays, music festivals and sport has outperformed retail spending
  by about six percentage points. Deutsche Bank downgraded its ratings on AB
  Foods and Wickes to sell, from hold, and cut Kingfisher to hold, having
  previously recommended buying its shares.
