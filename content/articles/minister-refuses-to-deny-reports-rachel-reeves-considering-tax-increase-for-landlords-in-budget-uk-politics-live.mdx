  The Home Office’s bid to challenge the decision to temporarily block the owner
  of the Bell hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers is to be heard at the
  court of appeal on Thursday. Last week, Mr Justice Eyre granted an interim
  injunction to Epping Forest district council, stopping the hotel’s owner,
  Somani Hotels, from using the Essex hotel to accommodate asylum seekers beyond
  12 September. The authority asked for an injunction to be granted after the
  hotel became the focal point of several protests and counter-protests in
  recent weeks. The Home Office and Somani Hotels will both seek to challenge
  the ruling at a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, with the
  department also in an attempt to appeal against Eyre’s decision not to let it
  intervene in the case. The hearing before Lord Justice Bean, Lady Justice
  Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb is due to start at 10am. Former prime
  minister Liz Truss has appeared on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to give her
  views on the current economic situation in the UK. Asked whether she would
  join Reform, she said she was “not really thinking about party politics at the
  moment because my whole experience of being in government was that the power
  was not in the hands of the politicians”. Truss added that a Farage government
  cannot work without an institutional shake up: Even if Nigel Farage gets
  elected in 2029, if the bureaucracy is not changed, if there is not
  fundamental change of how the UK is wrong, nothing will change. On the NHS,
  she said: The cult is wearing thin. There is, has, been a cult. People are
  recognising its failures. I don’t think the American system is anything to
  aspire to but if you look at countries like Germany, France [and] Japan, they
  manage to achieve better outcomes with similar levels of spending. I think
  everyone in Britain recognises that it’s not working as it is currently
  constituted. On the health system being free at the point of use, Truss added:
  It costs you in other ways. Keir Starmer has appointed the outspoken founder
  of Octopus Energy as an adviser, with a remit to challenge government
  thinking. Greg Jackson has joined the Cabinet Office board, an influential
  core of government advisers, as a non-executive member. The announcement comes
  weeks after ministers ruled out his plan to split the national energy market
  into regional zones, which would have meant users in different areas would pay
  different rates for their electricity. The tech entrepreneur, who has long had
  links to the Labour party, responded to that decision by saying he would
  “respectfully disagree”. Jackson failed to win over ministers after a long and
  controversial campaign, in part because zonal pricing would have meant higher
  energy prices in the south-east of England and lower prices in Scotland. He
  claimed that electricity prices that reflected local supply and demand
  dynamics would encourage heavy electricity users to relocate to areas that
  have more renewable energy generation such as Scotland and encourage
  renewables developers to base their projects closer to where their energy was
  needed. Jackson is now expected to play an influential role in shaping how
  future government policies are implemented. His non-executive role is one of a
  number that are understood to have been introduced to bring in expertise from
  outside government to help civil servants gain a strategic perspective on
  policy decisions. Jackson is expected to use his three-year term on the
  Cabinet Office board to push the government to modernise. The tech founder,
  who set up Octopus in 2015, has won respect in Westminster after building the
  energy supplier’s global reach to secure a valuation of £9bn for the company
  in less than a decade. Speculation that the chancellor could announce new
  property taxes in her autumn budget is likely to slow down an already
  price-sensitive housing market, estate agents have said. Rachel Reeves is
  reportedly considering a tax on the sale of homes over £500,000 and the
  removal of the capital gains tax exemption on primary residences above £1.5m
  as ways to boost income for the government. The property website Zoopla said
  changes to the taxation of homes over £500,000 “may make some buyers consider
  a wait-and-see strategy. This covers those who may possibly save money on
  purchases under £500,000 and concern those buying over this level as well”. It
  said a third of homes for sale were priced at more than £500,000, with London
  and the south-east of England in line to be most affected by a change. The
  website’s latest monthly snapshot of the property market showed the number of
  sales agreed was up by 5% year on year in July and that average prices had
  risen by 1.3%. One in 10 homes listed had been reduced in price, above the
  five-year average of 6% of homes. Homes that have been reduced are typically
  on the market for almost two and a half times longer than those that are
  priced well when they go on the market, Zoopla said. Richard Donnell, an
  executive director at Zoopla, said: Sellers need to understand local market
  conditions when considering how to market their home, setting the right price
  and how quickly they would like to sell. The risk of being too ambitious on
  price is your home taking more than twice as long to find a buyer, or not
  selling at all. Ed Davey said “no disrespect is meant to the king” in his
  decision to boycott Donald’s Trump’s state banquet next month in a protest
  against the US president’s position on Gaza (see 8.59am BST). The Liberal
  Democrat leader told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I think anyone who knows
  my approach to the monarchy, and to the king in particular, knows how much I
  respect him. I’ve written to him personally and the fact, as I say, that I’ve
  had to wrestle with it shows that no disrespect is meant to the king at all.
  Announcing the boycott, the politician said he and his wife, Emily, had
  “prayed about it”. He told the Today programme: I am a Christian. My wife and
  I go to our local church, St Andrew’s and St Mark’s, very regularly. My faith
  is very important to me and to my wife and although you’re right, other people
  say religion doesn’t impact your politics, it does impact mine. I don’t talk
  about it very much but in this moment I had to be very honest, I’ve thought
  and prayed about this, I really have. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey,
  will boycott King Charles’s state banquet held in honour of Donald Trump to
  protest against the US president’s failure to intervene decisively to end the
  war in Gaza. Davey, who is invited to the dinner for Trump’s state visit to
  the UK, said to turn down an invitation from the king went against all his
  instincts and that it was a deeply serious move to refuse to attend. But he
  said he feared unless he took a stand over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and
  the lack of pressure on Israel from the US government, no one would raise the
  issue during the president’s visit in late September. Davey said: Boycotting
  the state banquet is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is
  the only way I can send a message to both Donald Trump and Keir Starmer that
  they cannot close their eyes and wish this away. Trump’s state visit is an
  honour that has never previously been extended for a second time to a US
  president. Davey said he believed Keir Starmer was right to engage with Trump,
  but said it was vital that someone raised the issue of Gaza in a way that
  could not be ignored. In a Guardian piece explaining his decision, Davey
  wrote: The humanitarian crisis in Gaza must stop. The famine must end. The
  hostages must be returned home. There is one man, more than anyone else, who
  has the power to make it happen. Donald Trump could do those things today if
  he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire
  and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace, with a two-state
  solution. But so far, he’s decided not to. Instead, he’s given Netanyahu his
  full support. A Government minister refused to be drawn on reports the
  Treasury is considering a tax increase on landlords for Rachel Reeves’s autumn
  budget. Stephen Morgan, education minister, told Times Radio and Sky News he
  was unable to comment on speculation which was reported in the Times on
  Wednesday that national insurance will be imposed on rental income. According
  to the PA news agency, Morgan instead said he wanted the budget to be rooted
  in “Labour values”. He told Times Radio: Obviously taxation policies are a
  matter for the chancellor of the exchequer, and she will set out more detail
  in the budget later this year. I want to make sure that our budget is based on
  our Labour values, and that is what Rachel Reeves will deliver. It’s not for
  me to comment on speculation. Our focus is on driving growth in the economy
  and delivering for working people up and down the country. Speaking later to
  Sky News, Morgan said: We’re focused on growing the economy. Fixing the
  foundations of the country, restoring public service and that decade of
  national renewal. I’m afraid you will have to wait until the budget later this
  year. It was reported on Tuesday that the cost of UK government borrowing had
  jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on Reeves to reveal how she
  will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. In
  other developments, the court of appeal will hear applications for permission
  to appeal against the Epping Bell hotel ruling from the hotelier and the Home
  Office from 10am. Here is a short summary of other key events: Keir Starmer
  has appointed the outspoken founder of Octopus Energy as an adviser, with a
  remit to challenge government thinking. Greg Jackson has joined the Cabinet
  Office board, an influential core of government advisers, as a non-executive
  member. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will boycott King Charles’s
  state banquet held in honour of Donald Trump to protest against the US
  president’s failure to intervene decisively to end the war in Gaza. Davey, who
  is invited to the dinner for Trump’s state visit to the UK, said to turn down
  an invitation from the king went against all his instincts and that it was a
  deeply serious move to refuse to attend. Children and young people are being
  overdiagnosed with mental health conditions in a society that has lost sight
  of the reality that child development is “messy and uneven”, the former health
  secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. He is the latest senior figure to add his
  voice to calls for a radical overhaul of the special educational needs and
  disabilities (Send) system in England. A Reform council leader’s decision to
  ban his councillors from engaging with a prominent local newspaper is a
  “massive attack on local democracy” and a sign of things to come should the
  party form the next government, the outlet’s editor has warned. In an
  unprecedented move, Nottinghamshire county council’s four-month-old Reform
  administration has said it will no longer deal with the Nottingham Post, its
  online edition and a team of BBC-funded local democracy journalists that it
  manages.
