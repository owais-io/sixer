  The Guardian view on protests in Serbia: a battle for democracy that the EU
  must not ignore | Editorial

  During a summer in which European leaders have focused on shuttle diplomacy
  with Donald Trump over trade and Ukraine, they have maintained a discreet
  silence regarding another crisis in Europe’s east. For more than nine months,
  mass student-led protests in Serbia have been challenging the authoritarian
  rule of Aleksandar Vučić, who has been in office as prime minister and
  president for 11 years. Up to now, Brussels has largely opted to look away.
  The catalyst for some of the largest demonstrations in Serbia’s history was
  the collapse of a newly renovated railway station roof in the country’s second
  city, Novi Sad, leading to the deaths of 16 people. The disaster was widely
  attributed to entrenched fraud and corruption presided over by Mr Vučić’s
  ruling Serbian Progressive party, and swiftly became the spark for a movement
  for democratic reform. The students are demanding early elections and a new
  era of transparency and accountability, in what remains an EU candidate
  country. As anger and frustration in the streets has mounted, Mr Vučić’s
  response has become increasingly draconian. Groundlessly claiming that foreign
  agitators were seeking an “imported revolution”, the president launched a
  ruthless crackdown on civil society groups in receipt of foreign funds. On the
  streets, orchestrated mobs this month attacked protesters and reportedly
  looted businesses owned by opponents of Mr Vučić. There have been widespread
  reports of police brutality. Amid the spiral of violence, one recent
  anti-government demonstration in Belgrade took place under the slogan “Let’s
  show them we’re not a punchbag”. The protesters deserve more support and
  solidarity from the EU than they are receiving. Autocratic and cynical, Mr
  Vučić is a malign presence in the politics of the western Balkans. Beyond
  Serbia’s borders, he has long cultivated an insidious and destabilising
  ethno-nationalist agenda in relation to Kosovo and Republika Srpska – the
  ethnic Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At home, he has increasingly
  become a menace to democracy. The Organization for Security and Co-operation
  in Europe found that Serbia’s parliamentary elections last year were marred by
  media bias and the use of government patronage networks to influence the vote.
  The authoritarian response to the protests – which have spread to the
  small-town heartlands of Mr Vučić’s support – has contributed to a collapse in
  public trust in a leader who has harnessed the power of the state to serve his
  own political interests. If it wished to use it, the EU has considerable
  economic leverage to deploy. The bloc provides more than 60% of foreign direct
  investment into Serbia and has pledged €1.6bn to Belgrade by 2027, tied to
  future reforms. But Brussels is loth to see the country slip any further into
  Russia’s orbit and has, as a consequence, soft-pedalled any criticism of Mr
  Vučić. For his part, the president has played a wily geopolitical balancing
  act, sending arms via third parties to Kyiv, as well as Moscow, and granting
  the EU crucial access to Serbia’s significant lithium reserves. Following this
  summer’s violence, Mr Vučić belatedly called last week for a dialogue with
  protesters. But what Serbia needs is free and fair elections, and the reversal
  of the authoritarian creep of the past decade. At a time when the EU’s liberal
  values are being challenged in Washington as well as Moscow and Beijing, it
  needs to stand up for them far more robustly in a battle for democratic reform
  taking place just outside its own borders. Do you have an opinion on the
  issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of up to
