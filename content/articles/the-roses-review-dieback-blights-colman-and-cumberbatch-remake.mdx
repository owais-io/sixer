  Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch, the two most prestigious English
  screen actors in the world, resoundingly butt heads in this feel-bad movie; it
  is oddly, but not uninterestingly, composed throughout in feelgood romcom
  style. In casting terms, this is a Borg-McEnroe 10-set tie-break leading to
  play being suspended even as the leads bring every microlitre of their
  technique to the game. They play Ivy and Theo, two high-achieving
  professionals whose marriage becomes a black-comic Chornobyl of toxic hate; it
  is adapted from the 1981 novel The War of the Roses by Warren Adler, which was
  previously filmed in 1989 with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. Tony
  McNamara writes this new version and the director is Jay Roach, known for
  Austin Powers and Meet the Parents. Colman and Cumberbatch are acting
  black-belts and they are never anything other than watchable, but as they
  shout and wince and snap and zing their way through the dialogue, it’s
  difficult to believe that they really love each other; and then later really
  hate each other. The film loses its nerve on this latter point. The new
  version keeps a little more of the novel, in the sense that Ivy is supposed to
  be a brilliant chef, but it upends some of the original’s classic divorce
  talking points about a woman sacrificing her career for family and the
  husband’s professional status, and also therefore the traditional acrimony
  about who gets to keep the house. In this movie, Theo is an architect, not a
  lawyer, whose career collapses along with his most famous building and he
  becomes the househusband looking after the kids while Ivy becomes a globally
  celebrated foodie; she comes to despise her husband’s resentful beta-male
  loser identity and his ungrateful attitude when she bankrolls his designs for
  a new hi-tech family home. Weirdly, this sophisticated English guy is supposed
  to be fanatically coaching the kids in athletic prowess so they leave home
  early, in their mid-teens, not for college, but for some cloudily imagined
  sports institution. The children need to be got out of the way so the
  grownups’ battle can kick off, of course, but this is a peculiar and
  unconvincing contrivance, maybe there to position the couple as younger than
  in the original. (Surely people like this would have their eyes on Ivy League
  glory?) There are, of course, some nice lines. Theo says sadly: “When we were
  younger, I knew what she was going to say before she said it. Now I don’t know
  what she’s said after she’s said it.” There is a lot of angry acting and a
  fair bit of drunk acting; at one stage, Theo gets plastered on a flight to New
  York, to Ivy’s aghast embarrassment, and then she gets drunk in New York,
  finally throwing up in the bath, to Theo’s icy resentment. The difference is
  between loser-drunk and winner-drunk, but it doesn’t exactly test the range of
  these brilliant actors. Their friends Barry and Amy are played in supporting
  roles by Andy Samberg and Kate McKinnon, great comic performers who don’t get
  much funny material. Ncuti Gatwa plays a sous chef in Ivy’s cafe and Alison
  Janney is her formidably aggressive divorce lawyer. The movie has a high gloss
  and sheen, like something by Nancy Meyers, which creates a diverting
  disconnect, yet it flinches from the recognisable, tragicomic reality of a bad
  marriage. • The Roses is out on 28 August in Australia and 29 August in the UK
  and US.
