  Rising temperatures in the spring and unpredictable autumns are making the
  huge task of restoring the UK’s lost meadows even more challenging, the
  National Wildflower Centre (NWC) has warned. The centre, which is celebrating
  its 25th anniversary next month, champions projects aimed at reviving
  wildflower-rich meadows, 97% of which have been lost in the past 80 years. But
  Juliet Rose, the head of development at the Eden Project, where the NWC is
  based, said changing weather patterns due to the climate emergency were making
  it harder to find a slot to sow wildflower seed. She said: “We have seen
  sowings fail or plants showing increasing signs of distress when planted in
  spring – especially through those hot springs we had in the pandemic and this
  year. If you sow in spring the plants can fry. “When the National Wildflower
  Centre started, they would have had two clear windows in which to sow seed:
  early autumn and spring. What we have seen is an increase in the risk for
  spring plantings to fail, especially if you can’t control the watering
  regime.” This year has been particularly difficult after the Met Office said
  the UK had experienced an unprecedented season of warmth and sunshine in
  spring 2025. Rose said: “Autumn is also becoming unreliable as more
  unpredictable weather patterns have led to very wet periods, which can make it
  hard to get seed in the ground. The growing window is being squeezed at both
  ends. “Species that we see that are particularly vulnerable to climate change
  include primrose, cowslip and yellow rattle, all of which require cold periods
  in order to trigger germination. Through conversations with other growers we
  know that several of them have seen lower yields of perennial harvests this
  year as a result of the very hot spring. “We need more research to help us
  better understand and account for the impacts of climate change on wildflower
  habitat creation, in particular the impact of temperature rise and shifts in
  rainfall patterns.” The Guardian was invited to the NWC greenhouses – set on
  high ground above Eden’s giant biomes – to mark the 25th anniversary. They are
  currently drying seed harvested from a farm on the Cornish coast. Once dried,
  a machine is used to separate the wildflower seed from unwanted material. The
  seeds are sorted into sacks, with cornflower, corncockle, corn marigold and
  ribwort plantain ready to be planted out this autumn. Though the climate
  change warnings are sobering, Rose remains optimistic. The key aim of the NWC,
  founded as a millennium project, was to involve more people, from a wide
  variety of backgrounds, in restoration projects. Rose said there was a huge
  joy in broadcasting seed. “Anyone can sow seeds. It’s a way of connecting with
  other people around you and connecting with your ancestors. In the news,
  everything is going to hell in a handcart but this is something meaningful we
  can do. I’ve not met someone who doesn’t like sowing seed.” Individuals,
  communities, businesses, local authorities and non-governmental organisations
  are helped to sow wildflowers in fields, churchyards, roundabouts, business
  parks, housing estates. Projects in Cornwall include planting more than 10,000
  devil’s-bit scabious along one of the main roads to help boost the population
  of the threatened marsh fritillary butterfly. The centre has sown wildflowers
  in inner-city Liverpool wards including Toxteth, Sefton and Anfield and has
  worked with the Canary Wharf Partnership to take wildflowers to London
  Docklands. During a session in Dundee, parkrun participants stopped to grab
  handfuls of seed and scattered seed as they jogged. Sam Alford, the head of
  nature connections at the Eden Project, works with a wide variety of people on
  planting projects, including military veterans and people suffering from
  physical and mental illnesses. “You can see slumped shoulders rising, you can
  see confidence building and the excitement of seeing something grow. It’s
  wonderful.”
