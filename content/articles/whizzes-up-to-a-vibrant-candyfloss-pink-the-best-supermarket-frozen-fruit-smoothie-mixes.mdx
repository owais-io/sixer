  We’re big fans of frozen fruit in our household. My daughter eats it straight
  from the bag like sweets from a candy jar, while I love the silky texture of
  sorbet made simply from fruit and water (add banana or avocado for
  creaminess), with a one-to-one ratio of frozen fruit to liquid making a
  perfect scoopable treat. For this smoothie blend tasting, I focused mostly on
  supermarket own-brand berry and banana mixes, and blitzed them with just water
  on my blender’s smoothie setting (Love Struck is the only independent brand in
  the test). I assessed banana-to-berry ratios, and the condition and taste of
  the fruit, looking at sweetness, acidity and smoothness. Blackberry and
  raspberry blends tend to have a slightly hairy texture, which I try to ignore,
  but offer more complexity and depth, while high-banana-content blends are
  sweeter, creamier and more texturally satisfying. The mixes with a higher
  berry content seemed to be better value, not least because bananas are a cheap
  filler. Sadly, no supermarket brands were organic, which I find concerning,
  especially for strawberries, which, according to the Pesticide Action Network
  UK are among the most heavily sprayed crops. Unlike in the fresh produce
  aisle, few brands offer sourcing transparency, either. *** The best frozen
  fruit smoothie mixes *** Best overall: Sainsbury’s berry banana smoothie mix
  £2.85 for 450g at Sainsbury’s (63p/100g) ★★★★☆ This has a strawberry-dominant
  aroma with a bright, fruity flavour that’s led by sweet, ripe berries. A
  generous 70% strawberry content, giving this great flavour balance and making
  blending easier. A classic, clean smoothie base. *** Best bargain: Morrisons
  strawberry &amp; banana smoothie mix £2.50 for 500g at Morrisons (50p/100g)
  ★★★★☆ There is a fragrant strawberry aroma and a lovely, clean strawberry
  flavour with just enough banana to round it out. The 70% strawberry content is
  sliced (better for blending in a low-powered blender) and in good condition. A
  great value mix and not too sweet. *** And the rest: Love Struck
  Berry-Go-Round £4.90 for 4 x 120g sachets at Ocado (£1.02/100g) ★★★★☆ A
  striking, deep berry red blend is on offer, with a subtly sweet, complex
  flavour because of the mix of strawberries, blackberries and raspberries. This
  is the only product tested without banana. The fruit quality is excellent.
  There’s a claim of “farm-to-cup transparency”, but no sourcing details are
  provided; it’s B Corp certified and has a strong impact report available
  online, though. *** Love Struck Red, White &amp; Blueberry £4.90 for 4 x 120g
  sachets at Ocado (£1.02/100g) ★★★★☆ Bright magenta when blended, with a
  harmonious, berry-forward flavour that’s not overly sweet. A thoughtful blend
  of strawberry, grape, banana and blueberry. Fruit quality is excellent.
  Individually wrapped portions create unnecessary packaging waste, though – the
  outer box is recyclable, but the inner bags must be recycled in-store. ***
  Lidl Freshona strawberry &amp; banana smoothie mix £1.79 for 500g at Lidl
  (36p/100g) ★★★☆☆ This had a plastic aroma in the bag, but it whizzed up to a
  vibrant, candyfloss pink. Sweet with a subtle savoury edge and tang of acidity
  from the strawberries. Strawberries were in perfect condition, although
  perhaps a little under-ripe, while the bananas were slightly smushed but not
  overripe. A solid performer and good value. *** Asda summer fruits &amp;
  banana smoothie mix £1.98 for 500g at Asda (40p/100g) ★★★☆☆ A fresh berry
  aroma and, once blended, a striking magenta colour. The flavour was harmonious
  with slight banana notes and prominent strawberry and deeper berry undertones.
  Mostly berries, all in good condition. Bananas were quite ripe and a bit
  crushed, but that adds natural sweetness. A solid blend and decent value. ***
  Tesco berry smoothie mix £2.95 for 500g at Tesco (59p/100g) ★★★☆☆ Banana-y
  aroma with a rich, forest-fruit purple colour when blended. The cherries and
  redcurrants give it a lovely, complex flavour with gentle sweetness and
  balanced acidity. Some fruit was slightly bashed, but overall ripe and
  visually appealing. A nice, varied mix. *** M&amp;S strawberry &amp; banana
  smoothie mix £2.90 for 480g at Ocado (60p/100g) ★★★☆☆ A nice red blend with a
  gentle, sweet-savoury flavour. Made with 70% strawberries, which were large,
  richly coloured and in great condition, and blended seamlessly. Mid-tier
  pricing, but premium feel overall with a natural flavour profile and solid
  performance. *** Tesco strawberry &amp; banana smoothie mix £2.95 for 500g at
  Tesco (59p/100g) ★★★☆☆ Light pink once blended and not too sweet considering
  the 50:50 strawberry and banana mix. The berries were in good condition, while
  the bananas were slightly smushed but not overripe. A no-frills blend,
  although marginally pricier than some of the others. *** Sainsbury’s very
  berry smoothie mix £2.85 for 450g at Sainsbury’s (63p/100g) ★★★☆☆ A deep
  purple colour with a lovely, rich berry flavour that’s not too sweet. A broad
  mix of berries and banana, though the fruit was quite bashed up and mostly in
  small bits. A robust choice.
