  The world is burning. Fascism is rising. Countries are falling. And we’re on
  the brink of incredible technological change, which will either be the end of
  everything or a new beginning. So, who needs artists? An August night in 1944.
  Robert Colquhoun’s hand shakes as he lights a candle in the blacked-out
  Notting Hill studio shared with his lover, fellow artist, Robert “Bobby”
  MacBryde. They are known – from Soho alleys to Bond Street galleries – as the
  Two Roberts: inseparable, incandescent, often in trouble. Where is Bobby
  tonight? The Colony Room Club, probably. Safe, Robert hopes. Though never from
  himself. Bombers prowl the skies above. Who will survive the night? “Fuck it,”
  Robert mutters, fag dancing on his lip. And he picks up his brush. The Two
  Roberts were real, though in my new novel I’ve reimagined them as literary
  characters – putting flesh on biographical bones. Two young Scotsmen on the
  make, with boot-black hair, talent matched only by ambition, generosity
  surpassed only by thirst. Robert Colquhoun and Bobby MacBryde were born in
  Ayrshire just before the first world war, meeting at Glasgow School of Art
  (GSA) in 1933 then becoming stars as the bombs fell. They were the original
  “Golden Boys of Bond Street”: nicknamed MacBraque and McPicasso, which they
  pretended not to love. Photographed in Vogue and filmed by Ken Russell, they
  were twin suns. Everybody else was in their orbit, if they were lucky. At one
  of their weekend-long studio parties at 77 Bedford Gardens you could share a
  whisky with Elizabeth Smart, birl with boys from the Royal Ballet or strain to
  hear Dylan Thomas over the music. Somehow, despite rationing, there was always
  plenty to eat and drink and smoke. Bobby could feed the five thousand with one
  fish. Robert was a beguilingly brooding host. You could feast on the gossip
  for weeks. Smart would later employ them at Tilty Mill in Essex as live-in
  nannies for her four children with George Barker, the poet she fictionalised
  in By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept. They knew everybody and had
  everything then suddenly they had nothing and almost nobody and then they were
  gone. Robert dead at 47. Bobby, never far behind, at 52. Who were they? How
  did they blaze such a trail? And why are they now barely remembered? Growing
  up in Maybole, South Ayrshire, Bobby worked in a boot factory to save for
  tuition, convinced he’d get into the big art school in nearby-but-faraway
  Glasgow. In Kilmarnock, Robert was taken out of school by his father then
  returned on a scholarship by a minister who saw potential in the meticulous
  drawings his father envied. They were first in their families to get to
  university. In my novel I have them meet on their first day – each seeing
  something secret in the other. At the GSA they won every prize, the greatest
  being each other. Knowing the prodigy pair would only split any money, the GSA
  awarded them a joint travelling scholarship, sending them around Europe just a
  step ahead of Hitler. They survived street encounters with Blackshirts,
  sketched Michelangelos in Rome, got a taste for wine and had their eyes opened
  by Picasso’s Guernica in Paris. Their travel diaries, held in the GSA
  archives, smoulder with drawings of hot young priests. I fell in love with
  Bobby and Robert during lockdown. I saw a tweet of a painting of Two Women
  Sewing and the blue of the cloth stopped me – who made this? Bobby. Next I
  found Robert’s Grieving Women. These were great artists, great Scots, why were
  they not up there with Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the Glasgow Boys and that
  minister ice-skating on a million shortbread tins? Bobby becomes famous for
  his not-very-still still lifes – apples and pears dancing out their bowl, fish
  flapping on a plate. He offers the viewer a glimpse of rationed deliciousness
  and a secret taste of what he’s cooking for his man. Robert becomes famous for
  his mysterious and often tragic portraits – mask-like faces contorted in the
  mystery of mourning, often a pair of figures holding each other: one with his
  long face and the other Bobby’s low brow. They are pioneering a radical queer
  domesticity. I stumbled across them as footnotes in the biographies of people
  who used to want to be them. Soho survivors claim Francis Bacon is supposed to
  have said “Everything I learned about drawing, I learned from Robert
  Colquhoun.” Endless enraging articles describe them as “friends” or
  “roommates”: polite closeting elisions, more final than any coffin. When Bobby
  was 27 he wrote to Robert: “We must be certain to create our legends before we
  die.” By the time I discovered them they were almost forgotten. Could
  fictionalising them bring them back? Obsessing, I found them in an issue of
  the Picture Post from 1949 with Prunella Clough, Keith Vaughan, Patrick Heron
  and John Minton (Minty). Rich Minty was in love with Robert and would
  eventually move into their studio, making a couple a throuple – that’s a fun
  chapter. The Roberts’ interview is titled The Artists Who Live, Travel, Work
  and Exhibit Together. The photo, by Felix Man, shows them at their easels in
  matching shirts and ties. Robert is in a fisherman’s jumper probably knitted
  by Bobby who made most of their clothes, ironing Robert’s shirts with a spoon
  heated on their single gas ring. On the easels are Bobby’s Woman in a Red Hat
  and Robert’s Two Scotswomen – both bought by Alfred Barr, the first director
  of the Museum of Metropolitan Art and sadly no relation. On a mission to
  acquire the best young British artists, Barr’s other purchases were Bacon,
  Edward Burra and Lucian Freud. Looking at Man’s photo I found myself imagining
  the rest of their studio-high windows capturing pale north light and looking
  over to the glossy magnolia tree still growing in the garden opposite.
  Savouring the smell of pencil shavings and linseed oil. Wondering at the
  audacity of two young men building an illegal and illicit life in this one
  room. Finally standing outside their studio felt like completing a pilgrimage
  to fallen gods. Bobby and Robert were pioneers who spoke to me like prophets.
  Handsome, talented and foolhardy. Each believing in the other and making the
  other love more and paint better. Until they didn’t. Until drink and debt and
  the ceaseless memory of the horrors of war and the undeclared war on people
  like them – people like me – became too much. Like them, I arrived in London
  knowing almost nobody and wanting to be somebody – to become a writer. Just
  before the millennium, I discovered the three parallel streets in Soho: Greek,
  Frith and Dean. A world of pleasures and stories for a young man who’d grown
  up in a former pit village near a dying steel town where you could get a train
  to Glasgow and find the one gay club, if you knew where to look. I found
  freedom on the streets Bobby and Robert had danced down before my parents were
  born. Hardly any of their haunts remain but get drunk enough in Soho and
  you’ll see ghosts. I imagined them eyeing me up across a smoky bar. Every
  second person in wartime Soho was from somewhere else. So Bobby and Robert are
  lumped together by their new English friends – and subsequently by art
  historians – as “working class”. But Robert’s mother was a housewife and
  Bobby’s sold rags. The Colquhoun’s council flat still stands, Bobby’s
  childhood street was demolished. Robert’s lot were Protestant, Bobby’s
  Catholic. These differences mattered, forming fault lines that flourished in
  their work but fractured their relationship. Art was their life but also their
  work and they had the temerity to need paying, unlike their mostly monied
  pals. The Roberts spent faster than they earned – hosting parties, helping
  friends and having fun. They came from nothing. They didn’t know how to be
  rich. When art tastes changed they couldn’t afford time to experiment. The
  Roberts really did not get on with “the Bloomsberries”. In Frances Spalding’s
  book Duncan Grant she describes them as “abrasive young Scots” claiming their
  “begging letters arrived regularly”. Were they abrasive or just direct in the
  Glasgow style? Begging or just asking for what they were owed? They were
  fiercely loyal. When Bobby met Barker, who was leading Elizabeth Smart a merry
  dance, he is alleged to have ground the base of a broken whisky glass into the
  palm of his hand while purring “Pleased to meet ye”. Their Notting Hill
  neighbour Wyndham Lewis knew this, writing in an Observer review: “Robert
  Colquhoun is generally recognised as one of the best – perhaps the best – of
  the young artists. Perhaps I should have said Colquhoun and MacBryde for they
  work together, their work is almost identical, and they can be regarded almost
  as one organism.” One organism. Two Roberts. But how did they get to London
  and break into the art world? In my novel I conjure a cruising encounter in a
  blacked-out Waverley Station: Bobby picking up John Tonge, art critic for
  Horizon magazine, then showing him some etchings after. Why not? Sex and art
  are happy bedfellows. We don’t know this happened. We don’t know it didn’t. We
  do know Tonge introduced Bobby to Cyril Connolly, editor of Horizon, and Peter
  Watson, millionaire backer of the magazine, over a lunch of partridge at
  Edinburgh’s Café Royal. Bobby, ever hungry, thought they were very small
  chickens. This life-changing lunch opened a new chapter in art history. When
  lives are not valued or actively devalued – as the lives of Bobby and Robert
  and everybody like them were and often still are – they are not fully known.
  They can’t be. That doesn’t mean they weren’t fully lived. Writing to your
  same-sex lover in the 1930s was drafting your own arrest warrant. Or suicide
  note. You wrote in code, you burned letters, you memorised names and
  addresses. Or you were caught. Bobby and Robert knew many people who were
  imprisoned, or worse. Their close friend Denis Wirth-Miller was arrested for
  “gross indecency” on his way to a party at their studio and jailed for nine
  weeks – a remarkably light sentence. They collected him from the gates of
  Wormwood Scrubs. The prosecution in 1954 of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Peter
  Wildeblood and Michael Pitt-Rivers, was a national festival of bigotry. The
  laws the Two Roberts defied would not be lifted in their too-short lifetimes,
  and remained in Scotland until 1984. By then I had already been kissed by
  another boy. When the facts of our lives can never be fully known there isn’t
  just room for fiction, there is a moral imperative for it. To write it. To
  paint it – to light a candle in the dark then pick up your pen or brush. Even,
  and especially, when the world is ending. • The Two Roberts is published by
  Canongate on 4 September. Damian Barr is curating an exhibition, Robert
  Colquhoun and Robert MacBryde: Artists, Lovers, Outsiders, at the Charleston
  in Lewes gallery, from 15 October to 12 April. For details of events UK-wide,
