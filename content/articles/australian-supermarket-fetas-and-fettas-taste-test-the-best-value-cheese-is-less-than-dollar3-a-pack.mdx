  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve made a desperate salad from ingredients
  living in unexplored frontiers of my fridge. I have two usual strategies for
  transforming desperation into salvation: a good dressing and fetta. I know how
  to make a good dressing but I have no idea how to choose a good fetta.
  Whenever I’m shopping, looking at a sea of products with radically different
  textures, labels and prices, I feel as if I’m at the Björk section of the
  record store. I know there are some hits in there but pick the wrong one and
  I’ll end up with music completely unsuitable for a dinner party. To figure it
  all out, I organised a blind taste test with an Avengers-calibre team of
  experts – Tiffany Beer (the chair of judges for the Sydney Royal Cheese and
  Dairy Produce Show); Penny Lawson (professional cheese judge and owner of
  Penny’s Cheese Shop); Petra Sugiarto (microbiologist and professional cheese
  judge), Timothy Cassimatis (Greek chef and owner of Olympic Meats) and Alex
  Grenouiller (owner of Marani Deli). We gathered at Marani Deli in Sydney and
  tasted 22 cheeses – pretty much anything I could find packaged with the word
  feta or fetta on it (feta has to be produced from sheep and goats’ milk in
  Greece, everything else is fetta). The cheeses were divided into five rounds
  based on their labels – Greek, Persian, marinated, Danish and other. Here’s a
  brief guide to help you understand the differences: Greek or Greek-style: The
  feta of your expectations. With one notable exception (more below), you can
  buy any cheese labelled Greek or Greek-style and improve your salad, pastry or
  last-minute potluck contribution. Persian: The term and the product are
  Australian inventions. They’re generally extremely soft and very salted, and
  because of that they can’t withstand a salad toss or a recipe that requires
  any subtlety. The better brands, Emporium and Yarra Valley, make good spreads.
  Because they are neither feta nor, as the taste revealed, a useful substitute
  for it, the “Persian” fettas have been cut from the fetta rundown below. But
  if you’re looking for a salty cheese spread, we have included their scores at
  the end of the article. Marinated: There are plenty of good products in the
  wider category of oil and herb marinated soft cheeses (Meredith Dairy is a
  producer many of our reviewers like) but none of them identify as fetta – I
  would not recommend the two brands that do. Danish: Danish fetta is typically
  smoother, whiter and milder than Greek but, much like in the salami world, in
  Australian supermarkets “Danish” seems to carry as much meaning as “gourmet”.
  Smooth: A few brands make several versions of the same thing: a smooth and a
  Greek-style. The former are closer to fresh cheeses than the typical salty,
  acidic feta experience. It’s a perfectly usable product but, like many of the
  categories above, it’s a different thing. The best Dodoni Feta Authentic Greek
  Cheese P.D.O., 150g, $7.50 ($5 per 100g), available at large supermarkets
  Score: 8.5/10 There were no wows when this hit the table, no gasps when it hit
  our taste buds. Just nods of agreement, as if each person was silently
  thinking, yep, this is about right. Dodoni’s feta isn’t a masterpiece – you
  usually need something new or genre-breaking for that. Instead, it is a genre
  standard. It does everything you need it to do and it does it well. It
  crumbles predictably; it’s neither dry nor overly wet; it has an acidic,
  almost lemony edge; it’s evenly seasoned; and, it’s creamy without being oily.
  The only reviewer who didn’t award this best of the day was me – I gave that
  honour to South Cape. The best value Emporium Selection Greek Style Fetta
  Cheese, 200g, $2.89 ($1.45 per 100g), available at Aldi Score: 7/10 There are
  some lucky people out there who can buy the best-quality things on earth in
  every category but everyone else has a threshold beyond which they will
  compromise quality for price. What discount do you need to go from a cheese
  that ticks every box to one that ticks most boxes? Emporium’s fetta may be a
  little dry with a fermenty aftertaste, but for the price of Dodoni you can get
  two of these and change. The rest South Cape Greek Style Fetta, 200g, $6.50
  ($3.25 per 100g), available at large supermarkets Score: 7.5/10 I’ve never
  seen a supermarket product that needs a rebrand more than South Cape. Here we
  have the most pop culture approach to cheese making, absent of anything
  countercultural and packed with crowd-pleasing attributes: creamy, salty,
  lemony, mild and affordable. It’s delicious – I can’t imagine anyone not
  liking it. Even its Danish fetta is decent. But its products are packaged like
  just-add-water camp meals, and because of that, I’ve never picked them up. But
  here I am giving it the top score in a taste test. It’s a bit embarrassing,
  but at least now I know. South Cape, you deserve my respect, and I hope you
  get your Brendan Fraser moment. Lemnos Fetta Traditional, 180g, $6.50 ($3.61
  per 100g), available at large supermarkets Score: 7.5/10 “Not so special but
  very nice!” wrote one reviewer. It reminded me of a kid who went to my high
  school. You know, the one who never does anything wrong but never does
  anything memorable either. It’s probably a boring way to live but it gets you
  places. So, sorry Lemnos, you’re perfectly pleasant and if we ever do mingle,
  we’ll probably have a nice time, but I’m not going to think about you again
  and, frankly, I’d much rather hang out with Brendan Fraser. Weirdly, Lemnos’s
  smooth and mild iteration has much more character. Reviewers said it tasted
  like cooked cream and olive brine (it’s very salty) but with an almost cream
  cheese texture. “Not the worst but very weird,” one reviewer said. Riverina
  Dairy Co Greek Style Fetta, 200g, $4.70 ($2.35 per 100g), available at large
  supermarkets Score: 6.5/10 If Lemnos is the quiet achiever, Riverina is the
  handsome but prickly exchange student. It’s rich, sour and oddly spicy – both
  this version and Riverina’s smooth variety reminded me a lot of rich yoghurt
  and fermented milk drinks such as ayran, doogh and kefir, which I love (I was
  interested to see cream listed in the ingredients, the only brand that does).
  The problem is the texture. It’s solid, dry and chalky, as though it has been
  mixed with some building material. It’s unlikely to improve a salad but it
  would be interesting melted into pasta. Epiros Original Feta, 180g, $8.69
  ($4.83 per 100g), available at select grocers Score: 6.5/10 Epiros sells two
  Greek fetas: one organic, one not. Both scored 6.5. The regular edition model
  is decent texturally – soft without being particularly creamy – but it has a
  bitter edge and a stale aroma, like a cupboard that houses family memorabilia.
  Like many organic dairy products, the organic iteration feels
  barnyard-inspired, smelling and tasting as though it was aged where the dairy
  herds sleep, eat and mate. Both versions are plastered with claims about
  authenticity and their Greek origin. The non-organic one says: “The most
  award-winning feta in the world.” I would love to know more about those
  awards. I’m particularly interested in finding out if they have a food writing
  category. Maybe my next byline could say “the most award-winning writer in the
  world”. The Cheese Board Danish Fetta, 335g, $10.99 ($3.28 per 100g),
  available at select grocers Score: 5.5/10 This is a beautiful cheese. It’s
  whiter than Sofía Vergara’s smile and plump and soft enough to provide
  comfortable bedding for a small mammal. The texture is exactly as you’d expect
  from its appearance but, as soon as you try it, all you’ll think about is the
  nearest water supply. Among all the reviewers, the only notes about the taste
  were “milky”, “tangy” and “some milky acid notes but overwhelmed by the salt”.
  I spent the round imagining the people who made this. How many times did they
  taste it and think, “Nope, that should be saltier”? Evrofarma Authentic Feta,
  200g, $6.99 ($3.50 per 100g), available at select grocers Score: 5/10 I am
  fascinated and repulsed by this contestant. The first thing that hit me was a
  powerful creamy taste, like a savoury, thick dairy concentrate. But that
  quickly gave way to a worryingly bitter, sour flavour so unusual that more
  than one reviewer described it as “compost”. I can’t imagine what you’d do
  with this. Usually, cheese is used to make a salad taste less grassy, not
  more. It’s the only Greek feta I wouldn’t eat again. Alba Cheese Fetta, 175g,
  $6.99 ($3.99 per 100g), available at select grocers Score: 4/10 Professional
  cheese judging requires all judges to carry neutral expressions as they eat
  the cheese. There were no poker faces during this round, just looks of disgust
  and awe. One of the judges spent the entire round laughing. I spent it
  confused. Why is this fetta so hard? Why is it astringent? Why can’t I pick up
  any acidity? How is this even saltier than the Persian and Danish styles we
  tried? Is it possible to drink too much water? Why is the aftertaste so
  buttery? One reviewer gave it zero for every category, writing only:
  “Horrible, tastes like plastic.” Products cut for brevity: Riverina Dairy Co
  Smooth Fetta 7.5/10 Emporium Selection Classic Persian Style Fetta 7.5/10
  Yarra Valley Dairy Persian Fetta 7/10 Lemnos Smooth Fetta Mild 6.5/10 Thomas
