  Ten years ago, after the Iran nuclear deal, I wrote in the Guardian about the
  urgent need for global nuclear disarmament – starting with the establishment
  in the Middle East of a zone free from weapons of mass destruction. A decade
  later, as our region teeters on the edge of catastrophe, that call is no
  longer just noble – it is essential. The proposal was not a new Iranian
  initiative. As far back as 1974, Iran proposed a zone free from nuclear
  weapons in the Middle East at the UN, and was soon joined by Egypt. That
  proposal passed overwhelmingly in the general assembly. After Iraq’s use of
  chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, the initiative was expanded in 1990
  to cover all weapons of mass destruction. But for half a century, progress has
  been blocked by Israel and its main patron, the United States. This paralysis
  is no accident. Despite overwhelming annual support in the UN general assembly
  and repeated commitments in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), the
  Middle East remains one of the only regions on Earth without a nuclear
  weapon-free framework. More than 100 non-aligned states at the 1995 NPT review
  and extension conference made progress towards such a zone a condition of the
  treaty’s indefinite extension. Yet 30 years on, little has changed. In fact,
  the situation has deteriorated, showing that while possession of nuclear
  weapons usually leads to reckless adventurism, such weapons in no way assure
  success, provide invincibility or safety for citizens. Recent unlawful
  military action by the nuclear-armed Israel – which is not party to the NPT –
  against Iran’s internationally monitored nuclear facilities brought our region
  dangerously close to an abyss. The failure of Israel to achieve its
  unwarranted objectives, and the inability of the US to bring Iran to its
  knees, could and still can engulf this region and by extension the entire
  world in a forever war. Enough is enough. We must take the future of our
  region’s security into our own hands. It is time for the Middle East and north
  Africa to move beyond empty rhetoric and towards genuine regional cooperation
  – based on mutual respect and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. That is why
  we propose the creation of the Middle East Network for Atomic Research and
  Advancement, or Menara, which fittingly means “lighthouse” in Arabic. Menara
  would be a regional body designed to facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation
  among its members. Open to all qualified states in the Middle East and north
  Africa, to join, countries must reject the development or deployment of
  nuclear weapons and commit to mutual verification of their compliance. In
  return, Menara would help them benefit from peaceful nuclear technology,
  including energy production, medicine, agriculture and scientific research.
  Such a body is not a substitute for disarmament – it is a step towards it.
  Regional nuclear cooperation, with strong safeguards and mutual oversight, can
  strengthen non-proliferation and enhance energy security without enabling
  militarisation. It has long been argued that progress on regional disarmament
  must wait for Israel to disarm. But a regime that has shown no regard for
  international legitimacy by committing international crimes such as apartheid,
  genocide and, most recently, mass starvation will hardly be influenced by this
  negative pressure – it certainly has not been for more than 50 years. And its
  perilous nuclear arsenal has been and will always remain the gravest threat to
  international non-proliferation and regional and global peace and stability.
  Holding hundreds of millions of people hostage to one regime’s nuclear arsenal
  and political impunity is a recipe for permanent instability. We must find a
  new way forward. Menara would also help reframe the nuclear debate in the
  region. For too long, nuclear issues have been cast solely in terms of risk
  and threat. But nuclear science also offers solutions – to the climate crisis,
  water scarcity, food security and energy diversification. As oil and gas
  reserves dwindle, nuclear energy will be vital for regional growth and
  sustainability. Menara can make this future a shared, secure reality. Here’s
  how it would work. Menara would coordinate research, education and development
  across member states. It would support joint ventures in fields ranging from
  uranium enrichment and waste management to nuclear fusion and medicine.
  Members would share facilities, pool expertise and ensure transparency through
  a joint regulatory board. Contributions would be proportional to each
  country’s capacity, but every member would benefit. The network would be
  headquartered in one of the participating countries, with branch offices and
  potentially shared enrichment facilities in others. Oversight would be
  conducted by a board of governors composed of national representatives, with
  international observers from the UN, the security council and the
  International Atomic Energy Agency invited to participate. Crucially, Menara
  would include robust mutual safeguards to prevent the diversion of materials
  for military use. Today, more than ever, we in the Middle East and north
  Africa region have been woken up to a collective cognisance of the horrifying
  picture of our future unless we seize this moment. We know that mistrust runs
  deep in our region. Iran has its grievances and so do others. But history must
  not define our destiny. We call on the nations of the Middle East and north
  Africa to endorse Menara and begin formal negotiations on its structure,
  mandate and membership criteria. A regional summit – under the auspices of the
  UN and with support from global powers – could lay the foundation. Such a step
  would not only reduce the risk of nuclear conflict but also offer a model for
  cooperation in a fractured world. The status quo is unsustainable. The
  nightmare of escalation and its inherent potential to cause proliferation is
  no longer hypothetical; it is dangerously close to becoming real. But there is
  still time to choose a different path. Menara can be a beacon guiding us
  towards a future where the Middle East is no longer a battleground for nuclear
  brinkmanship, but a leader in peace, progress and responsible energy. The time
  to act is now. Javad Zarif is associate professor of global studies at the
  University of Tehran. He was Iran’s foreign minister and chief nuclear
  negotiator from 2013-21. His co-author is Mohsen Baharvand, who was Iran’s
