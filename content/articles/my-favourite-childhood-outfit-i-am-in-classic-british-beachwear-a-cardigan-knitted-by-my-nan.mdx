  My favourite childhood outfit: ‘I am in classic British beachwear – a cardigan
  knitted by my nan’

  I inherited my hands from my nan. Long and slim with hard but feminine nails,
  we called them “piano fingers”, though neither of us ever learned to play.
  While I went on to use mine for writing, my maternal grandmother dedicated
  hers to knitting. Decades before the Sewing Bee or Tom Daley’s Instagram,
  Barbara would go to the local wool shop for designs and supplies – everything,
  right down to tiny buttons. As her first born granddaughters, my elder sister
  and I were the natural beneficiaries of this skill, willing mannequins covered
  in glitter glue and nostalgia. When I look back at photos of myself until
  around the age of six, I realise I’m usually in knitwear. This commitment to
  wool was not limited by season or location: in my early years, whenever I was
  photographed on a beach, I was wearing a cardigan as the waves splash at my
  feet, like an influencer promoting swimwear for people with hypothermia.
  Before my parents had a car, my mum, sister and I would regularly drive to the
  seaside with my grandparents while my dad was at work. In the summer of 1989,
  when I was four years old, we made the more than 200-mile journey to
  Bournemouth from Lincolnshire. There is one photo from the trip that I always
  remember. I am wearing a classic British beach outfit: shorts, a blouse,
  sunglasses, and, of course, a cardigan. Its thick, sky-blue knit fastened
  across my chest, the cardie is colour coordinated down to a packet of cheese
  and onion crisps. Surrounded by a striped windbreaker and a red bucket and
  spade, I am sitting on a foldable chair secured in the holes my grandpa made
  in the sand. At that point, I didn’t yet have a wheelchair and made do with an
  NHS-grade buggy; cumbersome and immobile on beaches (though I later learned
  wheelchairs were little better). The metal folding chair, with a generic
  cartoon figure on the back, regularly accompanied me on these trips. Blond
  pigtails and a nonchalant leg tilt, my eyes hidden by heart-shaped glasses, I
  have the air of a queen looking over her kingdom, dressed in her favourite
  robe. I didn’t know it at the time, but this would be the last summer before
  school, when the grinds of life would begin. A few weeks after this photo was
  taken, I would start reception class; the sand castles swapped for spellings.
  Over three decades later, I can’t help but envy the girl on the sand. Those
  fleeting days when clothes were knitted by our nans, potential stretched out
  before us with the tide, and all there was to think about was the next bag of
  crisps.
