  On Tuesday, the United States commander-in-chief weighed in on one of the most
  pressing issues facing our nation: the rebranding of a restaurant chain. Last
  week, Cracker Barrel, a Tennessee company whose nationwide locations lean
  heavily on a cozy, old-timey aesthetic – “rocking chairs on the porch, a warm
  fire in the hearth, peg games on the table” – announced it was updating its
  logo. Uncle Herschel, the man who once appeared next to the letters with a
  barrel, was gone. It sparked ire on the right, with Donald Trump Jr leading a
  charge against the rebranding: “WTF is wrong with Cracker Barrel?!” Later,
  Trump Sr weighed in, suggesting the company “admit a mistake”. Businesses
  change their logos all the time – and there was nothing noteworthy about the
  bland new image. So why did Cracker Barrel’s shift prompt such anger on the
  right? It starts with the company’s position in the popular imagination.
  Cracker Barrel is “part of the cultural landscape”, says Neeraj Bharadwaj,
  Proffitt’s professor in marketing at the University of Tennessee’s Haslam
  school of business. “It’s an institution.” The new logo was part of an effort
  to reach younger customers with a sleeker, more contemporary look. But such an
  update conflicts with the company’s image. Founded in 1969, the restaurant is
  known for its southern comfort food, including fried chicken and biscuits and
  gravy; antique decoration; and general store items such as old-fashioned
  candy. “It has this kind of stylized or idealized representation of what I
  think many would define as the ‘good old days’,” says Jarvis Sam, founder and
  CEO of the Rainbow Disruption and professor of the practice at Brown
  University and University of California, Berkeley. “But for others, its
  imagery of histories of exclusion, of racial inequity, and this
  romanticization of a time that was not that great, actually – it was not
  equally safe and nostalgic for everyone.” The Cracker Barrel case was a kind
  of “proxy for the larger culture war that’s being developed around who
  actually owns the American story”, Sam says. “Because people feel so connected
  and entrenched with the nostalgia of some of these experiences, it leads to
  backlash when there is change,” he adds. That, of course, made it an easy
  target for political figures who stand to benefit from the culture war. “At
  best, it’s political theater,” says Sam. Leaders leveraged a minor change at a
  chain restaurant to deliver their message – including the idea that “woke
  culture is problematic and will create threat to the American society, and a
  devolution of what we understand to be traditional American history”. Cracker
  Barrel has a dark history of its own. In 1991, the company declared it was
  founded “on concept of traditional American values” – which were inconsistent
  with employees who failed “to demonstrate normal heterosexual values”. It
  fired 11 LGBTQ+ workers, leading to protests. It appeared to back down on the
  statement, though activists said the workers had not been rehired and bought
  stock to pressure the company. It added sexual orientation to its
  nondiscrimination policy in 2002. Two years later, however, the chain paid
  $8.7m to settle 40 plaintiffs’ claims of racist treatment of Black customers
  and discrimination against Black workers. Allegations across 16 states
  included denial of service and segregation of Black diners, the use of racial
  slurs and serving food out of the garbage. The plaintiffs’ lawyer called the
  settlement “good closure to a bad period”. Amid the latest controversy, the
  loudest voices calling for change have been on the right – but they seem to
  have penetrated the wider American consciousness. Seventy-six percent of
  respondents to a YouGov poll said they preferred the old logo, and the
  backlash was enough to sink Cracker Barrel’s value by almost $100m and draw a
  quasi-apology, with the company saying on Tuesday it “could’ve done a better
  job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be”. That statement appeared to
  suggest the company was sticking with the change, but later in the day, it
  acquiesced: Uncle Herschel, it seems, is sticking around. On Wednesday, shares
  rose 8%. So what is the business lesson in all this? For one thing, says Sam,
  it suggests that “whatever market research they did, did not include the
  majority of their consumers” – if it had, the company would have been prepared
  for this response. Instead, the company suffered a self-inflicted wound by
  “trying to celebrate the design change and show that they’re adapting to the
  times”, says Bill Pearce, a continuing professional faculty member at UC
  Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. A slow, careful rollout would have been
  safer; still, going back on the plan just made things even more complicated.
  “It feels like dear leader has expressed an opinion, so we must support dear
  leader,” he says. That may not play well with the 50% of Americans who did not
  vote for Trump. “If they believed in the design, they should have stuck with
  it, and if they retrenched so quickly, well, that’s an indication that they
  didn’t believe in the design and probably shouldn’t have gone ahead in the
  first place,” Pearce says of Cracker Barrel. “They’re blowing with the wind.”
  It’s reminiscent of the 1985 New Coke debacle, in which Coca-Cola released a
  new formula only to withdraw it within 77 days and return to the “classic”
  one. Of course, that was a customer uprising, not a political one – the soda
  crisis somehow did not make it to the top of Ronald Reagan’s agenda. Which
  raises a bigger question: “If, five years ago, a senator had come out with a
  statement on this, they would have been excoriated by their own party” for
  weighing in on the behavior of a private company, Pearce says. “Where’s the
  outrage that the president of the United States even notices this?”
