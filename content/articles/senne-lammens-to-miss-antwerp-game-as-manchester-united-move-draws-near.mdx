  Senne Lammens is set to miss Royal Antwerp’s match against Mechelen on Sunday
  due to his €20m (£17m) proposed transfer to Manchester United. The current
  plan is that the 23-year-old goalkeeper has been stood down from the Pro
  League fixture, which kicks off at 12.30pm, with United expecting his move to
  become official imminently. Ruben Amorim wants to sign Lammens as competition
  to André Onana, who has been United’s No 1 but has come under scrutiny. While
  the Cameroonian is believed to have travelled to west London for Sunday
  afternoon’s Premier League game at Fulham, his starting place is in the
  balance. The 29-year-old Onana was left out of the squad for the opening-day
  loss to Arsenal last weekend. His replacement, Altay Bayindir, made an error
  that directly led to Riccardo Calafiori’s winning goal at Old Trafford. Onana
  expects to remain at Manchester United beyond the current transfer window,
  having been made aware that the club have rebuffed inquiries from other clubs
  for his services – but he is now poised to face further pressure for his place
  from Lammens. Lammens is a 6ft 3in Belgium Under-21 international who made his
  senior debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years
  later. His first appearance for the club was that November, in a 2-0 Champions
  League defeat by Porto. Bayindir currently earns around £80,000 per week, so
  if Lammens does join United, he can expect a similar salary. Onana is also
  likely to miss part of the season because of his involvement in Cameroon’s
  Africa Cup of Nations campaign in Morocco.
