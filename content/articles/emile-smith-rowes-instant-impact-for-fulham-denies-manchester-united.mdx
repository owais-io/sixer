  Ruben Amorim’s first response to Manchester United executives’ attempts last
  autumn to woo him was to ask to wait until the summer, granting time and space
  to know the club and players. This August’s season-opening matches were
  supposed to be the start, when he could be properly judged. Instead, he is
  already nine months into the job that enveloped five predecessors. Initial
  positive signs gave way to the muddle United closed last season within,
  casting a hungover shadow over attempts at a full reboot. After Rodrigo
  Muniz’s own-goal, claimed by Leny Yoro, Craven Cottage became that nine months
  in microcosm, Amorim’s team incapable of putting their opponent away. Bruno
  Fernandes’s uncharacteristic first-half penalty miss was redolent of a team
  full of psychological as well as tactical and personnel problems. United began
  well enough, only for confidence to drain as a capable, muscular opponent met
  their measure. Once ahead, by those rather fortunate means, they failed to
  protect their lead, Emile Smith Rowe stealing in to equalise; Fulham deserved
  their share of spoils. How long is a developmental phase allowed to take at a
  club of such short patience? Amorim awaits the shifting of his “bomb squad” to
  free transfer money to fit his specifications. Thus, Altay Bayindir continued
  in goal, André Onana travelling to London to sit on the bench. Antwerp’s Senne
  Lammens may soon be his competitor and replacement. Mason Mount at false No 9
  suggested Benjamin Sesko remains short of readiness, while Luke Shaw’s
  selection in a central defensive trio reminded United are short in that
  position. As a club doing minimal transfer business so far, Fulham at least
  retain a settled look. Muniz, Fulham’s saviour last week at Brighton, started.
  The expectation is the Brazilian stays, Atalanta’s interest cooled. As at
  Brighton, Josh King was trusted by Silva for the ball-carrying, darting runs
  that impressed again. Matheus Cunha, a hit against Arsenal, who scored two
  superb goals for Wolves last November at the Cottage, might have scored twice
  in his new team’s rousing start, first driving just over the bar, next
  striking a post from Mount’s stabbed pass. Such momentum continued when
  Fernandes’ skidding shot forced a Bernd Leno save, Cunha forcing Leno to make
  an even better save. When would United’s first goal of the season come? Leno
  was only adding to a growing sense of frustration. By then, Fulham signs of
  danger, King sent away, Bayindir’s slidden save a fillip to fragile
  confidence. From Fulham’s first corner, another test of nerve, and a smother
  of Alex Iwobi’s shot. From the second came a flap, Bayindir nowhere near the
  ball as he stumbled. It is hardly a positive sign when any ball near a
  goalkeeper draws gasps. Bryan Mbeumo’s battle with Calvin Bassey was one where
  Fulham’s man had the upper hand throughout. Mbeumo, a considerable physical
  specimen himself, constantly struggled with Bassey’s wardrobe-like bulk and
  deceptive pace. Bassey versus Mount was far less of a fair fight and United
  were awarded a video-assisted penalty for a challenge that, on second
  inspection, resembled the clearing out of a rugby union ruck. Perhaps that
  inspired Fernandes to lash the spot-kick over the bar when his usual technique
  is to stroke the ball home. Amorim did not dare to watch the kick, hardly
  suggesting much confidence from the manager. Leno was at least forced to make
  a save from Amad Diallo’s shot in United’s first attack of the second half.
  The interchanges of passing were often neat enough, the execution never quite
  there. On the sidelines, Sesko warmed up, and was introduced as part of a
  double change, Diogo Dalot coming on, too, Mount dropping backwards to replace
  Casemiro. Joachim Andersen’s robust challenge of the first 50-50 soon let
  Sesko know he faced a fearsome physical battle. Running at the back post,
  perhaps the giant Slovenian proved a distraction for United’s scrambled goal.
  From a corner it also appeared Yoro had given Bassey a push, to further reduce
  the popularity ratings of Chris Kavanagh, the referee. Marco Silva’s own
  changes proved decisive in the equaliser. From Iwobi’s cross, Raúl Jiménez’s
  fresh-air shot served as a decoy for Smith Rowe to steal in past a flat-footed
  Matthijs de Ligt, Bayindir left helplessly unprotected. That left 15 minutes
  plus a winner to be found, with Smith Rowe, much improved from last season,
  likeliest to find the spark as Fulham pushed onwards. Sesko, meanwhile, was
  struggling to get a touch as Andersen remained limpet-like. Shades of United
  last season came as Harry Maguire was thrown on as a late sub, as United
  forced a series of corners, one the central defender climbed highest above the
  melee to nod wide. Next, it was Fulham’s turn to produce a set-piece threat,
  the early evening sun creating more problems for United’s defence, One
  free-kick turned into a chase between Mbeumo and Tete towards Fulham’s goal,
  and a corner in added time saw Bayindir in no-man’s land, only for Andersen to
  miss his cue. A match low on sophistication had been reduced to a physical
  wrestle, doing little to point towards the promised progressive future for
  Amorim’s United.
