  If continuity is key to Ryder Cup success, even the phlegmatic Luke Donald
  must be doing cartwheels. This also applies to those who believe the
  occasional away win is necessary if the event is to remain within the realms
  of serious sporting contest. The European class of 2025 is now very close to
  replicating the one that won in Rome in 2023, but with one quirk; Rasmus
  Højgaard replacing his twin brother, Nicolai. What the United States would
  give for such a settled scenario. Should Donald be so minded, he can keep
  change to an absolute minimum. Recreating a winning environment becomes so
  much easier when the characters involved are the same. When Europe slumped to
  comprehensive defeat at Whistling Straits four years ago, seven of the 12-man
  team were sampling an American Ryder Cup for the first time. At Hazeltine, in
  2016, half of Darren Clarke’s European contingent were debutants. The US again
  won with ease. Tommy Fleetwood suffered heartache in Memphis on Sunday. There
  was the consolation of qualification for Bethpage at the end of September.
  Fleetwood has joined Rory McIlroy and a reinvigorated Justin Rose as
  guaranteed to be in the team. Robert MacIntyre and Tyrrell Hatton are sure to
  follow. Shane Lowry may knock Sepp Straka out of the six automatic berths –
  the Austrian has withdrawn from this week’s PGA Tour stop in Maryland for
  family reasons – but both will be in New York. Below Straka and Lowry in the
  rankings come Rasmus Højgaard, Ludvig Åberg, Viktor Hovland, Matt Wallace and
  Matt Fitzpatrick. The rogue element for one of those inside the top dozen on
  the European points table is that Donald is sure to turn to Jon Rahm, whose
  move to the LIV Tour has distorted his place in the world rankings and
  automatic qualifying potential. Rahm posted two top-10 finishes in this year’s
  majors and earned three points for Europe in Rome. There is a reason the legal
  challenge from Rahm and Hatton towards the European Tour Group for fines
  issued for playing on LIV has been kicked down the road until after the Ryder
  Cup – Donald wants both on his team. Long before the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles
  in 2014, Paul McGinley sensed Victor Dubuisson would be in European colours.
  The Frenchman was a maverick, an outlier. McGinley quietly built a
  relationship between Dubuisson and the man who would become his Ryder Cup
  partner, Graeme McDowell. The assimilation process was successful, but
  lengthy. Donald has no such problems. There is, however, scope for at least a
  modicum of late drama. It seems logical to assume that if European qualifying
  stopped now, Rahm would take the place of Wallace, who sits 11th. Wallace will
  have a final opportunity to give Donald food for thought at next week’s
  British Masters. Should Wallace, who has spoken candidly about the pain of
  missing out on the Ryder Cup in 2018, prevail or even go close at the Belfry
  it would make others vulnerable. Wallace tied for third when the US PGA
  Championship stopped at Bethpage in 2019. As a rookie, Wallace would have to
  give Donald undeniable cause to pick him. Looking at the names in the frame,
  that appears a simple case of making himself a better option than Højgaard.
  The big-hitting Dane enjoyed a wonderful end to 2024, but has not properly
  built on that position of strength. This week’s DP World Tour event in Denmark
  feels big for the twin. Fitzpatrick, doubtless aware of Wallace’s potential to
  surge, has the British Masters on his schedule, as has Højgaard. Fitzpatrick,
  12th in the standings, is a major champion and previous top 10 in the world
  player who lost his way spectacularly in the early part of this year.
  Fitzpatrick’s rebound has been impressive, recently involving a batch of high
  finishes on either side of the Atlantic, including a share of fourth at the
  Open. Fitzpatrick is still involved in the FedEx Cup playoffs and will tee up
  this week at Caves Valley. For Donald, these are all relatively trivial
  issues. Every player he needs in the Bethpage picture is already there. In
  McIlroy, he also has an on-course leader with a stated aim of assisting Europe
  to a win in the US long before he clinched a career grand slam. Such a hugely
  incentivised McIlroy is a dangerous McIlroy. Fevered discussion on the US side
  surrounds the possibility, indeed the likelihood, of Keegan Bradley operating
  as a playing captain. The dual role need not be anything close to the disaster
  some insist, but the lack of clarity around how precisely Bradley became the
  captain and his definitive plan if qualifying to play has been striking. Those
  outside the US top 12 include Patrick Cantlay, Brian Harman, Cameron Young,
  Sam Burns, Wyndham Clark and Jordan Spieth. Brooks Koepka, the US PGA champion
  in 2019, has regressed towards irrelevance since winning the same major in
  2023. Bradley has far bigger, far more profound decisions to make than his
  European counterpart. Bryson DeChambeau has matured as a player in six years,
  but as Koepka triumphed at Bethpage, his compatriot missed the cut. The US can
  call upon Scottie Scheffler, modern golf’s immovable object. They also command
  the home advantage ordinarily so crucial when these teams joust. Europe have
  strength in other forms. The stability offered to Donald only increases
  already high European hopes.
