  Trump-Putin talks

  European leaders stressed the need to keep pressure on Moscow and protect
  Ukrainian and European security interests after Donald Trump and Vladimir
  Putin arranged to meet in Alaska next week. A joint statement from French,
  Italian, German, Polish, British and Finnish leaders and the president of the
  European commission welcomed the move but noted that the “path to peace in
  Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” and that negotiations could take
  place only in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities. It
  added: “only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine
  and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed”.
  They also said a resolution “must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital
  security interests”, including “the need for robust and credible security
  guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and
  territorial integrity”. US vice-president JD Vance met British foreign
  secretary David Lammy and representatives of Ukraine and European allies on
  Saturday at Chevening House, a country mansion south-east of London, to
  discuss Trump’s push for peace. A European official confirmed a
  counterproposal was put forward by European representatives at the Chevening
  meeting but declined to provide details. The Wall Street Journal said European
  officials had presented a counterproposal that included demands that a
  ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken and that any
  territory exchange must be reciprocal, with firm security guarantees. “You
  can’t start a process by ceding territory in the middle of fighting,” it
  quoted one European negotiator as saying. The White House did not immediately
  respond when asked about the European counterproposals. Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday rejected the idea that his country would give
  up land to end the war with Russia after Trump suggested a peace deal could
  include “some swapping of territories.” Zelenskyy said Ukraine “will not give
  Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give
  their land to the occupier.” Later, Zelenskyy called the Chevening meeting
  constructive: “All our arguments were heard,” he said in his evening address
  to Ukrainians. “The path to peace for Ukraine should be determined together
  and only together with Ukraine, this is key principle.” French leader Emmanuel
  Macron stressed the need for Ukraine to play a role in any negotiations:
  “Ukraine’s future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been
  fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now,” he wrote on
  X after what he said were calls with Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich
  Merz and Starmer. “Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as
  their own security is at stake.” On Saturday two people died and 16 were
  wounded when a Russian drone hit a minibus in the suburbs of the Ukrainian
  city of Kherson, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Two others died
  after a Russian drone struck their car in the Zaporizhzhia region, according
  to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Ukraine’s air force said it intercepted 16
  of the 47 Russian drones launched overnight, while 31 drones hit targets
  across 15 different locations. It also said it shot down one of the two
  missiles Russia deployed. Russia’s defence ministry said its air defences shot
  down 97 Ukrainian drones over Russia and the Black Sea overnight and 21 more
  on Saturday morning.
