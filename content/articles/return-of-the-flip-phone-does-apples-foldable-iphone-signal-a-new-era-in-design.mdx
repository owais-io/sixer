  Return of the flip phone: does Apple’s foldable iPhone signal a new era in
  design?

  Back in 2005, nothing felt more high-powered and sophisticated than ending a
  call by snapping shut a clamshell flip phone. Now, two decades since they hit
  peak popularity, they’re back – with Apple rumoured to be working on its first
  ever flip phone. Little is known about how it will look. It could resemble
  Samsung’s Flip design – closer to a 2000s-style clamshell phone – or its Fold,
  more like a foldable iPad. A JPMorgan report has suggested that the first
  foldable iPhone will be revealed in September 2026, priced at $1,999 (£1,474),
  and will likely expand a foldable phone market expected to reach 19m units in
  2025. The rectangular tablet has been a mainstay of phone design for the last
  15 years, but could Apple betting on the flip phone be a sign that’s about to
  change? Tech experts said the new product launch probably reflected the fact
  that people now mostly access the internet on their phones, rather than
  laptops or tablets, and are looking for a device that optimises that
  experience – but the high price point suggests it will remain a premium
  product. “Apple and all other smartphone makers are somewhat stymied by the
  fact the smartphone has become somewhat of a boring category – it’s absolutely
  essential in people’s daily lives, but it no longer has the excitement of the
  next big thing,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at the tech consultancy CCS
  Insight. This is why Apple has been reaching for new designs that can get
  people talking – for example, the ultra-thin iPhone, expected to be launched
  in September. Wood thinks Apple is entering the foldable market because other
  companies have experimented first. Samsung’s initial Galaxy Fold designs were
  bedevilled by screen problems, but last month’s Galaxy Flip and Fold 7 triple
  release, featuring slimmer designs and bigger screens, are expected to
  represent the “next generation” of foldable phones, which Samsung will be
  hoping reverses the flatlining sales in 2024. “Apple is rarely first to
  anything – it’s not typically a company that dives in with both feet – it
  likes to take its time, see how it can refine and optimise it, and deliver the
  best, most reliable experience, then it jumps,” Wood said. He noted that
  Samsung’s flip phone has been more popular than the fold model “because it’s
  cheaper and has captured imagination of the population who like the idea of
  having something different from everyone else”. But he thinks that Apple
  producing a foldable mini-tablet has the most potential to “move the needle”
  by giving people the opportunity to unfold a larger screen where they can
  easily watch videos, show off photos and browse documents when working
  remotely. Margarita Panayiotou, a tech researcher at the University of
  Manchester, said academic research had identified that people prefer bigger
  screens for browsing and gaming. This, combined with the fact that young
  people, especially, tend to use smartphones to go online, suggests that the
  foldable design could offer an ideal compromise for future consumers. Prof Ben
  Carter, who researches how smartphones impact our lives at King’s College
  London, agreed that video watching was “one of the wins” for foldable phones,
  especially since videos constitute a growing proportion of the content that
  people consume. Foldable phones can have larger screens and can also be
  propped up for easier viewing. He thought there could be mental health
  benefits to a design resembling a “mini-laptop that you can close down”. His
  research shows that disabling notifications is highly effective in reducing
  screen time and tackling smartphone addiction. If the screen is not visible,
  it removes the “variable reward scheme” – the same process by which gambling
  addiction works, whereby not knowing when you will receive a reward makes
  something more compelling. “If you can switch it off, more like a laptop, that
  distraction has gone,” he said, though he noted there was not yet evidence
  that people are using foldable phones in this way. This might be especially
  beneficial for children, who receive on average more than 200 notifications a
  day – though the high price point of foldable phones makes it unlikely that
  many will have access to them until their parents pass on secondhand models
  several years after launch. Prof David Ellis, the chair of behavioural science
  at the University of Bath, said that other draws include the fact that screens
  are better protected and fit into a smaller pocket, as well as the “sense of
  nostalgia that comes with a flip phone”. But he added that it might not be the
  gamechanger people are expecting: Apple doesn’t have a “100% success rate –
  the Vision Pro [headset] has been a spectacular failure”. • This article was
  amended on 18 August 2025. An earlier version mistakenly referred to “next
  week’s Galaxy Flip and Fold 7 triple release”, when those phones were released
  last month.
