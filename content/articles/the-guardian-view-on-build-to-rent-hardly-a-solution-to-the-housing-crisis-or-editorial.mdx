  To an outside eye, English cities might seem deliberately designed to foment a
  housing crisis. Unconstrained by craggy topography or fortified ramparts,
  their Victorian developers built endless streets of low-rise terraces. Cities
  that expanded during the Industrial Revolution are less dense than their
  European equivalents and have far fewer flats. Their private rental sectors
  are fragmented, dominated by small-time landlords for whom property ownership
  is often a second career. In recent years, large investors have begun
  bankrolling high-rise apartment blocks that promise to create the type of
  housing that English cities need. These “build-to-rent” developments are
  transforming the skylines of Manchester and London, and have added about
  14,000 new homes each year since 2020. For a Labour government that hopes to
  build 1.5m homes, the sector’s growth looks like a blessing. Clive Betts, the
  Labour MP who chairs a build-to-rent taskforce, has described such
  developments as “good-quality housing with a real future”. Labour’s pledge to
  “build, build, build” rests on the idea that supplying more homes will make
  housing more affordable. If only it were so straightforward. The housing
  researcher Adam Almeida recently found that in Brent, Ealing and Newham,
  London boroughs with the greatest number of these rental property
  developments, rents have increased by 48% to 52% since 2015, exceeding the
  city-wide average. Brent saw the highest rise. The borough is home to
  Britain’s largest build-to-rent development, in Wembley. Two-bedroom flats at
  this outer London development are priced between £2,471 and £3,370 per month.
  It is plausible that other landlords in the area may have seen these prices,
  and raised theirs accordingly. Build-to-rent is attractive to governments
  allergic to public spending. The coalition government was keen to encourage
  the sector, commissioning a 2012 review that found such developments were
  already taking off overseas and in UK student housing. Evidence from both
  contexts is mixed. Residents in Amsterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen have accused
  large investors of helping to fuel the housing crisis, while newly built
  student apartments in Britain are often unaffordable for British students. The
  cheapest room at the Edinburgh branch of IQ, one of the UK’s largest student
  housing groups, currently costs £10,717 for a year’s term-time accommodation;
  the typical annual Scottish maintenance loan is £8,400. The companies behind
  these schemes argue that they can offer tenants a better service. Many provide
  luxurious amenities. Given the choice between on-site dog spas and genuinely
  affordable housing, however, it seems likely that most tenants would choose
  affordability. Polling by YouGov in 2024 found that support for rent controls
  vastly outnumbered opposition. But such limits, of course, are antithetical to
  investors’ bottom line. Even in European cities with rent controls, new
  apartment developments are frequently exempted from them. Labour’s housing
  plans risk sacrificing real affordability by relying on investors who
  naturally prioritise their own returns. A corrosive legacy of Thatcherite
  policy was the evisceration of genuinely affordable social housing through
  right to buy. While local authorities can technically borrow to build more
  homes, tenants are still allowed to buy these at a significant discount.
  Labour plans to reform (but not scrap) this policy. Its proposals for
  affordable social housing remain hazy. Until it delivers, renters will
  continue getting squeezed.
