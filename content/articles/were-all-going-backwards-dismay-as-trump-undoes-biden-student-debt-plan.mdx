  When Faith, a 33-year-old in Burlington, North Carolina, went back to get her
  master’s degree in higher education administration in 2020-21, she hoped it
  would accelerate her career growth and maybe even help her get on the housing
  ladder. Now, Faith has federal student loan debts of $38,113, and a repayment
  schedule that is much more demanding than she realized so she feels like the
  program stalled her progress. “I wasn’t aware of the detriment it would have
  on my future,” she said. “You really don’t know the full scope of what you’re
  getting into [when taking out student loan debt] … I got my master’s
  specifically to progress in my career, but what I make now versus what I owe
  on the degree, it’s almost like it doesn’t make sense.” She added: “I always
  regret that decision.” Faith’s situation has been made worse by the Trump
  administration’s move to resume charging loan interest for borrowers under the
  Saving on a Valuable Education (Save) plan as of 1 August. Under the Biden
  administration, about 8 million people enrolled in the Save plan – a 2023
  income-driven repayment plan for student debt – many of whose loans have been
  in forbearance since last year. Under Donald Trump, the Department of
  Education has effectively killed the Save plan, recommending people switch to
  another repayment plan for their federal student loans. Borrowers can still
  choose to forgo payments, but will see interest accruing on their loans and
  won’t make any progress toward student loan forgiveness. “To me that just
  looks like you’re digging me deeper into debt, so I felt like I had no other
  choice but to go ahead and change from the Save plan and start making those
  payments,” Faith said. Faith is one of scores of people who got in touch with
  the Guardian to share how they will be affected by changes to the Save plan.
  Her new repayment plan means she must find an extra $300 a month, on top of
  her rent of $1,200 (before bills and living costs), a financial challenge that
  feels “very overwhelming” and has put everything else on hold. “Luckily I
  don’t have any dependents … but all the people in their 30s around me, it
  feels like we’re all going backwards,” Faith said. “I’m scared for what the
  future looks like, especially as we get older. Does that mean, unlike our
  grandparents whose homes were paid off and who were free of debt, that we’re
  just going to be in debt?” Public school teacher Jennifer, a 34-year-old based
  in Portland, Oregon, with $63,419 in federal student loan debt, is also
  leaving the Save plan, but said her monthly payments almost doubled in her new
  repayment scheme from about $250 to $480. “I don’t understand why it’s so
  high,” she said – but she has to leave the Save plan in order to make progress
  towards loan forgiveness for public school teachers. Jennifer wants to have
  children in the next couple of years, but said she was “scared for my family
  plans” under such difficult financial pressures. Alongside teaching in public
  school, she babysits and runs a weekly bar trivia night in order to earn extra
  cash to make a living. “The [Trump] administration claims to be pro-family,
  but is screwing a lot of people over – including ones with families, including
  ones who want to build a family,” she said. After changes to the Save plan
  were announced, Jennifer was forced to ask her parents for financial support
  to help pay off her car loan, which felt difficult as a 34-year-old woman, the
  age her mother already had two children. “I’m really lucky to be in the
  position” to ask for help, she said, but added that “there’s so many Americans
  who don’t have access to generational wealth in that way, and so many teachers
  who don’t – and we wonder why the teaching field is so white, so
  unrepresentative. It’s so expensive to be a teacher.” Sedona, a 30-year-old
  lawyer in Seattle, Washington, who has federal student loans worth $170,848,
  will be staying in the Save plan, despite the loan interest resuming. She is
  “much more afraid of defaulting on private debt”, which is currently $22,413
  in loans co-signed with her mother, she said. Despite Sedona earning a good
  wage as an associate lawyer, she and her partner still “live paycheck to
  paycheck” and already keep a hawkish eye on their finances. As a household
  they have cancelled most of their subscriptions, very rarely go on trips like
  to the movies or for nights out, and Sedona picks up sporadic gig work such as
  copy editing to supplement their income. “In my therapy sessions, we talk a
  lot about how so much of my anxiety and issues are tied to financial
  concerns,” she said. “It’s kind of like always sitting there, as this heavy
  weight.” Sedona feels that the Trump administration’s decision to in effect
  kill the Save plan aggressively punishes those already in often severe levels
  of debt, while it simultaneously gives lavish tax giveaways to wealthy
  individuals and corporations. One day Sedona and her partner would like to
  adopt or foster children but they currently cannot see a future in which it
  would be financially responsible to do so. “It feels like, when do I get to
  start living my life?” she said. “We’re a generation of people who feel
  jilted.” In Aurora, Colorado, 46-year-old Chris is also remaining in the Save
  plan. He said he had about $50,000 in outstanding student loan debts – down
  from $65,000 – that he accrued while studying a bachelor’s degree in
  hospitality management. He’s keeping his federal student loans in forbearance
  and paying the interest for as long he can, in order to prioritize paying
  other debts. “It’s not that I don’t intend to pay my students debts, I
  understood it was a loan like any other to be repaid,” he said, but the
  “repayment costs need to be able to fit in a budget that allows for personal
  and professional growth”. It feels to Chris as if the Trump administration
  wants to “keep those with [student] debt in it for as long as possible”. “My
  hope is that midterm elections will bring about government leaders that will
  undo this mess, that is where my vote will go,” he said.
