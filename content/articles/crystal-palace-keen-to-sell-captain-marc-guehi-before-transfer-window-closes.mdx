  The Crystal Palace chair, Steve Parish, has admitted that they are looking to
  sell their captain, Marc Guéhi, in this transfer window to avoid potentially
  losing him for nothing next summer. The England defender has entered the final
  12 months of his contract at Selhurst Park and is wanted by a number of
  Premier League teams, including Liverpool and Newcastle. It is understood that
  Arne Slot’s side – who lost against Palace on penalties in the Community
  Shield on Sunday – is Guéhi’s preferred option, although they have so far been
  reluctant to pay Palace’s £40m valuation. Newcastle failed with multiple bids
  in excess of £50m for the 25-year-old last summer, while Tottenham had an
  offer worth up to £70m rejected by Palace in January. But when asked if they
  would be willing to allow Guéhi to leave this month if they receive a suitable
  offer, Parish acknowledged that they could not afford to allow him to run down
  his contract. “We’d have to do that, of course,” he said. “For players of that
  calibre to leave on a free, it’s a problem for us unfortunately. [Last summer]
  Joachim Andersen] went [to Fulham] and we couldn’t afford to lose both. We
  then had another bid in January but that was a different situation. We’ll just
  have to see what happens. But, you know, it needs a new contract or a
  conclusion of some kind.” Guéhi is understood to be willing to stay at
  Selhurst Park and see out his contract if necessary. He will be able to sign a
  pre-contract agreement with clubs outside England in January, while Eberechi
  Eze has also attracted interest from Arsenal in this transfer window. “As far
  as people being here or not being here, it depends,” Parish said. “If it’s the
  right decision for the football club and for them, nobody can make anyone go,
  then there’ll be some changes.” Oliver Glasner has been critical of Palace’s
  lack of activity in the transfer market so far but Parish insisted that he
  will do his best to back the Austrian manager after delivering the club’s
  second piece of silverware in the space of three months. “I admire Oliver so
  much. He just wants to win trophies and football matches,” he said. “The
  Premier League is kind of crazy, the money that people spend and the kind of
  financial jeopardy that people take. So I have to look at everything around
  [that]. We’ll do everything we can in the next few weeks to give ourselves the
  best chance. But at the end of the day, the amount of money we’ve got isn’t
  infinite.” Parish also said he was hopeful that Palace’s appeal to the court
  of arbitration for sport against their demotion to the Europa Conference
  League will be successful. The hearing was held in Lausanne on Friday, with a
  decision expected on Monday afternoon. “It’ll be good to put it behind us,” he
  said. “I’m determined that we get the right outcome – if we don’t, we’ll have
  to look at if there’s any steps after that. But after Friday, I don’t
  understand how we cannot be in the competition.”
