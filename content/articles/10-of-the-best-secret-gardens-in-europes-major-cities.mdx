  El Capricho Park, Madrid El Capricho, on the outskirts of Madrid, is one of
  the city’s lesser-known parks. It was built in 1784 by the Duke and Duchess of
  Osuna, and visited by 18th-century artists such as Francisco de Goya. Its
  17-hectare gardens were designed by Jean Baptiste Mulot, who also worked on
  the Petit Trianon gardens at the Palace of Versailles. They are in three
  sections: Italian, French and English landscape. The park also has a small
  lake, a labyrinth, a bandstand and a mansion. One fascinating feature is an
  underground bunker, built in 1937 during the Spanish civil war – there are
  free guided tours at weekends. Open weekends and public holidays, 9am-9pm,
  April to September, then 9am-6.30pm, October to March, esmadrid.com Onion
  Garden, London You’re never far from a garden in London: 20% of the city is
  public green space, including about 3,000 parks, and it became the world’s
  first National Park City in 2019. As well as eight royal parks and vast areas
  of greenery such as Hampstead Heath, the city has numerous hidden havens. One
  of them is the tiny Onion Garden near Victoria Station and St James’s Park.
  According to the tour guide Jack Chesher, it was a “derelict concrete corner”
  until late 2021, when it began to be transformed into the “hanging gardens of
  Westminster”. The pocket park now has more than 200 species of plant –
  including a fair few onions – and displays artworks such as mosaic wall art
  and sculptures. There is a cafe and events including singing, craft workshops
  and poetry recitals. Open weekdays 7.30am-5.30pm (until 10pm on Thursdays),
  weekends 8.30am-4.30pm, theoniongarden.org Anne Frank Garden, Paris This
  little-known walled garden, found down a dead-end road in the Marais, once
  belonged to the Hotel de Saint-Agnan. The hotel is now the Musée d’Art et
  d’Histoire du Judaisme (mahJ), and the garden, dedicated to Anne Frank, is
  open to the public. The central plot dates to the 17th century, and there is a
  small orchard, vegetable garden, pergola and children’s play area. Most moving
  is the chestnut tree, planted in 2007 from a graft of the tree Anne looked at
  from her window in Amsterdam and wrote about in her diary. As well as the
  mahJ, the Pompidou Centre is a short walk away. Open 10am-9pm in summer,
  paris.fr Brera Botanical Garden, Milan Hidden behind the south wall of the
  Palazzo Brera in the centre of Milan is an ancient medicinal garden. Humiliati
  priests grew plants and meditated here in the 14th century, followed by the
  Jesuits. In 1775, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria ordered it be turned into a
  botanical garden, and it has been managed by the University of Milan since
  1935. The 5,000sq m garden still has its original layout: two oval ponds; an
  arboretum containing two centuries-old Ginkgo biloba trees and other exotic
  specimens; and themed flowerbeds (medicinal, Mediterranean, plants used for
  dyeing, textiles, paper …) Open 10am-6pm, Monday to Saturday, until 31
  October, then 9.30am-4.30pm, until 31 March, ortibotanici.unimi.it
  Centralbadets Garden, Stockholm Right in the middle of Stockholm, off the main
  shopping street of Drottninggatan, is a hidden courtyard garden. In the 18th
  century, it was the garden of the farm where the architect Carl Hårleman lived
  – two of the pear trees are thought to date from this period. Another
  architect, Willhelm Klemming, bought the property in 1901, renovated the
  garden and built the Centralbadets in 1904 – still an affordable day spa
  today. The lush little garden has a pond with a water sculpture, flowerbeds,
  winding paths and shady places to sit. There are three adjacent restaurants,
  all with outdoor tables. Closed at night, parker.stockholm The Garden of the
  Royal Library, Copenhagen Hidden between Christiansborg Palace and the Royal
  Library in a historic part of central Copenhagen is a tranquil public garden.
  The garden was built in 1920 on top of Tøjhushavnen, an old naval port.
  Reminders of this maritime past include a pond in the middle of the garden,
  with an eight-metre-high column that shoots a spout of water every hour on the
  hour, and an old mooring ring at one end. There is also a statue of the Danish
  philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, whose manuscripts are in the library’s
  collection and occasionally go on display. There are benches under the trees
  to sit quietly with your own book. Open 6am-10pm year-round,
  visitcopenhagen.com Károlyi-kert, Budapest Tucked away in District V, in the
  inner city, the Károlyi-kert is thought to be Budapest’s oldest garden, and
  contains Hungary’s oldest mulberry tree. It was once the private garden of the
  Károlyi Palace, and has been a public park since 1932 (don’t be deterred by
  the forbidding-looking iron railings). It is a mix of styles: geometric
  central flowerbeds and fountain, and English-style paths and plant
  arrangements. There is a children’s playground and a statue of a beloved late
  resident: Károly, a Belgian giant rabbit. The wine bar and restaurant Csendes
  Társ is next to the park and has outdoor tables right outside the gate. Open
  8am-9pm in summer, welovebudapest.com University Library Roof Garden, Warsaw
  The landscaped garden on top of the University of Warsaw’s library is one of
  the biggest roof gardens in Europe, at more than a hectare (2.5 acres). It
  opened in 2002 and remains a little-known escape from the busy Powiśle
  district. A gentle slope leads to the lower garden, which has a duck pond and
  a series of granite sculptures. The upper garden is divided into four
  colourful sections: gold, silver, red and green. The areas are connected by
  paths, bridges and pergolas, and a cascading water feature joins the upper and
  lower parts. The garden has panoramic views of the Warsaw skyline. Upper
  garden open from April to October, lower garden open year-round, en.uw.edu.pl
  Vrtba Garden, Prague Although it is close to sights such as Charles Bridge and
  Lesser Town Square, this terraced garden on Petřín hill is hard to find.
  Visitors who seek it out are rewarded with baroque beauty. The Italianate
  garden was created around 1720 on the site of Vrtbovský Palace’s former
  vineyards. Three terraced platforms, connected by steps, are full of
  hornbeams, yews, and tens of thousands of flowers and shrubs. The gardens are
  decorated with statues, vases and paintings, and a ceremonial lighting event
  is held twice a year. From the pavilion on the top terrace, there are views of
  the castle, cathedral and old and new towns. £5 adults/£4 children/£15
  families, open 10am-7pm, April to October, prague.eu Diomedes Botanical
  Gardens, Athens The National Garden in central Athens is a well-known
  attraction, but the city also has a lesser-known botanic garden, a 20-minute
  bus ride away. Most of this vast, 186-hectare (460-acre) green space is left
  as a natural habitat, but 11% (about 20 hectares) is cultivated and contains
  more than 2,500 plant species. Visitors can walk through the arboretum, with
  trees from most continents; the ornamental plants section, with 15 flowerbeds
  and 25 ponds; the historic plants sections, with species recorded by ancient
  Greeks; and many more – medicinal and aromatic plants, plants of economic
  importance, hothouse plants, rare plants … There is also a small cafe. Open
  weekdays 8am-2pm, weekends and holidays 10am-3pm, closed in August,
  diomedes-bg.uoa.gr • This article was amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier
  version said that Károlyi-kert was in the palace district of Budapest;
  however, it is in District V.
