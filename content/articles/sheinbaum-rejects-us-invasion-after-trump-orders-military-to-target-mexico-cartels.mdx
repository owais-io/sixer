  Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has rejected the idea that the US might
  invade Mexico after news reports suggested Donald Trump had authorized the use
  of military force targeting drug cartels deemed terrorist organizations in
  Latin American countries. “The United States is not going to come to Mexico
  with their military,” she said during a daily news conference on Friday. “We
  cooperate, we collaborate, but there will be no invasion. It’s off the table,
  absolutely off the table.” The Mexican president said her government had been
  informed of the executive order but insisted that “it had nothing to do with
  the participation of any military or any institution on our territory. There
  is no risk that they will invade our territory.” Mexico’s foreign ministry
  later said it “would not accept the participation of US military forces on our
  territory” after the US embassy in Mexico released a statement saying both
  countries would use “every tool at our disposal to protect our peoples” from
  drug trafficking groups. News of Trump’s secret directive to the Pentagon was
  first reported by the New York Times, which cited people familiar with the
  matter, and noted that the order “provides an official basis for the
  possibility of direct military operations at sea and on foreign soil against
  cartels”. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the move would enable the
  US government to use the military to target trafficking organizations. “It
  allows us to now target what they’re operating and to use other elements of
  American power, intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, whatever …
  to target these groups if we have an opportunity to do it,” Rubio said. “We
  have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug
  dealing organizations.“ Trump has made going after Latin American
  drug-trafficking organizations a top priority of his administration: in
  February, the state department designated seven organized crime groups as
  foreign terrorist organizations, including five powerful cartels in Mexico. At
  the time, the White House claimed these groups constituted “a national
  security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime” with
  activities including “infiltration into foreign governments across the Western
  Hemisphere”. It is unclear how much impact that designation has had, as US
  agencies already have a range of tools to target transnational organized crime
  groups by restricting their members’ abilities to travel or do business. But
  the designation would widen the range of potential targets for prosecution to
  include anyone who provides “material support” to the cartels. The Trump
  administration has also deployed thousands of active-duty combat troops, as
  well as drones and spy planes to the south-west US border in order to crack
  down on the northward flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl, as well as staunch
  the flow of immigrants. This latest order would represent a profound and
  unprecedented escalation of tactics by the US government in Latin America,
  potentially opening the door for unilateral American military assaults across
  the region. Jack Riley, former deputy administrator of the Drug Enforcement
  Agency who helped lead the capture of the drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo”
  Guzmán, welcomed the Trump administration’s directive, having long been a
  proponent of designating cartels as terrorist organizations. “This to me is
  the next logical step,” said Riley. “It probably opens up avenues for training
  our counterparts, additional funding obviously, and puts some teeth into the
  federal agencies that are operating overseas.” Still, Riley cautioned that
  Trump’s order may face obstacles at home before troops can even set foot
  overseas. “You’re probably going to have some legal challenges in the US to
  his authority to do this without congressional approval,” he said. “But that
  doesn’t seem to bother him.” In Mexico, however, security analysts feared the
  move would not only be ineffective at eliminating drug-trafficking groups but
  also prove devastating to US-Mexico relations. “It’s not a welcome
  development,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, head of the North American
  observatory at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.
  “And beyond the narrative, it seems to me that once again there’s been a
  misdiagnosis of these illicit markets and how we can weaken and dismantle
  them.” The news comes at a delicate time for US-Mexico relations, with Mexico
  in the midst of negotiating a tariff deal with the Trump administration as
  well as a new security agreement, which Sheinbaum had said was close to being
  signed. Mexico and the United States have often cooperated closely on
  security, including during the Mérida Initiative back under former President
  Felipe Calderón. But even then, said Farfán-Méndez, US boots on the ground was
  seen as a red line. This new move by the Trump administration would
  potentially cross that line – with devastating impacts on the countries’
  relationship. “It would have very serious consequences, where Mexico would
  stop cooperating,” she said. “This does seem to me like it would lead Mexico
  to ask, ‘what’s the incentive to collaborate with you? If you’re going to take
  unilateral action anyway?’”
