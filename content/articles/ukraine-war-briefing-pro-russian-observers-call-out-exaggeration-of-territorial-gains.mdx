  territorial gains’

  The influential Russian war observers known as “milbloggers” have rounded on
  the defence ministry and the army chief Gen Valery Gerasimov for exaggerating
  battlefield progress in Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of
  War (ISW). Gerasimov claimed on 30 August that Russian forces had seized 3,500
  sq km of territory and 149 settlements since March 2025. “ISW has observed
  evidence to assess that Russian forces had gained only roughly 2,346 sq km of
  Ukrainian territory and seized 130 settlements” in that time, said the US
  thinktank. The ISW said Russia’s “territorial gains remain disproportionately
  limited and slow relative to the high losses incurred”, and because of this
  the Kremlin was intensifying a propaganda campaign to influence western
  decision-making: accusing European states of prolonging the war, making
  nuclear threats, and claiming that Russian victory in Ukraine is inevitable.
  Russia is believed to have jammed the GPS signal of a plane carrying the
  European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, over Bulgaria, write
  Jennifer Rankin and Oliver Holmes. The plane landed safely anyway. The
  commission deputy spokesperson Arianna Podestà said the Bulgarian authorities
  suspected Russia: “Of course, we are aware and used to … the threats and
  intimidations that are a regular component of Russia’s hostile behaviour.”
  Interference with satellite navigation has become increasingly common in
  airspace near Russia, especially since its full-scale war on Ukraine. Heads of
  state and government of the European-led “coalition of the willing” will meet
  on Thursday to “discuss work on security guarantees for Ukraine carried out in
  recent weeks and take stock of the consequences to be drawn from Russia’s
  attitude, which stubbornly refuses peace”, the French presidency announced on
  Monday. France will host the virtual meeting of about 30 countries. A civilian
  was killed in a Russian airstrike on the city of Bila Tserkva, said Mykola
  Kalashnyk, the Kyiv region’s governor, on Tuesday morning. “A body of a man
  was discovered while firefighters were putting out a fire at a garage complex
  that got on fire as a result of the attack. Damage has been reported across
  multiple parts of the city. Windows in several multi-storey residential
  buildings were shattered and fires broke out in [several] areas.” Separately,
  a Russian drone attack started a large fire in the Zarechny area of Sumy city,
  local officials said; and port facilities came under attack in the Izmail area
  of Odesa. Russian artillery shelling killed a 73-year-old man in his yard on
  Monday, said Ukrainian authorities in the Kherson region; while a 14-year-old
  girl and a 50-year-old person were hospitalised with injuries after drones
  attacked private homes in the Chernihiv regional city of Horodnia, according
  to the regional administration. Ukrainian authorities said Russia was linked
  to the weekend assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a 54-year-old former speaker
  of parliament and leading figure in the pro-European protest movements of 2004
  and 2014. A 52-year-old suspect has been arrested in Lviv, where the shooting
  took place. “We know that this crime was not accidental. There is a Russian
  trace in it,” said Ivan Vygivsky, the national police chief, on Monday.
  Ukraine’s interior minister, Igor Klymenko, said: “I will only say that the
  crime was carefully prepared: the schedule of the deceased’s movements was
  studied, the route was laid and an escape plan was thought out.” Ukrainian
  parents started the school year on Monday by sending their children
  underground. About 17,000 children in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv,
  a frequent target of Russian attacks, are attending seven such schools, with
  more set to open. Anastasia Pochergina, whose child was beginning their first
  year, said: “The school is three floors down, and we were told it is the
  deepest school in Kharkiv. That’s why I believe it is safe. We did not expect
  it would be possible this year, but as a parent, I was desperate for my child
  to be able to attend normal school.”
