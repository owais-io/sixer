  Friday was supposed to be a celebration of one of rugby league’s greatest
  coaches. But following the Roosters’ 40-10 defeat of the Storm, Craig Bellamy
  was not amused. After watching the worst half in Melbourne’s history, during
  which his team completed just five sets after half-time, giving up a 10-point
  lead and conceding 40, he was better described as enraged. Once known as rugby
  league’s human explosive, Bellamy said at his press conference this week that
  he had mellowed. But watching him on the television cameras pace furiously
  around an empty dressing room after full-time, it was the Bellamy of old.

  then had to walk out onto the field and address the crowd and receive a
  memento for his 600th game. Behind him a sign reading CB600 was on fire to
  mark the occasion, but there was steam coming out of Bellamy’s ears when he
  approached the microphone, and he dropped the f-bomb to make his feelings
  known. “It was embarrassing actually, to be quite honest, to go out there,” he
  said afterwards. Just over the road in the Melbourne Park precinct, Cirque du
  Soleil was under way. The show featured Mauro, a dreamer clown, imagining his
  funeral as a festive carnival with angels. At AAMI Park, here was the game’s
  most serious man, watching the season of his premiership favourites take a
  sharp turn towards its grave. “I thought we’d done a really good job in the
  first half, but it was like a different team in the second half,” Bellamy
  said. “I really can’t say how disappointed I am in that performance and
  especially coming at this time of the year. It’s ah … yeah.” While the trapeze
  might have been advertised for John Cain Arena, the real acrobatics were to be
  found in the south-western corner of AAMI Park. There, during an extraordinary
  second half, Mark Nawaqanitawase crossed four times – including two exquisite
  elevated putdowns – to move into first in the NRL try-scoring race with 20.
  Storm’s winger, Xavier Coates, previously had the lead, but was one of several
  Melbourne players rested with a top two spot all but secured, including
  captain Harry Grant and prop Josh King. Still, an almost full house of Storm
  fans came, though their numbers streaming out of Richmond station were diluted
  by those on the way to Cirque du Soleil. Among them was a group of four in
  their 20s, in bowties, suspenders and evening gowns. One could be overheard
  discussing the merits of rugby league. “I’ve only watched a few games, but I
  understand it,” he said. The matches in this penultimate round of the regular
  season, however, make little sense. On Thursday, the four-time
  premiership-defending Panthers, unrecognisable after 16 changes, succumbed
  meekly to the previously listing Bulldogs. Then on Friday, the Warriors failed
  to reel in the lowly Eels despite a roaring home crowd, leaving the top four
  open for the Broncos – who welcome Melbourne in a pivotal clash next Friday.
  And can our well-dressed young gentleman please help out with what to make of
  this Roosters side? Two weeks ago they looked destined for the finals having
  reeled off three straight. Then they lost to the Eels last week, and the gloom
  returned. Against the Storm, they may have been missing playmaker Sam Walker
  due to concussion, but their lineup was one others could envy. A rejuvenated
  James Tedesco at fullback, a pack full of rep players and twin weapons on the
  wings. Of course, they proceeded to give away seven penalties in the first
  half of a match that was looking like their season’s own funeral. Melbourne’s
  makeshift defensive line was superb in the first half, but the Roosters looked
  out of ideas and at half-time they were pointless in more ways than one. Then
  they emerged from the tunnel a different side. In almost everything was
  Nawaqanitawase, who snuck the ball inside the corner flag twice despite diving
  defenders. Storm chief executive, Justin Rodski, suggested this week the next
  Melbourne Park statue should be of Bellamy. But when a weaving Nawaqanitawase
  left Grant Anderson at a standstill for his fourth try, the Storm already had
  one. With the Storm’s defeat, the Raiders can secure their first minor
  premiership since 1990 with a win against the Tigers at a full GIO Stadium on
  Saturday. The Roosters will enter their local derby against the Rabbitohs next
  week knowing a win will be enough to make the eight – if they aren’t already
  secure by the end of the weekend – in what promises to be a marquee conclusion
  to their regular season. Their coach Trent Robinson wants them to fully absorb
  the buildup. “We’re human beings, we understand what it means when those two
  jerseys play each other, and the week will be great,” he said. But he himself
  was more measured after the game, a clear contradiction with his players who
  had spent much of the previous 40 minutes hooting and high-fiving. “You don’t
  get giddy, the job’s not over, though you can feel I’m really proud of the
  guys,” he said. “But also there’s next week, there’s always next week. Until
  there’s not.”
