  Leaders of more than 60 countries have been plunged into a fresh race to
  secure trade deals with the US after Donald Trump unleashed global chaos with
  sweeping new tariff rates. Trump’s latest blitz triggered a wave of market
  jitters and fears for jobs in some of the poorest countries, as tariff rates
  were signed off ranging from 50% to 10%. There was a minor reprieve that
  opened the door to further negotiations, after the White House said the
  updated tariffs would take effect on 7 August, not on Friday, the deadline
  previously set by Trump. The new rates, which Trump sees as benefiting US
  exporters, create uncertainty for dozens of countries, including longtime US
  allies. They have also raised fears of inflation in the US. Rates were set at
  25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa.
  Switzerland faces a rate of 39%. The deadline for a tariff deal with Mexico
  was extended by another 90 days. Stock markets fell on both sides of the
  Atlantic, after earlier falls in Asia, amid investors fears about the impact
  on the global economy. Europe’s Stoxx 600 was down nearly 2% while the UK’s
  FTSE 100 was down 0.8%. Wall Street closed lower, with the Dow Jones, S&amp;P
  500 down over 1% and Nasdaq down more than 2%. The sell-off was exacerbated by
  weaker than expected jobs figures in the US. Switzerland and chip powerhouse
  Taiwan are scrambling to negotiate deals after being hit by rates of 39% – one
  of the highest in the world – and 20% respectively. Canada’s prime minister,
  Mark Carney, said his government was “disappointed” by Trump’s decision to
  increase US tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35% with immediate effect –
  on the grounds Canada had failed to crack down on fentanyl and to increase
  border security. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said he would use
  the week to “negotiate as strongly and as hard as we can” to reduce a
  crippling 30% duty on goods. Some of the world’s poorest and struggling
  countries were hit with punitive rates, including Syria, which faces a levy of
  41%. Laos and Myanmar were hammered with rates of 40%; Libya, 30%; Iraq, 35%
  and Sri Lanka 20%. Would-be EU member states were blindsided by punitive
  rates: Moldova 25%, Serbia 35% and Bosnia and Herzogovina30%. There was some
  reprieve for Lesotho, a country that Trump described a state that “nobody has
  ever heard of” when halting USAid. It was facing 50% tariffs, an existential
  threat to its textile industry but came out on Friday with a 15% rate.
  Lesotho’s $2bn economy is heavily dependent on duty-free exports to the US.
  The tiny African country declared a national state of disaster after the 50%
  rate was declared. The Swiss franc touched its weakest in six weeks after
  being hit with one of the highest tariffs in the world, 39%, while the
  Canadian dollar was set for a seventh straight weekly loss. Karin
  Keller-Sutter, the Swiss president, who was celebrating the country’s national
  day, said she had spoken to Trump on Thursday but that “no agreement could be
  reached”. Pharma accounts for 50% of Swiss exports to the US, which may have
  been Trump’s target. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said
  Switzerland got the rough end of Trump’s trade war. “The Swiss rate was a
  shock, and the Swiss government have said that they plan to keep negotiating
  with the US to secure a lower levy. Chocolatiers, watchmakers and pharma
  companies are all under threat,” she said. Conspicuous as the only two trading
  partners listed at a 10% rate were the UK, the first to get a deal with Trump,
  and the Falkland Islands. The EU’s 15% tariff rate as a single all-inclusive
  rate was confirmed in the executive order. In a setback to the EU, cars were
  left out in the executive order. They are currently being taxed at 27.5%, with
  many EU car companies resuming deliveries to customers in the US after last
  Sunday’s deal with Trump. The new specific rates will apply seven days after
  the date of the executive order, starting on 8 August. For goods already in
  transit or warehoused for consumption before 8 August, the previous tariff
  rate (10% + MFN rate) will apply until 5 October 2025. Pharmaceuticals were
  conspicuous by their absence, given the White House said it had agreed a 15%
  rate on Monday, hours after Trump sealed the deal with the EU at his Scottish
  golf course. Pharma chiefs, who have been in Trump’s crosshairs for months,
  were warned to reduce their prices to US patients by the US president. If they
  refused to, the federal government would “deploy every tool” in its arsenal to
  protect American families, the White House said. Brazil’s tariff rate was set
  at 10%, but a previous order placed a 40% tariff on to punish the country for
  prosecuting its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Cambodia appeared to be
  close to reaching a deal after it said it would drop all tariffs on imports
  from the US and order up to 20 Boeing 737s.
