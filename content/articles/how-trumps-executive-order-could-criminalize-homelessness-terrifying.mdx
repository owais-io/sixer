  Donald Trump’s executive order that pushes local governments to remove
  unhoused people from the streets will exacerbate the issues already facing
  people who have unstable housing, mental health conditions and substance use
  disorders – and the vague wording could be used for wider action, experts say.
  “It’s one of the most harmful things to happen to folks who live outside in
  decades. It is not going to help anybody,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and
  communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center. “It sets the
  stage for rounding up folks who are homeless, folks with mental health issues,
  folks who are disabled – and instead of helping them, forcing them into
  detention camps and institutions. So it’s terrifying.” The order instructs
  states and municipalities to crack down on public substance use; camping,
  loitering, or squatting in urban spaces; mental health issues; and sex
  offender registration. It calls for “shifting” people without stable housing
  into “long-term institutional settings”. “It is essentially creating a pathway
  to criminalize larger and larger numbers of people,” said Margaret Sullivan, a
  family nurse practitioner and director of programs for immigrant and unhoused
  communities at the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard
  University. The order is “vague and broad and potentially leaning toward
  creating more civil rights violations”, she said. The conditions for
  detainment outlined in the order are poorly defined, which means it could be
  interpreted broadly to detain and involuntarily institutionalize people in
  public spaces. And it doesn’t detail who may make determinations on
  institutionalization. “It doesn’t define ‘mental health crisis’. It also
  doesn’t define who’s qualified to make an assessment,” said Rabinowitz.
  Individuals with mental illness are defined in the order as people who “pose
  risks to themselves or the public”, which could be broad enough to encompass
  many people, he said. And while the order sometimes refers to cracking down on
  “illicit” substance use, at other times it speaks more generally to substance
  use disorder – a condition that can include legal substances such as alcohol
  and prescription medication. Many states already have laws on involuntary
  commitment for mental illness, Sullivan said. Typically, the process begins
  with clinical healthcare providers or mental health professionals and goes
  through the judicial system. “There’s a judicial system to ensure that the
  rights of the individual are not being violated. To strip away those checks
  and balances, and make it so that there’s more essentially policing on the
  streets of mental illness … has never been proved to be effective in the long
  run,” Sullivan said. “This goes a step further than what we’ve seen in some
  other states or cities,” she added. The order would also expand drug courts
  and mental health courts, and it would “allow or require” anyone receiving
  federal funding for homelessness support to collect health information and
  share it with law enforcement. The Trump administration will also stop
  supporting housing-first policies, which provide housing and support services
  as quickly as possible to people experiencing homelessness, the order said. It
  comes amid significant proposed reductions for affordable housing. “The Trump
  administration is going to make housing more expensive. They’re going to force
  more people into homelessness. And then once people are homeless, they’re
  going to take away actual solutions, and instead lock people up for being
  homeless,” Rabinowitz said. This approach has serious repercussions for
  health, he added. “Housing is the best form of healthcare, period. The health
  impacts of housing are tremendous, and the health consequences of homelessness
  are devastating.” Higher rates of involuntary institutionalization would add
  greater strain to the healthcare system, Sullivan said. “We know that
  involuntary commitment leads to more people being in the emergency room and
  emergency rooms being more overwhelmed than they currently are.” Cuts to
  Medicaid will also make it harder for people with mental illness and substance
  use disorder to access healthcare, Sullivan said. And the new federal budget
  cuts funding for supportive services like mental health care and substance use
  treatment. The administration also plans to review grants for existing
  substance use programs, with explicit instructions not to fund projects on
  harm reduction – which often includes overdose response and naloxone
  distribution, needle and syringe exchanges, and education on safer drug use,
  among other initiatives – and safe consumption. And the order instructed Trump
  administration officials to pursue possible lawsuits against such programs.
  States and cities receiving federal funding could see that money restricted or
  frozen if they don’t enforce the new rules, the executive order said. In the
  wake of last year’s supreme court decision on Grant’s Pass, upholding the
  Oregon city’s ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness, several
  states and municipalities introduced stricter laws to target people living
  outside. “Especially when federal funding is really disappearing, this
  hamstrings cities and municipalities into compliance in order just to fund
  vital services,” Sullivan said. Focusing on programs addressing these issues
  in innovative ways “makes it seem like this is another mechanism for going
  after places like LA or Portland or Chicago or any place that is trying to do
  something different with addressing homelessness and substance use”, Sullivan
  said. “That is, to me, what it seems like – this is a way to go after not just
  individuals and people, but to go after areas,” she said. But it will have
  sweeping effects on homeless people and others to whom the order is applied.
  “I think that they are motivated by this incorrect belief that homelessness is
  a choice, that we have to punish people in order for them to make a better
  choice,” Rabinowitz said. Even if that were true, he said, “there are no
  carrots right now, there’s no housing that anybody can afford, but there are a
  whole ton of sticks, and we know that people don’t need a stick. People want
  housing; there’s just no housing that they can afford. But the executive order
  does nothing to address the actual causes of homelessness.” Sullivan agreed.
  “It does nothing to address underlying poverty. It does nothing to address the
  persistently unaffordable housing crisis,” she said. “It does nothing to
  expand access to Medicaid for impoverished people. Meanwhile, the numbers in
  the US of people who are experiencing chronic homelessness and disability are
  increasing.”
