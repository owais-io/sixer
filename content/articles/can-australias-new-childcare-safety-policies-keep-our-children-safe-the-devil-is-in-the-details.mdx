  Jason Clare celebrated the meeting as a win. Standing before the press, the
  federal education minister revealed he had hammered out a national agreement
  to improve safety in childcare services with his state and territory
  counterparts. “I think the work that we’ve done is going to make a real,
  meaningful difference,” he said. The meeting in many ways was the culmination
  of the government’s response to the childcare crisis. Clare, seemingly with
  the full support of his state counterparts, announced a number of measures to
  make childcare services safer. So, what are the policies the government has
  announced today, what difference will they make, and what questions still
  linger? What did the government announce today? We heard about a range of
  measures – the big two being the introduction of a national educator register,
  so authorities can know who has worked where and when, and a trial of CCTV in
  up to 300 centres nationally. Additionally, all early childhood care and
  education staff will undergo mandatory child safety training; personal mobile
  phones will be banned while working directly with children; the commonwealth
  will conduct an additional 1,600 spot checks per year; the federal government
  will invest $22m for joint compliance work with the states; and information
  about compliance breaches at centres will become publicly available for
  parents to see. What questions are unanswered? The devil is in the detail and
  unfortunately there were a lot of details missing. For instance, on the CCTV
  trial, Clare acknowledged the huge reservations a lot of people have about
  CCTV cameras in childcare centres. This, he said, is due to the threat that
  any information collected with CCTV could be hacked by paedophiles. “We’ve got
  to make sure that if this is rolling out in centres … that we get it right.”
  So, what would that look like? What sort of regulatory requirements would be
  imposed on centres to install secure systems and create concrete policies
  around data retention and protection? Well, that’s something we’ll find out in
  due course, said Clare. “We’ll commission an organisation to help us design
  the trial and to review it.” The trial will kick off in October or November
  and the results could be back by the third quarter of 2026. There are similar
  unanswered questions on the much-touted national register of educators. Would
  it contain just the names and employment histories of workers, or also include
  allegations against them, police investigations into them and other “red-flag”
  behaviour that might help centre directors decide if someone is fit to be
  employed, as has been recommended multiple times? Clare said the register
  would roll out in stages. Initially it will have the name of who is working in
  a centre and where they are, he said. “But over time, we want to build all of
  that information into it – so we can see employment history, so we can have
  the information that’s needed to identify red flags to tell us that someone’s
  moving quickly from centre to centre to centre, to be able to identify that
  somebody might be up to no good.” As for what would be included in “all of
  that information” that will be built into the register, and what the deadline
  is for “over time”, Clare wasn’t specific. What was missing from the
  announcements? Obviously a lot of things, which Clare acknowledged. He said
  the measures announced on Friday were not enough to solve the problem: “Is it
  everything that we need to do? No, of course it’s not, but it’s the next thing
  that we must do.” But there were a few big things that have been repeatedly
  brought up by reviews and reports into the childcare sector over many years
  that didn’t get a mention. One was introducing an independent early childhood
  education and care commissioner who would be able to provide national
  oversight to this issue and hold various governments to account. This has been
  recommended by many experts and in many reports, including a Productivity
  Commission review of the sector released last year and the Weatherill review
  into the Victorian sector, handed down this week. Another big thing was any
  talk of addressing the huge number of for-profit childcare providers and the
  way that the privatisation of childcare has, in the view of many experts,
  created a less safe sector. There was some expectation that this might be
  discussed after Lizzie Blandthorn, the Victorian minister for education, on
  Wednesday reflected on the growth of the for-profit sector: “This is not how
  you would set up a childcare system if you were to set one up from scratch”,
  adding that “education ministers were looking forward to having a good
  conversation about nationalising childcare across the country”. Asked about
  those comments today, Blandthorn was less direct, saying “what we do need to
  make sure that we do is have a national rethink and … we need to make sure
  that however a service is run, whoever owns it, that the best interests of the
  children are key.” The only mention of the privatisation of the sector by
  Clare was a fairly dismissive comment in his opening remarks. He said that
  “Australia expects all of us to work together ... the private sector, the
  for-profits, the not-for-profits, they don’t give a damn about the difference
  or the breakdown or who’s responsible for what. They just want their kids to
  be safe.” However, reports have found the for-profit sector, which now runs
  roughly 70% of centre-based childcares, performs worse than the not-for-profit
  sector on measures like pay for staff, staff turnover, staff vacancies – all
  things that experts say are crucial for creating a safe environment for
  children. Were there any surprises? There was one announcement that looks
  innocuous but could have an enormous impact over time, says Dr Caroline
  Croser-Barlow, CEO of The Front Project, an early childhood education think
  tank. At the top of a list of legislative reforms agreed by the ministers, was
  “making the safety, rights and best interests of children the paramount
  consideration under national law”. This might seem like bland lip service, but
  it could actually be a “real potential long-term sleeper of a change”,
  Croser-Barlow said. What it could mean is a shift in the way decisions are
  made – to factor in as paramount the best interests of the child. Such
  decisions could include centre directors about staffing, or whether to share
  information about a concerning former employee during a reference check, or
  even – in the case of for-profit providers – in the way they defend spending
  decisions and shareholder profits. “What it means is that, for example, when
  centre directors are making decisions about whether to stand down an employee,
  they’ll be thinking about not just about their industrial relations
  obligation, but what is in the best [interests] of the child.” Because it will
  become law, it could also give directors some form of legal defence or
  justification for their decisions, given we know that fear of defamation has
  been a factor in preventing educators reporting concerning behaviour to
  authorities. “That’s exactly the sort of thing it’s trying to get at,”
  Croser-Barlow said. “When you’re thinking about information sharing, or
  staffing … in the end you’ll be able to defend that the child’s interest are
  the primary thing.”
