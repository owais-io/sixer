  Anthony Albanese has insisted there’s “nothing secret” about a $400m deal with
  Nauru to offload hundreds of non-citizens to the tiny Pacific island as
  questions mount over the agreement’s fine print. The Albanese government
  quietly announced the news on Friday evening without attaching a dollar figure
  to the deal, nor providing details of the agreement between the nations. The
  prime minister said the arrangements to deport about 280 members of the NZYQ
  cohort, a group of non-citizens living in the Australian community whose visas
  were cancelled on character grounds, were “hardly secret” on Monday. However,
  Albanese refused to answer how and when the payments would be made to Nauru,
  and how long the agreement would last. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The
  arrangements we have put out, we’ll continue to engage, we want to deal with
  the NZYQ issue,” he told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. “These are people who do
  not have a legitimate reason to stay in Australia.” Human rights lawyers,
  refugee advocates and the Greens have all condemned the government’s
  “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous” deal while raising concerns about
  whether the deal contained assurances about the safety of the cohort. One
  federal Labor MP told Guardian Australia : “I feel a little uncomfortable with
  it, but I guess the government is really trying to take the politics away and
  get rid of a problem that’s been there for a long time,” they said on the
  condition of anonymity. The assistant immigration minister, Matt
  Thistlethwaite, told Sky News it was up to the Nauruan government whether the
  cohort could live freely or with restrictions. “I understand that possibly
  they can live in the community over there. It’ll be a matter for the Nauruan
  government,” he said. “But the funding that we’re providing is to help them
  settle people over there.” On Sunday, the Nauru government said the money
  would be placed in the nation’s sovereign wealth fund, the Nauru
  Intergenerational Trust Fund. The government announced the fund, established
  in 2015 by the now president, David Adeang, surpassed $420m in August prior to
  the deal’s announcement. “The capital fund will be distributed to the Nauru
  Trust Fund, to support Nauru’s long-term economic resilience and the
  operationalisation of the agreement contingent to the cohort size received,”
  Adeang said in a budget speech on Friday. The environment minister, Murray
  Watt, said on Sunday Nauru had agreed to a “substantial number of the cohort”
  that would be sent over gradually rather than in “one hit”. “The plan is to
  scale the number up and allow Nauru to put in place the systems that allow for
  the number to increase over time,” he said. The latest deal with Nauru
  followed an announcement by home affairs minister, Tony Burke, in February to
  take three members of the NZYQ cohort, including a convicted murderer. The
  three men have since lodged a series of appeals against their deportation,
  after they were found not to be refugees and not owed protection. They remain
  in Australia. In a February Senate estimates hearing, home affairs department
  officials said Nauru had discretion on where the men could live, and had
  indicated the site of former regional processing centres could be used. The
  officials said Australia’s “non-negotiables” in the original deal with Nauru
  related to the men’s freedom of movement and non-refoulement – where a person
  cannot be returned to a country where they face the threat of serious harm.
  The NZYQ cohort includes non-citizens released into the community in Australia
  as a result of a landmark 2023 high court decision. The court ruled in favour
  of “NZYQ”, a stateless Rohingya man, who faced the prospect of detention for
  life because no country had agreed to resettle him, due to a criminal
  conviction for raping a 10-year-old in Australia.
