  Parenthood Sunday, 7.20pm, BBC One A sleepy newborn gorilla resting on its
  mother’s chest might be the sweetest opening to a nature series ever, but give
  it 10 minutes and we’re soon watching lions rip open a buffalo. Welcome to
  David Attenborough’s wonderful new series about animal parenthood – witnessing
  the highs, the lows and the grisly (a mother needs to feed her kids!). The
  opener also takes us into the ocean to meet a gutsy “super mum” boxer crab
  about to hatch eggs while fighting off predators. And inside a tangled nest of
  webs, dying African social spiders are hunting food for thousands of
  spiderlings – but will they make the ultimate yummy mummy sacrifice?
  Fascinating stuff, if slightly skin-crawling. Hollie Richardson Lucy Letby:
  Beyond Reasonable Doubt? 10.20pm, ITV1 Neonatal nurse Lucy Letby was jailed
  for life in August 2023 after being found guilty of murdering babies in her
  care. But two years after her sentencing difficult questions are still being
  raised about the statistical and clinical evidence used to convict. The
  contested areas of an extraordinarily emotive case are examined in detail
  here. Graeme Virtue Karen Pirie 8pm, ITV1 In the final episode of the series,
  the discovery of a body in the caves of East Rotheswell sends DI Pirie’s
  (Lauren Lyle) cold case inquiry in several directions. Does Fergus Sinclair
  (John Michie) know more about the 1984 kidnapping than he’s previously
  admitted? And what will Mint (Chris Jenks) and Isla (Saskia Ashdown) find in
  Malta? Ellen E Jones Inside the Cult of the Jesus Army 9pm, BBC Two It’s the
  concluding part of an unsettling investigation into the Jesus Fellowship
  Church, which hears from former members who were abused there. But also, the
  big question is put to a former elder: why didn’t you report any of the abuse
  that you were told about? There is no satisfying answer. HR Celebrity SAS: Who
  Dares Wins 9pm, Channel 4 This celebrity hazing ritual is one of TV’s finest
  guilty pleasures. It returns with a promising lineup including former
  footballer Adebayo “The Beast” Akinfenwa, drag icon Bimini and dance
  professional Louis Spence. Billy Billingham and friends will be meeting them
  in the wilds of Wales – but how many will survive the brutal early stages?
  Phil Harrison The Narrow Road to the Deep North 9.20pm, BBC One The haunting
  adaptation of Richard Flanagan’s Booker prize-winning second world war epic
  continues. In a slower third episode, war hero and surgeon Dorrigo recalls
  intense feelings of guilt and failure not just about being unable to save the
  lives of fellow prisoners of war, but also concerning the affair he had with
  his uncle’s wife. HR Film choice The Room Next Door, 7.35am, 10.10pm, Sky
  Cinema Premiere Pedro Almodóvar’s latest divided the critics at last year’s
  Venice film festival – though not the jury, who awarded it the Golden Lion.
  Some felt his first English-language feature awkwardly transplanted his
  Hispanic melodrama to a Manhattan setting, in which terminally ill war
  photographer Martha (Tilda Swinton) reaches out to her old friend, bestselling
  author Ingrid (Juliette Moore). Others reckoned it was just as lush and
  seductive as ever, a third entry after Pain and Glory and Parallel Mothers in
  a death-preoccupied run of work. What can’t be disputed is how it rages
  against the dying of the light, both on a personal and planetary level, led by
  a cadaverous Swinton orchestrating her own exit. Phil Hoad Kensuke’s Kingdom,
  3.35pm, BBC One A stirring, classy adaptation, scripted by Frank
  Cottrell-Boyce, of the Michael Morpurgo novel about a shipwrecked child who
  encounters a Japanese war veteran on a remote island. Recalcitrant lad Michael
  (voiced by Aaron McGregor) is bugging his parents on their sailing trip – but
  once washed ashore with his dog, learns his place in the scheme of nature
  courtesy of the enigmatic Kensuke (Ken Watanabe). With its rich hand-drawn
  animation, it hews close to the purist likes of The Red Turtle – without an
  anthropomorphised talking animal in sight. PH The Killers, 9pm, Legend Xtra
  Dirty Harry director Don Siegel’s 1964 remake of the 1946 noir classic strips
  away the shadowy romanticism of the high noir era and streamlines it into a
  lean heist pic. It starts with headstone-faced hitman Charlie (Lee Marvin) set
  to assassinate former race-car champion Johnny North (John Cassavetes). Deemed
  too violent to be shown on TV as originally planned, its unvarnished mayhem
  and brisk direction looked ahead to the gritty urban crime epics of the coming
  decade. PH
