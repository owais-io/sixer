  The Premier League has reduced the length of its funding deal with Kick It Out
  from three years to 12 months, leading to concerns about the long‑term
  security of the charity’s income and the independence of the anti-racism
  movement. Kick It Out receives funding from a number of other stakeholders
  within the sport – including the Football Association, Professional
  Footballers’ Association and Sky Sports – but the Premier League is
  increasingly taking charge of its own initiatives and programmes around
  diversity and inclusion. It was revealed last week by the Daily Telegraph that
  the Premier League has ended an eight‑year partnership with Stonewall and will
  abandon the rainbow armbands and laces campaign. The top flight is planning to
  launch its own anti-homophobia initiative in February to coincide with LGBTQ+
  History Month. The Premier League has no plans to cut ties with Kick It Out, a
  pioneer in combating racism and championing diversity since forming in 1993 as
  a campaign group, Let’s Kick Racism Out of Football. Despite making
  considerable progress in driving racism out of stadiums, black players remain
  targets for abuse, as was demonstrated on Friday when the Bournemouth forward
  Antoine Semenyo was allegedly racially abused during the first Premier League
  game of the season at Anfield. Social media abuse is also rife, with the
  England defender Jess Carter revealing she received racist online messages
  during Euro 2025. That led to the Lionesses ending their pre-match gesture of
  taking the knee, after five years, for the semi-final and final of the
  tournament. The Premier League captains decided last week to continue taking
  the knee this season, but before only the two games during Black History Month
  in October. The Premier League declined to comment on its new funding
  arrangements with Kick It Out, but sources indicated a belief that a shorter
  deal will provide more flexibility to support specific programmes. The new
  funding deal is understood to have conditions attached regarding programme
  delivery, in line with the Premier League’s policy towards funding external
  groups. Kick It Out also declined to comment. The Premier League has
  significantly increased the staff numbers and resources committed to its own
  inclusion work in recent years. The former Huddersfield and Gillingham striker
  Iffy Onuora was appointed in 2021 as its first head of equality, diversity and
  inclusion, with Kuljit Randhawa joining as the head of diversity and inclusion
  strategy the following year. The Premier League has also set up a Black
  Participants’ Advisory Group, comprising former players and managers including
  Wes Morgan, Darren Moore and Chris Hughton, to provide additional advice.
  “We’re confident enough now to speak in our own voice,” the league’s chief
  executive, Richard Masters, said last week in reference to the Stonewall
  partnership. “We’re confident to put our own activations together, talking to
  clubs and stakeholders about it. Whatever activation we do is going to be in
  February and we look forward to making some announcements about it. “We
  decided to be more determined, in the same way we now speak in our own voice
  on issues of racism, with the No Room for Racism campaign. When you poll fans,
  they say that’s the second most important thing the Premier League does, other
  than organise the football competition. We believe promoting our campaigns
  now, ensuring they are going to work, is the way forward.” The league’s moves
  into this area have caused tensions with Kick It Out in the past, most notably
  when it launched the No Room for Racism campaign six years ago without
  informing the charity. To compound matters, the first No Room for Racism
  weekend, in March 2019, took place during fixtures reserved previously for
  Kick It Out events. While the league’s commitment to combating racism is not
  in doubt, industry experts have warned privately that an independent body such
  as Kick It Out should not be replaced, because the charity is better
  positioned to hold authorities and clubs to account.
