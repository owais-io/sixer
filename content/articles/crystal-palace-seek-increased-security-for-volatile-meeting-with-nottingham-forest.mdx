  Crystal Palace are in talks with Nottingham Forest, and the Metropolitan
  police, over the provision of increased security for the Premier League match
  between the teams at Selhurst Park on Sunday. Palace supporters are understood
  to be planning a protest at the fixture over Forest’s perceived role in
  getting them demoted to the Conference League, with Nuno Espírito Santo’s side
  replacing Palace in the Europa League after they were found by Uefa’s club
  financial control body to have broken multiclub ownership rules due to their
  former shareholder John Textor’s ownership of the French club Lyon, who also
  qualified for the latter competition. Forest wrote to Uefa with their
  observations about the alleged breach and sent their legal team to attend
  Palace’s appeal hearing at the court of arbitration for sport, which upheld
  the Uefa body’s decision last week. The Palace chair, Steve Parish, said in an
  interview with Gary Lineker’s Rest is Football podcast last month that Forest
  had played a key role in the decision to ban them. “We were told that and I
  think it’s been made public,” Parish said. “There doesn’t seem to be a lot of
  confidentiality that comes out of certain organisations. But we’re led to
  believe that’s the issue – if there wasn’t somebody that wanted to get in as a
  consequence, then there wouldn’t be a problem. People have got to look at
  themselves. Some people will say it’s fine, some people will say it’s not. I
  don’t really have control of that. I only have control of the arguments that
  we put forward to Uefa.” Palace fans have rallied behind Parish’s sense of
  injustice and are planning to make their feelings known on Sunday at the game,
  which would ordinarily be categorised by the Met as a low-risk fixture. While
  details of the protest have yet to be confirmed, there have been suggestions
  that protesters plan to arrive early at Selhurst Park and target the visitors’
  team coach, which may require additional protection from police and stewards.
  Hundreds of Palace supporters marched to Selhurst Park in protest after the
  initial decision to ban them from the Europa League last month, which the
  supporters’ group the Holmesdale Fanatics described as “a terrible injustice
  for both our club and the game of football as a whole”. More fans are likely
  to protest before what is Palace’s first home game of the season, particularly
  given the identity of their opponents. Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, is
  likely to be a target of abuse if the Greek billionaire decides to attend the
  game. Marinakis goes to most of Forest’s games in London and will be free to
  make his way to south London given his Greek club, Olympiakos, begin their
  season with a home game against Asteras Tripolis on Saturday evening.
  Marinakis will have his own security detail with him at Selhurst Park if he
  does attend, as is standard practice, while Forest’s safety and security team
  are involved in discussions with their counterparts at Palace to assess the
  level of risk. Despite the ill-feeling between the clubs, Palace have made it
  clear that Marinakis will be welcome in the boardroom. A Met spokesperson told
  the Guardian: “Officers will be in attendance at the upcoming Crystal
  Palace‑Nottingham Forest game. Our priority is keeping fans and the wider
  public safe, and we will continue to monitor the situation for developments.”
