  Jonas Vingegaard maintained his overall lead of the Vuelta a España yesterday,
  finishing third on stage three after a fraught 24 hours in which his
  Visma-Lease a Bike team discovered the theft of several bikes from an
  equipment truck. Vingegaard seemed largely unaffected, finishing on the wheels
  of second-placed Mads Pedersen and the stage winner, David Gaudu, after an
  uphill sprint at the end of the first medium-mountain stage of the race, a
  139km ride from San Maurizio Canavese to Ceres in Italy. Gaudu, who was third
  on Sunday, climbs to second place in the general classification after picking
  up 10 bonus seconds, while Pedersen’s teammate Giulio Ciccone finished fourth
  and is third overall. “I was thinking in the bus this morning it was more for
  Pedersen, but [teammate Stefan] Kung said to me I have a punch and I can win
  today,” Gaudu said after his first Vuelta stage win since 2020. “I’m very
  happy. I’m very, very proud to win for me, for the team. This is, I think, the
  best start to the Vuelta we could get.” Before the stage, Vingegaard’s Team
  Visma-Lease a Bike said police in Italy were investigating the theft of
  “several bikes” from an equipment truck. “Last night, our mechanics’ truck was
  broken into and several bikes were stolen,” the team said in a statement. “Our
  mechanics are working hard to ensure that the team is fully prepared for the
  third stage. The police have launched an investigation into the incident.”
  Vingegaard was also missing the support of Axel Zingle, after the French
  cyclist was in a crash on Sunday in the rain-hit stage that also caught up the
  team leader. Vingegaard went on to win with a bloodied elbow, but an injury
  from the crash has forced Zingle to abandon the race. Visma said: “Our medical
  team had to decide that Axel Zingle is not fit enough to continue the Vuelta.
  His first Grand Tour with the team comes to an early end.”
