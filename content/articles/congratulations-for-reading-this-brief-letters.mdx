  Never mind the wording of the accolade (Letters, 20 August), why do we need
  these constant accolades at all? In recent weeks, I have been congratulated
  for buying train tickets online, paying money into a savings account and
  taking part in an online consultation run by my professional body. No skill or
  luck on my part was involved in any of these operations. On the bright side,
  at least the Guardian has now reversed its top Wordwheel grading to a mere
  “Excellent”. Janet Fraser Twickenham, London • I was delighted to see an
  advert for U3A in the Guardian print edition (21 August). My wife and I signed
  up when we moved to Hampshire, joining lots of groups and making many friends.
  We have had exactly the same experience since moving back to Clitheroe. In our
  discussion group, the Guardian is an excellent source for interesting topics.
  Ian Duckworth Clitheroe, Lancashire • You report that “Russia’s foreign
  minister … said that Moscow must be included in any talks on Ukraine’s
  security guarantees” (20 August). Not sure how Ukraine and Europe can trust
  and allow the bank robber to be involved in bank security. Paresh Motla Thame,
  Oxfordshire • I suspect your quick crossword compiler (20 August) is too young
  to know that “phonograph material” was shellac, and vinyl was for record
  players. Michael Thorn Helston, Cornwall • When Keith Flett said “aged 68”,
  I’d thought he was referring to the age of his beard (Letters, 24 August).
  Richard Barnard Wivenhoe, Essex • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in
  the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
  publication in our letters section.
