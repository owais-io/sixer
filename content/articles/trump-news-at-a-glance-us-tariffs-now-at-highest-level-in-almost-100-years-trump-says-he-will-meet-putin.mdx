  Leaders all over the world were attempting to put contingencies in place after
  Trump’s tariff threats turned to reality at a minute past midnight Washington
  time on Thursday. The Brazilian government said it was planning a state aid
  plan for companies affected while its president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,
  called the duties “unacceptable blackmail”. Switzerland said it was seeking
  new talks with the US after a last-gasp mission to Washington by its
  president, Karin Keller-Sutter, failed to stop a 39% tariff blow that industry
  group Swissmem described as a “horror scenario”. Tariffs are now at a level
  not seen in the US in almost 100 years, with Americans expected to pay an
  average of 18.3% more for imported products – the highest rate since 1934 –
  according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.
  Despite the uncertainty, the White House is confident businesses will ramp up
  new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the US
  economy as a manufacturing power. Here are today’s key stories at a glance: 60
