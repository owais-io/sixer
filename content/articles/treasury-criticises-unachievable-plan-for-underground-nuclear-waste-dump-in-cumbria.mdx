  Treasury criticises ‘unachievable’ plan for underground nuclear waste dump in
  Cumbria

  The UK’s proposal for a new underground nuclear waste dump has been described
  as “unachievable” in a Treasury assessment of the project. Ministers have put
  new nuclear power at the centre of their green energy revolution. But the
  problem of what to do with 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste – roughly
  the volume of 6,000 doubledecker buses – from the country’s past nuclear
  programme, as well as future waste from nuclear expansion, has yet to be
  solved. The government is proposing the vast underground nuclear dump, known
  as a geological deposit facility (GDF), to safely deal with legacy waste and
  new nuclear material. No site has yet been confirmed for the dump and
  Lincolnshire county council recently pulled out of the process, leaving only
  two possible sites, both in Cumbria. A Treasury assessment this month,
  contained in the annual report of the National Infrastructure and Service
  Transformation Authority (Nista), has rated the project as “red”, which means
  successful delivery appears to be “unachievable”. A red rating states: “There
  are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or
  benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or
  resolvable. The project may need rescoping and/or its overall viability
  reassessed.” The report also suggests the cost could soar to up to £54bn.
  Richard Outram, the secretary of Nuclear Free Local Authorities, said: “The
  Nista red rating is hardly surprising. The GDF process is fraught with
  uncertainties and the GDF ‘solution’ remains unproven and costly. “A single
  facility as estimated by government sources could cost the taxpayer between
  £20bn and £54bn. This being a nuclear project, it is much more likely to be
  the latter and beyond.” Most nuclear waste is currently stored at Sellafield
  in Cumbria, which the Office for Nuclear Regulation says is one of the most
  complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. The power stations that need
  decommissioning include 11 Magnox power stations built between the 1950s and
  1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and
  Trawsfynydd in north Wales, as well as seven advanced gas-cooled reactors
  built in the 1990s, including Dungeness B, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2
  in Lancashire. Waste from more recent nuclear facilities, including Sizewell
  B, a pressurised water reactor in Suffolk, and two new EDF pressurised water
  reactors – Hinkley C, which is under construction in Somerset, and Sizewell C,
  which is planned for construction in Suffolk – will also need to be deposited
  in a GDF. It is likely to take until 2150 to deposit the legacy waste into a
  GDF, if one is built. Only then would a GDF be able to take waste from new
  nuclear reactors. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and
  Net Zero said: “Constructing the UK’s first geological disposal facility will
  provide an internationally recognised safe and permanent disposal of the most
  hazardous radioactive waste. “Progress continues to be made in areas taking
  part in the siting process for this multibillion-pound facility, which would
  bring thousands of skilled jobs and economic growth to the local area.”
