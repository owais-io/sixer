  snow by Grace Yee in this charming quarter, someone always loses a shoe (a
  sneaker, a croc, a gladiator sandal) on the last day of summer you waited for
  me by the green gates. I rode up on my bicycle (ticking spokes and
  trepidations) and you grinned from ear to ear – we are teeth we are cheese we
  are pets in the city! we stroll around the grounds weakly perpendicular
  without maps or navigations. you lie spreadeagled on the grass, my wings at
  your chest, the afternoon around us nonchalant. inside the windows are amber,
  blue and green, I don’t see horses grazing in the fields, I don’t hear cicadas
  mating. the corridor’s a hushed limousine, your door yields shelves of
  braille, and your room is a pink-striped eiderdown – premium economy, you said
  – I laughed and you pushed me and I shrieked and we fell onto the bed and the
  eiderdown kicked us off and shook its feathers all around us ‘snow’ began with
  a dream I had more than 20 years ago. In the dream there were green gates, a
  bicycle and a pink-striped eiderdown. At the time, my children were very young
  and my relationship was breaking down. The dream was a brief reprieve, a
  mellow not unpleasant yearning. The highlight of my week then was a two-hour
  poetry class. It was there that I workshopped the first draft of ‘snow’, with
  its thinly veiled needs and apprehensions: “friends”, a “red brick chapel”,
  “sticky feet” on “cold linoleum”. I read an early version of the poem at my
  first ever public reading, an open mic event. There were well-known poets
  there, most of them men. When I announced the title, one of them sniggered. I
  took this as a sign to keep the title. When I revisited ‘snow’ this year, I
  began with the old dream notes and a journal I kept on a trip last year to my
  parents’ ancestral villages in Guangdong, China. I was looking for
  in-the-world things to ground the original dreamscape. The “pets in the city”
  are the kittens for sale on a street corner near the Qingping Medicine Market
  in Guangzhou; “amber, blue and green” is from the stained glass “four seasons”
  windows that adorn early 20th-century houses in the countryside near Taishan;
  and “shelves of braille” is borrowed from the reading room for the visually
  impaired at the Baiyun Library. In terms of weight, ‘snow’ is much lighter
  than most of the poems I have written over the last few years. It is
  whimsical. I don’t usually do whimsy. The final stanza has remained the same
  since the first draft – except for the phrase “premium economy”. I like how
  this stanza begins with flight and ends with down. Australian Poetry Month
  runs throughout August and includes festivals, events, workshops and a
  commissioned poem of the day brought to you by Red Room Poetry. Find out more
