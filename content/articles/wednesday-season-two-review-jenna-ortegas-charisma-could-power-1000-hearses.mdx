  Hark! ’Tis the peal of baleful bells, for a new semester has befallen
  Nevermore Academy, and freshly minted celebrity Wednesday Addams (Jenna
  Ortega) is, naturally, having none of it. “I liked it better when I was feared
  and hated,” she monotones as a flock of awestruck fellow students scrabbles
  around her ankles, autograph books a-flap. Alas, her newfound fame is
  inescapable. “You’re kind of a big deal now after the whole saving the school
  from the demon pilgrim thing”, “It girl” Bianca (Joy Sunday) explains, as much
  to the viewer as to Wednesday, who is perhaps too busy administering icily
  efficient death-stares to her swooning fanbase to fully appreciate the
  ramifications of last season’s finale. The demon pilgrim thing? Ah, yes. The
  demon pilgrim thing. This, you may recall, was the climactic first-series
  kerfuffle surrounding one Joseph Crackstone, a bloodthirsty 17th-century
  pilgrim resurrected by dastardly botany teacher/beastmaster Marilyn Thornhill
  (Christina Ricci). Having already manipulated barista/actual monster Tyler
  Galpin (Hunter Doohan) into killing a series of pupils, police and local
  therapists, Thornhill planned on using the reanimated Crackstone to help her
  snuff out everyone else. Anyway, thanks to Wednesday the evildoers are now
  either exploded (Crackstone) or banged up (Thornhill and Galpin) and
  Nevermore, finally, is safe. Let joy – or at least guarded relief – be
  unconfined. And now? Peace descends and the second series of this most
  deliciously macabre of smash-hit murder-mystery/high-school comedy dramas – or
  at least the four episodes available prior to the second half of the series
  being launched in September – can proceed in orderly fashion. Or not, as the
  case may be, because – ruh-roh – here comes another baddie! Specifically, here
  comes the Kansas City Scalper, a serial-killing, doll-collecting professional
  dog groomer in a velour tracksuit played, with much oleaginous glee, by Haley
  Joel Osment (of The Sixth Sense fame). In a breakneck pre-title sequence, we
  learn that Wednesday has spent her summer vacation tracking down the Scalper,
  being tied up by the Scalper, turning the tables on the Scalper, relieving the
  Scalper of his scalp and, finally, delivering the Scalper to justice. The
  ultimate significance of all this is moot (certainly the incident is, at least
  in this first episode, not referred to again) although only a berk would bet
  against the scalpless sod popping up at a later date and putting everyone off
  their Weetos. It is, all in all, a very Wednesday introduction to the new
  season of Wednesday. That is; a hugely elaborate and wildly entertaining thing
  that happens very quickly and at great budgetary expense only to be promptly
  buried under the demands of a more immediately pressing plot strand. Which is,
  in this instance, Wednesday’s mystery stalker. Having emerged at the end of
  the last series, he/she/it has decided that our peerlessly nihilistic heroine
  must pay for something or other and has begun to leave her a series of
  increasingly shouty cryptic notes demanding she DO SOMETHING or other ABOUT
  THIS. Who is this irate foe? And what, precisely, is the nature of his/her/its
  beef? Further unusualness abounds. A local private investigator is pecked to
  death by a distinctly murderous murder of crows. Wednesday has horrifying
  visions of ditzy roommate Enid (Emma Myers)’s imminent demise. Nevermore,
  meanwhile, has an enthusiastic new principal in the Ned Flanders-y form of
  Barry Dort (Steve Buscemi, complete with statement knitwear and a moustache
  that follows you around the room). Dort is a Bruce Springsteen fan and is Not
  To Be Trusted. Also straddling the tantalising first-episode divide between
  “seems quite nice, actually” and “is almost certainly a shapeshifting
  necromancer” is wispy new music teacher Isadora Capri (Billie Piper, clearly
  having a blast). Similar fun is to be had in the return of Catherine
  Zeta-Jones’s woozy, pillowy Morticia Addams if not in Luis Guzmán’s lumpy,
  grinning Gomez, whose character, as ever, seems oddly unfinished, as if he’d
  abandoned rehearsals halfway through, having been distracted, perhaps, by a
  scotch egg. Minor quibbles aside, the season opener is wonderfully skittish
  and dense with jokes and plot. Tim Burton’s brisk direction ensures any
  embryonic wibbles of seriousness or sentimentality are swiftly squished by a
  shot of a rotting corpse, say, or a scene in which a flotilla of CGI
  caterpillars assemble themselves, apropos nothing, into the legend “BUG OFF”.
  In the middle of it all, meanwhile, is Ortega’s Wednesday, whose charisma
  could power a thousand hearses. Not that she’d appreciate our enthusiasm. “Do
  not put me on a pedestal,” she warns her besotted schoolmates during her guest
  of honour speech at the disastrous inaugural Nevermore gala. “The only place I
  will lead you is off a cliff.” The sensible among us are already preparing our
  parachutes. • Wednesday season two is on Netflix
