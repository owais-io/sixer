  Leading Democrats are sounding the alarm over Donald Trump’s reported plan to
  divert funds from the US nuclear arsenal to convert a luxury jet gifted by
  Qatar into a new Air Force One. The US president provoked an outcry in May
  when it emerged that he would accept a $400m Boeing 747-8 jet as a free gift
  from the Qatari royal family. Stripping down and securing the plane so it can
  transport Trump for a few years will cost taxpayers an estimated $1bn. Now
  Democrats are seizing on media reports that the retrofit will be partly funded
  by money redirected from Sentinel, a nuclear missile modernisation programme
  already running years behind schedule and said to be 81% over budget. In a
  letter obtained by the Guardian, senators Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth,
  Ed Markey and Adam Schiff, along with representatives John Garamendi and Jamie
  Raskin, demand answers from Troy Meink, the secretary of the air force. The
  letter reminds Meink that, in testimony to the Senate armed services
  committee, he acknowledged the Qatari plane needs “significant modifications”
  to meet Air Force One standards. These are likely to include defences against
  threats ranging from surface-to-air missiles to a nuclear blast, secure and
  reliable communications systems, and protections against counterintelligence.
  The Democrats write: “In June, you told Congress that the cost of retrofitting
  the Qatari Boeing 747-8 ‘wouldn’t be anywhere near’ the reported $1 billion
  estimate. Do you still believe this to be the case?” The air force has
  reportedly assessed $934m previously appropriated for the Sentinel programme
  as “excess to need”, allowing these funds to be used for other classified
  programmes, including the retrofits for the Qatari jet. In their letter, the
  Democrats ask Meink: “Has the Air Force assessed whether shifting funds out of
  the Sentinel program will increase the program’s costs or risk further
  delaying the program’s schedule? “Did or will any of the $934 million from the
  Sentinel program go to retrofits for the Qatari Boeing 747-8, or were or will
  those funds be diverted to other programs?” Warren and her colleagues
  criticise a lack of transparency, noting that the total price tag for the
  Qatari jet retrofit is classified, preventing policymakers and the public from
  understanding if “additional retrofit costs will eat into other Air Force
  programs beyond Sentinel”. The Democrats request a commitment from the air
  force to ensure that it is “fully cooperating with any independent
  investigation into the acceptance of the Qatari jet and/or the Qatari jet’s
  retrofitting”. Democrats have previously suggested that the gift to Trump
  likely violates the constitution’s prohibition on accepting foreign
  emoluments. They point out that the jet would only be used by the government
  for a few years at most before being donated to Trump’s presidential library.
  Trump has previously defended the ethics of his decision. He said: “I would
  never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I could be a stupid person
  and say: ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive airplane.’” He also
  compared it with “favours on the golf course. When they give you a putt, you
  pick it up and you walk to the next hole and you say: ‘Thank you very much.’”
  But the senators and representatives take a different view. “However,” they
  write, “by providing the president with a ‘palace in the sky’ it clearly
  appears that Qatar is trying to curry favor with the administration.”
  Meanwhile the Trump Organization recently announced a new Trump-branded resort
  along the coast of Qatar, partnering with Qatari Diar, a property company
  backed by that country’s sovereign wealth fund.
