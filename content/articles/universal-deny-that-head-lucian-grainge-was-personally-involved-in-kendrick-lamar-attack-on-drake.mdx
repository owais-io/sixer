  Lamar attack on Drake

  Universal Music Group has denied new allegations made by Drake’s lawyers that
  its British chair and chief executive Lucian Grainge had a “role in and
  knowledge of the scheme to defame and harass” the Canadian rapper by peer
  Kendrick Lamar, and that as such the label should “collect, review and
  produce” communications by Grainge. Drake is suing UMG – his label Republic’s
  parent company – over its release of Lamar’s 2024 diss track Not Like Us,
  which contains the line: “Say, Drake, I hear you like ’em young … Certified
  Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles.” The artwork for the global hit single
  features an image of Drake’s home dotted with icons used to identify the homes
  of registered sex offenders. Drake has denied the allegations, and in January
  filed a lawsuit against UMG – not Lamar himself – alleging that it “approved,
  published and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track”
  that was “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable and false factual
  allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public
  should resort to vigilante justice in response”. The label initially responded
  that the suit was “utterly without merit”. Drake’s latest motion argued that
  Drake believes “Grainge was personally involved in decisions made regarding
  the marketing and promotion of [Not Like Us] around its release”. Lawyers for
  UMG have now called for Drake’s motion to be denied, labelling it a
  “transparent attempt to use discovery to harass UMG and force it to waste time
  and resources out of spite” and that his “attempts to show Sir Lucian’s
  relevance are so strained that they defy credulity”. In legal documents,
  Grainge declared that he never heard the song prior to its release. Lawyer
  Rollin A Ransom continued: “The premise of Drake’s motion – that he could not
  have lost a rap battle unless it was the product of some imagined secret
  conspiracy going to the top of UMG’s corporate structure – is absurd. Sir
  Lucian is the CEO of a multinational enterprise; his days are spent
  determining and implementing global strategy, not vetting individual tracks or
  album covers or driving the release and promotional plans for any one
  recording.” Drake previously agreed not to seek documents from Grainge, the
  letter states. “And even if Sir Lucian had any responsive documents, they
  would surely be captured by discovery from UMG’s other document custodians,
  who were actually responsible for releasing and promoting Not Like Us. Drake
  does not come close to meeting his burden of showing that Sir Lucian must be a
  custodian.” The letter concludes: “Drake argues that Sir Lucian must be a
  custodian for no other reason than because Drake asked for him. That is
  entirely inconsistent with the law and is particularly inappropriate given
  that Drake’s request is clearly based on a desire to harass UMG, rather than
  for a legitimate reason.” Drake has not responded to the new filing. The
  Guardian has contacted his representatives. UMG is seeking to have the case
  dismissed entirely, claiming in March that Drake “lost a rap battle that he
  provoked and in which he willingly participated … diss tracks are a popular
  and celebrated art form centred around outrageous insults, and they would be
  severely chilled if Drake’s suit were permitted to proceed”.
