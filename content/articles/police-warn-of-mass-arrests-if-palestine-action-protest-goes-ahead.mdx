  The controversy over the ban on Palestine Action deepened on Monday, with
  police warning of mass detentions if a weekend protest goes ahead. The
  Metropolitan police made clear it would arrest anyone breaking terrorism laws,
  as Downing Street urged people not to attend any protest. In a further
  challenge to the decision to proscribe Palestine Action, 300 left-leaning
  Jewish figures including the director Mike Leigh and author Michael Rosen will
  tell the prime minister in a letter on Tuesday that the ban was “illegitimate
  and unethical”. Campaigners from the pressure group Defend Our Juries plan to
  descend upon Westminster in central London on Saturday carrying placards and
  posters expressing support for the group, where they are expected to be joined
  by 1,000 others. They are protesting against Yvette Cooper’s decision to ban
  the organisation last month after activists caused an estimated £7m of damage
  to jets at RAF Brize Norton. Defend Our Juries is asking those taking part to
  hold up signs saying “I Oppose Genocide, I Support Palestine Action”. More
  than 200 people have already been arrested in response to the proscription
  last month. A Met police spokesperson said the organisers of Saturday’s
  planned protest are attempting to put the overcrowded criminal justice system
  under further pressure. “We are aware that the organisers of Saturday’s
  planned protest are encouraging hundreds of people to turn out with the
  intention of placing a strain on the police and the wider criminal justice
  system,” they said. “The Met is very experienced in dealing with large-scale
  protests, including where the protest activity crosses into criminality
  requiring arrests. Our officers will continue to apply the law in relation to
  Palestine Action as we have done since its proscription. Anyone showing
  support for the group can expect to be arrested.” Starmer’s official
  spokesperson urged people not to attend. “Any action that is in support of a
  proscribed group in the UK, of course we do not support and the court has
  confirmed their continued proscription status,” they said. “The home secretary
  previously said that those who seek to support this group may yet not know the
  true nature of this organisation, but people should be under no illusion this
  is not a peaceful or non-violent protest group.” Sadiq Khan, who was vocal in
  urging Starmer to recognise a Palestinian state, declined to weigh in. A
  spokesperson for the mayor of London said: “The policing of Saturday’s planned
  protest by Defend Our Juries is an operational decision for the Metropolitan
  police.” On Tuesday, a delegation organised by Jewish Voice for Labour will
  deliver a letter signed by 300 Jewish figures to No 10 and Cooper urging a
  lifting of the ban on the group. Also signed by the human rights lawyer
  Geoffrey Bindman KC and the playwright Gillian Slovo, it will express “horror”
  at the actions of Israel. The letter will say: “We consider the proscription
  of Palestine Action to be illegitimate and unethical. It is time to end the
  government’s hand-wringing over the level of slaughter and suffering in Gaza
  and the West Bank, mixed with tacit support to the Israeli state. The Met is
  sceptical of claims that thousands of people could turn up on Saturday. The
  force believes that a total in the low hundreds is more likely. Anyone
  arrested risks a terrorism conviction. At other events that led to mass
  arrests, the Met has arrested people, confirmed their identities and home
  addresses, and then quickly released them on bail so they could be dealt with
  later. Police resources will be stretched at the weekend as a large, separate
  pro-Palestinian march is also scheduled for Saturday and anti-immigration
  protests are expected. A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries denied any plot to
  overwhelm the police and the court system, as reported in the Telegraph on
  Monday. The campaign was not organised by Palestine Action, the spokesperson
  said, adding that a briefing document was available openly on the Defend Our
  Juries website. “It’s great the Telegraph is helping us to spread the word but
  there are serious inaccuracies in their story. We are not the ones planning to
  ‘overwhelm’ the system,” they said. “If the Met exercises common sense and
  discretion and upholds its obligation to uphold the right of people to
  exercise their rights then nothing is being overwhelmed. “It is a difficult
  position for Sir Mark Rowley [the Metropolitan police commissioner] to be in.
  Based on what has happened on previous occasions it would be surprising if no
  one is arrested but on the other [hand] everyone is going to be doing the same
  thing and it will be a challenge to arrest more than 500 people given that we
  think there are about 520 available police cells in London at any one time.”
  They believed Rowley would be factoring in last week’s high court ruling
  giving permission to the co-founder of Palestine Action to bring a legal
  challenge to the home secretary’s decision to ban the group. Other forces
  exercised discretion not to arrest people at similar protests in Derry,
  Edinburgh and elsewhere, they added. The protests would take place regularly
  in future, they said, adding that it was becoming “a badge of honour” to be
  arrested. Defend Our Juries has held discussions with MPs about taking part
  but there was a reluctance on the basis of concerns it could lead to
  suspension from parliament. About 40 pro-Palestine protesters gathered outside
  the Labour party headquarters on Monday evening. Campaigners held Palestine
  flags and chanted “Shame on Keir Starmer, shame on the Labour party, shame on
  David Lammy” while banging steel pot lids outside the office in Southwark,
  London. One sign displayed by the group read “We support the legal application
  to de-proscribe Palestine Action. Fight racism. Fight imperialism.” A Ministry
  of Justice spokesperson said: “The criminal justice system will always be
  ready to deal with sudden surges coming through the courts.” The Home Office
  did not respond to questions about the planned protest.
