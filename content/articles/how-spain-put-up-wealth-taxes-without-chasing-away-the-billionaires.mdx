  With its green curtain of hanging gardens, the Planeta building is one of
  Barcelona’s most recognisable office blocks. Earlier this summer, it was
  acquired as part of a Monopoly board spending spree by Spain’s richest man,
  the Zara fashion label founder Amancio Ortega. Through his Pontegadea family
  office, which invests his personal wealth, Ortega has also just snapped up the
  five-star Hotel Banke in Paris, an apartment building in Florida, and a
  half-share in the operator of Teesport in the north-east of England, adding to
  a property portfolio already worth €20bn. Why the rush? Ortega is poised to
  receive a record dividend of €3.1bn (£2.7bn) this year from his shares in
  Zara’s parent group, Inditex. He is reportedly racing to spend the windfall,
  which would otherwise be subject to wealth taxes. Sources close to Pontegadea
  told the Guardian it was not investing to avoid tax, but following its mandate
  “to create wealth from the original assets, maintain it, make it grow, and
  consolidate it over generations”. It invests all dividends from Inditex “and
  any other income from its own economic activities every year, no matter the
  amount”, they said. Whatever the reason, the Ortega property portfolio has
  grown rapidly in recent years, making his family office one of Europe’s
  biggest real estate owners. As chancellors around Europe cast about for ways
  to repair the damage to public finances caused by successive global shocks,
  there is a growing clamour for more effective ways to tax the largest private
  fortunes. Spain is one of only three European countries (along with
  Switzerland and Norway) to still collect wealth taxes, and policymakers are
  looking to Madrid for lessons in what works – and what doesn’t. In the UK, the
  former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and the party’s former shadow chancellor
  Anneliese Dodds have joined those calling for Rachel Reeves to introduce a
  wealth tax when she sets out her budget in the autumn. As the chancellor looks
  at the options, which could also include changes to inheritance tax, members
  of her own party are pushing for a debate in parliament about introducing a 2%
  annual levy on those with assets over £10m, which they say could raise £24bn.
  In France, a similar proposal aimed squarely at the ultra-rich with assets of
  more than €100m was approved by the lower house but was rejected by the
  senate. Wealth taxes are designed to take a percentage of a person’s assets
  each year. Once fairly common, they have gradually fallen out of use, replaced
  by levies that bite when money changes hands, for example, through dividend
  payments, inheritance and sales of shares or property. Solidarity tax arrives
  Spain’s wealth tax dates to 1978, a year that marked the transition to
  democracy from dictatorship under Franco. Regional governments receive the
  revenues collected by the levy, a system that worked well until, after a brief
  pause during the financial crisis, it was brought back in 2011. On its return,
  Madrid’s conservative administration responded by discounting the rate to
  zero. The move benefited the high-earning footballers at Real Madrid,
  attracted new residents from other regions, and incomers from Venezuela and
  other Latin American countries, boosting property prices. In 2022, the
  conservative-run region of Andalucía in the south, announced that it, too,
  would cut the rate to zero. In a play on the Spanish term for tax haven,
  paraíso fiscal, Madrid’s regional leader posted on X: “Andalucíans: welcome to
  paradise.” Then Galicia, in the north-west, where Ortega is resident for
  wealth tax, joined the fray by offering a 50% discount. A source of income
  that had been providing hundreds of millions of euros a year to support local
  services, including healthcare, was under threat. The battle to save it became
  a tussle between the socialist-led central government, headed by Pedro
  Sánchez, and conservative-run autonomous regional governments. At the end of
  December 2022, Sánchez took action, with the solidarity tax on large fortunes.
  Initially for two years, to help with public spending after the pandemic, it
  has now been rolled over until the regional financing is revised, which is not
  likely to happen soon. It was designed in such a way that whatever revenue was
  forfeited by the regions would be collected centrally. The rate starts at 1.7%
  for those with net wealth of €3m, rising to 3.5% for fortunes over €10m. It is
  payable on worldwide assets. There are allowances: the first €700,000 is
  exempted, as is €300,000 for the main residence. A cap to help the asset rich
  and cash poor means that combined income and wealth taxes cannot exceed 60% of
  income. Numbers shared with the Guardian by the Ministerio de Hacienda (the
  Spanish Treasury) show that in the first year, 2023, the regions collected
  €1.25bn, and the central government €630m; a total of €1.88bn. In 2024, the
  regions took the logical step of keeping the income for themselves. The total
  take rose to €2bn. “The solidarity tax is not a tool to collect revenues for
  central government, it is a way of forcing regions to collect more,” says Dirk
  Foremny, associate professor of economics at the University of Barcelona. In
  that respect, it has worked perfectly. As a revenue raiser, it is limited. The
  approach from Madrid has been light touch, though the rules could be changed
  to raise more. The sums collected are on a par with inheritance tax – already
  heavily discounted by the regions – which raises about €3bn a year. By
  contrast, income taxes bring in €130bn. But Foremny says the solidarity tax
  has a social value. “This tax is a tool to achieve a more equitable
  distribution of wealth across individuals. There are good arguments why we
  don’t want to have a very large concentration of wealth in the hands of very
  few. Wealth is correlated with political influence and power.” He points to
  the US and its billionaire tech barons as a warning of what can happen when
  the scales tip too far. What is clear is that, two years on, a predicted
  exodus of the rich, trumpeted in endless alarmist headlines, has not
  materialised. Forbes counted 26 Spanish billionaires in 2021. This year, it
  lists 34, with a combined net worth comfortably over $200bn. “The big fortunes
  mostly stayed put, filed protective appeals, and hired better structuring
  teams,” says Marc Debois, the founder of FO-Next, which advises family
  offices. “A handful decamped to Lisbon or Dubai or any other location; enough
  for newspaper headlines, not enough for a flight.” Family exemption targeted
  Could the billionaires be made to pay more? Experts point to a big exemption:
  the one for “family companies”. Originally designed to encourage small- to
  medium-sized businesses, these structures are also being used by the very
  biggest fortunes to manage their assets. There are restrictions. A taxpayer
  must demonstrate that assets are being used for economic activity, that is, a
  trade or business. Cash and shares held simply for investment purposes are
  taxable. Real estate that earns rents is not. If the family exemption is
  abolished, Debois says the billionaires won’t necessarily decamp. They are
  more likely to lawyer up, reduce profits by leveraging (taking on debt), and
  create holding companies in low-tax jurisdictions such as Luxembourg. “Some
  money already half‑abroad would finish the move,” he says. “The bigger issue
  is tens of thousands of mid‑sized family firms rely on the same rule; torching
  it is politically radioactive.” Estimates by Julio López Laborda, a professor
  of public economics at the University of Zaragoza, suggest that 80% of the
  assets of the richest 1% are not subject to the wealth tax. He says the family
  company exemption could represent a loss to the Treasury of about €2bn, while
  the cap on tax as a proportion of income, mentioned above, could account for
  another €2.5bn uncollected. Susana Ruiz, tax justice policy lead at Oxfam,
  which is working with López Laborda on a forthcoming report about wealth
  taxes, says: “We could be raising at least two to three times more than we are
  at the moment.” Cutting public services in order to fund tax breaks, or simply
  balance the books, can create a doom loop, because it reduces the quality of
  provision, undermining the consensus on which taxation depends. In Madrid,
  declines in healthcare provision fuelled resentment among working people and
  created a sense that private provision was more efficient, says Ruiz. She
  believes the solidarity tax has helped rebuild confidence. “There is a lot of
  citizen support behind it. It helps in the perception that the system is
  fair.” So far, there is no sign that it has affected growth. Spain was the
  world’s fastest-expanding major advanced economy last year, outpacing even the
  US, with GDP up 3.2%. By contrast, growth in the UK and France last year
  barely scraped above 1%. On the balconies of the Planeta building, and in the
  country at large, the green shoots are alive and well.
