  The premier of New South Wales, Chris Minns, has said he is open to a
  parliamentary inquiry into Ivan Milat, after a state MP questioned whether the
  backpacker murderer could be responsible for many more deaths. Legalise
  Cannabis party MLC Jeremy Buckingham is pursuing whether Milat was responsible
  for dozens of unsolved murders throughout Australia, mainly of young women. In
  an estimates committee hearing in NSW parliament, Buckingham presented the
  premier with two images: a photo of a young Milat alongside a police sketch of
  the suspect in the Wanda beach murders, which occurred in 1965 in southern
  Sydney. Minns agreed there was a likeness. “Yes, I am concerned they are
  incredibly similar,” he said. Minns said he would first seek to meet the
  families of victims “to understand … their circumstances and their anguish
  associated with the loss of their loved one”. But he said he would not rule an
  inquiry out, saying that such a move “may be the necessary next step, given
  the scale of some of the things”. The Wanda beach murders were the unsolved
  killings of two 15-year-old girls, Marianne Schmidt and Christine Sharrock,
  who were found dead in the sand dunes near Cronulla in Sydney on 12 January
  1965, decades before the backpacker murders took place. Milat was convicted in
  1996 of the murders of seven backpackers whose bodies were found in the
  Belanglo State Forest, in the NSW southern highlands. He was sentenced to life
  in prison and died in jail in 2019. Melbourne couple Deborah Everist and James
  Gibson, German travellers Simone Schmidl, Anja Habschied and Gabor Neugebauer,
  and Britons Joanne Walters and Caroline Clarke were all killed between 1989
  and 1992 after Milat picked them up hitchhiking. The Belanglo murders were
  among the inspirations for the 2005 horror film Wolf Creek, about a gun-loving
  outback murderer who terrorises three backpackers. Buckingham has been seeking
  police files on investigations into Milat using parliamentary processes to
  demand documents, believing there are dozens of unsolved murders that Milat
  may have committed. On Wednesday, Buckingham was blocked from receiving the
  files because the government said there are still ongoing criminal
  investigations. However Minns said he would consider Buckingham’s request to
  release Milat’s employment records with government agencies including the
  Department of Main Roads. As a road worker, Milat moved around NSW. He also
  fled to Queensland and Victoria, before flying to New Zealand. Police maintain
  that Milat could have been involved in more murders than the seven for which
  he was convicted, with police questioning him over a number of other cases
  until his death. Investigations into the unsolved deaths and disappearances of
  young people were started in 1993 by Task Force Air by comparing Milat’s known
  criminal and victim profile, and his known modus operandi, to cold cases. The
  victim list ran to 56 people, including many hitchhikers who disappeared.
