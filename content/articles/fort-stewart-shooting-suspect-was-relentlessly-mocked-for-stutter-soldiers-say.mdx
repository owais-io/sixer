  A friend of the man accused of gunning down five fellow soldiers at the Fort
  Stewart army base in Georgia earlier this week recounted how the suspect had
  been repeatedly bullied for having a serious stutter, according to a news
  report. Meanwhile, soldiers who acted swiftly to suppress the gunman and
  prevent the possibility of a much higher death toll were being hailed as
  heroes for their bravery in the terrifying moments after shots rang out on the
  sprawling military base on Wednesday morning. The man in custody for the
  shooting, Sgt Quornelius Radford, 28, was relentlessly mocked and mimicked for
  his speech impediment, from the earliest days of his army career, NBC News
  reported on Thursday. “He got bullied a lot. It was very bad to the point
  where he could barely talk,” Sgt Cameron Barrett, 28, a friend of Radford’s,
  said in an interview with the TV network. No motive has been officially
  discussed in the aftermath of the incident, amid the criminal investigation,
  in which five service members were wounded by gunfire and rushed to the
  hospital, although they are expected to recover. Another soldier who had
  worked alongside Radford earlier in his career said that the sergeant had also
  lost a loved one in a traffic accident in January, and had taken it hard. The
  suspect’s father has said his son complained of experiencing racism. When
  initial reports that there was a shooting began to reach soldiers on the base
  south-west of Savannah, Barrett said to NBC that he messaged Radford to ask if
  he was all right, but did not get a response. Meanwhile, Sgt Aaron Turner
  recounted to the Associated Press that he was helping lock down a supply
  warehouse at Fort Stewart when he saw a fellow soldier walking past, wearing a
  hooded sweatshirt over his uniform and holding a handgun – after shots had
  already been fired. Instead of ducking for cover, Turner said, he approached
  the gunman and started talking – asking what he was doing there and where he
  was heading. When he got close enough, Turner grabbed the soldier’s gun and
  took him to the ground, where soldiers held him down until military police
  arrived. “I was able to keep a cool head, but pretty much my training ended up
  kicking in,” Turner said on Thursday. “It wasn’t about my life at that point.
  It was about the soldiers.” The US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, came to Fort
  Stewart on Thursday to praise Turner and five other soldiers for their quick
  actions in subduing the gunman to prevent further bloodshed and rendering
  life-saving aid to the victims. Driscoll awarded each of them the meritorious
  service medal. “The fast action of these soldiers under stress and under
  trauma and under fire absolutely saved lives from being lost,” Driscoll said
  at a news conference afterward. Authorities say Radford used a personal
  handgun in the shootings, not a service weapon. Fort Stewart officials have
  not said why he opened fire, citing the criminal investigation. Radford worked
  as a supply sergeant assigned to the 703rd brigade support battalion of the
  third infantry’s 2nd armored brigade at Fort Stewart, the largest US army post
  east of the Mississippi River, and home to thousands of soldiers. The
  battalion’s commander, Lt Col Mike Sanford, said on Thursday that he’s unaware
  of any problems with Radford or arguments that preceded the shootings. “Right
  now, there’s no signs that there was an issue,” Sanford said in an interview.
  Radford’s father, Eddie Radford of Jacksonville, Florida, said in an interview
  with the New York Times that his son had sought a transfer and complained to
  his family about racism at the base. Radford, who is Black, texted an aunt
  shortly before the shooting and “said that he loved everybody, and that he’ll
  be in a better place because he was about to go and do something”, Eddie
  Radford said. Sgt Carlos Coleman, who worked with Radford early on after the
  latter joined the army in 2018, also spoke to NBC about the man’s stutter. “It
  was easy for those people to make fun of him for the way he spoke. After that,
  he really didn’t speak that much,” he said.
