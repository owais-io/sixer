  Thomas Partey was greeted with some whistles, a little applause and no major
  protest as he made his competitive debut for Villarreal on Friday. The
  32-year-old former Arsenal midfielder has been released on bail in England,
  charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault, which he
  denies. His signing had drawn complaints from supporters in Spain but on his
  first La Liga appearance at the Estadio de la Cerámica there was mostly
  indifference. Partey was introduced in the 82nd minute, along Alfonso Pedraza,
  with Santi Comesaña and Nicolas Pépé making way. As the two players entered
  the pitch, with Villarreal 2-0 up against Real Oviedo and the game drifting to
  a conclusion, some whistles could be heard among the clapping. Partey touched
  the ball 13 times and the first four or five of those were met more clearly
  with whistles, although they soon faded. They did not come from a particularly
  significant portion of the crowd. There was also some timid applause in
  response to the whistles. There were no banners, no chants, no renewed social
  media campaign and neither manager was asked to comment on Partey after the
  game. The whistles were not sufficient to be registered by everyone. Cadena
  Ser radio’s local correspondent, who sat high in the main stand, reported that
  he had not heard any. “The Cerámica is going to treat Thomas Partey as just
  another player, at least for the moment,” said the sports newspaper AS. “The
  majority of the Villarreal fans accept the presumption of his innocence.”
  Partey appeared in court in early August, where he was granted conditional
  bail and charged with five counts of rape of two women and another count of
  sexual assault against a third woman. The offences were alleged to have taken
  place during 2021 and 2022 when he was at Arsenal, although he had initially
  not been named for legal reasons. Partey’s lawyer has said that he “denies all
  the charges against him” and welcomes “the opportunity to finally clear his
  name”. He joined Villarreal two days later. If he is found guilty, his
  contract will be automatically rescinded. “His is in the midst of a legal
  process. He defends his innocence and denies the accusations,” said the
  Villarreal president, Fernando Roig. “The club defends the presumption of
  innocence and it is for the English justice system to clarify the facts.
  Logically, we are opposed to any type of violence in or outside of football.
  “At the moment, Partey is as innocent as everyone else here. That fundamental
  right must be respected. He is a great player and he will help us grow as a
  team. If he is [found] guilty he will no longer be part of Villarreal but he
  is not [yet]. We have to wait.” Some Villarreal fans opposed the move. José
  Ángel Arnau, a spokesperson for the federation of Villarreal supporters’
  clubs, described the signing as divisive. “Villarreal have got themselves into
  an unnecessary mess,” he told El País. “I am against this signing. This goes
  against everything they have always said, the image of a quiet, family club.
  Now it seems like anything goes.” An online petition opposing his signing has
  just over 1,000 signatures. However, the president of the federation of
  supporters’ clubs, Javier Pérez, said: “If the club have backed him, so should
  we. He is one of ours and we will support him like any other player.” When
  Villarreal played Aston Villa in a pre-season friendly at the Cerámica last
  Sunday, Partey was whistled. “It was the English that whistled him, not the
  Villarreal fans,” Roig said. “I wouldn’t like our own fans to whistle players
  in our team. You have to be with the team and respect the presumption of
  innocence. Let us not judge ahead of time. Thomas has the right to do his job
  until there is a verdict. I wouldn’t like it at all if our own people were
  whistled.” On Friday night, this was a view that appeared to be shared by
  most, although not all, supporters.
