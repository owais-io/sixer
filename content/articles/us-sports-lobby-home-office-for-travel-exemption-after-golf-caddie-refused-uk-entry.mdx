  Sports organisations in the US will press the Home Office to apply exemptions
  to new travel rules for American citizens entering the UK, after Harris
  English’s caddie missed out on around £130,000 by being denied access for the
  Scottish Open and the Open Championship. The case of Eric Larson has alerted
  sport governing bodies such as the NFL and NBA, which stage games in London,
  that sportspeople or staff can be prohibited from entering the UK under
  electronic travel authorisation (ETA) rules if they have a criminal
  conviction. Larson was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1995 for involvement
  in drug dealing and rebuilt his career as a caddie for several leading PGA
  Tour players after serving 10 years. Larson’s past had been largely forgotten
  until the Scottish Open, when it was revealed that any American citizen given
  a custodial sentence of at least 12 months will now be denied UK entry. ETA
  implementation started in January this year. Larson was refused travel despite
  lobbying to the Home Office from the PGA Tour and the R&amp;A. English tied
  22nd in Scotland and finished second in the Open. Caddies typically receive
  around 10% of their player’s winnings; English earned more than £1.8m from his
  UK trip. As things stand, Larson will encounter the same situation in 2026.
  The American bodies will point to the fact that Donald Trump’s ban on citizens
  from a dozen countries entering the US – another seven have been served with
  restrictions – contains an exemption intended to apply to players, staff or
  associated families linked to the 2026 Fifa World Cup or the 2028 Los Angeles
  Olympic Games. No such leeway exists presently for the UK border. “Sporting
  bodies are now asking the UK to apply sporting exemptions on this system,” a
  senior figure within US sport said. The Home Office did not offer comment on
  whether it has already been asked to apply sporting exemptions on the ETA and
  what any response towards this might be. A source with knowledge of the Home
  Office position said: “Each application for a decision outside the rules is
  considered on its merits but informed by previous examples and precedents.”
  The same source confirmed the “mandatory and automatic refusal of entry
  clearance for individuals who have received a previous custodial sentence of
  at least 12 months”. The NFL will return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for
  matches on back-to-back weekends in October. The NBA announced last week that
  games will be staged in London in early 2026 and Manchester the following
  year. An obvious anomaly with the UK’s present stance can be demonstrated
  within golf. Ángel Cabrera received a multiyear prison term for crimes against
  women. The former Masters champion, from Argentina, played in the Senior Open
  at Sunningdale in July. The Australian Ryan Peake participated in the Open at
  Royal Portrush, six years after being released from jail on a serious assault
  conviction. Peake is understood to hold a UK passport.
