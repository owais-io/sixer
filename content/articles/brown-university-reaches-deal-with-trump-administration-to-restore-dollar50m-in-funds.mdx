  Brown University has reached an agreement with the Trump administration that
  will reinstate nearly $50m in research funding and close several federal
  investigations into the institution, university president Christina Paxson
  announced in a campus-wide email on Wednesday. The settlement follows the
  Trump administration’s threat in April to freeze $510m in federal support to
  Brown. This makes Brown the third Ivy League school to reach a resolution with
  the federal government this month. Under the terms of the agreement, Brown
  will commit to nondiscrimination in both admissions and campus programs, and
  will grant federal officials access to its admissions data. The arrangement
  brings to an end investigations led by the Departments of Health and Human
  Services, Education and Justice. A statement from the institution said that
  the “voluntary agreement will reinstate payments for active research grants
  and restore Brown’s ability to compete for new federal grants and contracts,
  while also meeting the core imperative of preserving the ability for our
  students and scholars – both domestic and international – to teach and learn
  without government intrusion”. The agreement between Brown and Trump does not
  require the university to admit any wrongdoing. And unlike Columbia
  University, which agreed to pay a $200m settlement, Brown’s deal does not
  involve any financial penalty. The email stated that “the government does not
  have the authority to dictate teaching, learning and academic speech”. The
  education secretary, Linda McMahon, had previously described the Columbia
  settlement as a “roadmap”, predicting it would “ripple across the higher
  education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come”.
  In addition to a pledge to “reaffirm compliance with nondiscrimination laws”
  in admissions and programs, the deal also prevents Brown from administering
  gender-affirming surgeries to minors or prescribing puberty blockers. The
  university has also agreed to implement the Trump administration’s definitions
  of male and female (as outlined in a January executive order) for women’s
  athletics, student programs, campus facilities and housing.
