  The weeverfish is like a ninja – one minute it’s there, the next it’s gone,
  and you are left in excruciating, throbbing pain. Weeverfish are common in the
  Atlantic Ocean in summer, and I got stung in the waters off Cornwall where I
  live. Let me take you back to the start … I love to be outside surfing,
  swimming in the sea, walking or cycling. Saturday had swung around and I was
  excited for my surf lesson. The sun was shining and the sea was a brilliant
  cerulean blue, but much colder than it looked. Me and my friends grabbed the
  boards, threw the leashes around our ankles and bounded into the sea. The cool
  spray snatched my breath away as I ducked under a wave. The next quarter of an
  hour passed quickly – full of laughter and wipeouts, the constant paddling,
  the scrabbling to the surface … I barely noticed my foot touch the seabed
  where they lurk – a bad mistake. I instantly felt an agonising sting in my
  toe, a crescendo of pain sweeping through my foot. I cried out in surprise.
  Was it as bad as I had read? Yes! The next two days I had lots of allergic
  reactions as the venom from its spine worked its way through me. Swelling,
  itching, and I had puffy cheeks, red as a tomato. But this is no reason to be
  scared of weeverfish. This was only a reminder of how much more powerful
  nature is than us humans. This is why we should look after it, and protect it
  for future surfers (and everyone else!) to enjoy. Thelo, 10 • Read today’s
  other YCD, by Jamie, 14: ‘The summer smell of ‘black gold’ in our compost
  heap’ • The Young Country Diary submission form is now closed for the summer,
  but keep the link handy, it will reopen on 1 October for autumn articles
