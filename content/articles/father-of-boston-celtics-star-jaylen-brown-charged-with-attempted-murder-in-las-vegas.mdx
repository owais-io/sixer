  The father of Boston Celtics All-Star Jaylen Brown is facing an attempted
  murder charge in Las Vegas after police say he stabbed another man during a
  parking lot confrontation. According to authorities, officers were called to
  the 1500 block of South Buffalo Drive at 5.42pm Tuesday, where they found a
  man suffering from multiple stab wounds. The victim was taken to a local
  hospital and remained in critical condition. In a statement, a Las Vegas
  metropolitan police department spokesperson said the suspect, 57-year-old
  Quenton Marcelles Brown, was stopped a short distance from the scene and taken
  into custody. He was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on a charge
  of attempted murder. TMZ first reported that the altercation began when Brown
  allegedly dinged the victim’s car door with his Lincoln Navigator. A heated
  argument followed, during which Brown allegedly stabbed the man in the back
  and stomach. Court records reviewed Wednesday listed Brown as an inmate at the
  Clark County facility. A person with knowledge of the case, who spoke on
  condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it,
  confirmed that the man arrested is Jaylen Brown’s father. Before becoming
  known as the parent of one of the NBA’s brightest stars, Marselles Brown
  carved out a lengthy career as a professional boxer. Listed at 7ft tall with
  an 86in reach, he fought professionally from 1989 through 2008, then again
  from 2014 through 2016 following a six-year retirement, compiling a 33-18-1
  record with 25 knockouts. He also served on the board of the Hawaii state
  boxing commission. He was a formative influence on Jaylen’s independence as a
  young athlete, encouraging him to enter the 2016 NBA draft without an agent so
  he could negotiate his own first contract. “My main motivation for coming out
  of retirement was to show my kids that I never gave up on my dreams,” he said
  in a 2016 interview, adding that he wanted them to take the same approach. The
  Celtics declined to comment on Wednesday.
