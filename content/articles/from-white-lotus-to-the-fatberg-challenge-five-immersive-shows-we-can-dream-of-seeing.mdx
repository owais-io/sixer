  This is the summer of the live immersive experience – Elvis, Grease, Traitors
  Live – but the biggest shows are expensive and tickets are already selling
  out. Never fear: there are plenty of other experiences out there for anyone
  looking to get immersed on a budget, or to try something a bit different. But
  what? We had a look at a few we could imagine happily queueing for. Book now,
  while places remain. White Lotus Live This former grain storage and processing
  facility, a short coach ride from central Birmingham, has been transformed
  into a luxury resort for the month of August, where you won’t just see how the
  other half lives – you’ll live how the other half lives, until one of you dies
  horribly (see our T&amp;Cs). Experience the spiritual hollowness at the core
  of extreme privilege first-hand, while sipping luxury cocktails on the sands
  of our artificial beach (if you choose to swim, please be aware that the
  lifeguards are actors), while events around you move inexorably towards
  tragedy. Nightly shows begin at 7.30pm, but the bar opens at midday. Once
  Removed: Tribute Band Summer Festival Experience The closest thing to watching
  your favourite band being impersonated live: a big-screen surround-sound
  festival evening featuring AI renderings of up to a dozen of Britain’s finest
  rock and pop tribute acts, including Phoney M, Not the Hoople, Re:Prince, Sham
  Sham 69 and Proxy Music. The only difference between this show and the real
  thing (not the real thing; see our FAQs) is the ticket prices, which start at
  a fiver for cash (dynamic pricing applies). Mickey 17: the Live Musical The
  live rights to this big-budget Robert Pattinson vehicle were acquired long
  before the film proved to be the box office flop of 2025. That’s why there is
  still availability throughout August, at prices to beat any outdoor immersive
  experience. State-of-the-art projection technology will make you think you’re
  part of the crazy world of Mickey 17. Or it would do if you’d seen it.
  MasterChef in the Park Ever wonder what it’s like to present a BBC cooking
  contest? This is your chance! The chefs are all professionals, the cooking
  happens in real time, the tense music is provided by a live band and you are
  one of the judges. MasterChef in the Park is more than a free admission
  immersive experience – it’s an open audition, and we’re in a bit of a hurry,
  so delete your social media account, get some headshots done and come on down.
  Fatberg Subterranean Challenge Lucky ticket-holders are directed to a secret
  location in central London, where they’ll don hazmat suits before descending
  into a stunningly realistic recreation of an overburdened Victorian sewer. The
  journey is almost a kilometre long, with the only exit blocked by a bus-sized
  agglomeration of cooking fat and baby wipes. Can you dig your way free (spades
  provided) in time for light refreshments (not included in ticket price) at the
  far end? Rumours that this immersive experience is just a cheap way of
  addressing an acute manpower shortage have been denied by the production
  company (see FAQs). Either way, you’ll never put bacon grease down the sink
  again.
