  Wolf Children review – Mamoru Hosoda’s tender werewolf fable is a minor
  masterpiece
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  The latest in the set of 4K Mamoru Hosoda rereleases might be his strongest
  work, a graceful and emotionally rich fable from 2012 that gathers in its arms
  themes of single motherhood, neighbourliness, ecological conservation and the
  meaning of adult independence. It’s indebted to My Neighbour Totoro in its
  setup: urbanite mum Hana (voiced by Aoi Miyazaki) brings her two werewolf
  children, Yuki (Momoka Ono as a child/Haru Kuroki as a teenager) and Ame (Amon
  Kabe/Yukito Nishii) to a beaten-up country house. While not quite matching the
  Miyazaki masterpiece’s complete storytelling economy, Hosoda achieves a rawer
  sense of wildness and elation by pitching his fantasy closer to young-adult
  realism. Hana has to raise her two transmogrifying toddlers alone after her
  lycanthrope beau (Takao Osawa), whom she first spies across a lecture hall, is
  accidentally killed. (The details of how they conceive their children are best
  glossed over.) With the neighbours asking whether she has pets as well as
  kids, she decides to move the family to the mountains to avoid scrutiny. But
  locals frown on her fumbling attempts to feed everyone from her vegetable
  patch, as she simultaneously struggles to cope with Yuki and Ame’s bestial and
  human needs. Her son is a clingy mother’s boy, while her daughter is a
  whirlwind of claws and teeth who awkwardly insists on starting proper human
  school. Wolf Children doesn’t follow the typical moon- or emotion-related
  rules of lycanthrope transformation; Yuki and Ame are able to change back and
  forth at will. Hosoda also shows a marvellous flexibility with the animal
  conceit, which expresses many things, some in tension with one another: the
  alien contact of love, the uncontrollable nature of children, a longing for a
  state of innocence, puberty’s metamorphosis, the imperative to let your
  offspring run free. Yuki, embarrassed about her inner nature, and Ame,
  horrified by the demonisation of wolves and drawn to the mountains, diverge.
  But they mirror their parents, as she draws closer to her normie classmate
  Sōhei (Takuma Hiraoka), and he emulates his absent dad. Hosoda tells his story
  with a subdued simplicity compared with the digital convolutions of Summer
  Wars, Belle and even the realm-switching Mirai. His stripped-back characters
  stand out with fantastical boldness against impeccably realist backgrounds
  (though he occasionally accelerates into hyper-real first-person sequences, as
  when the siblings dash out into the snowy countryside). Swept up in potent
  nostalgia for early parenthood, childhood and the cradle of nature itself,
  this is a modern classic. • Wolf Children is in UK and Irish cinemas from 17
  August.
