  When Donald Trump remained on stage, grinning in the sun as Chelsea lifted the
  Club World Cup trophy last month, it was all too easy to treat the incident as
  a one-off mistake. A moment that said plenty about Trump’s ego, sure. But
  ultimately, only a moment. Nope. It’s reality. Inescapable. Donald Trump will
  be everywhere Fifa is in the US, including at the 2026 World Cup – due to
  start in about 10 months, when Canada and Mexico will co-host. If this much
  wasn’t clear already after that moment at MetLife Stadium and all the other
  times Trump or his agenda have affected World Cup affairs, it may have become
  so after Friday’s Oval Office appearance with Fifa president Gianni Infantino
  – the eighth reported meeting between the pair since January, and the fifth to
  take place in public at the White House. Trump wore a signature hat reading
  “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING” – one of his collection that was deemed
  noteworthy enough to display to world leaders in the middle of high-stakes
  talks with lives hanging in the balance. He then announced that the attention
  of the soccer world will once again be on him in December. On the fifth of
  that month, the World Cup draw will take place not at the Las Vegas Sphere as
  had been widely expected, but at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center – a historic
  venue and a worthy place to sort through some ping-pong balls, but also one
  that is now controlled by Trump, who has installed himself as chair, named
  himself as host of the institution’s annual honors, overseen upcoming
  renovations (“there’s nothing like gold,” he said on Friday in reference to
  his Oval Office redesign), and may soon lend his wife’s name to the opera
  house. “Some people refer to it as the ‘Trump Kennedy Center,’ but we’re not
  prepared to do that quite yet,” Trump said on Friday. “Maybe in a week or so.”
  The World Cup is not federally controlled like the Kennedy Center, but it will
  now be subject to a similar dynamic. The tournament Trump has taken credit for
  bringing to the US will take place under his presidency, with the draw and
  “big press conferences” happening in a venue he controls, put on by an
  organization run by someone looking to befriend Trump at every turn –
  including by becoming the Trump Organization’s tenant. There is almost no
  choice other than to accept that Trump will make sure he is front and center
  at this tournament – even in spots where he has no business, or where his
  involvement may be seen as uncouth or inappropriate. It’s a dynamic Americans
  know well now, more than a decade into Trump’s rise. Trump announced this
  after Infantino allowed him to hold the single most valuable hardware in men’s
  soccer, the World Cup trophy – not unheard of for heads of state, but more
  uncommon when accompanied with Infantino’s comment: “Since you are a winner,
  of course, you can as well touch it.” Trump asked if he could keep the trophy
  afterward, and it was not immediately clear that he was joking, given that
  Infantino let him keep the Club World Cup trophy, where it has been on display
  in the Oval Office ever since. Trump made this latest World Cup announcement
  in practically the same breath as he expounded on his latest imposition on the
  American people – a strong-arm takeover of Washington DC, which he called a
  “crime-infested rat hole” despite the fact that the Justice Department had
  reported a 30-year low in violent crime in the capital. Trump continued to
  promote his crackdown later on, with the trophy directly in front of him on
  the Resolute Desk, as if it was a microphone meant to amplify his message.
  When Trump got to talking about immigration, Infantino moved the trophy out of
  the way. When prompted by Trump on Friday, Infantino – rather than demurring
  to comment on the domestic affairs of a foreign country – gave a solemn “oh
  yes” to express approval of the president’s plan for DC. It’s a plan Trump
  said he intends to spread to other American cities, mentioning Chicago
  specifically, but one can easily imagine that any city that voted against him
  – like 10 of the 11 US host cities for the upcoming World Cup – would be on
  the list. “Johnny”, as Trump calls Infantino, then gifted him a ceremonial
  ticket to the World Cup final – row 1, seat 1. Given all of this, expect the
  World Cup final camera to linger on Trump’s face longer than many of the
  players, coaches, and team staff who will have worked all their professional
  lives to get to that point. You’ll see him at the World Cup before then, too.
  He’ll boast endlessly about how well the tournament is going, only changing
  tack if things get so bad it’s obvious to everyone, in which case he’ll blame
  someone else (watch your back, “Johnny”). He’ll do at least one half-time
  interview on Fox, which is broadcasting the tournament in the US. Alexi Lalas,
  a big fan of Trump’s Maga movement, will shake his hand. Don’t rule out a
  gold-encrusted seat waiting for Trump at the final and any other games he
  chooses to attend. There can be no doubt now – the World Cup is not a guest in
  the house Trump runs. It is his plaything. And Fifa appears happy to do
  anything it takes for things to remain that way lest world football’s
  governing body be discarded or, worse, made a target. The World Cup, beneath
  all of the commercialism, is almost comically pure-hearted. It’s a celebration
  of the most popular sport in the world. It gives people across the world
  something in common to talk about, to bond over, to yell at. That feeling goes
  double for the host nations, and it’s a large part of the tournament’s
  singular power. It’s why it’s so coveted by countries that rule through
  authoritarian means – and that now arguably includes the US under Trump
  Indelible, sublime moments will still happen at the 2026 tournament. People
  will still take joy, hurt, anger, and feelings from them. But those moments
  will be punctuated by Trump – eternally encroaching on even the most elevated
  of emotional experiences. If this news drives you to boo, ready your vocal
  cords. If it drives you to act, start thinking about what you want that to
  look like. If it thrills you, pace yourself. Either way, it’s time to get used
  to it.
