  Strongest rise in UK business activity in a year while hiring falls; WH Smith
  shares crash 40% on accounting error –as it happened

  The latest monthly PMI surveys have showing stronger business activity in the
  UK, eurozone and the US, with inflationary pressures hitting a three-year high
  stateside on the back of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Washington will not
  lower steep tariffs on European cars until Brussels has introduced legislation
  to reduce its own tariffs on US exports, maintaining pressure on the EU’s
  automotive industry. While the Trump administration has agreed to lower the
  current 27.5% US tariffs on European cars and car parts to 15%, details of a
  framework trade deal published on Thursday revealed the terms and conditions.
  The US president and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen
  announced the deal on 27 July at Trump’s luxury golf course in Turnberry,
  Scotland after an hour-long meeting that followed months of negotiations. WH
  Smith shares have plunged almost 40% as the retailer cut financial forecasts
  and launched an independent review after discovering an accounting blunder
  that led it to overstate profits by £30m. Investors wiped almost £550m off the
  retailer’s market value on Thursday morning as it reported the
  multimillion-pound accounting error, sending the stock price down to £6.76 a
  share. The group discovered the mistake, which related to its North American
  business, while preparing its year-end results. The stationery to sweets
  retailer said it was “largely” because it had logged some of its income too
  early. The mistake relates to arrangements it has with suppliers, which offer
  rebates if the retailer hits sales targets on certain items and payments for
  marketing and promotions. It is understood, however, that income should have
  been logged in accounts for the next financial year rather than for the 12
  months to 31 August. Our other main stories today: Many thanks for reading –
  we’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK US business activity hit an eight-month
  peak in August, while selling price inflation rose to a three-year high on the
  back of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The PMI survey from S&amp;P Global, a monthly
  snapshot, showed that the headline output index rose to 55.4 from 55.1 in
  July, indicating faster growth in the private sector. Business confidence
  improved but remained much weaker than at the start of the year, as companies
  reiterated concerns over the impact of government policies, especially in
  relation to tariffs. Tariffs were again widely cited as the main cause of
  sharply higher costs, which in turn fed through to the steepest rise in
  average selling prices recorded over the past three years. This tariff impact
  has yet to show up in the official inflation readings. Chris Williamson, chief
  business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: A strong flash
  PMI reading for August adds to signs that US businesses have enjoyed a strong
  third quarter so far. The data are consistent with the economy expanding at a
  2.5% annualized rate, up from the average 1.3% expansion seen over the first
  two quarters of the year. Companies across both manufacturing and services are
  reporting stronger demand conditions, but are struggling to meet sales growth,
  causing backlogs of work to rise at a pace not seen since the pandemic-related
  capacity constraints recorded in early 2022. Stock building of finished goods
  has also risen at a survey record pace, linked in part to worries over future
  supply conditions. While this upturn in demand has fueled a surge in hiring,
  it has also bolstered firms’ pricing power. Companies have consequently passed
  tariff-related cost increases through to customers in increasing numbers,
  indicating that inflation pressures are now at their highest for three years.
  What does this mean for interest rates? He said: The resulting rise in selling
  prices for goods and services suggests that consumer price inflation will rise
  further above the Fed’s 2% target in the coming months. Indeed, combined with
  the upturn in business activity and hiring, the rise in prices signaled by the
  survey puts the PMI data more into rate hiking, rather than cutting, territory
  according to the historical relationship between these economic indicators and
  FOMC policy changes. The trade deal between the US and the EU does not include
  wine and spirits, according to the EUs trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, but
  he said the European Commission would try to negotiate tariff reductions for
  the sector and others not included in the agreement. His remarks came after
  the two sides released details of the commitments made in a deal reached last
  month that includes a 15% US tariff on most imports from the bloc, including
  autos, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber. Referring to wines and
  spirits, Šefčovič said: This one we didn’t get in. But I can tell you that
  there is clear commitment from the European Commission to put it on the table.
  The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States expressed disappointment.
  Without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits, American
  distillers do not have the certainty to plan for future export and job growth
  without the fear of retaliatory tariffs returning. It added that it was
  “determined to continue engaging with the Trump administration to urge for
  additional negotiations”. Getting started in the world of work was not easy
  for Rose Green. Having experienced half a dozen children’s homes from the age
  of 13 while growing up in care in north London, finding a career was the last
  thing on her mind. “Having that corporate parenting, it can be difficult,” she
  says. “Sometimes things like completing school, or uni, you’re faced with so
  much trauma that you haven’t really got the time to finish all of that.
  “You’re kind of parenting yourself, raising yourself. But you’re a child.
  You’re just cracking on doing what you think you’re supposed to do. Even
  today, I’m still figuring it out.” Despite those challenges, the 26-year-old
  from Camden has found work as an employment and training officer at the local
  council. After completing a care leaver internship, she now helps others to
  overcome the same hurdles. Tesco has put up the price of its meal deal by 25p,
  its third increase since 2022, in a sign of the times as food prices in the UK
  race higher again. The meal deal now costs £3.85 for Clubcard holders,
  increasing from £3.60. Customers who do not have a Tesco loyalty card will
  find themselves shelling out £4.25, up from £4. The new rate will be charged
  from 21 August. It comes as the latest inflation figures show the price of
  food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 4.9% year on year in July, an increase
  from 4.5% in the 12 months to June. For retailers, this often means passing on
  the soaring cost of ingredients to consumers. A summer of heatwaves and
  droughts in parts of Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources a lot of
  its fresh fruit and vegetables, have pushed up prices this summer, at a time
  when they would usually fall. Beef, orange juice, coffee and chocolate were
  among the worst-hit products. Some shoppers have described the price hike as
  “truly devastating”. On X, one user wrote: “Discovering that a Tesco meal deal
  will be £3.85 *with* a Clubcard from Thursday was truly devastating. Another
  questioned whether it can still be called a “deal”. “Tesco meal deal now £4
  not sure of the deal part,” they wrote. Tesco’s sandwich, snack and drink deal
  had cost £3 for 10 years before prices jumped in October 2022. However, Tesco
  is not the first of the major retailers to frustrate customers after upping
  the cost of it’s meal deal. In June, Sainsbury’s increased the price of it’s
  standard offering by 5%, going from £3.75 to £3.95. It was the second time it
  had increased the price in under a year, after raising the price by 25p in
  July 2024. The US and the European Union have locked in a framework trade deal
  that was reached last month. It includes a 15% US tariff on most imported
  goods from the EU, including cars, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber.
  In a 3 1/2 page joint statement, the two sides listed the commitments made,
  including the EU’s pledge remove tariffs on all US industrial goods and to
  provide preferential market access for a wide range of US seafood and
  agricultural products. Washington has pledged to reduce the current 27.5% US
  tariffs on cars and car components – a huge burden for European carmakers –
  once Brussels introduces legislation needed to enact the promised tariff
  reductions on US goods. The joint statement also noted the EU’s intention to
  source $750bn in US liquefied natural gas, oil and nuclear energy, and an
  additional $40bn of US-made artificial intelligence chips. It included the
  plan for EU companies to invest an additional $600bn across US strategic
  sectors through 2028. A senior US administration official told Reuters that
  Euroepan carmakers could see the current 27.5% tariff reduced within
  “hopefully weeks”. As soon as they’re able to introduce that legislation – and
  I don’t mean pass it and fully implement it, but really introduce it – then we
  will be in a position to provide that relief. And I will say that both sides
  are ver interested in moving quickly. Donald Trump and European Commission
  president Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal on 27 July at the US
  president’s luxury golf course in Scotland after an hour-long meeting, and
  months of negotiations between officials. At the time, the French prime
  minister, François Bayrou, said the EU had capitulated to Trump’s threats of
  ever-increasing tariffs, as he labelled the framework deal struck in Scotland
  as a “dark day” for the EU. The sell-off has intensified after WH Smith’s £30m
  accounting blunder and profit downgrade, and its shares are now down by 40%,
  at 668.5p. They slumped as much as 40.9% to 656p, their lowest level since
  March 2020. The broker Peel Hunt has cut its recommendation on the stock to
  ‘hold’ from ‘add’, and slashed its target share price to 755p from 1400p
  (£14). The retail analyst Nick Bubb said the profit warning had “gone down
  like a lead balloon with investors”, adding that it was “reviving unhappy
  memories of the Tesco accounting scandal a few years back”. In 2014, Tesco
  admitted it had overstated profits by £326m because it had incorrectly booked
  payments from suppliers relating to issues such as marketing costs or reaching
  sales targets. The UK’s biggest retailer took years to recover from the black
  hole in its accounts. There is no suggestion WH Smith’s accounting mistake
  relates to the same issues that hit the supermarket chain. Here’s some
  analysis of today’s UK public finance figures: Despite a good month for the
  public finances, the Treasury won’t be putting in any champagne orders. Higher
  self-assessment tax receipts and an increase in national insurance payments by
  employers filled the government’s coffers by more than expected in July. The
  result was that Rachel Reeves’s spending deficit fell to £1.1bn, down by
  £2.3bn from the same month a year earlier. That would be cheery news in normal
  circumstances, but hemmed in by tight fiscal rules, jittery financial markets
  and a restless public, the chancellor knows not to be complacent. There is
  every likelihood that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will
  downgrade its outlook for economic growth when Reeves presents her autumn
  budget, forcing the government to take further action to balance the books.
  James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, is to exit the upmarket supermarket next
  month after just over five years. His departure comes a year after the arrival
  of former Tesco executive Jason Tarry as chairman of the grocer’s parent
  company the John Lewis Partnership. Tarry said: James has done an outstanding
  job, overseeing significant transformation and growth during a period of
  change. He’s a great colleague and has been a highly valued member of the
  executive team. We will be sad to see James go but understand and respect his
  decision to step down after five and a half years at the helm. James will
  leave Waitrose in a much stronger position and I know will be missed by
  everyone. Tina Mitchell, the retail director for Waitrose will step in to
  replace Bailey on an interim basis from the end of September while the company
  looks to recruit a permanent replacement. Bailey said: I’m very proud of
  everything we’ve achieved together; it’s been a lot of hard work but very
  rewarding and I’m so happy now to see the business thriving. More good news:
  the UK’s business activity posted its biggest growth in a year this month, led
  by a solid upturn in the service sector, according to a closely-watched
  survey. The ‘flash’ reading from the S&amp;P Global PMI survey showed
  improvement across the private sector, despite employment remaining a weak
  spot, with companies cutting hiring for an eleventh month. The headline index
  rose to 53.0 in August from 51.5 in July, indicating faster expansion in
  business activity. Input cost inflation edged up to its highest since May.
  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market
  Intelligence, The flash UK PMI survey for August indicated that the pace of
  economic growth has continued to accelerate over the summer after a sluggish
  spring, the rate of expansion now at a one-year high. The services sector has
  led the expansion, but manufacturing also showed further signs of stabilising.
  He cautioned that order books show that demand remains “uneven and fragile”.
  Companies report concerns over the impact of recent government policy changes,
  as well as unease emanating from broader geopolitical uncertainty. Goods
  exports are still falling especially sharply. Payroll numbers also continue to
  be cut at an aggressive rate by historical standards as firms cite weak order
  books and concerns over rising staff costs due to the policies announced in
  the autumn Budget, which also contributed to persistent inflation pressures.
  While the rise in business activity signalled by the PMI alongside the uplift
  in inflation to 3.8% in July lower the chances of further rate cuts this year,
  more data are required to assess both the sustainability of robust economic
  growth as well as the stickiness of the upturn in price pressures. Among a
  divided Bank of England rate setting committee, the perceived need for any
  future rate cuts will be very much data dependent. WH Smith shares have fallen
  as much as 36%, wiping £500m off the stationery to sweets retailer’s market
  value. It cut its financial forecasts and launched an independent review after
  an accounting blunder led the retailer to overstate profits by £30m. The group
  discovered the mistake, which related to its North American business, while
  preparing its year-end results. The travel retailer said it was “largely”
  because it had logged some of its income too early. This is related to
  arrangements it has with suppliers, which offer rebates if the retailer hits
  sales targets on certain items. However, it is understood that those rebates
  should have been logged in accounts for the next financial year rather than
  for the 12 months to 31 August. The problem is believed to be contained to the
  North American business. The drop in WH Smith’s shares left its value below
  £900m on Thursday morning, down from £1.4bn at the market close on Wednesday.
  Things are also looking up in the eurozone, where new orders increased for the
  first time in 15 months in August, helping lift business activity. Companies
  also increased their staffing levels for the sixth month running. Meanwhile,
  inflationary pressures strengthened, with both input costs and output prices
  rising at sharper rates in August. However, foreign orders in the
  manufacturing sector have been affected by Donald Trump’s trade policy. The
  flash composite headline index for the eurozone from Hamburg Commercial Bank
  rose to 51.1 from 50.9 in July, indicating the fastest expansion in business
  activity since June 2024. This was driven by the manufacturing sector, where
  production increased at the fastest pace in almost three-and-a-half years.
  Meanwhile, services business activity rose for the third month running, albeit
  only slightly and to a smaller degree than in July. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief
  economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: Things are getting better.
  Economic activity has picked up in both manufacturing and services. Overall,
  we’ve seen a slight acceleration in growth over the past three months. Despite
  headwinds like US tariffs and general uncertainty, businesses across the
  eurozone seem to be coping reasonably well. The EU Single Market is likely
  playing a helpful role here, especially since most export and tourism revenues
  are generated within the EU. The European Central Bank might wince a little at
  the rising cost pressures in the services sector. After all, it’s banking on
  slower wage growth to help bring inflation down in this crucial part of the
  economy. That said, there’s a bit of relief in the fact that inflation in
  service-sector selling prices has remained more or less steady. Manufacturing
  output has increased for six straight months, with Germany leading the charge.
  France, which had been a drag in June and July, showed signs of stabilising in
  August. The same goes for services: France’s recession seems to be tapering
  off, while Germany is showing growth even if only marginal. However, US trade
  policy is leaving its mark, he noted. Foreign orders in the eurozone
  manufacturing sector have declined for the second month in a row. Germany had
  been holding up well, possibly due to pre-emptive purchases from the US, but
  now it’s also seeing a drop in orders. France has climbed out of the deep hole
  of falling foreign demand over the last months, but incoming orders are still
  on the decline. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, business activity
  improved for a third month, with the pace of growth the fastest since March,
  but remained modest. The flash Germany composite PMI output index from Hamburg
  Commercial Bank came in at 50.9 in August, up slightly from 50.6 in July.
  Solid and faster production growth in the manufacturing sector (index at
  52.6), which was supported by an increase in new orders at factories, compared
  with near-stagnant levels of activity in the service sector (index at 50.1).
  Employment fell modestly in August, extending a period of declines that
  stretches back to June last year. The rate at which workforce numbers fell was
  faster than the month before, reflecting deeper job cuts in the
  goods-producing sector. This masked a slight pick-up in the pace of hiring in
  the service sector, where employment levels have risen continuously on a
  monthly basis since the start of the year. After reaching a six-month high in
  July, German business expectations retreated somewhat in August, although
  firms generally remained optimistic about the year-ahead outlook. Cyrus de la
  Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: “ Germany’s economy
  has been growing throughout the summer so far, and the pace of expansion has
  even picked up slightly. While we’re talking about modest gains here, this
  trend signals resilience – considering the headwinds like US tariffs,
  geopolitical uncertainty, and relatively high long-term interest rates. The
  recovery is being driven primarily by the manufacturing sector, where output
  has now increased for six consecutive months, with the latest data showing a
  noticeable uptick. Particularly encouraging is the surge in new orders, which
  saw their strongest growth since March 2022. That said, a certain degree of
  caution remains among businesses. Stocks of inputs continue to decline
  sharply, which aligns with reduced purchasing activity. This suggests
  companies are still playing it safe. He said job cuts in manufacturing are
  likely part of a broader effort to boost productivity and sharpen
  competitiveness. At least in the short term, this seems to be working – output
  has risen significantly. Input prices in manufacturing have fallen, helped by
  lower oil prices and a relatively strong euro. On the sales side,
  manufacturers have passed on some of these cost savings to their customers. In
  contrast, the services sector saw the opposite trend in August: costs rose
  more sharply – likely due to rising wages – and companies had enough pricing
  power to pass parts of those increases on to their clients. After a long
  period of contraction in France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy, there
  are signs of stabilising business conditions, with hiring picking up. August’s
  ‘flash’ purchasing managers’ index survey from Hamburg Commercial Bank showed
  French private sector output was broadly unchanged on the month, as the
  headline index edged higher towards the 50 no change, rising from July’s 48.6
  to 49.8 this month – the highest reading in a year. Both manufacturers and
  service providers posted small declines on the month. For the first time since
  November, employment levels increased, with the rate of job creation at a
  16-month high. The pick-up in hiring came despite a pessimistic 12-month
  outlook and continued weak demand. Jonas Feldhusen, junior economist at
  Hamburg Commercial Bank, said there was still no clear turning point despite
  the slight improvement in overall business activity. On a more positive note,
  both the manufacturing and services sectors saw less pronounced contractions,
  which could be interpreted with cautious optimism as an early sign of
  stabilisation. The services sector reflects the broader economic picture.
  Business activity continues to lack growth momentum. The current order
  situation, especially the sharp deterioration in foreign demand during August,
  offers little hope for a near-term recovery. Service providers remain cautious
  in their expectations. Price dynamics have remained relatively stable, but
  input costs are rising faster than output prices, which suggests that margins
  may come under pressure. France’s manufacturing sector continues to feel the
  strain. Long-standing challenges like weakening international competitiveness
  and the rise of protectionist policies are shaping a difficult environment.
  Global supply chains are probably still recalibrating to new tariff regimes,
  and that’s possibly a reason for noticeably longer delivery times. While the
  sharp and rapid drop in order volumes seen last month wasn’t repeated in
  August, the mood among producers has hardly improved. Shares in WH Smith have
  plummeted by more than 30% after the travel retailer cut its profit forecast.
  The company now expects pre-tax profit for the year to 31 August to be around
  £110m. In April, it was still confident of hitting market expectations of
  £182.6m. The share price fell by nearly 31% to 769p, making it the top loser
  on the FTSE mid-cap index and taking the company’s market value below £1bn, to
  around £900m. WH Smith said a financial review had found an overstatement of
  £30m of expected headline trading profit in North America, and blamed the
  accelerated recognition of supplier income in the region. North America
  profits are now estimated to be £25m, rather than £55m. The group has
  instructed the accounting firm Deloitte to carry out an “independent and
  comprehensive review”. The 230-year-old British business has just sold its
  highstreet stores to the investment company Modella Capital, but was forced to
  cut the sale price by £12m to around £40m after trading at the chain
  deteriorated. While the high street business, which employs about 5,000
  people, will be rebranded as TGJones, WH Smith is retaining its brand for its
  travel shops in railway stations, airports and hospitals. On the pension
  theme… Retired women in the UK in effect go four months of the year without a
  pension when their income is compared with that of men, union leaders have
  warned. The TUC said the income gap between men and women in retirement was
  36.5%, equivalent to a shortfall of £7,600 a year on average. As a percentage
  this was more than double the gender pay gap, which measures the difference in
  average earnings from work; it stands at 13.1%. The union organisation said
  this meant that retired women effectively stopped receiving a pension from 21
  August when compared with men, creating a four-month gap. Paul Nowak, the
  general secretary of the TUC, said the income gap between men and women in
  retirement should be central to the inquiry by the pensions commission, which
  the government launched last month. The chancellor will still have to raise
  taxes in October despite borrowing matching official forecasts, summed up
  Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He is
  predicting “sin” and “stealth” tax hikes, duty increases and a pensions tax
  raid. The big picture remains that the public finances are in chronically weak
  condition. The chancellor faces surging gilt yields and a likely productivity
  downgrade from the OBR in the October forecast round. The litany of policy
  uturns has only compounded the government’s fiscal woes. We think the
  chancellor will need to resort to ’sin’ and ’stealth’ tax hikes, duty
  increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she
  wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged. We expect
  the bulk of those tax hikes to be backloaded towards the end of the forecast
  period, minimising any short-term growth implications. But that will buy the
  Chancellor only precious little time. The public finances are unsustainable in
  the long-run and delaying action now increases the risks of needing to make
  sharper adjustments in the future, which would be more disruptive for economic
  activity. Nabil Taleb, economist at PwC UK, echoed those comments. Although
  tax receipts rose in July, the chancellor remains under pressure as she tries
  to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules she has committed to. While the
  government’s manifesto promises to maintain investment and shield working
  people from tax hikes, analysis from NIESR suggests up to £40bn in additional
  revenue may be needed to restore headroom and maintain investor confidence in
  the UK’s public finances. As the chancellor prepares for the autumn budget,
  the challenge will be finding creative sources of revenue while treading
  carefully around the impact on living standards. However, the outlook has not
  improved much, said Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics. Ultimately,
  today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the budget
  later this year. The government’s u-turns on spending cuts and potential
  upward revisions to the office for Budget Responsibility’s borrowing forecasts
  mean the chancellor may need to raise £17-27bn at the Autumn Budget to
  maintain the £9.9bn of headroom against her fiscal mandate. And given that she
  is struggling to stick to existing spending plans and we doubt the gilt market
  will tolerate significant increases in borrowing, most of that will have to be
  funded by tax rises. The ONS said central government tax receipts increased by
  £14.8bn to £264.7bn in the financial year so far. This included increases of
  £7.7bn in income tax, £3.2bn in VAT and £2.5bn in corporation tax. Compulsory
  social contributions increased by £9.5bn to £63.8bn, after changes to the rate
  of national insurance contributions paid by employers came into effect on 6
  April. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the
  financial markets and the world economy. The UK government borrowed £1.1bn
  last month, the lowest July borrowing for three years, in a boost to the
  chancellor ahead of her autumn budget. The figure was £2.3bn lower than a year
  earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. It was also below
  economists’ forecasts. Income tax receipts via self assessment totalled
  £15.5bn, £2.7bn more than in July 2024. So far this financial year, from April
  to July, borrowing totalled £60bn, £6.7bn higher than in the same period last
  year, and the third-highest borrowing for the period since records began,
  after those of 2020 and 2021. It is in line with the Office for Budget
  Responsibility’s forecast of £59.9bn for that period. Darren Jones, Chief
  Secretary to the Treasury, said: We’re investing in our public services, and
  modernising the state, to improve outcomes and reduce costs in the medium
  term. Far too much taxpayer money is spent on interest payments for the
  longstanding national debt. That’s why we’re driving down government borrowing
  over the course of the parliament – so working people don’t have to foot the
  bill and we can invest in better schools, hospitals, and services for working
  families. The FTSE 100 index managed a record close on Wednesday even though
  UK inflation came in hotter than expected. The index rose by 1.3%, its
  strongest daily performance since May, to 9,288, a gain of 98 points. Many
  Asian stock markets have made modest gains, while Japan’s Nikkei fell by 0.6%
  and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.3%. On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq
  closed lower again, by 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.2% and the Dow
  Jones was flat. The minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting last night
  showed two governors backed a cut. Policymakers on the federal open market
  committee (FOMC) worried about the state of the labour market and elevated
  inflation, but most agreed that it was too soon to cut interest rates. Ipek
  Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: Yesterday’s FOMC
  minutes further dampened investor mood and accelerated the equity selloff –
  again led by a significant drop across Big Tech. The minutes stated that Fed
  officials were worried about both weakening jobs data and inflation risks, but
  that “a majority of participants judged the upside risks to inflation as the
  greater of these two risks.” That means officials remain inclined to
  prioritise inflation control by keeping monetary policy tight rather than
  cutting rates. Yet, one caveat makes the minutes look less hawkish than they
  first appeared: this meeting was held before the release of the problematic
  July jobs report – with big downside revisions – that spooked investors and
  fueled expectations for a September cut. Jerome Powell’s speech tomorrow could
  therefore strike a middle ground: acknowledging rising concern about the
  labour market, while underscoring that inflation remains a key risk to be
  addressed carefully. The Agenda Jackson Hole Symposium in Kansas 8.15am BST:

The latest monthly PMI surveys have showing stronger business activity in the UK, eurozone and the US, with inflationary pressures hitting a three-year high stateside on the back of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Washington will not lower steep tariffs on European cars until Brussels has introduced legislation to reduce its own tariffs on US exports, maintaining pressure on the EU’s automotive industry. While the Trump administration has agreed to lower the current 27.5% US tariffs on European cars and car parts to 15%, details of a framework trade deal published on Thursday revealed the terms and conditions. The US president and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal on 27 July at Trump’s luxury golf course in Turnberry, Scotland after an hour-long meeting that followed months of negotiations. WH Smith shares have plunged almost 40% as the retailer cut financial forecasts and launched an independent review after discovering an accounting blunder that led it to overstate profits by £30m. Investors wiped almost £550m off the retailer’s market value on Thursday morning as it reported the multimillion-pound accounting error, sending the stock price down to £6.76 a share. The group discovered the mistake, which related to its North American business, while preparing its year-end results. The stationery to sweets retailer said it was “largely” because it had logged some of its income too early. The mistake relates to arrangements it has with suppliers, which offer rebates if the retailer hits sales targets on certain items and payments for marketing and promotions. It is understood, however, that income should have been logged in accounts for the next financial year rather than for the 12 months to 31 August. Our other main stories today: Many thanks for reading – we’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK US business activity hit an eight-month peak in August, while selling price inflation rose to a three-year high on the back of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The PMI survey from S&amp;P Global, a monthly snapshot, showed that the headline output index rose to 55.4 from 55.1 in July, indicating faster growth in the private sector. Business confidence improved but remained much weaker than at the start of the year, as companies reiterated concerns over the impact of government policies, especially in relation to tariffs. Tariffs were again widely cited as the main cause of sharply higher costs, which in turn fed through to the steepest rise in average selling prices recorded over the past three years. This tariff impact has yet to show up in the official inflation readings. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: A strong flash PMI reading for August adds to signs that US businesses have enjoyed a strong third quarter so far. The data are consistent with the economy expanding at a 2.5% annualized rate, up from the average 1.3% expansion seen over the first two quarters of the year. Companies across both manufacturing and services are reporting stronger demand conditions, but are struggling to meet sales growth, causing backlogs of work to rise at a pace not seen since the pandemic-related capacity constraints recorded in early 2022. Stock building of finished goods has also risen at a survey record pace, linked in part to worries over future supply conditions. While this upturn in demand has fueled a surge in hiring, it has also bolstered firms’ pricing power. Companies have consequently passed tariff-related cost increases through to customers in increasing numbers, indicating that inflation pressures are now at their highest for three years. What does this mean for interest rates? He said: The resulting rise in selling prices for goods and services suggests that consumer price inflation will rise further above the Fed’s 2% target in the coming months. Indeed, combined with the upturn in business activity and hiring, the rise in prices signaled by the survey puts the PMI data more into rate hiking, rather than cutting, territory according to the historical relationship between these economic indicators and FOMC policy changes. The trade deal between the US and the EU does not include wine and spirits, according to the EUs trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, but he said the European Commission would try to negotiate tariff reductions for the sector and others not included in the agreement. His remarks came after the two sides released details of the commitments made in a deal reached last month that includes a 15% US tariff on most imports from the bloc, including autos, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber. Referring to wines and spirits, Šefčovič said: This one we didn’t get in. But I can tell you that there is clear commitment from the European Commission to put it on the table. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States expressed disappointment. Without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits, American distillers do not have the certainty to plan for future export and job growth without the fear of retaliatory tariffs returning. It added that it was “determined to continue engaging with the Trump administration to urge for additional negotiations”. Getting started in the world of work was not easy for Rose Green. Having experienced half a dozen children’s homes from the age of 13 while growing up in care in north London, finding a career was the last thing on her mind. “Having that corporate parenting, it can be difficult,” she says. “Sometimes things like completing school, or uni, you’re faced with so much trauma that you haven’t really got the time to finish all of that. “You’re kind of parenting yourself, raising yourself. But you’re a child. You’re just cracking on doing what you think you’re supposed to do. Even today, I’m still figuring it out.” Despite those challenges, the 26-year-old from Camden has found work as an employment and training officer at the local council. After completing a care leaver internship, she now helps others to overcome the same hurdles. Tesco has put up the price of its meal deal by 25p, its third increase since 2022, in a sign of the times as food prices in the UK race higher again. The meal deal now costs £3.85 for Clubcard holders, increasing from £3.60. Customers who do not have a Tesco loyalty card will find themselves shelling out £4.25, up from £4. The new rate will be charged from 21 August. It comes as the latest inflation figures show the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 4.9% year on year in July, an increase from 4.5% in the 12 months to June. For retailers, this often means passing on the soaring cost of ingredients to consumers. A summer of heatwaves and droughts in parts of Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources a lot of its fresh fruit and vegetables, have pushed up prices this summer, at a time when they would usually fall. Beef, orange juice, coffee and chocolate were among the worst-hit products. Some shoppers have described the price hike as “truly devastating”. On X, one user wrote: “Discovering that a Tesco meal deal will be £3.85 *with* a Clubcard from Thursday was truly devastating. Another questioned whether it can still be called a “deal”. “Tesco meal deal now £4 not sure of the deal part,” they wrote. Tesco’s sandwich, snack and drink deal had cost £3 for 10 years before prices jumped in October 2022. However, Tesco is not the first of the major retailers to frustrate customers after upping the cost of it’s meal deal. In June, Sainsbury’s increased the price of it’s standard offering by 5%, going from £3.75 to £3.95. It was the second time it had increased the price in under a year, after raising the price by 25p in July 2024. The US and the European Union have locked in a framework trade deal that was reached last month. It includes a 15% US tariff on most imported goods from the EU, including cars, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber. In a 3 1/2 page joint statement, the two sides listed the commitments made, including the EU’s pledge remove tariffs on all US industrial goods and to provide preferential market access for a wide range of US seafood and agricultural products. Washington has pledged to reduce the current 27.5% US tariffs on cars and car components – a huge burden for European carmakers – once Brussels introduces legislation needed to enact the promised tariff reductions on US goods. The joint statement also noted the EU’s intention to source $750bn in US liquefied natural gas, oil and nuclear energy, and an additional $40bn of US-made artificial intelligence chips. It included the plan for EU companies to invest an additional $600bn across US strategic sectors through 2028. A senior US administration official told Reuters that Euroepan carmakers could see the current 27.5% tariff reduced within “hopefully weeks”. As soon as they’re able to introduce that legislation – and I don’t mean pass it and fully implement it, but really introduce it – then we will be in a position to provide that relief. And I will say that both sides are ver interested in moving quickly. Donald Trump and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal on 27 July at the US president’s luxury golf course in Scotland after an hour-long meeting, and months of negotiations between officials. At the time, the French prime minister, François Bayrou, said the EU had capitulated to Trump’s threats of ever-increasing tariffs, as he labelled the framework deal struck in Scotland as a “dark day” for the EU. The sell-off has intensified after WH Smith’s £30m accounting blunder and profit downgrade, and its shares are now down by 40%, at 668.5p. They slumped as much as 40.9% to 656p, their lowest level since March 2020. The broker Peel Hunt has cut its recommendation on the stock to ‘hold’ from ‘add’, and slashed its target share price to 755p from 1400p (£14). The retail analyst Nick Bubb said the profit warning had “gone down like a lead balloon with investors”, adding that it was “reviving unhappy memories of the Tesco accounting scandal a few years back”. In 2014, Tesco admitted it had overstated profits by £326m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers relating to issues such as marketing costs or reaching sales targets. The UK’s biggest retailer took years to recover from the black hole in its accounts. There is no suggestion WH Smith’s accounting mistake relates to the same issues that hit the supermarket chain. Here’s some analysis of today’s UK public finance figures: Despite a good month for the public finances, the Treasury won’t be putting in any champagne orders. Higher self-assessment tax receipts and an increase in national insurance payments by employers filled the government’s coffers by more than expected in July. The result was that Rachel Reeves’s spending deficit fell to £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn from the same month a year earlier. That would be cheery news in normal circumstances, but hemmed in by tight fiscal rules, jittery financial markets and a restless public, the chancellor knows not to be complacent. There is every likelihood that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will downgrade its outlook for economic growth when Reeves presents her autumn budget, forcing the government to take further action to balance the books. James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, is to exit the upmarket supermarket next month after just over five years. His departure comes a year after the arrival of former Tesco executive Jason Tarry as chairman of the grocer’s parent company the John Lewis Partnership. Tarry said: James has done an outstanding job, overseeing significant transformation and growth during a period of change. He’s a great colleague and has been a highly valued member of the executive team. We will be sad to see James go but understand and respect his decision to step down after five and a half years at the helm. James will leave Waitrose in a much stronger position and I know will be missed by everyone. Tina Mitchell, the retail director for Waitrose will step in to replace Bailey on an interim basis from the end of September while the company looks to recruit a permanent replacement. Bailey said: I’m very proud of everything we’ve achieved together; it’s been a lot of hard work but very rewarding and I’m so happy now to see the business thriving. More good news: the UK’s business activity posted its biggest growth in a year this month, led by a solid upturn in the service sector, according to a closely-watched survey. The ‘flash’ reading from the S&amp;P Global PMI survey showed improvement across the private sector, despite employment remaining a weak spot, with companies cutting hiring for an eleventh month. The headline index rose to 53.0 in August from 51.5 in July, indicating faster expansion in business activity. Input cost inflation edged up to its highest since May. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, The flash UK PMI survey for August indicated that the pace of economic growth has continued to accelerate over the summer after a sluggish spring, the rate of expansion now at a one-year high. The services sector has led the expansion, but manufacturing also showed further signs of stabilising. He cautioned that order books show that demand remains “uneven and fragile”. Companies report concerns over the impact of recent government policy changes, as well as unease emanating from broader geopolitical uncertainty. Goods exports are still falling especially sharply. Payroll numbers also continue to be cut at an aggressive rate by historical standards as firms cite weak order books and concerns over rising staff costs due to the policies announced in the autumn Budget, which also contributed to persistent inflation pressures. While the rise in business activity signalled by the PMI alongside the uplift in inflation to 3.8% in July lower the chances of further rate cuts this year, more data are required to assess both the sustainability of robust economic growth as well as the stickiness of the upturn in price pressures. Among a divided Bank of England rate setting committee, the perceived need for any future rate cuts will be very much data dependent. WH Smith shares have fallen as much as 36%, wiping £500m off the stationery to sweets retailer’s market value. It cut its financial forecasts and launched an independent review after an accounting blunder led the retailer to overstate profits by £30m. The group discovered the mistake, which related to its North American business, while preparing its year-end results. The travel retailer said it was “largely” because it had logged some of its income too early. This is related to arrangements it has with suppliers, which offer rebates if the retailer hits sales targets on certain items. However, it is understood that those rebates should have been logged in accounts for the next financial year rather than for the 12 months to 31 August. The problem is believed to be contained to the North American business. The drop in WH Smith’s shares left its value below £900m on Thursday morning, down from £1.4bn at the market close on Wednesday. Things are also looking up in the eurozone, where new orders increased for the first time in 15 months in August, helping lift business activity. Companies also increased their staffing levels for the sixth month running. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures strengthened, with both input costs and output prices rising at sharper rates in August. However, foreign orders in the manufacturing sector have been affected by Donald Trump’s trade policy. The flash composite headline index for the eurozone from Hamburg Commercial Bank rose to 51.1 from 50.9 in July, indicating the fastest expansion in business activity since June 2024. This was driven by the manufacturing sector, where production increased at the fastest pace in almost three-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, services business activity rose for the third month running, albeit only slightly and to a smaller degree than in July. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: Things are getting better. Economic activity has picked up in both manufacturing and services. Overall, we’ve seen a slight acceleration in growth over the past three months. Despite headwinds like US tariffs and general uncertainty, businesses across the eurozone seem to be coping reasonably well. The EU Single Market is likely playing a helpful role here, especially since most export and tourism revenues are generated within the EU. The European Central Bank might wince a little at the rising cost pressures in the services sector. After all, it’s banking on slower wage growth to help bring inflation down in this crucial part of the economy. That said, there’s a bit of relief in the fact that inflation in service-sector selling prices has remained more or less steady. Manufacturing output has increased for six straight months, with Germany leading the charge. France, which had been a drag in June and July, showed signs of stabilising in August. The same goes for services: France’s recession seems to be tapering off, while Germany is showing growth even if only marginal. However, US trade policy is leaving its mark, he noted. Foreign orders in the eurozone manufacturing sector have declined for the second month in a row. Germany had been holding up well, possibly due to pre-emptive purchases from the US, but now it’s also seeing a drop in orders. France has climbed out of the deep hole of falling foreign demand over the last months, but incoming orders are still on the decline. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, business activity improved for a third month, with the pace of growth the fastest since March, but remained modest. The flash Germany composite PMI output index from Hamburg Commercial Bank came in at 50.9 in August, up slightly from 50.6 in July. Solid and faster production growth in the manufacturing sector (index at 52.6), which was supported by an increase in new orders at factories, compared with near-stagnant levels of activity in the service sector (index at 50.1). Employment fell modestly in August, extending a period of declines that stretches back to June last year. The rate at which workforce numbers fell was faster than the month before, reflecting deeper job cuts in the goods-producing sector. This masked a slight pick-up in the pace of hiring in the service sector, where employment levels have risen continuously on a monthly basis since the start of the year. After reaching a six-month high in July, German business expectations retreated somewhat in August, although firms generally remained optimistic about the year-ahead outlook. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: “ Germany’s economy has been growing throughout the summer so far, and the pace of expansion has even picked up slightly. While we’re talking about modest gains here, this trend signals resilience – considering the headwinds like US tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty, and relatively high long-term interest rates. The recovery is being driven primarily by the manufacturing sector, where output has now increased for six consecutive months, with the latest data showing a noticeable uptick. Particularly encouraging is the surge in new orders, which saw their strongest growth since March 2022. That said, a certain degree of caution remains among businesses. Stocks of inputs continue to decline sharply, which aligns with reduced purchasing activity. This suggests companies are still playing it safe. He said job cuts in manufacturing are likely part of a broader effort to boost productivity and sharpen competitiveness. At least in the short term, this seems to be working – output has risen significantly. Input prices in manufacturing have fallen, helped by lower oil prices and a relatively strong euro. On the sales side, manufacturers have passed on some of these cost savings to their customers. In contrast, the services sector saw the opposite trend in August: costs rose more sharply – likely due to rising wages – and companies had enough pricing power to pass parts of those increases on to their clients. After a long period of contraction in France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy, there are signs of stabilising business conditions, with hiring picking up. August’s ‘flash’ purchasing managers’ index survey from Hamburg Commercial Bank showed French private sector output was broadly unchanged on the month, as the headline index edged higher towards the 50 no change, rising from July’s 48.6 to 49.8 this month – the highest reading in a year. Both manufacturers and service providers posted small declines on the month. For the first time since November, employment levels increased, with the rate of job creation at a 16-month high. The pick-up in hiring came despite a pessimistic 12-month outlook and continued weak demand. Jonas Feldhusen, junior economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said there was still no clear turning point despite the slight improvement in overall business activity. On a more positive note, both the manufacturing and services sectors saw less pronounced contractions, which could be interpreted with cautious optimism as an early sign of stabilisation. The services sector reflects the broader economic picture. Business activity continues to lack growth momentum. The current order situation, especially the sharp deterioration in foreign demand during August, offers little hope for a near-term recovery. Service providers remain cautious in their expectations. Price dynamics have remained relatively stable, but input costs are rising faster than output prices, which suggests that margins may come under pressure. France’s manufacturing sector continues to feel the strain. Long-standing challenges like weakening international competitiveness and the rise of protectionist policies are shaping a difficult environment. Global supply chains are probably still recalibrating to new tariff regimes, and that’s possibly a reason for noticeably longer delivery times. While the sharp and rapid drop in order volumes seen last month wasn’t repeated in August, the mood among producers has hardly improved. Shares in WH Smith have plummeted by more than 30% after the travel retailer cut its profit forecast. The company now expects pre-tax profit for the year to 31 August to be around £110m. In April, it was still confident of hitting market expectations of £182.6m. The share price fell by nearly 31% to 769p, making it the top loser on the FTSE mid-cap index and taking the company’s market value below £1bn, to around £900m. WH Smith said a financial review had found an overstatement of £30m of expected headline trading profit in North America, and blamed the accelerated recognition of supplier income in the region. North America profits are now estimated to be £25m, rather than £55m. The group has instructed the accounting firm Deloitte to carry out an “independent and comprehensive review”. The 230-year-old British business has just sold its highstreet stores to the investment company Modella Capital, but was forced to cut the sale price by £12m to around £40m after trading at the chain deteriorated. While the high street business, which employs about 5,000 people, will be rebranded as TGJones, WH Smith is retaining its brand for its travel shops in railway stations, airports and hospitals. On the pension theme… Retired women in the UK in effect go four months of the year without a pension when their income is compared with that of men, union leaders have warned. The TUC said the income gap between men and women in retirement was 36.5%, equivalent to a shortfall of £7,600 a year on average. As a percentage this was more than double the gender pay gap, which measures the difference in average earnings from work; it stands at 13.1%. The union organisation said this meant that retired women effectively stopped receiving a pension from 21 August when compared with men, creating a four-month gap. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said the income gap between men and women in retirement should be central to the inquiry by the pensions commission, which the government launched last month. The chancellor will still have to raise taxes in October despite borrowing matching official forecasts, summed up Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He is predicting “sin” and “stealth” tax hikes, duty increases and a pensions tax raid. The big picture remains that the public finances are in chronically weak condition. The chancellor faces surging gilt yields and a likely productivity downgrade from the OBR in the October forecast round. The litany of policy uturns has only compounded the government’s fiscal woes. We think the chancellor will need to resort to ’sin’ and ’stealth’ tax hikes, duty increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged. We expect the bulk of those tax hikes to be backloaded towards the end of the forecast period, minimising any short-term growth implications. But that will buy the Chancellor only precious little time. The public finances are unsustainable in the long-run and delaying action now increases the risks of needing to make sharper adjustments in the future, which would be more disruptive for economic activity. Nabil Taleb, economist at PwC UK, echoed those comments. Although tax receipts rose in July, the chancellor remains under pressure as she tries to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules she has committed to. While the government’s manifesto promises to maintain investment and shield working people from tax hikes, analysis from NIESR suggests up to £40bn in additional revenue may be needed to restore headroom and maintain investor confidence in the UK’s public finances. As the chancellor prepares for the autumn budget, the challenge will be finding creative sources of revenue while treading carefully around the impact on living standards. However, the outlook has not improved much, said Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics. Ultimately, today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the budget later this year. The government’s u-turns on spending cuts and potential upward revisions to the office for Budget Responsibility’s borrowing forecasts mean the chancellor may need to raise £17-27bn at the Autumn Budget to maintain the £9.9bn of headroom against her fiscal mandate. And given that she is struggling to stick to existing spending plans and we doubt the gilt market will tolerate significant increases in borrowing, most of that will have to be funded by tax rises. The ONS said central government tax receipts increased by £14.8bn to £264.7bn in the financial year so far. This included increases of £7.7bn in income tax, £3.2bn in VAT and £2.5bn in corporation tax. Compulsory social contributions increased by £9.5bn to £63.8bn, after changes to the rate of national insurance contributions paid by employers came into effect on 6 April. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK government borrowed £1.1bn last month, the lowest July borrowing for three years, in a boost to the chancellor ahead of her autumn budget. The figure was £2.3bn lower than a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. It was also below economists’ forecasts. Income tax receipts via self assessment totalled £15.5bn, £2.7bn more than in July 2024. So far this financial year, from April to July, borrowing totalled £60bn, £6.7bn higher than in the same period last year, and the third-highest borrowing for the period since records began, after those of 2020 and 2021. It is in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast of £59.9bn for that period. Darren Jones, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: We’re investing in our public services, and modernising the state, to improve outcomes and reduce costs in the medium term. Far too much taxpayer money is spent on interest payments for the longstanding national debt. That’s why we’re driving down government borrowing over the course of the parliament – so working people don’t have to foot the bill and we can invest in better schools, hospitals, and services for working families. The FTSE 100 index managed a record close on Wednesday even though UK inflation came in hotter than expected. The index rose by 1.3%, its strongest daily performance since May, to 9,288, a gain of 98 points. Many Asian stock markets have made modest gains, while Japan’s Nikkei fell by 0.6% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.3%. On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed lower again, by 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.2% and the Dow Jones was flat. The minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting last night showed two governors backed a cut. Policymakers on the federal open market committee (FOMC) worried about the state of the labour market and elevated inflation, but most agreed that it was too soon to cut interest rates. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: Yesterday’s FOMC minutes further dampened investor mood and accelerated the equity selloff – again led by a significant drop across Big Tech. The minutes stated that Fed officials were worried about both weakening jobs data and inflation risks, but that “a majority of participants judged the upside risks to inflation as the greater of these two risks.” That means officials remain inclined to prioritise inflation control by keeping monetary policy tight rather than cutting rates. Yet, one caveat makes the minutes look less hawkish than they first appeared: this meeting was held before the release of the problematic July jobs report – with big downside revisions – that spooked investors and fueled expectations for a September cut. Jerome Powell’s speech tomorrow could therefore strike a middle ground: acknowledging rising concern about the labour market, while underscoring that inflation remains a key risk to be addressed carefully.
