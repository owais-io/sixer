  Alexander Isak is understood to have declined a high-powered invitation to
  return to Newcastle’s first-team fold. The Sweden striker has spent most of
  this summer on a form of strike as he attempts to engineer a move to Liverpool
  by refusing to play for Eddie Howe’s first team or rejoin the squad for
  training. Newcastle’s manager has repeatedly asked Isak to reintegrate as the
  club’s Saudi Arabian owners decide whether to hold the 25‑year‑old forward to
  a £140,000-a-week contract with three years still outstanding or sell him to
  Anfield. On Monday afternoon Jamie Reuben, Newcastle’s minority owner, and
  representatives of the majority owners, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund,
  visited Isak and his representatives in Northumberland and attempted to broker
  a rapprochement. It is understood the forward was offered a lucrative pay rise
  in exchange for a willingness to stay for at least one more season but that
  prospect carried little appeal. This impasse is far from ideal from Howe, who
  needs to replace Isak’s former understudy Callum Wilson, now at West Ham, and
  is running out of time to find a striker to fill the Swede’s boots. Yasir
  al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chair, is in the middle of a rare visit to the
  north-east and would ideally like to keep Isak, but Howe has made clear he
  only wants players who are fully committed and would like a swift resolution
  to a problem that has dominated this summer. In the hours before Newcastle’s
  3-2 home defeat by Liverpool on Monday Rumayyan sanctioned a £50m bid for the
  Wolves centre-forward Jørgen Strand Larsen. Although that offer was swiftly
  rejected it is thought an improved bid will follow and Newcastle are hopeful
  that will be accepted. Wolves continue to insist the Norwegian is not for
  sale. Newcastle have also had a £40m bid for Yoane Wissa rejected. Although
  Brentford do not want to lose Wissa the striker is desperate to join Newcastle
  and a transfer, although complicated, could yet transpire before Monday’s
  deadline. A more readily available option is Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson,
  although he was far from the top of Howe’s original attacking shortlist.
  Liverpool have had a £110m offer for Isak rejected and know they will need to
  up it considerably to have a chance of extracting a player their manager, Arne
  Slot, has long coveted. With Isak making himself unavailable for the Premier
  League trip to Leeds on Saturday and his understudy, the England winger
  Anthony Gordon, beginning a three-game suspension, Howe could start the
  inexperienced Will Osula. Newcastle could also be without the key midfielders
  Sandro Tonali and Joelinton, owing to respective shoulder and groin injuries,
  as well as the concussed central defender Fabian Schär. Wolves are poised to
  complete the signing of the Girona defender Ladislav Krejci. Wolves consider
  Krejci a permanent signing but the Czech Republic centre-back will join on an
  initial loan. Wolves will trigger a £20m permanent move after a number of
  appearances. Krejci joined the La Liga club last year from Sparta Prague,
  where the 26-year-old won two league titles. He becomes Vítor Pereira’s fifth
  summer signing but the Wolves manager still wants to add a midfielder and a
  forward.
