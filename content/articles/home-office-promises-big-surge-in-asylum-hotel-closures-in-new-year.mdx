  The Home Office has promised a “big surge” in asylum hotel closures in the new
  year, with five more to shut in the coming months, as ministers face mounting
  pressure over the government’s record on immigration. Speaking after a weekend
  of protests and counter-protests over the use of hotels to house asylum
  seekers, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the government had
  inherited a “border security system in tatters” and accused opposition parties
  of offering “the fag packet plans without the substance on delivery”. Nigel
  Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme,
  including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the
  detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of
  flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers. The
  Reform UK leader’s plans also include withdrawing from the European convention
  on human rights and replacing the Human Rights Act with a British bill of
  rights prioritising citizens’ rights. Writing for the Telegraph, he described
  international treaties governing human rights law as “malign influences” that
  had been “allowed to frustrate deportations”. “The time has come to put this
  country first,” Farage said. “This is all a question of priorities. Is Keir
  Starmer on the side of the British people, national security and protecting
  women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated international treaties and
  human rights lawyers?” Farage’s intervention comes after a Times poll by
  YouGov found that 71% of voters believe Keir Starmer is handling the asylum
  seeker hotel crisis poorly, including a majority of Labour supporters. The
  findings have intensified pressure on ministers to demonstrate visible
  progress before a winter in which the use of hotels remains one of the most
  politically fraught aspects of the small boats crisis. Eagle, the border
  security and asylum minister, said Reform’s plans were unworkable and accused
  the Conservatives of leaving behind a broken system. “This government
  inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,”
  she said. “Since the election we have been rebuilding the foundations of both,
  saving £1bn in asylum accommodation costs, increasing removals of those with
  no right to be here, and bringing forward new laws to make it easier to deport
  sex offenders, which both Reform and the Tories voted against. “Under the
  Tories we had years of fantasy solutions, which we were told would stop the
  boats, but which simply cost a fortune and had no impact. Reform look to be
  offering more of the same. These are back-of-the-fag packet plans without the
  substance on delivery. “Illegal migration is a complex, global problem
  requiring serious and sustainable policies, including working closely with
  partners overseas. Only the Labour government is offering that kind of plan.”
  A government source said “by the end of the year at least five more hotels are
  expected to be closed, with a big surge in closures in the new year”,
  describing the move as part of a wider effort to end hotel use entirely. The
  number of hotels accommodating asylum seekers has fallen from a peak of 400 in
  2023, when costs reached £9m a day, to just more than 200 now, with a reduced
  daily cost of £5.5m, insiders say. In the first half of this year alone, the
  number of asylum seekers living in hotels fell by 6,000 – a 16% reduction.
  Home Office figures show overall asylum costs have dropped by 11%, delivering
  £1bn in savings last year and a forecast of at least another £1bn to be saved
  next year. Ministers argue the closures show tangible progress, even as
  critics continue to highlight delays in processing claims and challenges in
  securing alternative housing. Rising public anger over asylum accommodation
  has been fuelled by high-profile criminal cases and violent incidents. The
  Scottish Tory leader, Russell Findlay, defended protests outside a hotel
  housing asylum seekers after Sadeq Nikzad, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant, was
  jailed for nine years in June for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in October
  2023. Findlay said: “It’s understandable in those circumstances why
  communities would question the entire integrity and safety of the immigration
  system. As long as that’s being done lawfully and respectfully that is an
  entirely right way to protest.” The fallout from the Epping asylum hotel
  ruling has also escalated tensions. The high court recently ordered the
  removal of asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Essex after local
  Conservative-led councils mounted a legal challenge. The decision has
  emboldened other councils to consider similar action. Kemi Badenoch, leader of
  the Conservatives, is hosting a call on Tuesday with Tory councillors,
  planning law experts and senior party strategists to discuss how councils can
  coordinate further legal challenges. Attenders include Lord Charles Banner KC;
  the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp; James Cleverly, the shadow housing
  secretary; Holly Whitbread, a cabinet member at Epping Forest council; and
  John Cope, the chair of the Conservative councillors’ association. The
  Guardian understands the session will aim to “help and encourage Conservative
  councils to take the lead in fighting to close asylum hotels in their
  constituency” and “give genuine advice based on a serious plan of action”. A
  two-day trial begins on Tuesday at Chelmsford crown court of a man charged
  with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl outside the Bell hotel – a case
  that has fuelled anger locally and sparked fresh protests across Essex.
  Despite highlighting falling costs, declining hotel use and tougher
  enforcement, Labour remains under political pressure. The government has
  pointed to new deals with France, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam and Iraq
  aimed at disrupting trafficking and speeding removals. A UK-France treaty
  signed in July has already led to detentions, insiders say, while the “deport
  now appeal later” scheme has expanded to 23 countries, with 66 charter flights
  removing hundreds, including serious offenders, in the past year.
