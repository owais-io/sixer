  Students burn frontier post Weiler, Franco-German border, 6 August Shouting
  ‘Europe is here!’ students of nine nationalities converged on this frontier
  post from both sides of the border today, smashed down barrier gates and
  burned them in a bonfire as customs officers looked on helplessly. The
  demonstration was organised by the Inter-University Federal Union, an
  international student body supporting the aims of European Union. In their
  well-arranged protest against national barriers, the students approached the
  frontier from both sides, near the forest of Hagenau, where there was bitter
  fighting between the Germans and the Allies in 1945. The frontier guards did
  not interfere, and there were no casualties. While a German youth wielding a
  heavy log smashed the red lamps on the frontier post, students from each side
  of the border picked up the barriers and carried them to the bonfire. The
  students had camped overnight on both sides of the border, those on the French
  side comprising nearly every nationality represented in the Council of Europe
  session now being held in Strasbourg. This afternoon a large party of
  demonstrators drove to the border in a convoy which included several buses
  full of students, two radio reporting vans representing the French and Swiss
  radios, and headed by three motorcyclist scouts. After burning the barricades
  the students held a meeting in a meadow under the green and white flag of the
  European Movement. They carried banners inscribed Europe is Here in various
  languages, and We Demand European Citizenship. Freedom of travel The students’
  declaration said: ‘We demand the establishment of a European passport giving
  freedom of travel throughout Europe, respecting, however, the rights of
  national governments to control immigration.’ ‘For the first time in European
  history Europeans have marched to the frontier, not to fight each other but
  unified in their desire to abolish frontiers. The splitting up of Europe at
  the present time is not only an absurdity but a grave danger.’ M André Philip,
  one of the principal French delegates to the Council of Europe, arrived with
  the French students and made a speech at the bonfire expressing his approval
  of the action taken and promising European youth that he would represent them
  at Strasbourg in their efforts to eliminate European borders. A contingent of
  British students was led by Ernest G Thompson, a physics student, of Trinity
  College, Cambridge, Michael Hart, of Keble College, Oxford, and Frank Mifsud,
  of Oriel College, Oxford.
