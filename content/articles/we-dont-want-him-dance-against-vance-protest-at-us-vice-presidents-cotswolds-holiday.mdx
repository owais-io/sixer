  There was cake and music. The weather was perfect. At first glance, it could
  have been a joyful community gathering in a sun-dappled Cotswolds village
  park, but the placards gave the game away. These pulled no punches,
  criticising the policies and stances championed by the US vice-president, JD
  Vance, who is enjoying a country break down the road. About 100 people, mostly
  women, turned up for the “not welcome” party organised by the Stop Trump
  Coalition on the park opposite the Co-op in Charlbury, north-west Oxfordshire.
  “He’s simply not welcome here,” said Sue Moon, a therapist from nearby
  Chipping Norton, who was carrying a placard reading: “Cotswold childless cat
  ladies say go home” – a reference to Vance’s typically blunt put-down of
  Democrats. Moon – who has children and no cats – said the Cotswolds was
  earning a reputation as a bolt-hole for the rich and powerful; the former
  prime minister David Cameron lives nearby. “That’s not what we’re about. We
  don’t want anything to do with people like him,” she said, referring to Vance.
  Natasha Phillips, who had travelled 70 miles from Bath to attend the event
  billed as a “Dance against Vance”, bore a placard saying: “JD Vance – the guy
  who bullied a war hero from the comfort of his couch.” “The way he treated
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy was disgusting,” she said. “The Ukrainian people are
  heroes. British people admire the way they are standing up to [Vladimir]
  Putin. I wanted to come here to show that.” Chris Tatton, a long-term resident
  of Charlbury and a former councillor, said one of the worst things he had seen
  in a lifetime of watching politics was Vance’s ambush of the Ukrainian
  president. “That was disgraceful,” he said. His friend Steve Akers, a retired
  union organiser, said even worse for him was the sight of starving children in
  Gaza. “That wouldn’t happen without this US government.” One placard said:
  “Make Charlbury great again – go home.” Another said: “Not too posh to
  protest.” A third: “Rolling hills. Not rolling back climate change.” There
  were plenty of versions of the meme of Vance as a bloated baby. In June, a
  Norwegian man, Mads Mikkelsen, 21, accused American border officials of
  denying him entry into the US because he had the meme saved on his phone. More
  wholesomely, a boy with a skateboard wore a T-shirt with a cheerful Canadian
  motif. And the organisers had brought along a Colin the Caterpillar cake with
  an image of Vance’s face attached to it. Rachel, a carer from Banbury,
  Oxfordshire, said: “I’m most worried about his environmental policies. They
  risk eliminating the whole of humanity, all the creatures on the Earth.” Over
  the past few decades, this corner of Oxfordshire has been turned into a
  celeb-magnet – a place of designer delis, gastropubs, spas and private clubs.
  Jeremy Clarkson’s Diddly Squat farm shop and pub attract fans of his TV shows
  and his conservative views (though he called Vance “a bearded God-botherer” in
  a Times column earlier this year). The former Top Gear presenter shared an
  image on Instagram on Tuesday which highlighted that his farm is under a
  no-fly zone. In an apparent reference to filming for the fifth series of his
  series Clarkson’s Farm, the 65-year-old wrote: “On the downside, no drone
  shots today. On the upside, no annoying light aircraft.” Clarkson later
  sarcastically shared a video of a peaceful Cotswolds scene and wrote: “Utter
  chaos caused by Vance. How will we ever manage?” In the interest of political
  balance, Vance’s predecessor as VP, Kamala Harris, was spotted in Charlbury’s
  pub, the Bull, last month. House prices here have soared, making it hard for
  local young people to find a place to live. A modern three-bedroomed house in
  Charlbury will set you back the best part of £500,000. As in rural areas
  across England, services such as health and transport are stretched. Vance
  probably won’t see the issues. He is believed to be staying in an 18th-century
  manor house owned by the lightbulb millionaire Johnny Hornby and his wife,
  Pippa, a London art patron and collector, who are friends of Cameron. Jonathan
  Mazower, the communications director for Survival International, a charity
  that works with Indigenous peoples, did not attend the “party” but was angry
  that Vance had been invited. “There’s massive disruption – all roads and
  footpaths have been closed, all cars are searched, no visitors are allowed in.
  There are police and US Secret Service agents everywhere,” said Mazower, who
  lives near the sprawling digs where Vance is staying. “But more important than
  the disruption is what he represents. On the whole people here are very much
  ‘live and let live’ but this is something else entirely. Trump’s No 2 coming
  here feels like an absolute outrage and imposition. “The massive police and
  Secret Service presence makes any normal protest impossible, so we’ve had to
  resort to putting up placards around the village, some of which are being
  taken down.” Andy Graham, the leader of West Oxfordshire district council,
  compared the scenes to the Will Smith film Men in Black. “Seeing someone
  dressed up with black suit, sunglasses, the whole lot, you kind of felt it was
  a bit over the top really,” he said. “We understand that people do need
  security but I think they haven’t been discreet about it.”
