  Heathrow’s third runway “is going to be empty” if high charges are levied on
  airlines and passengers to foot the bill, the airport’s biggest customer has
  warned. British Airways’ owner, International Airlines Group (IAG), said the
  price paid per passenger could double under plans revealed on Thursday by
  Heathrow to invest almost £50bn in expansion and upgrades, including a £21bn
  third runway and new terminals. The IAG chief executive, Luis Gallego, said:
  “The investment is going to be huge, and with the current regulatory model it
  is going to be very expensive for customers. “If we build a new runway and
  don’t change the model, passengers are going to pay double. We risk a new
  runway that is going to be empty.” Current airport charges are about £25 per
  passenger per flight, capped by the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority,
  which adjudicates in a five-yearly settlement between the airport and
  airlines. Sean Doyle, the chief executive of British Airways (BA), added: “We
  want a model that incentivises delivery of infrastructure efficiently – and we
  don’t think they have that now. The cost of adding capacity has been a lot
  more than elsewhere in the world. “If we want to increase the number of
  passengers, we have to keep it competitive … If growth is at any price, it’s
  not going to happen.” BA operates about half of all Heathrow flights, with its
  IAG sister airlines Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling also flying from the London
  hub. Heathrow submitted “shovel-ready” plans to the government this week for a
  3,500-metre-long runway, which it said it could achieve within a decade, and
  which could grow passenger numbers to 150 million a year. Gallego said BA
  would also work with Arora, who submitted an alternative plan for a shorter
  runway, adding: “It’s good news we have two credible proposals. Competition is
  good to improve things. But any [plan] that is finally selected requires a
  change in the regulatory model.” IAG said customer satisfaction at BA had
  continued to grow despite incidents such as the closure of Heathrow by a
  substation fire, which cost the airline about £40m, and baggage failures at
  the airport. The airline was also one of the most affected by the air traffic
  control failure this week, with a number of flights cancelled and takeoffs
  delayed for an hour because of a radar-related problem at Nats. It did not
  echo Ryanair’s calls for the departure of Nats’ bosses. Gallego said: “We are
  disappointed in the level of disruption and the impact it had on our customers
  at a peak time. And it’s disappointing that the lessons of previous disruption
  were not learned.” He said that the recent large-scale investment in BA’s
  operational resilience meant the airline “could manage the situation in an
  exceptional way”. However, he added: “That said our chief concern for summer
  is still air traffic control. On an ongoing basis, France is our main concern
  with our flights.” Strikes and staffing issues at air traffic control centres
  in Europe have caused widespread disruption, with overflights also affected
  during French strikes. Airlines have called on the EU to intervene. Ryanair
  said on Friday that more than 38,000 flights so far in 2025 had been delayed
  by French ATC. The comments came as IAG reported strong profits for the first
  half of 2025, with operating profits rising 43% year on year to €1.9bn
  (£1.6bn), on revenues that rose 8% to €15.9bn, driven mainly by BA.
  Transatlantic routes remained lucrative, with revenue per seat up 5.2% to
  North America overall, bolstered by premium fares. However, BA reported a
  “softening” and “weakness” in sales of its economy seats from the US. Gallego
  said: “We have seen since the announcement of tariffs volatility in the market
  – the trend is slowly improving but still we see volatility and that situation
  in economy leisure.”
