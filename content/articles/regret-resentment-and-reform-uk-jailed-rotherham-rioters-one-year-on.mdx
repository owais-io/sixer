  It was a scene that became the defining image of the year for many. Flames
  licking up the side of a grey breezeblock hotel with balaclava-clad men
  jostling around, kicking, smashing windows, throwing debris on the fire.
  Protests were not uncommon outside the Holiday Inn in Manvers near Rotherham,
  which housed 200 asylum seekers, but there would be something different about
  Sunday 4 August 2024, coming after the murder of three young girls in
  Southport by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana days earlier. It was not the first
  riot of the weekend instigated by the far right but it would be the biggest
  and it would bring to a close a week of violent clashes between communities
  and with the police. The demonstration was supposed to be peaceful – at least,
  from the point of view of many of those who had gathered there to make a
  stand, as they saw it, against their town becoming a dumping ground for people
  the country did not want or know what to do with. But from the very start it
  was clear there was a contingent who had planned to cause harm, to drive out
  the asylum seekers at any cost, perhaps even to kill them. Later, authorities
  would be reeling from how close the events came to being deadly, with police
  only just gaining control after rioters smashed their way into the hotel. It
  was a “dark day”, according to South Yorkshire police’s assistant chief
  constable, Lindsey Butterfield. Ahead of the first anniversary of the
  violence, the Guardian spoke to a dozen men, aged 20 to 64 at the time, who
  received prison sentences for their part in the riot. Most lived a few miles
  away from the scene and none considered themselves to be racist, though most
  demonstrated a readiness to believe racist lies spread on Facebook about the
  refugees living in their area raping women or children. And they were quick to
  take matters into their own hands, blaming all asylum seekers. Though each of
  the rioters had their own motivations, there was a common theme of mistrust in
  authority and the media. Some said they’d seen Rotherham decline steadily over
  the years. “Everybody’s just fed up aren’t they? You can’t get a dentist, it’s
  hard work,” said one rioter. Reform UK is gaining ground in this part of South
  Yorkshire, with the anti-establishment rhetoric of Nigel Farage having strong
  appeal. Perhaps surprisingly, most were eager to talk, glad to be given the
  opportunity to voice their feelings about unfair sentences and the public
  misunderstanding of the kind of people they were. For some, the violence had
  been a “wake-up call”, with the partner of one rioter saying he had PTSD from
  going to prison and had “completely changed”. He had been on drugs and alcohol
  – there were numerous alcohol monitoring tags among the released men – but “he
  has turned himself around, it was the catalyst that stopped it all”. Wives and
  girlfriends spoke of how tough it had been for them, particularly looking
  after children without the support of their spouse. Christmas had been
  especially challenging for young children with a parent behind bars. “It has
  been the worst experience of my life,” she said. “It was the first time I’ve
  ever known anyone go to prison.” Glyn Guest, a 61-year-old retired window
  cleaner, said he was walking his dog Ollie near the hotel when he was drawn
  in, having not known there was going to be a protest. “I heard a load of
  shouting and bawling and that were it,” he said. He was sentenced to two years
  and eight months for violent disorder after continually walking up to the
  police line and being pushed back – getting his nose broken – and at one point
  grabbing a riot shield. His version of events was that a police officer “lost
  her footing” but the court interpreted the video as him pulling her over,
  which she said had left her “terrified for her safety”. “I didn’t agree with
  them when they were setting fires and that. I thought that were a bit harsh
  like, chucking house bricks and that. I didn’t go down for trouble. “But the
  judge just wouldn’t listen. It was bad. I can’t weigh it up,” he adds, about
  the length of his sentence. He said being locked up was “hard” and he lost a
  lot of weight – his face looked drawn compared with the mugshot taken when he
  handed himself into police. All the men who spoke to the Guardian wanted to
  make it clear they were not far-right – a label that had made prison dangerous
  and terrifying, serving their time alongside gangs of non-white offenders who
  “were after us because a screw grassed us up”. “They were waiting for us, with
  the riot – but it was wrong, they got it all wrong.” Those who were sentenced
  to two or three years served about a third of their sentence before they were
  released on licence, wearing ankle tags that require them to be home between
  the hours of 7pm and 7am. The scene in Manvers last summer – with lines of
  officers pushing back groups of men – was reminiscent of another era, when
  striking miners were subjugated in clashes with police. “I used to work at
  Manvers colliery, half a mile underneath the hotel,” said Mick Woods, who was
  sentenced to two years. “We were on strike for a year and what did British
  people do? Nowt.” Unlike the other rioters, all of whom said they had never
  been to a demonstration before, Woods has spent a good deal of time at
  protests and on picket lines in his 65 years. He cannot tolerate the way
  British people, especially the working class, do not stand up for themselves,
  he said, and is “proud” that he protested. “My conscience is very clear. Very
  clear. The people what don’t go down there [to protest], they are proper
  criminals.” Though Woods appeared to be anti-immigration generally, his
  protest had been against “atrocious terrorist acts” in Southport. He had
  sympathy for the asylum seekers, he said, and had not wanted them to be hurt.
  “I don’t blame people coming here. We’re sticking us nose in people’s
  business, all over the planet,” he said. In footage played in court, he was
  standing next to a man with a dog and told police officers if they hit him,
  the dog would get them. He called an officer a “disgrace to society”. But the
  court agreed there was no physical violence from Woods, nor did he do anything
  to encourage it from anyone else. “I was shouting at the coppers saying, ‘You
  should be ashamed of yersens.’ And I went, ‘You want a bumming by Gary
  Glitter.’” He laughed. He’d been a nuisance, but on any other day his
  behaviour may not have been considered criminal. Others referenced his case as
  an example of a particularly harsh sentence, though he said prison was on his
  “bucket list” and he saw himself as a “political prisoner”. “It wasn’t violent
  disorder, it was threatening behaviour, and I ought to have not admitted to
  it,” he said. Almost all of the men said they felt under pressure from their
  solicitor to plead guilty to violent disorder, a serious offence that
  virtually guaranteed prison time. “Post office workers, they did the same to
  them and some of them took their lives,” said Woods. “You can say this, that
  and t’other, and they’ll make people into summat they’re not, and that’s what
  they did with me.” At least 100 people have been charged by South Yorkshire
  police for the riots and 85 of those have been sentenced to a combined 213
  years in prison. The force is continuing to arrest perpetrators of the
  violence. In reality, for most of those individuals jailed, what they saw as
  harsh treatment only entrenched their beliefs. The father of two rioters who
  were sentenced for throwing objects at police, said he had gone down a
  far-right “rabbit hole” online trying to understand why his sons were
  imprisoned for seemingly minor crimes. He believed his sons received such
  harsh sentences because they were “protesting immigration” and that it was the
  prime minister, “two-tier Keir” Starmer, who was responsible. “It were all
  [the] press that got us in jail,” said Jordan Teal, 35, who was identified
  despite wearing a balaclava, and sentenced to two years and eight months for
  shouting at police that they were “protecting paedophiles” and ripping off
  fence panels that were used as weapons. “I hope you’re proud of yourselves,”
  he said to the Guardian. In fact, South Yorkshire police had its own evidence
  gatherers, officers deployed with videocameras, as well as bodycam and aerial
  footage taken from two helicopters. Largely, though, it was the hundreds of
  hours of footage posted on social media by the rioters themselves that got
  them convicted. Joel Goodman, a photojournalist, refused to hand over any
  photos from the Rotherham riot, despite legal threats from South Yorkshire
  police. Michael Shaw, now 27, has the footage on his phone of the kick against
  a riot shield that was part of a clash that landed him two years and six
  months. “They absolutely battered me that day, did the coppers.” Under the
  helmets and body armour, and behind the polycarbonate shields on one of the
  warmest days of the year, there would not be a lot of patience for those who
  did not do as they were told. A former soldier from the Yorkshire regiment,
  Shaw had gone “with no mask or gloves or anything”, there was “no intent” he
  said. Like others, he said: “I’m not racist, I just don’t like it when people
  are raping women and children. It would be exactly the same if it were white
  lads.” He left the riot as the hotel was set on fire – did he feel bad for the
  asylum seekers trapped inside the hotel? “No comment.” It was clear, he said,
  the big sentences handed down for Rotherham and the other riots a year ago
  hadn’t worked as a deterrent: “Just look what’s happening now in Epping.” So
  would he do it again? “One man’s not going to make a difference. I wish I’d
  have stayed in bed.”
