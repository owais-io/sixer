  Sky Sports is to give its viewers the opportunity to watch four Premier League
  games at once this season, introducing a “multiview” feature to accompany a
  record number of live matches in the top flight. The initiative, which echoes
  the NFL’s RedZone where coverage shifts to where the action is, forms part of
  an expanded offering by Sky as the broadcaster seeks to hold off the
  challenges of piracy and adapt to a changing media environment. Multiview will
  be used when Sky has the rights to show as many as five games at a time. This
  will mostly be on Sundays as a result of rescheduling for Thursday European
  fixtures. With one main match and three smaller screens lined up alongside,
  one commentary team will move across all the games. Each of the matches will
  also be broadcast individually on different channels. The format may also be
  used for coverage of the Women’s Super League this season. Sky’s director of
  football, Gary Hughes, said the service would offer viewers more choice. “The
  question for us has been how can we enhance what we’ve got? And how can we
  utilise the new rights?” he said. “Having four simultaneous games, we might
  even have five on some midweeks, means it’s just the best way we can offer the
  best use of the assets that we’ve got. There could be some chaos to it, but
  that’s the beauty of having all those games at once.” The broadcaster also
  announced it had recruited Mark Chapman as a presenter for its league
  coverage, with Chapman joining Kelly Cates in working for both Sky and the
  BBC’s Match of the Day this season. There will also be a new analysis show on
  Sunday nights, presented by Jamie Carragher, and a wide-ranging reboot of Sky
  Sports News which will bring the return of the formerly cancelled shows Goals
  on Sunday and the Sunday Supplement. Roman Kemp will host a show on the
  channel on Friday evenings. Sky will show a minimum of 215 live Premier League
  matches this season as it enters the first of a new four-year £6.7bn rights
  deal. It comes into effect amid a decline in the value of sports rights across
  Europe, and ubiquitous online piracy. The company reported a doubling of
  financial losses in its most recent accounts, but Jonathan Licht, Sky’s chief
  sports officer, said Sky Sports was a “growth business”, with record audiences
  recorded in April when Rory McIlroy won the Masters. He said new developments
  in its programming would give non-subscribers a chance to “reappraise” the
  brand. Licht called on tech companies, who are increasingly interested in
  sports rights, to “get the right side” of the issue of piracy. “I think it’s
  everyone’s responsibility,” he said. “I think we certainly look at big tech to
  take that on and we look at the government to help. There is a feeling that if
  certain players were minded to do more, they could do more. If these players
  are going to want to be global sports players, they’re going to have to try
  and get the right side of piracy. It is a serious issue, it’s value
  destructive so we take it seriously.”
