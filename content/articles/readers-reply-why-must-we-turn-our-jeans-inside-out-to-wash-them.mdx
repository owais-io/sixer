  Why does my wife make me turn my jeans inside out before they go in the wash?
  She doesn’t know either. Paul Williams, Argyll Send new questions to
  nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply She’s secretly ashamed that they aren’t
  Levi’s, and doesn’t want the neighbours realising that you buy perfectly
  decent jeans from lesser known labels. Arcanics As someone with dyslexia, I
  have always considered Levi’s to be the king. leswilson I do it to stop the
  tissue I left in my pocket from disintegrating and ruining everything else in
  the wash. EddieChorepost Why not just remove the tissue? gmghouston Have you
  ever tried to wash a tissue by hand? EddieChorepost Washing jeans inside out
  is something I only started doing recently. The reason is simple: they dry
  quicker because the pockets no longer form big wads of wet cloth trapped
  inside. This may not be the original reason behind the practice, but it
  definitely works. Mat Hall In Malaysia, I learned to turn washing inside out
  to dry so that the hot sun could really get to any damp-loving bugs lurking in
  the thicker seams. ChristoWainhope So that they are ready for ironing.
  TryingToBeRational Who the hell irons jeans? Sdc1000 Who the hell irons
  anything these days? Non-iron clothes look fine, especially now I’m retired
  and don’t need to meet customers. I do recall visiting someone with my mother;
  the lady of the house was doing the ironing and started on a batch of
  underwear. Even my mother thought that a bit extreme. canyoudoso I always
  assumed it was to stop rivets, zips etc from rubbing against or catching on
  other garments. I certainly find that zips stay done up more if the puller is
  on the inside of the garment. It’s definitely nothing to do with ironing,
  because I avoid ironing at all possible opportunities. EBGB Denim is yarn dyed
  in such a way that the colour is only on the surface of the yarn. The dye
  particles are vulnerable to abrasion, which is why the fabric goes white at
  the stress points, where the original colour of the yarn starts to show
  through. Washing inside out reduces the chance of abrasion against the drum of
  the machine and premature fading. rigoletto Jeans are about the only garment I
  don’t wash inside out. The idea is that the lack of abrasion against the
  machine and other clothes means the colour holds better and the garment looks
  less worn; this is usually the case and why shirts (usually made from heavier
  fabrics) look darker on the inside. It’s also wise for anything with printed
  or applied designs, T-shirts in particular – unless, like me, you prefer
  workwear to look worn and faded. orso
