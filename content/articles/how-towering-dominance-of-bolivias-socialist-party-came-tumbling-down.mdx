  Amid the almost monochrome landscape of bare-brick buildings in the
  high-altitude Bolivian city of El Alto, taller structures painted in garish
  colours and mirrored glass stand out, topped with giant statues of pop culture
  figures such as Batman and Iron Man. The extravagant structures are known as
  “cholets”, a blend of chalet and cholo, the term used for people of Indigenous
  roots who moved to urban areas while retaining their cultural traits. These
  buildings once symbolised the rise of a new Aymara bourgeoisie that emerged
  during the commodities boom that fuelled the natural gas exports in the early
  years of Bolivia’s first Indigenous president, Evo Morales. Now, however, they
  have become a symbol of how the leftist Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas) lost
  support among its base – and has gone from hegemony to the brink of
  obliteration. After nearly 20 years of Mas government, the party’s
  presidential candidate won just 3.16% of the vote in Sunday’s election – only
  a whisker above the 3% threshold set by the electoral court for a party to
  remain eligible. Bolivia now faces a runoff vote in October between two
  rightwing candidates: the senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and former president
  Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga. Meanwhile, after winning two-thirds of Congress in past
  elections, preliminary estimates suggest Mas will now have only one member of
  the lower house and no senators. “I voted for Mas in the past, but this time I
  chose the right,” said Ronnyxh Oliver Mamani Figueredo, 34, an Aymara
  carpenter and pharmacy owner who has a seven-storey, Knights of the
  Zodiac-themed cholet that cost more than $1m. Figueredo is still repaying the
  construction loans, but amid Bolivia’s worst economic crisis in four decades,
  he has been forced to cut the rental price of the building’s 400-capacity
  event hall from 5,000 bolivianos (£540) to 2,500 (£270). He voted for the
  centre-right business tycoon Samuel Doria Medina, who ended up in third place.
  “The majority of cholet owners I speak to no longer support Mas,” said
  Figueredo. A similar impression comes from Ramiro Sirpa, 47, a sought-after
  sculptor of the giant fibreglass statues that adorn the fronts of the cholets
  and cost between 25,000 and 60,000 bolivianos. “The cholet owners tell me that
  at the start of Mas’s government, they were doing well, but in recent times it
  has been total disappointment,” he said. Gonzalo Chávez Álvarez said that,
  even though they were seen as Mas’s natural constituency, many Indigenous
  businessmen were never socialists. “They always followed a popular, cutthroat
  capitalism,” he said. “Once Mas began to get in the way of business, the
  support evaporated.” While analysts recognise the many social advances that
  took place under Mas, they say the causes of the party’s decline are
  wide-ranging and have gathered momentum over the years – particularly after
  Bolivia’s natural gas reserves dwindled in the final years of Morales’s
  presidency. A common criticism is that the party failed to use the energy boom
  years to invest in other sectors, instead spending on controversial projects
  such as the new presidential palace, which cost $34m in 2018. Public trust was
  eroded by a string of corruption scandals, environmentally controversial
  projects, authoritarian-style control – and above all, the recent deep
  economic crisis of fuel and dollar shortages and soaring inflation. “Mas has
  been knocked out,” said the political analyst Daniel Valverde. “But it was the
  obstinate fratricidal war between Morales and [outgoing] President Luis Arce
  that destroyed them,” he added. Morales sought a fourth term that was widely
  seen as unconstitutional in 2019. On election night, he was ahead but not by
  enough to win outright; after a blackout, the resumed count showed him as the
  winner. The country erupted in violent protests, he resigned and fled the
  country. A new election was held in 2020. Morales’s former finance minister,
  Arce, was chosen to stand for Mas and won. Morales returned, but soon fell out
  with Arce after failing to wield the influence he wanted. The party split, and
  by 2023 the rupture was clear when Morales announced plans to run in this
  year’s elections; Arce blocked him and seized control of Mas. In the meantime,
  a case that had surfaced during the 2019 campaign re-emerged: Morales was
  accused of fathering a child with a 15-year-old girl – an act that, under
  Bolivian law, constitutes statutory rape. A prosecutor reopened the case in
  2024 and issued an arrest warrant for Morales, who has since remained in the
  coca-growing Chapare region, shielded by hundreds of growers preventing his
  detention. Asked last week why police had not enforced the warrant, Arce told
  the Guardian: “If the Bolivian police go ahead with the arrest, how many
  Bolivians will die? Is it worth many others dying for one person?” Barred from
  running under another party by constitutional and electoral court rulings,
  Morales called on his supporters to cast blank votes, which ended up far
  higher than the historic average of under 5%, reaching 19%. In Cochabamba,
  where the Chapare is located, blank votes reached 32.8%, more than those cast
  for Paz Pereira, who received 28.6%. But in other regions where Mas had also
  historically prevailed, such as El Alto, Paz Pereira, a senator and the son of
  a former president, came out on top. “Paz Pereira was the only candidate who
  reached out to deep Bolivia – artisans, small business owners, farmers,
  transport workers – and who tried to forge alliances with popular sectors,”
  said analyst Valverde, noting that in the past it was Mas that managed to
  connect with these groups. “Mas risks disappearing if it doesn’t reinvent
  itself and make the mea culpa it has long resisted,” he added.
