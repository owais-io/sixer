  The story of Sherman’s march to the sea is often remembered for its
  destruction of the south. Led by the Union general William Tecumseh Sherman
  through Georgia from 15 November until 21 December 1864, the march began with
  Union forces taking Atlanta, and ended when they took the port of Savannah.
  Sherman instructed his forces to follow a “scorched earth” policy, which was
  intended to break the civilian population’s support for the Confederacy. White
  southerners supported the Confederacy through providing food, railroads and
  other goods. Sherman’s soldiers destroyed everything from military targets to
  civilian property, raiding farms and plantations and stealing goods. But the
  version of the march that was popularized in the book and film Gone With the
  Wind doesn’t tell the full, or even a partially accurate, story, despite it
  being perhaps the most prominent understanding in the American zeitgeist of
  Sherman’s actions. Gone With the Wind perpetuated a narrative in which “the
  skies rained death” on Sherman’s arrival, though Sherman did not burn Atlanta
  to the ground: much of the city’s destruction was from entrenchments dug by
  Confederates and the detonation of ammunition as they fled. In the common
  understanding of the march, enslaved people are an afterthought, affected by
  Sherman’s actions by happenstance and largely rendered voiceless and without
  agency. But the historian Bennett Parten is adding to that notion. “It’s the
  moment where ideas of American freedom came into collision,” Parten said of
  the march. “It was always being re-imagined. I think as Americans, continually
  questioning and querying what American freedom actually means is a really good
  practice.” In his latest book, Somewhere Toward Freedom, Parten, an assistant
  professor of history at Georgia Southern University, seeks to add to the
  common understanding of Sherman’s march by presenting it as an emancipatory
  movement led by formerly enslaved people. “We have certain assumptions about
  what claiming freedom or certain ideas about what freedom should look like,
  but we should also recognize that for enslaved people, claiming freedom with
  your feet, following the army to try to find and reconstitute it into family,
  searching for a sense of security – this was all some form of pursuing freedom
  for themselves,” Parten said. “Offering this new perspective, and by shifting
  the focus on to enslaved people, free people in their experiences, offers a
  version of the march for a whole new generation of Americans to really
  understand what this moment was and to come to a new understanding of what the
  civil war was about and what it looked like as a conflict.” For many enslaved
  people, the march meant freedom, not just the destructive path of Sherman’s
  forces. Much of how the war exists in the zeitgeist currently focuses on how
  soldiers or southern planters viewed the war, but Parten aims to center
  enslaved people, who used the moment to seize their freedom. His book makes
  the newly freed people’s experience its sole focus, and argues that they are
  pivotal to understanding the true impact of the march. “We can include others
  in this dynamic as well – the war becomes so much more multidimensional, it
  becomes so much more local, so much more personalized,” he said. “I really
  hope readers come away with a different understanding of what the wartime
  experience might have been like. I want readers to understand just how central
  enslaved people were to the actual fighting.” Enslaved people were “agents of
  their own story ,Parten said, and they worked to aid the Union army. They
  acted as scouts, intelligence agents and in other capacities to ensure a Union
  victory. “I want readers to, when they approach the civil war, be able to see
  and identify the presence and the, in many cases, paramount importance of the
  role that enslaved people played in shaping the story of the civil war and
  shaping its outcome,” he said. A moment of jubilee Somewhere Toward Freedom
  opens with the story of Sally, a formerly enslaved woman who spent each night
  searching the Union army camps for her children. Her ritual of searching the
  faces of freed people who had joined the army became known and expected
  throughout the camps, though many doubted that Sally would be successful in
  her efforts. Just as Sally and Ben, her husband, had joined the Union army on
  their march and used that opportunity to find their long-ago stolen children,
  other enslaved people used the moment to free themselves and make decisions
  about their lives. It was neither Sherman nor his soldiers’ intention to make
  the march into a liberation event – that was something enslaved people did
  themselves. As Sherman and his 60,000 soldiers marched from Atlanta to
  Savannah, they were joined by enslaved people who seized the moment presented
  to them. “From the very start and at every stop along the way, enslaved people
  fled plantations and rushed into the army’s path … The movement was unlike
  anything anyone had ever seen,” the text reads. “Soldiers described it as
  being practically providential. Enslaved people did, too. They hailed the
  soldiers as angels of the Lord and celebrated the army’s arrival as if it were
  the start of something prophetic, as if God himself had ordained the war and
  the days of Revelation had arrived.” Notions of freedom and jubilee were
  popular from a religious and social standpoint at the time. People were swept
  up in the mood, rooted in what Parten said was a radical moment of social
  renewal and regeneration. Per Leviticus in the Bible, he said, jubilee was a
  time in which debts were absolved, slaves went free, land holdings were
  divided up into equitable plots. Over time, however, labor radicals clung to
  the term as a demand for the absolution of debts. It began to develop an
  apocalyptic edge, as people saw universal freedom and emancipation as a
  harbinger of the coming of Christ. “It has all these competing, different
  elements, but fundamentally what’s at the bottom of it is this really radical
  idea of society renewing itself in a way that is rooted to equity and
  justice,” Parten said of jubilee. “Certainly, by the time that the war
  happens, it’s used in all different types of contexts, but we should recognize
  that when enslaved people or others claim this idea, that’s what they’re
  claiming. We should recognize that there is a need for some form of
  regeneration and renewal at times.” The Union army was reluctant to have the
  mass of formerly enslaved people that joined them, Parten notes in the book.
  Many people came fleeing plantations with only what they had on their backs,
  seizing the opportunity to be free and figuring out what tomorrow would bring
  when it came. Parten describes the camps of formerly enslaved people that
  attached themselves to the Union army as “refugee camps”, and describes the
  way in which even the Union army responded to them as a “refugee crisis”. The
  formerly enslaved people, who had self-emancipated, endured harsh elements,
  often without food or shelter, and marched up to 20 miles (32km) a day.
  Despite racism from Union commanders, some of whom attempted to prevent them
  from staying with the army, they persisted. “The reason I use the term
  ‘crisis’ is simply because the presence of so many individuals forces the
  government or the army to recognize them and to begin taking actions to deal
  with these large numbers of people,” Parten said. “The outcome is somewhat of
  a modern refugee story, whether or not that’s how the army viewed them.”
  Parten said that the scale and size of the moment was remarkable to him while
  he was researching the book. By the time Sherman arrived in Savannah at the
  end of his march, Parten estimates, the number of refugees was about 20,000 –
  about the size of Savannah itself. There, Sherman met with Black religious
  leaders. He asked Garrison Frazier, who was the spokesperson for the
  ministers, about how the refugees decided to do what they did. While Frazier
  himself wasn’t a refugee, he had been talking to those who were. In a way, he
  was able to act as a proxy for them, sharing their experiences with someone
  who had the power to enact change for them. “For me, this was such a
  remarkable little nugget of what you find in the sources, because it suggests
  that the refugees, who, through the collective weight and power of their
  movement, found a way to essentially be in the room,” Parten said. “They’re
  not [physically] in the room, but they’re nonetheless really doing things to
  change the policy of the army, the US government, and to have a presence in
  this meeting with Sherman and [Edwin] Stanton [Lincoln’s secretary of war],
  who were two of the most powerful men in the country … [It] really spoke to
  the power of the refugees to really lay claim on this moment and what it might
  mean.” In making formerly enslaved people the sole focus of the story, Parten
  encourages readers to reconsider their understanding of Sherman’s march, its
  implications and its legacy. Thoroughly researched yet written in a
  compelling, accessible way, the book offers a fresh perspective on a
  centuries-old event.
