  That’s the end of a busy and long night; Jose Mourinho’s premature celebration
  feels an age ago. Thanks for your company throughout. Goodnight. A famous
  night for Bromley! Ali Al Hamadi’s penalty was saved by Sam Long, allowing
  Marcus Ifill to step forward and batter the winning kick into the corner.
  Scenes! Latest: Bromley 1-1 Ipswich (4-4 pens) Both teams have scored four out
  of five, so it’s going to sudden death. Another dramatic twist at The
  Hawthorns. Joe Ward’s 96th-minute equaliser was Derby’s only shot on target
  all game, but they prevailed in the resulting penalty competition. Stoke are
  also through after beating Walsall 4-3 on penalties. That leaves just one more
  penalty competition, Bromley v Ipswich. Full time: Bromley 1-1 Ipswich
  Monsieur, with all these penalty competitions you’re really spoiling us. A
  perfect set of penalties from Wrexham, who are through after a remarkable
  comeback. They were 3-1 down going into added time; then Ollie Palmer scored
  twice in 70 seconds to take the tie to penalties. Rotherham have beaten
  Salford 3-2 on penalties after a 0-0 draw. It looks like Bromley v Ipswich,
  which has just gone into injury time, is also heading for penalties. And these
  games have gone to penalties Gillingham 1-1 AFC Wimbledon Salford 0-0
  Rotherham West Brom 1-1 Derby Wrexham 3-3 Hull Carabao Cup results (7.45pm
  kick-offs) Accrington 2-1 Peterborough Blackburn 1-2 Bradford Blackpool 0-1

  Harrogate 1-3 Lincoln Oxford 1-0 Colchester Plymouth 3-2 QPR (from 2-0 down at
  half-time) Portsmouth 1-2 Reading Watford 1-2 Norwich Wigan 1-0 Notts County
  GOAL! West Brom 1-1 Derby (Ward 90+6) An outrageous free-kick from Joe Ward,
  almost on the touchline, has earned Derby a penalty shootout at The Hawthorns.
  Who writes Ollie Palmer’s scripts? He has just headed his second goal in the
  space of 70 seconds to equalise for Wrexham! 77 min: Bromley 1-1 Ipswich
  George Hirst’s close-range shot is crucially deflected over the bar by a
  Bromley defender. They’re 13 minutes plus added time from a penalty
  competition. Meanwhile, Ollie Palmer’s superb header in the first minute of
  injury time has given Wrexham a sniff against Hull: they trail 3-2. Champions
  League latest Benfica are cruising into a playoff against Fenerbahce. With 20
  minutes remaining in Lisbon they lead 2-0 on the night, 4-0 on aggregate.
  Carabao Cup results (7pm/7.15pm kick-offs) Swansea 3-1 Crawley Barrow 0-1
  Preston Middlesbrough 0-4 Doncaster Newport 0-1 Millwall Stockport 3-1 Crewe
  GOAL! Wrexham 1-3 Hull (Crooks 81) The substitute Matt Crooks taps into an
  empty net from a yard to extend Hull’s lead! GOAL! Plymouth 3-2 QPR (Oseni 78)
  Plymouth, who were 2-0 down at half-time, have just taken the lead thanks to
  Owen Oseni’s second goal of the night. The first, a flying volley with the
  wrong foot, is worth looking up on the old socials. Some result, that. Robbie
  Gotts drags a precise long-range shot past Tom Glover to complete a memorable
  victory for Doncaster! Hull have come from behind to lead at Wrexham. Joel
  Ndala, the teenager on loan from Manchester City, ran onto an inviting low
  cross and did the necessary to put Hull in front. GOAL! West Brom 1-0 Derby
  (Heggebo 67) Aune Selland Heggebo taps in from close range to give West Brom a
  deserved lead. Make that two shots on target, and more importantly one goal.
  It was classic Ipswich, all the way from back to front, the ball never leaving
  the floor. Conor Chaplin smashed a shot against the bar and Ben Johnson calmly
  finished the rebound. 52 min: Bromley 1-0 Ipswich It’s been a frustrating
  night for Ipswich so far. As you’d expected they’ve dominated possession – 71
  per cent last time I checked – but have managed only one shot on target.
  Donnarumma dropped from PSG squad for Super Cup GOAL! Coventry 1-0 Luton
  (Simms 57) Seconds after Sky Sports’ Clinton Morrison said the game might as
  well go to penalties now, Ellis Simms gives Coventry the lead in the 1988-89
  clash at the CBS Arena. 54 min: Wrexham 1-1 Hull Ryan Hardie has missed a
  terrific chance for Wrexham, heading wide from barely six yards. Mateus
  Fernandes has put Southampton ahead at Northampton. Which is another way of
  saying that the second halves are under way in the 7.45pm games. It was a
  cracking finish from Fernandes, slammed into the roof of the net after he
  dummied a defender. Bromley have taken a surprise lead on the stroke of
  half-time. A corner was nodded back across goal and headed in by Deji Elerewe.
  Carabao Cup latest (selected games, 7.45pm KOs unless stated) Middlesbrough

  Brom 0-0 Derby Wrexham 1-1 Hull Bromley 0-0 Ipswich (8pm) GOAL! Benfica 2-0
  Nice (agg: 4-0; Schjelderup 27) We’re done here. Benfica will play Fenerbahce
  in the Champions League playoff round. The first leg is in Istanbul a week
  tomorrow with the return in Lisbon on Wednesday 27th. Gianluigi Donnarumma has
  said farewell to the Paris Saint-Germain fans on social media, apparently, so
  he really could be coming to a Premier League ground near you soon. Champions
  League full time: Club Brugge 3-2 Salzburg (agg: 4-2) Brugge are through to
  face Rangers for a place in the Champions League. The first leg is in Glasgow
  a week tonight, the second in feckin Bruges eight days later. GOAL! Portsmouth
  0-2 Reading (Ehibhatiomhan 38) I say! Kelvin Ehibhatiomhan has doubled
  Reading’s lead at Fratton Park. A lovely finish too, passed nonchalantly into
  the net. Carabao Cup goal action Oli McBurnie has equalised for Hull at
  Wrexham. And Andre Garcia, aged 17, has put Reading ahead against the run of
  play at Portsmouth. You can get all the latest on our live scores page. And
  Rangers will meet Club Brugge next week. Hans Vanaken’s 94th-minute goal has
  put them 3-2 up against Salzburg on the night, 4-2 on aggregate. Benfica are
  on course to meet Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in a mouthwatering playoff tie.
  Fredrik Aursnes has extended their aggregate lead. GOAL! Wrexham 1-0 Hull (Lee
  31) Elliot Lee has given Wrexham the lead with the help of a big deflection.
  88 min: Club Brugge 2-2 Salzburg (agg: 3-2) A goal from Carlos Forbs, who was
  on loan at Wolves last season, has put Club Brugge ahead in a ding-dong tie.
  Brugge won the away leg 1-0, Salzburg went 2-0 up in Belgium, then Brugge
  scored twice to take the lead in the tie. If they hold on, they’ll play
  Rangers in the playoff. La Liga A bit of news from Spain, where Real Madrid
  and Barcelona are having another row. 39 min: Middlesbrough 0-2 Doncaster A
  surprise is on the cards at the Riverside, where League One Doncaster have
  continued their excellent start to the season. They lead Middlesbrough 2-0
  through goals from Ben Close and Damola Ajayi. Champions League qualifying
  latest Club Brugge 1-2 Salzburg (6.30pm; agg: 2-2) Ferencvaros 1-0 Ludogorets
  (7.15pm; agg: 1-0) Slovan Bratislava 1-0 Kairat Almaty (7.15pm; agg: 1-1)

  League results Qarabag 5-1 Shkendija (agg: 6-1) FC Copenhagen 5-0 Malmo FF
  (agg: 5-0) Fenerbahce 5-2 Feyenoord (agg: 6-4) Pafos 2-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg:
  3-0) Plzen 2-1 Rangers (agg: 2-4) A superb fightback from Jose Mourinho’s
  Fenerbahce, who were 3-1 down on aggregate shortly before half-time. They will
  meet Benfica or Nice in the playoff round. Rangers will meet Club Brugge or
  Salzburg for a place in the Champions League proper. They won’t be thrilled to
  have lost tonight, but they did the hard yards by winning the first leg 3-0.
  10 min: Northampton 0-0 Southampton “Nothing really drives relegation home
  like cup football in bloody August,” says Rachel Clifton, who may or may not
  be a Southampton fan. Jose’s great entertainers are home and hosed thanks to a
  precise finish from the substitute Talisca. Carabao Cup latest Bradford are
  2-0 up away to Blackburn inside four minutes. I say! 90 min: Fenerbahce 4-2
  Feyenoord (agg; 5-4) Six minutes of added time to play. We’re not done yet.
  The centre-half Tsuyoshi Watanabe smashes a volley into the net for his second
  goal of the night; Feyenoord need one more to take the tie to extra-time.
  Svetozar Markovic restores Plzen’s lead on the night. Nothing for Rangers to
  worry about at this stage, but there will be if Plzen get another quick goal.
  Fenerbahce were inviting pressure. Youssef En-Nesyri has finished off a
  terrific counter-attack to make it 4-1 on the night, 5-3 on aggregate. That’s
  a helluva comeback from Jose Mourinho’s side, who could have lost the head
  when they conceded in strange circumstances just before half-time. 80 min:
  Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) A terrible touch from Ueda, put through on
  goal, allows the Fenerbahce keeper Egribayat to make a brave save. But
  Fenerbahce are inviting pressure. Champions League qualifying latest (6pm KOs
  unless stated) Qarabag 5-1 Shkendija (FT; agg: 6-1) FC Copenhagen 5-0 Malmo FF
  (agg: 5-0) Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Pafos 2-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg:
  3-0) Plzen 1-1 Rangers (agg: 1-4) Club Brugge 0-2 Salzburg (6.30pm; agg: 1-2)
  Ferencvaros 0-0 Ludogorets (7.15pm; agg: 0-0) Slovan Bratislava 0-0 Kairat
  Almaty (7.15pm; agg: 0-1) 76 min: FC Copenhagen 5-0 Malmo FF (agg: 5-0)
  Copenhagen are taking Malmo to the cleaners in the Scandinavian battle. Magnus
  Mattson and Robert, who also scored in the first half, have put them 5-0 in
  front. 75 min: Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Feyenoord sub Borges is
  booked for a late tackle, which leads to a brief bit of posturing from various
  players. I hate to shock you, but this might not finish 11 v 11. 72 min:
  Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Fenerbahce still lead but it’s getting
  tense, and very niggly on the touchline as well. That should be enough for
  Rangers. Lyall Cameron, signed from Dundee in the summer, has scored his first
  goal for the club to restore their three-goal lead. Champions League
  qualifying latest (6pm KOs unless stated) Qarabag 5-1 Shkendija (FT; agg: 6-1)
  FC Copenhagen 3-0 Malmo FF (agg: 3-0) Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3)
  Pafos 2-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg: 3-0) Plzen 1-0 Rangers (agg: 1-3) Club Brugge 0-2
  Salzburg (6.30pm; agg: 1-2) 57 min: Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3)
  Excluding added time, Fenerbahce have scored three goals in 12 minutes to turn
  the tie around. A reminder that the winners will play Benfica or Nice for a
  place in the competition proper. Last season’s inaugural league stage was fun
  but imagine Jose cutting a swathe through the thing. A sensational goal from
  Fred has put Fenerbahce ahead in the tie. Archie Brown did very well to win
  possession 30 yards from the Feyenoord goal, allowing Fred to collect the
  loose ball and curl a majestic shot into the top corner. Mohamed Elyounoussi
  has put Copenhagen 3-0 up against Malmo, both on the night and on aggregate.
  And in Belgium, Salzburg now lead 2-0 on the night, 2-1 on aggregate, thanks
  to Edmund Baidoo. 49 min: Fenerbahce 2-1 Feyenoord (agg: 3-3) A mistake from
  Amrabat allows the Feyenoord substitute Borges to run through on goal. He
  curls a shot across goal and Egribayat thrusts out his left leg to make a
  vital save. Carabao Cup latest Ronald has scored the first goal of the night
  in the Carabao Cup, putting Swansea ahead at home to Crawley after four
  minutes. That’s the only 7pm kick-off. The full fixture list is on our live
  scores page. Meanwhile, in the Guardian’s award-winning property section FC
  Copenhagen 2-0 Malmo FF (agg: 2-0) Fenerbahce 2-1 Feyenoord (agg: 3-3) Pafos
  1-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg: 2-0) Plzen 1-0 Rangers (agg: 1-3) Qarabag thrashed
  Shkendija 5-1 (agg: 6-1) in the early game. And in a match that kicked off at
  6.30pm, Salzburg are 1-0 up (agg: 1-1) away to Club Brugge. The winners of
  that tie will play Plzen or Rangers. Confused? Of course you are. Now all I
  need are the three digits on the back of the card. Rangers aren’t through just
  yet – Rafiu Durosinmi had put Plzen ahead on the night in the Czech Republic.
  The tie is all square after a terrific finish from Jhon Duran! A long ball was
  headed down expertly by En-Nesyri towards the onrushing Duran, who got to the
  ball a split-second before the defender and then, while still off-balance,
  flipped a shot into the far corner. Excellent goal. GOALS! FC Copenhagen 2-0
  Malmo FF (agg: 2-0; Huescas 31, Robert 43) With all the excitement in Istanbul
  I missed not one but two goals for FC Copenhagen. Rodrigo Huescas and Robert
  (no relation) have put them in control of the tie. Fenerbahce needed a quick
  reply. It has come from the Englishman Archie Brown, who got between two
  defenders at the near post to head a left-wing corner into the net. Tsuyoshi
  Watanabe heads Feyenoord in front on the night! It was a terrific header – but
  Fenerbahce are not happy with the manner of the goal. Their keeper Irfan
  picked the ball well outside his area, thinking a free-kick had been given for
  handball against Ueda. It hadn’t, so the referee gave a free-kick to Feyenoord
  for the handball. Hwang clipped it in and Watanabe forced a header past Irfan
  at the near post. 38 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord Ayase Ueda has a shot saved
  after manufacturing space where there appeared to be none in the Fenerbahce
  area. The referee then gave a foul to Fener but I’m not sure whether that was
  before or after Ueda’s dizzying piece of skill. 31 min: Fenerbahce 0-0
  Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Amrabat runs through on goal from halfway, but his touch
  is slightly heavy and Watanabe comes across. He then plays a backpass that
  beats the keeper Wellenreuther and rolls just wide of goal. Actually I think
  Wellenreuther got a slight touch, without which there would probably have been
  a comedy own-goal. 31 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) We’ve now seen
  the offside lines for the disallowed goal; essential En-Nesyri’s knee was
  offside, but it was really close and you can understand why Mourinho was so
  expectant. The celebration might have been pushing it though. 29 min:
  Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Jose Mourinho has started celebrating the
  goal… but now VAR have upheld the offside decision! Comedy gold in Istanbul.
  Mourinho is marching round with the face of a man who has just been told red
  is blue and blue is wibble. He’d seen a replay, judged it to be onside with
  the naked eye and started raising his fists triumphantly to the home fans.
  Then somebody gave him the bad news. 28 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg:
  1-2) Youssef En Nesyri has had a goal disallowed for offside – but it’s being
  checked and looks very tight. 25 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Jhon
  Duran has two attempts at goal in the space of five seconds. The first was
  blocked by a defender; the second took a deflection and was clawed behind by
  the keeper Timon Wellenreuther. Good save. If transfers are your jam, here’s
  the latest on the Premier League’s most wanted. 22 min: Plzen 0-0 Rangers
  (agg: 0-3) So far so good for Rangers in the Czech Republic. The winner of the
  tie will meet Club Brugge or Salzburg in the final playoff round. 15 min:
  Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Jhon Duran – the very same – has just hit
  the side netting with Fener’s first half-chance. Feyenoord have probably
  played the more intricate football but Fenerbahce look a threat on the break.
  Champions League qualifying latest (6pm KOs unless stated) Qarabag 4-1
  Shkendija (5pm, agg: 5-1) FC Copenhagen 0-0 Malmo FF (agg: 0-0) Fenerbahce 0-0
  Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Pafos 1-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg: 2-0) Plzen 0-0 Rangers (agg:
  0-3) 6 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) It’s been a frantic start to
  the game, with the home crowd making an almighty racket. No chances yet. Spurs
  play Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup tomorrow night. They’ll be without
  Yves Bissouma, who has been left out due to persistent lateness. Peep peep!
  The 6pm kick-offs are under way, and the atmosphere in Istanbul is
  spectypical. FC Copenhagen Kotarski, Huescas, Hatzidiakos, Gabriel Pereira,
  Lopez, Larsson, Mattsson, Lerager, Robert, Elyounoussi, Cornelius. Subs:
  Runarsson, Gadeberg-Burr, Garananga, Claesson, Moukoko, Zague, Sarapata,
  Meling, Delaney, Clem, West. Malmo FF Olsen, Rosler, Jansson, Duric,
  Busanello, Stryger Larsen, Rosengren, Johnsen, Berg, Bolin, Haksabanovic.
  Subs: Ellborg, Karlsson, Lewicki, Sigurdsson, Christiansen, Ekong, Holmquist

  Tengstedt, Targhaline, Sliti, Slory, Valente, Plug, Kraaijeveld. Referee
  Istvan Kovacs (Romania) Fenerbahce v Feyenoord The winners of this tie will
  meet Benfica or Nice in the final playoff round – probably Benfica, who lead
  2-0 from the first leg in France. The last time Fenerbahce reached the
  Champions League proper was in 2008-09; the last time Jose Mourinho did so
  was, I think, at Spurs in 2019-20. Hello, good evening and welcome to a bumper
  Champions League x EFL Cup clockwatch. We’ll have goal updates from Lisbon,
  Istanbul, Gillingham and elsewhere. These are our featured games, with Jose
  Mourinho’s Fenerbahce v Robin van Persie’s Feyenoord probably the pick.
  Champions League third qualifying round (6pm kick-off unless stated) FC
  Copenhagen v Malmo FF (first leg: 0-0) Fenerbahce v Feyenoord (first leg: 1-2)
  Plzen v Rangers (first leg: 0-3) Benfica v Nice (8pm, first leg: 2-0) EFL Cup
  (7.45pm unless stated) Coventry v Luton Gillingham v AFC Wimbledon Portsmouth
  v Reading Wrexham v Hull Bromley v Ipswich (8pm) And if you want to follow all
  the other goals as they go in, this link is your friend.

They will meet Benfica or Nice in the playoff round. Rangers will meet Club Brugge or Salzburg for a place in the Champions League proper. They won’t be thrilled to have lost tonight, but they did the hard yards by winning the first leg 3-0. 10 min: Northampton 0-0 Southampton “Nothing really drives relegation home like cup football in bloody August,” says Rachel Clifton, who may or may not be a Southampton fan. Jose’s great entertainers are home and hosed thanks to a precise finish from the substitute Talisca. Carabao Cup latest Bradford are 2-0 up away to Blackburn inside four minutes. I say! 90 min: Fenerbahce 4-2 Feyenoord (agg; 5-4) Six minutes of added time to play. We’re not done yet. The centre-half Tsuyoshi Watanabe smashes a volley into the net for his second goal of the night; Feyenoord need one more to take the tie to extra-time. Svetozar Markovic restores Plzen’s lead on the night. Nothing for Rangers to worry about at this stage, but there will be if Plzen get another quick goal. Fenerbahce were inviting pressure. Youssef En-Nesyri has finished off a terrific counter-attack to make it 4-1 on the night, 5-3 on aggregate. That’s a helluva comeback from Jose Mourinho’s side, who could have lost the head when they conceded in strange circumstances just before half-time. 80 min: Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) A terrible touch from Ueda, put through on goal, allows the Fenerbahce keeper Egribayat to make a brave save. But Fenerbahce are inviting pressure. Champions League qualifying latest (6pm KOs unless stated) Qarabag 5-1 Shkendija (FT; agg: 6-1) FC Copenhagen 5-0 Malmo FF (agg: 5-0) Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Pafos 2-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg: 3-0) Plzen 1-1 Rangers (agg: 1-4) Club Brugge 0-2 Salzburg (6.30pm; agg: 1-2) Ferencvaros 0-0 Ludogorets (7.15pm; agg: 0-0) Slovan Bratislava 0-0 Kairat Almaty (7.15pm; agg: 0-1) 76 min: FC Copenhagen 5-0 Malmo FF (agg: 5-0) Copenhagen are taking Malmo to the cleaners in the Scandinavian battle. Magnus Mattson and Robert, who also scored in the first half, have put them 5-0 in front. 75 min: Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Feyenoord sub Borges is booked for a late tackle, which leads to a brief bit of posturing from various players. I hate to shock you, but this might not finish 11 v 11. 72 min: Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Fenerbahce still lead but it’s getting tense, and very niggly on the touchline as well. That should be enough for Rangers. Lyall Cameron, signed from Dundee in the summer, has scored his first goal for the club to restore their three-goal lead. Champions League qualifying latest (6pm KOs unless stated) Qarabag 5-1 Shkendija (FT; agg: 6-1) FC Copenhagen 3-0 Malmo FF (agg: 3-0) Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Pafos 2-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg: 3-0) Plzen 1-0 Rangers (agg: 1-3) Club Brugge 0-2 Salzburg (6.30pm; agg: 1-2) 57 min: Fenerbahce 3-1 Feyenoord (agg: 4-3) Excluding added time, Fenerbahce have scored three goals in 12 minutes to turn the tie around. A reminder that the winners will play Benfica or Nice for a place in the competition proper. Last season’s inaugural league stage was fun but imagine Jose cutting a swathe through the thing. A sensational goal from Fred has put Fenerbahce ahead in the tie. Archie Brown did very well to win possession 30 yards from the Feyenoord goal, allowing Fred to collect the loose ball and curl a majestic shot into the top corner. Mohamed Elyounoussi has put Copenhagen 3-0 up against Malmo, both on the night and on aggregate. And in Belgium, Salzburg now lead 2-0 on the night, 2-1 on aggregate, thanks to Edmund Baidoo. 49 min: Fenerbahce 2-1 Feyenoord (agg: 3-3) A mistake from Amrabat allows the Feyenoord substitute Borges to run through on goal. He curls a shot across goal and Egribayat thrusts out his left leg to make a vital save. Carabao Cup latest Ronald has scored the first goal of the night in the Carabao Cup, putting Swansea ahead at home to Crawley after four minutes. That’s the only 7pm kick-off. The full fixture list is on our live scores page. Meanwhile, in the Guardian’s award-winning property section FC Copenhagen 2-0 Malmo FF (agg: 2-0) Fenerbahce 2-1 Feyenoord (agg: 3-3) Pafos 1-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg: 2-0) Plzen 1-0 Rangers (agg: 1-3) Qarabag thrashed Shkendija 5-1 (agg: 6-1) in the early game. And in a match that kicked off at 6.30pm, Salzburg are 1-0 up (agg: 1-1) away to Club Brugge. The winners of that tie will play Plzen or Rangers. Confused? Of course you are. Now all I need are the three digits on the back of the card. Rangers aren’t through just yet – Rafiu Durosinmi had put Plzen ahead on the night in the Czech Republic. The tie is all square after a terrific finish from Jhon Duran! A long ball was headed down expertly by En-Nesyri towards the onrushing Duran, who got to the ball a split-second before the defender and then, while still off-balance, flipped a shot into the far corner. Excellent goal. GOALS! FC Copenhagen 2-0 Malmo FF (agg: 2-0; Huescas 31, Robert 43) With all the excitement in Istanbul I missed not one but two goals for FC Copenhagen. Rodrigo Huescas and Robert (no relation) have put them in control of the tie. Fenerbahce needed a quick reply. It has come from the Englishman Archie Brown, who got between two defenders at the near post to head a left-wing corner into the net. Tsuyoshi Watanabe heads Feyenoord in front on the night! It was a terrific header – but Fenerbahce are not happy with the manner of the goal. Their keeper Irfan picked the ball well outside his area, thinking a free-kick had been given for handball against Ueda. It hadn’t, so the referee gave a free-kick to Feyenoord for the handball. Hwang clipped it in and Watanabe forced a header past Irfan at the near post. 38 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord Ayase Ueda has a shot saved after manufacturing space where there appeared to be none in the Fenerbahce area. The referee then gave a foul to Fener but I’m not sure whether that was before or after Ueda’s dizzying piece of skill. 31 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Amrabat runs through on goal from halfway, but his touch is slightly heavy and Watanabe comes across. He then plays a backpass that beats the keeper Wellenreuther and rolls just wide of goal. Actually I think Wellenreuther got a slight touch, without which there would probably have been a comedy own-goal. 31 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) We’ve now seen the offside lines for the disallowed goal; essential En-Nesyri’s knee was offside, but it was really close and you can understand why Mourinho was so expectant. The celebration might have been pushing it though. 29 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Jose Mourinho has started celebrating the goal… but now VAR have upheld the offside decision! Comedy gold in Istanbul. Mourinho is marching round with the face of a man who has just been told red is blue and blue is wibble. He’d seen a replay, judged it to be onside with the naked eye and started raising his fists triumphantly to the home fans. Then somebody gave him the bad news. 28 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Youssef En Nesyri has had a goal disallowed for offside – but it’s being checked and looks very tight. 25 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Jhon Duran has two attempts at goal in the space of five seconds. The first was blocked by a defender; the second took a deflection and was clawed behind by the keeper Timon Wellenreuther. Good save. If transfers are your jam, here’s the latest on the Premier League’s most wanted. 22 min: Plzen 0-0 Rangers (agg: 0-3) So far so good for Rangers in the Czech Republic. The winner of the tie will meet Club Brugge or Salzburg in the final playoff round. 15 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Jhon Duran – the very same – has just hit the side netting with Fener’s first half-chance. Feyenoord have probably played the more intricate football but Fenerbahce look a threat on the break. Champions League qualifying latest (6pm KOs unless stated) Qarabag 4-1 Shkendija (5pm, agg: 5-1) FC Copenhagen 0-0 Malmo FF (agg: 0-0) Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) Pafos 1-0 Dynamo Kyiv (agg: 2-0) Plzen 0-0 Rangers (agg: 0-3) 6 min: Fenerbahce 0-0 Feyenoord (agg: 1-2) It’s been a frantic start to the game, with the home crowd making an almighty racket. No chances yet. Spurs play Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup tomorrow night. They’ll be without Yves Bissouma, who has been left out due to persistent lateness. Peep peep! The 6pm kick-offs are under way, and the atmosphere in Istanbul is spectypical.

Referee Istvan Kovacs (Romania) Fenerbahce v Feyenoord The winners of this tie will meet Benfica or Nice in the final playoff round – probably Benfica, who lead 2-0 from the first leg in France. The last time Fenerbahce reached the Champions League proper was in 2008-09; the last time Jose Mourinho did so was, I think, at Spurs in 2019-20.
