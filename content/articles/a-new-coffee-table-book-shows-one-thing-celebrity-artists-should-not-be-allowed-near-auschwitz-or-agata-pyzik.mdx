  To say that a picture speaks a thousand words might no longer ring true. As
  images proliferate at an unprecedented rate online, they risk losing their
  meaning, especially as AI poses a growing threat to the truth of what we see.
  We might ask why images of the relentless killing and devastation in Gaza,
  there for all to see, have not yet halted the slaughter of Palestinians. Into
  this situation comes Juergen Teller, “enfant terrible” of 1990s fashion
  photography, who has produced a coffee-table book about the Nazis’
  concentration and extermination camp in Auschwitz. This goes some way beyond
  his usual remit. Teller is known for his knack for making pretty things look
  ugly, as a shorthand for “authenticity”, associated with the grunge aesthetic
  and so-called “heroin chic”, which made him the most in-demand fashion
  photographer of his era. The book, titled simply Auschwitz Birkenau, is
  published by the biggest German art book publisher, Steidl, with a cover
  designed by Peter Saville, the man behind so much revered Joy Division and
  Factory Records artwork What is actually in the book? Photography-wise, it is
  fairly bland, documenting the site as it stands today, preserved as a monument
  against forgetfulness as the Memorial and Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The
  selection could have been taken from an anonymous Flickr account. Like an
  overbearing tourist, Teller photographs every single thing he sees in
  Oświęcim, the town where the camp is located: from the electronic parking
  plates and tacky hot baguette parlours to the details of the gas chambers.
  There’s no hierarchy. But the haste is visible. All the pictures – more than
  800 in total – were taken on an iPhone, and with stupefying simplicity: close
  shot of the barracks, details, then a panorama; a close shot of empty Zyklon B
  cans, then a wider shot, a panorama; and again and again in the same way. He
  uses the same approach for a pseudo-poignant “perspective through the barbed
  wire” photograph, and wistful closeups of melting snow-covered grass. The
  photographs are interspersed with memories of former prisoners, collected by
  Christoph Heubner, the executive vice-president of the International Auschwitz
  Committee, who invited Teller to carry out this project, and who is also
  behind the Gerhard Richter Birkenau pavilion, an exhibition space which opened
  in Oświęcim last year. Teller’s book caught my attention precisely because of
  Huebner’s involvement, as it made me wonder: why would you invite a celebrity
  artist – a German one at that – to document Auschwitz? The problem with
  Teller’s book is not that he’s famous, nor that his most famous work is in
  fashion – it’s that these photographs contribute nothing to a deeper
  understanding of Auschwitz. The pictures are totally unremarkable, and get
  nowhere near what new photography of Auschwitz ought to strive for: to refocus
  our attention on something previously unnoticed. Perhaps you could argue that
  this is a deliberate strategy, and a more thoughtful one – for Teller to
  suspend his own personal style and render himself invisible. Except that he
  isn’t invisible. In one of the former barracks, block 27, there’s a special
  interactive installation devoted to various nations’ experience of
  extermination, including a Yad Vashem-inspired “Book of Names”: a library of
  books containing the name of every single documented Auschwitz victim (it is
  ever-expanding). And what does he do with it? He photographs all the pages
  with the surname “Teller” on it. Of course, thousands of German-born Jews were
  murdered in the Holocaust. But to single out your own name is not a gesture of
  solidarity – it’s narcissism. As perpetrators, the Germans strictly controlled
  any photographic evidence of the extermination, ensuring no documentation
  escaped the walls of the death camps. Indeed, there is a vital and ongoing
  debate about whether photography is an appropriate way to address the
  Holocaust at all, given that the original photographic record does not exist.
  Earlier this year, the Auschwitz Memorial established a digital replica of the
  camp, prompted by growing interest from film-makers (at present, only
  documentaries are permitted to be filmed there). The only known pictures of
  the extermination camps are the four Sonderkommando photographs, secretly
  taken by Jewish prisoners and smuggled out, which have become the subject of
  the Gerhard Richter paintings on display at the Oświęcim pavilion. On the wall
  of the pavilion there is a quote from Richter: “Picturing things, taking a
  view, is what makes us human.” This drove the ire of the Jewish-German artist
  Leon Kahane, who in his current DIALOG DIALOG DIALOG exhibition counters
  Richter’s take with four blank sheets, mirroring Richter’s format, repeating
  the German master’s quote in three languages. Kahane supplements this with
  photographs of a contemporary neo-Nazi demonstration, pointing our attention
  towards the real and ongoing problem of antisemitism in Germany. What if the
  most human thing is in fact to refrain from forming an image? Kahane’s empty
  canvases point to a broader crisis around how to represent the Holocaust.
  Richter’s approach introduces unnecessary pathos, making the evil universally
  human, rather than an act committed by a specific nation nurtured in a
  specific culture. But at least it arguably opens an interesting philosophical
  argument. No such thing can be said about Teller’s Auschwitz Birkenau book.
  His view of the camp is banal, or occasionally sentimental (pictures of
  souvenir kitsch included). In a moment where the very legacy of the Holocaust
  is being politicised, it is detached and generalising, blurring notions of
  responsibility, while seeming worryingly like a vanity project. Visiting
  Auschwitz has become too easy a way for Germans and other nations alike to
  show how far they’ve come; that they’re now free of antisemitism. With
  Teller’s book in hand, maybe even that won’t feel necessary to some. As
  artists and as societies, we bear a responsibility to history. If Auschwitz is
  allowed to become an increasingly empty symbol, and we lose our ability to
  capture the horror of the Holocaust, how are we going to ensure that future
  generations understand that it really happened? Agata Pyzik is a critic and
  author of Poor but Sexy: Culture Clashes in Europe East and West. She lives in
  Warsaw Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you
