  borrowing and rate cuts drive purchases

  Property investors borrowed a record sum, nearly $130bn, to buy homes over the
  year to June, supported by interest rate cuts but squeezing out first-time
  buyers. Banks made almost 200,000 new loans to landlords over the year, the
  most since 2022, while the number of new first-home mortgages slipped to
  116,000. Cameron Kusher, an independent property expert, said falling interest
  rates have made borrowing easier for mortgage-holding homeowners and investors
  than for first home buyers. “They’re going to get relief on those mortgages in
  terms of their repayments, and they’re going to be the ones that are probably
  going to capitalise on this most,” Kusher said. More than $340bn was lent for
  new home loans in the year to June, according to Australian Bureau of
  Statistics data, released on Wednesday. Annual lending flows have risen $70bn
  since June 2023, more than half from new investor loans. Property investors
  borrowed $33bn in the June quarter, while first-time buyers borrowed less than
  half that much. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Pressure on first-time buyers
  has heightened as investors target lower-priced homes and more affordable
  regions. The average new investor loan was $100,000 smaller in June than in
  March, at under $640,000. Landlord borrowing grew steadily in Tasmania and the
  Northern Territory. Interest rate cuts have boosted incomes and wealth for
  landlords and existing homeowners by lowering their mortgage repayments and
  driving up their property prices, Kusher said. “It’s increasingly getting
  harder for first-time buyers to compete with investors and non-first home
  buyers [who] have already got equity … as opposed to a first-time buyer, who’s
  been out of the market and is paying a lot more for rent,” he said. A rise in
  competition and prices has resulted in the number and value of new first-time
  buyer loans plateauing in recent years. Credit bureau Equifax in July found
  first home buyers’ mortgage demand had slumped over the previous 12 months and
  would not recover by December. Richard Brown, a Sydney mortgage broker, said
  some of his renter clients were waiting until 2026 to try to buy a home, after
  the Albanese government announced in April it would broaden access to its
  mortgage guarantee. “They were gearing towards purchase, but now, since that
  announcement, they may delay for six months,” he said. Investor clients were
  buying much faster, seeking income boosts as rent prices continued to rise and
  loan repayments fell, Brown said. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s rate cuts
  have also helped owner-occupiers take out increasingly expensive loans, though
  the number of new borrowers hardly budged, as house prices raced upwards.
  Accelerating increases in property values and expectations for more interest
  rate cuts have led to growing number of analysts hike their price predictions,
  with ANZ in August calling a 5% rise nationwide in 2025 and nearly 6% in 2026.
