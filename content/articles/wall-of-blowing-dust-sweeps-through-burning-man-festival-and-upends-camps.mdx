  Burning Man festival temporarily ground to a halt over the weekend due to dust
  storms and high winds that sent tents flying and plunged visibility to near
  zero. On Monday, organizers of the Nevada festival said the Black Rock City
  airport and the festival gates had reopened as the festival officially got
  under way. According to San Francisco Chronicle, a powerful dust storm swept
  through the Black Rock Desert – where the annual event is held – on Saturday
  evening, damaging campsites, causing travel delays and resulting in at least
  four minor injuries. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm advisory
  for the area that evening, warning of a “wall of blowing dust” moving
  northward at 30mph (48km/h), with strong wind gusts “in excess of 45mph”. One
  attendee told the Chronicle they saw tents and structures “being ripped and
  torn down by the wind speeds even though we buttoned everything down as best
  as we could”. Footage shared on social media by attendees who had already set
  up camp ahead of Sunday’s official festival start showed intense winds, dust
  storms and collapsed tents. A spokesperson for the Burning Man Project told
  SFGate that wind gusts reached over 45mph for a “sustained period of time” and
  that “participants and staff were advised to batten down their camps and avoid
  driving during low visibility”. On Sunday – the first official day of the 2025
  festival – the NWS issued another dust advisory as well as a wind advisory,
  forecasting gusts up to 50mph, along with potential rain and scattered
  thunderstorms. On Sunday night, the organizers closed the gate in and out of
  Black Rock City, and halted flights in the area. They urged those already on
  site to “secure your structures and belongings” and to not drive. By early
  Monday, organizers said that conditions had improved and at 7.30am local time,
  organizers said that the gate was open and that the airport had resumed
  function. In the statement on Monday, the festival organizers said that “due
  to variable weather conditions over the past few days, wait times from the
  8-mile playa entrance on County Route 34 to the Gate are expected to range 6-8
  hours today but could change with the weather”. But the grim weather
  conditions may not be over yet. Organizers also warned that Monday’s forecast
  includes “potential precipitation” in the afternoon and early evening and that
  the “weather continues to be unstable and is expected to be unstable for two
  more days”. They urged attendees to “keep an eye on the forecast as you plan
  your travel to Black Rock City” and to “plan for additional potential weather
  related delays”. The NWS in Elko has warned that “monsoonal moisture will
  stream northward into most of Northern and Central Nevada today through
  Thursday, resulting in the likelihood of wetting thunderstorms each afternoon
  and evening” and that “heavy rain may cause minor flooding of recent burn
  scars, streams, and creeks”. Roughly 70,000 people are expected to attend this
  year’s festival, which runs through 1 September, according to NBC News. The
  situation was reminiscent of the disastrous weather that plagued the event in
  2023, when heavy rain stranded tens of thousands at the festival, turning the
  site into a mud pit and prompting emergency shelter-in-place orders. One death
  was reported.
