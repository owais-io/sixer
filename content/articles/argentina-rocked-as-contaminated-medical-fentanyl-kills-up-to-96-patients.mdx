  As many as 96 people are now thought to have died in Argentina after being
  treated with medical-use fentanyl that was tainted with bacteria. The official
  death toll stands at 87, and a judicial source has told the Buenos Aires
  Herald that nine further deaths are under investigation. The alarm was first
  raised in May, when dozens of hospital patients suffered serious bacterial
  infections. Strains of the bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Ralstonia
  pickettii – some of which were resistant to multiple antibiotics – were
  detected in the patients. Investigators said the source was fentanyl, which it
  traced to the pharmaceutical company HLB Pharma and its laboratory,
  Laboratorio Ramallo. Tests carried out by Argentina’s drug regulator, Anmat,
  confirmed bacterial contamination in the deceased and in ampoules from two
  fentanyl batches prepared by the company – one of which had been “widely
  circulated”, according to the federal judge Ernesto Kreplak, who is leading
  the investigation. In an interview with La Nación, the owner of HLB Pharma,
  Ariel García Furfaro, denied that the deaths could be directly attributed to
  his product, said his company pulled it from the market itself, and claimed
  that if the ampoules were contaminated, someone had “planted” the contaminant.
  The patients had been hospitalised for unrelated conditions and were given the
  drug for pain relief or anaesthetic, before becoming infected with the
  multidrug-resistant bacteria. Authorities say the contamination may have
  affected more than 300,000 ampoules distributed across Buenos Aires province,
  Santa Fe, Córdoba, Formosa and Buenos Aires city; an estimated 45,000 had been
  administered before the remainder were withdrawn and seized. “Argentina has
  never experienced such a serious case. It is unprecedented,” said Adriana
  Francese, lawyer for four of the victims’ families. The human toll has been
  severe. “The fentanyl caused their death within days,” Alejandro Ayala,
  brother of Leonel, who died at 32, told AFP last week. The mother of
  18-year-old Renato Nicolini, who was hospitalised following a car accident and
  later died from the fentanyl complications, told Efe: “He began to improve
  little by little, and on the third day, they discovered he had pneumonia. His
  fever couldn’t be controlled, and seven days later, he died.” The ampoules
  from the affected batch have been recalled, and Kreplak has said:
  “Contaminated ampoules are not circulating today.” Yet the death toll
  continues to climb as investigators analyse more cases of patients who died in
  recent months after receiving the medication. No charges have yet been filed,
  but the court has named 24 people involved in the manufacture and sale of the
  opioid as suspects. They have been banned from leaving the country and had
  their assets frozen. Francese said the investigation was looking at how the
  contaminated batches were manufactured and what quality controls were in
  place. “This is going to be very important to determine responsibility,” she
  said. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid approved for pain relief and anaesthetic,
  is between 50 and 100 times more powerful than morphine.
