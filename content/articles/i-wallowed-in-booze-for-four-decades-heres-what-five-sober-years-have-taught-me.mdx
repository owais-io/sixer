  Everyone needs a hobby, and for 40 years mine was booze. I was 17 when I drank
  enough to throw up for the first time, and 57 when I stopped. In between I
  spent most nights, and thousands of lunchtimes and afternoons, with at least a
  gentle buzz on. One cheeky pint would turn into three, four, a binge. I
  blacked out. I had fumbling, regrettable sex. I vomited out of cars and on to
  lawns. I drank wine at 50p a bottle and £15 a glass – and a sea of lager,
  lager, lager. There was vodka flavoured with everything, from raspberries to
  rhubarb and bacon, plus gin and armagnac and amaretto and tequila and eggnog
  and crème de menthe and Baileys and sherry and blue curaçao and bourbon and
  cider and Kahlúa. Some evenings I would laugh and laugh and laugh; other times
  drinking felt more like a grim duty. I talked bollocks, I slurred my words, I
  lost the ability to speak, I had drunken arguments. I stole a huge block of
  cheese, a library book, a punt, a traffic cone. (I was arrested for the last
  one, and when I was being cautioned the officer said I seemed like a bright
  lad, and had I considered a career in the police?) I slept terribly, waking to
  a splitting head and a sweaty fear of what I might have got up to. All this
  again and again and again and again. Account for inflation, and I spent
  hundreds of thousands of pounds on drinks I didn’t particularly enjoy, meals I
  didn’t need, clubs, taxis, all the crap you’d never buy if you were in your
  right mind. That’s the price of a house down the drain. Most of this happened
  in London, when I worked in an office and there was always someone to drink
  with, but in my 40s I lived on my own in deepest rural France, and that wasn’t
  much better. Drop in on a neighbour, even at 10am, and you’d be offered a
  tumbler of wine. My little house in the woods had a cellar, and booze flowed
  in and out of it like the tide: beaujolais, bordeaux, bourgogne, côtes du
  Rhône, corbières, corbières-boutenac; Grimbergen, Blanche de Bruxelles, Leffe
  Blonde, Leffe Brune, Leffe Triple … I arrived in 2003, and sat out that year’s
  heatwave in a deckchair, drinking Pelforth in the shade of my favourite
  spruce, and using the bilberries that grew all around to flavour supermarket
  spirits. Every now and again, I would send photos of dewy glasses to friends
  back in Britain: look at me, I’m living the life, this stuff is practically
  free! My home was in the mountains, on the side that caught the storms. On
  summer nights lightning would hit the power lines, plunging the house into
  darkness. One August, as thunder shook the forest, I sat under the tallest
  tree, thrilling to the flashes, knocking back the vodka and oblivious to the
  fact that the next bolt might be aimed at me. Most evenings, though, I would
  open a bottle of rasteau and sit on the terrace to enjoy the sunset. One
  night, polishing off a last few glasses by starlight, I spotted a man with a
  rifle lurking near the house – and decided it would be a good idea to chase
  him through the woods, while shouting that I had a gun of my own, which I
  didn’t. Most shamefully of all, I’d been drinking with my grownup daughter,
  and I dragged her along with me. I didn’t wrong anyone so badly that I can’t
  look myself in the face, but there are a lot of people I ought to say sorry
  to. It wasn’t all bad. I had some lovely drunken meals, drunken chats and
  drunken romances. I’m shy, and booze helped me unbend, make friends and meet
  women. Without it, I might never have got more than a hug from the woman who
  is now my wife. All the same, the more I drank, the more I tired of the crap
  that went with it – not just the misbehaving and the hangxiety but the
  knowledge that none of this was good for my health. Ask Dr Jeevan Fernando, an
  associate at the charity Alcohol Change UK, how booze can damage your body and
  he’ll mention liver disease, of course, and sleep problems, and osteoporosis
  and drunken falls. “But one that I worry about most is the risk of dementia
  and cognitive decline,” he says. “Heavy alcohol use is very strongly related
  to the decline and atrophy of your brain. There is a normal shrinkage that
  occurs with age, but alcohol can increase that – and the risk of dementia
  later in life. Then there’s mental health. There is very, very strong evidence
  of a link to increased anxiety and rates of depression.” There’s more. “Also,
  chronic alcohol use is related to cardiovascular issues. You have a much
  higher rate of heart attacks, strokes; your blood pressure is worse. Alcohol
  is also a known carcinogen – heavily related to breast cancer, liver cancer,
  bowel cancer …” By my mid-50s, I had seen one close friend drink herself to
  death. Had I already pushed my own luck too far? I would occasionally attempt
  to cut down, to have just a few drinks rather than a session, but never got
  very far. One mouthful was enough to get me in the zone and wash away my
  resolve. “This is nice,” my mind would say. “More will be even nicer.” As for
  stopping completely, that wasn’t on my radar. Booze was how I switched off
  after a stressful day, how I put a smile on my face. How would I relax without
  it? How would I fill the evenings? I could hardly become Teetotal Phil if I
  couldn’t even visualise Teetotal Phil. But then, five years ago, on 2 August
  2020, I just packed it in. This may not mean much unless you’re a hardened
  drinker, but I have got through Christmas parties sober, and office leaving
  dos. I have survived two wedding receptions on nothing more than alcohol-free
  wine and beer. Oh, and cocaine, but I never set out to give that up. Joke! I
  have barely touched drugs in my life, apart from the liquid, legal, socially
  acceptable one. I’m not about to start now. I’m not going to lie: I don’t
  socialise as readily as I used to. Right now, as I write this, I could be at a
  summer drinks party with my workmates. But I know that as the evening wears on
  we’d drift apart, like radios that can’t hold a frequency. I’d bring everyone
  down, the dry ghost at the feast. This is a me-problem, as other non-drinkers
  seem to cope. Practice would help – but, although I have never thought of
  myself as tight, the new me struggles with the idea of paying 30 or 40 quid
  for a round when I’d be knocking back Diet Coke. How have I filled the hours
  when I would have been drinking? I watch more TV than I used to, and fuss over
  our two dogs, who soak up attention like hairy sponges. And I exercise –
  running, yoga, Hiit, calisthenics. A class here, a workshop there. I’ve set up
  some gymnastics rings in the garden. I’m studying to be a personal trainer.
  I’d like to learn to juggle. I meet more people than I ever did, and I can
  actually remember their names afterwards. I’m happier and more stable than I
  used to be, and now that I have learned there are other ways to handle stress,
  I don’t worry that some disaster will send me back to the bottle. I was struck
  – and inspired – by something that the personal trainer Tara LaFerrara posted
  on Threads last month, after the sudden death of her mother. The two had a
  “tough” relationship, which left a lot to untangle. “I could have easily drunk
  alcohol during this time of grief, family drama and loss,” LaFerrara wrote,
  “but I have not. Not one sip of alcohol in almost 1,000 days. Proud of that.”
  She gave up on her first wedding anniversary, almost three years ago. “I just
  realised it wasn’t serving me any more,” she tells me. “I didn’t like the
  taste or how it made me feel during or after. Now I sleep better, have more
  energy, more clarity, better relationships with my friends and my partner.”
  How did she take her mind off her mum? “Getting outside in nature, walks,
  meditation, and working out has helped more than anything else.” And drinking?
  “I wasn’t tempted. Sitting in this pain and really feeling your raw emotions
  is wild.” The wild thing about my own journey, at least to me, is not that I
  gave up, but how easy it was. I had – still have – the occasional wistful
  longing for a cold beer on a hot day, or a glass of red when I’m cooking, but
  that’s it. I didn’t need hypnosis, medication or a support group, although I
  am not against any of those things. I didn’t feel ashamed about taking
  antidepressants when I needed them, or getting therapy for insomnia and
  anxiety. I am aware of how very lucky I have been. Cold turkey will not be
  right for everyone. “If you are a very heavy drinker,” Dr Fernando warns,
  “abruptly stopping may cause withdrawal symptoms, so you should speak to your
  GP.” All that said, and without wishing to trivialise anyone dealing with
  addiction, not everyone will find abstinence an uphill struggle. What helped
  me? Clearly – and miraculously – my dependency on alcohol was far more
  psychological than physical. Despite the amount I had been drinking, stopping
  didn’t give me headaches, or jitters, or overpowering cravings. And I was
  lucky enough to have a good marriage, to a woman who had also drunk her fill.
  Hannah was the one who first decided to take a break from booze, and I just
  tagged along, partly to support her. She wasn’t a world-class boozehound like
  me, but she did enjoy a drink. “Ever since I was little,” she says, “it has
  been the ultimate treat, the ultimate reward, the ultimate celebration, the
  ultimate commiseration.” On the downside: “As I got older,” she says, “my
  hangovers were fucking biblical.” The day after my 57th birthday, “absolutely
  annihilated”, she announced she was taking three months off the booze. Ten
  days later, when I got back from a long-planned holiday, I followed suit. When
  the three months were up, we both decided to carry on. “After a while,” as
  Hannah puts it, “the idea of going back becomes absurd. And you think, ‘Well,
  I could maybe drink on special occasions’ – but I don’t know what occasion
  could possibly be special enough.” There have been no dramas, no relapses,
  none of that tension you’d get between a spouse who gets sloshed every night
  and one whose body is a temple. We’re closer now than we were five years ago.
  The only fly in the ointment is that 10-day head start. Unless she falls off
  the wagon, she’ll always be slightly more awesome than me. I’m trying to get
  over it. A survey of British drinkers last year found 48% wanted to cut down
  or stop entirely. It’s a similar story in the US and Australia. Do I have any
  advice for them? Nothing that would qualify me to open a detox clinic. But I
  will say that even if you think you can’t give up, there may come a point when
  you find yourself pushing at an open door. And, however much you wish you had
  done it before, you may not have left it too late. I’ve had a lot of tests in
  the year or so since I started writing about health, and as far as I can tell
  my liver, brain, heart etc are all in good shape. My teeth are yellower than
  I’d like, which I blame on the wine, and there are broken veins in my nose and
  cheeks, but that’s all the obvious damage. Despite those 40 stupid years, I’m
  hopeful I dodged a bullet. Maybe I was staggering so much it didn’t hit me.
