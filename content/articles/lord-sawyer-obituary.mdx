  It is only the passage of time that has revealed the extent of the role played
  by Tom Sawyer, the former Labour general secretary, who has died aged 82, in
  the regeneration of his party before its triumphant return to power in the
  1997 general election. He used his authority as a distinguished trade union
  leader and his credibility as a one-time stalwart of the left to show the
  Labour party membership a way out of the political wilderness. It was his
  unseen hand that drew the route map. It was his work on the party’s national
  executive committee (NEC) that secured a radical review of Labour’s policies,
  specifically its previous commitments to unilateralism and opposition to
  Europe, after its humiliating third consecutive general election defeat in
  1987. And it was he who recognised the need to modernise the party culture to
  reflect the politics of the time; he saw that this should address its approach
  to wealth creation and enterprise, and then effectively erected the
  scaffolding to remodel Labour’s own constitution. His aim was to present
  Labour as an attractive and credible future government, with a realistic
  agenda that came from a process of democratic policymaking, while
  simultaneously avoiding the constant political divisions that had historically
  been publicly aired at party conferences. This was the origin of what became
  known as “partnership in power”, for which Sawyer prepared the ground as chair
  of the NEC’s influential home policy committee from 1987 and delivered when
  Tony Blair won the leadership in 1994 and appointed Sawyer general secretary.
  He was a genial man who exuded the calm common sense for which he came to be
  lauded by successive Labour leaders and it was, perhaps, precisely because of
  his experience as a leftwing trade unionist, who had led his members out on
  strike, that he recognised the importance of consensus. He was close to Neil
  Kinnock and would quote the then Labour leader’s salient comment that “only
  people with very shallow convictions are afraid of compromise”. Sawyer’s
  particular skill lay in persuading others to an agreed position without
  seeming to promote his own viewpoint. Kinnock regarded him as a bridge who
  could “bring people over” and would quote him the Welsh proverb: “A fo ben,
  bid bont” (He who would be a leader, let him be a bridge). The wellspring of
  Sawyer’s politics was a belief in social justice. He was born in Darlington,
  in the streets behind the town’s one-time major employer, the Cleveland Bridge
  Manufacturing company – famed for building the Sydney Harbour Bridge – the son
  of a railway worker and a domestic cleaner employed by a local doctor. He went
  to Dodmire primary school, Eastbourne comprehensive school and attended
  Darlington Technical College aged 13 to 15. He then became a “Stivvie”,
  apprenticed to Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns, Darlington’s famous locomotive
  builders, but was unemployed with a wife and son when the company closed five
  years later. He moved his family to find work in the booming motor industry,
  with Lockheed Brakes in Leamington Spa, and most significantly for his career
  took an interest in trade unions, joining the Amalgamated Engineering Union
  (AEU). His mentor, Geoff Thatcher, was a shop steward who looked like Karl
  Marx and opened a door in the young Sawyer’s mind by lending him books and
  political pamphlets. He was a shop steward himself within two years. Returning
  to his home town for a job at Cummins’ Darlington engine plant, he joined the
  Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU) in order to secure union
  recognition for the white-collar workers. He became secretary of the
  Darlington Trades Council, met the local Labour MP and joined the Labour party
  in 1968; three years later he answered a Tribune advertisement for a post as a
  trade union official with the National Union of Public Employees (Nupe),
  taking a pay cut of a third of his £1,500 salary. He became deputy to his
  lifelong friend, Rodney Bickerstaffe, and in 1975 succeeded him as Nupe’s
  northern region organiser. In 1981, he followed Bickerstaffe to London to
  become his deputy general secretary at Nupe headquarters, which in turn gave
  Sawyer his place on the Labour NEC. Sawyer was already far-sighted as a young,
  leather-jacketed, leftwing activist, seeing the need to move trade unionism
  onwards from its cloth-cap image. He had become a night-time student with the
  Workers’ Educational Association, was reading widely – cultivating an interest
  that would lead to a 5,000-book library and a fascination for antiquarian
  literature. As a union official he was involved in the 1973 ambulance workers’
  strike in County Durham, in the 1974 widespread industrial action that led to
  the “three-day week” and the collapse of the Heath government, and in the
  “winter of discontent” public sector strikes of 1978-79, which contributed to
  the fall of the Callaghan government. But he had also developed a concern for
  society that stretched beyond pay and conditions. This he articulated in a
  speech at the 1987 Labour conference, when he spoke movingly about his vision
  of a society where skills and wealth were harnessed to social need, deference
  replaced with dignity and fear with a sense of security. By this time Sawyer
  had become a focal member of the party “soft left”. He rejected the mindset of
  the union left, which had sought a general strike in support of the
  mineworkers’ year-long action in 1984-85, categorising it as the “worst kind
  of gesture politics”, but the crucial issue for him became his membership of
  the party inquiry into entrysim by the Trotskyist group, Militant – notably in
  Liverpool. His own conversations in the course of the inquiry led him to form
  a radically differing view from his NEC leftwing former associates, and his
  was the majority casting vote in 1986 in favour of expulsion of Militant
  members. Sawyer played an important role in the 1993 formation of Unison: the
  amalgamation of Nupe with the Confederation of Health Service Employees
  (Cohse) and the National and Local Government Officers Association (Nalgo) to
  form a 1.3 million-member giant. He left the union the following year to
  become Labour’s general secretary, but first helped the Labour leader, John
  Smith, to deliver the one-member, one-vote reform at the 1993 Brighton
  conference. He was interested in new methods of managing change in large
  organisations and took advice on the creation of Unison from Cranfield School
  of Management, a strategy he would subsequently extend to his Labour party
  constitutional reform during his four years as general secretary. On stepping
  down from that post in 1998, at Tony Blair’s request, he became a life peer.
  He did not take an active role in the House of Lords, but delighted in his
  post as a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management from
  (1999-2013). He was chancellor of the University of Teesside (2005-17) and
  president of the William Morris Society (2018-23). He was a popular chair of
  the Notting Hill Housing group and a non-executive director of Investors in
  People UK (both 1998-2005). He was also a director of the Britannia Building
  Society (1999-2009), chaired the Reed Health Group (2001-03) and the Royal
  Mail Partnership Board (2001-07). Tom Sawyer adopted the name of Mark Twain’s
  fictional hero as a boy. In 1962 he married Sylvia Park and they had a son,
  Mark; they later divorced. He is survived by Liz (Elizabeth), a former nursing
  sister and shop steward who became his second wife, their sons, Jack and Tom,
  and Mark. • Tom (Lawrence) Sawyer, Lord Sawyer, trade unionist and politician,
  born 12 May 1943; died 3 August 2025
