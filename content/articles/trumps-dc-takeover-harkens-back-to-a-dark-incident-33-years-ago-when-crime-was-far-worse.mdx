  Donald Trump’s takeover of Washington DC’s police department and decision to
  deploy the national guard was sparked by the assault of a former Doge staffer
  who nicknamed himself “Big Balls”. Thirty-three years ago, a fatal attack on a
  congressional staffer also provoked an effort by the federal government to
  impose law and order on the nation’s capital – but in that case, it came from
  Capitol Hill. On Monday, Trump said he was taking “a historic action to rescue
  our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse.
  This is liberation day in DC and we’re going to take our capital back.” In
  1992, it was the death of 25-year-old Tom Barnes, a staffer for Senator
  Richard Shelby, a Democrat of Alabama, that prompted the senator to introduce
  legislation to legalize the death penalty in the district. Shelby, a
  conservative Democrat who would become a Republican two years later,
  acknowledged that many DC community leaders had historically been opposed to
  the death penalty, but argued that the tide had changed – using similar
  dystopian language as Trump. “The terror that comes with living in a war zone
  has prompted many residents to reconsider the appropriateness, ethically and
  legally, of a death penalty,” Shelby wrote in a March 1992 Washington Post
  op-ed. “… People are using guns to settle arguments about clothes and
  girlfriends. They are ‘smoking’ others because they feel like it. They will
  even ‘bust a cap in you’ if they don’t like the way you look at them.” In
  announcing the police takeover on Monday, Trump cited the attack on Edward
  Coristine, who he said was “savagely beaten by a band of roaming thugs” and
  was “left dripping in blood”. He also referenced the June slaying of Eric
  Tarpinian-Jachym, an intern for the Republican representative Ron Estes, of
  Kansas, who was killed by crossfire in a drive-by shooting. Last week, his
  mother, Tamara Tarpinian-Jachym, told ABC News that she supported Trump’s idea
  of a federal takeover, which he had threatened in a social media post. There
  was one key difference between then and now: Trump is painting an exaggerated
  picture of crime in DC, where violent crime is at a 30-year low. But back in
  January 1992, Washington really was a crime-plagued city. It was coming off a
  year that saw 482 murders in 1991, earning it the ignoble title of the murder
  capital of the US. By contrast, there were 187 homicides last year and the
  city is on pace for a lower number this year. According to the book Dream
  City: Race, Power, and the Decline of Washington DC by Harry Jaffe and Tom
  Sherwood, Barnes, the Shelby staffer, left his home on a Saturday night in
  January 1992 to go to the corner store to get coffee grounds for the next
  morning. A group of teenagers approached him and demanded his money or they’d
  “put a cap” in him. “Leave me alone,” Barnes replied, and turned up the
  street. One of them shot him in the head, landing him in a coma. He died four
  days later, marking the 22nd homicide of the new year. A Capitol Outrage, ran
  the headline on a Tuscaloosa News editorial two days later. “Beset by
  drug-related violence,” the newspaper declared, “Washington has become a
  national disgrace, an American embarrassment.” “Tom’s death was the catalyst
  for my involvement in trying to find solutions to the violent crime that
  plagues our city,” said Shelby, who had known Barnes since he was a toddler.
  His bill to impose the death penalty on DC failed, but he did get Congress to
  vote to force the city to hold a referendum on that fall’s ballot asking
  Washingtonians to authorize capital punishment. “The criminal justice system
  is out of control in this city and Congress is not going to turn its back on
  this issue,” Shelby said. Even some home-rule champions on the Hill voted with
  Shelby, such as Leon Panetta, a Democratic representative from California. “I
  really think the District of Columbia ought to handle its own affairs,” said
  Panetta, who would go on to serve as chief of staff to Bill Clinton, CIA
  director and defense secretary. “But crime continues to be a very serious
  problem in the district. Part of it is the urban crisis that is part of every
  city’s social and economic problems. But I don’t get the sense that the
  district has a strong commitment to confront this issue.” The DC council had
  repealed the death penalty in 1981, but the last execution in Washington took
  place in 1957, years before the city won home rule in 1973. This week,
  Washington leaders bristled at Trump’s takeover of the police. Eleanor Holmes
  Norton, a non-voting delegate representing DC in the House of Representatives,
  called it “an historic assault on DC home rule”, while the mayor, Muriel E
  Bowser, described it as “unsettling and unprecedented”. There was a similarly
  visceral reaction to Shelby’s death penalty referendum. “There is something
  approaching rage among the voters of the district about their disempowerment,
  about Congress forcing this on us,” said Norton, who was in her first term in
  Congress at the time. “When you mandate a death penalty vote, you engage that
  issue directly.” Leading up to the referendum, dozens of ministers denounced
  it at Sunday sermons, the Washington Post reported. On 3 November 1992 – the
  same day Democrat Bill Clinton won his first presidential election –
  Washingtonians rejected the death penalty referendum by a 2-1 margin. “Today
  the voters sent a powerful message to every member of the US Congress that we
  are citizens of this country,” the then mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, said after
  the vote, while Norton said the vote showed the city “will not tolerate this
  interference from the outside”. But the climate of fear around crime had won
  some support for capital punishment. “In neighborhoods across the city, among
  rich and poor, black and white, some residents have argued that violence has
  become so random and brutal that convicted killers should be punished with the
  ultimate act of retribution, regardless of whether it serves as a deterrent,”
  the Post reported. But others cited concerns that it would be used unfairly
  against Black defendants, or didn’t like Congress interfering in the city’s
  affairs, in their votes against it. Even the city council chair, John Wilson,
  who supported the death penalty, urged a no vote as a signifier of DC’s
  independence. (Today, the city hall is named for him.) “It’s not that they
  didn’t favor the death penalty,” Jaffe and Sherwood wrote of DC voters. “Many
  black Washingtonians are quite conservative, law-and-order advocates … They
  just resented a white senator from Alabama telling them that they needed a
  death penalty to make their streets safe.” Today, there is definitely some
  resentment at a white president from New York who says he wants to clean up
  the city streets. And Bowser is using it as a way to rally support for the
  long-held goal of DC statehood. “My message to residents is this: we know that
  access to our democracy is tenuous,” she said at a news conference after
  Trump’s takeover. “That is why you have heard me and many, many Washingtonians
  before me advocate for full statehood for the District of Columbia. We are
  American citizens. Our families go to war. We pay taxes, and we uphold the
  responsibilities of citizenship.” Frederic J Frommer, a writer and sports and
  politics historian, has written for the Washington Post, the New York Times,
  the Atlantic, History.com and other national publications
