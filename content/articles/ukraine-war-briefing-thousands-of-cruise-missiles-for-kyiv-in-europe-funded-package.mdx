  Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands will potentially buy 3,350 ERAM
  air-launched cruise missiles for Ukraine in an $825m sale approved by the US
  state department, the Pentagon said on Thursday. The extended range attack
  munition has a range of “several hundred” miles, according to one of the
  manufacturers. The package includes the missiles’ GPS guidance kits,
  electronic warfare defences and more, and apart from the European contribution
  has additional US government funding. The approval does not mean the sale has
  been concluded. Longer-range “standoff” missiles like the ERAM can be fired by
  Ukrainian warplanes from a distance, allowing them to hit Russian targets with
  less risk of a fighter jet being shot down. Allies of Ukraine have prioritised
  developing a series of lower cost, more versatile missiles for Kyiv to use on
  the battlefield. It is now “obvious” that a hoped-for meeting between Russia’s
  president, Vladimir Putin, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
  will not happen, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said. Speaking
  beside the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Merz said their cabinets would
  talk about the Ukraine war in light of this fact. The UK and European Union
  called in Russian envoys after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 21
  people and damaged the city’s British Council and EU offices. Four children
  were among the dead. “Our patriotism is more powerful than our fear,” Kyiv
  resident Yulia Maystruk told the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh as she stood holding
  her three-and-a-half-month-old daughter at the scene of the Darnytskyi
  apartment block bombing. She explained that she knew “a woman who had taken
  shelter in the basement with her 14-year-old-son” nearer the impact point. The
  mother had survived but was injured, needing medical care. As for the son “he
  died in hospital”, Maystruk said, her eyes welling with tears. The strikes on
  Kyiv show Russia is not interested in negotiating an end to the war, said the
  Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. “The intense attacks on Kyiv last
  night demonstrate who stands on the side of peace and who has no intention of
  believing in the negotiating path,” she said. “Our thoughts go to the
  Ukrainian people, to civilians, to the families of defenceless victims,
  including children, of the senseless Russian attacks.” Russia’s war of
  aggression on Ukraine is unlikely to end this year, Italian foreign minister
  Antonio Tajani said on Thursday, adding: “If Russia continues like this, it is
  clear there will have to be new sanctions.” The EU commission president,
  Ursula von der Leyen, said EU countries would soon come up with a 19th package
  of sanctions against Russia and were advancing work on how to use frozen
  Russian assets to help Ukraine. Hungary and Ukraine traded insults on
  Thursday, with Budapest banning a Ukrainian military commander for carrying
  out “extremely severe attacks” on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia that
  feeds Hungary. The Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said the ban
  was against the Ukrainian “commander of the military unit that carried out the
  recent extremely severe attacks against the Druzhba oil pipeline”. The
  Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, responded: “How shameless to post
  this after a brutal attack [on Kyiv] by terrorist state Russia. Peter, if the
  Russian pipeline is more important to you than the Ukrainian children killed
  by Russia this morning, this is moral decay.” Robert Brovdi, the ethnic
  Hungarian Ukrainian commander who is facing the ban, dismissed Budapest’s
  “sanctions and restrictions”, posting that “your hands are covered in
  Ukrainian blood. And we will remember that”. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he
  expects a framework for security guarantees for Ukraine to be set out as soon
  as next week. On Thursday, Zelenskyy said he had “extensively” discussed the
  topic in a call with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The head
  of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, Rustem Umerov, visited
  Turkey on Thursday to discuss the topic.
