  Let’s start with a disclaimer: today’s Rumour Mill may contain some Manchester
  United. Because, as has been the case for at least 11 years now, everyone
  knows United are just two or three signings away from being a real force –
  promise! Except, if Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe is to sanction any more incomings
  this summer, they will be very late additions, as shipping players out of Old
  Trafford is an urgent priority. Rasmus Højlund looks to be en route to Napoli
  where he will, no doubt, channel his inner Scott McTominay and emerge as
  Ballon d’Or-contending world-beater. RB Leipzig, Atalanta and Milan are also
  lurking with intent around the Dane, but Naples on a loan-with-option-to-buy
  style deal is the likeliest destination. We are all told Alejandro Garnacho
  will join Chelsea but time is running out for him to actually join Chelsea.
  Antony has long been expected to return to Real Betis, but apparently Bayern
  Munich are mulling over a shock swoop for the Brazilian. And Kobbie Mainoo is
  the latest of United’s hitherto hyped youngsters to be linked with the exit,
  with some reports claiming at least 10 clubs have been alerted to the
  midfielder’s situation. Mainoo has played zero minutes so far this season and
  is considering his next move. Away from Old Trafford, Newcastle’s pursuits of
  Yoane Wissa and Jørgen Strand Larsen continue apace, a pace possibly hastened
  by Anthony Gordon’s red card against Liverpool and forthcoming suspension.
  There’s another striker who may leave St James’ Park for the Reds before the
  window SLAMS shut on 1 September, but his name escapes us. Chelsea are finally
  shedding themselves of some unwanted talent. Unlike Jadon Sancho, Tyrique
  George doesn’t consider a switch to Roma beneath him; Axel Disasi might fancy
  Bournemouth but whether anyone fancies Raheem Sterling or Ben Chilwell remains
  to be seen. The Blues are waiting to see if RB Leipzig want Christopher Nkunku
  back and if they do, Xavi Simons will move in the opposite direction. Speaking
  of Leipzig, they could come in for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott in the next
  couple of days. Kostas Tsimikas is another heading for the Anfield exit door
  with Roma – perennially and mercifully picking up the Premier League’s old
  bits and pieces – set to land the left-back on loan. Wrexham are keen to
  further flex their muscles in the market and have reportedly opened talks with
  Rennes for Wales international Jordan James. Southampton’s Will Smallbone,
  valued at £7.5m, is also on their shopping list. Finally, where next for Jamie
  Vardy? The Red Bull-swilling snipesman remains without a club after leaving
  his beloved Leicester and, despite having been touted for Celtic (it would
  make sense), he could now be set for Serie A new boys Cremonese. The Vardy
  Party is going global! Maybe.
