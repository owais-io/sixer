  “If you want to understand Newcastle you first need to understand its place in
  the world – that is, a very long way from anywhere. The next major city is
  Leeds, two hours drive to the south … London feels very far away.” If Eddie
  Howe can only hope his prospective signings do not stumble across the Rough
  Guides introduction to England’s northern cities, Newcastle’s manager may also
  reflect that it was not supposed to be like this. The days when the club’s
  recruitment strategy was often a victim of its geographical isolation were
  supposed to have ended four years ago when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment
  Fund obtained the keys to St James’ Park. In October 2021 there was a sense of
  giddiness in the Tyneside air as Amanda Staveley, the then Newcastle director
  and minority owner who played a key role in convincing one of the world’s
  richest sovereign wealth funds to buy the club from Mike Ashley, settled back
  into a sofa at the city’s leafy Jesmond Dene House hotel and spoke of soaring
  ambition and trophies galore. Since then a series of leading players including
  Alexander Isak, Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimarães have signed for Newcastle,
  Howe’s team are in the Champions League for the second time in three years and
  are the holders of the Carabao Cup, their first domestic trophy for 70 years.
  Rather less positively, Isak is doing his utmost to force through a move to
  Liverpool, a slew of big names have turned down Howe in favour of relocating
  to London or Manchester this summer and Newcastle are seeking their third
  sporting director and second chief executive in three years. Oh and Staveley
  and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, are no longer around, after being ousted
  in a boardroom power struggle last summer. Staveley spoke subsequently of her
  “heartbreak” and “devastation” at that departure, insisting rumours of a
  planned exit were “absolute rubbish”. Thirteen months on Newcastle’s chair,
  Yasir al-Rumayyan, and the rest of the Riyadh-based Saudi ownership are
  perhaps realising that maybe she was more important to their Geordie project
  than they realised. Arguably almost everything that has subsequently gone
  wrong seems rooted in that parting of the ways. Crucially, Staveley and
  Ghodoussi were excellent communicators within a club where, at assorted
  levels, personal connections have since loosened and the Saudi ownership
  remain so remote that no representative of PIF has spoken to the UK football
  media. In contrast Staveley was big on the human touch, taking time to stop
  and chat to players, staff and, occasionally, reporters while also sending
  first-teamers regular text messages as she established rare trust with the
  instinctively wary Howe. Maybe Staveley sometimes over-promised. Isak’s
  representatives certainly believe the striker was assured his £150,000-a-week
  wages would be boosted significantly last summer and the fallout is hurting
  Howe now. Yet given that Newcastle only narrowly avoided a potential points
  deduction and heavy fine after scrambling to comply with Premier League
  spending rules within hours of a key deadline last June, the club’s decision
  to tell Isak he would have to be content with his current deal after all
  represented financial logic. Howe’s problem was that a striker who proceeded
  to score 27 goals last season remained seriously annoyed. Indeed Isak, along
  with certain similarly sulky teammates, started the campaign badly and it took
  the manager’s considerable man-management skills to talk them round. It did
  not go unnoticed that, after the Carabao Cup triumph, Isak’s body language
  turned uninterested again. Even so, the Swede had three years on his contract
  and there was a – misplaced – sense that a supposedly “laid-back” character
  would not “rock the boat”, let alone skip a pre-season tour of south east
  Asia, particularly as he was poised to be offered an improved contract this
  summer. Instead Liverpool’s interest turned the head of a striker said to be
  disappointed that there is still no sign of a much-vaunted new training ground
  at a club where a long-awaited, and much-delayed, decision as to whether
  Newcastle will revamp St James’ Park or build a new stadium has again been
  postponed. At a time when, given the constraints of profitability and
  sustainability rules, the art of selling is just as important as buying
  players, moving Isak to Liverpool for £120m-plus this month makes sense,
  permitting Howe to restock a talented but slender squad. The real puzzle is
  the lack of honest springtime conversations with Isak that might have allowed
  Newcastle to force an auction involving Liverpool, Arsenal et al before using
  their handsome profit to source an elite replacement. Instead Liam Delap, João
  Pedro, Hugo Ekitiké and now, perhaps, Benjamin Sesko have slipped through the
  net, preferring to move to London or Manchester. Newcastle, though, is not
  exactly Siberia and might have proved an easier sell had the Saudis swiftly
  appointed a successor to Darren Eales, who announced his resignation as chief
  executive 11 months ago after a blood cancer diagnosis. Eales finally seems
  about to be replaced by the Canadian former Real Madrid executive David
  Hopkinson, but Paul Mitchell’s abrupt departure “by mutual consent”, announced
  in late May, dictates that Newcastle have spent the transfer window without a
  sporting director. Mitchell, who succeeded Dan Ashworth last July, left
  without signing a player after kicking off his tenure by declaring that the
  transfer strategy was “unfit for purpose” and the manager needed “to evolve”.
  An uneasy truce with Howe eventually ensued but, less than 24 hours after
  Mitchell and the manager met Rumayyan for a post-season planning summit, his
  impending exit was announced. Throw in the enduring silence from Saudi Arabia
  and it is easy to understand why a footballer’s agent might tell his client
  that, although Howe is clearly a brilliant coach, Newcastle look a bit
  dysfunctional right now. Geography may no longer be the main reason why top
  players steer clear of Tyneside.
