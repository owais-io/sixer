  My feet have been in sandals for weeks and were ready to strip by April. I
  maintain them by filing and moisturising all winter, but a salon appointment
  is justifiable, especially if you have been inattentive. Ask your pedicurist
  to use an e-file (a fine rotating electrical file) on rough heels, dry and
  jagged cuticles, and calloused toes. I always do this: the increase in
  smoothness is significant and can be maintained with DIY filing between
  appointments. For these intervals, I use the very effective Boots Hard Skin
  Remover (£3.59) with regular soap in my weekly bath, and Glowxie’s Glass Foot
  File (£16.95; I like its palm-sized design, but any will do) for one session
  of dry filing between soaks. I never bother with at-home electrical devices.
  They’re nowhere near as effective as either an e-file or a manual file, and
  are a complete waste of cash and plastic. I trim any dried, rough outer
  cuticles on either side of my toes (never on the nail bed itself) with
  Tweezerman Rockhard Cuticle Nipper (£30), and follow with whichever oil is
  handy – cuticle oil, or even something like kitchen cupboard avocado oil works
  perfectly. In summer, I still can’t get behind pastels in my wardrobe or on my
  extremities. There’s something too bridal and conservative about lilac, beige
  and mauve, at least for my taste and colouring (pale nails make my digits look
  like rolled mortadella). Sarah Jessica Parker shares my love of bold lacquer
  in hot weather. She’s been wearing black, burgundy and dark emerald green on
  her fingers and toes throughout summer 2025, and has looked sensational.
  Personally, I’ve opted for navy, blood red and sludgy green, rarely matching
  hands and feet. Truly, I’ve never received as many compliments on my nail
  colour as I did when wearing Bio Sculpture’s Thornbird (£15.50), a deep
  Barbour jacket khaki available in traditional and gel formats. I became so
  attached to my GI Joe fingers and their fanbase that I went into my next
  pedicure appointment a month later and got the exact same shade on my toes. To
  keep everything feeling soft and looking smooth in sandals, flip-flops and
  Birks, I sleep a few times a week in gel heel socks (£6.99 for three pairs
  from Amazon). No other product offers such long-lasting efficacy for the
  price. Apply a little body cream before bed, pull on the socks, and wake to
  marshmallow-soft feet. Just quell any coital ambitions during treatment.
