  It was, she said, the day “the dream came true”. Jen Pawol, a 48-year-old
  former art teacher, made US sporting history at the weekend when she became
  the first female umpire of a Major League Baseball game during the regular
  season. Pawol, whose debut came on Saturday in a game between the Miami
  Marlins and Atlanta Braves, was given a standing ovation as she arrived on the
  pitch. Supporters held up signs reading “Pawol making HERstory” and “the time
  has come for one and all to play ball” – a nostalgic reference to A League of
  Their Own, the classic sports film about a women’s baseball league during the
  second world war. Pawol told reporters: “Wow, just incredible, the dream came
  true … the dream actually came true today.” She added: “It was pretty amazing
  when we took the field, and it seemed like quite a few people started clapping
  and saying my name, so that was pretty intense and very emotional.” Although
  MLB has had female coaches and general managers, there had, until this
  weekend, never been a female umpire in a regular season game. “I’m aware of
  the gravity. I’m aware of the magnitude,” she said, as quoted by MLB.com.
  Growing up in Long Island, New York, where baseball was always on the
  television, Pawol said she had always known she wanted that to change. “I had
  it [umpiring] in my DNA,” she has said. Pawol “begged” her parents to let her
  play baseball when she was a child. But at the time, girls played softball,
  and so she did that instead, according to a profile in The Athletic in 2023.
  Her first experience as a softball umpire came in 1990 when a friend asked her
  to work a game with her. Pawol also got a master’s degree in painting from
  Hunter College in New York and, alongside sport, worked as an art teacher. She
  had been umpiring softball for about 10 years before being invited in 2015 to
  attend a one-day MLB umpiring camp in Cincinnati. That was when she realised
  her dream of becoming a major league umpire was within reach, she said on
  Saturday. “I made a point to get there as soon as I could, to give it my best
  shot,” Pawol added. After that, she won a scholarship to MLB’s umpire academy,
  saying: “When I realised I could be a major leaguer, I just went for it.” In
  an interview with MLB.com in 2022, Pawol said she was encouraged to attend the
  one-day camp after someone told her how welcoming the MLB umpire camps were
  for women. “As soon as I heard that, I went and checked it out for myself, and
  they were right,” she said. “I think more women need to know that it’s a safe
  environment, it’s welcoming, it’s incredible. I went in 2015 … I had an
  amazing time, I felt like it was going to be a great day, and it turned out to
  be amazing and it was going to change my life, actually.” Despite the
  progress, in an interview with MLB.com in 2016, the year Pawol became
  professional, she said she was well aware of the additional scrutiny on her.
  “I can control my hustle, my calls, my professionalism. But gender and colour
  and things like that, no one can control those,” she said. “I can see why
  people are talking about it, asking those questions, because of the rarity of
  women being involved.” But the trailblazer steadily rose through the ranks and
  in 2023 became the first female umpire to reach Triple-A: the highest level of
  play in US minor league baseball. After the game on Saturday, Pawol donated
  the hat she wore to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, which she
  visited as a child. She returns to the field on Sunday, when she will stand
  behind home plate in the last match of a three-game series.
