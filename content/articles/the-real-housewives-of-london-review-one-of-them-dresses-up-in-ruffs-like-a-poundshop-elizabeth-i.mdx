  It’s taken nearly 20 years for the American reality franchise to wind its way
  across the Atlantic to the capital. In the meantime, there were pretenders and
  near-misses – Ladies of London, Real Housewives of Cheshire – but now,
  finally, west London’s ex-model community has a viable retirement plan. The
  delay seems all the more inexplicable, when you consider how to the manner
  born – if not to the manor born – these ladies are. Take Amanda, who lives in
  Belgravia, drives a Bentley convertible, runs an underperforming luxury beauty
  brand and is in a co-dependent relationship with her poodle-cum-stylist,
  Monty. Amanda has it all – clearly – and in the first episode’s first five
  minutes, she cements her status as RHOL’s Queen Bee by saying: “I’m actually a
  really private person.” Direct to camera. On a reality TV show. With a
  straight face. Now that’s a Real Housewife. It’s all about being “real”, you
  see – in the sense of being fake, but in a really committed way. The “house”
  bit also matters. Hence, we’re introduced to every cast member with a
  property-porn interiors montage (a slow-pan of the walk-in bag/shoe closet is
  the obligatory third or fourth shot). To a lesser extent, the “wife” bit is
  also important. That’s why, and no offence to the one from Wham who’s not
  George Michael, but Amanda is going to need to accrue some more impressive
  ex-husbands if she hopes to secure her top spot for many more series to come.
  I’m rooting for you, babe. We’re all rooting for you. All except RHOL’s five
  other cast members. They’re not rooting for you, Amanda. They’re perfectly
  poised to snatch the crown, should it ever slip. And, as befits a city full of
  history, some of these society girls go back. Way back. Like, all the way back
  to “when Annabel’s first opened”, which should lend a certain “heritage”
  texture to their feuding. There are two Juliets, at least one of whom rides
  horses in Hyde Park and has a husband named Tiggy. Indeed, with such aristo
  bona fides, one might think it unnecessary to further signpost your status
  ambitions by dressing up for the confessional in a royal insignia and ruffs,
  like a Poundland Elizabeth I. But perhaps this was done for the benefit of
  Juliet M’s nemesis, Panthea, whose husband, a lowly lawyer, has recently been
  made “Master of the Solicitors” as a “prestige thing” (never heard of it). In
  London, we’re told, “wealth whispers”. That’s in contrast to the outrageous
  overconsumption of OG Real Housewives like Teresa Giudice and Jen Shah – both
  convicted fraudsters – from the New Jersey and Salt Lake City shows,
  respectively. In practice, it’s investment banker turned baker Nessie wiggling
  her eyebrows suggestively, while saying things like “We were in a very …
  comfortable position, let’s say”. Or describing her husband’s line of work as
  “entrepreneur in the mining industry”, which is certainly one of the more
  transparent euphemisms for “earthly emissary from hell’s 9th circle” that I’ve
  heard lately. None of this rises to the level of the class analysis or
  psychological insight that we’ve come to expect from the franchise at its
  finest, but happily there’s still time for deeper themes to develop. And
  happily there’s also Karen, from Jamaica via Jersey, whose main function on
  the show is cracking up at the foolishness of these Englishwomen, while
  delivering teeth-kissing side-eye, as only a posh Jamaican can. With chaos
  agents like these on the guest-list, Amanda is quite right to brace for
  trouble ahead of her International Women’s Day soiree: “This loo needs to be
  checked every 15 minutes,” she tells her housekeeper sternly. “Remember.
  Because it will be carnage in there.” Ominous … But maybe Beluga caviar has
  some digestive side-effects which are well-known in society circles? Or is it
  the Ozempic? In the event, RHOL’s inaugural bust-up happens outside the
  downstairs loo, after Panthea made a toast that was 10% empty girl boss
  platitudes and 90% shady digs at Juliet. God bless Panthea, the only one
  vulgar enough to break that “wealth whispers” omertà and put a price-tag on
  her bragging. She once dropped a cool £140,000 in a single Harrods trip, she
  says, which “back then is equivalent to 300-and-something thousand”. I’ve done
  the maths, and this dates Panthea’s spree to some point in 1963 – around the
  same time private members’ club Annabel’s opened, in fact. So either they’re
  all time-travelling vampires, let loose on one of Nessie’s husband’s Hellmouth
  expeditions or – good news, girls – the botox really works! • The Real
  Housewives of London is on Hayu.
