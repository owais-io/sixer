  Australia has one of the highest levels of household debt among developed
  economies. Indeed, our collective household debt is greater than the size of
  our entire economy – at an eye-watering 112%, or more than double the European
  average. Most of that’s in our mortgages, with average home loan debt of
  nearly $670,000, but more than half of Australians also borrow on credit
  cards, and about one in eight of us take out personal and/or car loans. So
  it’s no surprise that millions of Australians breathed a sigh of relief as the
  Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates on Tuesday for the third time
  since February this year, albeit only by a quarter of a percentage point.
  While financial markets and most economists expected this latest cut as
  inflation continued to improve, the July decision not to move on rates still
  had many biting their nails. The RBA’s “dovish” tone that accompanied the May
  rate decision appears to have been a temporary blip, a reaction to global
  financial market gyrations in the wake of US President Trump’s initial tariff
  policy announcements (and re-announcements). Now, the central bank has moved
  back to the more “hawkish”, or conservative, stance that we have been used to
  for at least a year. Both upside and downside economic risks have been flagged
  with this latest decision, and growth forecasts have been nudged down, but the
  emphasis is clearly on upside risks to inflation. This is despite global
  uncertainty levels now reaching historical highs according to some
  measurements. Indeed, the RBA tells us that US tariffs are now higher than was
  expected at the time of the May decision. For many, the debate will now turn
  to the next step for interest rates. Expectations among economists are not
  aligned on this front – I’ve seen arguments against even this latest cut, with
  others expecting two more between now and February. And the RBA’s “guidance”,
  if we can call it that, is completely opaque. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  The good news for indebted Australians is that the RBA’s forecast for
  inflation over the next two years remains on track with at least two further
  rate cuts built in. The bad news is that there is “uncertainty” everywhere,
  not least in the RBA’s confidence in its forecasts, it would seem. As good as
  this news might be, amid tepid growth and uncertain consumers, perhaps the
  Australian obsession with interest rates is keeping us from having an even
  more important discussion on our economic future. Interest rates alone are not
  the potential saviour, or otherwise, of our economy. For many, that saviour is
  productivity. As one of the world’s best-known economists (if that is not a
  contradiction in terms!), Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman, famously said,
  “productivity isn’t everything but, in the long run, it is almost everything”.
  But productivity has been declining across almost all countries including
  Australia, other than the US, for a number of years now. That means our
  standard of living is also lower. Australia is no longer the “lucky country”,
  able to rely on commodities alone to pay our way. One in four Australians
  receive “most” of their income from government (and one in two receive some
  form of support), which is a sobering figure. In response, the Australian
  government will hold an Economic Reform Roundtable over three days later this
  month. The topics up for debate and discussion include all the usual suspects
  for this type of event, such as tax and budget reform, regulation,
  competition, skills, AI and innovation. However, the agenda gives each of
  these topics less than three hours each. Even with invites to participate
  scarcer than hens’ teeth, this is hardly sufficient time for breakthroughs in
  policymaking. The treasurer tells us the aim of the roundtable is to build
  “consensus on long-term economic reform, with a focus on resilience,
  productivity and budget sustainability”. Even three weeks would be unlikely to
  build consensus between policy wonks, business and unions, let alone three
  days or three hours. But that is not the point. The greater aim of this
  gabfest, perhaps, is to arouse conversations at the kitchen table, just as
  Paul Keating did in 1986, albeit in a far less subtle way, with his “banana
  republic” comment. Compared to 1986, however, when our current account deficit
  soared and our dollar sank, it’s hard to pinpoint a similar type of crisis
  that could spur widespread community support for the reforms we need to make
  our lives better. Without a bigger (but sustainable) economic pie, we are
  condemning our kids, and their kids, to worsening living standards. And that
  should be the trigger for many. That sinking feeling that consumers have every
  time they go to the supermarket, or even buy a cup of coffee, is a reflection
  of how our living standards have been shrinking over the past few years. We
  cannot keep on the same policy pathway and expect our lives to improve. Of
  course, none of this is easy, and it’s hard to focus on the country’s
  challenges when our personal challenges seem so great. But we must confront
  them if we want things to change. I have heard the treasurer say that the
  government can do big things, slowly. Shifting our focus beyond interest rates
  to the even greater economic challenges we face today, and building a
  groundswell of support for reform (beyond those with a seat at the
  roundtable), is a good place to start that process of change. • Nicki Hutley
