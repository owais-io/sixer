  More Rory McIlroy drama in Georgia. Events at the final hole of the opening
  round of the Tour Championship barely compared with what played out at Augusta
  National in April but these were still moments of McIlroy box office. No
  wonder he stood laughing with arm aloft. McIlroy found himself in a greenside
  bunker in two at the par-five 18th. He caught his attempt from the sand trap
  far too cleanly, the ball flying over the flag and rebounding from a
  grandstand. The bounce was favourable; McIlroy had 17ft left for a birdie. The
  putt found the bottom of the cup, much to the amusement of McIlroy and his
  playing partner Scottie Scheffler. McIlroy’s 66 at East Lake leaves him five
  shy of the first-round lead after Russell Henley’s stunning 61. This was a
  fine day for Keegan Bradley, were he not in the midst of the toughest choice
  of his professional career. Henley will play under Bradley for the United
  States in the Ryder Cup next month. Scheffler continued his excellent form
  with a 63, including a back half of just 31. The 64s of Patrick Cantlay,
  Collin Morikawa and Justin Thomas were notable with that trio likely to
  receive captain’s picks from Bradley. The key dilemma surrounds whether
  Bradley is also going to select himself, thereby becoming the first playing
  captain in a Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963. Bradley’s 70 here hardly
  added to the conversation. The 39-year-old did not hang around for media
  duties. Significant in this debate is what Bradley’s peers will tell him to
  do. The mood music suggests they want Bradley on this team. “Yeah, I would,”
  said Thomas when asked whether he would pick Bradley. “It is a lot [to handle
  both jobs]. I think Keegan would say the same. I don’t think he would say it’s
  easy by any means. But myself, whatever other [vice-]captains, automatic
  qualifiers have all the faith in the world that whatever he decides to do is
  going to be in the best interest of the team.” Morikawa outlined the
  trickiness of the scenario: “I think he’s got one of the most difficult
  decisions anyone has ever had to make. He has put more hours than we could
  even ask and know about into this Ryder Cup and he still has played great
  golf. He is one of the best Americans as of right now. But I truly do not know
  where his head sits and I don’t want to be in that position. “If you lose,
  every reason is going to come up. At the end of the day, we lost in Rome
  because we played bad golf and they played great golf. That’s what it comes
  down to.” There are European colours on the leaderboard. On what was a benign
  Atlanta day, with preferred lies allowed, Tommy Fleetwood and Robert MacIntyre
  joined the 64 club. Ludvig Åberg signed for a 66. “I think the course was as
  forgiving as we’re going to get it,” Fleetwood said. “But actually probably
  the biggest takeaway is how good everyone is at golf that’s here. I think the
  scoring is unbelievable. I’m sure we could talk about the fact that we had
  soft conditions and they were receptive but you’ve still got to play and
  you’ve still got to hit the shots.” It was announced on the eve of this
  tournament that Cantlay would be among players on a new committee aimed at
  reshaping the PGA Tour. Tiger Woods will chair the group. “Tiger asked me to
  be on the committee, so I said yes,” said Cantlay when asked his reasoning for
  being involved. With insight like this, what could go wrong.
