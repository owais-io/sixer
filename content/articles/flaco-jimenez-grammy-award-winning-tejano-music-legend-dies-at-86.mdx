  Flaco Jiménez, master of the accordion and pioneer of tejano music, has died
  at the age of 86. “It is with great sadness that we share tonight the loss of
  our father, Flaco Jimenez,” reads a post from his family on Facebook. “He was
  surrounded by his loved ones and will be missed immensely. Thank you to all of
  his fans and friends – those who cherished his music. And a big thank you for
  all of the memories. His legacy will live on through his music and all of his
  fans.” The cause of death is unknown but a January post from his family stated
  that he was “in the hospital facing a medical hurdle”. According to his son
  Arturo, his last words were “Ya estoy cansado”, which translates to “I’m
  tired.” Jiménez won six Grammy awards in his career, including for country
  instrumental performance and tejano music performance, and a lifetime
  achievement award in 2015. “This one, the lifetime achievement, is top of the
  line,” he said at the time. “You can’t go higher than that one.” His sound was
  instrumental in defining tejano and conjunto music. The Guardian’s Piper
  LeMoine wrote that “the soundtrack of the American south-west would be
  incomplete” without these two genres. “The way I learned to play the accordion
  was on the wild and happy side, much like Cajun and zydeco music,” he once
  said in an interview. “One of my early idols was Clifton Chenier. The way he
  played, it was like the accordion was yelling at you: hey, take this. I like
  to make my accordion yell and scream and make it happy.” After performing in
  San Antonio in the 1960s, Jiménez went to New York City and worked with
  artists including Bob Dylan, Carlos Santana, Willie Nelson and the Rolling
  Stones. His first solo album was released in 1972 and he would go on to record
  more than 25 in his career. A tribute was paid by Cesar Rosas, a member of Los
  Lobos who worked with Jiménez on the song Don’t Worry Baby. “Not only was
  Flaco my musical mentor, but he was also a dear friend to all of us Los
  Lobos,” Rosas said to the San Antonio Express-News. “He was such a musical
  influence on me that [he] made me run out and buy a bajo sexto and start using
  it in my band. He will forever be in my heart. What a tremendous loss.”
