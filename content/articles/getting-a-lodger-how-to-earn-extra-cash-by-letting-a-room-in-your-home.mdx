  What is a lodger? Technically, a lodger is different to a tenant. A lodger is
  someone who rents a room in someone else’s home, usually sharing living spaces
  such as the kitchen and bathroom. By contrast, tenants generally rent the
  whole property. Unlike a tenant, a lodger does not have exclusive rights to
  any part of the property – meaning you, as the landlord, can access their room
  (however, you should respect their privacy). Matt Hutchinson, a director at
  the flatshare website SpareRoom, says tenants generally have more rights than
  lodgers because the law recognises that homeowners and landlords are distinct
  roles, and sharing a home “requires a different set of rules”. He adds:
  “Homeowners who rent out (always furnished) rooms to lodgers do so under a
  licence rather than a tenancy agreement, which sets out the conditions of
  their stay in your property. “For example, you’re only required to serve
  ‘reasonable’ notice if you want your lodger to move out. That’s usually the
  length of the rental payment period, so typically one month, but it can be
  shorter. There’s also no minimum term required by either party.” Live-in
  landlords can ask lodgers for a deposit. But unlike a residential landlord
  letting an entire property on an assured shorthold tenancy (AST), there is no
  obligation to protect the deposit using a deposit protection scheme. Who can
  take in one? Most homeowners can take in a lodger, but if you have a mortgage,
  it is best to speak to your lender first. Mark Harris, the chief executive of
  the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says: “Even those lenders who don’t
  have an issue with lodgers may have certain caveats, such as a cap on the
  number of lodgers. Principality [building society] will only allow one, while
  Nationwide and Santander will allow up to two lodgers. Some lenders will
  forbid lodgers altogether.” Bear in mind that if you let rooms to more than
  two people, your property may then be classed as a “house in multiple
  occupation” (HMO) by your local authority. There are extra safety requirements
  and standards for HMOs, and you will often need a licence. If your home is
  leasehold, check the lease to see whether you need the freeholder’s permission
  to sublet part of the property. Council tenants can also sublet a room to a
  lodger, assuming the local authority gives the go-ahead. Private tenants can
  take someone in, too, as long as they have their landlord’s permission. Find
  the right person SpareRoom is the go-to site for lodgers and flatmates. As
  well as advertising your room, check the “room wanted” ads and sign up for
  alerts, so you will be aware of anyone looking in your area. Other websites
  worth checking out include Roomies UK and Ideal Flatmate, while MondaytoFriday
  and GetDigs UK specialise in weekday lets. Use word of mouth, too: ask
  friends, family or colleagues whether they know someone looking for a room.
  There is social media too: local Facebook groups are a good place to start.
  Earn up to £7,500 tax-free The government’s “rent a room” scheme lets you earn
  up to £7,500 a year (£625 a month) tax-free from letting out furnished
  accommodation in your home. The threshold is halved to £3,750 if you share the
  income with someone else. Most live-in landlords include bills in the rent. To
  determine how much rent to charge, research local market rates for similar
  rooms and adjust based on your specific circumstances. Consider factors such
  as the size and condition of the room, shared living spaces and the location.
  The income limit covers everything you charge your lodger – so if you charge
  them for cleaning, meals or laundry, you will need to count these fees or
  costs too. You do not need to do anything unless you earn above the threshold
  – in which case you will need to pay income tax on the amount above £7,500.
  “The tax-free threshold hasn’t been increased since 2016 and is no longer
  representative of average room rents today,” says Hutchinson. “This means many
  people who rent out rooms earn more than the threshold. If they do, they must
  opt into the scheme and complete a tax return to claim their tax-free
  allowance.” Do your homework When choosing someone to share your home with, it
  is important to check you are compatible. A quick chat will help you decide if
  someone’s lifestyle and personality fit with yours. Ask about working hours
  (including whether they work from home), smoking, pets, regular guests,
  cleaning habits and expectations. If you are in England, once you have found a
  potential lodger, you need to do a “right to rent” check to make sure they are
  legally allowed to live in the country. You can be fined or sent to prison for
  failing to carry out this check. To do this, you should ask to see relevant
  documents. There is an online guide that can help with this process. You may
  also want to carry out credit checks and ask for references before signing an
  agreement. Make an agreement A “lodger agreement” – or “licence to occupy” –
  is used by live-in landlords to rent out a spare room in their home. This is a
  different type of contract to an AST, which is what you would use if you let
  the entire property to tenants. You can include various terms in the lodger
  agreement, such as about rules on overnight guests and noise, cleaning
  responsibilities and use of common areas. Having everything in writing at the
  beginning can avoid disputes later on. The agreement should also set out the
  rent amount, payment frequency, how it should be paid (for example, by
  standing order) and any notice period required. Consider your finances If you
  are claiming benefits and take in a lodger, you must inform the Department for
  Work and Pensions at your local jobcentre immediately. Taking in a lodger can
  affect your benefit entitlements, and failing to report this change can lead
  to overpayments, penalties or even prosecution for fraud. If you normally get
  the 25% single-person discount on your council tax, this will end when a
  lodger moves in. However, if the lodger is a full-time student, the discount
  may still apply. Tell your home insurer Make sure your tell your buildings and
  contents insurer about your lodger, as failing to do so can invalidate your
  policy. You may need a home insurance policy that includes cover for lodgers,
  or you may have to pay an extra premium on your current policy. Your insurer
  may also add exclusions to your cover – such as theft if there is no forced
  entry. You will need to check with your provider whether the policy will cover
  your lodger’s possessions, or if they need to take out their own contents
  policy. Set up the room If you use the “rent a room” scheme to earn tax-free
  income, you must provide your lodger with a furnished room. This means
  providing a bed and mattress, wardrobe or other storage, and a desk or table
  if there is space. You will also need to ensure the room meets fire safety
  standards, such as having working smoke alarms, fire-safe furnishings and
  proper ventilation. You will need to comply with gas safety regulations, too.
  This means your gas appliances must be checked every year by a Gas Safe
  registered engineer. On moving-in day It’s helpful to be around when your
  lodger moves in – do not just hand over the keys and disappear. They could
  have questions, so being available makes settling in smoother. Of course, you
  do not need to hover while they unpack, but make sure they know where to find
  you if they need anything.
