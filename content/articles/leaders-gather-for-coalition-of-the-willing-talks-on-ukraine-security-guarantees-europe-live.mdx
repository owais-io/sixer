  Rutte says that despite adopting more ambitious spending targets earlier this
  year, “cash alone can’t provide security.” He goes on: “We need the
  capabilities, real firepower, heavy metal, as well as new tech, and that’s
  what our defence industry across the Alliance needs to deliver faster than
  ever in Europe and also in the United States. Simply all over the Alliance, we
  are not producing enough.” But he says “we are already turning the tide on
  defence production, and particularly when it comes to ammunition,” paying
  particular tribute to Czech Republic. “We are gradually refilling our stocks
  and narrowing the production gap with Russia,” he says. Nato’s secretary
  general Mark Rutte is speaking at the IISS Prague Defence Summit now. He says
  he wants to talk about the need to increase European military capabilities to
  keep the continent safe. He says Europe needs to respond to “Russia and China
  investing heavily to build up and modernise their militaries” at “a
  remarkable, I might say, at a staggering rate.” He says this equipment is
  being used against Ukraine, and while the alliance is “working to end this
  aggression as quickly as possible,” Europe should not be naive about the
  future. “This trend is not going to shift or reverse anytime soon. Russia is
  and for the foreseeable future, will remain, a destabilising and
  confrontational force in Europe and the world,” he says. The so-called
  Coalition of the Willing is meeting today in Paris and online for further
  talks on security guarantees for Ukraine in case of a peace deal with Russia.
  Hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a group of mostly European
  leaders – including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy – will discuss how to turn
  their will to help Ukraine into concrete, specific guarantees that would give
  Ukraine the confidence that any peace arrangement with Russia could hold.
  Welcoming Zelenskyy last night, Macron announced that, after months of work by
  military planners, Europe was finally ready to provide the guarantees and
  would politically endorse their plan at the meeting today. Let’s see what it
  entails. The leaders start arriving around 9am BST, 10am CEST for talks among
  themselves, before holding a call with US president Donald Trump at 1pm
  BST/2pm CEST. We will hear what they agreed on an hour later. For what it’s
  worth, Trump declared last night that he had been thinking about organising a
  face-to-face meeting between Zelenskyy and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, but did
  not commit to any specific action. “Something is going to happen, but they are
  not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done,”
  he told CBS. Earlier, he told reporters at a meeting with the Polish
  president, Karol Nawrocki, that Putin would have to make a decision on next
  steps and “if we are unhappy about it, you will see things happen”. Whatever
  that means. Let’s see what the day brings us. I will bring you all the key
  updates here. It’s Thursday, 4 September 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this
  is Europe Live. Good morning.
