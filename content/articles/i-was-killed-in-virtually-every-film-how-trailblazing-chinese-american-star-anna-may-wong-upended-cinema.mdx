  Anna May Wong is everywhere these days. The chic Chinese-American actor who
  first made a splash in the silent era has been fictionalised in films and TV
  shows, including Ryan Murphy’s Hollywood and Damien Chazelle’s Babylon, and an
  excellent novel, Amanda Lee Koe’s Delayed Rays of a Star. She has her face on
  the quarter, the first Asian-American to be honoured in that way, and she is
  the subject of a page-turner of a biography, Not Your China Doll by Katie Gee
  Salisbury. But what about the films? This month, BFI Southbank in London hosts
  a retrospective of this remarkable star’s career, titled Anna May Wong: the
  Art of Reinvention. Wong was born in Los Angeles to second-generation Chinese
  parents in 1905. At the very beginning of her film career in 1921, she
  self-consciously told a movie magazine that she was “a considerable spot of
  yellow that’s come to stay on the silver of the screen”, announcing her
  difference as a rare Asian-American leading lady and her determination to
  become a star in the same breath. As her career continued, she would become
  more outspoken about the challenges of typecasting and her disappointment with
  the representation of Chinese characters on screen. “I was killed in virtually
  every picture I appeared in. Pathetic dying seemed to be the best thing I
  did,” she said. She never got the career she deserved, banned from playing
  romantic leading roles where she would kiss a white co-star, and passed over
  for Chinese roles in favour of white actors in yellowface. “She was forced to
  reinvent herself at different points of her career,” says season curator Xin
  Peng, assistant professor in film and screen studies at the University of
  Cambridge. “She didn’t have the option to repeat what she was doing, or retire
  in luxury.” The season traces Wong’s career from her first leading role in
  early Technicolor silent The Toll of the Sea (1922) through to her last film
  appearance in the Lana Turner vehicle Portrait in Black (1960) – plus, Flower
  Drum Song, the spectacular musical she was preparing to star in when she died
  in 1961. “By watching those films, we can imagine the kind of alternative
  futures that she may have had,” says Peng. There is plenty in the season to
  show how impressive Wong was on screen, charismatic even in small roles in
  silent fantasy The Thief of Bagdad (1924) starring Douglas Fairbanks, or Peter
  Pan (1924), beautifully shot by Chinese-American cinematographer James Wong
  Howe. Not to mention the unforgettable Shanghai Express (1932) where she
  shares a railway compartment and a worldly glamour with Marlene Dietrich.
  “They put Wong in the background, but I’m not sure she’s very good at staying
  there,” says Peng. “The Thief of Bagdad is exemplary of Wong’s ability to
  steal the show, because even with the most fleeting appearance, she was able
  to shift your attention from any of the stars. You wonder: ‘Who’s that?’” In
  search of better roles, Wong went to Europe, where she made two beautiful
  silent melodramas in Germany and another in the UK: Piccadilly (1929), a
  romance set in multicultural London, with a screenplay by Arnold Bennett. She
  was particularly warmly received in the UK, at least at first, after her
  struggles for recognition in Hollywood. In Piccadilly, director EA Dupont
  filmed a kiss between Wong and her white leading man, Jameson Thomas, which
  was cut before release against the director’s wishes. In 1930’s Hai-Tang, an
  early talkie filmed in English, French and German, once again her kiss, with
  John Longden, was cut for British audiences. Not until 1934’s Java Head would
  Wong break that taboo, kissing John Loder on screen – a landmark for British
  cinema. Wong did return to Hollywood in the 1930s, for Shanghai Express and
  plenty more besides. These films are something of a rollercoaster. Daughter of
  the Dragon (1931), in which Wong gets top billing, nevertheless contains a
  collection of orientalist stereotypes, with Wong playing the vengeful child of
  Fu Manchu. Bizarrely, Wong plays opposite Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa and
  Swedish Warner Oland, all three playing Chinese characters. Wong finally
  visited China in 1936, where she was roundly criticised for her portrayals of
  Chinese villains and stereotypes in foreign films. On her return, she
  determined to take charge of her career. In B-movies such as Daughter of
  Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939), she was able to play characters
  with more control over their destiny, and formed Hollywood cinema’s first
  Asian-American screen couple, with her childhood friend Philip Ahn, a
  Korean-American actor and activist. In the Edgar Wallace adaptation Dangerous
  to Know (1938), Wong revives a role she played to great acclaim on stage.
  Although Wong plays the marginal role of the gangster’s mistress, the climax
  of the film contains one of her greatest moments on screen. “It’s the most
  spectacular ending, with a virtuosic performance from Wong, and that
  performance was possible because of her life experience, her whole career of
  being typecast in a certain character with a certain fate,” says Peng. “I was
  completely shocked when I first watched the film.” Wong has many such
  arresting scenes. Even when playing hackneyed characters, she strikes a bold,
  modern tone. Following the strange course of her career across these films
  tells a remarkable story of a woman with a powerful talent, who indeed made
  her mark on the silver screen – as both a brilliant actor, and a trailblazer
  in an often hostile industry. • Anna May Wong: The Art of Reinvention is at
  BFI Southbank, London, until 6 October
