  Storm Floris is forecast to bring unseasonably strong winds to the UK on
  Monday, the Met Office has said. The strongest winds are expected during the
  afternoon and night across Scotland, with gusts of up to 85mph possible on
  exposed coasts and hills. A yellow weather warning for wind is in place in
  Scotland, Northern Ireland, north Wales and the north of England from 6am on
  Monday to 6am on Tuesday. Heavy rain is also expected, with predictions of
  transport disruption. Many inland parts of the area were likely to have
  westerly gusts of 40 to 50mph and on exposed coasts and high ground they could
  reach 70mph, forecasters warned. The strongest winds would most likely affect
  Scotland on Monday afternoon and night, but “there remains some uncertainty in
  the depth and track of Floris”, the Met Office said. “Winds will first ease in
  the west during later Monday but remaining very strong overnight until early
  Tuesday in the east. Heavy rain may also contribute to the disruption in
  places.” Flying debris may cause injuries and pose a danger to life, as could
  “large waves and beach material being thrown on to sea fronts, coastal roads
  and properties”, the Met Office added. It is possible tiles will be blown from
  roofs and there may be power cuts. The weather could also disrupt road, rail,
  air and ferry services, and close roads and bridges. Storm Floris is the sixth
  named storm of the 2024-25 naming season, which runs from early September to
  late August, and January’s Storm Éowyn was the most recent. Named storms are
  more frequent in late autumn and winter – but are “not uncommon” for summer,
  the Met Office said. A yellow weather warning can mean an impact from the
  weather is likely, but relatively low-level – or that any impact is relatively
  unlikely, but disruption would be more severe were it to occur. There are no
  weather warnings in place anywhere in the UK before Monday. Forecasters have
  said Friday is likely to bring some showers, but those will have dissipated by
  the evening – leaving fine weather for many. Saturday is also expected to be
  dry “with plenty of sunshine and generally small amounts of cloud. Feeling
  warm in the sunshine with light winds, though a little breezy in some coastal
  areas”. Sunday is expected to be breezier, with rain clearing to sunnier skies
  later as the nation braces for the storm to come. Last month was the UK’s
  fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met
  Office. The first day of July brought the hottest temperature of the year so
  far, with 35.8C measured in Faversham in Kent, and two separate heatwaves
  affected much of the UK in the first half of the month. All UK nations
  recorded one of their top 10 warmest Julys: Scotland and Northern Ireland had
  their sixth warmest, England its seventh and Wales its tenth.
