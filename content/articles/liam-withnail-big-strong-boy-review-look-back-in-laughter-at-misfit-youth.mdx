  There’s trauma comedy, finding laughter in the very worst moments of our
  lives. But there’s space too for quite-a-sticky-period comedy, a notch down on
  the scale of bad stuff that happens, but no less significant in the lives of
  those lucky enough to keep actual trauma at bay. That’s Liam Withnail’s mode
  in Big Strong Boy, which, from a vantage point of modest career success in his
  mid-30s, revisits a mild crisis weathered half a lifetime ago. In his
  unassuming hands, it takes the shape of a lovely story about misfit
  adolescence, family love, the guilt we carry – and redemption. Now resident in
  Edinburgh, Withnail transports us back to his youth in Dagenham, the support
  of whose tourist board he is unlikely be currying. In a town where, at least
  back then, homophobic abuse would follow on the slightest deviation from
  sartorial norm, young Liam does not fit in. He tries and fails to have a love
  affair with his “indie sleaze” soulmate. With his brother, he steals his dad’s
  Guinness, aged only seven, triggering a precocious alcohol habit. It spirals,
  he gets depressed, Dagenham starts feeling less dead end, more death sentence.
  Notwithstanding the volume of booze consumed, Withnail knows this is dramatic
  small beer. But it means a lot to him, to his mum, with her addiction to ALL
  CAPS text messages, and to his “leprechaun” dad. In an artfully structured
  show, directed by Jet Vevers, Withnail reconsiders this period in response to
  the question “Are you happy?”, which catches him cold. Was he then? Is he now?
  One of the story’s key players resurfaces in the present day, helping absolve
  our host’s guilt and make peace with the unwise teenager he once was. A churl
  may argue that the show’s charge by this point is more sentimental than comic.
  For my money, Withnail gets the balance right. Fine jokes about Grenade
  protein bars, generational reactions to comedy, and his parents’ indulgent
  child-rearing style keep the heart light in this tale of a teenager in panic,
  and his adult self letting him off the hook. At Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh,
  until 24 August. Then touring from 4 October. All our Edinburgh festival
