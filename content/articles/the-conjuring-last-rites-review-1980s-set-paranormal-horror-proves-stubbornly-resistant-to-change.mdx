  The Conjuring: Last Rites review – 1980s-set paranormal horror proves
  stubbornly resistant to change

  The first Conjuring, released in 2013, was a profitable hangover from the
  previous decade’s Omen, Amityville and Exorcist retreads, goosing 21st-century
  audiences with things-going-bump-in-the-night tricks copped from comparable
  1970s theatrical and TV movies. Yet despite sequels that went big (2016’s The
  Conjuring 2, converting the Enfield poltergeist saga into a 4DX-ready
  theme-park ride) and then sideways (2021’s true crime-adjacent The Devil Made
  Me Do It), the series’ underlying mechanics have proved stubbornly resistant
  to change. The current multifaceted horror renaissance makes this an apt
  moment for the franchise to exit stage right; facing these upstart punks, the
  generally sluggish Last Rites presents as something akin to dad-rock horror,
  doing with jump-scares what Status Quo used to do with power chords. One
  selling point – that these films are character- rather than carnage-driven –
  now seems to be a liability. After a nicely cast prologue describing their
  days as young parents, Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera
  Farmiga) are reintroduced in 1986, when the film positions these middle-aged
  squares as yesterday’s exorcists, heckled by students who would rather talk
  Ghostbusters, in the way today’s cinemagoers will emerge discussing Weapons or
  Sinners. They head for a Pennsylvanian household whose antique mirror doubles
  as a portal to hell, but ithere are 75 minutes of beigey soap before the usual
  satanic hokey-cokey kicks off, forcing us to consider the threat Armageddon
  poses to the forthcoming nuptials of the Warrens’ daughter Judy (Mia
  Tomlinson). The squareness may be the point: the Warrens have become
  reassuring touchstones for folks who don’t want their horror too messed-up.
  Within its own narrow parameters as a delivery system for bland guignol, Last
  Rites may meet that core audience’s specifications. Wilson and Farmiga remain
  solidity incarnate, capable of enlivening even speculative spiritual dialogue.
  The film-making pulls no surprises out of the hat, though, and gives no
  indication that it would if it could. There’s another creepy doll, demonic
  makeup from the Linda Blair Fall ’73 range, and an ascent of a darkened
  staircase – but the floorboards have never seemed creakier. Last Rites has
  Howard Jones on the soundtrack and still feels obdurately Victorian. • The
  Conjuring: Last Rites is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.
