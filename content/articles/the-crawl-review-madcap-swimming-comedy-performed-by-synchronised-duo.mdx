webTitle: The Crawl review – madcap swimming comedy performed by synchronised duo
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-24T09:45:25Z'
bodyText: >-
  This highly physical comedy about two competitive swimmers begins at the
  beginning – not with a referee’s whistle but a stand-alone aquatic opus racing
  through humans’ evolution from fish. In caps, goggles and bathing suits,
  Alexander Burnett and Ellie Whittaker recount our abiding passion for the
  water, from the earliest forms of life to Napoleon diving into an especially
  wet misremembering of Waterloo, and on to an amusing pitch for The Great
  British Swim-Off. It’s a supremely silly sequence that could even withstand a
  few more laps of absurdity. The show’s focus, though, is on two contestants
  going head to head: Meeta (Burnett), drilled for competition since birth, and
  Steve (Whittaker), rehabilitated from a wayward youth by a newfound love of
  swimming. (He still has an over-developed right arm from throwing stones.)
  Meeta emits discipline and icy focus; have-a-go Steve is a bag of nerves,
  goggle-eyed even without the swim glasses. In a nice touch, Burnett and
  Whittaker are competitive with each other about how this story will be told
  and they also play overly fussy, antagonistic race organisers and buffoonish
  commentators. As for the other competitors, coaches, lifeguards and so on –
  they are all played by us, thanks to the most affably handled audience
  participation I’ve seen this fringe. With bombastic music from Andrés
  Hernandez, Olivia Zerphy’s production never treads water and the limber,
  Lecoq-trained performers are suitably synchronised. Who needs props when they
  can play gym equipment, a library or a glacier themselves? This is a genially
  amusing hour, never quite reaching hysterical heights, but with plenty of
  clever, goofy touches and a wide appeal (it’s for over-eights) even if the
  moral could probably be elucidated for younger audiences. The story grows
  surprisingly sweet and shows there’s more than one way to win in life. At
  Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
