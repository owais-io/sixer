  Vice-president JD Vance’s attempt to deflect attention away from the Trump
  administration’s handling of the case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey
  Epstein has backfired, triggering renewed calls for transparency. In an
  interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday, Vance tried to brush off
  criticism of the administration’s refusal to release documents related to the
  scandal, accusing Joe Biden of doing “absolutely nothing” about it when he was
  in the White House. Within minutes of the Fox News interview being broadcast,
  social media began to hum with renewed cries of “release the files!” The White
  House has been caught in a bind over the Epstein affair, which spawned
  conspiracy theories among many of Donald Trump’s supporters which now senior
  figures in the administration had actively encouraged during the 2024
  campaign. Here are the key US politics stories at a glance: Vance’s attempt to
  link Democrats to Epstein renews calls to ‘release the files’ Four days after
  JD Vance reportedly asked top Trump administration officials to come up with a
  new communications strategy for dealing with the scandal around the disgraced
  financier Jeffrey Epstein, the vice-president appears to have put his foot in
  it, sparking a new round of online outrage even as he tried to defuse the
  furor. Read the full story Nvidia and AMD reportedly agree to pay 15% of China
  chip sale revenues to US Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government

  Times reported on Sunday. Read the full story Texas redistricting fight ‘could

  literally last years”. Read the full story Court overrides Trump officials’

  golf course to leave Washington DC In a social media post on Sunday, the
  president demanded homeless residents of Washington DC leave the country’s
  capital or face eviction, and again promised to use federal officers to jail
  criminals, even though violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low when he
  took office in January. Read the full story Companies aiding Trump’s
  immigration crackdown see ‘extraordinary’ revenues The technology,
  surveillance and private prison providers arming Trump’s massive expansion and
  weaponization of immigration enforcement are running a victory lap after

  happened today: Ahead of the a meeting between president Donald Trump and
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin scheduled for Friday, our correspondent Shaun
  Walker has written this analysis about how confusion over the summit shows
  Putin still calls the shots. Trump’s second term has seen a sustained assault
  on democratic institutions – political, judicial, media, cultural and academic
  – that appears to be only accelerating, writes David Smith in this feature.
