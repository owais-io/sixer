  Rachel Reeves should bring in wealth taxes at the autumn budget to deliver the
  change promised by Labour at the election and battle the rising threat from
  Reform, the UK’s most senior union chief has said. Paul Nowak, general
  secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), urged the chancellor to “stay
  the course” on her plans to invest in the country, adding that the government
  should not be afraid of adopting “a little bit” of economic leftwing populism.
  Ahead of the TUC’s annual gathering this weekend, he called Nigel Farage an
  “absolute political opportunist” who could be challenged by Labour
  demonstrating that it was genuinely on the side of working people, through
  better employment rights and a fairer tax system. In an interview with the
  Guardian, Nowak said: “It is clear that we need long-term fixes, and so the
  chancellor has to be prepared to look at tax. We think that there’s a public
  mood out there for a grown up conversation about what that means. And the
  crucial thing is that those with the broader shoulders are asked to pay a
  fairer share.” Polling for the TUC found that a 2% annual wealth tax paid by
  individuals with assets worth more than £10m would be supported by 68% of
  people, with 22% against. This rose to 75% among 2024 Labour voters now
  leaning towards Reform. The poll also found that increasing capital gains tax
  to the same level as income tax was supported by 51% of people, with 34%
  against. This rose to 57% among Labour backers now tempted to vote for
  Farage’s party. There was even greater support for a package of tax rises
  including wealth taxes, higher taxes on gambling firms and a windfall tax on
  the profits of banks and other financial institutions, with 68% supporting the
  proposals as a whole, while just 23% opposed to them. The TUC calculated that
  the wealth taxes could raise an extra £36bn a year, while a gambling tax could
  bring in £3bn more and a bank surcharge could raise between £20bn and £50bn
  over the next four years depending on the level it was set at, between 16% and
  35%. “The government’s got to stay the course. A little bit of economic
  left-wing populism would go a long way, because clearly that’s where the
  public mood is. On tax, on workers rights, people want to see change,” Nowak
  said. “For far too many people, ‘change’ still feels like a slogan and not
  actually their lived reality. They’re still in the midst of a cost of living
  crisis. They still haven’t seen the improvements come through in public
  services. “Every decision the government takes to demonstrate it’s on the side
  of working people is the right thing to do … No one thought the economy was
  going to be fixed overnight. But the worst thing the chancellor could do,
  having made that big upfront investment in the budget last year, is to pull
  back from that. “I don’t think the balance is right at the moment. I think
  we’ve got a tax system that’s very good at taxing work, less effective at
  taxing wealth. That’s really the big inequality that we’ve seen opening up.
  “That doesn’t take away from the fact we know we need to get growth into the
  economy, growth that makes a difference in people’s pockets. But this budget,
  if the choice is between fair taxes and cuts to the public services, we know
  whose side the chancellor should be on.” Nowak, who has previously called
  Farage a “political fraud and hypocrite” who was “cosplaying” as a
  working-class champion in order to win votes, doubled down on his view that
  the Reform UK leader was a political opportunist. “Nigel Farage is, as always,
  talking up whose side he is on. [But] he’s a political snake oil salesman. The
  gap between the rhetoric and what he’s actually prepared to deliver is
  massive. We have got a job to do, to show the gap between the rhetoric and
  reality,” he said. “The way that we challenge Reform, and the way that a
  Labour government challenges it, is by demonstrating that they genuinely are
  on the side of working people.” However, in a warning to the left, he said:
  “Frankly, I don’t think the alternative is Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. It’s Nigel
  Farage or Kemi Badenoch in No 10. And that should fill anybody who cares about
  the rights of working people, about our public services with absolute dread.”
