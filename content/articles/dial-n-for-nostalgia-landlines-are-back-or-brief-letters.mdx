  Emma Brockes’ article threw open the door to landline memories (Worried about
  your child’s screentime? Get a landline, 31 July). When it rang, the
  enthusiasm that came with the conviction “it’s for me” v the reluctance when
  seemingly knowing “it’s not for me”. This was undoubtedly because the phone in
  a cold hallway meant no one wanted to leave the warmth and TV in the sitting
  room. Virginia Ranscombe Derbyhaven, Isle of Man • I can’t believe it has
  taken 40 years and a thinktank to realise the bleeding obvious about the sale
  of council housing (Right to buy in England ‘fuelled housing crisis and cost
  taxpayers £200bn’, 3 August). Wrong policy from the very beginning – and the
  fact it continued for so long is nothing short of scandalous. Margaret
  Vandecasteele Cupar, Fife • Moving away from cremation and biodegradable
  burial (Letters, 30 July), why aren’t more people donating their bodies to
  medical research? There is a national shortage at present. No miserable
  funeral, but if your nearest and dearest want to have a get together to
  recognise your life, they can. And that’s free. Dr Derek Middlemiss
  Collingham, Nottinghamshire • RIP Tom Lehrer (Obituary, 29 July). Still
  crazily prophetic after all these years: “When the air becomes uraneous / We
  will all go simultaneous” (We Will All Go Together When We Go, 1958). Noel
  Hess London • Songs by actors ranked (31 July) and no Lee Marvin with
  Wand’rin’ Star. Shame! Andrew Bailey Gresford, Wrexham • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
