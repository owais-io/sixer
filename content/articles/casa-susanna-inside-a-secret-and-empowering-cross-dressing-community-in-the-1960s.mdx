  A new show at the Met demonstrates the enduring power of photography to affirm
  trans identities and build trans communities. Titled simply Casa Susanna, it
  reveals a treasure trove of photographs made by a community of self-identified
  “cross-dressers” in the 1960s, as they found ways to make precious time to
  dress as their feminine selves in two resorts offering safe spaces in the
  Catskill mountains. According to show curator Mia Fineman, these photos had
  sat dormant for decades until two antique dealers happened to discover them at
  a flea market in 2004. “What struck them was that they were men dressed in
  women’s clothing but not in drag,” said Fineman. “They were not wearing
  flamboyant clothing, it was a very conservative, midcentury style.” The photos
  were acquired by the Art Gallery of Ontario, a book of the photographs was
  released, and subsequently trans scholars began to situate Casa Susanna into
  queer history. The original flea market collection of photos was also
  augmented by collections from artist Cindy Sherman and Betsy Wollheim, a
  daughter of one of the members of the original Casa Susanna community, and AGO
  launched a formal exhibition of the photos in the winter of 2024. Now the Met
  shares its own version of this show, featuring some 160 photos as well as
  material from Transvestia, a zine made by the Casa Susanna community that
  published six issues per year. It is a tender and necessary look at trans
  identity from over half a century ago. Casa Susanna was the brainchild of two
  women: trans woman Susanna Valenti and her wife Marie Tornell. According to
  Fineman, the two came together over a meet-cute for the ages: one day a
  nervous Valenti – dressed as a man – came into Tornell’s Manhattan wig shop,
  supposedly to purchase a wig for her sister, but the astute shopowner was
  having none of it. “Marie clocked Susanna, said I know it’s for you, it’s ok,
  let me find something that will make you look beautiful. After that the two of
  them quickly fell in love.” The couple subsequently decided to create a
  dedicated place where others like Valenti could have the space to be their
  true selves. “The two of them as a couple were so extraordinary and unique for
  their time,” said Fineman. “I really wish I could have met them, they seem
  like such incredible people.” In the 60s, very few people who wished to author
  the story of their own gender were able to have Valenti’s freedom. McCarthyism
  was rampant, and most of the Casa Susanna community supported families as
  married men – if others found out that they liked to dress as women, they
  stood to lose everything. “Most of these people were married, were
  professionals, doctors, lawyers, mechanics,” said Fineman. “They were mostly
  white middle class men with wives and families. They had a lot to lose if
  their cross-dressing were to be exposed. They lived in isolation and shame.”
  Casa Susanna participants went so far as to learn to process and print color
  film on their own, in order to avoid having their photos seen by consumer
  labs. In spite of that intense pressure – or maybe because of it – those
  depicted in the Casa Susanna photos radiate intense levity and happiness.
  “There’s a real sense of joy, a feeling of being so comfortable in their
  skin,” said Fineman. “When they were in women’s clothing and in the safe space
  that these resorts provided them they had a sense of freedom there that they
  couldn’t have in their everyday lives.” These photos are striking for how
  closely they resemble photographs shared decades later by early stage trans
  women in Internet-based communities. There is a similar aspirational desire to
  embody an ideal of middle-class, white femininity, and a sense of playful,
  stolen moments, an all-too brief respite of freedom, self-expression, and
  community, against a smothering life of forced conformity to a gender that
  they know is wrong. Heartbreakingly, these photos show a stage of arrested
  development, a time when so many closeted trans women were unable to stop
  living a dual life as straight men. Behind all the smiles and casual poses one
  can sense individuals who yearn to be free but do not feel capable of pushing
  past the barriers imposed by society. “Seeing photos of themselves dressed en
  femme was profoundly important for these people,” said Fineman. “They talked
  about this in the magazine and in other places. It was seeing an image of
  themselves as a woman that reflected back their desired identity to them.”
  Importantly, Casa Susanna puts the lie to the frequent myth that there is
  something new about trans women, as well as the falsehood recently perpetrated
  by supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett that the US has no significant
  history of discrimination against trans people. “At the time there were
  masquerade laws, so these people could be arrested for cross-dressing in
  public,” said Fineman. “They had to be very careful, even going outside of
  their homes. There are accounts in the magazine of them being arrested, which
  involved horrible humiliation and mistreatment at the hands of the police.
  They could even be sent to mental institutions for what was essentially
  conversion therapy.” Many in the Casa Susanna community had supportive wives
  who would often join them in the Catskills, sometimes even penning columns in
  Transvestia from their perspective. In 1965, one wife named Avis wrote a
  heartfelt column on her struggles to understand her spouse’s identity, giving
  some sense of the depth of commitment of those who participated there. “Wives
  would come with them to these retreats and help them create their look,” said
  Fineman. “One picture that I really love that shows a couple wearing matching
  dresses that they obviously had had made. That was something really
  surprising.” Some members of the Casa Susanna community, such as Virginia
  Prince, founder and editor of Transvestia, eventually transitioned to a woman
  – she lived openly as herself from 1968 until her death in 2009. Some of these
  women still survive to this day, and several will be present at the Met for a
  panel in September. The museum will also host a screening of the 2022 PBS
  documentary Casa Susanna, directed by Sébastien Lifshitz. Fineman sees this
  exhibition as a gesture of inclusion to the trans community, as well as a way
  of making good the history that has been lost. Museums have a particular role
  to play, particularly now when so many other sectors of society are actively
  erasing trans lives. “I hope this offers trans people a larger sense of
  affirmation and understanding,” she said. “We have a role to make these
  pictures and history visible.” Casa Susanna is on display at the Met in New
  York until 25 January 2026
