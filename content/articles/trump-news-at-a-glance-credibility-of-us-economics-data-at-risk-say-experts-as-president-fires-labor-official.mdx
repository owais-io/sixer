  After Donald Trump ordered the firing of a federal government official in
  charge of labor statistics, experts and opposition politicians have expressed
  alarm that the “credibility” of US economic data was at risk. The US president
  claimed without evidence that Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor
  statistics, had “rigged” job numbers “in order to make the Republicans, and
  ME, look bad”, after data showed jobs growth stalled this summer, prompting
  accusations that the president was “firing the messenger”. Bill Beach, a
  former Heritage Foundation economist who was picked by Trump in 2018 to
  oversee labor statistics, denounced what he called the “totally groundless
  firing”. “Politicizing economic statistics is a self-defeating act,” said
  Michael Madowitz, the principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute’s
  Roosevelt Forward, who added that “credibility is far easier to lose than
  rebuild, and the credibility of America’s economic data is the foundation on
  which we’ve built the strongest economy in the world”. Senate Democrat Ron
  Wyden said “this is the act of somebody who is soft, weak and afraid to own up
  to the reality of the damage his chaos is inflicting on our economy”. The move
  came as markets around the world were roiled by Trump’s latest tariff
  announcement, which left more than 60 countries scrambling to secure trade
  deals. Here are the key US politics stories of the day: Trump orders firing of
  jobs report official after hiring slows Donald Trump ordered the firing of the
  federal government official in charge of labor statistics, hours after data
  revealed jobs growth stalled this summer, prompting accusations that he was
  “firing the messenger”. The US president claimed that Erika McEntarfer, the
  commissioner of labor statistics, had “faked” employment figures in the run-up
  to last year’s election in an effort to boost Kamala Harris’s chances of
  victory. Trump later claimed: “Today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to
  make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.” He produced no evidence for these
  allegations and insisted that the US economy was, in fact, “BOOMING” on his
  watch. Read the full story Trump moves nuclear submarines after ex-Russia
  leader’s menacing tweet Donald Trump has said that he deployed nuclear-capable
  submarines to the “appropriate regions” in response to a threatening tweet by
  Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that he would be ready
  to launch a nuclear strike as tensions rise over the war in Ukraine. In a post
  on Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the
  nuclear submarines because of “highly provocative statements” by Medvedev,
  noting he was now the deputy chair of Russia’s security council. Medvedev had
  earlier said that Trump’s threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum
  were “a threat and a step towards war”. Read the full story Dozens of
  countries scramble to cope with latest tariffs Donald Trump unleashed global
  chaos with sweeping new tariff rates, triggering a wave of market jitters and
  fears for jobs in some of the poorest countries, as rates were signed off
  ranging from 10% to 50%. There was a minor reprieve that opened the door to
  further negotiations, after the White House said the updated tariffs would
  take effect on 7 August, not on Friday, the deadline previously set by Trump.

  media posts on Friday, days after the Fed held rates steady for the fifth
  consecutive time. Read the full story Americans blame Trump for high cost of

  US federal “food stamps” program, according to experts. Low-income workers who
  rely on the aid are braced for dire consequences. California’s governor, Gavin
  Newsom, may call a special election in November to begin the process of
  redrawing the state’s congressional maps in response to Texas’s plans to
  change its own maps to help Republicans keep their majority in the House of
  Representatives. Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein’s associate who is
  currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes, has
  been transferred from a federal prison in Florida to a lower-security facility
