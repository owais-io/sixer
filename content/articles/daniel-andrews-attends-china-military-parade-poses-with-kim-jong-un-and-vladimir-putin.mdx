  Daniel Andrews has been criticised by the opposition for posing alongside
  North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin,
  at a military parade in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. The former Victorian Labor
  premier stood several rows behind the North Korean semi-recluse (who is facing
  complaints of alleged crimes against humanity) during the photo opportunity
  for leaders from the so-called “axis of upheaval”. In the photo, distributed
  by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Putin stands to Chinese president Xi
  Jinping’s right, with Kim to Xi’s left, and Xi’s wife, Peng Liyuan, in
  between. The leaders of Iran, Indonesia and a number of other countries are
  also in the group photo. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The group has
  assembled to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war. The
  former NSW Labor premier and federal foreign affairs minister Bob Carr is also
  in Beijing, but chose not to go to the “Soviet-style” military parade,
  according to Nine newspapers. He has other events later in the day, and is
  addressing two thinktanks. China is using the occasion to show off its
  military might, reportedly including drone displays, laser weapons, stealth
  fighters, advanced precision warfare equipment, helicopters and armoured
  vehicles. While China also displays its nuclear ballistic missiles, Ukraine is
  braced for more Russian missile and drone attacks, and North Korea is helping
  Russia in its offensive. The shadow home affairs spokesperson, Andrew Hastie,
  called it a “parade for dictators”, and criticised Carr’s and Andrews’
  presence in China. “It’s a celebration of the Chinese Communist party,” he
  said. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said Andrews needed to explain his
  presence at a military parade with Vladimir Putin and “what that actually
  tells the world”. But the current Victorian premier Jacinta Allan said it was
  good for the state that Andrews is “held in such high regard by the people of
  China”. “Victoria is an old friend of China and these connections are so
  valuable for our state,” she said. Allan said she was looking forward to
  building on the connection with a trade mission later this month, where she
  will launch Victoria’s new China strategy. The Victorian minister Vicki Ward
  said Andrews had made the choice “in his private capacity”, as a “private
  individual”, and that it was important for Australia to maintain “good,
  healthy relationships with those countries that are in our region”. But former
  Queensland Labor premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told Sky News the visit by
  Andrews and Carr was a “bridge too far”. No major western leaders attended the
  parade. Anthony Albanese was asked on Wednesday morning why Andrews was the
  most senior representative at the parade, and why Australia was only sending
  junior diplomats. “Well, we’re sending a diplomat. We’ll be there,” the prime
  minister said. In question time, Albanese was asked whether he would echo
  Palaszczuk’s condemnation and whether he or his office provided any assistance
  for the visit. He replied that 10 years ago the Liberal government sent one of
  its ministers for the 70th anniversary of the second world war, and that
  embassy officials were formally representing Australia this year, before
  speaking about celebrating the end of the war in the Pacific earlier this
  month in Sydney. Dr Jill Sheppard from Australian National University’s school
  of politics and international relations, said from a domestic politics
  perspective with “risk averse” parties, it was a good outcome for Labor to
  have Andrews as a “proxy representative”. “Both major parties find China
  really tough to talk about … in a lot of ways this is an ideal outcome for
  Labor to have someone visibly associated with them standing so close to
  sometimes controversial world leaders, but not have to be there themselves,”
  she said. “You can go to electorates with very high numbers of Chinese voters
  … and say look, we understand Chinese politics, we’re happy to engage with the
  country and its government, without being the one physically there, standing
  over Kim Jong-un’s shoulder. “The tough reality of dealing with foreign
  relations in a multicultural society is that you will have voters inside
  Australia with strong views about countries in both directions.” Jennifer
  Parker, adjunct fellow in naval studies at UNSW Canberra, said, “I suspect
  he’ll regret that photo in years to come.” The Australian reported that Scott
  Dewar, Australia’s ambassador to China would be out of the country. Earlier,
  Andrews was filmed shaking Xi’s hand. Albanese said Andrews was not meeting
  Putin or Kim. Guardian Australia has contacted Andrews for comment. Andrews
  left parliament in 2023. In 2024, he set up two companies, Glencairn Street
  Pty Ltd and Wedgetail Partners Pty Ltd, and was appointed chair of the board
  of the youth mental health centre Orygen. Carr wrote in the Nine newspapers
  this week that he was travelling to Beijing at his own expense for reasons
  including that, during the second world war, Chinese armies had “kept one
  million Japanese troops tied down”, which “made it impossible for the Japanese
  navy in 1942 to win its case for an invasion of Australia”. Additional
