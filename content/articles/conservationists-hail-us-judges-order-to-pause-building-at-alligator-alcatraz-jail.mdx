  A coalition of conservation groups has welcomed a federal judge’s ruling on
  Thursday that halts construction work on the immigration jail in the Florida
  Everglades known as Alligator Alcatraz. US district judge Kathleen Williams
  ordered workers to stop adding any new paving, infrastructure or ground
  filling at the remote tented detention camp that the Trump administration
  intends to use to eventually hold 3,000 immigrants awaiting deportation. Her
  verbal ruling, which she said would be reinforced by a written restraining
  order later on Thursday, will be in effect for two weeks while attorneys argue
  whether the construction of the camp broke environmental rules. US Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement (Ice) can continue to operate the camp and hold
  detainees there, Williams said, pending the resolution of the lawsuit’s claims
  that the project threatens fragile wetlands that are home to protected plants
  and animals, and will reverse billions of dollars’ worth of environmental
  restoration. “It’s a relief that the court has stepped in to protect the
  Everglades’ sensitive waters, starry skies and vulnerable creatures from
  further harm while we continue our case,” said Elise Bennett, attorney at the
  Center for Biological Diversity. “We’re ready to press forward and put a stop
  to this despicable plan for good.” The lawsuit, filed in Miami district court
  by an alliance including the Friends of the Everglades, Earthjustice and the
  Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, is challenging only the environmental
  impact of the jail, which opened last month after a high-visibility visit by
  Donald Trump. A separate lawsuit brought by civil rights groups says
  detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. They claim they are
  barred from meeting lawyers and are being held without charges, and that a
  federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings. A hearing in that case
  is scheduled for 18 August. In addition to facing legal proceedings, the
  opening of Alligator Alcatraz has been greeted by a wave of outrage by
  Democrats, some of whom toured the facility last month and decried “inhumane”
  conditions inside, including detainees held in cages, flooding from heavy
  rain, non-functioning toilets, broken air conditioning and swarms of
  mosquitoes. It was later also revealed that despite Trump’s assurances that
  the jail was reserved for “deranged psychopaths” and “some of the most vicious
  people on the planet”, hundreds of detainees had no criminal records or active
  charges against them. The lawsuit claims the detention facility violates the
  National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), which requires federal agencies to
  assess the environmental effects of major construction projects. Jesse
  Panuccio, attorney for the state of Florida, said during the hearing that
  although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the
  construction and operation of the facility was entirely under the state of
  Florida, meaning the Nepa review would not apply. His argument appeared not to
  sway Williams, who said the project was at a minimum a joint partnership
  between the state and federal government, and that anything built at the site
  would probably remain there permanently, regardless of how the case was
  ultimately decided. The plaintiffs presented witnesses on Wednesday and
  Thursday in support of the injunction, while attorneys for the state and
  federal government are scheduled to present their case next week. Talbert
  Cypress, chair of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, said he welcomed
  the decision to halt construction on and around the Big Cypress preserve, the
  group’s traditional tribal homelands. “The detention facility threatens land
  that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people,” he said.
  “While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our
  rights and protecting our homeland. The Miccosukee Tribe will continue to
  stand for our culture, our sovereignty and the Everglades.” The Associated
