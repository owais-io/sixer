  Dick Diver embodies a time that is both long gone and ever-present. They may
  have never been a household name but the Melbourne quartet, or what they
  represent, are a part of the national cultural fabric. Their lackadaisical
  affect belies the seriousness and sophistication of both their musicality and
  lyrics, which are unpretentiously and undeniably Australian. The band combine
  the slacker vibes of Pavement with the bookish lyricism (they take their name
  from a character in an F Scott Fitzgerald novel) and jangly “striped sunlight
  sound” of the Go-Betweens. Releasing three albums and an EP between 2009 and
  2015 through the celebrated Melbourne indie label Chapter Music, Dick Diver’s
  encapsulation of millennial malaise under capitalism made them the unwitting
  leaders of a genre jokingly nicknamed “dolewave”. The band, and much of the
  underground music press, bristled but the moniker nonetheless expressed
  something true: this was the music of the everyman, suburban poetics for the
  struggles and quiet joys of daily living. Sign up for the fun stuff with our
  rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday
  morning For me, Dick Diver was the sound of moving to Melbourne and starting
  my independent adult life. Living in sharehouses in Richmond and Carlton
  North, my housemates and I would cycle down to the Tote after working our
  entry-level jobs to see Rupert Edwards, Alistair McKay, Al Montfort and Steph
  Hughes play these songs that were somehow about us. Dick Diver soundtracked
  the changing tides of my life, spinning on a record player or blasting from a
  stage as I learned how to work, how to love, how to live. It’s been a while
  between drinks: Dick Diver’s last shows were in 2018 and, despite the
  memorable lyric “Europe’s fucked, probably”, half the band now lives there. In
  the intervening years they have busied themselves with other musical projects,
  including Sleeper and Snake, Terry and UV Race, and undergone new personal
  adventures, such as raising children. This surprise reunion was initially a
  one-off but demand ballooned it into a four-show affair, including two
  all-ages matinees. Despite it being 10 years since their last album, the
  cheekily named Melbourne, Florida, this is not the typical album-in-full
  nostalgia show. The sentimentality is there, of course – “It’s been such a
  treat to learn these old songs. It’s been a while since we’ve been together,”
  McKay tells the sold-out crowd on Friday night – but you’d be forgiven for
  forgetting any time had passed at all. It does take a little time to warm back
  up: the band feels a little subdued at their first show on Friday night, with
  their signature banter missing, and loud crowd chatter throughout the
  sprawling Amber – one of their best – dulling the meditative impact of the
  song’s languorous pace and surrealist imagery (“When I was young, I saw a
  horse in a stream / One day it looked at me and said, ‘Get a grip, dreamy,
  it’s the 21st century!’”) But the music sounds great and the band remains as
  tight as ever, with guest musicians on saxophone and trumpet elevating songs
  such as Lime Green Shirt and Private Number. Band members swap instruments and
  vocal duties, and it’s not hard to see how this ramshackle crew got together
  and made this magic. By Saturday, with two shows under the belt, the energy is
  immediately higher. The show kicks off with Alice, a highlight from the 2013
  album Calendar Days that sounds like REM’s Losing My Religion if it were set
  in the Northern Territory on a scorching summer’s day. The setlist is similar
  but for the addition of the “ancient” Flying Teatowel Blues, a strange, epic
  beast of a song that takes its cues from spaghetti westerns and shows the
  band’s versatility. The easy repartee reminds us of where we are and who they
  are. “Who can recite their CRN number?” Montfort says before the band plays
  New Start Again, the title track from their 2011 debut album. During the
  anthemic Head Back, the crowd roars “burn the flag” in unison – a lyric that
  clearly captures a mood in 2025. These songs are evergreen. Dick Diver’s value
  today is in more than just remembering the past: here is a band who manage to
  both embody the larrikinism of Australian culture and provide a howl of truth
  about what it means to live here, what it means to live at all. A Dick Diver
  show, rare and special as it is now, is a look both back and forward: things
  change, things stay the same.
