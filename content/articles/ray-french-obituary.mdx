  Although Ray French was a dual rugby international, winning four caps for
  England at rugby union and then, after signing professional terms to play
  rugby league, appearing four times for Great Britain, it was as the BBC’s
  rugby league commentator that he came to national prominence. French, who has
  died aged 85 after living with dementia, succeeded Eddie Waring as the BBC’s
  voice of the sport in 1981, spending 27 years in the role. Waring had
  established a public profile, beyond his verbally eccentric rugby
  commentaries, via frequent appearances in light entertainment shows and
  knockabout comedy routines. And, like Waring before him, French too became a
  somewhat divisive figure among a cohort of rugby league supporters who
  believed he entrenched a stereotypical perception of their sport. With his
  distinctive Lancashire enunciation, catchphrases and characteristic lexicon,
  his critics accused the national broadcaster of choosing a figurehead designed
  to “keep the sport in its place”: an idiosyncratic pastime of northern
  England. However, to focus solely on his presentational style would be to mask
  the depth of knowledge French had for both codes of rugby, especially league.
  His command of the history of the two codes and his personal experiences of
  the prejudices constantly marring their relationship were leitmotifs running
  through his spoken and written work, imbuing his delivery with authenticity.
  He also called some of the most celebrated matches during his BBC tenure,
  including the 1985 Challenge Cup final between Wigan and Hull, oft-regarded as
  the greatest final of all, and 12-man Great Britain’s against-the-odds victory
  over Australia at Wembley in 1994 when fellow cross-coder Jonathan Davies
  scored one of the finest tries seen at the stadium. “Davies, he’s got some
  space. He’s going for the corner, he’s got his head back. And the Welshman is
  in for a magnificent try” are words longstanding supporters can recite
  verbatim. Despite such highlights, French always said his most professional
  achievement at the BBC was during the second half of a commentary when, stuck
  high on a gantry, he was so desperate to relieve himself that, while still
  speaking, he was forced to use a bucket held by his match summariser.
  Meanwhile, his books – which include My Kind of Rugby: Union and League (1979)
  and Ray French … and Rugby (2010) – explore the complex socioeconomic and
  political relationships between the two rugby codes. And despite the
  longstanding animosity between them, often based on class and misplaced
  prejudice, he did much to break down barriers he considered absurd. Indeed,
  French was an advocate of a single rugby code, noting that “the strength of
  rugby union is along the M4 corridor from London into Wales, while the
  strength of rugby league is along the M62 corridor in northern England. If
  rugby stopped dividing its resources, we’d have a game to challenge football.”
  French was born in St Helens. His father, Richard, worked in the local glass
  industry and his mother, Ellen, was a homemaker. Although he was raised in a
  rugby league-supporting family, in 1955 a scholarship took him from Rivington
  Road school to Cowley grammar in nearby Windle where he first encountered
  rugby union. There his prowess as a robust back-row forward attracted the
  interest of the St Helens rugby union club. He quickly won Lancashire county
  honours and the attention of the England selectors. He won four international
  caps, playing second-row in England’s Five Nations matches in 1961. Despite
  England’s disappointing campaign, French prospered amid a mediocre pack and
  looked set for further call-ups. However, St Helens, his hometown professional
  rugby league club, had been monitoring his progress and in late 1961 offered
  him a £5,000 contract which initially he turned down. But the opportunity to
  play his favoured code eventually proved irresistible. He became part of the
  club’s formidable forward pack, playing an integral role in Saints’
  double-winning season of 1965-66 as they won the Championship and Challenge
  Cup. However, although he had become club captain, St Helens sold French to
  their local rivals Widnes in 1967. He was not especially pleased, describing
  it as “feeling like a piece of meat on a supermarket shelf” but it would be at
  Widnes where he earned his rugby league international honours, travelling to
  Australia and New Zealand with Great Britain’s 1968 World Cup squad.
  Unfortunately, the team’s lacklustre performances meant many squad members,
  including French, would not be selected again. Meanwhile, while still playing
  professionally at St Helens, French studied for a degree in English, Latin and
  Russian at Leeds University. He graduated in 1962 and applied for teacher
  training at Loughborough University, only to be turned down because he was a
  rugby league professional. He eventually qualified back at Leeds and taught
  English at his alma mater Cowley, where he stayed until retirement. It was
  during his time at Cowley that French began commentating on rugby league for
  local radio, eventually progressing to the BBC. He was appointed MBE in 2011
  for services to rugby league. The man-of-the-match award in the 1895 Cup Final
  for lower-division teams is named after him, reflecting his love of, and
  involvement in, grassroots rugby. His wife, Helen (nee Bromilow), whom he
  married in 1963, survives him, as do his son, Gary, and daughter, Susan. •
