  Microphones and Betty Boothroyd-style projection are both useful tools for

  The increasing use of microphones on stage (‘We can hear their saliva’: why
  are so many actors suddenly using microphones?, 4 August) has prompted more
  astute producers and theatres to transform their audiences’ engagement. When a
  sound operator sends the signal from a mic directly through the loop system,
  anyone using hearing aids or the theatre’s own headphones gets a degree of
  clarity that is unequalled. Along with captioning, this is a lifeline for
  millions who attend theatre. I know it goes against the grain for old stagers
  who hold that unenhanced “shouting at night” is the purest form of theatre,
  but those with some degree of hearing loss – one in three of the UK population
  – will tell you a different story. Richard Lee Leigh-on-Sea, Essex • Emma John
  mentions a veteran actor who trained his voice to fill large spaces and
  refuses to use a microphone. This reminded me of an Open University awards
  ceremony many years ago. The microphone went down and my colleague announcing
  the graduands was told by Betty Boothroyd, in her best Speaker’s voice, to
  project! A lovely moment. Chris Walters Buxton, Derbyshire • Have an opinion
