  The mechanisms of a football team are delicate. You win the league then add
  nearly £300m of talent and it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll win it again,
  doesn’t necessarily make you better, even if you’re not doing something as
  obviously likely to cause imbalance as adding Kylian Mbappé to a Real Madrid
  team already stacked with left-sided attackers. Liverpool go into Sunday’s
  home game against Arsenal having won two out of two in the Premier League and
  scored a healthy seven goals. But those aren’t the statistics that tell the
  whole story. If you include the Community Shield, Liverpool have conceded two
  goals in each of their three games so far. The defensive problems are obvious
  and the return of Ryan Gravenberch at Newcastle on Monday did not magically
  solve them. Just as telling, perhaps, is that Liverpool, despite letting in
  those six goals, are yet to go behind this season. That is remarkable for a
  team who last season made the uneventful 2-0 win a trademark. In fact, the
  largest single factor in their title success was their capacity to control a
  game having taken the lead, winning without drama, but also allowing players
  to get through games without expending absolutely all their energy, to remain
  fresh for longer, a factor – surely – in Liverpool’s positive injury record
  last season. But Liverpool couldn’t hold Crystal Palace at arm’s length, and
  then against Bournemouth and Newcastle let the opposition back into the game
  having gone 2-0 up early in the second half, in both cases needing late
  strikes to regain the initiative. In both cases individual errors played their
  part, but the Newcastle game was striking for the way Liverpool simply
  couldn’t get the game under control – even against 10 men. Perhaps it was
  simply the case that in an atmosphere so fevered, composure was impossible;
  with nothing to lose, Newcastle hurled themselves into a frenzied series of
  attacks that might have brought a draw but instead led to that oddest of
  things, a Pyrrhic defeat, a game from which they took great credit but no
  points, and also lost three players to injury and one to suspension. The
  individual errors are a concern, but in a sense are less of a worry than
  structural problems in that they should be easier to put right. Milos Kerkez
  has had a difficult start to life at Liverpool. Ismaïla Sarr kept dragging him
  out of position in the Community Shield. He never got to grips with Antoine
  Semenyo in the Bournemouth game. And other than taking an inordinate amount of
  time over throw-ins, his main contribution to the game at Newcastle was to
  stoop out of the way as Bruno Guimarães outjumped him to head in a left-wing
  cross. Although Slot has not lost his knack of facing opponents at just the
  right time – Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard will all miss
  Sunday’s game through injury – Noni Madueke’s performances against Kerkez for
  Chelsea last season suggest he may relish coming in on the Arsenal right.
  Kerkez may be the player most obviously struggling, but he’s not the only one.
  Ibrahima Konaté has looked shaky in all three games so far, although the fact
  he was outjumped by Dan Burn to flick on for William Osula to equalise on
  Monday was less to do with him than with a bafflingly high defensive line that
  allowed the free-kick to be clipped into vast meadows of attacking
  possibility. With Konaté backtracking and Burn moving on to the ball, there
  was only likely to be one winner. Slot played down the issue, saying it had
  happened at only one free-kick, but the sense remains of a back four ill at
  ease with itself. To an extent that’s natural with changes in both full-back
  positions, and perhaps especially given the injury to Jeremie Frimpong that
  meant Dominik Szoboszlai having to fill in at right-back until Conor Bradley’s
  arrival from the bench. But football teams are not made up of discrete units;
  at least part of the Liverpool defence’s discomfort has been changes in
  midfield. Perhaps it will settle down. Perhaps once Gravenberch has got a run
  of games together, playing alongside Alexis Mac Allister again at the back of
  midfield, they will adjust to functioning as a deep-lying two in a 4-2-3-1
  rather than as two-thirds of a midfield three. Certainly they did not leave
  Virgil van Dijk and Konaté as Wataru Endo and Curtis Jones did for
  Bournemouth’s equaliser. But they are not comfortable yet. Slot impressed in
  his first season in the way he so often made a positive difference with
  tactical tweaks or changes in personnel and in that regard it’s not
  insignificant that substitutes – Federico Chiesa against Bournemouth and Rio
  Ngumoha against Newcastle – scored the goals that restored Liverpool’s leads.
  But equally it felt telling that he didn’t make a change at St James’ Park
  until the 80th minute, and that so much of their play, from the first whistle,
  seemed intended to preserve energy. This was not the ferocious pressing of the
  Jürgen Klopp years, but it wasn’t even like last season, when Liverpool were
  very effective at applying periods of intense pressure. It may be that
  represents Slot’s unease with the depth of his squad – and it seems he would
  like at least two more signings before the window closes on Monday. Or more to
  do with an anxiety about how open the midfield appears in its new shape.
  Either way, it’s clear that Liverpool are vulnerable in a way they weren’t
  last season. There was derision in certain quarters when Jamie Carragher
  suggested last season, as Liverpool cruised to the title, that they needed
  half a dozen new signings, but the past few weeks have highlighted just what
  an odd side they were, simultaneously highly effective and in need of
  refurbishment, largely Klopp with a dash of Slot. The process of rejuvenation
  and conversion into a more Slot-oriented squad has now begun but inevitably,
  when so many new elements are introduced into a system which itself needs to
  be tweaked to accommodate them, there is a process of bedding in. And then, of
  course, there is the shock of the death of Diogo Jota in July, the impact of
  which is unpredictable and continuing. Arsenal’s injuries mean Liverpool may
  feel they are getting them at the right time, but Liverpool’s uncertainty
  could just as easily lead Arsenal to the same conclusion.
