  Senior Democratic senators have called on the US secretary of state, Marco
  Rubio, and the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, to reveal details
  behind the financing and oversight of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)
  amid concerns over rising death tolls near aid sites, the group’s apparent
  coordination with the Israeli army and its reported use of private military
  contractors linked to intelligence operations. The letter, co-signed by
  senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen and Peter Welch, accuses the state
  department of an “inability to answer basic questions about GHF in a timely
  manner” and said that the department’s “overriding of internal protocol and
  staff warnings is particularly concerning given it is unlikely to be able to
  conduct basic oversight of the funds it provided to GHF”. The letter, which
  was addressed to Rubio, Huckabee and Russell Vought, the powerful director of
  the office of management and budget and current administrator for the US
  Agency for International Development, was delivered to the state department
  over the weekend and shared exclusively with the Guardian. “The state
  department should immediately cease funding GHF and transfer or restore
  funding to experienced aid organizations given the strong and growing evidence
  that GHF is failing to accomplish its humanitarian mission,” they wrote. Trump
  has said that the US disbursed $60m in food aid to Gaza, while the state
  department has only publicly acknowledged approval for a $30m grant for the
  GHF in June. The state department has not published details of its grant to
  the GHF, an omission that the senators said violates US law. Nearly 1,000
  Palestinians have died near GHF sites since its operations began in May, the
  UN reported in mid-August. The new concerns come as the agency was mentioned
  in a draft plan for a “Gaza riviera” that critics have said would provide
  cover for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territory’s
  population and was reportedly developed by those close to the GHF. The 38-page
  prospectus, which has not been formally adopted as US policy, nonetheless
  would be one way to fulfill Donald Trump’s calls for a “takeover” of the Gaza
  Strip. The plan, which was first revealed by the Washington Post, also relied
  on consultants from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG has said that work was
  not approved and that it had fired two senior partners who led the financial
  modeling for the plan). In their letter, the Democratic senators also attacked
  the GHF for its connections to the Israeli government and the use of private
  military contractors that have reportedly conducted intelligence operations.
  “The provision of humanitarian aid to starving populations should not be a
  pretext for military intelligence operations,” they wrote. In the letter, the
  senators also demanded copies of award documents, internal reviews, export
  licenses for military services and other vetting that is legally required for
  GHF operations but have not yet been made public. The Guardian has approached
  the state department and the GHF for comment.
