  When I was about 16, I went to Bradgate Park in Leicestershire with a couple
  of friends. We were there as sunset approached and the landscape became
  illuminated by beautiful golden-hour light. There were deer and stags all
  around and I asked one of my friends if I could borrow his camera. It must
  have been quite annoying for him because I remember wandering off, trying to
  capture this feeling of mystery and magic. That was the moment I first really
  felt a sense of excitement for photography and image-making. Before then, I’d
  visited many museums and art galleries with my mum and was inspired by some of
  the art we saw. I was particularly drawn to portraits by Vermeer and
  Rembrandt. I’ve never been good at drawing or painting, but having a camera
  gave me a tool to express that creative energy. While studying photography at
  university, I was introduced to mind-blowing work, like Alec Soth’s book
  Sleeping by the Mississippi. I was struck by his portrait of a man holding a
  pair of model aeroplanes. There’s a simplicity to the image, but it’s also
  powerful and visually striking. I felt drawn to narrative-based documentary
  portraiture. For my final-year project, I spent time in monastic communities
  around Britain, making portraits of nuns, monks and other people I encountered
  within them. That branched out into one of the three long-term projects I’m
  currently working on, Rivers of Living Water, a wider-ranging series about the
  Christian faith in Britain, and the diverse nature of its cultures,
  denominations and perspectives. Fabian, who you see in this photograph, is
  someone I found on Instagram. I was inspired by his story of growing up in
  inner-city east London, where it was hard for him to pursue his love of
  horses. He persevered and now competes in eventing competitions, determined to
  help increase inclusivity in the equestrian community. He’s set himself the
  goal of becoming a five-time Olympic gold medallist. This was taken in
  Hertfordshire, near the stables Fabian was using, on a January morning last
  year. Initially, I went to photograph him a few months before and while we had
  got some good images the light wasn’t great and we agreed to try again later.
  On this occasion, just before sunrise, we got this soft pink sky and the field
  was still covered with beautiful morning frost. Fabian looks incredible in
  that outfit and the horse, Morgan, also looks amazing. My preferred approach
  is to take things slowly and spend time with my subject, create a calm energy
  and capture a sense of who they are. I rarely use film now, but my technique
  is informed by having used it – I don’t take lots of photographs, but instead
  wait until there’s a moment of stillness and peace. I love natural light: a
  lot of my work makes use of evening or morning light or mist. There’s another
  shot of Fabian taken about an hour after this one that I’m equally happy with.
  By then, the frost had mostly gone but the rising winter sun created strong
  shadows and a warmer tone. In both cases, I didn’t want the photographs to
  appear staged, I wanted something simple and genuine. I chose to photograph
  Fabian because I found his story interesting and inspiring. These portraits
  are about him and his equestrian journey. They are also included in the Rivers
  of Living Water series. The project encompasses spirituality, peace and
  serenity, but not every image is obviously religious. There are many that show
  people going about their everyday lives. My approach is always to try to be
  respectful and to honour the people I photograph. It’s a way of exploring my
  own personal faith, too. John Boaz’s CV Born: Northamptonshire, England.
  Trained: Visual communication degree at Birmingham City University.
  Influences: “Paintings are a major inspiration for my work and music, too,
  helps me develop ideas. I’d name Alec Soth, Alys Tomlinson and Bryan Schutmaat
  as inspirational.” High point: “Being one of the winners of Portrait of
  Britain Volume 7 and having one of my portraits as the front cover of the
  book. Also having my work selected to be part of this year’s Royal
  Photographic Society International Photography exhibition. Low point: “I
  sometimes have creative low moments when I feel drained and not inspired or
  motivated but this does not last long, thankfully. This year a low point was
  not being chosen as a finalist in the Belfast Photo festival – however Rivers
  of Living Water was shortlisted so I am grateful for that.” Top tip: “Stay
  true to who you are and make work you feel led to make. Be inspired by others
  but do not compare your work in a negative way to them. Be kind and supportive
  to other artists/photographers’ work and their journey.” • John Boaz’s work is
  part of the RPS International Photography exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery,
  London, 5 August to 18 September.
