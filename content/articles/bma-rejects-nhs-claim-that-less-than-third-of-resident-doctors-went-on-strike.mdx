  The doctors’ union has rejected NHS figures showing that less than a third of
  resident doctors joined strike action in England last week and 93% of planned
  operations and procedures went ahead. NHS England said it maintained care for
  an estimated 10,000 more patients during the latest doctors’ strike compared
  with last year’s, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, seized on the
  figures and said it was time to “move past the cycle of disruption”. But the
  British Medical Association (BMA) rejected the figures, saying complex work
  schedules and doctors taking leave made it “almost impossible to know” how
  many had joined the action. The number that took part in the five-day strike
  was down by 7.5% on the previous round of industrial action, according to an
  early analysis of management information. NHS England said it would publish
  the fuller data in due course. Resident doctors, previously known as junior
  doctors, went on strike demanding a 29% pay rise and have been embroiled in an
  increasingly acrimonious war of words with the government, which has refused
  to negotiate on pay. Streeting said this weekend: “A majority of resident
  doctors didn’t vote for strike action and data shows that less than a third of
  residents took part. I want to thank those resident doctors who went to work,
  for their commitment to their patients and to our shared mission to rebuild
  the NHS. “I want to end this unnecessary dispute and I will be urging the BMA
  to work with the government in good faith in our shared endeavour to improve
  the working lives of resident doctors, rather than pursuing more reckless
  strike action.” But the BMA said: “NHS England’s claim that the majority of
  England’s 77,000 resident doctors chose to ‘join the NHS-wide effort to keep
  the services open’ requires a huge stretch of the imagination, given it is
  almost impossible to know the exact number of residents working on any given
  day because of complex work patterns, on-call schedules and the strike spread
  across a weekend. “Added to that, in July many doctors are using up their
  remaining annual leave before their new posts start and would therefore not
  show up as striking. We look forward to seeing hard and fast data on NHS
  England’s claim. “The strike could have been averted, as could any future
  ones, if Mr Streeting had come, and will come, to the table with a credible
  offer that resident doctors in England can accept.” Resident doctors make up
  about half of all doctors in the NHS and have up to eight years’ experience
  working in hospitals or three in general practice. Some NHS trusts experienced
  minimal disruption from the latest strike. The West Hertfordshire teaching
  hospitals trust carried out 98% of its planned activity while the University
  College London hospitals trust and Northumbria healthcare foundation trust
  both carried out 95%. James Mackey, the NHS chief executive, said that care
  was still disrupted for thousands of people as a result of the strike and that
  any repeat would be “unacceptable”. He urged the resident doctors committee to
  “get back to the negotiating table”. NHS Providers, which represents hospital
  trusts, said the stoppage took a toll and that trusts were concerned about
  potential wider industrial action in the health service. Saffron Cordery, the
  NHS Providers deputy chief executive, said: “This dispute can’t drag on. The
  union says resident doctors want this to be their last strike. With talks due
  to resume, let’s hope so. Bringing disruptive strikes – where the only people
  being punished are patients – to an end must be a priority. “We’re concerned,
  as trusts worked hard to minimise disruption and to keep patients safe during
  the resident doctors’ strike, by the threat of wider industrial action in the
  NHS.”
