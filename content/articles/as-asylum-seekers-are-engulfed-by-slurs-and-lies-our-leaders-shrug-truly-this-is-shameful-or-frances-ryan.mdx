  As anti-migrant demonstrations continued in Canary Wharf in London at the
  weekend, one group stood out: women dressed in Barbie pink. Holding cardboard
  signs drawn in bright felt-tip pen (“save our kids”), the “pink protest”
  marched under the banner of protecting women and girls. The crowd may have
  looked a novel sight, but it points to a rationale that is increasingly
  gaining ground this summer: asylum seekers are a danger to British women and
  girls. While the hundreds of protesters across the country – both peaceful and
  violent – share different motivations, there is a consistent sense that
  “foreigners” are a threat at best economically and culturally, and at worst
  physically and sexually. The ongoing unrest outside the Bell hotel in Epping,
  Essex was first sparked after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was charged with the
  alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl, an accusation he has formally
  denied. Look at any of the towns and cities that have since seen protests –
  from Newcastle to Ballymena – and the far right, already having hijacked anger
  over the Rotherham grooming gangs scandal, are organising online under slogans
  such as “For our children, for our future”. Within days of the first Canary
  Wharf march, a group in Hampshire announced their own “pink protest” for – as
  they tweeted – “the safety of women and children in the community”. Such ideas
  are not consigned to the fringes of the far right or a few local groups: they
  are being employed – and encouraged – by mainstream news outlets and
  politicians. As the new wave of protests kicked off, the Mail on Sunday ran an
  investigation into the number of asylum seekers who “have repaid the
  generosity of British taxpayers by committing serious offences”, including
  rape and sexual assault. Such exposés have quickly widened from targeting men
  on “small boats” to migrants generally, with the two groups often blurred. The
  Times recently ran a front page warning one in eight prisoners are now born
  overseas, with the number convicted of sexual and violent crimes increasing.
  That the data shows that one in six residents of England and Wales are born
  outside the UK – and therefore migrants are actually underrepresented in
  prisons, despite being more likely to be held on remand – was, funnily enough,
  not mentioned. Meanwhile, the Conservatives and Reform UK are increasingly
  confident in linking immigration to crime. On Sunday, shadow justice secretary
  Robert Jenrick said asylum seekers with “medieval attitudes” coming to Britain
  mean he is afraid for the safety of his three young daughters. Last month,
  Nigel Farage explicitly claimed increased migration was responsible for a rise
  in the number of rapes and sexual assaults in the UK, pointing to arrivals
  from – as he put it – “countries in which women aren’t even second-class
  citizens”. It seems those so-called legitimate concerns now include the fear
  that asylum seekers are coming over here to rape our women and girls. It would
  be easy for the government to dispel such myths by making the facts around
  sexual violence clear. But when I asked the Home Office if it collects data on
  criminal offences by asylum seekers, it declined to provide any formal
  comment. When I asked the Home Office if it would like to put on record that –
  as was confirmed to me by several refugee and women’s charities – there are no
  official figures that show asylum seekers are more likely to commit sexual
  offences than British nationals, it did not respond. It was, however, keen to
  stress it has just released data about foreign nationals (a term that includes
  many others who are not asylum seekers) in prisons. This ambiguity – and
  outright radio silence – is unhelpful to say the least, but it is also a
  choice. Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, outlined the
  facts in black and white. “There is no clear or credible evidence that people
  seeking asylum commit more crimes, and any data suggesting that must be viewed
  in the context of systemic bias, including in policing.” Ministers could say
  the same, but they do not. The net effect is a vacuum that bad actors are left
  to fill with bigotry and misinformation, conflating asylum, migration and
  criminality to falsely portray asylum seekers – many of whom will be victims
  of abuse and torture themselves – as a potential danger to the British people.
  Just look to Warwickshire, where the leader of the Reform-led county council
  is accusing police of a “cover up” over the immigration status of two men
  charged with the alleged rape of a local child (police vehemently deny that).
  The vacuum always gets filled: on Saturday, the far right marched outside
  council offices in Nuneaton, with crowds shouting officers were “protecting
  paedophiles”. What we are seeing is in many ways an extension of the
  centuries-old racial prejudice that ethnic minorities are a sexual threat to
  white females (and the white males who claim possession of them). But it is
  also part of a wider negative depiction of asylum seekers – a narrative that
  says they are dishonest, greedy and criminal. Think of the spurious stories
  that child refugees are, in fact, devious adults pretending to be children. Is
  it any wonder a new YouGov poll shows nearly half of Britons wrongly believe
  that illegal migrants now outnumber those here legally? The same forces that
  wish to disproportionately associate asylum seekers or migrants with sexual
  assaults have quite successfully sold the lie that they have already committed
  a crime by being in the country. Just as we saw with the unrest after the
  Southport murders last summer, all of this not only inflames racial tensions –
  it distracts from the very real epidemic of gender-based violence. Few of the
  politicians or pundits concerned about so-called small boat “perverts” ever
  mention the crisis of, say, rape trial backlogs or funding cuts for domestic
  violence refuges. Some protesters will feel genuine worry for the safety of
  local women. For others, tackling male violence is only desirable if those
  males are migrants or asylum seekers. Indeed, many involved in the Southport
  disturbances were perpetrators themselves: two in five people arrested for
  last year’s riots had previously been reported for domestic violence. There is
  no clear way out of this when the two main parties are busy in a race to the
  bottom: as of this week, Labour is pondering letting police release the
  ethnicity or immigration status of criminal suspects, while the Conservatives
  have suggested authorities should “swab and track” asylum seekers arriving on
  small boats – effectively storing their DNA on the assumption they may commit
  crimes in the future. It feels a dark kind of summer, in which prejudice is
  dressed in fuchsia and the political class shrug their shoulders while the
  angry mob grows. We are often told that newcomers to these shores refuse to
  adopt “British values”, but perhaps those stoking the public’s worst instincts
  can remember one themselves: in this country, people are innocent until proven
  guilty. That includes asylum seekers too. Frances Ryan is a Guardian
