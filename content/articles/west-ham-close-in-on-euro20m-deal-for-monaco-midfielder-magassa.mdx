  West Ham are in advanced talks over a deal to sign the Monaco midfielder
  Soungoutou Magassa for €17m (£14.7m) plus €3m in add-ons. Graham Potter, who
  is under growing pressure after opening the campaign with heavy defeats by
  Sunderland and Chelsea, is desperate for midfield reinforcements and has been
  pushing for the 21-year-old to join. West Ham have had an agreement on a fee
  with Monaco since the weekend but have been working on personal terms. Potter
  and his recruitment chief, Kyle Macaulay, have spoken to Magassa about where
  he would fit in. Talks ramped up late on Monday night and continued on Tuesday
  morning. Nottingham Forest have also shown interest in the France Under-21
  international. West Ham’s scouts have done extensive work on Magassa, who made
  31 appearances for Monaco last season, and regard him as an ideal fit. Their
  ponderous midfield is woefully short of speed and energy. Potter is also
  looking to add creativity and does not intend to stop with Magassa. West Ham
  are looking for a No 8 but have encountered frustration in their pursuit of
  Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes. Southampton have an excellent chance of
  keeping Fernandes after raising funds through the sale of Tyler Dibling to
  Everton. West Ham may be forced to move to other targets, including
  Feyernoord’s Quinten Timber. They are monitoring Ajax’s Kenneth Taylor,
  Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney, Rennes’ Djaoui Cissé, Torino’s Ivan Ilic and
  Werder Bremen’s Romano Schmid. Potter does not have a huge budget and the move
  for Magassa depended on Edson Álvarez or Guido Rodríguez leaving. West Ham
  could not find a buyer for Álvarez but got the Mexico midfielder’s wages off
  the books after loaning him to Fenerbahce. Rodríguez has interest from Spain
  and is surplus to requirements. West Ham have turned down a bid from Everton
  for Tomas Soucek but the Czech Republic midfielder could still be allowed to
  leave. Potter faces a battle to lift the mood in the dressing room. Lucas
  Paquetá has interest from several clubs but West Ham are unlikely to sell the
  Brazil midfielder on the cheap.
