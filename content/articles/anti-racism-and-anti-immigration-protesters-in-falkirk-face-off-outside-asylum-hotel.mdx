  Anti-racism campaigners held a counter-demonstration against people protesting
  against “uncontrolled illegal immigration” outside a hotel used to house
  asylum seekers in Scotland. Stand Up to Racism Scotland, Falkirk Trades Union
  Council and local people said they organised the gathering in Falkirk on
  Saturday to show that refugees are welcome in the town. Organisers described
  it as a “safely stewarded community event with music, speeches from the local
  community, the trade union movement, local campaigns, faith groups and
  others”. Demonstrators held placards with messages such as “stop the far
  right”, “refugees welcome” and “migrants make our NHS”. Police said Kemper
  Avenue in Falkirk was closed due to protest activity which began at about
  11am. The road reopened on Saturday night, with Police Scotland confirming a
  26-year-old man was arrested in connection with a breach of the cordon line.
  The group Save Our Future &amp; Our Kids Futures had announced plans to hold a
  protest outside the hotel known as the Cladhan. In a social media post the
  group said it was “standing against uncontrolled illegal immigration, with
  people being placed in our communities without transparency, accountability,
  or consultation”. It added: “This is not about hate, racism, or division. This
  is about safety, justice, and standing up for the people of Falkirk who
  deserve better.” Protesters, some waving union flags, chanted “send them home”
  while anti-racism demonstrators responded with chants of “refugees are welcome
  here” and “this is what community looks like”. Similar protests have been held
  in recent months in Epping, Essex, near the Bell hotel which houses asylum
  seekers. In July, some of the demonstrations descended into violent disorder
  with 28 people arrested after police officers were injured. The protests in
  Essex started after an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was accused of
  sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. He is in custody awaiting further
  court hearings. Earlier this August, several demonstrators were detained after
  rival groups faced off over a hotel accommodating asylum seekers in north
  London. The counter-protest outside the Thistle City Barbican hotel in
  Islington was organised by local branches of Stand Up to Racism and was
  supported by the former Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn.
