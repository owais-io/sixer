  Rumours have long swirled about what lies beneath the great 1960s fortress of
  the former US embassy on Grosvenor Square. There have been lurid fables of
  cold war bunkers, secret service shooting ranges, CIA interrogation chambers
  and even escape tunnels to Hyde Park. But none of these fictional fantasies
  quite compare to the underground lair that has now been excavated below the
  imposing block, in its new incarnation as one of the fanciest hotels in
  London. Owned by the royal family of Qatar, and operated by an offshore
  company registered in the British Virgin Islands, belonging to one of Hong
  Kong’s wealthiest dynasties, this former outpost of US imperialism has become
  a gilded temple to the new global order. Reborn as the Chancery Rosewood, it
  is a beacon of luxury designed to attract the cream of the world’s ultra-high
  net worth individuals, so it is only fitting that it should boast the
  mega-basement to end all mega-basements. Descending a grand ceremonial
  staircase, you find yourself in a colossal marble-lined antechamber, a
  four-storey volume dripping with chandeliers and veneers, reflected in a
  mirror-polished black ceiling. It feels like the entrance to Kim Il Sung’s
  mausoleum, but it is the prelude to a gigantic ballroom (serviced by its own
  car elevator) which sits atop a subterranean spa complex, with swimming pool,
  saunas and therapy rooms, dug 20 metres below the ground. Long off-limits to
  the public, access to the building is now limited only by the size of your
  chequebook. The entry-level “junior suites” start at £1,400 per night. For the
  architects, however, the ambition was to open up a building that had long been
  sealed off. “We really wanted to make it feel as public as possible,” says
  Julia Loughnane, director at David Chipperfield Architects, the firm
  responsible for this somewhat sisyphean task. “It was about stripping away all
  the barriers and restoring a sense of openness.” When the Finnish-American
  architect Eero Saarninen designed the building in the 1950s, as the first
  purpose-built embassy in London, it was intended as an image of open,
  easy-going America. It featured a public library next to the visa office on
  its raised ground floor, flooded with a sense of airy transparency and framed
  by a striking “diagrid” ceiling of intersecting concrete beams. But the blocky
  form and chequerboard facade, with windows surrounded by big picture frames of
  Portland stone, wasn’t to everyone’s taste. Critic Reyner Banham called it
  “monumental in bulk, frilly in detail,” while others compared it to a
  cigarette factory. Public ire against the hulk only increased in the following
  years, when it became the focus of Vietnam war protests and other
  demonstrations against American might, which in turn prompted the construction
  of ever more defensive barriers and security pavilions. By the 2000s, the
  perceived terror threat was so great, and Mayfair neighbours so irate, that
  the mission fled across the river to Nine Elms, retreating inside a
  plastic-clad castle on a hill, surrounded by a moat. In many ways, Saarinen’s
  building is therefore more open and accessible than it has ever been in living
  memory. Not that much of the structure is actually still there. In order to
  accommodate the services required by the hotel, practically everything behind
  the facade has been demolished and rebuilt. The original U-shaped block has
  been given a fourth side in order to fit 144 suites, with an atrium in the
  middle. It has grown vertically too, not that you might realise at first.
  “Typically,” says David Chipperfield, “the conservation lobby wants to see a
  very clear distinction between what was there and what has been added. But
  we’ve developed a different strategy on a number of projects, from the Neues
  Museum [in Berlin] onwards, where the difference isn’t so obvious.” In the
  case of Grosvenor Square, his team has “stretched” Saarinen’s facade, adding a
  much taller sixth storey, in the same manner as the original, with an
  additional two storeys set back as a golden rooftop pavilion, housing a bar
  and two humungous penthouse suites. The move is deft and precisely executed,
  and justified on heritage grounds thanks to one of Saarinen’s own sketches. He
  came up with his competition-winning design while on his three-week honeymoon
  in London, where he covered the walls and mirrors of his hotel room with
  sketches – one of which, to the Qataris’ joy, depicted a much bigger version
  of the building. “It was a very helpful discovery,” says Chipperfield. “I
  suspect Saarinen wanted a taller building, but there wasn’t the need for it,
  once he had laid out the functions across the full width of the square.” He’s
  right: the inflated version actually feels better suited to its context than
  the original. The removal of the defensive sloping stone bank, or glacis, that
  used to ring the building is a welcome change too, making the ground floor
  open to the pavement for the first time. The Qataris have also been lucky in
  that the Finn had a penchant for bling. Visit the building today and you will
  find the ends of the beams, which project through the facade, clad in
  gold-anodised aluminium, along with further gilded adornments around the
  windows, and a frilly gold crown along the roof. They look like the tacky
  trappings of a luxury hotel (or something a modernist Trump might add to his
  Oval Office), but these are in fact original. They were intended, Saarinen
  said, to “add sparkle to the facade”. (Not so the new gilded entrance
  canopies, which bear the gaudy hand of the Rosewood takeover.) Saarinen’s gold
  cruciform columns extend into the lobby too, although that’s pretty much all
  that’s left of his interior. Chipperfield’s team have done their best to
  restore and extended the diagrid ceiling, as well as preserve the light
  fittings and various bits of balustrade, but any sense of the original scheme
  has been entirely drowned out by Rosewood’s interior designers, who have
  cranked up the sparkle setting to the max. Masterminded by French designer
  Joseph Dirand, it is a fever dream of opulence, every surface writhing with
  exotic stones, woods and fabrics, a plush palette that looks plucked from an
  oligarch’s luxury yacht. There have been some attempts to riff off the
  original building. The new atrium, for example, is lined with giant square
  O-rings like the facade, but covered in dark wood. “We inspected 1.4m square
  metres of walnut,” a Rosewood spokesperson tells me, “in order to use 600 sq
  m, because we wanted it without the knots.” Such lengths of profligate
  perfectionism extend to every detail. The bathrooms in the junior suites are
  entirely smothered in green Indian marble (“We used up the world’s last
  remaining marble of that type,” they tell me proudly), which they say took one
  mason in Carrara, Italy, six years to cut. Another marble apparently comes
  from the same quarry as the Pantheon. “We have 100 types of stone from all
  across the world,” the rep continues, “and we are slated to be the first
  five-star hotel to be rated Breeam Outstanding for sustainability”. That will
  be some feat, if the embodied carbon footprint of crushing an existing
  concrete building and shipping countless tonnes of stone across the globe are
  factored in to the assessment. The suites swell in size as we rise through the
  hotel, progressively expanding to include offices, private kitchens, steam
  rooms and two-person bathtubs. The rooms are also configured with little
  lobbies, so they can be rented together for extended family and staff. One
  future guest recently visited with his entourage, with the intention of
  “taking a couple of floors,” with enough space for his doctor, chiropractor,
  chef and security detail. Ironically, guests here are likely to come with
  bigger retinues than even the ambassador would have had. The maximalism
  reaches an absurdist conclusion on the roof, home to a pair of 350 sq m
  penthouses, named Elizabeth and Charles, with rates topping £20,000 a night.
  “We’ve included subtle touches that reflect the royals’ interests,” the
  stylist tells me, as she curates a cluster of ornaments. “We have artwork
  relating to the queen’s brooches and love of dogs, while Charles House had
  nods to polo and Highgrove.” Sadly missing is a framed 2009 letter from
  Charles to the Qataris, expressing his fury over their choice of architect for
  their previous London mega-project, at Chelsea Barracks. If only he had
  similarly intervened here to insist they retained Chipperfield for the
  interiors. That said, it is hard to imagine Sir David coming up with something
  as magnificently gaudy as the Eagle Bar on the roof. Conceived as an
  end-of-days art deco-ish fantasy, with a swooping multicurved ceiling, the bar
  looks out at the back of the gilded American eagle sculpture that has always
  crowned the embassy. For the first time, standing out on the terrace, you can
  see up close how this patriotic symbol of America’s strength and freedom is in
  fact made from trash – pieced together from leftover bits of B-52 bombers,
  forming a sinewy pile of scrap metal, daubed with gold paint.
