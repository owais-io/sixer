  There is a row of hills north of the Black Mountains, close to the
  English-Welsh border, that is full of wildflower meadows. If you lie down
  among the yellow rattle and the bird’s-foot trefoil and gaze across the sward,
  you can see marsh orchids poking above the grasses like mini pagodas. Down in
  the valley, the River Monnow cascades east, and above is the Cefn, a boggy old
  drovers’ road that follows the ridge. It was on the Cefn that several marbled
  white butterflies hurtled past me like a peloton of cyclists, then appeared to
  swerve around the ghosts of old drovers. The upper sides of the adults wings
  are a vivid pied pattern of embroidery. The undersides are more hazy, and Joan
  Miró-like. I know the farmers, Simon and Anita, whose land they danced over,
  and I was excited to tell them. Their farm is an upland holding where rare
  breed pigs, such as Sandy and Blacks, turn over the bracken to release dormant
  seeds. White park cattle, carefully managed, perform a similar task, stirring
  up the ground without over-poaching. They also have a lowland farm, which I
  had visited earlier that day. Here, the fields are planted with heritage
  cereals, and instead of spraying off anything that is not the crop, Simon lets
  it all grow together. Consequently, the fields are full of herbs such as
  common vetch, with its deep roots, and the lanky blue flowers of chicory,
  which fixes nitrogen. It all helps to maintain the soil’s health. Soon the
  crop will be harvested, and the heritage grains will be separated from the
  herbs and grasses by an ancient French grain cleaner. It’s a wonderful old
  contraption. When Simon flicked a switch, it came alive, a great, grumbling
  drum with chutes coming off the side for the different sizes of seed. The
  grains will then be milled for flour which goes out to small-scale bakeries
  across the country. By treating the soil with affection, they are building up
  a rich humus for future generations, not degrading it. This is food production
  as a liberating, creative act, giving natural systems the freedom to flourish.
