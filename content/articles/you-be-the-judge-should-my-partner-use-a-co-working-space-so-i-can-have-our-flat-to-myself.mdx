  The prosecution: Claire I want him to work away from the flat so we keep a
  healthy relationship and avoid a couple bubble Before Xavier moved into my
  flat in a sunny European city, I lived alone for three years. Ahead of him
  moving in, I said we could live together but that he needed to find somewhere
  else to work so we weren’t on top of each other. We’d both moved here from
  other countries, and I think it’s healthy to carry on meeting people and not
  just live in a couple bubble. I asked him to find a co-working space to help
  us keep a balanced, healthy relationship. Also, when I wake up, I don’t want
  to speak for a while. Because I work remotely for a client who doesn’t need me
  until 1pm, my mornings are my solo time. Having Xavier in my flat all day
  every day isn’t an option. My job is 90% calls, so it had to be him that left.
  Also, it’s my flat, and he was the one who proposed moving in. Luckily, we are
  super compatible as flatmates, but this was my condition. I like to have
  different spaces for work, sleep and socialising, but Xavier doesn’t think
  like that. He can get up, start work straight away at the kitchen table and
  then leave the house when he’s done. He likes to do all his work-related
  activities indoors, then socialise outdoors. It took Xavier a while to commit
  to a co-working space. Before that, he was hanging around at home. One day, a
  month after we started living together, he wanted to take a call at the flat.
  I said it was fine, but actually it was annoying. Later, we had to have a
  conversation about why I was irritated, and he joined a co-working space right
  after that. I like to talk about issues that arise right away, whereas Xavier
  will avoid things and hope they’ll disappear. I need to be understood, whereas
  he can just suppress things. Luckily, there are no other issues between us
  when it comes to living together. But I think it’s important to have
  boundaries. Xavier can work from home occasionally, but I’d prefer it if he
  stuck to the routine and came back in the afternoon while I’m working and not
  when I want to relax alone in the morning. It’s important to have separation
  as a couple. The defence: Xavier I’m more productive working from home. I wake
  up, have a coffee and start straight away About a month after I moved into
  Claire’s flat, she told me I needed to go to a co-working space. We both work
  remotely, and when I moved in she did mention this stipulation. We’ve only
  been dating a year, and she didn’t want us to be on top of each other. I
  dragged my heels because I’d never been to a co-working space; I’d always
  worked at home. I’m more productive that way. I wake up, have a coffee and
  start work straight away. I like starting early and finishing by 2 or 3pm, and
  having my own space, with my food, snacks and a toilet all close by. Claire
  starts at 1pm, so I originally thought: great I’ll work in our flat until she
  needs the office, and pop into a co-working space now and again. But then,
  about 10 days into this routine, she sat me down and said it wasn’t working,
  that she wanted me to work outside of the flat consistently. So now I have to
  pack my bag, walk to a co-working space, and speak to people, all because
  Claire wants me out. I don’t like it. I get up at 7am and my productivity
  starts at 100%. Every little thing I do before working detracts from that – it
  drops off bit by bit. Claire said she wanted her space in the mornings. She
  doesn’t talk much, whereas I am a morning person. I didn’t think I was
  disturbing her, but she said it was more about having space to just exist away
  from me in the day. I wasn’t offended, but I didn’t like having to find a
  co-working spot right away. I needed to work out what I liked and what I
  wanted out of one – it’s not easy. I tried one place and it was way too
  social. Everyone said “hi” every five minutes, and my productivity was
  affected. Claire is a very open communicator, and I’m glad she told me she
  wanted me out of the flat. And I have managed to find a more corporate,
  soulless co-working space that is less sociable and suits me. In some ways, my
  working there makes our lives more interesting, because I come home with news
  about my day. But sometimes I wish I had a bit more freedom to be in the flat
  because it’s my home, too. The jury of Guardian readers Should Xavier let
  Claire have the space to herself? Claire wants Xavier to live on her terms and
  offers no flexibility. The mention of “her flat” makes it feel as if she
  hasn’t embraced living together as a couple. He is asking for more freedom in
  his own home, which seems a reasonable request. Robbie, 35 If working
  elsewhere was a condition of moving in, Xavier needs to stick to it. But
  Claire needs to remember that this is Xavier’s home too now – he’s allowed to
  be there during the day. Flexibility on her side would help ease this issue.
  Rose, 40 There seems to be a disparity in the equality dynamic and a
  disconnect in the relationship harmony. Claire is pulling rank because it’s
  “her flat” and seems to be insinuating that her needs are more important than
  his so Xavier should change. Compromise is called for. Naomi, 72 Covid taught
  us that spending 24 hours together is not healthy, particularly for a
  relatively new couple. Claire could compromise and agree on some occasions
  when Xavier can work from home, but I am with her when she talks about needing
  space and quiet in the morning. Silvia, 53 It doesn’t seem as if it would take
  long for Xavier to walk to his work space, so I don’t buy the argument that
  every second wasted between waking and working drains him of productivity. It
  also sounds a bit awful to have your boyfriend get up at 7am and start working
  on your kitchen table. Alone time is good for a couple. Matthew, 48 Now you be
  the judge In our online poll, tell us if you think Xavier should pack his bags
  and go to work. The poll closes on Wednesday 13 August at 9am BST Last week’s
  results We asked whether Wes should stop drinking from a water bladder while
  having sex with his girlfriend 89% of you said yes – Wes is guilty 11% of you
  said no – Wes is not guilty
