  It is one of my very earliest concert memories. In October 1965, my father
  drove us to Manchester to hear Mstislav Rostropovich play in the Free Trade
  Hall. Rostropovich played Dvořák’s cello concerto with the Moscow
  Philharmonic, who began the concert with a symphony by Tikhon Khrennikov and
  ended it with one by Brahms. I was smitten by Rostropovich’s noble playing. I
  had never heard a musician like him before. This was, though, a concert taking
  place slap-bang in the middle of the cold war. The Cuban missile crisis had
  taken place less than three years earlier. The Berlin Wall was still fairly
  new. The Vietnam war was deepening. That summer I had read The Spy Who Came in
  from the Cold. The movie version of Le Carré’s novel, with Richard Burton, was
  due out by the year’s end. So a concert visit by a Soviet orchestra, opening
  their programme with a piece by a notorious Soviet cultural apparatchik, and
  featuring a superstar cellist whose oppositional support for human rights was
  at that stage not widely known, certainly not by me, but whose biography
  casually mentioned his award of a Stalin prize, was a freighted event. It
  could have been depicted as a visit from the enemy, and certainly as a
  political act as well as an artistic one. Be clear that politics were
  undoubtedly involved. The Soviet Union would have weighed the risk of
  triggering another high-profile defection – it was only four years since
  Rudolf Nureyev’s sensational escape to the west – but must have judged the
  visit nevertheless as a worthwhile expression of what we now call soft power.
  Before issuing visas the UK authorities would certainly have thought about all
  these implications, too. And so will many in the audience before buying
  tickets. My communist father, for example, was a great music lover, and we had
  Rostropovich’s recording of the Dvořák concerto at home on LP. But I am sure
  he bought tickets at least in part to show support for Soviet visitors, and
  because he wanted to help promote detente between Britain and the Soviet
  Union. Yet as far as I recall it, there were no protests outside or inside the
  Free Trade Hall. Maybe I missed them or have forgotten them. If so, I
  apologise. But their absence will not surprise those who lived through these
  years. The 1960s were years of an almost total standoff with Russia and all
  the iron curtain countries in most respects. Travel in either direction was
  off limits to ordinary people on either side of the divide. But cultural links
  always existed. In spite of the occasional defection, there were regular
  visits by Soviet musicians and dancers – and even tours by the Red Army
  Ensemble – throughout the cold war years. Among the Soviet artists who gave
  regular concerts in the west were Sviatoslav Richter, David and Igor Oistrakh,
  Emil Gilels, Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Rostropovich. Among the westerners who
  triumphed in Moscow were Leonard Bernstein, Glenn Gould and our own John
  Ogdon. And while a London recital by Richter or Oistrakh could be wholly free
  of political resonance, a visit by Dmitri Shostakovich, sitting in the Soviet
  ambassador’s box at the Royal Festival Hall for the UK premiere of his 15th
  Symphony, which I witnessed in 1972, was far more officially charged. Yet do I
  regret hearing any of them? Not at all. How times have changed. Last week, the
  Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Prom was held up by pro-Palestinian protests in
  the Albert Hall. Next week the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is due to sing
  the title role in a new Covent Garden production of Puccini’s Tosca. The
  prospect of protests is very real there, too. Netrebko rose to artistic
  greatness in the early years of Putin’s Russia, where she was the star soprano
  of Valery Gergiev’s Mariinsky Opera in St Petersburg, and she was much feted,
  including by Putin. Nevertheless, within days of the Russian invasion of
  Ukraine three and a half years ago, Netrebko put out a statement of
  condemnation, the very opposite of Gergiev. She even used the word “war” which
  is officially taboo in Russia. She has not returned to Russia from her home in
  Austria since the invasion. Yet Netrebko’s participation in the Tosca
  production has rekindled a debate about whether she should be taking part at
  all and whether the Royal Opera House was right to hire her. It seems likely
  that Netrebko’s appearance will continue to be a news story, a source of
  public debate and of social-media furore. Demonstrations outside Covent Garden
  are certainly planned, and it is regrettably not out of the question that
  protests inside the house will occur, too. Very obviously, we live in
  extremely different times in 2025 from those of 1965 when Rostropovich came to
  Manchester. Some of the issues, though, have powerful echoes. No one seriously
  argues that the arts can or should be a politics-free zone. The arts and
  politics are bound to mix to a degree, just as sport and politics are also
  bound to. A concert tour by a Soviet orchestra during the cold war was
  inescapably political. But it was also right that it took place, and was
  allowed to proceed. It undoubtedly did some good. We should also never forget
  that not all Russians were or are supporters of Stalin or Putin, just as not
  all white South Africans were supporters of apartheid and not all Israelis are
  supporters of Netanyahu. Neither the Royal Opera House nor Netrebko has,
  however, shown the pragmatic sensitivity that today’s complicated dispute
  demands. In some people’s view, Covent Garden’s hiring of a Russian soprano
  when her country is killing Ukrainians is completely unacceptable. But that
  has to be weighed against the fact that Netrebko has opposed, not supported
  the invasion, and that, in any event, she is a great artist and not a
  politician. The arts and politics are not the same thing. The arts have
  meaning far beyond politics. Boycotts are a dangerous denial of that truth.
  Save in very exceptional circumstances, such as when we are at war as a
  nation, we risk demeaning what ultimately we stand for if we refuse to allow
  an artist their freedom to express themselves. Denying an artist like Netrebko
  her voice – and what a voice it is – because of her nationality, her
  ethnicity, or her views, real or supposed, is a course that we take not just
  at her peril, but at our own.
