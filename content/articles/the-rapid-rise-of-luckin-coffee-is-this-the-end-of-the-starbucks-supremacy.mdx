  Name: Luckin. Age: Seven – it was founded in October 2017. Appearance: 20,000
  locations and counting. Locations doing what? Serving coffee. It’s a giant
  coffee chain. Oh yeah? If it’s so giant, how come I’ve never heard of it?
  Because it started in China. Isn’t China better known for tea? Yes, but they
  have drunk a lot more coffee since Starbucks opened its first outlets there in
  1999. Luckin overtook Starbucks as China’s biggest coffee chain in 2023. If
  Chinese people want Chinese coffee, so be it. It’s a big world. Luckin knows
  that, which is why it has just opened up two outlets in New York City, on
  Starbucks’ doorstep. It’s aiming for global domination? It certainly looks
  like it. “This is just the beginning,” Luckin posted on Instagram. “NYC, we’re
  here.” But why would I go to Luckin when I can go to Starbucks? For a largely
  frictionless technological experience. It has an app-based ordering system, no
  cashiers and hardly any seats. You just grab your latte and go. Is the coffee
  any better? If you really cared about coffee, you wouldn’t go to either of
  these places. But Starbucks is home of the caramel macchiato, the pumpkin
  spice latte … Luckin is known for bestsellers like the coconut latte, the
  velvet latte and apple fizzy americano. Apple what? That’s apple juice, fizzy
  water and coffee, over ice. What is Starbucks doing to fend off the Luckin
  threat? It is closing a bunch of stores. A bold strategy, if a little
  counterintuitive. The company plans to phase out its 90 or so
  “mobile-order-only” locations in the US, to concentrate on “community coffee
  houses” and a more personal customer experience. So it’s going in the exact
  opposite direction to Luckin. It seems so. It has plans to refurbish existing
  locations, and it is going back to writing your name on the cup. A warm,
  friendly, welcoming atmosphere versus zero human interaction? I’m torn. If it
  helps you make up your mind, Luckin is also engaging in furious promotional
  discounting, selling $1.99 coffees in a city where a $6 cappuccino is not
  uncommon. Starbucks is doomed. That’s a little premature. Luckin reported
  $4.7bn in sales last year, compared with $36.2bn net revenue for Starbucks.
  Still, a remarkable rise for the Chinese upstart. All the more remarkable
  after a 2020 false accounting scandal caused its stock price to collapse,
  driving the company into bankruptcy in the US. It emerged from bankruptcy in
  2022, having replaced its top brass and received huge cash injections from a
  private equity firm. Do say: “Good morning, young barista. One of your
  legendary handcrafted flat whites, please.” Don’t say: “You know what I miss?
  Vending machines.”
