  Microplastics are everywhere, even in human testicles. So will the patriarchy
  finally step in? | Van Badham

  There is plastic in your balls! Surely this should be headline news every day
  until the news breaks that “there is no longer plastic in your balls”,
  accompanied by photographs of celebration parades and ecstatic couples kissing
  in the streets. It shouldn’t require the “angle” of a global plastic pollution
  treaty conference this week to edge it back into the media. It shouldn’t
  oblige a report in medical journal the Lancet on Sunday revealing that the
  health effects of plastic in the environment are “causing disease and death
  from infancy to old age” and are responsible for at least US$1.5tn every year
  in health-related damages. It should only require you looking at your own
  balls or – with consent – the balls of someone you truly, deeply love and
  value, then realising, holy shit, there are microplastics in there. Of course,
  maybe you live your life balls-free – but perhaps you know a dog? If that dog
  has balls, then I have terrible news: the scientists who found microplastic
  particles in every single human testicle in their study found them in all the
  dogs’ balls, too. Patriarchy, not for the first time, you have seriously let
  me down. Raised from birth in western society, I have been passively
  inculcated with a relentless message that protecting your balls was our most
  important collective priority. Freud insisted that male identity was so rooted
  in the symbolism of aggressively functional genitalia that “castration
  anxiety” mobilised men into behaviours of dominance, control and whatever
  other compensatory masculine unpleasantness Donald Trump got up to this
  morning. When the boss was “busting your balls”, it was bad. If a situation
  “had you by the balls” it was bad. When a woman was a “ball-busting bitch”,
  she was unforgivable. “Genital theft panic” is an actual term used by actual
  anthropologists to describe the social terror of something nefarious stealing
  function from your soft bits when you’re not looking. So, here I was thinking,
  “Ah, yes, I don’t expect the patriarchy to care that scientists have found
  synthetic plastics in blood, placenta and breast milk, contributing to
  placental dysfunction, ovarian atrophy, endometrial hyperplasia and fibrosis
  in women – because I’m a feminist with pattern recognition. I don’t expect the
  patriarchy gives much more thought to the plastic pollution of waterways, the
  poisoning of animals, or the fact that there has been a trash island named the
  North Atlantic Garbage Patch – now hundreds of kilometres across – growing in
  the ocean since 1972. But now that there are microplastics in your balls with
  considerable evidence suggesting they are reducing your sperm count, inflaming
  your tissues and affecting both your and our species’ fertility, surely some
  good old-fashioned genital theft panic will kick in and patriarchy will
  aggressively – with much swagger – ride in to save what it holds dear. I
  repeat – you’ve let me down. Because, given the opportunity to literally save
  your own balls, you’ve instead defaulted to a significantly less useful habit
  of “bullying people who utter uncomfortable truths” at conferences whenever
  the plastic problem is mentioned. Experts trying to communicate to the world
  that the projected tripling of plastic products by 2060 is a catastrophically
  dumbarse idea say they have been yelled at, harassed and intimidated by
  representatives of petrochemical lobbies and petrostates who make money from
  the ubiquitous fossil fuel-based pollution product. This is the sixth attempt
  at a plastic pollution treaty since plastic started turning up in brains,
  livers, kidneys, blood, joints and your balls, and the UN decided “hey, maybe
  this is a problem?” back in 2022. The previous five attempts have failed. Well
  may some men fear that the radical humanity of feminism will deprive them of
  status, power and even identity – but it’s not the sisterhood busting your
  balls, fellas. It’s chiefly the fossil-fuel interests of usual suspects like
  China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US in the form of 460m tonnes of
  synthetic garbage spewed on to the planet every year. Now microplastics are
  found everywhere from the peak of Mt Everest to the depths of the Mariana
  Trench. Lord Howe Island is a volcanic rock island about 600km off the
  Australian east coast governed under a conservation authority applying strict
  visitor controls, and if you squeeze the muttonbirds there (please don’t),
  they are so full of plastic that they crunch. They crunch. Male persons,
  please consider the comparable fate awaiting your balls if the new treaty
  fails – because those universally plasticised testes from the aforementioned
  study that should have sent every red-blooded testicle-cherisher across
  humanity racing for a global ban and immediate cleanup operation were
  retrieved from people who had died before 2016. Even more plastic has been
  pumped into the planet since then – and for what? In the majority of cases,
  single-use plastics used for packaging, drink and food containers. Less than
  10% of plastic is recycled. I want you to remember this, men, the next time
  you stare at a shelf of juicy shrink-wrapped capsicum at the supermarket. I
  want you to ask, “what is the trade-off for this?”, and to consider the global
  plastic pollution treaty, and your balls. If patriarchy isn’t coming to save
  them, then maybe you should? • Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist.
