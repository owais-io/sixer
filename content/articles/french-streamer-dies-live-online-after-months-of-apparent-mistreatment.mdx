  French authorities are investigating the death of a man during a live video
  stream on the Kick platform, where he had regularly been shown enduring
  violence and humiliation. Prosecutors ordered an autopsy and opened an
  investigation into the death of the man, 46, in the village of Contes, north
  of Nice, on Monday. France’s junior minister for AI and digital technology,
  Clara Chappaz, said Raphael Graven, known online as Jean Pormanove, had
  featured regularly in videos on Kick, where he was physically assaulted or
  humiliated by co-streamers as viewers watched live. “The death of Jean
  Pormanove and the violence he suffered are absolutely horrific,” Chappaz wrote
  on X. Kick Français said it would cooperate with authorities and was
  undertaking a review of its French content. “Our priority is to protect
  creators and ensure a safer environment on Kick,” it wrote on X. “All
  co-streamers who participated in this live broadcast have been banned pending
  the ongoing investigation.” Kick is a live-streaming platform registered in
  Australia that shares revenue with its content creators. Chappaz said a
  judicial investigation was under way and that she had referred the matter to
  digital and audiovisual communication regulator Arcom and filed a report to
  Pharos, France’s internet portal for reporting illicit internet content. She
  also said she had asked Kick for explanations. “The responsibility of online
  platforms for dissemination of illegal content is not optional, it is the
  law,” she said. Yassin Sadouni, a lawyer for one of two co-streamers seen
  abusing Pormanove, told BFM television the victim had cardiovascular problems
  and that the violence in the videos was acted. “All those scenes are just
  staged, they follow a script,” he said. French media have shown excerpts of
  hours-long videos during which Pormanove is seen suffering blows, insults,
  strangulation, dousing with paint and oil and being shot at with a paintball
  gun. It was not clear from the excerpts whether Pormanove had subjected
  himself to the violence voluntarily or was forced to endure it, nor whether
  the action was real or staged.
