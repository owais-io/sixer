  Our world is full of grifters. Or so it seems, considering how often that word
  is thrown around in public life these days. This year alone, Zarah Sultana,
  the former Labour MP and founder of a new left party with Jeremy Corbyn,
  called the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, a “billionaire-backed grifter”
  (perhaps borrowing from the language of Coutts staff who referred to him as a
  “disingenuous grifter” when his bank account was closed two years ago).
  Sultana, in turn, was accused of being a “grifter” duping “honest socialists”
  by the journalist Paul Mason. When giving evidence at the Covid inquiry, the
  Spectator editor and former cabinet minister, Michael Gove, called the lawyer
  Jolyon Maugham, whose Good Law Project campaign group pursued PPE contract
  cases, a “politically motivated grifter”. Meanwhile, the journalist and author
  James Ball accused the New York University history professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat of
  “resistance grift” for suggesting the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy
  Jr, is trying to control the population by spreading disease. In a recent
  podcast, the Atlantic writer David Frum called Donald Trump’s presidency the
  “grift machine”, while the US president was also called “grifter-in-chief” by
  Florida congressman Maxwell Frost. Two years ago, it was the Sussexes who were
  memorably called “fucking grifters” by Spotify’s head of podcast innovation,
  Bill Simmons, after their multiyear deal with the platform ended after just 12
  episodes. From 2017-24, the written use of the word “grifter” has more than
  doubled, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). But over the past
  few months in particular, it has been striking how often the term – both
  grifter and grift – is cropping up in our political discourse. In April this
  year, it made its debut in parliament: it was used in a House of Commons
  debate on the impact of digital platforms on democracy by the Liberal Democrat
  MP for Cheltenham, Max Wilkinson. “You find a mad and hateful narrative. You
  tell everyone it is free speech, and before you know it, you might be lucky
  enough to become a successful online grifter with your top off,” he said.
  “Perhaps you will be an MP, or maybe even the president of America.”
  “Grifter”, according to the OED, is a variant of the US slang “grafter”:
  someone who “makes money by shady or dishonest means; a thief; a swindler” –
  or “one who practises ‘graft’, especially in public life; a politician,
  official, etc, who misuses his or her position in order to reap dishonest gain
  or advantage”. That second meaning has clearly captured the political
  zeitgeist. “It’s a kind of shorthand for inviting suspicion about the methods
  and motivations of someone with an opposing viewpoint,” Fiona McPherson, an
  executive editor at the OED, told me. Why is it that we’re not only
  disagreeing with our political opponents, but assuming they are con artists
  somehow profiting from what we deem to be their bad opinions, policies and
  rhetorical style? Spivs who are in it for nefarious ends rather than simply
  wrong-headed? When you search the term “grifter” on sites such as Reddit and
  TikTok, it is often used in relation to influencers – wellness gurus, pickup
  artists, life coaches, crypto bros. So many online subcultures now dabble in
  essentially the same business model: sowing insecurity and then charging
  people with the promise to rid them of it. Wherever the algorithm leads you,
  from sleep coaches for knackered new mums to gym rats for lonely boys, you are
  likely being exposed, day in, day out, to some form of grift. When politicians
  themselves mimic such influencers – Farage and the shadow justice secretary,
  Robert Jenrick, for example, now trade in to-camera vertical videos that gain
  millions of views – it is hard to ignore the similarities. Suspicions of
  British politicians’ motives in general are high, sparked by the 2009 expenses
  scandal and intensifying over the past few years of crony Covid contracts and
  ministers bagging freebies. The rise of the “true scam” genre also reveals our
  morbid fascination with grift. From the Tinder Swindler to Fyre festival, and
  Theranos to the Captain Tom Foundation, stories of the hubris and humiliation
  of people perceived to be on the make with our money dominate TV
  documentaries, long-form journalism and investigative podcasts. All this and
  you can barely open your banking app today without warnings about the
  nefarious means used by scammers to winkle money out of you. Fraud is the most
  common crime in England and Wales, with the highest number of cases recorded
  last year. In the resulting atmosphere of ambient paranoia, perhaps it’s
  little wonder we’re on the lookout for “grifters” – and why the insult appears
  to resonate. So welcome to the Age of Grift: if you’re not spotting it, you’re
  probably on the end of it. Anoosh Chakelian is Britain editor of the New
  Statesman
