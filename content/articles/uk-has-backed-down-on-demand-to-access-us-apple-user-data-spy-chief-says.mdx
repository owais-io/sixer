  The UK government has dropped its insistence that Apple allows law enforcement
  officials “backdoor” access to US customer data, Donald Trump’s spy chief,
  Tulsi Gabbard, says. The US director of national intelligence posted the claim
  on X following a months-long dispute embroiling the iPhone manufacturer, the
  UK government and the US president. Trump had weighed in to accuse Britain of
  behaving like China, telling the prime minister, Keir Starmer: “You can’t do
  this”. Neither the Home Office nor Apple are commenting on the alleged
  agreement, which Gabbard said meant the UK was no longer demanding that Apple
  “provide a ‘backdoor’ that would have enabled access to the protected
  encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties”.
  The transatlantic row began when the Home Office issued a “technical
  capability notice” to Apple under the Investigatory Powers Act, which requires
  companies to assist law enforcement in providing evidence. Apple responded by
  launching a legal challenge, which the Home Office demanded be kept secret but
  judges ordered be made public. The US vice-president, JD Vance, also
  complained saying: “I don’t want American citizens to be spied on.” He said it
  was “crazy” that “we’re creating a backdoor in our own technology networks
  that our enemies are now using”. Civil liberties groups cautioned that the
  backdoor would put politicians, campaigners and minority groups at particular
  risk of being targeted. In February, Apple responded by withdrawing the option
  for its new British customers to enable advance data protection options,
  saying it was “deeply disappointed” and would never build a backdoor into any
  of its products. That meant, uniquely, many UK customers were unable to
  benefit from end-to-end encryption of services, including the iCloud Drive,
  photos, notes or reminders, making them more vulnerable to data breaches.
  Gabbard said: “Over the past few months, I’ve been working closely with our
  partners in the UK, alongside President Trump and Vice-President Vance, to
  ensure Americans’ private data remains private and our constitutional rights
  and civil liberties are protected.” It is not clear whether the technical
  capability notice requiring the data access would be withdrawn altogether or
  altered. It could in theory be limited to allowing access to the data only of
  UK citizens, although experts cautioned that could be technologically
  unrealistic. It also raises the danger that other foreign governments could
  still find a way to use the backdoor. Neither is it clear whether Apple will
  be able to offer new UK customers access to its highest levels of data
  protection again. The Home Office refused to confirm Gabbard’s claim, saying:
  “We do not comment on operational matters, including confirming or denying the
  existence of such notices. We have long had joint security and intelligence
  arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats, such as terrorism
  and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in
  enabling those threats.” It added: “Those arrangements have long contained
  safeguards to protect privacy and sovereignty: for example the data access
  agreement includes critical safeguards to prevent the UK and US from targeting
  the data of each other’s citizens. We will continue to build on those
  arrangements and we will also continue to maintain a strong security framework
  to ensure that we can continue to pursue terrorists and serious criminals
  operating in the UK. We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic
  level to keep UK citizens safe.” The UK-US data access agreement allows UK
  agencies to submit requests for content of communications directly to
  communications service providers, including social media platforms and
  messaging services, in the US, but this must be for the purpose of
  investigating, preventing, detecting, and prosecuting serious crime, officials
  said. Apple was approached for comment.
