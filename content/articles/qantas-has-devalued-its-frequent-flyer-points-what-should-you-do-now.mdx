  Qantas was back in the spotlight this week with news that affected members of
  its frequent flyer program. The airline has made significant changes to its
  loyalty program, effectively devaluing its frequent flyer points. While we
  don’t know the full extent or the specifics of the changes, airline loyalty
  program experts estimate a 20% average increase in the number of points needed
  to redeem a seat. Qantas has given us a few examples, including that a Classic
  Rewards economy seat on a Sydney-Melbourne flight has risen to 9,200 points
  plus $55 in fees, from 8,000 points plus $55 in fees. So, will the Qantas
  promise of more rewards seats available to flyers make the additional expense
  worth it? Or are people better off spending their points on shopping instead
  of flights? Sign up: AU Breaking News email Why has Qantas done this? Flagging
  the changes in January, the chief executive officer of the frequent flyer
  program, Andrew Glance, said: “A lot has changed in the last six years.” He
  suggested the changes would mean the airline could increase the number of
  Classic Rewards and Classic Plus Rewards seats available to be booked with
  frequent flyer points. Qantas has for some time fielded complaints about the
  scarcity of Classic Rewards seats in general, especially in premium classes.
  The airline has acknowledged the changes would force many members to spend
  more points and more cash on fees. However, Qantas said it hadn’t adjusted the
  value of its loyalty scheme since 2019, and that the August changes were only
  the second since 2004. Daniel Sciberras, who works for the guide website Point
  Hacks, says the latest increase is “relatively reasonable”, even if customers
  aren’t happy about it, because the program “needs to remain viable”. In his
  view, this is because the average 15% to 20% jump in the number of points
  needed to book flights works out to about a 2% to 3% rise a year since 2019 –
  roughly in line with inflation. What should I do with my points now? The
  specifics of what each Classic Rewards seat will cost under the new scheme
  have not yet been revealed. However, Sciberras says his tips for consumers in
  general haven’t changed. He says there’s no difference to “the general rule” –
  that redeeming points for premium seats on long-haul fights is the “best bang
  for your point”. “So, you’re still going to get great value when it comes to
  flights, especially in those long-haul premium cabins.” He says people are
  generally better off redeeming points on business-class seats than paying for
  an economy seat and using points to get an upgrade. His advice remains the
  same when it comes to domestic bookings too: use your points on routes with
  less competition. Sciberras says this is because busy domestic routes with
  lots of competition – such as flights between Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide –
  generally have lower ticket prices. The amount of points needed to redeem a
  seat is fixed, and based on distance, he says. This means you’re better off
  using points to book domestic flights that would otherwise be more expensive,
  such as to destinations like Hamilton Island, Uluru or Broome. Am I better off
  spending my points on things other than flights? Not if you want to get the
  best value for money, Sciberras says. “You’re always going to get more value
  by redeeming your points for flights than other things: accommodation, car
  hire, anything from the shopping mall,” he says. This is because points – when
  worked out in dollar terms – end up being worth more when used to book
  flights, he says. Sciberras says points usually work out to be about 1c in
  value when used to book flights. “But … if you want to get a $50 gift card,
  it’ll be like 10,000 points, right? That gives you half a cent in value,” he
  says. “Short-haul domestic might be only around 0.7c per point, so it’s not
  much more. But if you’re going international first class, you could get 4c or
  5c in value, or even more per point.”
