  Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has been infiltrating Australia over
  years to surveil and harass members of the Iranian-Australian community,
  critics of the Tehran regime have consistently told the Australian government.
  Hundreds of Iranian Australians made submissions to a Senate inquiry three
  years ago saying embassy officials and Revolutionary Guards were monitoring,
  intimidating and threatening members of the diaspora and begging the
  government to proscribe the IRGC. The Coalition lashed Labor for not listing
  the IRCG as a terrorist organisation in 2023 and said it was ready to vote to
  do so today. In question time on Wednesday, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley,
  challenged Anthony Albanese over why he did not act sooner “when the warnings
  were so clear and the risks so grave”. The shadow home affairs minister,
  Andrew Hastie, conceded though that while he had been “keen” to list the IRCG
  when he was chair of the intelligence committee before the 2022 election,
  there were mixed views within the Coalition government at the time. On
  Tuesday, Asio said it had credible evidence that IRGC commanders were
  ultimately behind at least two – but likely more – antisemitic attacks in
  Australia last year: arson attacks on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne
  and the Lewis Continental Kitchen kosher restaurant in Sydney. In response,
  the federal government expelled the Iranian ambassador and said it would
  legislate to proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. There was no
  accusation current Iranian diplomats or embassy staff were involved. Dr Kylie
  Moore-Gilbert, a British-Australian academic who had been held for 804 days by
  the IRGC, most of it in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, told the Guardian that
  diaspora members lived their lives in Australia for years “looking over their
  shoulders”. “We know that there are a number of agents of the IRGC and of the
  Iranian regime here in Australia, as well as sympathisers and informants,
  people who might not be paid, trained agents, but who are feeding information
  back to Tehran on the Iranian-Australian community.” Moore-Gilbert said agents
  were monitoring dissidents and refugees who have been critical of the Iranian
  government, and were also watching and filming people participating in
  protests. “I’ve experienced it,” Moore-Gilbert said, “and I know so many
  Iranian-Australians who have so many stories about threatening behaviour and
  being surveilled and followed”. After the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman
  Mahsa (Jina) Amini at the hands of Iran’s morality police in 2022 and the
  resulting worldwide protest movement, Woman Life Freedom, a Senate inquiry
  heard evidence of widespread surveillance and intimidation by the Iranian
  regime on Australian soil. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Senate inquiry
  received more than 1,100 submissions, hundreds of which had to be put on the
  record anonymously, citing fear of reprisals. One submitter said embassy
  officials were “likely to be involved in infiltration, intimidation and
  harassment of Australian residents or citizens, and acts of terrorism”. “These
  individuals, under diplomatic cover, pose a threat to our security. Embassy
  personnel filmed protesters … in Australia during demonstrations, intimidated
  and harassed Australian citizens here, or their families in Iran. “In one
  case, the consular sector of the Iranian embassy in Canberra denied providing
  service to an Iranian-Australian and threatened him about the consequences he
  would face for participating in the demonstrations in Canberra.” Setareh
  Vaziri cited the case of one Iranian-Australian woman who “upon voicing
  opposition to the Iranian regime was faced with anonymous threatening text
  messages, and whose family – still in Iran – were threatened with violence if
  she did not remain ‘silent’.” Vaziri gave evidence to the committee that
  Iranian-Australians critical of the Tehran government had had their emails
  hacked and their social media accounts duplicated “to manipulate the work of
  activists”. Dr Behzad Molavi told the committee: “the Islamic Republic of Iran
  regime has planted informants, apologists, and infiltrators from among their
  family members, cronies and affiliates in Australia who are mostly active in
  the ‘cultural and religious centres’ or at the universities and scholarly
  institutes. “They play a major role in harassing, intimidating, and silencing
  dissenting voices of dual nationals.” The Department of Home Affairs gave
  evidence to the committee it was “aware of reports that pro-Iranian government
  informants are surveilling former Iranian residents protesting against the
  regime in Australia and threatening their relatives in Iran as a result”. Sara
  Zahedi, a lawyer and member of Woman Life Freedom Australia, told the
  committee members of the Iranian-Australian community had consistently
  reported incidents of harassment and intimidation. “What we would really like
  to see is these concerns being taken a little bit more seriously by the AFP …
  we’re not getting a lot of follow-up on our questions and our concerns with
  regard to being harassed and being watched. “I don’t think we should be
  waiting for incidents of violence before we see some serious action being
  taken.” The Senate committee recommended that Australia list the IRGC as a
  terrorist organisation and said it should be prepared to expel any diplomats
  who are engaged in “intimidation, threats, or monitoring of Australians”.
  Former senator and transparency advocate Rex Patrick obtained documents under
  freedom of information laws in January this year, showing the government
  sought legal advice on proscribing the IRGC in 2023 but determined that
  because the IRGC was a part of the Iranian state, it could not be banned under
  existing legislation. The government is now moving to proscribe the IRGC as a
  terror group under changes to the federal criminal code to include
  state-linked organisations. Drafting is already under way but the home affairs
  minister, Tony Burke, says the government will take the appropriate time to
  amend the rules for groups like the IRCG to be prescribed. The code defines
  terror groups as organisations that are directly or indirectly engaged in,
  preparing, planning, assisting or fostering terrorist acts. Challenged over
  the delay in listing the IRGC, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told
  question time on Wednesday the government had acted “like adults” on the
  decision. “On these issues, we take advice from the intelligence agencies, we
  go through our appropriate processes, including our national security
  committee,” he said. Iran’s government finds itself further isolated in the
  wake of the revelations it was behind the arson attacks in Australia. But
  Moore-Gilbert told the Guardian that, from the perspective of the
  Revolutionary Guards, the attacks “have succeeded, to a certain extent, in
  creating division within the community in Australia and in heightening
  antisemitic sentiments in Australia”. “And they’ve been doing this elsewhere
  as well. It’s not that it’s restricted to just Australia. It seems to be a
  broader strategy to do this throughout the western world.” Moore-Gilbert said
  having spent hundreds of hours under interrogation by the Revolutionary Guard
  Corps, she had witnessed their virulent antisemitism. “It’s difficult for them
  to target Israel, it’s difficult for them to go into Israeli territory, but
  Jewish communities in western countries who are just peacefully going about
  their lives, they’re an easy target.”
