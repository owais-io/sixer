  The Albanese government has promised to cut red tape and fast-track
  environmental approvals for new homes in an effort to address Australia’s
  housing crisis. On Saturday, the government announced plans to pause further
  residential changes to the National Construction Code and to streamline the
  assessment of more than 26,000 homes under the Environment Protection and
  Biodiversity Conservation Act. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  announcement follows the economic reform roundtable this week, at which
  housing was a focus. According to the government, there was broad consensus
  that “commonsense changes could reduce the regulatory burden for builders and
  boost housing supply”. “For too many builders in Australia, it takes longer to
  get approval for a home than it does to build one,” the government said in a
  statement. The government said it would work with states and territories to
  pause further changes to the National Construction Code. It would then consult
  on ways to streamline the code, including the use of artificial intelligence
  to help tradies, small business and households in using the three-volume,
  2000-page code. A new “strike team” would be established within the
  environment department to accelerate the assessment of housing, with plans to
  use AI to “simplify and speed-up assessments and approvals”. “It’s too hard to
  build a home in this country. We want builders on site, not filling in forms
  to get their approval,” the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, said. “In the
  middle of a housing crisis a generation in the making, we want builders
  building good quality homes of the future – not figuring out how to
  incorporate another set of rules.” The environment minister, Murray Watt, said
  the measures would deliver faster decisions, unlocking new homes more quickly.
  “Fast-tracked projects will continue to be required to meet all environmental
  requirements,” he said. The federal government said it would also progress
  other housing reform ideas, such as removing barriers to superannuation
  investment and increasing the uptake of modern construction methods like
  prefab housing. The Property Council of Australia, which has advocated for
  faster environmental approvals and the adoption of AI in planning, welcomed
  the announcement. Chief executive Mike Zorbas described the announcements as
  “sensible” and a “win” for housing supply. “Let’s also put AI to work
  turbocharging housing delivery. A smart rollout of AI into planning and
  assessment systems will give decision-makers the clarity they need and save
  valuable time in delivering new homes,” he said. Speaking this week on the
  sidelines of the roundtable, Daniel Mookhey, the New South Wales treasurer,
  supported a pause in adding new federal regulations to the national
  construction code, saying it would “certainly” lead to more homes being built.
  “If the national code is frozen it gives us a bit more time to get the
  interactions between national standards and state standards clear,” he said,
  speaking this week. “But equally, it will give a lot of confidence to people
  who are looking to build right now.” But former industry minister Ed Husic
  said this week he was concerned about a pause to the code. Husic said the
  former Coalition government had frozen new homebuilding regulations, only to
  rush through a mass of changes in a short period of time. “People who’ve lived
  in older homes with regulations that weren’t as strong understand why
  livability is such an issue.” On Tuesday, Australian Conservation Foundation
  chief executive, Kelly O’Shannassy, called for environmental law reform –
  including national environment standards, an independent national EPA and
  better coordination between governments – as she headed into one of the
  roundtable sessions. “Faster decisions are crucial, as is stronger nature
  protection. Australia’s failed national nature law facilitates neither,” she
  said. “The national nature law contains a series of convoluted processes with
  no defined outcomes or transparent institutions – a recipe for slow,
  unpredictable decisions and ecological and economic decline.”
