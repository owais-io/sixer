  A new generation of film lovers is helping to drive an increase in cinema
  attendance across the UK. As the industry slowly recovers from the decline of
  audiences during the pandemic – there were 126.5m admissions in 2024 compared
  with 176.1m in 2019, the rise in younger people returning to cinema may be due
  to a newfound love for film developed during the lockdown years. Although
  figures are yet to be restored to pre-pandemic levels, admission rates are
  continuing to increase, and it is younger audiences in particular who are
  showing significant enthusiasm, with figures from the Cinema Advertising
  Association suggesting that under-35s make up 50% of cinemagoers across the
  board. This is a proportion, which includes all cinemas including mainstream
  multiplexes, has held steady over the last few years but the effect appears
  particularly marked on the independent cinema circuit. Curzon, which operates
  16 venues across the UK, reports there has been a clear shift over the past
  six years in young people overtaking older audiences. In 2019, the biggest age
  demographic of Curzon attendees was 65+, followed by 55-64. In 2025, however,
  the dominant age group is 25-34 – rising from 16% in 2019 to 31% in 2025 –
  followed by 18-25 (growing from 17% to 24% over the same period). The same
  goes for Bristol independent venue the Watershed, where the percentage of
  tickets sold to under 25s went from 19% (at reopening after lockdown in 2021)
  to 27% in 2024. (For comparison, the share of tickets sold to over 60s also
  increased, but by only by a single percentage point.) Steph Read, programmer
  at Watershed, says: “We find young people are quite adventurous with their
  taste, especially when it comes to older films and rereleases.” This year,
  Chungking Express from 1994 and 2004’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
  did well with younger audiences. “Over 50% of the audiences for both of those
  films were 24 and under,” Read says. Paul Gallagher, programme manager at
  Glasgow Film Theatre, attributes this new generation of filmgoers to “a
  growing appetite for cinema in general” that took off during lockdown.
  “Streaming became such a lifeline for lots of people, and there was definitely
  a younger audience who discovered the depth of the history of cinema at that
  moment.” “Gradually, in the years since then, this younger audience is now
  starting to join the dots and see that there are cinemas around that play
  stuff from the history of cinema. It’s not just new films, but that whole rich
  history of cinema.” Social media has clearly played its part. Gallagher says
  that screenings of films such as 1995 French social message thriller La Haine,
  as well as the works of directors such as Céline Sciamma and Wong Kar-Wai,
  have garnered much interest for their visual style and Instagram-friendly
  aesthetic. “We showed a couple of screenings of La Haine, and it was hugely
  popular, it sold out both of our biggest screens, which have just under 400
  seats, and there was a visibly younger audiences.” Film-dedicated apps such as
  Letterboxd have opened up access to a rich history of cinema, once the
  preserve of older film buffs, to a younger generation. “We’re Letterboxd
  fiends. That’s the first thing I do after a movie, I go to Letterboxd,” says
  Isiah Robinson, 22. Micha, 20, prefers to watch reruns of older films. “I
  don’t really go to the cinema to watch blockbusters, I want to watch films
  that already interest me,” she says. “The independent cinemas are usually
  cheaper anyways.” The cost of going to the cinema is another thing that young
  people factor in when deciding whether to see a film on the big screen. “We’re
  balancing the cost of living as well, so it’s a bit of a luxury,” says Isaiah
  Robinson, 22. According to the UK Cinema Association, the average price of a
  cinema ticket in the UK is £7.73, only a slight increase on 2018, when the
  average price was £7.22. Adjusted for inflation, the price is actually cheaper
  today than it was seven years ago. Adele Agwu-kalu, 20, isn’t dissuaded by the
  cost as she says it is similar to what she would spend going out for a drink.
  “A ticket is basically the same price as a drink,” she says. “So the price is
  not really a factor.” For other younger people, the cost is worth it as the
  big screen provides a “no-distractions zone”, as opposed to the experience
  watching a film at home. “It’s nice to switch off,” says Sophia Crothall, 23.
  “I don’t touch my phone the whole time I’m in the cinema. At home I’m probably
  scrolling.” Greg Walker, cinema manager and programmer at Manchester’s
  Cultplex suggests that “cinema etiquette” is one of the reasons that smaller
  venues in particular benefiting from the rise in younger people going to see
  films. “More often than not, independent cinema audiences are the ones who are
  more respectful. They’re not on the phones constantly, they’re not talking.”
  “A lot of young people get pigeonholed into being those kind of people at
  cinemas, but I think a lot of them are actually the ones who want to go and
  watch the film. It’s not just a social area.” However, Ben Luxford, director
  of UK audiences at the British Film Institute, says that this new wave of film
  fanaticism is “still quite a small pocket of people ultimately”. “It might be
  fuelling a change in the audience at places like the BFI Southbank or in
  cinemas in university towns across the country, but it’s not happening
  everywhere,” he says. Cinemas are also benefiting from the rising popularity
  of music films by big-name artists whose fanbase is typically younger. Taylor
  Swift: The Eras Tour, which was released in 2023, has become the
  highest-grossing concert film of all time. “Taylor Swift was a gamechanger,”
  says Eduardo Leal, group director of screen content at Vue. “The Eras Tour
  completely reset the ceiling for what a music film can do theatrically. Since
  then, we’ve had a bunch of successful K-pop titles such as J-Hope: In the Box
  and Seventeen: Power of Love.” “Social media has played a really big role in
  driving younger audiences to the cinema,” says Susie Bould, director of
  marketing at Curzon. “Films just spark and go viral. Saltburn, a few years
  ago, had a huge social virality, which gave it a life that it might not
  otherwise have had. I think people want to be part of the conversation.”
