  sets sights on World Cup

  A few years ago, Cass Bargell gave a Ted Talk at Harvard, the same university
  where she studied integrative biology and played scrum-half, helping the
  Crimson to a national 15s title and earning nominations for US player of the
  year. Onstage, visibly nervous, she clutched a rugby ball as if for emotional
  support. “I dropped the ball,” she says, laughing. “They edited it out.”
  Bargell didn’t drop the ball with her talk, which offered a compelling account
  of her traumatic experience with ulcerative colitis and her extraordinary
  recovery. It all began in late 2020, with alarming symptoms. Bargell kept
  playing through quickening pain but eventually, in November 2021, underwent
  ileostomy surgery to remove her colon and create a stoma, an opening in her
  abdomen to allow waste to pass. Just a few months later Bargell was back
  playing rugby, the sport she found as a middle-schooler in Summit, Colorado,
  as aggressive as ever but now wearing an ostomy bag. The title of her Ted Talk
  sums up her determination and her emergence as an advocate for life after
  surgery: No Colon, Still Rollin’. She has told her remarkable tale many times,
  including to former NFL Man of the Year and fellow patient Rolf Benirschke,
  for The Phoenix, official magazine of the United Ostomy Associations of
  America. But now, at 25 and eight times capped, Bargell is about to step onto
  the biggest stage of all – the 2025 Women’s Rugby World Cup in England, where
  the US kick-off against the hosts on Friday. Speaking to the Guardian, she
  said that though life with an ostomy had not “gotten any easier … I think I’ve
  gotten a lot better at handling it. “I think some things have actually gotten
  harder, in some ways. The longer I’ve had it, the more it feels like this
  daunting thing that’s gonna go on for ever. And I think I have, like, those
  big emotional moments, but I’m a lot better at handling it day to day. I don’t
  think about my bag and I know how to change it much faster now. I know how to
  handle my supplies.” Bargell’s play gives no clues of her extra burden. In
  Washington in July against Fiji, as the Americans struggled to hold a
  narrowing lead, the 5ft 4in dynamo forced two crucial turnovers, stealing
  Fijiana ball at the ruck. Turning to the nearest reporter to ask “Who’s that
  flanker the Eagles brought on?”, the Guardian was swiftly enlightened: not
  only was Bargell not a forward, but also, “that’s nothing: she plays with an
  ostomy bag.” Asked if that played on her mind during games, she said: “No, I
  don’t think about it. But I’m really lucky that I’m supported by my coaches
  too. “When I’m playing and I get hit in the bag, I don’t feel anything, I
  don’t think anything. I just put the ball back strongly. But if we’re in
  training and we’re doing a drill … where we come up and hit each other and
  then backpedal, reload, come up at each other again, backpedal, reload, just
  like working on the constant up and back, as the attacker I was just getting
  hit straight in the bag over and over and over, and I was like, this never
  happens to me in a game, and I’m really uncomfortable. “I wasn’t hurt from it
  or anything. I just was like, that’s wearing my bag down more than I need. And
  my coaches are like, perfect. ‘No problem. You’ll hold the pad next time.’ So
  then everyone was in the line and I just had a [tackle] pad, and it was fine.
  “So it’s not like I love getting hit in the bag repetitively. It’s just that
  when it happens, it’s not a big deal. I also feel like my right fend has
  gotten much stronger since I got my ostomy. I don’t like people getting that
  close, so when I can avoid it, I do.” She laughs again, and switches from
  hand-offs to helping hands, saluting the influence of Ilona Maher, the US
  center, Olympic sevens medalist and social media star who has fired global
  interest in the women’s game. “Ilona, the version you see on the internet is
  how she is,” Bargell says. “She’s, like, a fun, big personality. And also
  everything she says about there needs to be more stars [in women’s rugby] and
  we need to lift more women up, she lives that and walks it with us. She’s
  helped me so much with sharing my story, with all the social media stuff and
  everything she talks about in that world. “On the field, she’s fast and she’s
  powerful and she’s strong and she can pass, and she brings so much to our
  team. I love training with her. She’s also a really strong organizer, which I
  don’t think people can always see, but she does communicate a lot and helps us
  all.” Bargell, Maher and the rest of the Eagles may need all the help they can
  get on Friday: England are favorites to win the World Cup, having crushed
  rivals France in their final warm-up while the US lost to Canada, another
  title contender. Looking at that game, Bargell identified a failing familiar
  from the meeting with Fiji in DC: a strong start not maintained. “The first
  half felt easy,” says Bargell, who will start on the bench behind Olivia Ortiz
  on Friday. “It felt like that’s what we practiced in training, and it was just
  about executing it. “We’ve been working a lot on finding our energy right
  after half-time and being able to come out and start the second half the way
  we started the first half, because it really wasn’t like we weren’t surprising
  ourselves with what we were doing that first half. It was what we practiced.
  And so it’s just about finding a way to keep that energy throughout the whole
  game.” ‘We really rise’ Bargell is one of many Eagles who this year played in
  Women’s Elite Rugby, the semi-pro league which has just completed its first
  season, with Bargell turning out for the Boston Banshees while working as a
  data analyst for the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation. She speaks favorably of
  WER as a step up from the amateur game, if not at the level of Premiership
  Women’s Rugby, where senior Eagles including Ortiz play, where Maher shone for
  Bristol, and in which England’s Red Roses ply their fearsome trade. “I think
  an interesting part about our team is that we really rise,” Bargell says. “We
  rise to the occasion. And so I know we’ll rise [against England]. “It’s an
  incredible opportunity to be a part of that opening match at all, and I know
  everyone’s really excited for it. We’ve honestly just been focused on building
  our own systems. It’s not like these past three weeks were only focused on
  England.” True: Australia and Samoa also await, two wins most likely needed to
  make the quarter-finals. Australia offer the sterner test. In Perth in May,
  the Wallaroos downed the Eagles, 29-17. Bargell remains confident. “We all
  believe we have a lot of threats, and like who we are as players,” she says.
  “And so if we can bring our team together in that way, then we can compete.”
