  Seventh-generation farmer Brian Harbage grows corn, soybeans and grass, and
  runs a cattle operation across five counties in western Ohio. In the world of
  agriculture, his work makes up a large business. And still, the past two years
  have been immensely challenging amid the twin threats of the climate crisis
  and the Trump administration. Last year, regions of the eastern corn belt saw
  just 20% of crops harvested due to a drought that brought little precipitation
  between June and October. It was part of a climatic cycle that involved
  drought, heat and wildfires that cost crop producers $11bn nationally. “Last
  year, we got a good crop started, and then it just quit raining. Our yields
  were definitely reduced by at least 25-30%,” says Harbage. This year, it’s
  been almost the complete opposite. Excess rainfall has fueled severe disease
  and pest pressure on the several thousand acres of soybeans and corn he
  planted in the spring. “There were three-day windows, it seemed like. It would
  just start to get dried out and it would rain,” he says. “We finished up
  [planting] at the beginning of June. We like to be finished by 15 May.
  Anything that’s planted later means that it was probably planted in marginal
  conditions since we were rushing to get it in, and secondly, it doesn’t have
  near enough time to mature before harvest.” With the 2025 harvest of corn and
  soybeans approaching – America’s biggest two crops and the linchpins of
  agriculture – crop growers are facing down the gauntlet. Climatic swings,
  rocketing operating costs and low international demand, caused, in large part,
  by government policy in the shape of tariffs, has created the perfect storm.
  “Farming is not for the worrisome,” says Harbage. “We always kid that we are
  crisis managers.” Suicide rates among farmers are 3.5 times the national
  level. In 2023-24, China bought 24.9m metric tons of soybeans worth $13.2bn,
  largely used to feed its 427-million-strong pig herd. At under 6m metric tons,
  US farmers’ second biggest international soybean market, Mexico, lags far
  behind. Since 2017, when tariffs were first introduced by President Trump,
  crop farmers have been struggling with the decline of China as the leading
  market for soybeans and an important market for corn exports. Last month,
  reports emerged that exports of soybeans – America’s largest grain export by
  value – had hit a 20-year low. “Tariffs are probably something that will help
  in the long run, for the whole country; in the short run it’s terrible for
  farmers,” says Harbage. “We’re really taking it on the chin now because if we
  can’t export, our prices are low. And if we can’t export and we have a
  terrible crop then it’s a one-two punch. I see what the government wants to
  do, but it’s hurting me in the near term.” Farmers and rural Americans are
  keen to highlight that their political and voting preferences are rarely
  fueled by a single issue or event such as tariffs. Many continue to back
  Trump, despite the obvious financial challenges the president’s policies are
  fomenting. Trump has been largely silent on addressing the pain his tariffs
  have caused farmers and ranchers, despite rural voters being a cornerstone of
  his political base. On 10 August, he posted to Truth Social a demand that
  China quadruple its purchases of American soybeans. The president claimed that
  China was “worried” about having a soybean shortage, although China has vowed
  to increase its domestic soybean production yield by 38% by 2034. What’s more,
  some market analysts say that Trump’s post didn’t make the rounds on Chinese
  social media, suggesting his demand may not have been heard by the country’s
  political leaders. With the soybean harvest in the midwest set to start about
  a month from now, and corn following weeks later, the fear that China may not
  buy a single shipload of grain this season is growing for many. “With
  [tariffs] in place, we are not competitive with soybeans from Brazil. Our
  marketing year starts 1 October and usually by now we’d see China making
  commitments to pre-purchases for soybeans. China has not made a single
  purchase for US soybeans,” says Virginia Houston, director of government
  affairs at the American Soybean Association, a lobbying organization. “No
  market can match China’s demand for soybeans. Right now, there is a 20%
  retaliatory duty from China.” To appease his farming base, the Trump
  administration announced $60bn in subsidies for farmers over the next decade
  in the recent tax bill, but that has drawn criticism from those who say that
  farmers shouldn’t be subsidized on taxpayers’ dime. Others have reported that
  funding is going to select producers in specific regions of the US, benefiting
  bigger producers rather than family farms. Adding to the export challenges,
  the price of commodity crops in the US has been in steady decline for the past
  three years due to a smaller cattle herd and falling ethanol production.
  Houston says that when she speaks with the White House and Congress to share
  the struggles farmers are facing due to tariffs, the response is that “they
  support farmers [but] we are one cog in the wheel of this complex
  relationship. “The farm economy is in a much tougher place than where we were
  in 2018 [during Trump’s previous China trade war]. Prices have gone down while
  inputs – seed, fertilizer, chemicals, land and equipment – continue to go up.”
  All the while, unpredictable weather conditions continue to make planning more
  difficult. For much of this summer, afternoon storms had been a near-daily
  occurrence in Indiana, Ohio and elsewhere in the eastern corn belt, causing
  ponding that kills early plant growth. Diseases such as northern corn leaf
  blight, gray leaf spot and tar spot soon followed. “When it’s being attacked
  by disease, it’s not growing to its full potential because it’s trying to
  fight off the disease,” says Harbage. Although he treated his crops for
  disease, the heat and humidity that have been an uncommon feature of life this
  summer can overcome the effects of fungicides. On top of that, Harbage says
  he’ll have to spend additional money on propane to dry his corn before sending
  it to consumers, again due to the high moisture content. If Trump walked into
  his farm today, Harbage says he’d have one message. “The exports is number
  one. That’s the number one fix. We have to get rid of what we’re growing, or
  we have to be able to use it,” he says. “China, Mexico and Canada – we export
  $83bn worth of commodities to them a year. So if they’re not buying, we’re
  stuck with our crop.” In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide
