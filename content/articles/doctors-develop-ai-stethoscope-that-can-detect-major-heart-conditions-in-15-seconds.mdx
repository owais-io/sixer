  Doctors have successfully developed an artificial intelligence-led stethoscope
  that can detect three heart conditions in 15 seconds. Invented in 1816, the
  traditional stethoscope – used to listen to sounds within the body – has been
  a vital part of every medic’s toolkit for more than two centuries. Now a team
  have designed a hi-tech upgrade with AI capabilities that can diagnose heart
  failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms almost instantly. The
  new stethoscope developed by researchers at Imperial College London and
  Imperial College healthcare NHS trust can analyse tiny differences in
  heartbeat and blood flow undetectable to the human ear, and take a rapid ECG
  at the same time. Details of the breakthrough, which could boost early
  diagnosis of the three conditions, were presented to thousands of doctors at
  the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world’s
  largest heart conference. Early diagnosis is vital for heart failure, heart
  valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms, enabling those who need lifesaving
  medicines to be spotted sooner, before they become dangerously unwell. A study
  trialling the AI stethoscope, involving about 12,000 patients from 200 GP
  surgeries in the UK, looked at those with symptoms such as breathlessness or
  fatigue. Those examined using the new tool were twice as likely to be
  diagnosed with heart failure, compared with similar patients who were not
  examined using the technology. Patients were three times more likely to be
  diagnosed with atrial fibrillation – an abnormal heart rhythm that can
  increase the risk of having a stroke. They were almost twice as likely to be
  diagnosed with heart valve disease, which is where one or more heart valves do
  not work properly. Dr Patrik Bächtiger, of Imperial College London’s National
  Heart and Lung Institute and Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, said: “The
  design of the stethoscope has been unchanged for 200 years – until now. “So it
  is incredible that a smart stethoscope can be used for a 15-second
  examination, and then AI can quickly deliver a test result indicating whether
  someone has heart failure, atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease.” The
  device, manufactured by California company Eko Health, is about the size of a
  playing card. It is placed on a patient’s chest to take an ECG recording of
  the electrical signals from their heart, while its microphone records the
  sound of blood flowing through the heart. This information is sent to the
  cloud – a secure online data storage area – to be analysed by AI algorithms
  that can detect subtle heart problems a human would miss. The test result,
  indicating whether the patient should be flagged as at-risk for one of the
  three conditions or not, is sent back to a smartphone. The breakthrough does
  carry an element of risk, with a higher chance of people wrongly being told
  they may have one of the conditions when they do not. The researchers stressed
  the AI stethoscope should be used for patients with symptoms of suspected
  heart problems, and not for routine checks in healthy people. But it could
  also save lives and money by diagnosing people much earlier. Dr Mihir
  Kelshiker, also at Imperial College, said: “Most people with heart failure are
  only diagnosed when they arrive in A&amp;E seriously ill. “This trial shows
  that AI-enabled stethoscopes could change that – giving GPs a quick, simple
  tool to spot problems earlier, so patients can get the right treatment
  sooner.” Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, the clinical director of the British Heart
  Foundation, which part-funded the research alongside the National Institute
  for Health and Care Research (NIHR), said: “Given an earlier diagnosis, people
  can access the treatment they need to help them live well for longer.” Prof
  Mike Lewis, the NIHR scientific director for innovation, said: “This tool
  could be a real gamechanger for patients, bringing innovation directly into
  the hands of GPs. The AI stethoscope gives local clinicians the ability to
  spot problems earlier, diagnose patients in the community, and address some of
  the big killers in society.”
