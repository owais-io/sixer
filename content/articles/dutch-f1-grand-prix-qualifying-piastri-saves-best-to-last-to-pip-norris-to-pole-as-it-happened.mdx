  Here is Giles Richards qualifying report from Zandvoort is here and with that
  I’m going to sign off on today’s live blog. Dom Booth will have full coverage
  of the race tomorrow. Thanks for following along! It all flipped for the
  McLaren drivers in the final qualifying session. Piastri had trailed Norris in
  practice and the first two qualifying sessions, but came through in Q3. The
  Australian was feeling pretty happy with the timing of his best lap. Piastri
  said: “That was the definition of peaking at the right time, the whole weekend
  I felt pretty good but there have been a couple of corners that I’ve not been
  able to go any faster. “I didn’t really go any faster in those corners but I
  found some more elsewhere so I’m super happy to come away with the result.
  “Obviously we’ve still got all the points tomorrow but it was looking like a
  tricky weekend so far, so to come out with that I’m pretty stoked.” Norris,
  despite losing out to his teammate at the last didn’t seem too concerned: “It
  was close. It has been close all weekend so could easily go one way or the
  other. Yes I could be a little disappointed not on pole but not the end of the
  world either. “With the wind like this a lot of it is down to luck. I had a
  good lap. I am in a good position and we are in a good fight. “We will have
  some fun tomorrow. We both had terrible starts last year, we will see. It is a
  long race with a lot of laps.” Max Verstappen was pretty after taking P3. He
  told Sky post-qualifying: “This weekend so far was quite tricky for us but
  qualifying was basically the best I’ve felt all weekend and that’s exactly
  what you want. To get P3 here I’m very happy with that. “The energy of the
  crowd the whole weekend has been amazing, to see so much orange on the
  grandstand is always very special.” On the race: “Let’s see what we can do,
  the McLarens have been very fast all weekend so it’s also important to just
  focus on our own race and see what we can do. “This has been a good step
  forward so I hope we can keep that up going into the race tomorrow.” 1.
  Piastri (McLaren) 2. Norris (McLaren) 3. Verstappen (Red Bull) 4. Hadjar
  (Racing Bulls) 5. Russell (Mercedes) 6. Leclerc (Ferrari) 7. Hamilton
  (Ferrari) 8. Lawson (Racings Bulls) 9. Sainz (Williams) 10. Alonso (Aston
  Martin) 11. Antonelli (Mercedes) 12. Tsunoda (Red Bulls) 13. Bortoleto
  (Sauber) 14. Gasly (Alpine) 15. Albon (Williams) 16. Colapinto (Alpine) 17.
  Hulkenberg (Sauber) 18. Ocon (Haas) 19. Bearman (Haas) 20. Stroll (Aston
  Martin) Q3: Great drive Hadjar to take fourth ahead of Russell and Leclerc.
  Hamilton is seventh, followed by Lawson, Sainz and Alonso. Neither McLarens
  are able to improve their times on the final runs and that means Piastri will
  be P1. Verstappen really pushed it in his final to secure third place. Q3: The
  McLarens are out and we have around one minute to go. It’s nip and tuck
  between them Norris will come in first. Q3: Hadjar (7th), Alonso (8th), Sainz
  (9th) and Lawson (10th) make up the rest of the placings so far. Q3: Piastri’s
  time was just 0.012secs quicker Norris. Q3: Hamilton has gone quicker that
  Leclerc, Russell was third on the grid but Verstappen has just come through to
  better the Mercedes. Q3: Piastri posts a new track record to go fastest and
  sit provisionally on pole. Norris cannot go quicker. With one run to go Norris
  has to find some fractions of a second if he is to take pole. That is the
  first time all weekend that Piastri has bettered his teammate - that’s clutch.
  Piastri is out for his first run of the final qualifying session. Can he pip
  Norris to P1? Albon is raging on the radio about his tyres. His teammate Sainz
  made it into Q3 but there appears to have been mistakes made with the Thai
  driver’s vehicle in that session. Lawson and Alonso are the last cars to post
  times and both are significant as they eliminate the last two drivers on the
  bubble. Albon, Gasly, Bortoleto, Tsunoda and Antonelli all drop out. Q2: Albon
  out as he can’t post a quicker time than his first go around. Q2: Russell goes
  P6 and could be in trouble come the end of the session. Q2: Four minutes to
  go, most of the cars getting prepped for final runs. Currently in jeopardy are
  Gasly, Bortoleto, Sainz, Lawson and Albon. Q2: Good effort from the Ferraris,
  who are now fourth and ffith quickest overall. Hamilton ahead of Leclerc. Q2:
  Norris isn’t as quick in the Verstappen in the middle sector but he rips
  through the final third to post the fastest lap of all time at Zandvoort.
  Piastri is 0.090secs slower. Q2: Verstappen is going well through the first
  two sectors and posts a time half a secon quicker than his best in Q1. He’s
  now ahead of Antonelli, Tsunoda and Russell. Q2: Leclerc and Hamilton do look
  like they’re going to try to get three runs in. They are the only two cars to
  set a time so far. Leclerc quickest. Q2: Leclerc gets on the radio to report a
  fox on the track. Not the brightest move from the local wildlife. The Ferraris
  have darted out of the garage. Are they trying to get three goes at this? The
  bottom five is confirmed as Stroll, Bearman, Ocon, Hulkenberg and Colapinto.
  Sainz scrapes through and Liam Lawson has a storming final hot lap to go fifth
  quickest. Q1: Hamilton goes eigth fastest overall and Leclerc is one place
  back. They should make it through. Q1: Stroll is out of qualifying as we near
  the final two minutes of the session. Piastri has posted a new quickest time,
  making up time on the middle sector to go ahead of Norris. Q1: Hamilton will
  go again and so will Leclerc, who is in danger of elimination. Q1: Stroll is
  out of the car and looks unlikely to get back in it. Most of the cars are back
  in the pits ahead of their second hot laps. Q1: With little less than eight
  minutes to go, Stroll, Ocon, Tsunoda, Leclerc and Colapinto are in the
  elimination zone. Q1: Norris has gone three tenths of a second quicker than
  anyone else in his first run. Piastri has posted a time just 0.158secs slower
  than his teammate. Q1: Stroll’s Aston Martin may be recoverable to get him out
  again in the last 10 minutes of the session. if not we know who the backmarker
  will be. Q1: Verstappen has gone quicker than Hamilton with a 1min 09.754secs
  lap. Lance Stroll loses control going into turn 12 and spins into the
  barriers. It’s not a huge crash and we will continue. Q1: Ocon has been on the
  radio to remark about the strong winds across the track. Oliver Bearman sets
  the fastest time of the first batch of drivers out on the track. Leclerc
  cannot better it but Hamilton does. Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda is out on the
  track. The cars are strating to emerge from their garages. Q1 underway
  shortly. We’re about 15 minutes away from the start of Q1, what are you
  expecting from qualifying? Let me know via the link at the top of the page.

  1:11.054 Reports emerged this week of a potential superteam of F1 executives,
  Christian Horner, Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, combining forces to
  buy into Alpine. It was a report that got an approving nod from Mercedes team
  principal Toto Wolff but Briatore, who is running Alpine currently has poured
  cold water on those reports. The Italian told reporters at Zandvoort on
  Friday: “I’m not considering anything at this moment, and Christian is not in
  Formula 1 anymore. I hope he comes back soon but, for the moment, he’s not in
  the picture at Alpine.” I have emotions, I still feel everything that everyone
  else feels. It’s just that, being blunt, I think a lot of emotions are not
  that helpful. Oscar Piastri, the current drivers’ championship leader, spoke
  to Giles Richards ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix about how he is handling the
  pressure of trying to win a first world title. Lando Norris comes into
  qualifying at Zandvoort just nine points behind teammate Oscar Piastri in the
  drivers’ championship and hopeful of pole position after topping the standings
  in every practice session at the Dutch Grand Prix. Piastri was only marginally
  slower than Norris but their McLarens were significantly quicker than George
  Russell’s Mercedes in final practice. For comparison, there was a similar gap
  between the McLarens as from Russell to Esteban Ocon’s Haas in 18th. Norris
  said that this long stretch that now runs into the season’s climax will be
  “tricky”. He will need to cut out some of the errors that have cost him points
  so far during the campaign. When the margins are so tight between the two
  McLaren teammates, the destination of of the drivers’ championship will likely
  be decided by who makes the least mistakes. Norris accepts he has could have
  been in a better position at this stage but is not going to beat himself up
  about it. He said on Thursday: “Could I have at times made maybe better
  decisions? I think so. “I wouldn’t say I regret it. But do I wish I could do
  it better and do it again, yeah. But I don’t regret making those decisions at
  the time. That’s life. “Sometimes it goes your way and you get lucky and
  sometimes it goes the other way and you don’t make the best decisions but
  those are the times you learn the most.” Further down the grid, Carlos Sainz
  in the Williams had good pace in the final practice, as did Max Verstappen and
  Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc. Despite looking closely matched on Friday, Lewis
  Hamilton in the second Ferrari was 0.435secs behind his teammate. Hamilton
  appeared very downbeat after a poor showing in the last Grand Prix at the
  Hungaoring, but appears to have returned in a more positive mindset in the
  Netherlands, saying on Thursday that he is “focusing on my job that I love”.
  We are expecting a McLaren one-two at the front of the grid but the other
  places are very much up for grabs.
