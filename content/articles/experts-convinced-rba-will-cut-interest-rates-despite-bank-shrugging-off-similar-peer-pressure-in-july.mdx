  Australians are spending more but buying less than in 2022, underlining the
  intense cost-of-living pressures on households before Tuesday’s Reserve Bank
  of Australia interest rate decision. Economists and financial markets are once
  again convinced the RBA board will cut the official cash rate from 3.85% to
  3.6%, after the central bank stared down a similarly strong consensus and held
  rates steady at its previous meeting. Not all members of the rate-setting
  board were convinced of that decision at the time. Three of the nine voted in
  favour of a cut. The majority, however, did not see the need to rush rate cuts
  and wanted to see confirmation that inflation was tracking as expected through
  the three months to June. That confirmation duly came, with the latest
  quarterly consumer price report showing inflation sinking to as low as 2.1% –
  at the bottom of the bank’s 2% to 3% target range – while the RBA officials’
  preferred underlying measure of price growth also fell, to 2.7%. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Andrew Hauser, the deputy governor, has since described
  the inflation figures as “very welcome”. Given these developments, the chief
  economist of Deutsche Bank, Phil O’Donaghoe, said he expected the monetary
  policy board’s decision on Tuesday would be a unanimous vote in favour of a
  cut. If the RBA does cut rates for the third time this year, then homeowners
  with a variable mortgage should not be paying interest of more than 5.5%, said
  Sally Tindall, the data insights director at Canstar, an online comparison
  site. “In fact, if the majority of banks pass the cut on in full, which they
  should absolutely do, then there should be over 30 lenders offering at least
  one variable rate under 5.25%, while CBA and Westpac’s lowest rates could hit
  5.34%,” Tindall said. Total household consumption is 22% higher than three
  years earlier, based on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. But prices
  have climbed by roughly the same amount over that period, even as the
  population has swelled, and both have added to the total dollars being spent
  in the economy. After adjusting for inflation and putting it in per person
  terms, Australians, on average, are now buying 5% less than they were in early
  2022, according to Challenger’s chief economist, Jonathan Kearns. “No wonder
  the government is thinking about how to boost economic growth with its
  productivity summit in a couple of weeks,” Kearns said. There are worries the
  pandemic has left many households keener to save than spend, although data for
  the month of June showed shoppers were happy to take advantage of
  end-of-financial-year bargains.
