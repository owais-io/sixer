  TIN POT HALF FULL? These are bittersweet days at Selhurst Park. Win a first
  major trophy? Yay! Get demoted from Bigger Vase to Tin Pot? Eeeek. Away day to
  Lausanne for an appeal to overturn the decision? Believe. Beat the league
  champions at Wembley? Life is beautiful and the sunshine will never leave us.
  Lose the appeal the very next day? Life is a cruel, unrelenting beast and we
  reside on a dying planet marching towards extinction. Now comes the news of
  Eberechi Eze’s departure to Arsenal, brutal even if an exit was expected,
  another example of the big boys nabbing from the Premier League’s middle
  class. Nonetheless, their Tin Pot playoff first leg brings a fresh chapter as
  Palace launch into their first proper European campaign. Alas, we can’t really
  pay too much attention to their participation in the 1998 Intertoto Cup – gone
  but never forgotten – taking place after they’d been relegated from the
  Premier League and resulting in a 4-0 defeat across two legs by Turkish side
  Samsunspor. A more successful run surely awaits this time. The example of
  Chelsea winning Tin Pot is a bit pointless, their presence undermining the
  tournament’s appeal, but West Ham’s 2023 triumph is the template to follow, a
  club not lavished with silverware relishing their night of history. Oliver
  Glasner knows how to navigate the continent, having tasted Bigger Vase glory
  at Eintracht Frankfurt. He’s also moved past the multiple stages of grief
  after Palace’s drop to Europe’s third tier. “This is the last time I will
  respond to this question. We – the club, the fans, the players – deserve to
  play [Bigger Vase] because we are the FA Cup champions … but it was decided
  that we would get demoted,” harrumphed the Palace manager. “It’s still the
  first time European football is played at Selhurst*. This is the reward for
  winning the FA Cup and it’s European football, and we will enjoy it together
  with our fans.” Fredrikstad, cup winners in Norway, are Palace’s opponents in
  this playoff tie. They’re presumably not in London to take part in a
  testimonial for Eze. But this will be a night for farewells should the
  27-year-old still feature, a chance to witness him close out a memorable
  five-year spell that peaked with an immortal moment three months ago in the FA
  Cup final. For Palace, interrail pass to go with the bursting rucksack, it
  could well be the start of an exciting adventure. *Oliver, put a little bit of
  respect on the Intertoto QUOTE OF THE DAY What happened was extremely serious
  and extremely violent, something I’ve never encountered before. We had to take
  a decision because what happened went way beyond what is acceptable in a
  football club, as it would be in any organisation” – new season, same old
  combustible Marseille as chief suit chief Pablo Longoria confirms the England
  U21 player Jonathan Rowe and France midfielder Adrien Rabiot have both been
  transfer-listed following a furious bust-up after losing to Rennes.  FOOTBALL
  DAILY LETTERS Fair play to Spurs. Always being criticised for being ‘Spursy’,
  they’re now taking Spursiness to a new level. Just when it seemed a deal for
  Eberechi Eze was in the bag, their north London neighbours enticed him to pop
  next door for tea, contract talks, and exceedingly good cakes. Why be Spursy
  on the pitch alone when you can dare to be Spursy off the field too? Audere
  est facere indeed” – Mark McFadden. Spurs have just realised that there are no
  Eze deals in football” – Krishna Moorthy. It was only when I saw the new OGC
  Nice third shirt yesterday that I noticed that their new sponsor is Robinhood,
  which ironically tends to prefer preventing money going from the rich to the
  poor (and yet another defeat for nominative determinism by the way). But,
  surely they’re missing a trick by not sponsoring Nottingham Forest instead? Or
  would that just be too obvious?” – Noble Francis. If you have any, please send
  letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’
  the day is … Noble Francis. Terms and conditions for our competitions, when we
  run them, can be viewed here.  RECOMMENDED LISTENING Join Max Rushden, Barry
  Glendenning and the Football Weekly Extra pod squad as they discuss that
  Arsenal swoop for Eberechi Eze and more.  RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11
  September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites
  Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered
  football punditry at Troxy in London. The pod will also be livestreamed
  globally. Book now.  This is an extract from our daily football email …
