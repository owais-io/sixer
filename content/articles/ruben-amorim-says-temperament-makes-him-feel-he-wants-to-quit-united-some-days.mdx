  Ruben Amorim admitted his temperament makes him feel some days that he “wants
  to quit” and others that he would like to be Manchester United’s head coach
  for 20 years, as he said he would continue to give emotional post-match
  interviews. Amorim said after United’s Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby on
  Wednesday that “something has to change” and that “my players spoke really
  loud about what they want”, causing uncertainty about his future. Asked about
  this on Friday, he was defiant. “Guys, to be really honest, every time that we
  have in the future one defeat like that, I’m going to be like that,” Amorim
  said. “I’m going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my
  players, sometimes I want to defend my players. “This is my way of doing
  things and I’m going to be like that. In that moment I was so frustrated and
  annoyed. And I know you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way
  I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm: I’m not
  going to be like that.” Amorim was asked whether it is understandable that his
  post-Grimsby reaction caused uncertainty regarding whether he will resign. “If
  you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand
  that you have things that are good [from] that type of behaviour, that you
  have the other side of the coin. So I understand that. “And again, sometimes I
  want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years. Sometimes I love to be
  with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them. So, again, I need to
  improve on that. It’s going to be hard.” As the Guardian reported this week,
  Kobbie Mainoo wishes to leave. But Amorim said he valued the midfielder. “I
  want Kobbie to stay,” he said. “He needs to fight for his place, and we need
  Kobbie. So that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are
  not playing at this moment are disappointed. You have to fight during the week
  [in training].” United have accepted a bid for Antony from Real Betis for an
  undisclosed fee. The Brazilian signed on 1 September 2022 for £82m, the club’s
  second most expensive footballer. The fee Betis pay will represent a huge loss
  for United.
