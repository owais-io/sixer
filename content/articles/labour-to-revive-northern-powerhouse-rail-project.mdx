  Keir Starmer is to formally revive Northern Powerhouse Rail this autumn with
  an announcement expected before the Labour conference, as a major
  demonstration of Labour’s commitment to northern infrastructure. Sources said
  the speech would be delivered by Starmer and Rachel Reeves as they attempt to
  show their commitment to Labour’s former heartlands across the north of
  England, where Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is eyeing significant gains at the
  next general election. Government advisers are planning to time the
  announcement before Labour conference on 28 September, with the aim of
  boosting the morale of backbenchers after a series of damaging U-turns. The
  transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, is expected to make the rail project a
  key theme of her conference speech. A government source said the announcement
  was likely to take place before then but that the timing was not yet
  confirmed. Political and industry figures in the north of England have urged
  Starmer for over a year to revive the Manchester leg of HS2 and to build
  Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), an east-west connection linking Liverpool to
  Hull. NPR is seen by some as critical to rebalancing the UK’s economy as it
  would connect potentially five of Britain’s major cities – including Leeds,
  Bradford and Sheffield – on a route that for decades has been choked by
  trundling old trains and the overloaded M62. A DfT source said the exact route
  had not yet been formally agreed. The NPR plan requires part of the HS2
  construction between Crewe and Manchester to go ahead, raising hopes that
  ministers would also commit to some form of HS2 running to Birmingham and
  London. Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, has lobbied Starmer’s
  government extensively for both new rail networks. He has also warned,
  however, that any HS2 service that was high speed to the Midlands and a slower
  service in the north would be a “monument to the British mentality”. Hopes
  about imminent rail plans were raised last month when Heidi Alexander, the
  transport secretary, left open the possibility of reprising a form of HS2 to
  Manchester, a route killed off by Rishi Sunak in October 2023. The government
  spent more than £500m buying up land and property north of Birmingham under
  the original plans of HS2 travelling north along two legs, one to Leeds and
  the other to Manchester. Alexander confirmed last month that the land for the
  Leeds leg would now be formally sold off after that part of the project was
  axed by Boris Johnson in 2021. However, she left open the prospect of a new
  rail project on the Birmingham to Manchester land, which is still owned by the
  government. Reeves said in June that she would “take forward our ambitions”
  for NPR in the coming weeks and it appears on the infrastructure pipeline
  quietly published by the Treasury last month. While NPR has effectively been
  costed by the Treasury, the huge sums involved in funding a northern HS2 mean
  that it would almost certainly only be viable through a form of private
  investment. Starmer and Reeves began a series of meetings earlier this month
  to prepare the budget, likely to take place in mid-to-late November. They will
  begin to prepare the ground for tax rises and reforms from next month.
  Government strategists believe that the budget should be a moment to argue
  that Britain must now make serious choices on growth and productivity. They
  say Starmer must forcefully rebut the charges that the poor state of the
  economy is down to individual tax and spend choices, saying it is instead a
  sign of the weakness of the economy’s fundamentals.
