  In Las Vegas, 30 years ago, prisoner 922335, not long released from the
  Indiana Youth Center, boxed an unknown club fighter in a bout that shattered
  pay-per-view records. Mike Tyson v Peter McNeeley may be, in a competitive
  field, the most audaciously staged mismatch in boxing history. Its global
  success, despite only 89 seconds of action and a farcical ending, set the tone
  for the sport’s development in the modern era. Promoted simply as “He’s Back”,
  the contest was Tyson’s return after a three-year imprisonment for rape, but
  the former undisputed heavyweight champion’s popularity seemed to have
  increased. Among those ringside at a sold-out MGM Grand sat Madonna, Nicolas
  Cage, Jerry Seinfeld, Denzel Washington, Jim Carrey, Pamela Anderson, Eddie
  Murphy and an alarmingly human-coloured Donald Trump. All in attendance to see
  something akin to a ritual sacrifice. “Tyson brought out a crowd unlike
  anything I’ve ever known,” says the sportscaster Jim Gray, who covered the
  fight for Showtime. “Mike would even say: it goes from billionaires to the
  pimps and the drug dealers, to the chairman of the board and the highest
  celebrity. Mike was very proud he attracted everybody – and everybody did come
  out that night. We haven’t seen anything like it since.” McNeeley, the chosen
  fall guy to help Iron Mike shake off his ring rust, certainly enlivened the
  buildup. “I am going to wrap Mike Tyson in a cocoon of horror,” he said,
  during a barrage of pre-fight bluster that included poetry, bold predictions
  and lame gags. But it was his brooding opponent who was expected to provide
  the punchline. “McNeeley was being billed as an up-and-coming fighter with a
  36-1 record, most of his wins by knockout,” says Steve Albert, the commentator
  who called the fight in the US. “But when you looked at his list of opponents,
  you just shook your head.” Even considering the 29-year-old Tyson’s long
  layoff, the gulf in class pointed to dangerous matchmaking. “You’re not going
  to put Tyson in there with a top-notch contender in his first fight back, but
  this wasn’t a Rocky movie – it was a sanctioned fight,” says Albert. “It had
  the feel of an exhibition match, which was a disservice to the fans in the
  arena, the TV viewers and the media, including us, the ringside announcers.
  “Tyson-McNeeley was not only a way to reintroduce Tyson: it was about money
  and TV ratings. And it was also about seeing Tyson knock somebody – anybody –
  out.” Fans did not even get to see that. After an in-ring stare down, the
  underdog kept to his pre-fight promise and rushed at Tyson, swinging bar-room
  haymakers. He soon found himself on the canvas, but instantly got up and
  started jogging around the ring. “He went down, but then he jumped right up
  like a jack-in-a-box,” Tyson later recalled. “This guy was skipping around the
  ring and charging back at me. I couldn’t believe this shit.” After a few
  clumsy exchanges, McNeeley was felled, this time more seriously. “It was a
  double left hook, followed by a vicious right uppercut,” says Albert. “It was
  vintage Tyson. McNeeley was badly hurt, but he got up … and then came the
  chaos and confusion.” The abrupt ending involved McNeeley’s cornermen piling
  into the ring, despite their charge being gamely ready to go on, causing a
  disqualification. The messy finish provoked howls of derision from the crowd.
  The Nevada commission withheld the purse of the defeated fighter’s manager,
  Vinnie Vecchione, pending an investigation. “It was the easiest $25m Tyson
  ever made,” says Albert. “McNeeley’s corner probably did their guy a favour.
  But after the fight there was speculation that somebody in his camp had made a
  million-dollar bet that the fight wouldn’t last 90 seconds – the official time
  was 89 seconds of the first round. It just became another bizarre tale in
  boxing folklore.” The event’s promoter, Don King, somehow kept a straight face
  when claiming: “This night has been something we can all be proud of.” It was
  certainly a financial hit, earning a then record $96m in TV income, with 1.52m
  homes ordering it in the US. “True worldwide phenomenons have an appeal that
  it doesn’t matter what they’re doing,” says Gray. “Mike still has that appeal.
  Look at that Jake Paul fight. Tyson is an A-lister, but he has the appeal of
  everyman; trials and tribulations, redemption … back then, it was him coming
  out of jail. But everybody loves to see a hurricane. They didn’t know what to
  expect.” McNeeley cashed in on his notoriety with adverts for AOL and Pizza
  Hut, in which he was knocked out by a slice of stuffed crust. Tyson’s comeback
  continued as a money-making machine but – despite winning two versions of the
  world title – he never recovered the aura of invincibility shattered by his
  1990 defeat by Buster Douglas and his career ended with a series of limp
  losses. If the victory against McNeeley was ultimately unsuccessful in
  launching a second great act in Tyson’s career, it proved something more
  instructive: that people will pay to see a spectacle above a competitive
  contest. It paved the way for Floyd Mayweather Jr v Conor McGregor, Tyson v
  Paul, YouTube boxers and the modern trend of social media influencers
  profiting by throwing themselves into the arena. For Tyson, it showed that
  despite the defeats, the crimes, the personal turmoil, his grip on the public
  remained as strong as when he burst on to the scene in the 1980s. “I love
  Tyson, I’ve loved him for ever, because he’s the most honest athlete I’ve ever
  dealt with,” says Gray. “He knows he has his flaws. He’ll take his medicine
  when he’s wrong, he doesn’t try to blame others, and he’s trying to be better
  tomorrow than he was yesterday.” In the yesteryear of 1995, Tyson tested his
  drawing power in boxing’s greatest nonevent and he discovered that while he
  may be fallible as a fighter, his ongoing mystique remained bulletproof. Steve
  Albert’s book A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Broadcast Booth is out
  now; Jim Gray hosts the podcast Let’s Go! and wrote Talking to GOATs.
