  Britain’s economy has defied the doomsayers. After growing strongly in the
  first quarter this year, it expanded again in the three months to June – and
  not by the measly 0.1% forecast by City economists, but a respectable 0.3%.
  The latest data shows a 0.4% expansion in June alone as manufacturing
  recovered its mojo. Meanwhile, the construction sector, hit by a slowdown in
  new projects, turned its hand to repairs and maintenance, reversing a fall in
  May to post a solid 1.2% growth rate over the second quarter. Probably the
  most cheering aspect for Rachel Reeves from the latest Office for National
  Statistics data was the feedback from businesses involved in scientific
  research and development. This sector posted an 8.3% rise in activity in June
  alone, closely followed by the architectural and engineering sectors, which
  collectively expanded by 6.7% on the previous month. The chancellor is keen
  for everyone to forget about the missteps of the past year when one
  miscalculation after another has set off fireworks either inside the Labour
  party or the business community, or both. Donald Trump’s tariff wars played a
  part in dampening business activity, but it was the £25bn tax hit on
  employers, from increases to national insurance contributions for workers,
  that really hurt the private sector. While many small and medium-sized
  businesses are still struggling with the hangover from the NICs rise in April,
  the figures tell us that across industry and commerce, a bounceback is under
  way. Reeves still has major difficulties to confront. The slowdown from
  quarter to quarter will dent tax receipts at a time when the costs of running
  the government are increasing. Next week’s public finances data is expected to
  show that debt interest payments remain high and that the costs of servicing
  the UK’s borrowing will not fall as fast as hoped. Meanwhile, the clamour for
  more money for the defence department and cash-starved frontline public
  services only gets louder. There is likely to be a significant spending gap
  when the Office for Budget Responsibility makes its next assessment of the
  economy and the public finances before the autumn budget. It could be a £20bn
  shortfall, as many City economists expect, or it could be more than £40bn, as
  the National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank has
  estimated. Either way, it is going to be a big hole to fill, and manifesto
  commitments to exclude income tax, employee national insurance and VAT from
  any review will make the job very difficult. There is also cause for concern
  from the ONS figures that show much of the recovery depends on increased
  public spending. There is little sign that consumer confidence or business
  investment is on the road to recovery. Consumers are sitting on their hands,
  saving the gains they are making from average increases in wages above
  inflation. Meanwhile, a 3.9% rise in business investment in the first quarter
  was wiped out by a 4% fall in the second quarter. One business lobby group
  said there was “no doubt that private sector growth is being held back by both
  global and domestic policy uncertainty”, adding that speculation over
  forthcoming tax increases was adding to the headwinds. Reeves has emphasised
  that she wants to focus on clearing more barriers to growth and increasing
  productivity. Usually that is a slow process. The chancellor may need to be
  more explicit, sooner rather than later, about who will pay the taxes needed
  to make the budget numbers add up if she wants the economic momentum to carry
  through to 2026.
