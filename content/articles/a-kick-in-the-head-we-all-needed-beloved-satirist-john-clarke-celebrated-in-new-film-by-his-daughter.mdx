  In a career that spanned close to 40 years, the late satirist and comedian
  John Clarke played thousands of people. In his native New Zealand he was Fred
  Dagg, sheep farmer and gumboot philosopher. In Australia he was best known as
  one half of Clarke and Dawe – the voice of an endless parade of risible
  politicians, shonky businessmen and overconfident idiots. His magic trick was
  to play them all as himself. His eldest daughter, Lorin Clarke, explains it in
  her father’s own words. “He used to say to me, ‘If you ask some actors to play
  Hamlet, they will become a Danish prince, and they will research Danish
  princes. If you ask me to play Hamlet, Hamlet comes from Palmerston North.’”
  In Lorin’s new documentary about her father, But Also John Clarke, his old
  friend and fellow New Zealander Sam Neill puts it this way: “John was a
  polymath. He could write, he could perform, he could knock up a poem for you,
  but there was always that John Clarke thing in the middle of it.” Clarke died
  suddenly in 2017 aged 68, after suffering a heart attack on a bushwalk in the
  Grampians, Victoria. He had been birdwatching, a beloved pastime. The then
  Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said Clarke’s satire – of which
  he was a frequent target – “served a noble purpose. It spoke truth to power.
  It made our democracy richer and stronger.” Not all who felt the blade of
  Clarke’s wit were so generous. In the film the British comedian Ben Elton
  tells Lorin that “sometimes, when John skewered a target, they didn’t even
  know they were dead until the following day”. In the late 70s Clarke was all
  but run out of New Zealand, where Dagg had become a cultural phenomenon, and
  annoying gadfly. Originally, the film’s title was Not Only Fred Dagg But Also
  John Clarke. At the last minute, it was shortened, with a compromise: in New
  Zealand, it screens as Not Only Fred Dagg (after Clarke’s death, Dagg’s
  uniform of bucket hat, shearer’s singlet, shorts and gumboots went on display
  at Te Papa Museum in Wellington). Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown
  of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning
  The shortening of the title annoyed Lorin. “Don’t write that eye-roll into
  your piece!” she says laughing, immediately after rolling her eyes on our Zoom
  call. “I love the title, I think it’s funny and playful, and it’s a slight nod
  to Peter Cook and Dudley Moore’s Not Only … But Also. But, you know, shorter
  titles work better in things like listings and so on.” The majority of the
  film is given over to the stultifying forces that created Dagg. In this guise
  Clarke was, in the actor and director Oscar Kightley’s words, “the godfather
  of New Zealand comedy” – the dustbowl-dry, ultra-deadpan wit that runs through
  the films of Taika Waititi and the work of Flight of the Conchords. Rhys
  Darby, who played the Conchords’ hapless band manager, Murray, describes
  Dagg’s character as “a kick in the head with a gumboot we all kind of needed”.
  At the time of Dagg’s first appearance on NZBC in the early 70s (then New
  Zealand’s only television broadcaster, now known as TVNZ 1), broadcasters
  still spoke in perfectly rounded British accents. Dagg punctured such
  pretensions. His was a comedy of the familiar: for the first time, a New
  Zealander was holding up a mirror to the country. Clarke picked a national
  archetype – a sheep farmer – and turned him into a fool with seven sons, all
  named Trevor, but also a relatable, laconic everyman. A newspaper headline
  described him as the thinking man’s Paul Hogan. In a small country, Dagg’s
  success was overwhelming. Fred Dagg’s Greatest Hits, a novelty album made in
  four hours, is claimed to have been the biggest-selling debut by a New Zealand
  artist until it was topped by Lorde’s Pure Heroine. But Dagg also made enemies
  – as Neill notes, New Zealanders lop tall poppies even quicker than
  Australians. Clarke moved to Australia in 1977. By then a new father, he laid
  low – waiting, watching and listening. He was learning a new vernacular. The
  Dagg character was becoming a prison: “To him [moving to Australia] felt like
  a chance for reinvention,” Lorin says. For a few years Clarke avoided
  performing, concentrating on writing. He re-emerged on The Gillies Report,
  calling the fictitious sport of Farnarkeling, perhaps the most extreme
  showcase for Clarke’s love of language: the game was “engaged in by two teams
  whose purpose is to arkle, and to prevent the other team from arkeling, using
  a flukem to propel a gonad through sets of posts situated at random around the
  periphery of a grommet”. Sports-mad Melbourne, especially, went into a frenzy.
  Letters poured in to the Age. Somewhere, Roy and HG were taking notes. Wendy
  Harmer, who starred alongside Clarke on The Gillies Report, tells Lorin that
  by the early 80s, “he had us nailed”; by 1987 Clarke and (Bryan) Dawe made
  their debut on ABC Radio. It’s easiest to see Clarke’s influence, perhaps, on
  Working Dog productions: just as Dagg was a playful reflection of the New
  Zealand national character, The Castle poked gentle fun at Australia’s small
  suburban aspirations and law of the vibe. The TV series Utopia owes an obvious
  debt to the Olympic piss-take The Games, co-written with Ross Stevenson. The
  debut of The Games was one occasion when Clarke expressed his frustration with
  his masters at the ABC. Today such a program would be given less time to find
  its feet. Clarke – who always regarded his audience as far smarter than his
  bosses – wanted to give viewers space to pick up what he called the grammar of
  the show so they could become fluent in it. Ultimately, they came to love and
  trust Clarke because, no matter who he was playing, he somehow remained
  himself. Jana Wendt, who hosted Clarke and Dawe on A Current Affair from 1989
  to 1996, notes that it was all in Clarke’s eyes – that inimitable, mischievous
  look to camera that invited the audience in on the joke. “There was something
  watchful about him, even when he was pretending to be somebody else,” Lorin
  says. “There was a layer of awareness there, and he had really protective
  relationship with his audience. I wanted to honour that.” But Also John Clarke
  is screening across Victoria from 15 August as part of Melbourne international
  film festival
