  Thomas Frank described himself as “very, very proud” of a Tottenham team that
  came within two minutes of a famous Uefa Super Cup win over Paris
  Saint-Germain. They were ultimately defeated on penalties after squandering a
  two-goal lead and their new manager was left to rue an inability to bend the
  outcome to their will in the shootout. Goals from Micky van de Ven and
  Cristian Romero appeared to have rocket-launched Frank’s tenure before Lee
  Kang-in and Gonçalo Ramos curtailed the celebrations. But the Dane saw plenty
  of encouragement in the way his players dominated their star-studded opponents
  for the first three quarters of the match. “Very, very proud of the players,
  the team, the club, the fans,” he said. “I think the players gave everything
  against one of the best teams in the world, maybe the best. I think for 75 to
  80 minutes we were perfect, almost giving nothing away.” Tottenham were
  decisively undone when Van de Ven and Mathys Tel missed in the shootout but
  Frank was in no mood to apportion blame. “It’s down to the smallest of
  margins, like the flip of a coin,” he said. “I’d like to thank all the players
  who stepped up, were brave and took responsibility.” Frank had set Spurs up
  with a back three and placed a heavy emphasis on set pieces, which they
  practised in the warm-up and deployed effectively for both goals. It recalled
  some of his best work with Brentford but he said the tactics had been honed
  specifically to trouble PSG. “It was a special operation,” he said. “In
  medical terms the operation succeeded but the patient died, so not that good
  in the end. But we worked on a gameplan that was a little bit different and
  very close to succeeding.” There were signs of a greater flexibility than
  Spurs had tended to exhibit under Frank’s predecessor, Ange Postecoglou. “We
  showed that we can be adaptable and pragmatic, and we needed to be against a
  team like PSG,” he said. “The way we wanted to defend, high pressure and low
  defending, was top, almost perfect, and also the set pieces were very good and
  dangerous.” A Premier League opener with Burnley awaits on Saturday and, in
  the meantime, Spurs are attempting to sign the Manchester City forward Savinho
  and the Crystal Palace talisman Eberechi Eze. “We’d like to strengthen the
  squad, no doubt about that,” Frank said. “We do work very hard to see if we
  can do that. In general I am very happy with the squad but in any transfer
  window we try to see if we can make the squad stronger before the window
  closes.” The PSG manager Luis Enrique praised Lucas Chevalier, the debutant
  goalkeeper, who replaced the seemingly outbound Gianluigi Donnarumma.
  Chevalier should have done better for Romero’s goal but saved from Van de Ven
  in the shootout. “He’s shown personality and we want him to integrate with the
  team immediately,” he said. “Everyone was talking about the situation, his
  wasn’t easy, but he showed great character.”
