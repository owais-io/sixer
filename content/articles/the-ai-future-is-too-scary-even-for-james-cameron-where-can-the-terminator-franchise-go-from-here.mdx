  The AI future is too scary even for James Cameron. Where can the Terminator
  franchise go from here?

  James Cameron has a confession: he can’t write Terminator 7. And it’s not
  because Hollywood won’t let him, as he’s too busy making the new Avatar – it’s
  because reality keeps nicking his plotlines. “I’m at a point right now where I
  have a hard time writing science-fiction,” Cameron told CNN this week. “I’m
  tasked with writing a new Terminator story [but] I don’t know what to say that
  won’t be overtaken by real events. We are living in a science-fiction age
  right now.” It’s an understandable quandary for the veteran film-maker. Back
  in 1984, when the first Terminator movie came out, there was genuine shock
  value in the idea of a killer robot travelling through time from a future in
  which the wretched dregs of humanity survive in a chrome-plated hellscape
  dominated by their robot overlords. These days, the only far-fetched part of
  the movie is the bit where the T-800 turns up alone and completely naked, as
  opposed to arriving flanked by a swarm of AI-guided drones. We may not have
  achieved time travel just yet, but we do have artificial intelligences capable
  of quietly teaching themselves sarcasm, city-wide facial recognition, and
  robot learning systems deciding who lives and dies. That’s the heart of
  Cameron’s problem: in 1984, Skynet was a terrifying piece of speculative
  fiction. In 2025, it’s basically LinkedIn with nukes. The creeping dread of AI
  isn’t a future shock any more; it’s the news cycle. From AI-powered spyware in
  our pockets to deepfake scams and voice-mimicking chatbots, the Terminator
  franchise no longer has the monopoly on making you want to hurl your hi-tech
  personal possessions into the sea. Cameron seems to be caught between a rock
  and a hard place here, especially as this grand old sci-fi saga hasn’t exactly
  been blowing anyone’s CPU in well … decades. Terminator: Dark Fate, which the
  saga’s creator at least had a basic hand in developing, struggled at the 2019
  box office despite the return of Linda Hamilton and a storyline that tried to
  mix the franchise’s classic “unstoppable hunter” formula with a reunion tour
  for its surviving stars. Before that, we have to go all the way back to 1991’s
  Terminator 2: Judgment Day to find a film that audiences really warmed to. The
  wilderness years between those two movies were littered with sequels that were
  too bleak, or too daft. What Cameron should be looking for is a complete
  system reboot to reinvigorate the saga in the way Prey brought fans back to
  Predator and Alien: Romulus restored interest in slimy Xenomorphs. All
  evidence suggests that the 70-year-old film-maker is far more interested in
  the current challenges surrounding AI, superintelligences and humankind’s
  constant efforts to destroy itself, which doesn’t exactly lend itself to the
  sort of back-to-basics,
  relentless-monsters-hunt-a-few-unlucky-humans-for-two-hours approach that has
  worked elsewhere. The challenge here seems to be to fuse Terminator’s core DNA
  – unstoppable cyborgs, explosive chase sequences, and Sarah Connor-level
  defiance – with the occasionally rather more prosaic yet equally scary
  existential anxieties of 21st-century AI doom-mongering. So we may get
  Terminator 7: Kill List, in which a single, battered freedom fighter is hunted
  across a decimated city by a T-800 running a predictive policing algorithm
  that knows her next move before she does. Or T7: Singularity’s Mom, in which a
  lone Sarah Connor-type must protect a teenage coder whose chatbot will one day
  evolve into Skynet. Or Terminator 7: Terms and Conditions, in which humanity’s
  downfall comes not from nuclear warfare but from everyone absent-mindedly
  agreeing to Skynet’s new privacy policy, triggering an army of leather-clad
  enforcers to collect on the fine print. Or perhaps the future just looks
  terrifying enough without Cameron getting involved – which, rather worryingly
  for the future of the franchise, seems to be the director’s essential point.
  Then again, if anyone can make the apocalypse feel even worse than it already
  does, it’s the man who previously convinced us that autonomous drones would
  hunt humans from the sky and that machines would learn to think and kill for
  themselves. We should have confidence he can do it again.
