  In the end Marcus Rashford did get to make his competitive debut for Barcelona
  as they began their defence of the La Liga title. Formally registered a little
  after 10.30 on Saturday morning, Barcelona’s economic obstacles overcome, he
  was introduced just after 9pm with 22 minutes left of a sticky and ultimately
  successful night in Mallorca. By the time he pulled on his shirt and stepped
  up to the line, one of three subs brought on, the temperature had dropped a
  little, if still not enough, the game was already won, he was up against only
  nine men, and he got 10 touches. It wasn’t much, but it was a start. Earlier
  than expected, too: Rashford had insisted he was confident but the doubts over
  him being registered were not resolved until the morning of the match. And so,
  on 68 minutes, there he was waiting to come on. Playing through the middle
  with Barcelona already 2-0 up and drifting through a second half that Hansi
  Flick said he didn’t like at all, Rashford produced a couple of neat layoffs,
  a handful of passes and had two fleeting glimpses of goal. In one, he was a
  little slow to react, in the other the ball was caught under his feet as he
  tried to cut back inside. He did though get a closeup glimpse of another
  moment of magic from Lamine Yamal, who provided the final touch with that
  Lamine Yamal goal. That’s some teammate he has there. A video from training
  had done the rounds last week in which Lamine Yamal had responded to another
  bamboozled opponent by declaring: “I’m unstoppable,” and he didn’t waste time
  lending weight to that claim. His season was two minutes in, when he twisted,
  turned, stopped-started and escaped into the area, a warning to Johan Mojica
  and Mallorca – if they needed it – that this wasn’t going to be an easy
  evening. Five minutes later, he slipped the knife in, clipping in what
  appeared an easy, almost lazy ball to the far post. There, all alone and from
  close range, Raphinha headed Barcelona into the lead. There was a kind of
  stillness about the place, as if someone had pressed pause: it had been too
  simple, the space the Brazilian had too big for it to be real. But, while the
  referee did pause to check for offside, it was. Mallorca did react, Vedat
  Muriqi laying off inside the Barcelona area when he might have taken the shot
  himself. Mojica was making progress up the left in those moments when he was
  released from watching Lamine Yamal, his low deliveries the source of the most
  danger. There was an attempted overhead kick from Takuma Asano and an
  opportunity for Muriqi, which he struck straight at Joan García in Barça’s
  goal. And then Barcelona scored a second. Again, there was something strange
  about it – more so than the first time. Lamine Yamal had come inside and hit a
  shot that Antonio Raíllo had blocked with his head. The centre-back collapsed
  to the floor, his head in his hands, his face on the turf, and the ball looped
  up. When it came down again, Lamine Yamal just about controlled. Ferran Torres
  took the ball, stumbled past a couple of chances and smashed a superb shot
  into the top corner. Six seconds had passed, Raíllo was still down and, while
  no one had stopped exactly, or not physically, perhaps mentally they had, as
  if waiting for a whistle that never came. The shot flew past Raíllo who was
  still on the ground and Leo Román didn’t dive – although that might have been
  as much about the possibility of getting there anyway. Pedri slapped palms
  with Torres but there was a kind of shrug from the scorer, as if everyone
  assumed this wouldn’t count. It did. Mallorca were incensed, and soon their
  inferiority was irredeemable. Two goals down, they were quickly two men down.
  An outrageous turn and run from Lamine Yamal began on the halfway line and,
  beyond Mojica and Sergi Darder, ended on the edge of the Mallorca area, where
  Manu Morlanes clipped him. Morlanes was shown a second yellow. That was on
  half an hour; within nine minutes, another man walked. Muriqi was originally
  shown a yellow card for his challenge on García but, freeze-framed, it looked
  worse on the video assistant referee screen: a set of studs in the keeper’s
  face led to the yellow being upgraded to a red. This was done bar the shouting
  – and there was a lot of that, of course. Hands were up because this, the fans
  claimed, was a robbery. Lamine Yamal wanted his goal, twice sending shots just
  wide before the break and then bending one over at the start of the second
  half. Flick though was not happy with what he saw in that second half, and
  Lamine Yamal would have to wait until the final minute. There had been chances
  for others too, even if Mallorca resisted pretty well two men down. Raphinha
  shot wide, Dani Olmo hit a post, Ronald Araújo volleyed wide. Leo Román made a
  superb save from Olmo and another from Eric García. Rashford joined in but
  didn’t get the chance to test the keeper, a swift one-two with Pedri earning
  him a raised thumb but not a shot on goal. And then, as the clock went past
  90, when he was looking for space to shoot he appeared to tread on the ball,
  leaving time for just one more moment, and that belonged to Lamine Yamal.
