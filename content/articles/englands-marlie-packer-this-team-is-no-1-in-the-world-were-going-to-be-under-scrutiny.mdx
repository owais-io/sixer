  under scrutiny’

  “If you asked me at the start of pre-season: ‘Am I going to this World Cup?’
  No. I didn’t think I was going,” says the former England captain Marlie
  Packer. Self-doubt around her selection may surprise a lot of people. A World
  Cup winner in 2014, the 35-year-old will compete in her fourth successive
  global showpiece for the Red Roses after being duly confirmed in the 32-player
  squad for the host nation. But Packer has been through a lot in the past 12
  months. She was named world player of the year in 2023 and during the two
  seasons that she led England, the side won all 20 games. Then, in January, the
  openside flanker had the captaincy taken away, with the second-row Zoe
  Aldcroft given the armband. Packer was made a vice-captain for the 2025 Six
  Nations but was included in only two matchday squads. Defiance and
  determination have been hallmarks of her 111-cap international career. She has
  built a resilience and is keen to push the message that whatever is right for
  the team to put them in the best position to win the World Cup when it gets
  under way on 22 August is the decision she will always agree with. But she
  also describes decisions out of her control in 2025 as “tough”. When asked
  which hurt more, having the captaincy taken from her or being left out of
  matchday squads Packer lets out a little laugh, looks away out of the window
  and is a little emotional before saying: “That’s a question isn’t it?” She
  adds: “When me and Mitch [the coach John Mitchell] sat down and talked about
  the captaincy, I am an openside flanker and what he sees and wants from his
  flanker is to cover six and eight; I don’t cover six and eight in the role he
  wants it to be. “The game has changed and evolved, that is the way he wants to
  play. I knew if I wasn’t starting that I am more likely not to be in that
  matchday 23. He has told me that in black and white. I know where I stand and
  where I sit. “Anything can happen, injuries happen so I always have to make
  sure I am ready. But with that, all I can keep doing is when we do extras at
  the end of training sessions I am showing I am upskilling myself in those
  areas so if I ever was called upon I know I can do what is asked of me. That’s
  all I can do. “I’m not going to lie to you and sit here and say that being
  left out of the matchday 23 wasn’t hard but what happened is that even though
  I wasn’t in the matchday 23, I still travelled with the squad, I was still a
  massive part of it. I felt so much value in that.” Nonetheless, being left out
  for the France game at Twickenham – when England squeaked to a 43-42 victory
  to seal their grand slam in April – stung. “It’s always tough not to be
  selected for the France game,” Packer says. “Playing at Allianz Stadium is
  everything. Two years ago when I captained my country to a world-record crowd
  and my son was mascot, that is one moment I bottle up and it means everything.
  “But at the start of the game week [in 2025] Mitch says: ‘I want you in the
  coaching box with us.’ The value of learning what it’s like to be up there,
  what he is thinking, what he is seeing, the plans. You’re in the know, you’re
  trusted. That does mean a lot. “He’ll say it; it’s one man’s decision and it’s
  tough. But he genuinely cares and I know he does and I genuinely care about
  him and this squad as well.” Mitchell was full of praise for Packer at the
  World Cup squad announcement and it is clear she remains a key aspect of the
  Red Roses machine. She is also one of the most experienced in the squad with
  only Emily Scarratt – who is poised to feature in her fifth tournament –
  having played in more. But still doubt remained in her mind over her own
  selection. “Oh yeah,” Packer responds when asked if there were any worries
  around her selection. “100%, of course. Any athlete would tell you that in any
  sport. If you get comfortable being where you are then it’s going to get taken
  from underneath you. “You get swamped down with things but you have to keep
  pushing yourself to be the best of the best. We ain’t got time for people to
  be complacent in their role and in their job. We need to keep elevating each
  other and being the best of the best because that is the difference between
  winning and losing a World Cup. “I put myself in the best possible step to go
  to this World Cup. I came into pre-season, I felt fit, strong, and good. “I am
  actually really happy … with Mitch’s communication with me about where I am
  going, what his thinking was and what his decisions were looking like over the
  warm-up games and pool games. For me I know where I’m at, head down, keep
  going, keep working hard and keep elevating everyone around me.” The warm-ups
  have not gone completely to plan, though, with Packer being sent off against
  Spain on 2 August, risking a suspension that would rule her out of the
  tournament. A disciplinary panel, however, handed her only a one-game ban,
  putting her out of the warm-up against France, but leaving her free to play at
  the World Cup. This may be Packer’s fourth World Cup but it is her first at
  home, something she describes as the “icing on the cake” with the cherry
  coming if the team win the trophy. The tournament has already broken records,
  selling the most tickets of any Women’s Rugby World Cup with 350,000 sold so
  far. The final at Twickenham is expected to be sold out which would set a new
  milestone for the highest-attended women’s rugby game. The Red Roses have the
  opportunity to do something special by winning the trophy at home but they
  have fallen at the last hurdle in the previous two tournaments, losing both
  finals to New Zealand. The talk around that will inevitably grow the further
  England go in the competition but it is apparently not a focus in the Red
  Roses camp. Packer says: “That was three years ago and the one before that was
  eight years ago, there is no point living in the past. This is a whole new
  group of players. This is a whole new coaching staff apart from Deacs [the
  forwards coach Louis Deacon]. You have to be in the here and now. “The media
  can say and do whatever they want. Some players are going to read into it,
  some won’t but it’s what we know within. That’s all that matters. “We know we
  are going to be under scrutiny, we are the Red Roses. We have been a
  professional team for a lot longer than a lot of these other nations. We are
  the team that is ranked No 1 in the world with the highest-ever ranking that
  has ever been in rugby – not just women’s rugby. We are an outfit that can be
  scrutinised but what we know is we have got to keep living in the moment and
  enjoying it.” For Packer, past World Cups are chapters already written. Now,
  with doubts behind her and selection secured, her eyes are on the story
  England aim to write in this one.
