  The first game under the lights at Hill Dickinson Stadium was illuminated by
  Carlos Alcaraz’s fine finish and the promise of Harrison Armstrong. Everton’s
  cutting edge may remain a concern for David Moyes in the long term but a
  potentially awkward tie was eventually navigated in straightforward fashion.
  Alcaraz broke the deadlock against Nigel Clough’s resolute League One side
  with an excellent strike from 20 yards. Armstrong, who spent last season on
  loan at Derby, was the provider and also created Everton’s late second for
  Beto as Moyes’ team made it two wins from two at their new home. The combined
  appeal of a new ground and a sensible ticket pricing policy ensured the first
  cup tie at Hill Dickinson Stadium was a sell-out. Mansfield, also benefiting
  from reduced prices of £15 for adults, £10 for over-65s and £5 for under-18s,
  brought over 6,000 fans to the banks of the River Mersey to contribute towards
  Everton’s biggest home attendance for a League Cup tie since 1987.
  Unfortunately, many had problems gaining entry and kick-off was delayed for 15
  minutes to “ensure all supporters have safe access into Hill Dickinson
  Stadium” according to a statement released by Everton. The delay can be filed
  under teething troubles, but it had been predicted by Evertonians when
  highlighting numerous issues with the club’s new digital tickets on social
  media before the game. On top of complaints over how the Club View section of
  the East Stand operated against Brighton on Sunday, complaints that Everton
  have acknowledged, there is clearly work to be done on improving the
  match-going experience at Hill Dickinson Stadium. Despite a combined history
  of 275 years this was the first competitive meeting between these clubs. The
  noise from a raucous away section when the half-time whistle went confirmed
  who was the happier with a goalless first 45 minutes. Moyes selected a strong
  side for the tie with Jack Grealish again starting on the left. He also gave
  some required game-time to the fit-again Vitalii Mykolenko, who missed the
  first two Premier League games of the season with a groin injury, Dwight
  McNeil and Séamus Coleman, who received a rousing reception before kick-off.
  Everton were bright in patches, but only in patches. Mansfield goalkeeper Liam
  Roberts made an impressive early save from Carlos Alcaraz’s low drive and
  stopped another effort from Harrison Armstrong after the teenage midfielder
  had been released in space by Grealish. Otherwise, Everton struggled to break
  down a disciplined League One defence. McNeil sliced over when found unmarked
  inside the visiting penalty area by Grealish, having missed a similar
  invitation from the same player against Brighton, and the England
  international also skied a decent chance from James Garner’s pass. Mansfield
  looked increasingly comfortable as the first half wore on and began to take
  the game to their Premier League hosts. The break came at a bad time for Nigel
  Clough’s side. Everton re-emerged for the second half with greater intensity
  and a willingness to commit more bodies forward. Mansfield came under
  sustained pressure as a result, with Grealish forcing Roberts into another
  important save, before it finally told. Armstrong was the instigator as the
  18-year-old homegrown talent increased Moyes’ dilemma over whether to retain
  his services or loan them out this season. Collecting a lay-off from Thierno
  Barry, Armstrong showed neat footwork inside the area to keep possession under
  pressure before laying it back to Alcaraz. The Argentina midfielder picked his
  spot to perfection and swept an unstoppable finish beyond Roberts from 20
  yards. Everton’s new £40m signing Tyler Dibling was introduced for his debut
  on the hour with Grealish making way. Beto also came on as part of a double
  substitution and should have put the tie beyond Mansfield when a Michael Keane
  challenge broke kindly to him on the edge of the area. The striker had time
  and space to finish, perhaps more than he realised, but rushed a tame shot
  straight at Roberts. Beto also headed wide from Mykolenko’s deep cross into
  the Mansfield six-yard box. It was not all one-way traffic following Alcaraz’s
  breakthrough, however. Mansfield substitute Luke Bolton threatened an
  equaliser when cutting across Coleman and unleashing a powerful shot that
  appeared destined for the far corner until it struck James Tarkowski’s head
  and deflected over. Armstrong almost created a second goal with a
  defence-splitting pass to Iliman Ndiaye but the Everton substitute, tumbling
  under pressure, fired into the side-netting. But Armstrong would get his
  second assist of the night. With a minute remaining Garner picked out the
  youngster’s run behind the Mansfield defence with a beautiful ball. The
  midfielder squared along the face of Roberts’ goal and Beto was perfectly
  placed to convert.
