  I am pretty sure that many of those involved in Thatcher-inspired anarchism
  were, like me, a recipient of her only successful policy, the Enterprise
  Allowance Scheme (‘Why not work the system’? How punks inspired by Thatcher
  built a Hull housing cooperative, 26 August). Almost everyone I knew in the
  arts in the 1980s used the £40 a week for creative purposes, usually in
  conflict with her government. It should be brought back. Stephen Dorril
  Netherthong, West Yorkshire • While I commend Ed Davey for taking a stance on
  Donald Trump’s intransigence towards the genocide in Gaza (Lib Dem leader to
  boycott king’s Trump banquet in protest over Gaza, 27 August), surely a more
  impactful approach would be to attend the dinner and address Trump in front of
  the king. I doubt Trump will even notice Mr Davey’s absence. Paul Checketts
  Cheltenham • While I’m not a fan of Taylor Swift, I have to say how refreshing
  it was to see the picture of her and her fiance, Travice Kelce, on your front
  page (26 August). Yes, keep reporting on all the news, awful as it is at the
  moment, but also keep reminding us that there is still some joy and positivity
  in the world. Barbara Thompson Aston, South Yorkshire • I am disappointed that
  the front page of the Journal section of your print edition (27 August)
  carried not one but six pictures of the alleged MP for Clacton. In terms of
  the much-quoted “oxygen of publicity”, this could hardly have been necessary.
  Fiona Allen Edinburgh • Living, as I do, in the Palatine County of Lancashire,
  I am thinking of starting a left-of-centre political party called Palatine
  Action. Charles A Jepson Blackburn, Lancashire • Have an opinion on anything

  considered for publication in our letters section.
