  Less than a year after exiting the 2022 Wimbledon quarter-final on the All
  England Club’s pristine No 1 Court, Cristian Garín found himself 10,000 miles
  away on a hard court on the Pacific island of Nouméa, New Caledonia. The
  Chilean, who had a career-high ranking of world No 17, had signed up for an
  ATP Challenger event, tennis’s second-tier tour, mostly attracting players
  outside the top 100, after a wrist injury forced him to miss two ATP Masters
  1000 events. By January 2023, Garín sat at a precarious No 82. An unforgiving
  ranking system, determined by tournament performances over the past 52 weeks,
  waits for no one. Even players like Garín, once among the world’s best, can
  find themselves back in purgatory after a bad spell. “In the beginning, it was
  difficult to find motivation,” says the 29-year-old after a long pause. “The
  cities, conditions are not the best, different from when you play the best
  tournaments. The Challengers are tough. Sometimes I get very upset because you
  go a long way to win 30 matches and you’re still outside the top 100. It’s way
  too much.” The life of a player can be far from fancy. Casual fans may look
  toward Carlos Alcaraz’s lucrative sponsorship deals with envy, but those on
  the fringes of the top 100 and beyond live a starkly contrasting reality. The
  less glamorous side of the sport involves endless travelling, cost cutting to
  make ends meet and battling bouts of loneliness. Kevin Clancy, a sports
  psychologist who worked with Ireland’s top players, believes tennis and golf
  are the most psychologically demanding sports. He says: “It’s roughly about
  20% of the time that you’re on court and hitting the ball, so there’s 80% of
  the time where you’re doing a lot of thinking. “Tennis is a sport that
  mentally could beat you up really, really badly. For players at Challenger
  level, it’s about survival. They need to play more tournaments and have that
  constant pressure of, ‘I need to perform and get points’. “A lot of times
  those players are sleeping on floors. They’re sharing maybe a motel room with
  a number of other players. In some cases they may even struggle to have enough
  money to buy proper food. “These players are playing in front of a man and his
  dog in the middle of nowhere. It’s really tough from a psychological
  perspective.” When the Serbian professional Dusan Lajovic first started on
  tour, he relished the new experiences of travelling to far-flung countries.
  But his youthful exuberance quickly wore off after years of gruelling 11-month
  schedules. In 2023, he revealed his battles with depression and anxiety.
  Lajovic, once ranked 23rd in the world and now aged 35, says: “It’s not just
  forehands and backhands, it’s how much can you suffer? How much can you
  travel? How much can you sleep in different beds every week? We take almost as
  many flights as pilots. It’s a lonely sport. “When you’re hitting 30, you’re
  trying to nest somewhere, start a family. But tennis doesn’t allow you that.
  It’s not just saying, OK, this is for me, I’m going to be strong, because
  you’re going hit walls. It takes a toll on your body, your mental health.”
  Players dedicate their entire lives to the sport. Japan’s Taro Daniel would
  know, having moved across the globe to Spain when he was 14. “To put into
  perspective, it’s 20 years more dedication than a doctor to be here,” the
  32-year‑old says, chuckling. “And even then, 90% of people don’t make it.”
  Germany’s Maximilian Marterer, now 30, began the nomadic life from the age of
  12. “If I’m healthy, I spend 10, 15 weeks max [per year] at home,” he says.
  “Not only me, all of us have seen a lot of places, but we also missed many
  cool moments at home.” From Clancy’s experience, a strong support system is
  vital. “It could be family, friends or a partner,” he says. “Yes, they may be
  physically apart, but are they connected to them? On WhatsApp, Zoom, whatever,
  it’s extremely important. You need to have a routine in place after a match.”
  For all their sacrifices, a juicy financial return is far from guaranteed. In
  2024, Nikoloz Basilashvili returned from an elbow injury and earned $63,183 in
  prize money. But after subtracting flight costs and paying his coaches, the
  Georgian said he made a net loss of about $120,000. “I wanted to quit after my
  injury because I was very burned out for many years,” he says. “You are mostly
  alone and you don’t really have a lot of friends to talk to. I don’t know if
  there is any other sport like this, to take a flight on the same day you play
  a match and then next week you are in another city. But then I decided to look
  at tennis in a different way, to enjoy it a little bit more.” As a former
  world No 16 with more than $9m in career earnings, Basilashvili could afford
  the short-term hit. Others, like India’s Sumit Nagal, once reduced to a mere
  €900 in his bank account, do not enjoy the same luxury. “All I can say is you
  need to keep on playing, keep on winning. That’s how it is,” the world No 302
  says. Most persist to fuel their love for the sport. For Nicolás Jarry, a
  former world No 16 who dropped out of the top 100 while battling vestibular
  neuritis – an ear condition affecting his balance and vision – tennis serves
  an additional purpose; as his form of self expression. “I was born the oldest
  child, so I follow a lot of rules,” he says. “When somebody tells me to do A,
  and it’s not going to kill me, I will do A, even if I think B. Now, I follow
  my instincts. It motivates me to see how far I can go following my gut.”
