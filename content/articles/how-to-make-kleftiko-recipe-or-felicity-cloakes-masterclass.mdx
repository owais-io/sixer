  This Greek classic is said to be named after the klephts – sheep rustlers who
  slow-cooked their ill-gotten gains in underground pits to avoid detection, or
  perhaps to avoid having to share the delicious results. As a law-abiding
  citizen, I prefer to use an oven, but I have to concede that those naughty
  bandits knew a thing or two about flavour. Prep 20 min Marinate 8 hr+ Cook 4½
  hr Rest 30 min+ Serves 6 1 bone-in lamb shoulder (about 2kg) 1½ heads garlic
  Olive oil 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp dried oregano 1 tsp salt 2 lemons 1kg waxy
  potatoes (see step 3) 1 large red onion 1 red pepper 12 cherry tomatoes 2 bay
  leaves 1 A note on the meat Kleftiko is traditionally made with lamb shoulder,
  which is ideally suited to slow cooking. You could use a shoulder from an
  older sheep or goat instead, but neither will be as tender as lamb; they will
  be stronger in flavour, though. If you prefer leg, treat it in the same way,
  but bear in mind that it will probably require a little less time in the oven.
  2 Marinate the meat Peel and crush the half head of garlic, and rub the meat
  all over with olive oil. Sprinkle the cinnamon, oregano and salt all over the
  lamb, then top with the crushed garlic and the juice of one lemon, and rub in
  using your hands (wash and rub your hands with the cut lemon to help get rid
  of the smell of garlic afterwards). Cover and chill for eight to 12 hours. 3 A
  note on the potatoes Shortly before cooking, heat the oven to 160C (140C
  fan)/325F/gas 3. While it’s heating up, prepare the vegetables. Waxy potatoes
  (such as charlottes, maris peers, anyas or anything described as a salad
  variety) are the best bet here, because they will keep their shape during the
  long cooking time. There’s no need to peel them unless they’re very dirty. 4
  Prep the vegetables Cut the potatoes into wedges (if they’re small, just cut
  them in half; leave them whole if they’re real babies). Peel the onion (a
  yellow onion would also be fine here, as would shallots, peeled and cut in
  half), then cut it into chunky wedges. Halve the pepper, remove and discard
  the stalk, pith and seeds, then cut the flesh into thick strips. 5 Other
  flavourings Wash the tomatoes – if you prefer, use larger ones, in which case
  cut them in half or, for really large fruit, into wedges. You could also add
  big chunks of feta (don’t crumble it, otherwise it will dissolve into the
  gravy) or kefalotyri, a few sprigs of fresh oregano, fennel, or even chunks of
  courgette or aubergine, though those aren’t strictly traditional. 6 A note on
  the cooking vessel Take a large lidded casserole dish that’s big enough to
  hold the lamb with the lid on tightly, or use a roasting tin lined with enough
  baking paper to fold over the top of the joint on both sides (you’ll probably
  need at least two sheets of paper set at right angles to each other). Put the
  potatoes, onions, pepper and tomatoes in the casserole or tray. 7 Add lemon,
  garlic and bay Lay the marinated lamb on top of the vegetables, then pour any
  remaining marinade over the top. Cut the remaining head of garlic and lemon in
  half across their thickest points, squeeze the lemon briefly on top of the
  lamb (no need to wring it absolutely dry), then tuck the lemon shells, the
  half garlic heads and the bay leaves in and around the joint. 8 Cover and bake
  Pour 200ml water into the dish. If using a casserole dish, tuck a damp piece
  of greaseproof paper on top of the meat, then cover with the lid; if using a
  roasting tray, sprinkle the overhanging paper with water, then fold it up and
  over the meat and tuck in to form a sealed package. Bake for four to five
  hours, until the meat is very tender. 9 Finishing touches When the lamb is
  soft, turn up the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 6 and remove the lid and/or
  greaseproof paper. Roast for a further 10-15 minutes, then lift out the meat
  and set aside to rest for about 30 minutes. Put the pan of vegetables back in
  the oven for 15 minutes, until they’re starting to brown, keep warm until the
  meat has finished resting, then carve and serve up.
