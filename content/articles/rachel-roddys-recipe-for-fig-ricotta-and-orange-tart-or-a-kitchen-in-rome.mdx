  Yesterday, we left a garden with a fig tree as tall as a house to catch a
  train to Rome Termini station, where tiny, thrill-seeking figs grow on the
  tracks. The fearless fig tree is a descendant of the prehistoric wild
  caprifig, which spread from Caria (hence the species name carica) in ancient
  Anatolia, across the Mediterranean. Cultivation is thought to have started in
  Egypt and the Levant, probably between 4000 and 2700BC; particular evidence of
  this is the common fig (Ficus carica) on the stone walls within ancient
  Egyptian tombs called mastaba, painted so their occupants could enjoy the
  fruit in the afterlife. Dozens of examples are described in a research paper
  by the professor of Egyptology Noha Hany Gerges Salama, including paintings
  within a fifth-dynasty mastaba of Iymery, in Giza. One painting in particular
  depicts two fig trees, both of which have a boy standing in their branches and
  picking fruit, while men under the trees collect fallen figs in baskets.
  Another exquisite painting shows two men seated opposite each other, one of
  whom is holding a plate holding three enormous figs. Salama notes what a
  common food source fresh and dried figs were in ancient Egypt, and used often
  to enhance flavour and sweeten, but also how figs, their leaves and the sap
  from the branches provided a natural rennet for cheese-making and yeast for
  wine-making. The many varieties of figs fall into two broad groups: those that
  reproduce without pollination, and those that rely on little gnat-sized fig
  wasps to do it for them. Either way, figs are botanically not a single fruit,
  but a cluster of more than a thousand tiny flowers, which are thought of as
  seeds. Figs are also one of the few fruits to taste best when over-ripe, when
  those thousand tiny fruits have matured into an ambrosial cross between honey
  and jam, and as a result perfect for attracting both wasps and this week’s
  recipe. It’s a variation on the wonderful crostata di ricotta e visciole (sour
  cherry and ricotta tart) from the Jewish-Roman tradition, using figs and
  orange instead, and I have also varied the pastry by adding some (optional)
  orange zest and ground almonds. Always work quickly with pastry, and with cold
  hands, and don’t skip the chilling or the preheating of the baking tray, which
  prevents a soggy bottom. And if you can’t find figs, fig jam works
  beautifully, too. You can serve this tart hot out of the oven, but it is
  better, I think, when it has cooled a bit, so both the ricotta and fig layers
  have had the chance to firm up, which makes it easier to cut. Like its cherry
  cousin, the tart is also wonderful at room temperature and fridge-cold,
  especially for breakfast. Fig, ricotta and orange tart Serves 8–10 150g cold
  butter, diced 250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 50g ground almonds 1
  pinch of salt 60g icing sugar 2 medium eggs, lightly beaten, plus extra for
  brushing 1 unwaxed orange, 2 strips of zest pared off, the rest of the zest
  finely grated, plus 2 tbsp juice 400g fresh figs, chopped, or 300g fig jam
  175g caster sugar 500g ricotta 1 egg Rub the butter into the flour and ground
  almonds until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, icing sugar,
  grated orange zest and eggs, then mix to make a soft pastry. Wrap in
  greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Put the figs
  in a pan with the two strips of orange zest, orange juice and 100g of the
  sugar. Bring to a boil, turn down to a lively simmer and cook for five to
  seven minutes, until the figs are tender and collapsing, but not mushy. On a
  lightly floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a disc a
  little larger than a 24cm tart tin. Drape the pastry over a rolling pin,
  unfurl it into the tin and push it into the corners. Trim off the excess
  pastry with a knife. Spoon the cooked figs into the shell. Combine the
  ricotta, egg and remaining 75g sugar, beat until creamy and smooth, then
  carefully spoon on top of the figs. Roll the remaining pastry into a circle,
  then cut this into strips to make a lattice, which you can lay on top of the
  ricotta as simply or as cleverly as you like. Brush with beaten egg, then bake
  the tart on a preheated tray in the middle of a 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4
  oven for 45 minutes, until the lattice is golden and the ricotta topping
  slightly puffed.
