  My favourite childhood outfit: ‘The coat I inherited from Grandpa became my
  teenage refuge’

  I was 15 when Grandpa died. He was 69, too young, but on the plus side he was
  doing what he most loved – digging on an archaeological site. We weren’t close
  in the way I was with Granny; he could be quite scary. But we got along fine
  and I liked him. Mum said I could help myself from his wardrobe. I had only
  known him dressed for retirement, in blue workers’ overalls for archaeological
  digging, or baggy beige shorts for caravanning holidays. But it seemed he had
  been quite dapper back in the day. I helped myself to collarless shirts and a
  couple of suits (the best was a silvery-grey mohair one that wouldn’t have
  looked out of place in Paul Weller’s wardrobe). And this overcoat. It was a
  proper coat – black, knee-length, heavy, silk-lined – made by Crombie of
  Aberdeen and worn by statesmen and royals, but also movie stars and pop stars.
  And now by me. I thought it was cool, and it became more than a coat; it was a
  place of refuge, a thick new outer layer of protection, against not just the
  cold but teenage vulnerability and insecurity. Plus, it was a little bit of
  Grandpa, hard to forget with the faint whiff of pipe smoke that lingered, even
  after dry cleaning. I’m probably 16 in the photo. You can just make out my
  Echo &amp; the Bunnymen badge on the lapel; I’d quite liked to have been in
  Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. I would have been wearing Doc Martens, or maybe my
  favourite burgundy winkle-pickers. I can still smell the green Country Born
  gel in my hair. A night out would have required more backcombing for a serious
  80s haystack, maybe a little eyeliner. I’m not sure what Grandpa would have
  made of that. I wore his coat throughout the rest of my teens, sat on it in
  parks, slept under it on other people’s sofas. And then I guess I decided it
  wasn’t cool any more, because it disappeared – from photos and from memory.
  Until the other day, at Mum’s house (which used to be Granny and Grandpa’s
  house). I went to turn on the immersion heater, and there it was, hanging at
  the back of the airing cupboard. A little frayed at the edges and coming apart
  at some of the seams, but aren’t we all. It must be 90 years old now. So I
  reinherited it. I haven’t worn it much, I don’t really know when to. Both
  shabby and posh, there now seems something funereal about it. Undertakerly,
  even. I’ll wear it next time I’m paying my respects. It’s good to have it back
  though, hanging at the back of my own cupboard, maybe to be discovered by one
  of my sons – or theirs – somewhere down the line.
