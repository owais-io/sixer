  Officials in a rural Tennessee town voted on Tuesday to approve agreements to
  turn a former prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a
  private company, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists
  during a contentious public meeting. The five-member board of aldermen in
  Mason, along with the mayor, Eddie Noeman, and vice-mayor, Reynaldo Givhan,
  met in a fire station garage to discuss converting the closed West Tennessee
  detention facility into a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)
  detention center run by CoreCivic Inc, America’s second-largest private prison
  operator. Also present were a few dozen vocal, angry members of the public who
  oppose allowing Ice to house immigrants in Mason who have been taken into
  custody, as Donald Trump pushes his mass deportation agenda forward. The US
  president has touted a Florida detention facility where allegations of
  mistreatment of detainees have drawn lawsuits from civil rights advocates and
  environmental groups. And CoreCivic is buoyed up by its increasing immigration
  detention contracts as well as the prospect of many more to come amid the new
  Republican legislation providing billions for Ice and its parent agency, the
  Department of Homeland Security. But the company is also under a cloud of
  criticism for some of the conditions reported at its facilities, as it cashes
  in. This includes Tennessee but most recently, as a result of an investigation
  by the Guardian, concerning a federal detention facility the company runs in
  New Mexico. In Tennessee on Tuesday night, the first vote of the meeting
  resulted in approval for a contract with CoreCivic to resume operating the
  facility, which was closed in 2021 after Joe Biden ordered the Department of
  Justice to stop renewing contracts with private detention facilities. Trump
  reversed that order in January. The second vote, to approve an agreement with
  Ice, also passed. It is not immediately known when the facility will reopen.
  Noeman said he wanted to reopen the shuttered prison to bring jobs and
  economic development to the town, which has struggled with financial problems
  and needs infrastructure improvements. With a population of about 1,300, Mason
  is located about 40 miles north-east of Memphis and at least two-thirds of the
  residents are Black, according to US census data. When it was open, the prison
  was the town’s largest employer and an important economic engine. Noeman
  called turning the closed prison over to CoreCivic and Ice a “win-win
  situation”, drawing loud boos in the room. “It’s nothing personal about any
  immigrant,” Noeman said, adding moments later that “to give jobs to the people
  is what I’m looking for.” At times, Noeman argued with attenders, questioning
  whether they actually lived in Mason and telling them: “You don’t know what
  you’re talking about.” Before the meeting, board member Virginia Rivers told
  the Associated Press that she did not support turning the prison into an Ice
  facility because “I don’t like what Ice stands for, how they treat the
  people.” During the meeting, she noted that some immigrants without criminal
  records were being swept up by immigration agents and separated from their
  families. She said approving the contracts would make Mason “complicit in the
  abusive treatment of immigrants”. “We as officials of the town of Mason that
  were elected by the citizens should consider the consequences and the hurt
  that this would cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools
  and many families,” Rivers said. CoreCivic said in a statement that the Ice
  facility would create nearly 240 new jobs, and it is now advertising openings
  for detention officers at a pay rate of $26.50 per hour. “The services we
  provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone – to
  help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration
  challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people,
  and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively,” CoreCivic said.
  One of the speakers, Charles Watkins, noted that CoreCivic was the operator of
  the prison under its previous name, Corrections Corporation of America. “How
  is it that we can consistently let these organizations come into Black
  communities and then just somehow overwhelm us with the few dollars that they
  throw on the table as crumbs while they take the majority of the take back to
  wherever they came from?” Watkins said. Tennessee’s corrections agency has
  fined CoreCivic $44.7m across four prisons from 2022 through February,
  including for understaffing violations. Records obtained by AP also show the
  company has spent more than $4.4m to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court
  complaints alleging mistreatment – including at least 22 inmate deaths – at
  four Tennessee prisons and two jails from 2016 through September 2024. The
  state comptroller released scathing audits in 2017, 2020 and 2023. The
  Brentwood, Tennessee-based CoreCivic has defended itself by pointing to
  industrywide problems with hiring and keeping workers.
