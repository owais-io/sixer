  MPs have raised the alarm about a rise in abuse linked to debates around
  immigration, with some reporting levels of online harassment and death threats
  worse than during the Brexit years. The warning came after a weekend of
  protests and counter protests at hotels used to house asylum seekers, with 15
  people arrested on Saturday and demonstrations continuing into Sunday. One
  female member of parliament, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had this
  weekend reported an online rape threat linked to her support for asylum
  seekers to the police. Shipley’s Labour MP, Anna Dixon, said she had received
  death threats after the Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, Robbie Moore,
  shared “misleading” information about her stance on grooming gangs. “The
  lambasting we are all getting on social media and in the inbox is grim, from
  both sides,” said Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour’s MP for Gower. “It’s like we can’t
  do right for doing wrong and everything has become frighteningly polarised.
  “Very few people see us as the individual humans that we are – especially
  women, mums, sisters, daughters – and it’s really changed since I came into
  the house. It’s worse than Brexit. In fact I could cope with that better.”
  Another veteran Labour MP backed up her comments saying that, in their
  experience, hostility towards politicians was worse now than it had ever been.
  The Green party co-leader and MP for Bristol Central, Carla Denyer, said the
  abuse she is sent had become “noticeably worse” in the last few months,
  “escalating in some cases to violent threats”, which she had reported to the
  police. “As a leftwing and queer woman MP who speaks up frequently in support
  of refugees and LGBTIQA+ issues, I attract a lot of misogynist and homophobic
  abuse,” she said. “I wish I was surprised, but sadly it feels inevitable in
  the current political environment as the far right in the UK and across the
  world feels more and more emboldened and validated by other political parties
  dancing to their tune.” She added: “It doesn’t matter how much you disagree
  with someone, threats of violence are never, ever appropriate. And they won’t
  silence me.” Another MP said: “I’ve had some pretty unpleasant abuse. One
  [person] asked recently why I was hosting and supporting child rapists.” They
  added that the police had assured them those carrying out the abuse were “only
  a small online community”. Newer MPs also reported feeling the impact of a
  recent rise in tensions over issues including grooming gangs, small boats and
  asylum seeker hotels. “It’s horrendous,” said one MP who was elected last
  year. “I’m having to deal with daily lies about asylum seeker hotels and HMOs,
  which are entirely fabricated and are leading to huge anger and fear.” Another
  female MP said: “I have received death threats in the last six months. The
  misogyny and the hate hasn’t really stopped since I was elected [last year],
  so it always feels like it has been pretty intense and is constant.” Many of
  the MPs who voiced concerns asked to remain anonymous, fearing they would
  attract further abuse if they spoke publicly about the issue. A speaker’s
  conference on the security of MPs found only just over half (52%) of those who
  responded to a survey felt safe in their role. The biggest concern reported by
  MPs was online abuse, followed by being recognised and abused in public. “I’ve
  fought four general elections and feel things sank to all time low – so far –
  in this last 2024 one,” another Labour MP, Rupa Huq, said. “The speaker’s
  conference, which I serve on, is investigating these issues and our witnesses
  have included Meta and X to the Electoral Commission, but their focus is
  during electoral campaigning or contests when, sadly, these issues rear their
  heads in between elections.” On Saturday, the MP Anna Dixon said police were
  investigating death threats over her position on a national inquiry into
  grooming gangs after Moore claimed she had been “dismissing calls for an
  inquiry since day one”. Dixon said she only voted against a Tory proposal for
  a national inquiry into grooming gangs because it included an amendment to the
  children’s wellbeing and schools bill. Moore said he condemned any threats of
  violence, but insisted he had raised “legitimate concerns”. Brendan Cox, the
  co-founder of the Together Coalition and the husband of the MP Jo Cox, who was
  murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016, said mainstream politicians were
  fanning the flames of division. He said “difficult policy positions” needed to
  be debated more civilly. “Threats to MPs don’t come from nowhere,” he said.
  “When mainstream politicians use violent or extreme rhetoric, dehumanisation
  of opponents increases and violence becomes more likely.” On Sunday, protests
  continued against the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, with
  demonstrators decked in flags gathered outside the Castle Bromwich Holiday Inn
  in Birmingham and police in London standing guard outside the Britannia hotel
  in Canary Wharf. This weekend there was also a campaign to put up union jack
  and Saint George’s cross flags across the country gather pace. According to
  the anti-extremist groups Hope Not Hate and Stand Up to Racism, the campaign
  called “operation raise the colours” has been partly organised by well-known
  far-right figures. On Saturday, police in Basildon in Essex arrested a
  33-year-old man on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and
  conspiracy to commit criminal damage, after a video appeared to show racist
  abuse being shouted as red crosses were painted on the walls of a row of white
  buildings in the town. In Stevenage, a man claimed he was attacked with a
  petrol bomb in the early hours of Saturday morning while hanging flags from
  lamp-posts. “It appears that the victim was struck by a glass bottle
  containing a lit rag and sustained a cut to his head,” Chf Insp Sarah
  Gilbertson of Hertfordshire police said, appealing for anyone with information
  to come forward. Amid the febrile atmosphere, the government has set out plans
  to introduce a fast-track asylum appeals process, which will speed up the
  removal of people with no right to be in the UK. Labour has also pledged to
  end the use of asylum hotels by 2029. “We cannot carry on with these
  completely unacceptable delays in appeals as a result of the system we have
  inherited, which mean that failed asylum seekers stay in the system for years
  on end at huge cost to the taxpayer,” said the home secretary, Yvette Cooper.
  Dan Jarvis, the security minister and chair of the defending democracy
  taskforce, said: “Vile threats and the intimidation of those who serve in
  public life is utterly unacceptable. “We are absolutely determined to ensure
  all elected representatives can carry out their democratic duties without
  suffering harassment and the defending democracy taskforce works to ensure a
  whole-of-government response to the threats to our democracy. “While there
  will always be a place for robust debate, there will never be a place for fear
  in our democracy.”
