  Ready to give up social media? ‘Advice pollution’ might just get you there |

  I may have found what will finally wean me off social media. It’s this “things
  I’ve learned” trend. Take, for example, advice that will supposedly “change
  your brain chemistry”, courtesy of someone who is definitely not a
  neuroscientist. Or “my nutrition rules”, from a dewy, gen Alpha sylph who
  doesn’t realise what they actually have is a teenager’s metabolism. Or “45
  things you need to understand” about a place from someone who has spent 45
  minutes there. Endless lists of the bleeding obvious: eat intuitively, embrace
  nature, exercise compassion, remain curious, be childlike, contact friends,
  put down your phone, put your head in a blender. OK, not that last one, but
  it’s how this stuff makes me feel. I don’t know what to call it – expertise
  overload? Advice pollution? A bottomless pit of wisdom brain rot? – but
  authoritatively delivered life advice dominates what I see online, from
  Substack (the online home of cosy, bookish elders) to TikTok (the opposite).
  It’s not just my algorithm or demographic: men, young people, pregnant people
  and new parents all get inundated with advice, albeit with different slants. I
  sort of admire the confidence it must take to tell people what to do. I can
  barely muster a tentative suggestion of what to have for dinner (crisps?). But
  it also makes me pine for the internet before everything was a bossy,
  bullet-pointed self-optimisation plan; for the gentler days of cat memes and
  rambling blog posts about strangers’ marital problems. Of course, no one is
  forcing me to consume this content, to roll my eyes at another earnest reel or
  wrathfully scroll through 1,000 words telling me to “prioritise rest”. But I’m
  a sucker for it, which is exactly why it’s everywhere: it gets us “engaging”
  and consuming. It’s undeniably appealing to be told how to live your life when
  you’re flailing, failing and bewildered (and aren’t we all?). Unfortunately,
  the only thing I’ve realised from endlessly clicking is that the cure for my
  confusion will not come from content creators. Uh oh – did I just offer
  “things I’ve learned” advice? • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist
