  Ministers have announced a clampdown on “cowboy” cosmetic procedures,
  including liquid Brazilian butt lifts, with stricter rules on who is allowed
  to perform the procedures in England. Wes Streeting, the health secretary,
  plans to introduce legislation next year restricting who can access and
  perform aesthetic treatments. Labour has warned that the industry is a “wild
  west” because of a lack of regulation around who can administer treatments
  such as dermatological filler and Botox injections. At present a licence is
  not required to perform such procedures in England. Health department
  officials said botched treatments had left people “maimed” and suffering from
  “dangerous complications, permanent scarring and even death”. Ministers plan
  to introduce new rules whereby only qualified healthcare professionals can
  deliver high-risk procedures such as liquid Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs).
  Providers will need to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and
  those found to be breaking rules could face sanctions and financial penalties.
  Clinics offering lower-risk procedures such as Botox and fillers will need to
  be licensed by their local authority. The proposals will be subject to a
  consultation early next year that will seek views on the types of procedures
  that should be covered by the new regulations. Liquid BBLs involve injecting
  filler into the buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger or more
  rounded. The procedure can cause serious side-effects such as blood clots and
  sepsis. A 33-year-old woman, Alice Webb, died last year after complications
  from a suspected liquid BBL in Gloucestershire. Last month, the Chartered
  Trading Standards Institute warned that fat injections, BBLs, Botox and
  fillers were being offered by untrained people in places such as public
  toilets. Health officials launched an investigation after several people had
  reactions to Botox-like injections this year. The government urged people
  always to ask for providers’ qualifications and insurance and to be wary of
  “suspiciously cheap” offers. Restrictions on high-risk treatments will be
  introduced via an amendment to the CQC’s regulations, while licensing for
  providers of lower-risk procedures will be introduced via secondary
  legislation. The government also plans to bring in restrictions for under-18s
  on high-risk cosmetic procedures unless these have been approved by a
  healthcare professional. It became illegal for children to receive Botox and
  dermal fillers in England in 2021. The Scottish government announced plans in
  May to regulate aesthetic treatments, but there have been no moves to tighten
  regulation in Wales or Northern Ireland. “The government’s move to regulate
  non-surgical aesthetic procedures is an important first step forward for
  patient safety,” said Tim Mitchell, the president of the Royal College of
  Surgeons. But Mitchell stressed that regulation should go further, by ensuring
  that procedures such as buttock or breast augmentation are performed only by
  surgeons who have been recognised by the Cosmetic Surgery Board. “This will
  ensure high standards of care, reduce avoidable harm and give patients the
  confidence they deserve when seeking aesthetic treatments,” he said. Sue
  Davies, the head of consumer protection policy at Which?, said the changes
  would “mean little without a serious overhaul of consumer enforcement teams
  such as trading standards, which are currently stretched too thinly to
  properly investigate these rogue traders who are putting consumers at risk”.
  Millie Kendall, the chief executive of the British Beauty Council, which
  represents the industry, said the changes “will help instil confidence as well
  as helping to prevent the normalisation of horror stories that have become
  synonymous with our sector”. Karin Smyth, a health minister, said: “The
  cosmetics industry has been plagued by a wild west of dodgy practitioners and
  procedures. There are countless horror stories of cosmetic cowboys causing
  serious, catastrophic damage. “This government is taking action to protect
  those seeking treatments, support honest and competent practitioners, and root
  out the cowboys as part of our plan for change. “This isn’t about stopping
  anyone from getting treatments – it’s about preventing rogue operators from
  exploiting people at the expense of their safety and keeping people safe.
  We’re giving them peace of mind and reducing the cost to the NHS of fixing
  botched procedures.”
