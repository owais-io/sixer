  A gut-wrenching new film about a five-year-old girl killed by Israeli forces
  in Gaza last year received a 23-minute standing ovation after its premiere at
  the Venice film festival on Wednesday. The Voice of Hind Rajab, directed by
  Tunisian film-maker Kaouther Ben Hania, had been described by critics as ‘‘the
  most powerful and urgent entry of this year’s festival”. It left much of the
  audience and many journalists sobbing as it was screened for the first time.
  The film reconstructs the final, frantic phone call of Hind Rajab, who in
  January 2024 was trapped in the wreckage of a car in northern Gaza, surrounded
  by the bodies of her uncles and four young cousins. Hiding beneath a seat and
  the only one still alive, Hind managed to contact the Palestinian Red Crescent
  by phone. However, the child and the medics looking for her were killed by
  Israeli forces. The Israeli military has not announced a formal investigation
  into the case. Ben Hania said: “When I first heard the voice of Hind Rajab,
  there was something beyond her words. It was the voice of Gaza itself calling
  for help – and no one could reach her.” The film makes chilling use of the
  real phone recordings of Hind Rajab, but tells the story through a dramatised
  Red Crescent team which is trying to coordinate her rescue. In a statement on
  behalf of the entire film-making team, actor Saja Kilani said: “The voice of
  Hind Rajab does not need our defence. This film is not an opinion or a
  fantasy. It is anchored in truth. “Hind’s story carries the weight of an
  entire people, it is not hers alone. Her voice is one among 19,000 children
  who lost their lives in Gaza in the last two years alone. “It is the voice of
  every mother, father, doctor, teacher, artist, journalist, volunteer,
  paramedic, each with the right to live, to dream, to exist in dignity, yet all
  of it was stolen in front of unblinking eyes. And these are only the voices we
  know. Beyond every number is a story that never got to be told.” Motaz
  Malhees, a Palestinian actor from Jenin, said: “When I was 10 years old, I
  lived this life. Hearing Hind’s voice took me straight back to my childhood. I
  felt as if I had died a thousand times. This wasn’t acting. This was my life.”
  Hind Rajab’s mother, Wissam Hamada, said she hoped the film would help end the
  war. “The whole world has left us to die, to go hungry, to live in fear and to
  be forcibly displaced without doing anything,” Hamada told AFP by phone from
  Gaza City, where she lives with her five-year-old son. AFP contributed to this
