  When Serena Williams was featured in a People magazine story on Thursday
  morning discussing her 31lb weight loss, the rollout had all the hallmarks of
  an advertisement draped in the thin veil of an all-caps EXCLUSIVE. Vogue’s
  social channels amplified their own access, NBC’s Today show gave her a
  one-on-one segment and Elle published a carefully packaged interview in which
  Williams declared she wanted to break the stigma around weight-loss drugs,
  each of them in lockstep with what appeared to be a hard 9am press embargo.
  This vintage Jill Smoller quadrafecta was not a spontaneous confessional; it
  was a coordinated media blitz pegged to the US Open, the tentpole event of
  American tennis, which kicks off on Sunday in earnest. Yet for all the
  precision and polish, it was unmistakably a commercial. The product wasn’t
  just Williams’s refined physique, already the subject of months-long
  speculation among her 32 million followers across social media. It was a
  telehealth service called Ro – a company on whose board her husband, Alexis
  Ohanian, conveniently sits, a disclosure the press release at least did the
  courtesy of including in a footnote – promoting access to GLP-1 weight-loss
  drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound. Williams isn’t merely dabbling in
  one-off spon con. Her partnership with Ro is a promised multiyear campaign
  across billboards, digital platforms and television spots. In the first of
  them she looks into the camera and says: “After kids, it’s the medicine my
  body needed.” Ro’s CEO, Zach Reitano, was explicit about why she was chosen:
  precisely because some will say she doesn’t need GLP-1s. “That’s why she’s
  perfect for it,” he explained. In other words, the point of putting Williams
  in the ad is to normalize weight-loss drugs as lifestyle products for people
  who aren’t typical patients. On Today, Williams presented herself as anything
  but a corner-cutter. “As an athlete and as someone that has done everything, I
  just couldn’t get my weight to where I needed to be at a healthy place, and
  believe me, I don’t take shortcuts,” she said. She recalled running and
  walking for hours after giving birth to her daughters, only to plateau at the
  same number on the scale. The Elle interview sharpened that story further:
  Williams spoke of 30,000-step days, four-hour summer training sessions and her
  coach raising concerns about her weight in the HBO documentary series Being
  Serena. “I needed to try something different,” she said. “Sometimes people do
  absolutely everything, and it doesn’t work.” Her message was clear: she had
  done the work, and the drug was merely the missing piece. The public response
  across tennis Twitter and entertainment blogs has generally been divided. Some
  fans expressed resignation: if even the greatest athlete of her generation
  needed medication to shed weight, what chance does anyone else have? Others
  were angry that a global sporting icon, once celebrated for defying toxic
  beauty standards, would lend her name to a pharmaceutical fad already
  criticized for being over-prescribed. And then there were those who shrugged
  that Williams had always represented the family business. Much like Taylor
  Swift appearing on Travis Kelce’s podcast feels less like happenstance than
  deft cross-promotion, Williams’s tie-up with Ro isn’t solely about personal
  health – it’s #couplegoals on a macro scale. Many saw Thursday’s collective
  messaging not as candor but as advertorial: personal struggle framed as
  stealth marketing. In an era when audiences are used to celebrities weaving
  mental-health confessions or fitness “journeys” into commercial deals,
  Williams’s campaign was interpreted less as openness than strategy. The
  insistence that GLP-1s aren’t an “easy way out” didn’t so much silence critics
  as underscore the broader worry: that even someone as disciplined as Williams
  needed pharmaceutical help to be deemed “healthy”, leaning in to the very
  thinness culture she once resisted. To many of her admirers, this was more
  than a sponsorship deal – it felt like a diminishment of her athletic legacy,
  a suggestion that all the titles and training were still not enough in a
  society where appearance trumps achievement. That contrast is striking because
  Williams’s career was built on defiance and being the ultimate outsider. A
  Black Jehovah’s Witness from Compton, she kicked in the doors of a country
  club sport with beaded braids and an unyielding game, only to endure years of
  skepticism, mockery and outright racism. Yet she leveraged those pressures
  into dominance, winning 23 grand slam singles titles and redefining power,
  athleticism and relentlessness in women’s tennis. For millions of fans, she
  was proof that success did not require conforming to narrow ideals of beauty
  or femininity. She bent a sport and an industry to her will, embodying
  strength and resilience for generations of Black women who saw in her an
  avatar of possibility. By aligning with Ro, Williams has gone from embodying
  resistance to helping mainstream an industry built on shrinking bodies. The
  woman who once crafted a superpower from her double burdens – of being born a
  woman and being born Black in America – has chosen to reinforce the very
  culture that sought to erase her. Critics argue it’s especially dissonant
  given her own history of nearly dying twice – once from a pulmonary embolism
  after stepping on broken glass, once from a traumatic C-section recovery –
  experiences that exposed the structural failures of American healthcare,
  particularly for Black women. If anyone could have credibly used her platform
  to call for systemic reform, it was her. Instead, she’s lent her name to a
  for-profit enterprise that markets weight-loss drugs to those who can already
  afford concierge medicine. And make no mistake: this is part of a bigger push.
  Between 8% and 10% of Americans are now taking GLP-1s, according to
  PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ro has already run a controversial subway campaign
  showing injected bellies and signed former NBA star Charles Barkley to inject
  himself on camera. Competitor Hims &amp; Hers splashed out for a Super Bowl
  commercial. All have drawn fire: from politicians who complained about skipped
  side-effect disclosures, from activists who saw body-shaming propaganda and
  from doctors worried about malnourishment. Unlike traditional pharma,
  telehealth companies in the US don’t have to run long read-outs of risks. They
  can present drugs like lifestyle accessories. And now they have a real
  American hero as their most bankable face in the gold rush for market share.
  Williams is not alone in this. She joins a growing roster of celebrities who
  have gone public about GLP-1 use, among them Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg,
  Meghan Trainor and Amy Schumer. But if others generated curiosity, Serena
  brings legitimacy. Few endorsements could signal more clearly that weight-loss
  drugs have moved from Hollywood whispers into the glossy mainstream. The money
  question lingers uncomfortably. Williams is not a retired athlete scrambling
  for relevance. She is married to an uber-wealthy tech founder and has amassed
  generational wealth of her own, yet her endorsements in recent years have
  increasingly tracked with the aesthetics of Silicon Valley affluence and a
  curated tradwife domesticity, a jarring turn for someone once defined by
  rebellion. As a Black woman in the public eye, Williams has always faced a
  disproportionate level of scrutiny over her body – her musculature, her
  curves, her clothing choices – scrutiny that her white peers rarely endured in
  both volume and scale. Chris Evert wrote her a patronizing open letter
  doubting her commitment. Pat Cash declared her washed up (in 2007!). That grim
  history helps explain why many of her fans in friendly spaces like the Shade
  Room comments responded with empathy, acknowledging both the hormonal
  struggles she described and the impossible double bind she has lived under: at
  once a legend who redefined beauty and power, and a woman relentlessly policed
  for the body that made her great. But still others lamented the disappearance
  of the muscular body she once defended, and suspected that she was reshaping
  herself, and her brand, to fit into that conventional mold. GLP-1 drugs can be
  life-changing for people with obesity or diabetes. But they also underscore
  grotesque inequality. Wealthy Americans spend thousands a month to stop
  snacking. But pharmacies ration supply and insurers refuse coverage. For
  critics, the glamorization of the practice by Williams, once the living
  rebuttal to those hierarchies, only deepens the inequity. Williams’s greatness
  on the court is beyond any credible dispute. But her embrace of GLP-1 culture
  is a reminder that even the most untouchable of legends can be co-opted, and
  that in a society obsessed with shrinking, even our icons are made to
  disappear.
