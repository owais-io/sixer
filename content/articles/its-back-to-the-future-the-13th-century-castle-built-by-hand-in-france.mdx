  It was the summer of 1999 and, in a disused quarry in a forest in deepest
  Burgundy, a dozen or so incongruously attired figures were toiling away,
  hewing limestone blocks, chiselling oaken beams and hammering 6in nails. The
  rough outline of what they were building was discernible, just: a perimeter
  wall a substantial 200 metres long and three metres thick; round towers, two
  large and two small, to mark the four corners; another pair flanking the main
  gateway. Outside the clearing it was almost the 21st century. Inside, it was
  1230 and, using only medieval tools and techniques and materials sourced
  locally or made on site, work had just begun on the castle of Guilbert
  Courtenay, a fictitious nobleman of relatively modest means. Back then, the
  walls were half a metre high and no one had the faintest idea when – or, more
  to the point, whether – Chateau de Guédelon would ever be finished. No one,
  after all, had thought to build an early 13th-century castle by hand for about
  750 years. Just over a quarter of a century later, it still is not quite
  finished. But in the summer of 2025 it is, recognisably and rather splendidly,
  an early 13th-century French castle, complete with ramparts, turrets, vaulted
  great hall, chambers, chapel, kitchens and, a little way off in the woods, a
  working flour mill. It is also a living archaeological, architectural,
  cultural, historical, human and even scientific laboratory, praised and prized
  by everyone from medievalists and heritage restoration experts to
  professionals in the sustainable construction industry. “I’m not really sure
  what I thought would come of it. Back then, it sometimes felt like just …
  having fun with friends,” said Maryline Martin, Guédelon’s project manager
  since the start. “It’s been the most amazing adventure. And it’s worked in a
  way I never dreamed of.” Returning to Guédelon 25-plus years on provides
  something of a shock. What was once a bare, muddy expanse of rock-strewn
  ground dotted with the occasional artisan in a home-spun hemp tunic or a
  leather apron is now an actual medieval castle. There are also car parks,
  restaurants, shops, a smart eco-friendly office – and 310,000 visitors a year.
  If regional, EU and corporate money funded the hard early years, today the
  €7.5m raised annually from ticket, food and souvenir sales – including
  baskets, scarves and bookmarks, all made in Guédelon – pay the investment,
  running costs and 160 salaries of one of Burgundy’s biggest attractions. What
  it is most absolutely not, though, is a medieval theme park. “This is play,
  but serious play,” said Martin, unchanged bar her shock of grey hair. Along
  with Michel Guyot, who had already spent decades restoring a ruined local
  chateau, she was one of the founding figures of Guédelon, inspired by the
  madcap idea of building one entirely from scratch. Guyot has since retired
  from the project. “It’s about building to understand, inventing the future by
  rediscovering the past,” Martin said. “It’s actually thoroughly modern, in
  keeping with an era that values ecology and nature. We’re like a bird building
  its nest: we take only what we need, from nearby. It’s almost political.”
  Guédelon has quarriers, stone cutters, masons, joiners, blacksmiths, tilers,
  painters, carpenters, ropemakers, wheelwrights, carters and basketmakers –
  60-odd artisans in all – building cob and rubblework walls, firing tiles,
  blending dyes and pigments, braiding rope and forging and beating nails,
  hinges and decorative ironwork. The sole concessions to modernity are safety
  boots for everyone, glasses for those cutting stone, and ropes and carabiner
  clips for people working on the castle’s medieval-style timber scaffolding
  (which itself must be health and safety approved). “It sounds trite, but it’s
  ‘back to the future’,” said Emmanuel de Tissot, the newly appointed managing
  director. “We’re on a collective quest, for fidelity, for accuracy. For truth,
  I suppose. Guédelon engages body, heart and mind. Visitors, too.” The typical
  visit here lasts five hours. A rapt crowd listens as Florian Renucci, master
  builder, explains that each beam of the great hall’s roof vaults is a single
  branch hewn from a single tree, respecting the strong “heart” of the wood.
  Guédelon joiners were instrumental in the rebuilding of the fire-damaged Notre
  Dame Cathedral. The Guédelon method, Renucci said, was to study the remains of
  castles and other buildings of the time when Philippe Auguste was king of
  France, to consult scientists, historians, archaeologists and archives – and
  then to proceed by deduction and, most often, trial and error, until a working
  solution was found. This summer, the problem at hand is the main drawbridge.
  “We know – we can see – there were strategically placed openings in castle
  gatehouse walls,” he said. “We know pulleys existed. But that’s it. How did it
  work? In 1250, how exactly were two men able to raise and lower a 400-tonne
  drawbridge?” Sometimes, it can take years. The clay tile oven had to be
  dismantled and rebuilt five times before it worked: there was no intact
  13th-century clay tile oven to copy. When masons failed to devise a waterproof
  mortar for the cistern, they took samples from a castle in the south of France
  and had them analysed in a university lab. And everyone lost sleep trying to
  figure out how to drop the keystone into the chapel roof. “A whole ecosystem
  of archaeological and scientific research and of empirical experimentation has
  evolved around us,” Renucci said, “with so many applications for now, and for
  the future. Restorers come to learn how to make materials you can’t buy any
  more; builders to see nature-friendly techniques that vanished decades ago.”
  Those who work here love it. “I get to make things that will last, with my
  hands,” said Matthis Lacroix, 22, a blacksmith. Simon Malier, 26, a carpenter
  who studied materials engineering, appreciated “the time to get things right,
  the sense that what you’re doing has been done for millennia, the profound
  human knowledge you acquire”. Not all are permanent staff. Brittany Joyner,
  42, an actor and longtime amateur woodworker from Los Angeles, was doing three
  months, between jobs. “What I love is, working by hand teaches you how to
  really read the wood,” she said. “You learn respect for the material. Power
  tools just obliterate all of that.” Some have been here decades. Trimming a
  beam, Nicolas Touchefeu, 44, said this was his 26th year, “because it’s how I
  like to work, with my hands. Simple as that.” Other were staying just days, as
  one of the eight- to 10 volunteers Guédelon takes on each week. “Hard, but so
  satisfying,” was the verdict of Philippe Beghdali, a nurse. In 1999, Martin
  reckoned the castle would be finished “by about 2020”. Now she thinks maybe
  “in five or six years”; the main tower, 30 metres high, still has to be topped
  off, while other elements are still incomplete. In truth, though, the answer
  is never: pretty soon, the north wall, the first to be built, is going to need
  repointing. In the time it has been under construction, said Martin, 50
  Guédelon babies have been born. But time, as the Guardian wrote just over a
  quarter of a century ago, is relative when you’re building a medieval castle
  by hand. “That’s our real luxury,” she said. “We have the time to try, fail,
  try again. And so far, we’ve never not found a solution.”
