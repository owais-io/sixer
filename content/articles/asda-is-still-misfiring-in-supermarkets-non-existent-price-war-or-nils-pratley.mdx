  Five months ago, the talk in supermarket-land was of price wars. A wounded
  Asda, with the corporate hero Allan Leighton back at the helm 25 years after
  leading the last turnaround, was out to restore the chain’s “DNA” as the
  price-setter among the traditional groups. A “pretty significant war chest”
  would be dedicated to the task, he promised. The group’s owners – the private
  equity firm TDR Capital and the remaining Issa brother from the 2021 leveraged
  buyout – were prepared to suffer a “material reduction in our profit” in the
  coming year in order to get the sales line moving again. Even shares in the
  mighty Tesco shuddered in the face of this apparent sudden shift in
  competitive conditions. So how’s this price war going? Well, you’d struggle to
  tell it exists. Tuesday’s scoreboard of market shares from the research group
  Worldpanel, formerly Kantar, told a familiar tale. Tesco and Sainsbury’s, the
  two FTSE 100 firms, enjoyed a red-hot summer. Asda and Morrisons, the duo
  carrying heaps of buyout debt, did not. In Asda’s case, sales were down for
  the 15th month in a row. In a trade where a movement of a single percentage
  point in market share counts as significant, the remarkable statistic is that
  Asda’s slice of the grocery market has declined from 14.8% at the time of the
  buyout to 11.8%. In the old days, Asda used to jostle with Sainsbury’s (15%
  today) to be second to Tesco. Now a still-expanding Aldi is on its heels, with
  10.8%. Over at Morrisons (8.4%), there are more signs of stability, but it is
  still about to be passed by Lidi, on 8.3%. The moral looks simple and
  unsurprising: it is hard to throw punches when you’re loaded up with buyout
  debt and face better-financed rivals. Tesco and Sainsbury’s always have the
  option of dialling down their share buybacks, which are currently chunky, if
  more financial ammunition is required. Meanwhile, the UK operations of Aldi
  and Lidl are part of enormous, privately owned international groups that
  define the long-term in terms of decades, as opposed to private equity’s
  half-decade. To be fair to Leighton, he always said a turnaround at Asda would
  take three to five years, so one shouldn’t write him off. There is still
  plenty he can do, beyond price-cutting, to fix the basics. One suspects he’ll
  stop the bleeding in the sales line soon enough when the benefit of an £800m
  investment in new IT systems kicks in. But the notion that a resurgent Asda
  could seriously imperil the progress of Tesco and Sainsbury’s, which was the
  stock market’s worry in March, always felt fanciful – and still does. The
  point about the 2021 buyout of Asda is that TDR and the Issa brothers used so
  little equity that they could de-risk their investment via various shuffles
  with petrol stations and sale-and-leaseback property transactions. Their
  original gamble is probably a winner even if Asda merely stabilises from here.
  By contrast, sustaining a serious price war might require a fresh injection of
  equity, meaning fresh investment risks for them. If Asda’s owners are up for
  such an adventure, it would be time to rethink. But, as things look today, the
  talk of price wars was phoney and the real bargain was shares in Tesco, which
  dipped to 321p during the wobble in March and are now fully a pound higher.
  The improvement in Sainsbury’s stock is almost as good. Neither would have
  happened if the price war had been real.
