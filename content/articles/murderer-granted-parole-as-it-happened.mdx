  With that, we will wrap the blog for the day. We’ll be back first thing
  tomorrow morning, but until then, here were the biggest headlines: Japan’s
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has beaten a German rival in the race to build
  Australia’s new fleet of warships, with the federal government expecting the
  first to be ready for service by 2030. The metal producer Nyrstar will get a
  $135m bailout from a coalition of the federal government and the governments
  of South Australia and Tasmania, which will support the company’s Port Pirie
  facility in SA. Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward has sought an injunction to
  stop him being expelled from the New South Wales parliament, which will see
  him remain, for now, the state member for Kiama. The Australian Uyghur
  Tangritagh Women’s Association has filed a federal court application to force
  Kmart to supply documents that show how much it knows about the operations of
  two factories in China’s Xinjiang region. James Vlassakis, a convicted
  offender in one of Australia’s most notorious crimes, the Snowtown murders,
  has been granted parole after more than two decades behind bars. A First
  Nations group has applied to halt construction of the main stadium planned for
  the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. The discovery of a father lost in the NT outback
  for a week has been hailed as a “miracle” by his family. Gach Top, 26, has
  been found dehydrated but safe, two days after a major search and rescue
  operation was called off. One man dead, another critically injured after
  workplace incident in Sydney’s Carlingford A man has died after a workplace
  incident in northwest Sydney. About 9am today, emergency services were called
  to Pennant Hills Road in Carlingford after reports of the incident. Officers
  arrived to find two men suffering critical injuries. NSW Ambulance paramedics
  attended the scene and treated the injured men. A 40-year-old man was taken to
  Westmead hospital, while a 30-year-old man was taken to Royal North Shore
  hospital. The 40-year-old has since died from his injuries, while the
  30-year-old remains in hospital in a critical condition. A crime scene has
  been established and the incident is being investigated. It has also been
  referred to SafeWork NSW. Jury selected for trial of Outback Wrangler’s Matt
  Wright A jury has been selected for the trial of reality TV star Matt Wright
  on charges of perverting the course of justice after a fatal outback
  helicopter crash, AAP reports. Wright’s Outback Wrangler TV show co-star and
  mate Chris “Willow” Wilson was killed in the February 2022 crash, which also
  seriously injured pilot Sebastian Robinson. Wilson, 34, was hanging from a
  sling under the chopper on a mission to collect crocodile eggs when the
  aircraft lost power and plunged to the ground. Wright was charged after being
  accused of tampering with evidence to cover up non-adherence to aircraft
  maintenance rules. The 45-year-old has pleaded not guilty to three counts of
  attempting to pervert the course of justice. Wright arrived at the supreme
  court in Darwin on Tuesday, with his wife, Kaia, and lawyers. More than 100
  potential jurors packed the court, with dozens coming forward to seek to be
  excused from jury service, as Wright watched from the dock. A panel of 12
  jurors plus two reserves was selected, comprising eight men and six women.
  Acting Justice Allan Blow told the court the trial could take from three to
  five weeks, with a long list of witnesses to be examined. He told jurors the
  case had received a lot of publicity but it was important they ignore what
  they had heard or read about it and rely solely on evidence presented in the
  courtroom in making their decisions. NSW Police charge more people allegedly
  involved in Sydney fraud and money laundering syndicate Two more people have
  been charged for allegedly being involved in a highly sophisticated fraud and
  money laundering syndicate operating across Sydney. In January last year, an
  investigation was launched into the syndicate, which police alleged was
  targeting Sydney automotive financing companies. But investigations revealed
  the syndicate’s operations extended to large-scale personal, business and home
  loan fraud against multiple financial institutions. Eight people had already
  been charged with offences and remain before the courts. Last Wednesday,
  strike force detectives executed 10 search warrants in Sydney and seized $4.1m
  worth of luxury items including two Bentleys, a Ferrari, a firearm, two
  tasers, body armour and a small quantity of prohibited drugs. At about 11am
  yesterday, a 60-year-old man and a 61-year-old woman were arrested at
  Gladesville Police Station. The man was charged with five counts of
  “dishonestly obtain financial advantage etc by deception and participate
  criminal group contribute criminal activity”. The woman was charged with two
  counts of “dishonestly obtain financial advantage etc by deception and
  participate criminal group contribute criminal activity”. The pair were
  granted conditional bail to appear in Burwood Local court on 29 September,
  where police will allege they committed fraud to the value of about $15.5m.
  Youngest perpetrator convicted in Snowtown serial killings granted parole
  James Vlassakis, a convicted offender in one of Australia’s most notorious
  crimes, the Snowtown murders, has been granted parole after more than two
  decades behind bars. Vlassakis, now 45, was the youngest of the four
  perpetrators involved in South Australia’s so-called “bodies in the barrels”
  serial killings which took place in the 1990s. He confessed in 2001 to four
  murders and became a key witness for the crown against perpetrators John
  Bunting and Robert Wagner, who are serving life sentences without the prospect
  of parole. In 2002, Vlassakis was sentenced to a minimum of 26 years in
  prison. The South Australian Parole Board said there was a 60-day period
  during which the state’s attorney general, the commissioner for victims’
  rights or the police commissioner could appeal. Its chair, Frances Nelson,
  told reporters: We have to look at whether or not he presents a risk to the
  community and in our assessment, he does not. His institutional behaviour has
  been excellent. He was extremely young at the time that he was drawn into
  Bunting’s offending. Tony Burke: recognition of Palestine would afford
  Palestinians some dignity Burke also backed the foreign minister, Penny Wong’s
  sense of “urgency” over the situation in Gaza, as Labor moves closer to
  recognising Palestinian statehood. It’s horrific what people are seeing. And
  I’m sorry that we’re in a debate where every time you … show sympathy [for]
  what is happening to the Palestinian people someone wants to say ‘oh, you’re
  saying the hostages shouldn’t be released?’ Of course, the hostages should be
  released. Of course, Israel should live in peace and security. Of course,
  Hamas can’t be part of the answer here. It’s also true that the starvation
  we’re watching cannot go on. Burke said the federal government had always
  argued for a two-state-solution and “part of that is you get to a point where
  you recognise Palestine as a state, just as we already do Israel”. There’s a
  dignity for the Palestinian people that comes with that. There is a sense –
  you can understand why – the Palestinian people all around the world … would
  feel, in different ways, they’re invisible. And to be able to say, no, you’re
  recognised as a state by these various countries, it is a big signal to those
  individual people. It’s not a signal to Hamas or anyone like that … The
  government in working through this is wanting to make sure that any step taken
  is as meaningful as possible and is the biggest contribution it could possibly
  be towards peace. Tony Burke says he hasn’t seen Palestinian recognition
  linked to violence Burke said many applications for visas were rejected
  because of applicants’ criminal offences, but there had been a surge in people
  pushing Islamophobic or antisemitic views. There have been a
  disproportionately high number of examples recently where we were concerned
  about antisemitism and where we were concerned about Islamophobia. There’s
  other forms of bigotry that are relevant as well, but those two, right now,
  are disproportionately high. Asked if early Palestinian recognition could
  “fuel violence” in Australia, as some Jewish groups have argued, Burke said he
  had “no reason to have that particular concern”. There’s heightened tensions
  and all of that is very real and our security agencies look at that very
  carefully. But I have not seen it [linked] to Palestinian recognition as you
  just described. Burke on visa decisions: ‘we don’t need hatred imported here’
  The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon
  Briefing after revealing that he has blocked dozens of visas to protect social
  cohesion. Asked if he had abandoned free speech principles, Burke said the
  principles he followed “are the ones in the act”. Australians will have
  whatever views they want … if someone has got a record of just trying to blow
  issues up and turn people against each other, we don’t need them here. I’m
  really relaxed about saying to someone who wants to come here, incite discord,
  spread hatred, you can go to another country, we don’t need it here. Burke
  said when he received criticism about preventing freedom of speech, his view
  was “very simple”: We don’t need hatred imported here. If someone wants to
  come on a speaking tour, [and] they’ve got a record of saying horrific things,
  we will look at it. If someone is coming on a visitor visa, you’re a lot more
  relaxed. Generally they’re not going to make public comments. For some time,
  Kanye West came and went in Australia and it was a visitor visa … Then even he
  reached the threshold with that Heil Hitler song. Burke estimated about 100
  visas had been refused during his time in office, including a number made by
  him personally. NSW Police confirm teenager who was fatally stabbed near
  Newcastle was Chinese exchange student A 14-year-old girl that was fatally
  stabbed near Newcastle last night was a Chinese exchange student, NSW police
  have confirmed. At about 10.20pm emergency services were called to a home at
  Edgeworth in Lake Macquarie following reports of a stabbing. Officers found a
  teenage girl with an injury to her torso. She was treated at the scene by
  paramedics before being taken to the John Hunter hospital, where she later
  died. A 13-year-old girl, also a Chinese student, was arrested at the scene
  and remains in police custody. During a search of the home, a kitchen knife
  was located and seized for forensic examination. No charges have been laid.
  The investigation is continuing. NSW introduces bill to tighten checks on
  people working with children The New South Wales government has introduced
  legislation to strengthen Working With Children Checks (WWCC) to better
  protect children from harm. If passed, only the Office of the Children’s
  Guardian – the state’s independent child safety regulator – will be
  responsible for reviewing WWCC decisions, removing external appeal pathways
  through the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT). Currently, people
  with serious criminal histories – including offences involving children – can
  have decisions made by the Office of the Children’s Guardian overturned. In
  some cases, this has allowed individuals who were disqualified to return to
  child-related work. The same change will be made for NDIS worker checks. To
  close system-wide information gaps, the NSW government will also advocate for
  a national register of WWCC at National Cabinet. Acting minister for education
  and early learning, Courtney Houssos, said “families need to know the system
  will catch the people it’s supposed to”. Stronger regulation isn’t just
  overdue – it’s essential. We’re putting safety and accountability back at the
  heart of early education and care. Gas tax boosts economic growth,
  Productivity Commissioning modelling fomds Gas industry taxes grow Australia’s
  economy, according to modelling for the government’s Productivity Commission
  ahead of its economic roundtable. The petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT) was
  the only major federal tax to increase economic incentives for each additional
  dollar it raised, the modelling’s author, Chris Murphy, found. Taxes tend to
  be economically harmful as they decrease incentives to work, invest or
  otherwise stimulate the economy, but Murphy found the PRRT boosted the economy
  at a rate of 9 cents for every extra dollar the tax raises. Critics say the
  40% tax has raised relatively little due to its generous rules allowing
  companies to fully deduct capital expenditure from their tax liability. Bob
  Breunig, a tax expert, has previously told Guardian Australia that the rate
  could be hiked to 50% without a big fall in investment: Taxing profits that
  are well above the firm’s needs “in principle does no economic harm,” though
  taxing normal levels of returns on investment would be harmful, the paper
  said. The commission referenced Murphy’s paper in its July proposal of a big
  company tax cut and an offsetting cashflow tax hike, getting the conversation
  going ahead of the Albanese government’s economic roundtable, two weeks from
  now. The modelling, first reported by the Australian Financial Review, also
  suggested the goods and services tax was the best option for tax hike while
  company tax was ripe for a cut: Per extra dollar of revenue raised, the GST
  does the least economic harm, followed by personal income tax, followed by
  company income tax with the most economic harm. Marles says whole world
  ‘looking with horror’ at Gaza situation Turning to the issue of Palestinian
  statehood, with increasing signs Australia is on the cusp of making an
  announcement, Marles denied reports that the right-wing faction of the Labor
  party – particularly in Victoria – had been resistant to it. “This is not an
  issue of internal factional politics,” he said. What I would say in relation
  to this, to echo the words of the foreign minister today … it has been a
  bipartisan position across Australian politics to support a two-state
  solution. And that’s been the case for decades. Pointed to the fact Labor’s
  “order of things” had changed last year, with Penny Wong saying it didn’t have
  to come at the end of the peace progress, Marles said that reflected a “change
  in circumstances in the Middle East” and the accompanied sense of urgency. I
  think the whole world, really, is looking with horror at what is playing out
  in the Middle East. The humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza, the loss
  of innocent life there, that informs the way countries around the world are
  seeing it. Marles said is a two-state-solution was where “we want to end up,
  the involvement or [rather] the non-involvement of Hamas in any future
  Palestinian government is critically important”, as was the return of the
  hostages. We know that an enduring peace will only be achieved if a two-state
  solution is ultimately realised. And that has been manifestly put on display
  in terms of the tragedy we see unfolding in the Middle East right now. Marles
  says intention is to move production of Mogami-class ships to Western
  Australia as soon as possible Marles said the Mogami-class vessel’s next
  generation is currently in the production line in Japan. … we have slots
  within that production line for the three vessels that will be built in Japan.
  It is then the intention to move the production of these vessels as soon as we
  can, we see that as being after the first three, to Western Australia. Marles
  said building them onshore was contingent on the Henderson defence precinct
  being built but the government was “confident” that would be the case. What
  this will be is the heart of the continuous naval shipbuilding program … The
  focus here is speed to service. Because we need to have a new service
  combatant in the water as quickly as we can. That’s why we’re having the first
  batch, the first three being built overseas. And we do have a sense of
  confidence given there’s an existing production line with these ships being
  built and we have our ships in that slot. Some $55bn has been put aside for
  the surface fleet over the next 10 years, with $10bn allocated to the
  general-purpose frigate. Marles said regional threats, including China, was
  not part of the consideration. The only criteria here was which would be the
  best platform for Australia going forward. We’ve been very clear the
  capability needs to be the fundamental basis upon which we’re making these
  decisions. Marles says navy shipbuilding contract unrelated to Aukus The
  defence minister and deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is appearing on
  ABC’s Afternoon Briefing after Japan beat a German rival to win a $10bn
  contract to grow Australia’s war fleet. Asked if the deal with the first step
  towards bringing Japan into Aukus, Marles said the Mogami class vessel was
  selected “because it’s the best vessel for Australia”, and the US “did not
  provide a view” on the decision. Both the final two bidders, TKMS, that builds
  the vessel in Germany, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, that builds the Mogami
  class, they’re both excellent bids. When we look at the two ships, their cost,
  the way we sustain them over the long term, it’s the best option. Aukus
  obviously is very central to our defence posture and what we’re seeking to do
  in terms of providing a long-range submarine capacity for Australia, as well
  as innovating in other areas of military technology with the US and the UK,
  but this decision is really quite separate. When we came to government, we
  inherited the oldest combat surface fleet the Navy had been operating since
  the second world war … that was a capability gap. The service fleet review
  made it clear we need to meet that capability gap. That’s what the
  general-purpose frigate was about. That’s why we’re moving very quickly in
  relation to this. Teen e-dirt bike rider accused of fatal crash gets bail A
  teenage boy charged with manslaughter after he allegedly collided with a
  pedestrian while he was riding an electric dirt bike has been granted bail
  with strict conditions, AAP reports. Police allege the 17-year-old struck the
  59-year-old woman while riding the e-bike erratically in a public park in
  Perth’s northern suburbs on 26 July. He appeared via video-link in the West
  Australian children’s court on Tuesday, when he was granted bail. His
  conditions of release include not riding any vehicle in public, residing at
  one of his parents’ homes, a 7pm to 7am curfew at the residence unless
  accompanied by a parent, submitting to police checks during those hours and
  surrendering his passport. The prosecution did not oppose bail after a
  favourable bail service report was returned to the court. Police charged the
  boy with manslaughter, driving without a licence and riding an unregistered
  vehicle after the woman died in hospital. He was later also charged with
  reckless driving and failing to stop when ordered, with police alleging that
  five minutes before the woman was struck, an officer on a motorbike tried to
  stop the boy using lights and sirens. The matter will return to the same court
  on 6 October. The discovery of a father who had been lost in the outback for a
  week has been hailed as a “miracle” by his family, AAP reports. Gach Top, 26,
  has been found dehydrated but safe in the Northern Territory, two days after a
  major search and rescue operation was called off. His family never gave up,
  continuing to look for the father before he was eventually located about 45km
  west of Alice Springs on Monday night. Police said he had been taken to
  hospital for assessment. Top disappeared near his hometown of Alice Springs on
  28 July. His car was found at nearby John Flynn’s Grave historical reserve the
  next day, sparking concerns for his welfare. A massive search operation was
  launched, including ATVs, drones and aerial support covering more than 500
  square kilometres of terrain. Police suspended the search on Saturday
  following five days of scouring the area west of Alice Springs. However Top’s
  family members and local volunteers continued to look before the young father
  was reportedly spotted walking barefoot near Jay Creek outstation by the
  Aboriginal homeland’s residents on Monday night. Police said Top was found
  safe near Jay Creek, close to where items of his clothing had been found
  earlier. The president of the NSW Legislative Council, Ben Franklin, has ruled
  that MPs taking photographs in the chamber while parliament is sitting will be
  regarded “as disorderly” and dealt with accordingly. The ruling follows the
  leaking of texts which Mark Latham allegedly sent to his ex-partner showing
  women MPs accompanied by derogatory comments. The texts, though private, have
  caused outrage among MPs, because the photos were taken without the knowledge
  or consent of the women who featured. Franklin said today that there had
  already been rulings by previous presidents that selfies were “completely
  inappropriate”. He said that while phones were permitted in the chamber, it
  was not permitted to use them as recording devices and that this included
  taking photos and videos. The parliament has clear rules for the media when it
  comes to taking photos or filming within the chamber. News photographers are
  restricted to photographing the person who is speaking – but the rules were
  less clear for members of parliament. Coalition welcomes announcement Japan
  will build new Australian navy fleet The Coalition has welcomed today’s news
  that Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been selected to build the Royal
  Australian Navy’s next fleet of warships, with the federal government
  expecting the first to be ready for service by 2030, while continuing to urge
  Labor to drastically boost defence spending. In a joint statement, the acting
  shadow minister for defence, Andrew Hastie, and shadow minister for defence
  industry and personnel Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, said the upgraded
  Mogami-class frigate would play a “critical role in maintaining peace in our
  region and deterring aggression”. The Albanese Labor government must ensure
  that the upgraded Mogami frigates are delivered in a cost-effective and timely
  manner. Australia needs these frigates in the water as soon as possible to
  avoid critical gaps in our capability. Hastie and Price said the decision came
  as Australia faced “the most challenging geopolitical environment since the
  Second World War”. At a time when our allies and partners are all increasing
  defence spending, so too must Australia.The Coalition has reaffirmed its
  support for increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP to meet the demands of
  the Defence Strategic Review. Australia is on track to lift defence spending
  from about $53bn a year, or about 2% of GDP – to an estimated $100bn, or 2.4%
  of GDP, by 2033-34, as the federal government continues to push back on US
  demands for Australia to drastically increase its defence budget to 3.5% of
  GDP. That’s all for me, thanks for sticking with us. The great Caitlin Cassidy

  devalued today It will now take quite a bit more Qantas points to book a
  reward flight. The airline has officially upped the number of points needed
  for a classic reward by up to 20%, with the starting classic fare on a
  short-haul domestic flight moving from 8,000 points up to 9,200. Classic
  upgrade rewards will also increase by up to 20%. It’s the first time Qantas
  has increased the number of points required for a classic reward in six years.
  The airline said the change ”will help ensure we can continue investing in the
  program, maintaining its value for members both now and in the future”.
  Classic flight rewards on Jetstar’s short-haul domestic flights in Australia
  and New Zealand were lowered by 11% You can check out the new reward tables

  there’s some merit to the idea. Melbourne lord mayor Nicholas Reece said there
  is some weight behind an idea the city adopt a calendar that references First
  Nations seasons, rather than the four that have been “superimposed” on the
  city from northern Europe. Reece was speaking on 3AW earlier about the
  Melbourne 2050 Summit at the city’s town hall in May. One of the ideas that
  came out of the summit included the adoption of many seasons referenced in the
  Wurundjeri calendar. Reece told 3AW: In the Wurundjeri calendar, there were
  six seasons. It was a wet summer and a dry summer. A wet winter and a dry
  winter. And when you think about it makes sense. We have gone and superimposed
  the four seasons, essentially from Northern Europe, here in Melbourne, and
  they don’t really match up with the weather patterns. … This is actually quite
  an interesting idea, don’t just rule it out … you’ve gotta think about it. …
  This is one of those things where a bit of First Nations knowledge appears to
  make a bit more sense. Reece went on to say he tracked Melbourne’s wattle
  trees himself, saying their flowering lined up extremely well with the
  Wurundjeri calendar: It’s extraordinary. Literally wattle season starts and
  that week you look around Melbourne and all of the wattle trees have turned
  fluorescent yellow and it’s beautiful. Household spending on non-essentials up
  as cost-of-living pressures ease, ABS data shows Australians have been
  splashing out on new cars, food and electronics as price pressures ease, AAP
  reports. Household spending rose 0.5% in June on top of a 1% increase in May
  as shoppers shelled out for new goods, official figures show. Spending on
  furnishings and household equipment led the charge, growing by 2%, while
  clothing and shoes rose by 1.6% and food increased by 1.5% in Australian
  Bureau of Statistics data released on Tuesday. Australians spent less on
  alcohol and tobacco, health and eating out in June. Compared to same month in
  2024, Australians spent 7.9% more on recreation and culture and 7.5% more on
  food, with household spending overall sitting 4.8% higher. More on the Gareth
  Ward showdown Returning to the potential constitutional showdown with the
  state’s supreme court over parliament’s attempt to expel local MP and
  convicted rapist Gareth Ward. The hearing for the matter has now been brought
  forward by a day to 9.30am Thursday and will be heard by the court of appeal.
  It came after the Minns government sought an earlier hearing in the court to
  lift an ex parte injunction granted the previous day to Ward. It prevented
  parliament from moving to expel the member for Kiama. In a directions hearing
  before Justice Julie Ward, the president of the court of appeal, the lawyer
  acting for Gareth Ward, Peter King, said bringing the hearing forward earlier
  than Thursday could interfere with the King’s mother’s 95th birthday. He also
  noted there was also the challenge of getting instructions from Ward given he
  is remanded in custody in the Hunter Valley. Julie Ward responded: You’re the
  ones that have invoked the jurisdiction of the court. Ordinarily one would not
  expect the matter would be going on for a long time. More on this story here:
  Kmart ‘disappointed’ by federal court application over supply chain Kmart has
  expressed its disappointment at a federal court application that could force
  it to produce documents showing how much it knows about the operations of two
  factories in China’s Xinjiang region. The application by the Australian Uyghur
  Tangritagh Women’s Association, supported by law firm Maurice Blackburn and
  the Human Rights Law Centre, seeks to establish whether Kmart “adequately
  implemented its ethical sourcing procedures regarding these suppliers”. The
  three groups believe “there are credible links between two of its
  factories/suppliers and the use of Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang”. In a
  statement, a Kmart spokesperson said it invited the association to meet it on
  several occasions to better understand their concerns. Kmart has been in
  correspondence with the applicant’s lawyers for over 12 months and has
  provided extensive details of our ethical sourcing program. We take all
  reports of modern slavery risk within our supply chains very seriously. Where
  we learn of an alleged non compliance with our code through an audit, site
  visit or complaint, or by a worker in a supplier’s factory, we take action to
  investigate and remediate the issue, working collaboratively with the
  supplier. Senators behind PwC parliamentary hearings ask finance department to
  maintain ban on consultancy firm Three senators that led parliamentary
  hearings into PwC Australia have written to the finance department, urging it
  to reconsider a decision to lift a ban on the consultancy firm working with
  the federal government. Last month, Guardian Australia revealed the finance
  department had recommended the end of a long-term ban triggered by a scandal
  involving the misuse of confidential Treasury information. The matter is still
  being investigated by the Australian Federal Police and has been referred to
  the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Finance completed a 47-page review
  into the firm and shared it with Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, Greens senator
  Barbara Pocock and Liberal senator Richard Colbeck last month. The completed
  report was due to be published on 25 July. But after receiving a briefing from
  her department, the finance minister Katy Gallagher asked for the views of the
  three senators to be considered before the department’s review was “finalised
  and published”. The letter, seen by Guardian Australia, said “we believe the
  department’s decision is premature and that in line with our recommendations,
  the firm should remain excluded from government contracting, at least until
  all ongoing investigations are complete”. It went on: PwC has been excluded
  from contracting with the Australian government since April last year. In our
  view, there is no meaningful justification for giving them the green light
  after such little time and while significant investigations remain ongoing.
  The finance department and the finance minister were contacted for comment.
  Thousands of Australian students begin global Pisa tests About 20,000
  Australian students are taking part in one of the world’s largest global
  measure of skills. The OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment
  (Pisa) has been conducted every three years since 2000 to evaluate how
  15-year-old students apply knowledge in reading, science, mathematics and
  different “innovative domains”. It is managed in Australia by the Australian
  Council for Educational Research (Acer). The online assessment will run over
  the next six weeks across 92 countries, including Australia. Findings are
  expected to be released in September next year. For the first time this cycle,
  students will take part in a new domain, “Learning in the Digital World”,
  which will ask students to solve algorithmic problems with the help of digital
  tools to assess these emerging skills. Australian science teachers of
  15-year-olds will also be invited to answer questionnaires about how science,
  including environmental literacy, is taught across schools and school systems.
  The most recent results, released in 2023, found Australia’s year 9 students
  had climbed into the top 10 of OECD countries, while continuing a longer-term
  trend of national decline. Search continues along Tasmanian coastline for
  missing plane carrying couple and their dog Emergency officials are continuing
  their search today for a small plane that went missing on Saturday afternoon
  after leaving Tasmania’s George Town airport en route to regional NSW. A
  Tasmania police helicopter will patrol the state’s northern coastline as it
  searches for the twin-seater aircraft, which was carrying a married couple and
  their dog. Rough weather conditions on the water have prevented marine vessels
  from assisting the search today. Nick Clark, an inspector for Tasmania police,
  said in a statement: Inclement weather is limiting our search options, however
  we are continuing our efforts to locate the plane and its occupants and will
  be utilising the helicopter. The plane in question is a two-seat, single
  engine aircraft, and a distinctive bright green in colour. Fog lifts on Sydney
  Harbour after week of rain It’s blue skies in Sydney this afternoon after a
  week of relentless rain, but that wasn’t so earlier this morning when the
  harbour completely disappeared under a thick fog. Dramatic footage captured
  the moment the fog lifted to reveal the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House.
  NSW faces constitutional showdown New South Wales politicians are facing a
  potential constitutional showdown with the state’s supreme court over
  parliament’s attempt to expel local MP and convicted rapist Gareth Ward. The
  Minns government was seeking an urgent hearing in the supreme court on Tuesday
  with a view to lifting an ex parte injunction granted the previous day to
  Ward. It prevented parliament, for now, from moving to expel the member for
  Kiama. Ward commenced the proceedings on Monday night via his lawyers from
  Silverwater jail, where he has been remanded pending sentencing in September.

  the largest survey in the nation’s history into racism at Australian
  universities. The online survey, launching next week, forms part of an ongoing
  Racism@Uni review led by the commission under the directive of the federal
  government. Findings are expected to be delivered in December. The survey will
  ask university students and staff across the country about the prevalence,
  nature and impact of racism on campuses. All current staff and students 18
  years and over at participating Australian universities will be invited to
  take part anonymously via their university email account. The race
  discrimination commissioner, Giridharan Sivaraman, said the survey was a
  “historic and timely opportunity” to reveal how racism manifested in
  university spaces and how it was navigated: Every university student and staff
  member deserves to feel safe in their place of study or work, and this is a
  chance for them to be heard. The findings of the survey will be instrumental
  in informing recommendations to the Australian government and Australia’s
  universities. An interim report delivered by the commission in 2024 found both
  interpersonal and structural racism were pervasive and deeply entrenched in
  Australian universities. The Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Women’s Association
  has filed a federal court application to force Kmart to supply documents that
  show much it knows about the operations of two factories in China’s Xinjiang
  region. The application, supported by law firm Maurice Blackburn and the Human
  Rights Law Centre, will seek to establish whether Kmart “adequately
  implemented its ethical sourcing procedures regarding these suppliers”. In a
  joint statement, the three groups said if the documents showed Kmart had not
  rigorously monitored any use of forced labour in the factories, it may pave
  the way for a legal claim that Kmart engaged in deceiving or misleading
  conduct. The three groups believe “there are credible links between two of its
  factories/suppliers and the use of Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang”. This
  case is the first of its kind in seeking to bring real accountability home to
  Australian retailers in relation to the risk of Uyghur forced labour infecting
  their supply chains. Documents will be sought from Kmart to determine whether
  Kmart engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct about the use of Uyghur
  forced labour. Kmart was contacted for comment. Wilkie welcomes $135m bailout
  for Nystar metal facility Independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie has welcomed
  a joint support package for the metal producer Nystar, warning a knock-on
  effect in the Tasmanian economy would have been “severe” without intervention.
  Nyrstar will get a $135m bailout from a coalition of the federal government
  and the governments of South Australia and Tasmania, which will support the
  company’s Port Pirie facility in SA. Wilkie said today’s announcement was
  “obviously good news”. The zincworks employs hundreds of workers and supports
  numerous contractors and suppliers, all of whom would have been hit hard if
  the plant had shut down. The knock-on effect in the Hobart and broader
  Tasmanian economy would have been severe. The survival of the zinc works … is
  also central to Australia’s economic future and national security. Now, more
  than ever, Australia needs to focus on maintaining and building on the
  country’s processing and manufacturing capacity, and also to develop more
  robust supply chains. When it comes to critical minerals and rare earth
  minerals in particular, Australia is remarkably well positioned to be a
  globally important supplier. Walkie said he had been in regular contact with
  Nystar and the industry minister, Senator Tim Ayres, and was “confident” the
  federal government well understood the situation. More than 5,800 charges have
  been laid under Queensland’s ‘adult crime, adult time’ legislation. The
  director general, Sarah Cruikshank, revealed in state parliamentary estimates
  that about 1,250 children have been charged under the making Queensland safer
  bills, which passed in December and in May. About 85% of the charges laid
  under the legislation were of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, entering
  premises and burglary, in that order, she said, representing more than 30% of
  the cases going through the children’s court. The attorney general, Deb
  Frecklington, told estimates “nearly half of all juveniles sentenced for an
  adult crime … are now spending time remanded in custody before their case is
  finalised”. We are starting to see more young people sentenced to more
  intensive sentences, detention and probation, with a corresponding drop in
  less intensive sentences, like good behaviour orders and community service
  orders. The laws violate the rights of children including their right to be
  free from “protection from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”,
  discriminate against them, and will disproportionately affect Indigenous
  Queenslanders. More on MP Gareth Ward More on convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward
  seeking an injunction to stop him being expelled from the New South Wales
  parliament, and which will see him remain, for now, the state member for
  Kiama. The New South Wales supreme court confirmed on Tuesday morning that
  Ward had launched proceedings against Labor MP and leader of the house, Ron
  Hoenig. The common law duty judge, Justice Deborah Sweeney, made an order that
  Hoenig be restrained from taking “any steps to expel or otherwise resolve to
  expel” up to and including Friday at 10am. This is when a one-hour hearing for
  the matter is currently set. A five-minute directions hearing is planned for
  tomorrow. 1800 Lasagne, a Melbourne dining darling, has entered into voluntary
  administration. The restaurant said it was working closely with an
  administration team to “streamline and restructure our model to ensure we take
  the best steps while moving forward”, saying: Our loyal suppliers and our
  beloved staff are and will continue to be our highest priority through this
  process. 1800 Lasagne has always been about people, passion and plates of love
  – and that hasn’t changed. We’re grateful for the support of our incredible
  community and encourage everyone to keep showing love and support to local
  hospitality. Police investigating fatal stabbing of teenage girl in Lake
  Macquarie NSW police have established a strike force after the fatal stabbing
  of a teenage girl in Lake Macquarie last night. Officers responded to reports
  of a stabbing about 10.20pm last night, and on arrival emergency services
  found the teen with an injury to her torso. She was treated at the scene by
  paramedics and taken to a local hospital, but was pronounced dead later that
  night. She is believed to be 14, but has not been formally identified. Another
  girl, 13, was arrested at the scene and remains in police custody. Police said
  the pair were known to each other. Officials said a kitchen knife was located
  during a search of the home and has been seized for forensic analysis. No
  charges have been laid. Aussie editor to lead new rightwing tabloid in
  California In case you missed it in our story today about Rupert Murdoch’s
  News Corp launching a Californian, rightwing tabloid next year – the new boss
  will be an Aussie import (presumably without the tariffs). Nick Papps, weekend
  editor of Melbourne’s Herald Sun and a man with a long history with the
  company, will be the editor-in-chief of the California Post, a version of the
  company’s New York Post. It comes as Murdoch’s relationship with US president
  Donald Trump has hit some wobbles. News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said: Los
  Angeles and California surely need a daily dose of The Post as an antidote to
  the jaundiced, jaded journalism that has sadly proliferated. The metal
  producer Nyrstar will get a $135m bailout from a coalition of the federal
  government and the governments of South Australia and Tasmania, which will
  support the company’s Port Pirie facility in SA. Nyrstar said in June its lead
  smelter in Port Pirie was losing tens of millions of dollars a month, saying
  the future of its zinc smelter in Hobart was linked to the success of the one
  in SA. It called on urgent government intervention, the ABC reported at the
  time. The federal government will kick in $57.5m, South Australia $55m and
  Tasmania $22.5m, the SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, said in a news conference:
  This $55 million contribution from the South Australian government is part of
  a $135 million package that’s all about setting up Port Pirie for a more
  prosperous future. We know there is a journey in front of us to be able to
  tackle the challenges we see, particularly coming out of China. But we should
  be upfront and honest about them. First Nations group applies to halt Olympic
  stadium development A First Nations’ group has made a bid to halt development
  of an Olympic stadium in inner-city Brisbane. Victoria Park is slated to play
  host to both the 2032 opening and closing ceremonies, at a brand-new 63,000
  seat stadium, among other venues. The state government recently passed
  legislation overruling a swathe of state laws to get around a mooted legal
  challenge, including heritage, planning and environment acts. The Yagara
  Magandjin Aboriginal Corporation and advocacy group Save Victoria Park made an
  application under section 10 of the federal Aboriginal and Torres Strait
  Islander Heritage Protection Act, which allows the commonwealth to declare
  long-term protection of a significant Aboriginal area. The Queensland premier,
  David Crisafulli, ruled out a stadium in the park during last years’ state
  election. YMAC spokesperson and Yagarabul elder Gaja Kerry Charlton said: We
  know this is a place of great significance and history, not only for Yagara
  people, but for other First Nations and non-Aboriginal people as well. It was
  a complete shock when the premier came out with his stadium plans. He said the
  park would be protected from stadiums; I thought the park was safe. Now the
  government wants to destroy it. We are very concerned there are ancient trees,
  artefacts and very important ecosystems existing there. There may be ancestral
  remains. An updated on SES rescues during flooding in NSW the last few days
  The NSW State Emergency Service received more than 4,300 calls and responded
  to more than 2,300 incidents over the last few days amid intense rainfall
  across parts of the state. That included 34 flood rescues. Parts of low-lying
  areas in Gunnedah remain under evacuation orders, and the SES is moving assets
  to some areas near Wee Waa and Narrabri in anticipation of possible river
  rises as flood waters move downstream. But flooding is easing in the Hunter.
  Still, more than 40 warnings are still in place across the mid-north coast,
  the upper Hunter and New England regions. You can see how those affect your
  area at the Hazard Watch site. NBN picks Amazon’s Kuiper to replace satellite
  service The 300,000 homes in regional and remote parts of Australia that were
  only able to access the NBN via the ageing Skymuster satellites will be able
  to upgrade to low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite services beginning mid-2026
  under a deal signed between NBN Co and Amazon. Despite hundreds of thousands
  of Australians already switching to Elon Musk’s Starlink, Amazon won out the
  deal to provide LEO services to the 300,000 homes covered by the Skymuster
  satellites that will be decommissioned in 2030, following a request for
  proposal process. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but NBN chief
  executive Ellie Sweeney said the agreement would be funded by NBN Co rather
  than needing a cash injection from taxpayers. The services will begin to come
  online mid-2026, starting in Tasmania, as Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellites
  begin to cover Australia. Full coverage should take weeks, the company said.
  NBN Co will begin consultation with communities and retail service providers
  in the coming weeks on product offerings, speed tiers, wholesale pricing and
  the upgrade process required for those on the existing satellite service.
  Users on Starlink today pay a premium for the service compared with NBN
  pricing, and Sweeney said equity would be an important feature in the pricing
  so someone in regional Australia has the same level of service as someone in
  metropolitan areas. Sweeney said: It’s now time to evolve, with full fibre in
  many areas, in upgraded fixed wireless in others and now with LEO satellites,
  we’re committed to ending buffering in the bush. Queensland government
  releases second damning report into state DNA lab Queensland’s state
  government has released more information about the work of its public DNA
  laboratory. Yesterday’s review by forensic scientist Prof Kirsty Wright found
  that virtually all forensic science work done at the laboratory was being done
  late, typically by hundreds of days. A second review, by FBI expert Dr Bruce
  Budowle, found the service remains “in a state of sustained crisis”. He found
  that scientific methods had been implemented “without proper validation”,
  risking the “integrity” of the results, but others not adopted due to
  “perceived or real challenges” which could have been overcome. Budowle said:
  The workplace culture at FSQ appeared to the Review Team to be quite toxic. A
  pair of commissions of inquiry in 2022 and 2023 uncovered systematic errors
  within the laboratory – including an error which called into question DNA
  evidence used in thousands of criminal cases, including for crimes such as
  rape and murder. Wright found the same error had been repeated again last
  year. She recommended contracting out most of the work done by the lab to
  outside laboratories while it undertakes reform. Motion to be moved by NSW
  Labor MPs condemns ‘ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians from Gaza’ Guardia
  Australia has obtained a copy of the motion NSW Labor MPs are planning to move
  in a party meeting today condemning conditions in Gaza and endorsing the right
  to protest. The motion, to be moved by upper house member Sarah Kaine and
  seconded by MP Lynda Voltz, moves that the caucus: Condemns the destruction of
  Gaza, the mass civilian deaths and the Israeli government’s open endorsement
  of the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians from Gaza. Condemns all crimes
  against humanity, including genocide, the murder of civilians and the hostage
  taking. Thanks the people of Sydney for the mass protest rally conducted
  peacefully on Sunday. Endorses the right to protest Requests the attorney
  general to report back to caucus with an options paper for the development of
  a Human Rights Act in this term of the parliament, which we note the attorney
  has already said he supports. My colleague Anne Davies had more on this story
  yesterday: Police divers aiding search for woman swept away in NSW floods
  Police divers are joining the search for a woman swept away by flood waters on
  Saturday near Cessnock in NSW. Rescuers have been searching for the
  26-year-old woman for days after responding to reports a car was trapped in a
  flood in the town of Rothbury. Officers said the driver of the car, a Mini
  Countryman, attempted to travel through flood waters before becoming stuck.
  The driver, a 27-year-old woman, was rescued, but the passenger was swept
  away. The missing woman is a Chinese national who was working as an engineer
  in Australia, where she has lived for three years. NSW opposition supports
  Ward’s expulsion Mark Speakman, leader of the NSW opposition, said he will
  support the government in seeking Gareth Ward’s expulsion. Speakman said: The
  opposition will support Gareth Ward’s expulsion and work with the government
  to get this done as quickly as possible. However, Mr Ward’s legal team should
  do whatever it takes to get a clear message to him – immediately resign. Every
  day he clings to his seat from a jail cell, taxpayers are footing the bill and
  the people of Kiama are left voiceless. It’s not just wrong, it’s offensive.
  Ward’s conviction has thrown the NSW parliament into uncharted territory. As
  an independent he has not had the usual pressure to resign. He remains
  eligible to sit in parliament until all appeals are exhausted. However, the
  parliament has power to expel him if his conduct would damage the integrity of
  the parliament and endanger its proper functioning. The government had planned
  to begin moves to expel him today with a vote expected Wednesday. Convicted
  rapist MP Gareth Ward has sought an injunction to stop him being expelled from
  the New South Wales parliament, which will see him remain, for now, the state
  member for Kiama. Ward has commenced the proceedings via his lawyers from
  Silverwater jail where he has been remanded pending sentence in the criminal
  proceedings in September. He has said he will appeal against his conviction on
  three counts of indecent assault and one for sexual intercourse without
  consent. The premier, Chris Minns, said on 2GB on Tuesday that Ward’s lawyers
  had sought the interim injunction overnight against the leader of the lower
  house, Ron Hoenig, and speaker, Greg Piper, which prevented the parliament
  moving a suspension order until the court can deal with the application. The
  government has sought an urgent supreme court hearing later in the week. Minns
  told 2GB: We’ve got a week of parliament to sit, and I think that most people
  would appreciate, it’s an unconscionable situation to have someone who’s
  currently sitting in jail in Silverwater, convicted of serious sexual
  offences, who is demanding to remain a member of parliament and continue to be
  paid. Melbourne Demons sack coach Simon Goodwin Simon Goodwin, Melbourne’s
  only AFL premiership coach in the past 60 years, has been sacked by the
  Demons, AAP reports. The former Adelaide champion, who led the club to its
  drought-breaking 2021 flag, has been let go by the Demons after just seven
  wins this season. Taking over from Paul Roos in a succession plan for the 2017
  season, Goodwin led Melbourne to their first premiership in 57 years. But
  off-field turmoil and dwindling performances on the field placed the
  48-year-old’s job in jeopardy. My colleague Jack Snape has more on this story
  here: All Sydney ferries back up and running after heavy fog All ferries in
  Sydney have resumed services after they were halted amid heavy fog. Here are
  some photos from the Kirribilli wharf this morning, with the Sydney Opera
  House in the distance. Here’s some video footage of Sydney Harbour this
  morning The defence minister, Richard Marles, will announce this morning that
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will build the Royal Australian Navy’s new $10bn
  frigate fleet. The Japanese company beat out Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine
  Systems for the deal. Marles and the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy,
  will make the announcement just before 9am this morning. The national security
  committee of cabinet made the decision last night, choosing the Japanese-built
  Mogami frigate. The first three frigates will be built overseas before being
  brought to Australia by 2029. The rest are expected to be built at the
  Henderson shipyards in Perth. The new general purpose warships are designed to
  replace the ageing Anzac-class frigates, as they are retired from service by
  the navy. So, just how big was the march on the Sydney Harbour Bridge? The
  number of people who joined a pro-Palestine march across Sydney Harbour Bridge
  on Sunday exceeded everyone’s expectations. But just how many braved the rainy
  weather to urge the Australian government to do more to pressure Israel to
  stop the death and destruction in Gaza? That’s been a sticking point. New
  South Wales police said initial estimates put the crowd at 90,000. A
  spokesperson for rally organisers, the Palestine Action Group, said police had
  informed them 100,000 people were in attendance – but the group estimated the
  figure was closer to 300,000. What does an independent expert have to say?
  Sydney wakes up to a shroud of fog Some pictures of the fog that blanketed
  Sydney this morning: Shadow attorney general says recognising Palestinian
  statehood would send ‘bad signal’ The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser,
  said the recognition of a Palestinian state by Australia would reward Hamas
  and send a “bad signal around the world”. Leeser spoke to RN Breakfast this
  morning, saying while he wants to see a two-state solution, he believes the
  world is “further away from that today than at any point in the past”. Lesser
  said: I don’t want to see people suffering. I want to see the aid getting
  through and I want to see Hamas releasing the hostages because it’s only when
  the hostages are released and only when Hamas plays no further part in the
  future of the region that a stable and lasting peace in the Middle East can
  come about. … I think [recognising a Palestinian state] will send a bad signal
  around the world to other terrorist organisations that if you increase your
  level of intransigence, if you maintain your position, then you will achieve
  your aims … Let me be very clear, I want to see a two-state solution for
  Israel and Palestine. It’s something I’ve believed in for decades. But we seem
  to be further away from that today than at any point in the past, and that is
  largely because of the role that Hamas is playing in Gaza. Anthony Albanese
  spoke to Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, in a phone
  call overnight. The prime minister reiterated Australia’s call for the
  immediate entry of aid into Gaza, a permanent ceasefire, and the release of
  all Israeli hostages still held by terror group Hamas, according to a readout
  of the call circulated by the PM’s office. Albanese also reinforced
  Australia’s commitment to a two state solution, which he said was crucial to a
  just and lasting peace in the Middle East. President Abbas thanked Albanese
  for Australia’s economic and humanitarian support. Australia pledged another
  $20m to aid in Gaza over the weekend. The two leaders also spoke about
  deepening cooperation on several areas. They also agreed to meet on the
  sidelines of the UN general assembly, to be held in New York City in
  September. This is the forum where several major nations are expected to
  pledge to recognise a Palestinian state – a move Albanese’s government is
  under pressure to replicate. Wong says there is a risk ‘there will be no
  Palestine left to recognise’ The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said
  Sunday’s march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge reflected the “distress of
  Australians on what we are seeing unfolding in Gaza”. Asked on RN Breakfast
  this morning whether the march had accelerated any government plans to
  recognise Palestinian statehood, Wong said: In relation to recognition, I’ve
  said for over a year now it’s a matter of when, not if. I would say … there is
  a risk there will be no Palestine left to recognise if the international
  community don’t move to create that pathway to a two-state solution. Wong
  would not comment on further sanctions on Israel, saying Australia’s
  preference remained moving with other countries on such matters so they have
  “more effect”. It has been my long-held position that there will be no peace
  and security, for the people of Israel, unless we resolve to a Palestinian
  state. That has been my view for decades. The Waratah super battery, a massive
  project meant to bolster the energy grid in New South Wales, is now partially
  online. The battery project at Colongra, south of Lake Macquarie, is meant to
  be a “shock absorber” for customers across the Hunter, Sydney and the
  Illawarra, allowing transmission lines in the region to run at greater
  capacity and serving as a backup in case of a power line outage due to an
  event like a lightning strike or a bushfire. The battery system, when fully
  operational, will be the most powerful in Australia and one of the biggest in
  the world. The first 350 megawatts of the 850MW project is now in operation at
  the site of the former Munmorah coal-fired power station. Hannah McCaughey,
  the chief of EnergyCo NSW, said: Switching on the Waratah Super Battery
  Project is a win for our grid and a win for households and businesses across
  NSW … It’s a fantastic example of how new technologies bring new solutions for
  our energy needs. Good morning Nick Visser here to take over for Martin
  Farrer. Let’s get to it. The latest information is that some ferries have
  resumed as the fog lifts. The ferry operator says: Ferries east of the Harbour
  Bridge now operating after earlier heavy fog. F3 and F4 ferries are still
  affected by the fog, with some cancelled between Rydalmere &amp; Circular Quay
  and between Olympic Park &amp; Barangaroo. No Sydney ferries are running at
  the moment due to the heavy fog, according to an advisory from the NSW
  transport department. They say: Make alternative arrangements or consider
  catching a bus instead. Also, listen to announcements &amp; check info
  displays for updates. At this stage there is no forecast when ferry services
  will resume. Palestine Action Group plans more nationwide protests to build on
  ‘massive momentum’ Palestine Action Group organiser Josh Lees says the group
  is planning protests in Sydney and other cities following the Sydney Harbour
  Bridge march on Sunday, Australian Associated Press reports. “We want to build
  on this massive momentum we have now,” he told reporters yesterday with
  protests planned for Sunday 24 August. Despite concerns of regular marches
  across the bridge, Lees said the group has no plans for a repeat crossing any
  time soon and accused the NSW premier, Chris Minns, of having an anti-protest
  agenda. Lees said: His stance is pretty clear and he’s passed a raft of
  anti-protest legislation already. We’re going to have to keep fighting for our
  rights to demonstrate. Penny Wong was asked if the prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, planned to use “the threat of recognition” of a Palestinian state as
  “a point of leverage” as the UK has, in his forthcoming call with his Israeli
  counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu. She declined to say, answering: “You would
  anticipate that the prime minister in his international interactions, just
  reflects the position we articulate as an Australian government, as do I.” She
  pointed to Australia’s sanctions on “extremist settlers and … entities that
  are associated with that”, and said: We want to do what we can to preserve the
  possibility of a Palestinian state … Australia believes that’s the only way to
  assure peace and security for Israelis and for Palestinians. Asked what steps
  the government was taking ahead of a September UN conference where Palestinian
  recognition will lead the agenda, Wong said there was “a lot of coordination
  and discussion with other parties and other countries”. I think we all
  recognise this might be, I think someone said, ‘our last hope’… we cannot
  stand by with what is happening in Gaza and not add momentum towards two
  states. We cannot stand by whilst the prospect of a Palestinian state is
  diminished on the ground by settlements and other statements … As I keep
  saying, I cannot see long-term stability and peace for Israelis and
  Palestinians unless the Palestinian issue is resolved: the issue of the
  Palestinian state. That was the promise that the international community made
  when we established, as a collective, the state of Israel. Australia’s foreign
  affairs minister was asked on the ABC’s 7.30 last night if Sunday’s march for
  Gaza on the Sydney Harbour Bridge would directly impact government policy.
  “That was an extraordinary march and I think it demonstrates what we all
  feel,” Wong answered. I know that Australians are feeling distressed, angry,
  upset, really horrified by what they’re seeing in Gaza. I certainly share that
  distress. So do ministers in the government. The program’s host, Sarah
  Ferguson, pushed her: “If it wasn’t Israel, would the world’s response be
  tougher?” Wong referred back to the government’s announcement yesterday of a
  further $20m in aid. “Even the US has made its position on [the stopping of
  aid] very clear … they are probably the strongest ally of Israel.” She
  described ongoing deaths from starvation in the Palestinian territory as
  “horrific”. “As the prime minister said, it can’t be justified. It can’t be
  defended.” Still, Wong did defend Australia’s response, saying: We’re not the
  central player. But what we have done is worked with others in the
  international community to press for, to call for aid and humanitarian support
  to be delivered safely, and at scale. I think you have seen quite a lot, a
  great deal of pressure being applied to the Israelis on that front, both
  publicly and beyond. Wong refused to say directly whether Israel was “using
  starvation as a weapon of war”, replying: “I think it is impossible to justify
  the withholding of aid from civilians.” Good morning and welcome to our live
  news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories, and then it’ll be
  Nick Visser to take the controls. Penny Wong has called the Sydney Harbour
  Bridge pro-Palestine march as “extraordinary” but defended the government’s
  refusal to follow the UK, France and Canada in taking steps towards
  recognising Palestinian statehood. We have details of what she said on 7.30
  last night coming up. Wong’s comments came as pro-Palestine groups said they
  wanted to build on the success of the Sydney protest. Further protests are
  planned on Sunday 24 August in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth
  with hopes more can be organised in other cities. More coming up. Plus –
  Sydney has woken up to a foggy morning, which means (for now) the ferries
  aren’t running.

With that, we will wrap the blog for the day. We’ll be back first thing tomorrow morning, but until then, here were the biggest headlines: Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has beaten a German rival in the race to build Australia’s new fleet of warships, with the federal government expecting the first to be ready for service by 2030. The metal producer Nyrstar will get a $135m bailout from a coalition of the federal government and the governments of South Australia and Tasmania, which will support the company’s Port Pirie facility in SA. Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward has sought an injunction to stop him being expelled from the New South Wales parliament, which will see him remain, for now, the state member for Kiama. The Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Women’s Association has filed a federal court application to force Kmart to supply documents that show how much it knows about the operations of two factories in China’s Xinjiang region. James Vlassakis, a convicted offender in one of Australia’s most notorious crimes, the Snowtown murders, has been granted parole after more than two decades behind bars. A First Nations group has applied to halt construction of the main stadium planned for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. The discovery of a father lost in the NT outback for a week has been hailed as a “miracle” by his family. Gach Top, 26, has been found dehydrated but safe, two days after a major search and rescue operation was called off. One man dead, another critically injured after workplace incident in Sydney’s Carlingford A man has died after a workplace incident in northwest Sydney. About 9am today, emergency services were called to Pennant Hills Road in Carlingford after reports of the incident. Officers arrived to find two men suffering critical injuries. NSW Ambulance paramedics attended the scene and treated the injured men. A 40-year-old man was taken to Westmead hospital, while a 30-year-old man was taken to Royal North Shore hospital. The 40-year-old has since died from his injuries, while the 30-year-old remains in hospital in a critical condition. A crime scene has been established and the incident is being investigated. It has also been referred to SafeWork NSW. Jury selected for trial of Outback Wrangler’s Matt Wright A jury has been selected for the trial of reality TV star Matt Wright on charges of perverting the course of justice after a fatal outback helicopter crash, AAP reports. Wright’s Outback Wrangler TV show co-star and mate Chris “Willow” Wilson was killed in the February 2022 crash, which also seriously injured pilot Sebastian Robinson. Wilson, 34, was hanging from a sling under the chopper on a mission to collect crocodile eggs when the aircraft lost power and plunged to the ground. Wright was charged after being accused of tampering with evidence to cover up non-adherence to aircraft maintenance rules. The 45-year-old has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Wright arrived at the supreme court in Darwin on Tuesday, with his wife, Kaia, and lawyers. More than 100 potential jurors packed the court, with dozens coming forward to seek to be excused from jury service, as Wright watched from the dock. A panel of 12 jurors plus two reserves was selected, comprising eight men and six women. Acting Justice Allan Blow told the court the trial could take from three to five weeks, with a long list of witnesses to be examined. He told jurors the case had received a lot of publicity but it was important they ignore what they had heard or read about it and rely solely on evidence presented in the courtroom in making their decisions. NSW Police charge more people allegedly involved in Sydney fraud and money laundering syndicate Two more people have been charged for allegedly being involved in a highly sophisticated fraud and money laundering syndicate operating across Sydney. In January last year, an investigation was launched into the syndicate, which police alleged was targeting Sydney automotive financing companies. But investigations revealed the syndicate’s operations extended to large-scale personal, business and home loan fraud against multiple financial institutions. Eight people had already been charged with offences and remain before the courts. Last Wednesday, strike force detectives executed 10 search warrants in Sydney and seized $4.1m worth of luxury items including two Bentleys, a Ferrari, a firearm, two tasers, body armour and a small quantity of prohibited drugs. At about 11am yesterday, a 60-year-old man and a 61-year-old woman were arrested at Gladesville Police Station. The man was charged with five counts of “dishonestly obtain financial advantage etc by deception and participate criminal group contribute criminal activity”. The woman was charged with two counts of “dishonestly obtain financial advantage etc by deception and participate criminal group contribute criminal activity”. The pair were granted conditional bail to appear in Burwood Local court on 29 September, where police will allege they committed fraud to the value of about $15.5m. Youngest perpetrator convicted in Snowtown serial killings granted parole James Vlassakis, a convicted offender in one of Australia’s most notorious crimes, the Snowtown murders, has been granted parole after more than two decades behind bars. Vlassakis, now 45, was the youngest of the four perpetrators involved in South Australia’s so-called “bodies in the barrels” serial killings which took place in the 1990s. He confessed in 2001 to four murders and became a key witness for the crown against perpetrators John Bunting and Robert Wagner, who are serving life sentences without the prospect of parole. In 2002, Vlassakis was sentenced to a minimum of 26 years in prison. The South Australian Parole Board said there was a 60-day period during which the state’s attorney general, the commissioner for victims’ rights or the police commissioner could appeal. Its chair, Frances Nelson, told reporters: We have to look at whether or not he presents a risk to the community and in our assessment, he does not. His institutional behaviour has been excellent. He was extremely young at the time that he was drawn into Bunting’s offending. Tony Burke: recognition of Palestine would afford Palestinians some dignity Burke also backed the foreign minister, Penny Wong’s sense of “urgency” over the situation in Gaza, as Labor moves closer to recognising Palestinian statehood. It’s horrific what people are seeing. And I’m sorry that we’re in a debate where every time you … show sympathy [for] what is happening to the Palestinian people someone wants to say ‘oh, you’re saying the hostages shouldn’t be released?’ Of course, the hostages should be released. Of course, Israel should live in peace and security. Of course, Hamas can’t be part of the answer here. It’s also true that the starvation we’re watching cannot go on. Burke said the federal government had always argued for a two-state-solution and “part of that is you get to a point where you recognise Palestine as a state, just as we already do Israel”. There’s a dignity for the Palestinian people that comes with that. There is a sense – you can understand why – the Palestinian people all around the world … would feel, in different ways, they’re invisible. And to be able to say, no, you’re recognised as a state by these various countries, it is a big signal to those individual people. It’s not a signal to Hamas or anyone like that … The government in working through this is wanting to make sure that any step taken is as meaningful as possible and is the biggest contribution it could possibly be towards peace. Tony Burke says he hasn’t seen Palestinian recognition linked to violence Burke said many applications for visas were rejected because of applicants’ criminal offences, but there had been a surge in people pushing Islamophobic or antisemitic views. There have been a disproportionately high number of examples recently where we were concerned about antisemitism and where we were concerned about Islamophobia. There’s other forms of bigotry that are relevant as well, but those two, right now, are disproportionately high. Asked if early Palestinian recognition could “fuel violence” in Australia, as some Jewish groups have argued, Burke said he had “no reason to have that particular concern”. There’s heightened tensions and all of that is very real and our security agencies look at that very carefully. But I have not seen it [linked] to Palestinian recognition as you just described. Burke on visa decisions: ‘we don’t need hatred imported here’ The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing after revealing that he has blocked dozens of visas to protect social cohesion. Asked if he had abandoned free speech principles, Burke said the principles he followed “are the ones in the act”. Australians will have whatever views they want … if someone has got a record of just trying to blow issues up and turn people against each other, we don’t need them here. I’m really relaxed about saying to someone who wants to come here, incite discord, spread hatred, you can go to another country, we don’t need it here. Burke said when he received criticism about preventing freedom of speech, his view was “very simple”: We don’t need hatred imported here. If someone wants to come on a speaking tour, [and] they’ve got a record of saying horrific things, we will look at it. If someone is coming on a visitor visa, you’re a lot more relaxed. Generally they’re not going to make public comments. For some time, Kanye West came and went in Australia and it was a visitor visa … Then even he reached the threshold with that Heil Hitler song. Burke estimated about 100 visas had been refused during his time in office, including a number made by him personally. NSW Police confirm teenager who was fatally stabbed near Newcastle was Chinese exchange student A 14-year-old girl that was fatally stabbed near Newcastle last night was a Chinese exchange student, NSW police have confirmed. At about 10.20pm emergency services were called to a home at Edgeworth in Lake Macquarie following reports of a stabbing. Officers found a teenage girl with an injury to her torso. She was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to the John Hunter hospital, where she later died. A 13-year-old girl, also a Chinese student, was arrested at the scene and remains in police custody. During a search of the home, a kitchen knife was located and seized for forensic examination. No charges have been laid. The investigation is continuing. NSW introduces bill to tighten checks on people working with children The New South Wales government has introduced legislation to strengthen Working With Children Checks (WWCC) to better protect children from harm. If passed, only the Office of the Children’s Guardian – the state’s independent child safety regulator – will be responsible for reviewing WWCC decisions, removing external appeal pathways through the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT). Currently, people with serious criminal histories – including offences involving children – can have decisions made by the Office of the Children’s Guardian overturned. In some cases, this has allowed individuals who were disqualified to return to child-related work. The same change will be made for NDIS worker checks. To close system-wide information gaps, the NSW government will also advocate for a national register of WWCC at National Cabinet. Acting minister for education and early learning, Courtney Houssos, said “families need to know the system will catch the people it’s supposed to”. Stronger regulation isn’t just overdue – it’s essential. We’re putting safety and accountability back at the heart of early education and care. Gas tax boosts economic growth, Productivity Commissioning modelling fomds Gas industry taxes grow Australia’s economy, according to modelling for the government’s Productivity Commission ahead of its economic roundtable. The petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT) was the only major federal tax to increase economic incentives for each additional dollar it raised, the modelling’s author, Chris Murphy, found. Taxes tend to be economically harmful as they decrease incentives to work, invest or otherwise stimulate the economy, but Murphy found the PRRT boosted the economy at a rate of 9 cents for every extra dollar the tax raises. Critics say the 40% tax has raised relatively little due to its generous rules allowing companies to fully deduct capital expenditure from their tax liability. Bob Breunig, a tax expert, has previously told Guardian Australia that the rate could be hiked to 50% without a big fall in investment: Taxing profits that are well above the firm’s needs “in principle does no economic harm,” though taxing normal levels of returns on investment would be harmful, the paper said. The commission referenced Murphy’s paper in its July proposal of a big company tax cut and an offsetting cashflow tax hike, getting the conversation going ahead of the Albanese government’s economic roundtable, two weeks from now. The modelling, first reported by the Australian Financial Review, also suggested the goods and services tax was the best option for tax hike while company tax was ripe for a cut: Per extra dollar of revenue raised, the GST does the least economic harm, followed by personal income tax, followed by company income tax with the most economic harm. Marles says whole world ‘looking with horror’ at Gaza situation Turning to the issue of Palestinian statehood, with increasing signs Australia is on the cusp of making an announcement, Marles denied reports that the right-wing faction of the Labor party – particularly in Victoria – had been resistant to it. “This is not an issue of internal factional politics,” he said. What I would say in relation to this, to echo the words of the foreign minister today … it has been a bipartisan position across Australian politics to support a two-state solution. And that’s been the case for decades. Pointed to the fact Labor’s “order of things” had changed last year, with Penny Wong saying it didn’t have to come at the end of the peace progress, Marles said that reflected a “change in circumstances in the Middle East” and the accompanied sense of urgency. I think the whole world, really, is looking with horror at what is playing out in the Middle East. The humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza, the loss of innocent life there, that informs the way countries around the world are seeing it. Marles said is a two-state-solution was where “we want to end up, the involvement or [rather] the non-involvement of Hamas in any future Palestinian government is critically important”, as was the return of the hostages. We know that an enduring peace will only be achieved if a two-state solution is ultimately realised. And that has been manifestly put on display in terms of the tragedy we see unfolding in the Middle East right now. Marles says intention is to move production of Mogami-class ships to Western Australia as soon as possible Marles said the Mogami-class vessel’s next generation is currently in the production line in Japan. … we have slots within that production line for the three vessels that will be built in Japan. It is then the intention to move the production of these vessels as soon as we can, we see that as being after the first three, to Western Australia. Marles said building them onshore was contingent on the Henderson defence precinct being built but the government was “confident” that would be the case. What this will be is the heart of the continuous naval shipbuilding program … The focus here is speed to service. Because we need to have a new service combatant in the water as quickly as we can. That’s why we’re having the first batch, the first three being built overseas. And we do have a sense of confidence given there’s an existing production line with these ships being built and we have our ships in that slot. Some $55bn has been put aside for the surface fleet over the next 10 years, with $10bn allocated to the general-purpose frigate. Marles said regional threats, including China, was not part of the consideration. The only criteria here was which would be the best platform for Australia going forward. We’ve been very clear the capability needs to be the fundamental basis upon which we’re making these decisions. Marles says navy shipbuilding contract unrelated to Aukus The defence minister and deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing after Japan beat a German rival to win a $10bn contract to grow Australia’s war fleet. Asked if the deal with the first step towards bringing Japan into Aukus, Marles said the Mogami class vessel was selected “because it’s the best vessel for Australia”, and the US “did not provide a view” on the decision. Both the final two bidders, TKMS, that builds the vessel in Germany, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, that builds the Mogami class, they’re both excellent bids. When we look at the two ships, their cost, the way we sustain them over the long term, it’s the best option. Aukus obviously is very central to our defence posture and what we’re seeking to do in terms of providing a long-range submarine capacity for Australia, as well as innovating in other areas of military technology with the US and the UK, but this decision is really quite separate. When we came to government, we inherited the oldest combat surface fleet the Navy had been operating since the second world war … that was a capability gap. The service fleet review made it clear we need to meet that capability gap. That’s what the general-purpose frigate was about. That’s why we’re moving very quickly in relation to this. Teen e-dirt bike rider accused of fatal crash gets bail A teenage boy charged with manslaughter after he allegedly collided with a pedestrian while he was riding an electric dirt bike has been granted bail with strict conditions, AAP reports. Police allege the 17-year-old struck the 59-year-old woman while riding the e-bike erratically in a public park in Perth’s northern suburbs on 26 July. He appeared via video-link in the West Australian children’s court on Tuesday, when he was granted bail. His conditions of release include not riding any vehicle in public, residing at one of his parents’ homes, a 7pm to 7am curfew at the residence unless accompanied by a parent, submitting to police checks during those hours and surrendering his passport. The prosecution did not oppose bail after a favourable bail service report was returned to the court. Police charged the boy with manslaughter, driving without a licence and riding an unregistered vehicle after the woman died in hospital. He was later also charged with reckless driving and failing to stop when ordered, with police alleging that five minutes before the woman was struck, an officer on a motorbike tried to stop the boy using lights and sirens. The matter will return to the same court on 6 October. The discovery of a father who had been lost in the outback for a week has been hailed as a “miracle” by his family, AAP reports. Gach Top, 26, has been found dehydrated but safe in the Northern Territory, two days after a major search and rescue operation was called off. His family never gave up, continuing to look for the father before he was eventually located about 45km west of Alice Springs on Monday night. Police said he had been taken to hospital for assessment. Top disappeared near his hometown of Alice Springs on 28 July. His car was found at nearby John Flynn’s Grave historical reserve the next day, sparking concerns for his welfare. A massive search operation was launched, including ATVs, drones and aerial support covering more than 500 square kilometres of terrain. Police suspended the search on Saturday following five days of scouring the area west of Alice Springs. However Top’s family members and local volunteers continued to look before the young father was reportedly spotted walking barefoot near Jay Creek outstation by the Aboriginal homeland’s residents on Monday night. Police said Top was found safe near Jay Creek, close to where items of his clothing had been found earlier. The president of the NSW Legislative Council, Ben Franklin, has ruled that MPs taking photographs in the chamber while parliament is sitting will be regarded “as disorderly” and dealt with accordingly. The ruling follows the leaking of texts which Mark Latham allegedly sent to his ex-partner showing women MPs accompanied by derogatory comments. The texts, though private, have caused outrage among MPs, because the photos were taken without the knowledge or consent of the women who featured. Franklin said today that there had already been rulings by previous presidents that selfies were “completely inappropriate”. He said that while phones were permitted in the chamber, it was not permitted to use them as recording devices and that this included taking photos and videos. The parliament has clear rules for the media when it comes to taking photos or filming within the chamber. News photographers are restricted to photographing the person who is speaking – but the rules were less clear for members of parliament. Coalition welcomes announcement Japan will build new Australian navy fleet The Coalition has welcomed today’s news that Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been selected to build the Royal Australian Navy’s next fleet of warships, with the federal government expecting the first to be ready for service by 2030, while continuing to urge Labor to drastically boost defence spending. In a joint statement, the acting shadow minister for defence, Andrew Hastie, and shadow minister for defence industry and personnel Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, said the upgraded Mogami-class frigate would play a “critical role in maintaining peace in our region and deterring aggression”. The Albanese Labor government must ensure that the upgraded Mogami frigates are delivered in a cost-effective and timely manner. Australia needs these frigates in the water as soon as possible to avoid critical gaps in our capability. Hastie and Price said the decision came as Australia faced “the most challenging geopolitical environment since the Second World War”. At a time when our allies and partners are all increasing defence spending, so too must Australia.The Coalition has reaffirmed its support for increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP to meet the demands of the Defence Strategic Review. Australia is on track to lift defence spending from about $53bn a year, or about 2% of GDP – to an estimated $100bn, or 2.4% of GDP, by 2033-34, as the federal government continues to push back on US demands for Australia to drastically increase its defence budget to 3.5% of GDP. That’s all for me, thanks for sticking with us. The great Caitlin Cassidy will guide you through this afternoon’s news. Qantas frequent flyer points get devalued today It will now take quite a bit more Qantas points to book a reward flight. The airline has officially upped the number of points needed for a classic reward by up to 20%, with the starting classic fare on a short-haul domestic flight moving from 8,000 points up to 9,200. Classic upgrade rewards will also increase by up to 20%. It’s the first time Qantas has increased the number of points required for a classic reward in six years. The airline said the change ”will help ensure we can continue investing in the program, maintaining its value for members both now and in the future”. Classic flight rewards on Jetstar’s short-haul domestic flights in Australia and New Zealand were lowered by 11% You can check out the new reward tables here. Should Melbourne have six seasons instead of four? The lord mayor thinks there’s some merit to the idea. Melbourne lord mayor Nicholas Reece said there is some weight behind an idea the city adopt a calendar that references First Nations seasons, rather than the four that have been “superimposed” on the city from northern Europe. Reece was speaking on 3AW earlier about the Melbourne 2050 Summit at the city’s town hall in May. One of the ideas that came out of the summit included the adoption of many seasons referenced in the Wurundjeri calendar. Reece told 3AW: In the Wurundjeri calendar, there were six seasons. It was a wet summer and a dry summer. A wet winter and a dry winter. And when you think about it makes sense. We have gone and superimposed the four seasons, essentially from Northern Europe, here in Melbourne, and they don’t really match up with the weather patterns. … This is actually quite an interesting idea, don’t just rule it out … you’ve gotta think about it. … This is one of those things where a bit of First Nations knowledge appears to make a bit more sense. Reece went on to say he tracked Melbourne’s wattle trees himself, saying their flowering lined up extremely well with the Wurundjeri calendar: It’s extraordinary. Literally wattle season starts and that week you look around Melbourne and all of the wattle trees have turned fluorescent yellow and it’s beautiful. Household spending on non-essentials up as cost-of-living pressures ease, ABS data shows Australians have been splashing out on new cars, food and electronics as price pressures ease, AAP reports. Household spending rose 0.5% in June on top of a 1% increase in May as shoppers shelled out for new goods, official figures show. Spending on furnishings and household equipment led the charge, growing by 2%, while clothing and shoes rose by 1.6% and food increased by 1.5% in Australian Bureau of Statistics data released on Tuesday. Australians spent less on alcohol and tobacco, health and eating out in June. Compared to same month in 2024, Australians spent 7.9% more on recreation and culture and 7.5% more on food, with household spending overall sitting 4.8% higher. More on the Gareth Ward showdown Returning to the potential constitutional showdown with the state’s supreme court over parliament’s attempt to expel local MP and convicted rapist Gareth Ward. The hearing for the matter has now been brought forward by a day to 9.30am Thursday and will be heard by the court of appeal. It came after the Minns government sought an earlier hearing in the court to lift an ex parte injunction granted the previous day to Ward. It prevented parliament from moving to expel the member for Kiama. In a directions hearing before Justice Julie Ward, the president of the court of appeal, the lawyer acting for Gareth Ward, Peter King, said bringing the hearing forward earlier than Thursday could interfere with the King’s mother’s 95th birthday. He also noted there was also the challenge of getting instructions from Ward given he is remanded in custody in the Hunter Valley. Julie Ward responded: You’re the ones that have invoked the jurisdiction of the court. Ordinarily one would not expect the matter would be going on for a long time. More on this story here: Kmart ‘disappointed’ by federal court application over supply chain Kmart has expressed its disappointment at a federal court application that could force it to produce documents showing how much it knows about the operations of two factories in China’s Xinjiang region. The application by the Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Women’s Association, supported by law firm Maurice Blackburn and the Human Rights Law Centre, seeks to establish whether Kmart “adequately implemented its ethical sourcing procedures regarding these suppliers”. The three groups believe “there are credible links between two of its factories/suppliers and the use of Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang”. In a statement, a Kmart spokesperson said it invited the association to meet it on several occasions to better understand their concerns. Kmart has been in correspondence with the applicant’s lawyers for over 12 months and has provided extensive details of our ethical sourcing program. We take all reports of modern slavery risk within our supply chains very seriously. Where we learn of an alleged non compliance with our code through an audit, site visit or complaint, or by a worker in a supplier’s factory, we take action to investigate and remediate the issue, working collaboratively with the supplier. Senators behind PwC parliamentary hearings ask finance department to maintain ban on consultancy firm Three senators that led parliamentary hearings into PwC Australia have written to the finance department, urging it to reconsider a decision to lift a ban on the consultancy firm working with the federal government. Last month, Guardian Australia revealed the finance department had recommended the end of a long-term ban triggered by a scandal involving the misuse of confidential Treasury information. The matter is still being investigated by the Australian Federal Police and has been referred to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Finance completed a 47-page review into the firm and shared it with Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, Greens senator Barbara Pocock and Liberal senator Richard Colbeck last month. The completed report was due to be published on 25 July. But after receiving a briefing from her department, the finance minister Katy Gallagher asked for the views of the three senators to be considered before the department’s review was “finalised and published”. The letter, seen by Guardian Australia, said “we believe the department’s decision is premature and that in line with our recommendations, the firm should remain excluded from government contracting, at least until all ongoing investigations are complete”. It went on: PwC has been excluded from contracting with the Australian government since April last year. In our view, there is no meaningful justification for giving them the green light after such little time and while significant investigations remain ongoing. The finance department and the finance minister were contacted for comment. Thousands of Australian students begin global Pisa tests About 20,000 Australian students are taking part in one of the world’s largest global measure of skills. The OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) has been conducted every three years since 2000 to evaluate how 15-year-old students apply knowledge in reading, science, mathematics and different “innovative domains”. It is managed in Australia by the Australian Council for Educational Research (Acer). The online assessment will run over the next six weeks across 92 countries, including Australia. Findings are expected to be released in September next year. For the first time this cycle, students will take part in a new domain, “Learning in the Digital World”, which will ask students to solve algorithmic problems with the help of digital tools to assess these emerging skills. Australian science teachers of 15-year-olds will also be invited to answer questionnaires about how science, including environmental literacy, is taught across schools and school systems. The most recent results, released in 2023, found Australia’s year 9 students had climbed into the top 10 of OECD countries, while continuing a longer-term trend of national decline. Search continues along Tasmanian coastline for missing plane carrying couple and their dog Emergency officials are continuing their search today for a small plane that went missing on Saturday afternoon after leaving Tasmania’s George Town airport en route to regional NSW. A Tasmania police helicopter will patrol the state’s northern coastline as it searches for the twin-seater aircraft, which was carrying a married couple and their dog. Rough weather conditions on the water have prevented marine vessels from assisting the search today. Nick Clark, an inspector for Tasmania police, said in a statement: Inclement weather is limiting our search options, however we are continuing our efforts to locate the plane and its occupants and will be utilising the helicopter. The plane in question is a two-seat, single engine aircraft, and a distinctive bright green in colour. Fog lifts on Sydney Harbour after week of rain It’s blue skies in Sydney this afternoon after a week of relentless rain, but that wasn’t so earlier this morning when the harbour completely disappeared under a thick fog. Dramatic footage captured the moment the fog lifted to reveal the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House. NSW faces constitutional showdown New South Wales politicians are facing a potential constitutional showdown with the state’s supreme court over parliament’s attempt to expel local MP and convicted rapist Gareth Ward. The Minns government was seeking an urgent hearing in the supreme court on Tuesday with a view to lifting an ex parte injunction granted the previous day to Ward. It prevented parliament, for now, from moving to expel the member for Kiama. Ward commenced the proceedings on Monday night via his lawyers from Silverwater jail, where he has been remanded pending sentencing in September. Read more about the showdown here: ‘Historic’ racism survey to roll out at Australian universities The Australian Human Rights Commission is launching the largest survey in the nation’s history into racism at Australian universities. The online survey, launching next week, forms part of an ongoing Racism@Uni review led by the commission under the directive of the federal government. Findings are expected to be delivered in December. The survey will ask university students and staff across the country about the prevalence, nature and impact of racism on campuses. All current staff and students 18 years and over at participating Australian universities will be invited to take part anonymously via their university email account. The race discrimination commissioner, Giridharan Sivaraman, said the survey was a “historic and timely opportunity” to reveal how racism manifested in university spaces and how it was navigated: Every university student and staff member deserves to feel safe in their place of study or work, and this is a chance for them to be heard. The findings of the survey will be instrumental in informing recommendations to the Australian government and Australia’s universities. An interim report delivered by the commission in 2024 found both interpersonal and structural racism were pervasive and deeply entrenched in Australian universities. The Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Women’s Association has filed a federal court application to force Kmart to supply documents that show much it knows about the operations of two factories in China’s Xinjiang region. The application, supported by law firm Maurice Blackburn and the Human Rights Law Centre, will seek to establish whether Kmart “adequately implemented its ethical sourcing procedures regarding these suppliers”. In a joint statement, the three groups said if the documents showed Kmart had not rigorously monitored any use of forced labour in the factories, it may pave the way for a legal claim that Kmart engaged in deceiving or misleading conduct. The three groups believe “there are credible links between two of its factories/suppliers and the use of Uyghur forced labour in Xinjiang”. This case is the first of its kind in seeking to bring real accountability home to Australian retailers in relation to the risk of Uyghur forced labour infecting their supply chains. Documents will be sought from Kmart to determine whether Kmart engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct about the use of Uyghur forced labour. Kmart was contacted for comment. Wilkie welcomes $135m bailout for Nystar metal facility Independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie has welcomed a joint support package for the metal producer Nystar, warning a knock-on effect in the Tasmanian economy would have been “severe” without intervention. Nyrstar will get a $135m bailout from a coalition of the federal government and the governments of South Australia and Tasmania, which will support the company’s Port Pirie facility in SA. Wilkie said today’s announcement was “obviously good news”. The zincworks employs hundreds of workers and supports numerous contractors and suppliers, all of whom would have been hit hard if the plant had shut down. The knock-on effect in the Hobart and broader Tasmanian economy would have been severe. The survival of the zinc works … is also central to Australia’s economic future and national security. Now, more than ever, Australia needs to focus on maintaining and building on the country’s processing and manufacturing capacity, and also to develop more robust supply chains. When it comes to critical minerals and rare earth minerals in particular, Australia is remarkably well positioned to be a globally important supplier. Walkie said he had been in regular contact with Nystar and the industry minister, Senator Tim Ayres, and was “confident” the federal government well understood the situation. More than 5,800 charges have been laid under Queensland’s ‘adult crime, adult time’ legislation. The director general, Sarah Cruikshank, revealed in state parliamentary estimates that about 1,250 children have been charged under the making Queensland safer bills, which passed in December and in May. About 85% of the charges laid under the legislation were of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, entering premises and burglary, in that order, she said, representing more than 30% of the cases going through the children’s court. The attorney general, Deb Frecklington, told estimates “nearly half of all juveniles sentenced for an adult crime … are now spending time remanded in custody before their case is finalised”. We are starting to see more young people sentenced to more intensive sentences, detention and probation, with a corresponding drop in less intensive sentences, like good behaviour orders and community service orders. The laws violate the rights of children including their right to be free from “protection from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”, discriminate against them, and will disproportionately affect Indigenous Queenslanders. More on MP Gareth Ward More on convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward seeking an injunction to stop him being expelled from the New South Wales parliament, and which will see him remain, for now, the state member for Kiama. The New South Wales supreme court confirmed on Tuesday morning that Ward had launched proceedings against Labor MP and leader of the house, Ron Hoenig. The common law duty judge, Justice Deborah Sweeney, made an order that Hoenig be restrained from taking “any steps to expel or otherwise resolve to expel” up to and including Friday at 10am. This is when a one-hour hearing for the matter is currently set. A five-minute directions hearing is planned for tomorrow. 1800 Lasagne, a Melbourne dining darling, has entered into voluntary administration. The restaurant said it was working closely with an administration team to “streamline and restructure our model to ensure we take the best steps while moving forward”, saying: Our loyal suppliers and our beloved staff are and will continue to be our highest priority through this process. 1800 Lasagne has always been about people, passion and plates of love – and that hasn’t changed. We’re grateful for the support of our incredible community and encourage everyone to keep showing love and support to local hospitality. Police investigating fatal stabbing of teenage girl in Lake Macquarie NSW police have established a strike force after the fatal stabbing of a teenage girl in Lake Macquarie last night. Officers responded to reports of a stabbing about 10.20pm last night, and on arrival emergency services found the teen with an injury to her torso. She was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to a local hospital, but was pronounced dead later that night. She is believed to be 14, but has not been formally identified. Another girl, 13, was arrested at the scene and remains in police custody. Police said the pair were known to each other. Officials said a kitchen knife was located during a search of the home and has been seized for forensic analysis. No charges have been laid. Aussie editor to lead new rightwing tabloid in California In case you missed it in our story today about Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp launching a Californian, rightwing tabloid next year – the new boss will be an Aussie import (presumably without the tariffs). Nick Papps, weekend editor of Melbourne’s Herald Sun and a man with a long history with the company, will be the editor-in-chief of the California Post, a version of the company’s New York Post. It comes as Murdoch’s relationship with US president Donald Trump has hit some wobbles. News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said: Los Angeles and California surely need a daily dose of The Post as an antidote to the jaundiced, jaded journalism that has sadly proliferated. The metal producer Nyrstar will get a $135m bailout from a coalition of the federal government and the governments of South Australia and Tasmania, which will support the company’s Port Pirie facility in SA. Nyrstar said in June its lead smelter in Port Pirie was losing tens of millions of dollars a month, saying the future of its zinc smelter in Hobart was linked to the success of the one in SA. It called on urgent government intervention, the ABC reported at the time. The federal government will kick in $57.5m, South Australia $55m and Tasmania $22.5m, the SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, said in a news conference: This $55 million contribution from the South Australian government is part of a $135 million package that’s all about setting up Port Pirie for a more prosperous future. We know there is a journey in front of us to be able to tackle the challenges we see, particularly coming out of China. But we should be upfront and honest about them. First Nations group applies to halt Olympic stadium development A First Nations’ group has made a bid to halt development of an Olympic stadium in inner-city Brisbane. Victoria Park is slated to play host to both the 2032 opening and closing ceremonies, at a brand-new 63,000 seat stadium, among other venues. The state government recently passed legislation overruling a swathe of state laws to get around a mooted legal challenge, including heritage, planning and environment acts. The Yagara Magandjin Aboriginal Corporation and advocacy group Save Victoria Park made an application under section 10 of the federal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, which allows the commonwealth to declare long-term protection of a significant Aboriginal area. The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, ruled out a stadium in the park during last years’ state election. YMAC spokesperson and Yagarabul elder Gaja Kerry Charlton said: We know this is a place of great significance and history, not only for Yagara people, but for other First Nations and non-Aboriginal people as well. It was a complete shock when the premier came out with his stadium plans. He said the park would be protected from stadiums; I thought the park was safe. Now the government wants to destroy it. We are very concerned there are ancient trees, artefacts and very important ecosystems existing there. There may be ancestral remains. An updated on SES rescues during flooding in NSW the last few days The NSW State Emergency Service received more than 4,300 calls and responded to more than 2,300 incidents over the last few days amid intense rainfall across parts of the state. That included 34 flood rescues. Parts of low-lying areas in Gunnedah remain under evacuation orders, and the SES is moving assets to some areas near Wee Waa and Narrabri in anticipation of possible river rises as flood waters move downstream. But flooding is easing in the Hunter. Still, more than 40 warnings are still in place across the mid-north coast, the upper Hunter and New England regions. You can see how those affect your area at the Hazard Watch site. NBN picks Amazon’s Kuiper to replace satellite service The 300,000 homes in regional and remote parts of Australia that were only able to access the NBN via the ageing Skymuster satellites will be able to upgrade to low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite services beginning mid-2026 under a deal signed between NBN Co and Amazon. Despite hundreds of thousands of Australians already switching to Elon Musk’s Starlink, Amazon won out the deal to provide LEO services to the 300,000 homes covered by the Skymuster satellites that will be decommissioned in 2030, following a request for proposal process. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but NBN chief executive Ellie Sweeney said the agreement would be funded by NBN Co rather than needing a cash injection from taxpayers. The services will begin to come online mid-2026, starting in Tasmania, as Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellites begin to cover Australia. Full coverage should take weeks, the company said. NBN Co will begin consultation with communities and retail service providers in the coming weeks on product offerings, speed tiers, wholesale pricing and the upgrade process required for those on the existing satellite service. Users on Starlink today pay a premium for the service compared with NBN pricing, and Sweeney said equity would be an important feature in the pricing so someone in regional Australia has the same level of service as someone in metropolitan areas. Sweeney said: It’s now time to evolve, with full fibre in many areas, in upgraded fixed wireless in others and now with LEO satellites, we’re committed to ending buffering in the bush. Queensland government releases second damning report into state DNA lab Queensland’s state government has released more information about the work of its public DNA laboratory. Yesterday’s review by forensic scientist Prof Kirsty Wright found that virtually all forensic science work done at the laboratory was being done late, typically by hundreds of days. A second review, by FBI expert Dr Bruce Budowle, found the service remains “in a state of sustained crisis”. He found that scientific methods had been implemented “without proper validation”, risking the “integrity” of the results, but others not adopted due to “perceived or real challenges” which could have been overcome. Budowle said: The workplace culture at FSQ appeared to the Review Team to be quite toxic. A pair of commissions of inquiry in 2022 and 2023 uncovered systematic errors within the laboratory – including an error which called into question DNA evidence used in thousands of criminal cases, including for crimes such as rape and murder. Wright found the same error had been repeated again last year. She recommended contracting out most of the work done by the lab to outside laboratories while it undertakes reform. Motion to be moved by NSW Labor MPs condemns ‘ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians from Gaza’ Guardia Australia has obtained a copy of the motion NSW Labor MPs are planning to move in a party meeting today condemning conditions in Gaza and endorsing the right to protest. The motion, to be moved by upper house member Sarah Kaine and seconded by MP Lynda Voltz, moves that the caucus: Condemns the destruction of Gaza, the mass civilian deaths and the Israeli government’s open endorsement of the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians from Gaza. Condemns all crimes against humanity, including genocide, the murder of civilians and the hostage taking. Thanks the people of Sydney for the mass protest rally conducted peacefully on Sunday. Endorses the right to protest Requests the attorney general to report back to caucus with an options paper for the development of a Human Rights Act in this term of the parliament, which we note the attorney has already said he supports. My colleague Anne Davies had more on this story yesterday: Police divers aiding search for woman swept away in NSW floods Police divers are joining the search for a woman swept away by flood waters on Saturday near Cessnock in NSW. Rescuers have been searching for the 26-year-old woman for days after responding to reports a car was trapped in a flood in the town of Rothbury. Officers said the driver of the car, a Mini Countryman, attempted to travel through flood waters before becoming stuck. The driver, a 27-year-old woman, was rescued, but the passenger was swept away. The missing woman is a Chinese national who was working as an engineer in Australia, where she has lived for three years. NSW opposition supports Ward’s expulsion Mark Speakman, leader of the NSW opposition, said he will support the government in seeking Gareth Ward’s expulsion. Speakman said: The opposition will support Gareth Ward’s expulsion and work with the government to get this done as quickly as possible. However, Mr Ward’s legal team should do whatever it takes to get a clear message to him – immediately resign. Every day he clings to his seat from a jail cell, taxpayers are footing the bill and the people of Kiama are left voiceless. It’s not just wrong, it’s offensive. Ward’s conviction has thrown the NSW parliament into uncharted territory. As an independent he has not had the usual pressure to resign. He remains eligible to sit in parliament until all appeals are exhausted. However, the parliament has power to expel him if his conduct would damage the integrity of the parliament and endanger its proper functioning. The government had planned to begin moves to expel him today with a vote expected Wednesday. Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward has sought an injunction to stop him being expelled from the New South Wales parliament, which will see him remain, for now, the state member for Kiama. Ward has commenced the proceedings via his lawyers from Silverwater jail where he has been remanded pending sentence in the criminal proceedings in September. He has said he will appeal against his conviction on three counts of indecent assault and one for sexual intercourse without consent. The premier, Chris Minns, said on 2GB on Tuesday that Ward’s lawyers had sought the interim injunction overnight against the leader of the lower house, Ron Hoenig, and speaker, Greg Piper, which prevented the parliament moving a suspension order until the court can deal with the application. The government has sought an urgent supreme court hearing later in the week. Minns told 2GB: We’ve got a week of parliament to sit, and I think that most people would appreciate, it’s an unconscionable situation to have someone who’s currently sitting in jail in Silverwater, convicted of serious sexual offences, who is demanding to remain a member of parliament and continue to be paid. Melbourne Demons sack coach Simon Goodwin Simon Goodwin, Melbourne’s only AFL premiership coach in the past 60 years, has been sacked by the Demons, AAP reports. The former Adelaide champion, who led the club to its drought-breaking 2021 flag, has been let go by the Demons after just seven wins this season. Taking over from Paul Roos in a succession plan for the 2017 season, Goodwin led Melbourne to their first premiership in 57 years. But off-field turmoil and dwindling performances on the field placed the 48-year-old’s job in jeopardy. My colleague Jack Snape has more on this story here: All Sydney ferries back up and running after heavy fog All ferries in Sydney have resumed services after they were halted amid heavy fog. Here are some photos from the Kirribilli wharf this morning, with the Sydney Opera House in the distance. Here’s some video footage of Sydney Harbour this morning The defence minister, Richard Marles, will announce this morning that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will build the Royal Australian Navy’s new $10bn frigate fleet. The Japanese company beat out Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems for the deal. Marles and the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, will make the announcement just before 9am this morning. The national security committee of cabinet made the decision last night, choosing the Japanese-built Mogami frigate. The first three frigates will be built overseas before being brought to Australia by 2029. The rest are expected to be built at the Henderson shipyards in Perth. The new general purpose warships are designed to replace the ageing Anzac-class frigates, as they are retired from service by the navy. So, just how big was the march on the Sydney Harbour Bridge? The number of people who joined a pro-Palestine march across Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday exceeded everyone’s expectations. But just how many braved the rainy weather to urge the Australian government to do more to pressure Israel to stop the death and destruction in Gaza? That’s been a sticking point. New South Wales police said initial estimates put the crowd at 90,000. A spokesperson for rally organisers, the Palestine Action Group, said police had informed them 100,000 people were in attendance – but the group estimated the figure was closer to 300,000. What does an independent expert have to say? Sydney wakes up to a shroud of fog Some pictures of the fog that blanketed Sydney this morning: Shadow attorney general says recognising Palestinian statehood would send ‘bad signal’ The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, said the recognition of a Palestinian state by Australia would reward Hamas and send a “bad signal around the world”. Leeser spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying while he wants to see a two-state solution, he believes the world is “further away from that today than at any point in the past”. Lesser said: I don’t want to see people suffering. I want to see the aid getting through and I want to see Hamas releasing the hostages because it’s only when the hostages are released and only when Hamas plays no further part in the future of the region that a stable and lasting peace in the Middle East can come about. … I think [recognising a Palestinian state] will send a bad signal around the world to other terrorist organisations that if you increase your level of intransigence, if you maintain your position, then you will achieve your aims … Let me be very clear, I want to see a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. It’s something I’ve believed in for decades. But we seem to be further away from that today than at any point in the past, and that is largely because of the role that Hamas is playing in Gaza. Anthony Albanese spoke to Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, in a phone call overnight. The prime minister reiterated Australia’s call for the immediate entry of aid into Gaza, a permanent ceasefire, and the release of all Israeli hostages still held by terror group Hamas, according to a readout of the call circulated by the PM’s office. Albanese also reinforced Australia’s commitment to a two state solution, which he said was crucial to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. President Abbas thanked Albanese for Australia’s economic and humanitarian support. Australia pledged another $20m to aid in Gaza over the weekend. The two leaders also spoke about deepening cooperation on several areas. They also agreed to meet on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, to be held in New York City in September. This is the forum where several major nations are expected to pledge to recognise a Palestinian state – a move Albanese’s government is under pressure to replicate. Wong says there is a risk ‘there will be no Palestine left to recognise’ The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Sunday’s march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge reflected the “distress of Australians on what we are seeing unfolding in Gaza”. Asked on RN Breakfast this morning whether the march had accelerated any government plans to recognise Palestinian statehood, Wong said: In relation to recognition, I’ve said for over a year now it’s a matter of when, not if. I would say … there is a risk there will be no Palestine left to recognise if the international community don’t move to create that pathway to a two-state solution. Wong would not comment on further sanctions on Israel, saying Australia’s preference remained moving with other countries on such matters so they have “more effect”. It has been my long-held position that there will be no peace and security, for the people of Israel, unless we resolve to a Palestinian state. That has been my view for decades. The Waratah super battery, a massive project meant to bolster the energy grid in New South Wales, is now partially online. The battery project at Colongra, south of Lake Macquarie, is meant to be a “shock absorber” for customers across the Hunter, Sydney and the Illawarra, allowing transmission lines in the region to run at greater capacity and serving as a backup in case of a power line outage due to an event like a lightning strike or a bushfire. The battery system, when fully operational, will be the most powerful in Australia and one of the biggest in the world. The first 350 megawatts of the 850MW project is now in operation at the site of the former Munmorah coal-fired power station. Hannah McCaughey, the chief of EnergyCo NSW, said: Switching on the Waratah Super Battery Project is a win for our grid and a win for households and businesses across NSW … It’s a fantastic example of how new technologies bring new solutions for our energy needs. Good morning Nick Visser here to take over for Martin Farrer. Let’s get to it. The latest information is that some ferries have resumed as the fog lifts. The ferry operator says: Ferries east of the Harbour Bridge now operating after earlier heavy fog. F3 and F4 ferries are still affected by the fog, with some cancelled between Rydalmere &amp; Circular Quay and between Olympic Park &amp; Barangaroo. No Sydney ferries are running at the moment due to the heavy fog, according to an advisory from the NSW transport department. They say: Make alternative arrangements or consider catching a bus instead. Also, listen to announcements &amp; check info displays for updates. At this stage there is no forecast when ferry services will resume. Palestine Action Group plans more nationwide protests to build on ‘massive momentum’ Palestine Action Group organiser Josh Lees says the group is planning protests in Sydney and other cities following the Sydney Harbour Bridge march on Sunday, Australian Associated Press reports. “We want to build on this massive momentum we have now,” he told reporters yesterday with protests planned for Sunday 24 August. Despite concerns of regular marches across the bridge, Lees said the group has no plans for a repeat crossing any time soon and accused the NSW premier, Chris Minns, of having an anti-protest agenda. Lees said: His stance is pretty clear and he’s passed a raft of anti-protest legislation already. We’re going to have to keep fighting for our rights to demonstrate. Penny Wong was asked if the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, planned to use “the threat of recognition” of a Palestinian state as “a point of leverage” as the UK has, in his forthcoming call with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu. She declined to say, answering: “You would anticipate that the prime minister in his international interactions, just reflects the position we articulate as an Australian government, as do I.” She pointed to Australia’s sanctions on “extremist settlers and … entities that are associated with that”, and said: We want to do what we can to preserve the possibility of a Palestinian state … Australia believes that’s the only way to assure peace and security for Israelis and for Palestinians. Asked what steps the government was taking ahead of a September UN conference where Palestinian recognition will lead the agenda, Wong said there was “a lot of coordination and discussion with other parties and other countries”. I think we all recognise this might be, I think someone said, ‘our last hope’… we cannot stand by with what is happening in Gaza and not add momentum towards two states. We cannot stand by whilst the prospect of a Palestinian state is diminished on the ground by settlements and other statements … As I keep saying, I cannot see long-term stability and peace for Israelis and Palestinians unless the Palestinian issue is resolved: the issue of the Palestinian state. That was the promise that the international community made when we established, as a collective, the state of Israel. Australia’s foreign affairs minister was asked on the ABC’s 7.30 last night if Sunday’s march for Gaza on the Sydney Harbour Bridge would directly impact government policy. “That was an extraordinary march and I think it demonstrates what we all feel,” Wong answered. I know that Australians are feeling distressed, angry, upset, really horrified by what they’re seeing in Gaza. I certainly share that distress. So do ministers in the government. The program’s host, Sarah Ferguson, pushed her: “If it wasn’t Israel, would the world’s response be tougher?” Wong referred back to the government’s announcement yesterday of a further $20m in aid. “Even the US has made its position on [the stopping of aid] very clear … they are probably the strongest ally of Israel.” She described ongoing deaths from starvation in the Palestinian territory as “horrific”. “As the prime minister said, it can’t be justified. It can’t be defended.” Still, Wong did defend Australia’s response, saying: We’re not the central player. But what we have done is worked with others in the international community to press for, to call for aid and humanitarian support to be delivered safely, and at scale. I think you have seen quite a lot, a great deal of pressure being applied to the Israelis on that front, both publicly and beyond. Wong refused to say directly whether Israel was “using starvation as a weapon of war”, replying: “I think it is impossible to justify the withholding of aid from civilians.” Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories, and then it’ll be Nick Visser to take the controls. Penny Wong has called the Sydney Harbour Bridge pro-Palestine march as “extraordinary” but defended the government’s refusal to follow the UK, France and Canada in taking steps towards recognising Palestinian statehood. We have details of what she said on 7.30 last night coming up. Wong’s comments came as pro-Palestine groups said they wanted to build on the success of the Sydney protest. Further protests are planned on Sunday 24 August in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth with hopes more can be organised in other cities. More coming up. Plus – Sydney has woken up to a foggy morning, which means (for now) the ferries aren’t running.
