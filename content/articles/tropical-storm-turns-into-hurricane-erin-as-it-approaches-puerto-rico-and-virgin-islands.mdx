  A tropical storm sped up to become Hurricane Erin mid-morning on Friday, as it
  approached Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing heavy rains that could
  cause flooding and landslides on its way to becoming a major Atlantic
  hurricane. The huge storm was swirling across the Caribbean and is ultimately
  expected to head towards Florida, picking up speed over warm ocean water,
  before ultimately veering away from the US mainland. The first hurricane of
  the 2025 Atlantic season was rolling west/north-west at 18mph (29km/h) on
  Friday afternoon, with winds reaching maximum speeds of around 75mph
  (121km/h), a category 1 hurricane. It is expected to become a major hurricane
  by Sunday morning. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami reported on X
  that Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, was several
  hundred miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, with maximum sustained
  winds of 70mph. It had been expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday
  early afternoon but reached the designation a little earlier, as it approached
  the north-east Caribbean, prompting forecasters to warn of possible flooding
  and landslides, and strengthen into a major category 3 storm late this
  weekend. The NHC has warned of the storm strengthening into a category 3
  hurricane, bringing possible flooding and landslides. Private sector
  forecaster AccuWeather went further. “Erin is forecast to explode into a
  powerful category 4 hurricane as it moves across very warm waters in the open
  Atlantic. Water temperatures at the surface and hundreds of feet deep are
  several degrees higher than the historical average,” said Alex DaSilva,
  AccuWeather’s lead hurricane expert. Storm watches were issued for Anguilla
  and Barbuda, St Martin and St Barts, Saba and St Eustatius and St Maarten,
  with torrential rain forecast to start late Friday in Antigua and Barbuda, the
  US and British Virgin Islands, and the southern and eastern parts of the US
  territory of Puerto Rico, east of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Up to 4in
  (10cm) of rain are expected in the region, with isolated totals of up to 6in,
  according to the NHC. Forecasters have also warned of dangerous swells. “There
  is still uncertainty about what impacts Erin may bring to portions of the
  Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and Bermuda in the long range,”
  NHC said on Friday. Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry
  said to the Associated Press that Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp
  turn north-east that would put it on a path between the US and Bermuda. “The
  forecasts for next week still keep the future hurricane safely east of the
  mainland US,” he said. Erin formed from a cluster of showers and thunderstorms
  that moved off the African coast last week, becoming a tropical rainstorm near
  the Cabo Verde Islands and dumping up to 8in of rain in five hours. Televisão
  África reported that at least six people died, with more missing, after flash
  flooding. AccuWeather predicted Erin would create dangerous surf and rip
  currents up the US east coast next week, with waves reaching up to 15ft in
  North Carolina.
