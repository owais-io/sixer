  Music is a lifeline for Abigail and Shaun Bengson. Baring their souls through
  song, Ohio is introduced as a “death concert” in response to the indie-folk
  musicians’ young son asking what happens when we die. But this bittersweet
  story of family, faith and loss is almost ferociously about grabbing hold of
  life. The Bengsons create harmonies that glide directly to the top of your
  spine. Both clearly feel the music in their bones, but it’s Abigail who shows
  it, her body unable to resist moving to the tumbling scales they create
  together, her bright, beaming face turned up to the sky. Director Caitlin
  Sullivan helps the pair gracefully shape their story on stage, treading softly
  between gig, presentation and choir rehearsal. The potted narrative sticks
  closer to Shaun, who is the drily comic balance to Abigail’s bounding
  enthusiasm. Guiding us through his repressive Lutheran upbringing, he eases
  out of the religion’s grasp but holds on to what faith means for his father,
  and what his father means to him. Narrowing our focus, the show homes in on
  Shaun’s degenerative hearing loss. In one revelatory scene, their microphones
  are modulated for us to understand what Shaun hears now, certain tones and
  consonants absent to him, then thickening and distorting as that blank
  mugginess will intensify over time. With creative captions that tremble as the
  sensory experience distorts, this slow theft is devastatingly wrought. The
  pair create the atmosphere of holding our hands throughout, with angelic,
  ululating folk song accompanying the thoughtful ways they see and explain
  life. Their story serves as both a formal introduction to them as a couple as
  well as a deeply spiritual meditation on the world we live in. A revenant hush
  accompanies everything they say. A song to Shaun’s choirmistress who helped a
  shy, almost unspoken child unfurl is shattering. Made freshly aware of time
  slipping through our fingers, no one wants to miss a moment. At Upstairs at
  Assembly Roxy, Edinburgh, until 24 August. Then at Young Vic, London, 30
  September-24 October All our Edinburgh festival reviews
