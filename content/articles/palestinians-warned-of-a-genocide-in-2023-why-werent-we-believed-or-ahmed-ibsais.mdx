  Today I watched those children again, the ones who stood before the cameras at
  al-Shifa hospital on 7 November 2023. They spoke in English, not their mother
  tongue, but the language of those who they thought might save them. “We want
  to live, we want peace, we want to judge the killers of children,” one boy
  said. “We want medicine, food and education. We want to live as the other
  children live.” Even then, the children pleaded. They had no clean drinking
  water, no food, no medicine. Now, 21 months later, as 60,000 confirmed
  Palestinian corpses pile higher, or in mass graves, and independent estimates
  show over 100,000 dead, something has happened. Suddenly, the same
  institutions that spent months debating, or more actively denying, whether
  Palestinian testimony deserved credence are finding their voices. Western
  academics speak of “genocide” with newfound authority. Two Israeli human
  rights organizations issued reports declaring what Palestinians have screamed
  from under rubble since October. They say they are “experts”, but it took them
  two years to see what was always before them: that a sky that delivers bombs
  was never looking for hostages. Why weren’t our corpses enough? What renders
  Palestinian death so consistently unconvincing to those who witness our
  slaughter in real time? What is it about our breath, our blood, our bodies,
  that makes them so easy to doubt, so easy to dismiss, so easy to destroy? It
  is not the eyes that are blind, but the hearts. The answer lies not in our
  deaths but in how we are constructed as less than human from the moment we
  draw breath. Palestinian dehumanization is philosophical, deliberate,
  essential to the colonial project. We must be made into something other than
  human so that our elimination becomes necessary violence. The colonizer
  requires the colonized to be beasts so that caging us appears humane and
  killing us appears justified. This same dehumanization allows the media to
  place the genocide of Palestinians within the context of 7 October 2023, to
  act as if history started two years ago, but never place 7 October in the
  context of 77 years of colonial dispossession and 17 years of complete siege.
  When Palestinian experts appeared on television saying this was genocide, they
  were berated, attacked, dismissed. Now it seems only non-Palestinians can
  declare it genocide, as if they are being brave, as if Palestinians haven’t
  been fired, doxed and imprisoned for describing our killers as evil. Perhaps
  they wanted eulogies for the soldiers who murdered our children? Christiane
  Amanpour, and those like her, speaks of her epiphany about genocide only after
  the Israeli writer David Grossman comes to his sad realization that Israel is
  committing genocide. Palestinians can only narrate if accompanied by
  authority. But I don’t recognize an authority that can’t feel 22,000lb bombs
  that have killed a classroom of children every day for 670 days. How holy
  their concern now sounds, rising over a land emptied of the living. These
  newfound experts, the same voices that spent 21 months debating whether
  witnessing mass slaughter constituted evidence of mass slaughter, now speak
  with such authority about our suffering. But even Israeli validation comes
  with escape hatches built in. When B’Tselem finally published their report,
  calling it Our Genocide, they spent 88 pages dancing around the legal
  definition they claimed to embrace. They acknowledged genocidal acts while
  avoiding the question of genocidal intent, the very element that makes
  genocide legally prosecutable. Did they forget Netanyahu compared us to
  Amalek? That he called for our biblical death? The media enabled this genocide
  from the start. When Israeli officials announced they had seen “40 beheaded
  babies” and the world moved to war, there were no photos required, no
  verification needed. Former US president Joe Biden repeated this blood libel
  multiple times, even after his own staff admitted he never saw such images.
  The White House walked back his statements twice. Haaretz investigated and
  found only one infant died on 7 October, shot, not beheaded. But the lie had
  already traveled around the world while Palestinian truth was still begging
  for a hearing. When Israel killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen
  in April 2024, precision-striking their clearly marked vehicles in three
  separate hits, they called it an “unintentional mistake”. When they
  systematically murdered over 200 journalists, more than in any war in recorded
  history, each death was labeled an unfortunate accident. When they created the
  highest concentration of child amputees in the world, this too is presented as
  an unintended consequence. The pattern never changes. Israel commits a war
  crime, promises to investigate itself, and quietly concludes months later that
  procedures were followed correctly. Yet, the world expects us to forgive and
  forget. Until recently, Piers Morgan paraded Palestinian advocates across his
  stage, a courtroom where the oppressed are always on trial. Rehearsed, he
  asked each guest the same question: “Do you condemn Hamas?” In that moment,
  every Palestinian was stripped of grief and forced into a posture of apology.
  The follow-up question is just as predictable: “Does Israel have a right to
  defend itself?” The occupier, we are told, has a sacred right to violence. The
  occupied must earn the right to grieve. Israel’s so-called “defense” is never
  interrogated, even though international law grants no such right to an
  occupying power against the people it occupies. International law is
  unambiguous, when it chooses to remember its own language. It affirms the
  right of all peoples to self-determination, and in UN Resolution 3236, it
  enshrines the right to resist occupation by “any means necessary”. Apparently
  these laws do not apply to Palestinian flesh. Israel has violated every
  principle of international law: the prohibition on apartheid, the crime of
  forcible transfer, the destruction of cultural property, the targeting of
  civilians, the use of starvation as a weapon of war. And now genocide, the
  highest crime of all. Western regimes expect us not to recognize this reality,
  perhaps because they have seen how the world has not moved swiftly to stop
  this genocide, they know they can commit it again. The Intercept’s analysis of
  over 1,000 articles from major newspapers during the first six weeks after 7
  October 2023 reveals the systematic nature of dehumanization. Humanizing
  language was reserved almost exclusively for Israeli suffering: “slaughter”
  appeared in a 60:1 ratio favoring Israeli over Palestinian deaths, “massacre”
  at 125:2, and “horrific” at 36:4. This was systematic preparation for
  genocide, the deliberate murder of language itself. Edward Said understood
  this decades ago. In Permission to Narrate, he showed how Palestinians are
  robbed of the right to tell our own story, how our voices are filtered through
  the lens of those who wish us gone. Said knew that the question was never
  whether Palestinians could speak, we always spoke. The question was who would
  be allowed to listen, and under what conditions our words would be deemed
  credible. But I understand now why the discourse shifts, why genocide suddenly
  becomes speakable after so much death. It’s not because Palestinian voices
  gained credibility, it’s because Palestinian death reached a form western
  consciences can process. Starvation photographs better than bombs or a
  sniper’s bullet in a child’s chest. Skeletal children evoke sympathy that
  crushed bodies never will. They can mourn our corpses without confronting the
  systems that created them. So, western nations can acceptably feign concern
  over famine in Gaza as if Palestinian mothers hadn’t been carrying their dying
  children to hospitals for over a year. And, suddenly politicians can offer
  conditional recognition of Palestinian statehood, but only if we promise to
  remain defenseless forever. They prefer us as martyrs because martyrs make no
  demands for liberation. This performative shift comes not from moral awakening
  but from calculated safety. Famine sounds like misfortune; genocide sounds
  like guilt. Famine lets them send aid without admitting harm, grieve publicly
  without calling out the inflictors. They can express horror while avoiding the
  truth that western bombs destroyed almost all of Gaza. Even when evidence
  becomes undeniable, they adapt. When photographs of 18-month-old Mohammed
  al-Mutawaq, skeletal from malnutrition, went viral, pro-Israeli voices found
  new ways to dismiss Palestinian suffering. Once it was revealed the child has
  cerebral palsy, columnists declared the starvation narrative “a lie”, calling
  such images “propaganda”. As if starving a child pre-disposed to death makes
  the violence more justified? But the New York Times, quick to factcheck a
  starving Palestinian child for having a pre-existing condition, let their
  Screams Without Words report go uncorrected for over 500 days, helping launch
  popular support for genocide. But Palestinian voices break through not despite
  the repression, but because of our refusal to accept that some stories cannot
  be told, some deaths cannot be mourned, some truths cannot be spoken. Those
  who remain breathing will speak the truth others died trying to tell: that
  Palestinian blood waters the earth of our homeland, that our resistance grows
  from every grave they dig, that our liberation cannot be delayed by their
  comfort with finishing the Nakba. If you want to listen to Palestinians now,
  respect our call: immediate sanctions on Israel, stop the sale and flow of
  weapons that continue to kill, and respect the Palestinian right to
  self-determination. The children at al-Shifa hospital understood what the
  world refuses to see. Many of them are probably buried now, killed by the same
  forces that dismissed their testimony as propaganda. And still, the only
  question their corpses might be asked is if they condemned Hamas before Israel
  killed them. Ahmad Ibsais is a first generation Palestinian American, law
