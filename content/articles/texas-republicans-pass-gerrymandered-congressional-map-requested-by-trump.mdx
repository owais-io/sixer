  The Republican-controlled Texas house on Wednesday approved a redrawn
  congressional map requested by Donald Trump and fiercely opposed by Democrats,
  who led a weeks-long protest to stall the effort that kicked off a
  coast-to-coast redistricting arms race between red and blue states. With the
  house’s approval, the measure next goes to the state senate, where it is
  expected to pass, possibly as soon as Thursday. It would then be sent to the
  state’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, for his promised signature before
  taking effect. “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on
  our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your
  Freedoms, and your Country, itself,” Trump gloated on social media. “Texas
  never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same
  thing.” The House vote capped a dramatic protest that began earlier this
  month, when a group of Democratic state lawmakers left Texas to delay a vote
  on the redistricting bill by denying a quorum in the House. They abandoned
  their exile this week, after the California legislature began advancing a
  redistricting bill to counter the Texas plan. Before the Texas House vote,
  Democratic state representatives filed a series of amendments to the bill, all
  of which were voted down by Republicans, but allowed the minority party to
  raise objections to the Republicans’ decision to take up redistricting before
  flood relief; to house rules which require a police escort when leaving the
  chamber; and to the proposal itself, a mid-decade change which Democrats argue
  reduces the voting power of people of color in service to Republican political
  gains and further gerrymanders the state at the cost of democracy. “We’re
  ready to meet Trump where he is, which is on a dirt road,” said Democrat
  Nicole Collier, livestreaming from a bathroom off the legislative floor, where
  she had been sleeping in protest since Monday. “We’re ready to get down and
  dirty.” Collier refused to sign what she called a “permission slip” and
  consent to a demand by Republican leaders that Democrats not be allowed to
  leave the chamber unless they agreed to have an around-the-clock police
  escort, and has been trapped in the chamber as a result. On a Zoom call with
  the Democratic senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and the Democratic National
  Committee chair, Ken Martin, Collier said she was being told she had to end
  the live stream or face a felony charge, abruptly leaving the meeting. It is
  emblematic of the unusual resistance Democrats in Texas have put up to the
  redistricting bill, and the response of the Republican-controlled Texas
  government to that resistance. “This bill intentionally discriminates against
  Black and Hispanic Texans and other Texans of color by cracking and packing
  minority communities across the state of Texas,“ said Chris Turner, a
  Democratic representative from Arlington. “It is a clear violation of the
  Voting Rights Act and the constitution.” Republican leaders rejected racial
  animus as an element of the redistricting, noting that it increases the number
  of districts with a Hispanic voting age majority from seven to eight. Based on
  voting results from 2024, five congressional seats would change party from
  Democratic to Republican under the new map, which they argue is legally
  allowed. “You want transparency,” said representative Todd Hunter, the Corpus
  Christi Republican who drafted the redistricting bill. “The underlying goal of
  this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance … We
  are allowed to draw congressional districts on the basis of political
  performance, as recognized by the US supreme court in Rucho v Common Cause.
  These districts were drawn primarily using political performance to guide the
  redrawing of districts.” The strong assertion that the genesis of the
  redistricting is about increasing the number of Republicans in Congress, and
  not to diminish the voting power of people of color, is an early defense to
  expected legal challenges to the proposal under the Voting Rights Act. “When
  you say the word ‘redistricting’, I think you know there are going to be legal
  challenges,” Hunter said. Under the Voting Rights Act and longstanding court
  precedent, lawmakers needed to draw lines with great awareness of the racial
  composition of the electorate, to avoid unconstitutionally packing them into
  single districts to reduce their influence on other districts, or to spread
  them across multiple districts – cracking – to dilute their voting strength as
  a group. Talk of a mid-decade redistricting began in Texas after the
  Department of Justice circulated a letter describing the use of race in the
  state’s 2021 redistricting to be unconstitutional. Texas’s governor, Greg
  Abbott, seized on this as a rationale to redraw district lines more
  advantageous to Republicans. Donald Trump has called for Texas and other
  states to redraw their lines for more partisan advantage, prompting
  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and other Democratic governors to begin
  to counter with redistricting of their own. The brazenness of Trump’s effort
  to boost Republican’s partisan advantage in next year’s midterm elections has
  triggered an equally aggressive response from Democrats – even among fierce
  opponents of political gerrymandering. On Tuesday, the California plan earned
  the support of former president Barack Obama, who said it was a “responsible”
  response to the Texas effort. The Democratic-led California legislature is
  scheduled to vote on Thursday morning on a suite of bills that would advance
  Newsom’s redistricting plan to “neutralize” Texas’s gerrymandering effort. The
  new California map, which must be approved by voters in a November special
  election, would only take effect if Texas or another Republican state moves
  forward with their mid-decade redistricting plan. “It’s on,” Newsom wrote on
  X, after the Texas House vote. Kathy Hochul, the Democratic governor of New
  York, who has also threatened to retaliate against Republican redistricting
  moves, was similarly defiant: “Game on.” In a setback for California
  Republicans hoping to thwart the effort, the state supreme court on Wednesday
  night declined their request to intervene. • This article was amended on 21
  August 2025. An earlier version said that Democratic lawmakers started their
  protest last month when in fact they started it earlier this month.
