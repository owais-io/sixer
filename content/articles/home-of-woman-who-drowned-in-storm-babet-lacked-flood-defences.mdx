  The home of an 83-year-old woman who drowned during Storm Babet did not have
  formal flood defences, an inquest has heard. Maureen Gilbert was found
  “floating in the water” in her home in Tapton Terrace in Chesterfield,
  Derbyshire, by her son on the morning of 21 October 2023. Gilbert was one of
  seven people who died as a result of Storm Babet, which caused thousands of
  homes to be without power across the UK. The inquest at Chesterfield coroner’s
  court heard that Gilbert died when the River Rother overflowed its banks.
  About 400 homes in the Chesterfield area were evacuated during the storm. Neil
  Longden, the Environment Agency operations manager for Yorkshire, told the
  inquest on Monday that Tapton Terrace where Gilbert resided was at a high risk
  of flooding due to several factors, including lying on low land and being at
  the point where multiple water sources come together. Despite this, the street
  was found to have no flood defences. When asked why, Longden said the “answer
  really is you can build something, but someone has to pay for it”. He added:
  “There is a feasible solution to the problem but funding, and potentially the
  planning process, may put that at risk.” Longden also told the court there are
  “thousands of people at flood risk” throughout Britain, and that you would
  “have that challenge in many locations around the country”. The court heard
  that a storage reservoir, a unit that can hold large amounts of water in case
  of flooding, was installed downstream of River Rother in 2018 to reduce the
  peak flow caused by heavy rainfall. Longden described Storm Babet as “one of
  the most significant storms” he had encountered and a “different type of storm
  than I have experienced before” because of the amount of rain. He told the
  court the storage reservoir was the “only significant step” taken to protect
  the area from flooding between 2007, when Chesterfield experienced intense
  flooding, and Storm Babet. Gilbert’s son, Paul Gilbert, attended the first day
  of the inquest. He told Sky News in 2023 that he had tried to secure his
  mother’s home with makeshift flood defences, which he had done for every flood
  warning since 2007, as residents feared an inundation, saying that “everybody
  on the street did as much as they could”. He told an interviewer at the time:
  “She lived on the street all her life. Rebuilding after the 2007 flood was
  hard for us and her but this is just devastating. We now only have memories as
  everything else is gone.” In the aftermath of Storm Babet Derbyshire police,
  whose officers responded to the flooding, referred themselves to the
  Independent Office for Police Conduct, which decided that the matter should be
  dealt with locally by the force. The inquest will continue on Tuesday and is
  expected to last five days.
