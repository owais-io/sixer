  Why does capital love fossil fuels? It’s not hard to explain. They exist in a
  small number of discrete locations, where the right to exploit them can be
  owned and monopolised. Most can be extracted commercially only at scale,
  excluding small competitors. They can be stored and traded all over the world,
  allowing prices to be optimised across time and space. Renewable energy, by
  contrast, can be generated almost anywhere, by almost anyone with a small
  amount of money to invest. Renewables might now be cheaper than fossil fuel in
  the vast majority of cases, but this makes them less attractive to capital,
  not more. Fossil fuels are uncompetitive and highly profitable. Renewables are
  highly competitive and not very profitable. As a result, fossil fuel
  extractors will fight tooth and nail to prevent market forces from operating.
  They demand the equivalent of the royal monopolies granted by the English
  Crown centuries ago, excluding competitors and enabling old technologies to
  fend off newer ones. Their enormous profits allow them to bend politics to
  their will, attacking and maligning their critics, sowing disinformation and
  denial and assisting the election of those who favour them. In Donald Trump,
  they have found the monarch who will grant them their exclusive charter. Over
  the past year, the Guardian’s reporters have documented the methods used by
  this industry to maintain its profits pipeline. These range from bankrolling
  Trump’s election to extract the brutal environmental rollbacks he has ordered
  on its behalf, to the unprecedented congressional lobbying campaign it has
  financed, to the funding of secretive junktanks and the financial fuelling of
  the far right – which channels, as it has done throughout its history, the
  demands of powerful corporations and oligarchs. Around the world, oil, gas and
  coal companies use an ever-widening set of tactics to crush competition and
  opposition, including lawsuits that seem designed to shut down environmental
  groups. Those who seek to defend the world from climate disaster and the
  tipping of Earth systems it could cause find themselves confronting a ruthless
  and deadly force. Perhaps the most powerful weapon in the hands of the fossil
  fuel companies is the media. The billionaire press has defended their
  interests at every turn. It remains the principal outlet for their denial,
  disinformation and delaying tactics. Some of its proprietors are heavily
  invested in fossil fuels. As a body, they belong to what one of their editors
  once called the “rich man’s trade union”: they perceive an attack on any
  aspect of rapacious capitalism as an attack on themselves. More than anything,
  we need media outlets not beholden to the fossil fuel companies; outlets that
  are prepared, despite the many financial and legal hazards, to resist this
  lucrative death cult. With no proprietor to appease, the Guardian’s reporters
  and commentators will continue to expose and document the machinations of this
  planet-killing industry. We rely on our readers to sustain our efforts. If
  you’re not already a Guardian supporter, please help us to keep fighting for
  the truth in a world of lies by backing our work today. Support the Guardian
  Join George Monbiot and special guests on 16 September for a special climate
  assembly to discuss the growing and dramatic political and corporate threats
  to the planet. Book tickets – in person or livestream
