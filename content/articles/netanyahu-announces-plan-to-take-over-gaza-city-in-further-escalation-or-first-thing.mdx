  Good morning. Israel’s security cabinet has approved a plan to take over Gaza
  City, the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has said, marking another
  escalation in the 22-month offensive that has killed tens of thousands of
  Palestinians, destroyed most of Gaza and pushed the territory into famine.
  Ahead of the security cabinet meeting, which began Thursday and ran through
  the night, Netanyahu had said Israel planned to retake control of the entire
  territory and eventually hand it off to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas.
  The announced plans stop short of that, perhaps reflecting the reservations of
  Israel’s top general, who reportedly warned it would endanger the remaining 20
  or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after
  nearly two years of regional wars. Many families of hostages are also opposed,
  fearing further escalation will doom their loved ones. If signed off by the
  full cabinet, what will the plan mean? It will involve sending ground troops
  into the city – one of the few areas of Gaza that has not been turned into an
  Israeli buffer zone or placed under evacuation orders. What has the reaction
  to the Israeli security cabinet’s decision been? It has ignited protests at
  home and abroad, and the UN has called for the plan to be “immediately
  halted”. Neo-Nazi leader sentenced to 20 years for plot to attack Maryland’s
  power grid The founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group has been sentenced to
  20 years in federal prison for planning an attack on Maryland’s power grid.
  Brandon Russell, 30, was convicted earlier this year for conspiring to plan
  the attack with his girlfriend. Prosecutors detailed his long-term links to
  white supremacist groups and his recent efforts to organize “sniper attacks”
  on electrical substations around Baltimore. The attack aimed to trigger
  societal collapse by targeting the energy infrastructure of the majority-Black
  city. What had Russell planned to do after the attack? Russell and his
  co-defendant, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, aimed to “create their own bizarre utopia
  populated by people who only look and think like they do”, according to the US
  district judge James Bredar. Trump says he will meet Putin despite Kremlin’s
