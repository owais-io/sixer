  Russian president Vladimir Putin hailed North Korean troops sent to fight in
  Ukraine as “heroic” in a letter to Kim Jong-un, North Korean state media
  reported on Friday. In a letter marking the anniversary of Korea’s liberation
  from Japanese rule, Putin recalled how Soviet Red Army units and North Korean
  forces fought together to end Japan’s colonial occupation. “The bonds of
  militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the
  days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,” Putin said in
  the letter revealed by North Korean state media. “This was fully proved by the
  heroic participation of the DPRK soldiers in liberating the territory of Kursk
  region from the Ukrainian occupationists,” he said, according to news agency
  KCNA, using the official name for North Korea. Earlier this year, Russian
  forces were engaged in a counteroffensive to eliminate the last of Kyiv’s
  positions in Russia’s Kursk region, in which Ukraine established a foothold
  last year. Russia and North Korea have been forging increasingly close ties,
  with the two countries signing a mutual defence pact last year, when Putin
  visited the reclusive state. In April, North Korea confirmed for the first
  time that it had deployed a contingent of its soldiers to the frontline in
  Ukraine, alongside Russian troops. South Korean and western intelligence
  agencies have said Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia’s Kursk
  region in 2024, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket
  systems. About 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed and thousands more
  wounded fighting for Russia, Seoul has said. South Korea’s intelligence agency
  said in June that North Korea was potentially ready to send more troops to
  Russia. The letter was delivered by the chair of Russia’s Duma – Vyacheslav
  Volodin – who met Kim during an official visit to Pyongyang on Thursday.
  Volodin thanked Kim for “dispatching excellent soldiers to the Kursk
  liberation operations for driving out the Ukrainian aggressors”, according to
  KCNA. He added that Russia would never forget the North Korean troops “who
  fought at the cost of their lives in Russia”. Putin held a phone call with Kim
  on Tuesday and updated him on planned talks with US president Donald Trump in
  Alaska on Friday, according to Russian officials. With Reuters and Agence
  France-Presse
