  Before Sex and the City, the cosmopolitan was just vodka, cranberry juice,
  Cointreau and lime juice. Afterwards it was a symbol of girlfriends, sex,
  flirting and freedom. But it wasn’t only the image of the pink cocktail that
  the show revolutionised. From the time it first aired in 1998, the show – and
  to a lesser extent its descendant, And Just Like That – has shaped the way we
  dress, eat, drink, date, exercise and work. What it did for the cosmo it also
  did for everything from nameplate necklaces to vibrators, catapulting them to
  pop-culture phenomenon status. “It was quite startling, the effect it had,”
  said Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, the author of Sex and the City and Us, which
  includes a chapter about SATC capitalism. “It even changed the way we brunch.
  Overnight, we all understood that you go to brunch with your girlfriends to
  talk explicitly about sex.” So what are the items that the SATC universe
  supercharged? Cosmopolitans “This was not a mainstream drink before,” said
  Armstrong. “But I think it will forever be a staple on cocktail menus because
  of SATC. It was the perfect drink for the show. It’s pink, so it reads as
  feminine, and it looks great on screen.” It might now be a drinks order that
  would raise a smirk with a well-seasoned bartender, but it still stands for
  more than the sum of its parts. Peloton When Big died of a heart attack after
  his 1,000th Peloton workout in the first episode of And Just Like That, it
  inextricably linked the brand to a moment of televisual tragedy. Peloton
  spokespeople were quick to point out that Big’s unhealthy lifestyle was to
  blame and not their bike. The company even put out a parody advert featuring
  Chris Noth, the actor who played Big, alive and healthy (which it removed
  after sexual assault allegations surfaced against him). But the cultural harm
  was perhaps already done. “I’m unsure if it was that exact moment, but I
  really don’t see/hear people talking about them as much as they used to,” said
  Stephen Leng, who runs the Instagram fan account SamanthaJonesPR. “Perhaps we
  all moved on after the pandemic, perhaps it was the cultural impact of Mr
  Big’s death.” Apple laptop Carrie Bradshaw’s laptop was a character unto
  itself, the screen upon which various sentences of her columns were written,
  generally crescendoing up to the phrase “I couldn’t help but wonder”.
  Armstrong got hers “essentially because of Carrie,” she said. “I remember
  getting my first Mac laptop and taking it to a park in the West Village to
  write and very much cosplaying Carrie.” Bradshaw’s laptop now resides in the
  Smithsonian. Nameplate necklaces They are now so synonymous with Bradshaw that
  to many they are known simply as “Carrie necklaces”, but the costume designer
  Patricia Field says in her book that she first spotted them on young Hispanic
  and African-American customers who came to her shop. Since criticised for
  culturally appropriating the necklace, she said in a 2023 interview: “Yes, I
  appropriated the name necklace from the multitude of young, gorgeous girls who
  were my customers in my shop. The name necklace always caught my eye, but I
  have always given the credit to them.” According to Leng, it is “one of the
  only fashion items that Carrie ever wore that was really accessible … They’re
  still sold all over the world”. Fendi Baguette bag Launched in 1997, a year
  before Bradshaw hit screens, this luxury handbag is now rarely mentioned
  without connection to the character. “It’s not a bag,” Bradshaw once corrected
  a thief trying to steal her from her. “It’s a Baguette.” Searches on
  secondhand retail sites prove there’s still appetite for vintage Baguettes,
  with Sarah Jessica Parker regularly wearing the bag, out of character, over
  the years. Cigarettes In some quarters and for all the damage they do,
  cigarettes seem to be back in fashion, and Bradshaw might well be one of the
  original smoking influencers, referenced along with James Dean or Audrey
  Hepburn. Often seen with a cigarette in hand – while writing, drinking or
  sitting on her stoop, Bradshaw’s smoking was a major plot point in early
  seasons, and the series won a 2001 award for accurate depiction of a nicotine
  addiction. Manolos Bradshaw’s feet were no stranger to Jimmy Choos and
  Christian Louboutins, but it was shoes by the Spanish-born, London-based
  designer Manolo Blahnik that really clicked, becoming a regular wardrobe
  choice and plot point. People took note. “Carrie’s complete obsession with
  them meant that I, a gay teenager growing up in rural Hampshire, knew that
  they were the shoe to covet,” said Leng. “Even now, I can spot a real one from
  a mile off.” There was the episode where Bradshaw took umbrage at having to
  take them off for a party, and another where she got mugged for some. Most
  famous perhaps is that she was proposed to via a pair of blue satin and brooch
  bejewelled Hangisi Manolo Blahnik pumps. The shoe went on to become one of the
  designer’s best-selling designs. The Rabbit The show is credited with bringing
  vibrators out of the shadows, ushering in a new era of sexual consumerism. The
  Rabbit first featured in an episode in 1998. The day after, people who worked
  at sex-toy shops reported queues around the block. SATC “had an absolutely
  insane effect on Rabbit vibrator sales,” said Armstrong. “This named the model
  and also made it feel more safe and normal to a lot of women, especially with
  the character of Charlotte being the one who got addicted, given that she was
  the most conservative of the group.” Post-it notes “I’m sorry, I can’t. Don’t
  hate me.” These are the words that will run through the head of SATC fans
  whenever they see a Post-it. Written by Bradshaw’s brief love interest Jack
  Berger, the actor Ron Livingston reportedly suffered the consequences of his
  avoidant breakup style in real life after the episode aired, having to hide
  from angry fans. Others have since noted that what in 2003 felt like an
  off-key way to end things feels “borderline romantic” in the 2020s era of
  ghosting. You can buy replicas on Etsy. Vivienne Westwood wedding dress
  Despite being jilted not quite at the altar wearing a Vivienne Westwood design
  in 2008, Bradshaw made the late British designer the go-to for anti-brides of
  a certain age. “The fact that Charli XCX wore a Viv dress for her extremely
  East London wedding earlier this summer shows the lasting impact that Carrie –
  running out of her wedding before whacking Big on the head with her bouquet –
  has had on the zeitgeist,” Leng said. “It’s possible Carrie’s gown did as much
  for the high-end wedding dress industry as Vera Wang achieved in her whole
  career.”
