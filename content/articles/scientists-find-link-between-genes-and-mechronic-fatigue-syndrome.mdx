  Scientists have found the first robust evidence that people’s genes affect
  their chances of developing myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue
  syndrome (ME/CFS), a mysterious and debilitating illness that has been
  neglected and dismissed for decades by many in the medical community. Early
  findings from the world’s largest study into the genetics of the condition
  pinpointed eight regions of the human genome that were substantially different
  in people with an ME/CFS diagnosis compared to those without the illness. The
  discovery suggests that several variants of genes commonly found in the
  population raise the risk of developing the illness, though many people will
  carry the variants and never acquire it. Prof Chris Ponting, an investigator
  on the DecodeME study at the University of Edinburgh, called the results “a
  wake-up call” that showed a person’s genetics could “tip the balance” on
  whether they would develop ME/CFS. “These provide the first robust evidence
  for genetic contributions to ME,” Ponting said. “There are many genetic
  variants that apply across the genome that predispose people to be diagnosed
  with ME.” More research is needed to develop diagnostic tests or screenings to
  identify people at high risk of ME/CFS. But scientists called the work a
  milestone that put the illness on an equal footing with other debilitating
  diseases and opened potential avenues for treatments. “This really adds
  validity and credibility for people with ME,” said Sonya Chowdhury, chief
  executive of Action for ME and a DecodeME co-investigator. “We know that many
  people have experienced comments like ‘ME is not real’. They’ve been to
  doctors and they’ve been disbelieved or told that it’s not a real illness.”
  Despite its long history, scientists understand very little about the causes
  of ME/CFS, though most patients report an infection before symptoms first
  appear. Typical symptoms include extreme tiredness, sleep problems, brain fog
  and a worsening of symptoms after physical or mental activities, known as
  post-exertional malaise, which can take weeks to recover from. It is estimated
  that 67 million people are affected by ME/CFS at an annual cost to the global
  economy of tens of billions of pounds. In the UK, the annual economic toll is
  calculated at more than £3bn. There is no test or cure for the illness. The
  DecodeME study, a collaboration between Edinburgh University, ME charities and
  patients, was launched in 2022 to explore whether genes play a role in who
  develops ME/CFS. For the latest work, researchers analysed 15,579 DNA samples
  from people with ME/CFS and compared them with more than 250,000 people
  without the illness. The eight genetic regions that stood out in people with
  ME/CFS contain genes involved in immune defences and the nervous system. It
  will take more work to unpick the biology, but some gene variants may make
  people more vulnerable to ME/CFS by compromising their ability to fight
  bacterial and viral infections. Another genetic difference seen in ME/CFS is
  known from people with chronic pain, a symptom that many with ME/CFS also
  experience. “Overall, what is happening here is the genetics align with how
  people with ME have described their illness,” Ponting said. Andy
  Devereux-Cooke, a DecodeMe co-investigator, said the findings would be huge
  for patients. “The vast majority of the patient population essentially has
  been abandoned in one way or another, by families, the government, the medical
  system,” he said. “This will be huge for the patient population. Even though
  it does not provide all the answers [and] it does not provide practical
  assistance, it is a welcome drop in the ocean towards turning the tide.” Among
  the many questions that remain is why ME/CFS affects far more women than men.
  Diagnoses are four times more common in women, but the study found no genetic
  explanation. Another question is whether long Covid overlaps with ME/CFS.
  While many symptoms are similar, the researchers found no genetic link between
  the two. “One of the key things we’re doing is enabling others to use their
  different approaches to ask and answer the same question,” said Ponting. Prof
  Anne McArdle, who studies ME/CFS at the University of Liverpool, said the
  results, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal,
  provided “a solid basis” for future work that would hopefully help accelerate
  the development of a treatment for the devastating illness. Dr Beata
  Godlewska, who studies ME/CFS at the University of Oxford, recently used
  magnetic resonance spectroscopy to scan the brains of people with ME/CFS and
  long Covid. Those with ME/CFS but not long Covid had high levels of lactate in
  the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that integrates information
  about effort and emotion. This points to disrupted energy metabolism in the
  brain, and impaired mitochondria, the battery-like structures that provide
  energy inside cells. Godlewska said “It’s a very sad fact that people with
  ME/CFS are still disbelieved and the disease has been so neglected, especially
  when it comes to research funding. Hopefully this study will come with a
  benefit of both fighting the stigma, and convincing research funders that this
  is a truly biological condition.” • This article was amended on 21 August 2025
  to clarify that DNA samples from 15,579 people with ME/CFS were compared with
  DNA from the control group of 250,000 people without the illness.
