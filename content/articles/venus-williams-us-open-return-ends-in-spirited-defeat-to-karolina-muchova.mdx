  On an unforgettable evening in New York, Venus Williams offered yet another
  demonstration of her perpetual greatness as she battled into the night with
  Karolína Muchová, making the 11th seed’s life difficult across an intense two
  hours before falling 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in the first round of the US Open. As
  Williams took the familiar walk through the bowels of Arthur Ashe Stadium and
  on to the court, the 45-year-old’s latest appearance at her home grand slam
  tournament occurred on a notable date. On 25 August 1997, exactly 28 years
  ago, this stadium opened for the first time. Later that day, a 17-year-old
  Williams was one of the first players to compete on the court as she made her
  long-awaited US Open debut there, the start of her monumental run to the
  final. So much has changed in the three decades Williams has spent playing
  professional tennis, yet at 45 years old her passion for the sport is
  undimmed. Here she was again, just as determined to give her all. She found
  herself in a difficult match up against the 11th seed Muchová, a semi-finalist
  last year. Things have not been easy for Muchová recently and she is still
  trying to find her form after a left wrist injury that sidelined her for
  months but she is one of the most talented players in the sport. Despite a
  full crowd inside the biggest tennis stadium in the world, the opening games
  played out to an awkward silence due to Williams’ unforced errors. She looked
  more than a step slow to every ball and her timing was off. Down 0-2, 0-40,
  things looked grim. Then, suddenly, Williams came to life. She found
  destructive first serves and eviscerated the ball off both wings, pinning
  Muchová far behind the baseline and putting her under relentless pressure. She
  kept on moving forward, always looking for opportunities to snatch a trademark
  drive volley out of the air. Every successful point was punctuated by a roar
  from the New York crowd, which did not always support her during her prime
  years. Even though her second serve betrayed her towards the end of the first
  set, Williams entered the second emboldened by how her game measured up
  against one of the best players in the world, and she performed at a brilliant
  level. With age, certain parts of her game have naturally deteriorated, but
  the fundamentals endure: big serving, relentless, attacking shotmaking and her
  determination to close down the net. Muchová eventually recovered in the final
  set, forcing Williams into defensive positions more frequently as she closed
  out the win. Afterwards, Williams expressed pride at her performance and she
  felt her inability to maintain her strong level due to her lack of recent
  match practise. “I love playing,” she said. “The level of my game has come up
  so much since [last month]. I tried as hard as I could to throw off any rust,
  but at the end of the day, there’s only so much that can really be
  accomplished in three or four matches. There were just some shots I missed –
  those kind of shots are about feel and less about training, and those are the
  kinds of things that I just couldn’t stave off today.” When Williams first
  announced her return, many people were sceptical about whether the 45-year-old
  could be competitive with elite tennis players. After such a positive
  performance, the majority of Williams’s press conference focused on whether
  she would actually be willing to compete more frequently. Williams does not
  intend to play after the US Open or outside the United States but she has not
  ruled out competing next year. “Are there any tournaments in the States? Can
  someone move a tournament here? I don’t know that I’m willing to travel that
  far at this stage in my career to go play,” she said. Williams recently
  revealed that she has struggled with fibroids for many years, tumours that
  develop in and around the uterus causing significant pain and heavy bleeding,
  which has had a significant impact on her playing career. Her health problems
  made this particular match-up even more symbolic. “When I think about the
  match I played against [Muchová] in 2020, I was so uncomfortable,” said
  Williams. “I wasn’t well. I was in so much pain. Today it’s night and day how
  much better I felt, so I’m so grateful to have had the opportunity to play in
  feeling better, and at that rate, have a real chance.” Last year, Williams
  underwent an open myomectomy surgery to remove the fibroids, a major surgery
  that was the source of significant concern for her beforehand. Part of her
  motivation for continuing to compete at her advanced age was simply being able
  to experience playing the sport she loves without being in pain. “What did I
  prove to myself? I think for me getting back on the court was about giving
  myself a chance to play more healthy. When you play unhealthy, it’s in your
  mind. It’s not just how you feel. You get stuck in your mind too,” said
  Williams, her eyes welling up with tears. “So … it was nice to be freer.”
