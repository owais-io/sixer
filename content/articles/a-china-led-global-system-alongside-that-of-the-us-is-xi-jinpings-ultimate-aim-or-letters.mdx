  I enjoyed reading George Magnus’s article (Why Peak China may finally have
  arrived, 11 August). However, focusing on peak economic growth misses the
  bigger picture and underestimates China in ways that could weaken western
  policy responses. China’s central goal is national power, and we are far from
  its peak national power. The Chinese economic miracle has taken place under
  the US-led global system. China built factories along its coast, filled
  container ships, and sent its goods to developed markets, effectively plugging
  into an existing network of shipping routes, ports and railways. However, just
  as easily as China joined this system, so too can it be forcefully unplugged.
  This is a core national security concern and, for more than a decade, China
  has been building an alternative to this US-led order. The belt and road
  initiative has created new trading networks across the global south; the
  Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (Cips) allows China and its partners to
  move money beyond the gaze of the US government; the “Made in China 2025”
  policy has established China as a global leader in science and technology; and
  the modernisation of its military will allow China to project power beyond its
  borders. On his first and only visit to the US since the pandemic, Xi Jinping
  declared to Joe Biden that “Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries
  to succeed”. Policymakers should understand this as a statement of intent.
  Even with slower growth, the party commands enough of the nation’s wealth and
  resources to pursue its ultimate aim: a parallel, China-led global system.
