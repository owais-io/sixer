  the situation’ for ending war

  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia refusing to accept a ceasefire was
  complicating efforts to end Moscow’s more than three-year-long conflict, after
  a summit between the US and Russian presidents yielded no deal on ending the
  war: “We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not
  yet determined when it will stop the killing. This complicates the situation,”
  Zelenskyy said in a social media post late Saturday. “If they lack the will to
  carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to
  get Russia to have the will to implement far greater – peaceful coexistence
  with its neighbors for decades.” Trump has said that he had agreed with Putin
  that a peace deal should be sought without the prior ceasefire that Ukraine
  and its European allies, until now with US support, have demanded. Ukrainian
  and European leaders fear that a straight-to-peace deal, skipping over a
  preliminary ceasefire, gives Moscow an upper hand in talks. After his meeting
  with Vladimir Putin on Friday, Donald Trump told European leaders that he
  supported a plan to end the Ukraine-Russia war by ceding unconquered land to
  Russia, the New York Times reported, citing two senior European officials. The
  officials said Trump will discuss the plan with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday
  when the Ukrainian president visits the White House, adding that European
  leaders have been invited to join. Trump earlier said that Kyiv should make a
  deal with Moscow because “Russia is a very big power, and they’re not.”
  European officials will decide this weekend whether Zelenskyy will be
  accompanied on the visit to Washington, German foreign minister Johann
  Wadephul said on Saturday. European leaders, including Macron, Merz and
  Starmer, are set to discuss the issues with Zelenskyy on Sunday via video call
  ahead of his meeting with Trump, the French president’s office said in a
  statement. A joint statement issued by European leaders said they were “ready
  to work with US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy towards a
  trilateral summit with European support” but “it will be up to Ukraine to make
  decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by
  force.” The leaders of eight Nordic-Baltic nations said on Saturday that they
  remain steadfast in their support for Ukraine and to the efforts by Trump to
  end the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The leaders of Denmark, Estonia,
  Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said in a statement
  that achieving peace between Ukraine and Russia requires a ceasefire and
  security guarantees for Ukraine: “We welcome President Trump’s statement that
  the US is prepared to participate in security guarantees. No limitations
  should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with other
  countries,” the statement said. At the Alaska summit, Putin demanded Ukraine
  withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk as a condition for ending the war, but
  offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline, two sources with direct
  knowledge of the talks told the Guardian. Although Luhansk is almost entirely
  under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key parts of Donetsk, including the
  cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk and heavily fortified positions whose
  defence has cost tens of thousands of lives. Eight pages of US government
  planning documents for the summit meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir
  Putin were left in a hotel printer in Anchorage before the meeting on Friday,
  NPR reported. The documents, which were posted online by NPR, appear to have
  been produced by Trump administration officials in charge of summit planning
  and included the precise locations and times for the scheduled meetings, as
  well the phone numbers of US government employees. Canadian prime minister
  Mark Carney welcomed what he said was US openness to providing security
  guarantees to Ukraine under a peace deal to end Russia’s war against Kyiv.
  “Robust and credible security guarantees are essential to any just and lasting
  peace. I welcome the openness of the United States to providing security
  guarantees as part of Coalition of the Willing’s efforts,” Carney said in a
  statement. Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from first lady
  Melania Trump to Russian leader Vladimir Putin raising the plight of Ukrainian
  and Russian children caught in the middle of the ongoing war between the two
  European countries, it was reported on Saturday. The contents of the letter
  were unknown – but two Trump administration officials told Reuters that it
  mentioned the abductions of children resulting from the war that broke out
  after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. However, the text of the letter, which
  was obtained and posted online by Fox News on Saturday, is extremely opaque
  and makes no reference at all to the abductions or transfer of children from
  Russian-occupied Ukraine to Russia. Vladimir Putin has said that his visit to
  Alaska was “useful and timely”, the Russian news agency Tass reported on
  Saturday. Putin also added that his conversation with Trump was “sincere and
  substantive”, adding that Russia respects the position of the US and also
  wants to settle the Ukrainian conflict peacefully. Russian foreign minister
  Sergei Lavrov held calls on Saturday with his Turkish and Hungarian
  counterparts, the Russian foreign ministry said. The phone call between Lavrov
  and Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan took place at Turkey’s initiative,
  the Russian foreign ministry said, and exchanged views on the Russia-US
  meeting, without elaborating further. The Ukrainian military said it had
  pushed Russian forces back by about 2km (1.2 miles) on part of the Sumy front
  in northern Ukraine. There was no immediate comment from Russia, which
  controls a little over 200 sq km in the region, according to Ukraine’s
  battlefield mapping project DeepState.
