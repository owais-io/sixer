  a credible source of information’

  Donald Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner Erika
  McEntarfer, a veteran economist with decades of experience inside the federal
  government, after claiming without evidence that official jobs data had been
  “rigged” against him. In her place, the US president has lined up an ardent
  supporter of his agenda accused of regularly misrepresenting and exaggerating
  statistics, who previously urged Trump’s officials to “take a chainsaw” to the
  agency he has been tapped to oversee. EJ Antoni, an economist at the Heritage
  Foundation and contributor to Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint drawn up
  ahead of Trump’s re-election, has been nominated by the president to take
  charge of US government labor statistics. He did not respond to a request for
  comment. McEntarfer’s abrupt dismissal had already raised fears in Washington,
  on Wall Street and far beyond about the integrity of official US government
  data. Plans to replace her with Antoni – confirmed hours after he had called
  on the BLS to halt the publication of monthly jobs data – have only heightened
  concern among leading economists. “From selectively presenting data from
  particularly convenient dates to misrepresenting axes to exaggerate
  magnitudes, he has used all the tricks in the book and shown time and again
  that he is not a credible source of information,” Dave Hebert, an economist at
  the American Institute for Economic Research, a conservative thinktank, told
  the Guardian. “Worse, he has repeatedly shown that he fundamentally
  misunderstands what some of the data the BLS puts out actually means. “It’s
  difficult to imagine someone effectively leading a vital organization like the
  BLS who cannot correctly define the data they’re putting out.” After July’s
  lackluster jobs report, there have been further signs of economic strain under
  Trump. On Thursday, the producer price index – which measures wholesale
  inflation – was revealed to have risen 0.9% in July, markedly more than
  expected, and the biggest monthly increase in three years. But data released
  under Antoni – who requires confirmation by the US Senate – won’t be believed,
  according to Hebert. “I have no problem with someone who supports President
  Trump, but we cannot afford such a partisan person who has neither the
  credibility nor the ability to generate believable data,” he added. Antoni was
  pictured in a crowd of Trump supporters outside the Capitol during the January
  6 insurrection in 2021. The White House told NBC News he was just a bystander,
  in town for meetings. He is a prolific user of social media, and has
  frequently appeared on Fox News, Newsmax and other conservative outlets to
  promote Trump’s policies and arguments. In July 2024, Antoni quoted a post on
  X, formerly Twitter, which seemingly claimed the 2020 election was stolen. He
  has also derided the Federal Reserve; called social security, Medicare and
  Medicaid “Ponzi schemes”; and frequently cast aspersions on the BLS, which he
  is now set to lead, joking that the “L” is “silent”. Back in March, he called
  10,000 federal government job losses “a fabulous start”. Responding to a
  September 2023 article by ZeroHedge, a libertarian and conspiracy theory
  website, about US men going abroad to find wives, Antoni wrote in a post:
  “Shortages in domestic markets always encourage imports. The laws of Supply
  and Demand will not be conned, not in any aspect of life.” In recent days,
  Antoni has also stirred controversy online after viewers noticed a painting of
  a Nazi battleship featured in some of his broadcast interviews. In a 2023
  podcast interview with TFTC, Antoni confirmed the painting to be the Bismarck,
  used by Nazi Germany’s Kriegsmarine during the second world war. Upon being
  asked about the painting, he replied: “The Bismarck, yep, in all his glory.”
  But it is Antoni’s use of official data that has drawn the most ire among
  other economists, who have suggested he mischaracterized BLS data about
  multiple job holders and native-born and foreign-born workers. He has also
  tried to frame previous revisions by the bureau as part of a Democratic
  conspiracy under Biden. Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”
  “needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS”, Antoni wrote on X in November. Shortly
  before his nomination to lead the bureau this week, he told Fox News the
  monthly jobs report should be paused over claims its data is flawed. The White
  House has since claimed “the plan” is to continue publishing the closely
  watched report. “He’s utterly unqualified and as partisan as it gets,” Stan
  Veuger, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute,
  told the Washington Post. Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the conservative
  thinktank the Manhattan Institute, has previously criticized Antoni for
  claiming that unemployment rate had been “artificially” reduced. “This is one
  of the many elementary errors that show me Mr Antoni is unqualified for the
  labor market data collection and analysis role he was nominated to,” Di
  Martino wrote on social media this week. “People will discuss credentials but
  what matters is whether you know what you’re talking about.” Friends of BLS, a
  group co-chaired by William Beach, who served as BLS commissioner during
  Trump’s first term, has urged the Senate to do its due diligence in assessing
  Antoni’s suitability for the role. “The unwarranted dismissal of Dr Erika
  McEntarfer, the 16th Commissioner of Labor Statistics, and the baseless
  characterization of BLS employment estimates as ’fake’ and ‘rigged’ have
  undermined public trust in the Bureau’s integrity and the usefulness of its
  statistics,” the group wrote. “The next Commissioner must not only manage the
  difficult responsibilities inherent to the role, but also restore public
  trust, defend the agency against political interference, and accelerate
  critical modernization efforts across all programs.” The White House did not
  immediately respond to requests for comment.
