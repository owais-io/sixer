  According to data compiled by an insurance firm, nearly two in every five
  mobile phones stolen in Europe are taken in the UK. Claims made to the
  American insurance company SquareTrade showed 39% of all phone thefts across
  the company’s 12 European markets were in Britain. The data revealed that
  phone theft claims in the UK had increased by 425% since June 2021 and 42% of
  phone thefts in the UK occurred in London. We’d like to hear from people who
  have been the victim of phone theft in the UK in the last six months? Has your
  phone been snatched out of your hands? What happened next and how easy was it
  to secure your data and accounts? Did you report it to the police? Has it
  changed your behaviour using your phone or sense of safety on the streets? Why
  do you think that the UK is the phone theft capital of Europe.
