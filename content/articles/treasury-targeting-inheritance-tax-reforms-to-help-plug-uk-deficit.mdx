  The Treasury is looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax amid
  growing pressure on the country’s finances ahead of the autumn budget, sources
  have told the Guardian. Officials have been tasked with examining whether
  tightening rules on the gifting of money and assets could be one way of
  addressing a gap between revenue and spending that is estimated to reach more
  than £40bn. Although no decisions have been taken, the government has been
  careful not to rule out tax rises later this year amid slowing economic
  growth, higher-than-hoped inflation and unemployment at a four-year high.
  Labour MPs have been pushing the idea of a wealth tax, but changes to
  inheritance tax (IHT) thresholds could be similarly controversial. Rachel
  Reeves and Keir Starmer have already prepared the ground for tax rises in
  recent interviews, suggesting that the pressure on public finances is too
  great to rule them out. However, the government’s pledge not to increase taxes
  on “working people” in its election manifesto has left the chancellor with
  limited options for how to tackle a yawning deficit caused by factors
  including Donald Trump’s tariffs, higher debt interest payments and a series
  of U-turns on welfare cuts. Among the moves being considered are changes to
  how wealth or assets can be given away prior to death to reduce inheritance
  tax liabilities. This includes examining the possibility of a cap on lifetime
  gifting. At present, gifts made seven years before someone dies are not
  subject to IHT, while those given three to seven years before death are taxed
  on a sliding scale known as “taper relief”, with the rate reducing each year
  from 32% to 8%. A lifetime cap could be introduced to limit the amount of
  money or value of assets an individual can donate as part of their IHT
  planning and the Treasury is also reviewing rules around the taper rate,
  people familiar with the matter said. A source with knowledge of the work told
  the Guardian: “With so much wealth stored in assets like houses that have shot
  up in value, we have to find ways to better tap into the inheritances of those
  who can afford to contribute more. “It’s hard to make sure these taxes don’t
  end up with loopholes that undermine their purpose. But we are trying to work
  out what revenue might be raised and how to ensure it’s a fair approach.” The
  source added: “IHT can raise more, and even if we do nothing, it will raise
  more money as the threshold for paying it stays frozen. But we have to look at
  the levers for taxing wealth if the aim of the government is to avoid hitting
  earnings from work as much as possible.” IHT changes have provoked a strong
  public response in the past, even though fewer than one in 20 estates paid it
  in recent years. In the late 2000s the Conservatives enjoyed a significant
  swing in opinion polls when they proposed raising the threshold at which IHT
  would kick in. As party leader David Cameron made it a hot-button issue,
  putting pressure on the Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, with headlines
  about the “death tax”. Reeves has faced fierce criticism and protests over the
  past year in response to her decision in last autumn’s budget to cut tax
  breaks for farmers passing on their businesses. She defended her decision on
  Tuesday in an interview in Northern Ireland, saying she believed that those
  farmers with more than £3m to pass on “should make a contribution” and that
  they would still continue to pay a lower rate of IHT than others. Only 4.6% of
  deaths resulted in IHT being paid in the tax year 2022-23, according to the
  latest figures from HMRC. The average effective tax rate was 13%, after
  accounting for all the different reliefs and exemptions that might apply
  depending on the individual circumstances. That compares with the headline
  rate of 40%. The government is trying to work out how it can tap into the vast
  wave of wealth that will be transferred from baby boomers when they die,
  fuelled by large pension pots, as well as house prices that have risen sharply
  over their lifetimes. It already took steps to bring these pensions into the
  scope of IHT late last year. From April 2027, most unused pension pots and
  death benefits will be subject to the tax. This leaves large loopholes,
  however, if sums are withdrawn and gifted instead, and officials are
  increasingly concerned about large cash sums being extracted from these pots.
  Another possible revenue stream being looked at is whether to increase capital
  gains tax rates by a few percentage points. However, this would be accompanied
  by some kind of CGT allowance for investors who put money into British
  businesses, as the Treasury tries to strike a balance between tapping into
  wealth to fund public services without deterring investment into the UK. There
  is growing anecdotal evidence that some wealthy people and company directors
  may have already left the UK following recent tax changes, including the end
  of the “non-dom” status, though no official data is yet available. The
  Guardian was first to reveal that the government was considering major changes
  to business property relief and agricultural land tax in 2024, a step later
  brought in by Reeves. These changes may have a significant impact on how much
  money is raised by IHT, but it is unclear how they might alter behaviour. In
  2024 CGT rates were not raised as high as many senior Labour party figures had
  hoped, with the government stepping back from bringing the levy closer to
  levels of income tax. Still, some senior government figures believe that there
  is a political deal to be done to create a path towards equalising its levels
  with income tax. They believe there is room for a compromise after Reeves
  signalled that a flat-rate wealth tax – of the kind proposed by backbenchers
  last month, of 2% on assets over £10m – had more or less been ruled out. In a
  recent interview, Reeves pointed to IHT and CGT as the UK alternatives to a
  headline wealth tax such as that in countries like Switzerland. “We have
  inheritance tax. We have capital gains. We’ve just got rid of the non-dom tax
  status that doesn’t exist any more in our tax system. So we do have taxes that
  tax the wealthy,” she told LBC’s Iain Dale on 2 August. “I’m not keen to do
  what Switzerland has done and replace those with a wealth tax because I think
  there’s the risk of actually losing money by doing those things.” A Treasury
  spokesperson said: “As set out in the plan for change, the best way to
  strengthen public finances is by growing the economy – which is our focus.
  Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen
  with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by £6.8bn
  and cut borrowing by £3.4bn. “We are committed to keeping taxes for working
  people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn’s budget we protected
  working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher
  or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.”
