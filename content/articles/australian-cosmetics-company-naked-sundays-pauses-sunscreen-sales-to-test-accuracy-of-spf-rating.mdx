  Australian sunscreen and cosmetics company Naked Sundays says it has paused
  sales of one of its products, pending further testing to determine if its sun
  protection factor (SPF) claims are accurate. The company on Monday published a
  statement on its website saying it had stopped selling its SPF50+ Collagen
  Glow Mineral Sunscreen in Australia “out of precaution” until it received
  additional test results. Naked Sundays’ announcement came three days after
  another Australian brand, Ultra Violette, said it would immediately pull its
  Lean Screen Skinscreen product from shelves after tests found a “pattern of
  inconsistency” in its SPF results. The Australian sunscreen industry and its
  regulation have been in the spotlight since June, when consumer advocacy group
  Choice published the results of an investigation into the SPF claims of
  popular brands. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Choice said it tested 20
  popular SPF 50 or 50+ sunscreens from a range of retailers in a specialised,
  accredited laboratory and found 16 products did not meet their SPF claims. In
  Choice’s test, the Ultra Violette Lean Screen SPF 50+ Mattifying Zinc Skin
  Screen, a higher-end product that retails for upwards of $50, returned an SPF
  result of just four. A second test returned a result of five, Choice said. The
  consumer organisation did not test any Naked Sundays products. The chief
  executive of Choice, Ashley de Silva, said it was clear there was a serious
  problem in the Australian sunscreen industry that urgently needed to be
  addressed. De Silva urged the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to look
  into other sunscreens using similar formulations as part of its investigation,
  launched after the Choice tests were published, into testing methods and
  regulations in the sector. “Choice is calling on any other brand that has
  reason to believe their products might also be affected to assess the risk
  their products are not providing the claimed SPF protection, and if necessary,
  remove their products from sale immediately,” De Silva said. Naked Sundays on
  Monday suggested it had been carrying out additional checks on its products
  since the Choice investigation came out. “For the past few months we have
  taken proactive action behind the scenes, by doing our own due diligence [and]
  additional SPF testing across multiple independent labs,” the company said in
  the statement. Naked Sundays said it had received a “large number” of customer
  inquiries about its Collagen Glow Mineral sunscreen in particular. It said it
  would not disclose its manufacturing partners due to confidentiality
  agreements but that the product was made at “multiple manufacturers” in
  Australia and the US. Naked Sundays said the US version of the product had
  already been retested and met the SPF50 claim advertised on the bottle, and
  that it planned to sell that version in Australia. “Till then we’ve paused the
  mineral [sunscreen] from sale in Australia out of precaution, while we await
  new, complete independent SPF results, and subsequent guidance from the TGA on
  their investigation into SPF testing,” it said. As part of its review of
  existing SPF regulations, the TGA has said it is exploring alternative test
  methods that may be more reliable. These include in vitro testing methods, in
  which sunscreen is tested on human skin deliberately exposed to UV radiation,
  which the TGA said could produce less variable results than the current
  standard practice. Naked Sundays said the “pause” only related to the Collagen
  Glow Mineral sunscreen and none of its other products were affected. The brand
  is stocked at leading beauty retailer Mecca, while Ultra Violette products are
  stocked at rival Sephora. Mecca confirmed in a statement on Monday that it was
  removing all sizes of the SPF50+ Collagen Glow 100% Mineral Perfecting Priming
  Lotion from sale, effective immediately. Mecca said it had made the decision
  jointly with Naked Sundays “while the brand awaits independent retesting of
  one of its manufacturing facilities to determine whether the product performs
  as advertised”. It offered customers a full refund on the product, and said no
  others from the brand were affected. Guardian Australia also contacted Sephora
  for comment.
