  In my youth, I secretly harboured a dream of swimming the Channel. When I was
  20, I worked as a lifeguard and swimming teacher at the council-run swimming
  pool in Cambridge. There were some intriguing regulars. Prof Stephen Hawking
  would watch poolside as his nephews swam. There was also a smattering of
  ex-Olympic swimmers, including a Maltese guy who moved through the water with
  such precision and power that he barely made a ripple. Watching him was
  hypnotic. One of the city’s swimming club coaches had competed at the Munich
  Olympics. I confided in her that I planned to swim the Channel. I knew it
  would take at least two or three years of hard training, I told her, but I was
  committed and time was on my side – I was only 21. She looked me up and down
  and told me that there were not enough geese in the world to render the fat
  required to insulate my skinny legs from 12 cold hours in the Channel. “Find
  another dream,” she said. Her comment stung. My family had famously scrawny
  legs: straw-thin and devoid of any tactical muscle. They were legs destined to
  reside in perpetuity beneath the troglodyte darkness of an office desk, not
  power through the seas to cross-Channel glory. Despite this, I’d always been a
  strong swimmer at school and later swam anywhere I could: freezing mountain
  lakes near my village in Snowdonia, rivers, pools, ponds and quarries. Bodies
  of water drew me towards them with magnetic power. It was the 1980s, when wild
  swimming was known only as “swimming” and Dryrobes wouldn’t bring warmth and
  derision for another three decades. I was strong but wiry, like a steel coat
  hanger, a racing snake. I wasn’t built for long-distance open-water swims. To
  swim distances, you need a degree of body fat density, buoyancy and power. I
  had none of this. For years, I chomped my way through peanut butter and banana
  sandwiches, protein shakes and ice-cream in the hope of achieving the bulk
  needed to stave off the cold. I could swim three miles in cold water before I
  started to freeze and shut down. No matter how hard I tried, I seemingly could
  not get past this distance barrier. Any fat I managed to lay down was burned
  off instantly with my constant training. I realised the swim coach was
  probably right, and I let my dream sink into the abyss. But what I couldn’t
  have known was what would take its place – and how rewarding it would be.
  Around this time, the city council decided that it would offer special
  closed-session swimming lessons to small groups of adults who wanted to learn
  but had a crushing fear of water. It was decided by the pool manager that I
  would run the class on Tuesday nights. I thought this was a nod to my
  expertise and maturity, but it just turned out that nobody else wanted to do
  it. My first group consisted of six adults of varying ages; the youngest was
  23, the oldest 79. During the first session, we sat on the poolside and talked
  about their experiences. Flora, the oldest, had a lifelong desire to learn but
  had never had the opportunity; work and family had consumed her life (nobody
  in her family apart from her grandchildren could swim). Many of them had lived
  through traumatic childhood incidents – one had been pushed into a river,
  another had been humiliated during a family seaside holiday. It requires real
  courage to share your fear and shame with a stranger, and learning to swim
  also requires you to undress, all your vulnerabilities shrink-wrapped into a
  singular experience. For that reason, there were no spectators. During those
  evening sessions, the pool was silent and still, the lights to the spectator
  gallery dimmed, the building transformed into a temple of tranquillity. By
  week three, everybody was standing waist-deep in the shallow end of the pool.
  The challenge was to walk across the 10 metres to the other side, hands
  clamped to a swim float that I was holding. The tiles underfoot were slippery
  and losing balance was easy. The last to go was a guy named Raj. He was twice
  my size and his desire to learn to swim was driven by a need to conquer a fear
  that had plagued him since childhood. He was dreading this exercise more than
  anyone else. By week seven, he was swimming, float held in front, legs
  furiously churning water. Week after week I had assured them that one day they
  would jump into the deep end and swim a full length of the pool, unaided by
  floats. Nobody believed this was possible; most only wanted to be able to
  float and tread water. I loved these sessions. Watching somebody slowly
  overcome a long-ingrained fear was deeply gratifying. By summer, I had
  migrated the class to a nearby outdoor pool, a staggeringly beautiful 100-yard
  lido surrounded by trees. The cold water was a shock but soon the realisation
  that they were away from the calm, safe privacy of the indoor pool hit them:
  they were out in the world doing something they could never have imagined
  themselves doing. It was glorious. I taught this class for a year before
  leaving to enrol at college as a mature 23-year-old. I like to think the
  course was a success and that the council continued with it, but sadly, a year
  later the pool was partially demolished and a smaller pool built, run by a
  private contractor. It had all the charm of a shopping-centre gym and there
  didn’t seem to be any classes for people who had sat too long on the riverbank
  watching and dreaming. At its most basic, swimming is about breathing and
  floating. The rest is just style. If you were lucky enough to learn as a kid,
  then great; lots of people didn’t get that opportunity to experience the
  amniotic weightlessness of being in a blue rectangle of water, or feel their
  toes brush along the pebbled bottom of a slow-moving river. The hard work and
  willpower it took my class to overcome something so debilitating for such a
  simple reward stayed with me for the rest of my life. None of them were ever
  going to swim the Channel, but of course, I never told them that. Gareth
