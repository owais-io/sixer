  The Kardashians want to monetize your chin If you’ve got $48 and a burning
  desire to look like you’ve just had major jaw surgery, then you’re in luck!
  Kim Kardashian’s shapewear brand Skims has just come out with a contraption
  called the Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap, which it describes as its “first-ever
  face innovation”. It’s essentially a piece of Velcro that goes around your
  face to provide what the marketing copy describes as “targeted compression for
  shaping &amp; sculpting” via “collagen yarn”. No, I don’t know what that means
  either. While I may be a tad unclear on how “collagen yarn” is supposed to
  work, I can tell you exactly how the Kardashian-Jenners operate: if there’s an
  insecurity that can be monetized, they’ll find a way to monetize it. Over the
  years the reality-TV-famous family have built an empire flogging everything
  from dubious detox teas to skincare products while posting heavily edited
  images that reinforce toxic beauty standards. The new face wrap appears to be
  an attempt to cash in on growing interest around what has been dubbed a
  “snatched jawline” – which is essentially a very chiselled jaw. A number of
  dubious products, including jaw massagers and “mastic chewing gum”, have
  popped up, promising to help you achieve this look. Now Skims has come out
  with its own exciting face innovation to get into the action. The
  medical-looking Face Wrap also seems to play into the way in which plastic
  surgery has become normalized. Celebrities used to be fairly hush-hush about
  going under the knife. Now they’re spilling all the details about which doctor
  they went to for their procedures and how much it cost. One surgeon told
  People magazine that the public is starting to see plastic surgery as just
  “another form of self-care”. While Skims’ new face wrap may scream “useless
  gimmick that promotes unhealthy beauty ideals”, it has already sold out and
  generated one unusual celebrity endorsement. In an Instagram video posted on
  Thursday Anthony Hopkins sported one of the Skims masks and jokingly slipped
  back into his Silence of the Lambs character, “the late, great Hannibal
  Lecter”, who wore a similar chinstrap in the film to curb his cannibalism.
  “Hello Kim, I’m already feeling 10 years younger,” Hopkins says. In a caption
  he added: “Don’t be afraid to come over for dinner.” Also chiming in on all
  the Skims chatter is Katie Piper, a model and TV presenter who was the victim
  of an acid attack in 2008 orchestrated by her ex-boyfriend. In a TikTok posted
  on Friday Piper said that the Kardashians’ “latest offering” reminded of her
  what she had to wear during her burn survivor recovery. “Please, people, don’t
  imprison your face in this contraption,” Piper says. “Don’t be so cruel and
  unkind to your face … to encase it in a stupid strap that, by the way, does
  absolutely nothing.” Amen to that. While it may be obvious, it’s worth
  reiterating that the Kardashians and other celebrities don’t look the way that
  they do because they strap medieval-looking torture devices around their faces
  while they sleep. Rather they shell out for expensive procedures like $100,000
  deep plane facelifts and $500,000 facial rejuvenations. In 2023 Sharon
  Osbourne told the Telegraph that while she hadn’t kept a running total of how
  much she had spent on cosmetic surgery, “it must top more than a million.” You
  can buy whatever sort of body you desire these days – it’ll just cost you an
  arm and a leg. Anti-abortion Texas Republican accused of paying for abortions
  The Republican state representative Giovanni Capriglione played an
  instrumental part in ensuring Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion
  laws in the US. Now a former adult entertainer called Alex Grace has claimed
  that she was romantically involved with Capriglione – who is married with kids
  – for almost two decades and he “funded several abortions for his own personal
  gain”. (There are some other extremely disgusting allegations involving cookie
  batter that I won’t repeat.) Capriglione has admitted to having an affair but
  says the rest of the story is lies. While I can’t confirm this particular
  case, there are plenty of other documented instances of anti-abortion
  extremists funding abortions for their mistresses. Elon Musk reposts tweet
  claiming women were ‘built to be traded to another tribe’ Meanwhile, Donald
  Trump has been banging on about how Jeffrey Epstein “stole” Virginia Giuffre
  and other young female staffers, who he hired from the president’s Mar-a-Lago
  country club. Isn’t it lovely that the men who seem to consider themselves
  masters of the universe all seem to believe women are their personal property?
  Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved to the same prison as Elizabeth Holmes
  Perhaps the pair of them will collaborate on a new venture. MasterChef
  contestant edited out of series after asking for it not to be broadcast Sarah
  Shafi said she didn’t want the new series to be aired following allegations
  against the presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode. Instead the BBC edited
  her out of it. “I didn’t say edit me out,” Shafi said. “I said: ‘Axe the show
  … Prominent figures have been abusing their power. What message does that send
  out to women?” Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau were seen on a dinner date After
  telling us all she was going to put the “ass” in astronaut, Perry seems to be
  sharing the same orbit as the former Canadian prime minister. How did period
  drama get so raunchy? Hollie Richardson does a deep dive into the sudden
  explosion of steamy scenes in costume dramas. Nintendo of America once
  suggested giving Pikachu ‘huge breasts’ Pikachu is a cute little Pokémon
  species and, according to a newly surfaced interview, it almost got given
  feminine breasts for the American market in order to appeal to the sort of
  people who like to sexualize animated characters. How Israel caused a famine
  in Gaza A “worst-case scenario” human-made famine is now unfolding in Gaza –
  and the US continues to facilitate Israel’s genocide. Australian lawmaker says
  women like hairdressing and men like maths Liberal National party MP Terry
  Young has spoken out against a push for gender quotas by saying that men and
  women are drawn to different careers. Men like maths and physical exertion,
  according to Young, while women like styling hair and caring for others.
  “[I]t’s 2025,” the infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said in response.
  Your gender never means a job is off limits.” The week in pawtriarchy Let’s
  head to Florida now, where police recently arrested a Chuck E Cheese mascot
  for credit card fraud. “Chuck E, come with me,” an officer said as they led
  the large mouse away in handcuffs in front of horrified children. It’s not
  clear if a mugshot is available but one imagines police photographers asked
  the rodent to say “cheese”.
