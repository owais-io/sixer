  UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and
  agricultural products to the EU – costs that the government is promising to
  eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027. Government figures
  released on Tuesday showed it issued 328,727 such licences last year, at a
  cost of between £113 and £200 each. That would put the total cost to business
  at somewhere between £37m and £65m. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office
  minister in charge of European negotiations, will on Wednesday pledge to
  eliminate such costs as he promises a new agreement with the EU in the next 18
  months. In an event at the Spectator offices in London to be hosted by the
  leading Brexiter Michael Gove, Thomas-Symonds will make a vocally political
  argument for becoming closer to the EU. Ministers have decided in recent
  months their attempts to realign with Brussels enjoy more support than the
  approach of the Conservatives or Reform UK, which have promised to rip up
  Labour’s renegotiated deal. Thomas-Symonds will take specific aim at Farage,
  arguing: “Nigel Farage’s manifesto at the next election will say in writing he
  wants to take Britain backwards, cutting at least £9bn from the economy,
  bringing with it a risk to jobs and a risk of food prices going up.” A day
  after the Reform leader gave a speech warning that Britain was under threat
  from an “invasion” of asylum seekers, Thomas-Symonds will add: “Nigel Farage
  wants Britain to fail. His model of politics feeds on it, offering the easy
  answers, dividing communities and stoking anger.” Keir Starmer announced a new
  agreement with the EU in May, as part of which ministers agreed to pursue a
  series of specific deals, including one on food and agricultural products. The
  prime minister was attacked at the time by the Conservative leader, Kemi
  Badenoch, who argued that the UK was “being dragged back” into the EU, and
  Farage, the Reform leader, who called it a “Brexit betrayal”. Labour ministers
  have been keen to avoid any perception that they are reintroducing a customs
  union or free movement by the back door. But Thomas-Symonds’ speech on
  Wednesday indicates they are feeling more confident about making a pro-EU case
  for removing trade barriers. He will say the government is “putting in the
  hard yards, not resting on empty slogans” and that its policy is based on
  “sovereignty, in the national interest”. Labour says its new agricultural deal
  will mean fewer checks on meat, fish, fruit and vegetables imported from the
  EU, and an end to the current export-licensing scheme. A report on Tuesday
  from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said these costs
  had been particularly burdensome for smaller business, warning: “These firms
  often lack the capacity and economies of scale to manage the administrative
  and compliance demands associated with NTMs (non-tariff measures). “This has
  created a competitive disadvantage between smaller firms and larger operators
  with in-house capability – although all stakeholders report increased costs.”
  In April, British supermarkets and food producers, including Marks &amp;
  Spencer and Sainsbury’s, urged the EU to complete the proposed goods and
  agricultural deal, saying the existing arrangement had led to “unnecessary red
  tape”. A Labour spokesperson said: “The Tory Brexit deal was a complete
  failure, saddling businesses with costs they shouldn’t have had to face and
  harming our economy in the process. “But Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch have
  both committed to ripping up Labour’s agreement and keeping this damaging red
  tape in place.”
