  “Marc and me, we have the same fate,” Oliver Glasner said with a smile. It was
  the eve of Crystal Palace’s meeting with Liverpool in the Community Shield and
  – not for the last time over the next few weeks – the unavoidable question of
  his captain’s future had just been broached. Marc Guéhi had entered the final
  year of his contract at Palace and everyone knew a swift resolution was
  needed. “Of course, everybody wants Marc to sign a new contract,” said
  Glasner, who had broken off negotiations about extending his own deal after
  leading Palace to their first major trophy by winning the FA Cup a few weeks
  earlier. “It will be his decision. We never know what will happen in this
  sometimes crazy transfer market.” Yet no one could have imagined quite how
  dramatically things would turn out. Having said after Palace defeated Arne
  Slot’s side on penalties at Wembley that “for players of that calibre to leave
  on a free, it’s a problem for us unfortunately”, a late U-turn on Guéhi’s
  future by the club’s chairman, Steve Parish, even managed to take the
  spotlight away from the conclusion to Alexander Isak’s drawn-out move to
  Anfield for a British record fee on deadline day. It was a stunning victory
  for Glasner, who consistently made no secret of his opposition to Guéhi being
  sold so late in the window without an adequate replacement being secured.
  After beating Aston Villa 3-0 on Sunday evening in another impressive
  performance that established a club record of 14 matches unbeaten in all
  competitions as a top-flight club, the Austrian doubled down on his stance
  that Palace had not fulfilled a promise they made to him in March during a
  meeting about recruitment plans this summer. But the surprise departure of the
  sporting director Dougie Freedman to Saudi Arabia a few days after that
  meeting – coupled with the uncertainty over which European competition Palace
  would be in after defeating Manchester City in the FA Cup final – threw the
  club’s transfer plans into turmoil. Liverpool had indicated all summer that
  they were willing to pay no more than £35m for Guéhi despite Palace turning
  down a £70m offer from Tottenham for the England international in January,
  with the 25-year-old having made it clear he wanted to join the Premier League
  champions and would not sign a new contract. Given that Chelsea were due a 20%
  sell-on clause after selling him in 2021 for around £18m, Parish wanted at
  least £40m and had lined up Sporting’s Ousmane Diomande as Guéhi’s
  replacement. An injury to the Ivory Coast defender led to a frantic search for
  other options that is understood to have ended in failure minutes before the
  deadline. Manchester City’s Manuel Akanji, Lloyd Kelly of Juventus, Milan’s
  Strahinja Pavlovic and Mohammed Salisu of Monaco were just a few of the
  defenders targeted, although Palace were able to bring in the promising
  teenager Jaydee Canvot from Toulouse for £21m. Glasner is said to rate the
  France Under‑20 international as a huge prospect for the future but,
  understandably given that he has played only 14 Ligue 1 games, he did not see
  him as a player who could step into Guéhi’s boots immediately. Parish is
  believed to have been undecided as late as 2pm on deadline day whether to
  accept Liverpool’s offer before eventually relenting. Glasner was informed of
  the news and once again made it clear that he was extremely unhappy, with the
  51-year-old, who was never afraid to speak out about squad investment during
  spells in charge of Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt, even threatening to
  quit before Parish changed his mind. Meanwhile, Guéhi had already completed
  the first part of his medical in London and was shocked to be told that Palace
  had pulled the plug on his move. Unlike Isak, he has continued to play
  throughout all the speculation and is understood to have been left hugely
  disappointed. There is no question that he remains committed to Palace,
  however, even if Liverpool are likely to return in January when he will also
  be able to sign a pre-contract agreement for an overseas club. Barcelona,
  Bayern Munich and Juventus are believed to have expressed an interest. For
  Parish, who has been heavily criticised by some Palace fans for what Glasner
  called a “passive” approach in the transfer window, Guéhi remaining in situ
  has resolved one headache but created several others. Work was meant to begin
  this summer on building a new main stand at Selhurst Park that some sources
  now expect will cost £250m. But with the focus having been elsewhere –
  European battles and transfer sagas – there is a risk of further delays on
  that project, despite planning permission having been granted in 2018. The
  club-record sale of Eberechi Eze to Arsenal for a fee that could be worth up
  to £67.5m meant Palace made a profit of £16m in this window having brought in
  five new players, albeit with £17m due to Getafe as part of the deal to make
  Christantus Uche’s move permanent next year. Given that, losing out on £35m
  for Guéhi may not be such a financial disaster, especially if the club can
  recoup some money by selling him to Liverpool in January having had more time
  to find a suitable replacement. But it is the future of Glasner that will be
  of most concern to Palace’s board. There was no sign of any extra investment
  from the new biggest shareholder, Woody Johnson, the American billionaire who
  owns the New York Jets, in the transfer window as they failed to persuade Club
  Brugge to part with Glasner’s top attacking target, Christos Tzolis. Unless
  that changes in January, keeping their hugely ambitious manager beyond this
  season will be perhaps the biggest challenge Parish has faced since rescuing
  the club from administration in 2010.
