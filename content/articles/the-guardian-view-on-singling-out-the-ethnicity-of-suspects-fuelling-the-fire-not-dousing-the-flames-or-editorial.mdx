  The Guardian view on singling out the ethnicity of suspects: fuelling the
  fire, not dousing the flames | Editorial

  The speed and scale at which disinformation spreads is one of the central
  challenges of our age. But if facts alone were sufficient to dispel rumours,
  conspiracy theories and lies then the far right in Britain would be out of
  business. Instead, it is flourishing, and moving into the political
  mainstream. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has welcomed new police
  guidelines encouraging forces to release the ethnicity and migration status of
  those charged in high-profile cases. She had already indicated that she
  believed the guidance needed to change and urged the Law Commission to
  accelerate its review around what information can be released ahead of trials.
  The idea is that the shift will help to prevent a repeat of the riots that
  swept parts of England a year ago after lies spread that the murderer of three
  schoolgirls in Southport was a Muslim asylum seeker. Police rebutted the
  claims relatively quickly, albeit not as fast as some hoped. The truth did not
  stop the unrest. No one doubts that there is a problem; the question is
  whether this is the right solution. As Southport and other cases show, the
  police already had the power to release information to dispel lies. Police
  will increasingly be badgered for the information if they do not share it, and
  Diana Johnson, the policing minister, has said that the government will want
  the details released in “most cases”: the hope is that the guidance turns an
  exceptional decision into a routine one. The need for transparency, especially
  important in an era when faith in authority is battered for reasons good and
  bad, must be weighed against investigative needs and the demands of a fair
  trial. The bare-bones information initially revealed of a suspect’s identity
  is supplemented over the criminal process. The police, never the most
  transparent institution, have often tilted too far towards caution on sharing
  information after the Leveson inquiry into the press. But – even putting aside
  the question of whether the police are ideally placed to handle sensitive
  matters of ethnicity given their own record – one would have to be remarkably
  naive to see those now demanding more information on the origins of suspects
  as champions of the truth. They are not seeking enlightenment: they want
  confirmation of their prejudices and assistance in spreading them. Singling
  out one particular aspect of a suspect’s identity does not merely give
  credence to but cements the belief that race or migration status are central
  to criminality – when, as the grandfather of one Southport victim, Bebe King,
  observed: “Mental health issues, and the propensity to commit crime, happens
  in any ethnicity, nationality or race.” Poor educational attainment is
  correlated with criminal convictions. But no one is demanding the release of
  suspects’ school records. The Leveson report also pointed to the evidence of
  “discriminatory, sensational or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic
  minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers”. Rightwing media, and far-right
  agitators, will emblazon offences ascribed to asylum seekers or members of the
  South Asian diaspora across websites and social media platforms, while
  ignoring the ethnicity of the perpetrator when white Britons are responsible.
  The government either wants to close down a line of political attack, or more
  generously, douse the fires set by those promoting division and hatred. But
  disclosing ethnicity is more likely to fuel them by legitimising and further
  embedding the far right’s poisonous worldview.
