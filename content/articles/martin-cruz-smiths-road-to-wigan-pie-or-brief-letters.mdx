  Martin Cruz Smith (Obituary, 31 July) was clearly a novelist who did his
  research, sometimes to disconcerting effect. While an American chiefly known
  for a Russia-set series, his standalone novel Rose not only dispatched its
  protagonist to Wigan, but showed sufficient grasp of local custom to have him
  ask whether his expenses would be paid in pies. Huw Richards London • Why is
  the Church of England apparently unable to agree on a replacement for Justin
  Welby (Letters, 7 August)? The answer is all too obvious. There are several
  outstanding candidates, but they all have – in the view of all too many
  members of the ruling body of the church – one drawback that rules them out of
  the running. I believe we all know what this is. Linda Evans Hinton
  Charterhouse, Somerset • In the photo in your print edition, Kemi Badenoch
  appears to be flying the union flag upside down in her ice cream stand
  (Conservatives not close to recognising how badly they are positioned for next
  election, says Gauke, 13 August). This is generally understood to be a
  distress signal. Is she asking for help? Dr Jenny Bywaters Sheffield • Thanks
  for offering “champagne” in the Word Wheel on the day that our son turned 50
  and our granddaughter achieved three A-stars in her A-levels (14 August). Ian
  and Jane Waller St Albans • My thought for the day is: “What is the best way
  to annoy Robert Jenrick?” (BBC apologises over Thought for the Day
  ‘xenophobia’ claim against Jenrick, 13 August). Ian Grieve Gordon Bennett,
  Llangollen canal • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian
  today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication
