  In just seven extraordinary months, Donald Trump’s administration has left an
  unprecedented mark on the United States. From rewriting the rules of free
  trade to upending the norms of due process and challenging scientific
  orthodoxy, no corner of the country has remained untouched, including the
  president’s own centre of power: the Oval Office. Leaning into his former
  career as a real estate developer and hotelier, the president has, in his own
  words, applied some “Trump touches” to the room’s decor. The results have
  split opinions, with some calling the revamped office a symbol of America’s
  new golden age, while others have compared it to a professional wrestler’s
  dressing room. On a tour of the Oval Office in March, Trump was asked about
  some of the new gold details by a Fox News host. Describing the room as
  needing “a little life”, he went on to explain how difficult it is to get gold
  paint to look like gold. That apparent impediment did not hold the president
  back from continuing his refurbishments. Over the following months, the
  “goldening” ratcheted up, with gold trimming across the ceiling, door frames
  and fireplace. Even the sculpted cherubim inside door frames were painted
  gold. Over the months of his administration, the number of of gold trophies
  and vases littered across the mantlepiece have multiplied and there are now
  even gold coasters with Trump’s name on them. A White House spokesperson told
  Fox News that the gold – “of the highest quality” – was all paid for by Trump
  personally. The president has also multiplied the number of paintings on
  display, with almost 20 images of presidential predecessors adorning the
  walls. His predecessor, Joe Biden, had just six paintings on the walls. Barack
  Obama had pictures of just two former presidents. The office is rounded out
  with pictures of the Trump family, a copy of the declaration of independence
  and gifts from visitors and well-wishers – including the Fifa Club World Cup
  trophy, which was given to Trump by the organisation’s president. The White
  House was approached for comment, but aides have previously told US media that
  every addition has come at the president’s direction. To help in this venture,
  Trump has reportedly called in the help of his personal “gold guy”. John
  Icart, a 70-year-old cabinet maker from Florida, was reportedly flown to
  Washington on Air Force One to provide the White House with the flourishes he
  brought to Trump’s Palm Beach mansion, Mar-a-Lago. The gilded carvings Icart
  added to the room prompted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to
  describe it as a “golden office for the golden age”. Others have been more
  critical. It was musician Jack White who compared the room to a wrestler’s
  dressing room, calling it “vulgar” and “gaudy”. Reporter Jon Keegan pointed
  out that decorative medallions that festoon the walls of the room also bore
  more than a passing resemblance to “Foam Veneer Accessories” available from
  Chinese e-commerce site Ali Baba for just $1 a piece. The gold artefacts that
  have multiplied across the mantle piece are known to have a more auspicious
  pedigree. Coming from the White House’s own collection, they include a
  19th-century French compotier, gilded urns given to president James Monroe and
  silver dating to the Eisenhower administration. Trump’s style is said to have
  been inspired by the Versailles hall of mirrors, and he has in the past
  bragged that the ballroom of his Florida home was itself modelled on the
  French palace. But in making these changes to the Oval Office, Trump has
  placed himself in a long tradition that sees every resident of the White House
  adjust the decor to their liking, including new furniture, wallpaper and rugs.
  But perhaps no president has gone further to transport the aesthetics of their
  pre-presidential home to Washington. In the final year of his presidency,
  Obama was asked what art or object in the Oval Office was most significant to
  him. He pointed to the carpet beneath his feet. Handmade for him in a Michigan
  studio, the almost 10-metre-wide rug featured quotes around the perimeter from
  US leaders including Abraham Lincoln, John F Kennedy and Theodore Roosevelt.
  It was a line from Martin Luther King that Obama was said to be most fond of:
  “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” A few
  months later, as Trump began moving into the White House and America’s winding
  story took another unexpected turn, Obama’s prized carpet was jettisoned,
  replaced by a floor covering with a golden tinge.
