  It has been a summer of heatwaves in western Europe, with record highs of 46C
  (115F) in Spain and Portugal. An estimated 2,300 people died of heat-related
  causes across 12 European cities in June, according to a rapid scientific
  analysis, with two-thirds of those deaths linked to climate breakdown, which
  has made heatwaves more severe. While green spaces can help mitigate extreme
  heat, a recent study shows that urban green spaces are not distributed
  equitably. Nearly 80% of the population of western Europe live in urban areas,
  and the urban heat island effect turns those cities into pressure cookers
  during a heatwave. Street trees, parks and green roofs can significantly lower
  temperatures, and many cities are planting more trees and creating green
  spaces. Weiqi Zhou, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and
  colleagues mapped green space creation and compared this with levels of social
  deprivation in two megacities: Beijing and New York City. Their results,
  published in Earth’s Future, show green space is more likely to be added in
  high-income areas, exacerbating social vulnerability. They conclude that
  cities should prioritise the most vulnerable neighbourhoods for urban greening
  and not just plant trees where it is easy to do so.
