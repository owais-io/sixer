  Andrew Bailey is right to distance the British financial system from
  cryptocurrency, but he is being too polite about it (Editorial, 29 July).
  Cryptocurrency is evil. Being speculative in nature, it serves no purpose as a
  useful currency, and being secretive, it facilitates international drug
  dealing, people trafficking and terrorism. In addition to helping destabilise
  our precarious world, it has a huge, unnecessary carbon footprint. It’s time
  for our financial authorities to speak truth to money. Nick Makepeace
  Narberth, Pembrokeshire • At my primary school in 1948 I was sent almost daily
  to the headmaster, who would give me two painful whacks on each of my hands –
  all for talking in class. I now appreciate that I simply suffered, well before
  my time, from an excess of “oracy” (Letters, 1 August). Alan Woolley
  Weybridge, Surrey • With reference to the letter from Mike Lowcock about
  Prince Charles (31 July), the wearing of a sgian-dubh (“dagger” as you so
  tweely translated for your English readers) is legal when worn as part of the
  national dress of Scotland. Mark Westwood Edinburgh • Are any of the 472 white
  storks seen over London from 2016 to 2023 (Report, 4 August) evidence of
  assistance to the beleaguered NHS maternity services? David Fellows
  Storrington, West Sussex • Our local tip here in Grantham (Letters, 30 July)
  has a picture of Margaret Thatcher hanging in its canteen. It’s used as a
  dartboard. Lyn Hogan Grantham, Lincolnshire • Have an opinion on anything
  you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be
  considered for publication in our letters section.
