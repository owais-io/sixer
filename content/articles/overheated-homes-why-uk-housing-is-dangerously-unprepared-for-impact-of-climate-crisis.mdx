  Overheated homes: why UK housing is dangerously unprepared for impact of
  climate crisis

  Wondering what future British summers will be like, as the climate crisis
  unfolds? Clue: put away visions of sipping Yorkshire champagne on a
  Barcelona-style balcony. Think instead of stuffy, overheated homes making
  sleep impossible, droughts and floods that play havoc with infrastructure, and
  urgent health warnings for the old and very young. “What we are facing is
  climate brutality. That is the reality of the hotter weather coming down the
  track,” says Simon McWhirter, the chief executive of the UK Green Building
  Council (UKGBC). Temperatures have already topped 40C during one summer, in
  2022, and that record-breaking heat is likely to be repeated in the next 12
  years, according to the Met Office, as global heating drives more weather
  extremes. A temperature of 28C inside the home is likely to become the norm in
  London and the south-east in the decades to come, according to McWhirter.
  Sweltering summers are more likely even when the sun isn’t shining – muggy
  weather such as that of last month in many parts of the UK will be more
  common. Despite years of warnings, however, the UK is poorly prepared. The
  Climate Change Committee, the government’s statutory adviser, has repeatedly
  highlighted a lack of urgent effort to adapt critical infrastructure, from
  water, transport and communication networks, to the fabric of our buildings.
  “The way we are building new housing is not adequate to the climate change we
  are already seeing, never mind the even hotter weather that’s coming,” says
  McWhirter. Part of this is owing to the construction of the homes themselves,
  which need good ventilation to create through airflow that cools rooms, with
  well-designed windows and external shutters, and reflective paint on roofs or
  outside surfaces. Homes should also be highly water-efficient, for instance
  being able to recycle bathwater to flush toilets or water gardens, to cope
  with the impacts of drought. Keeping cool also depends on the locality around
  a building, especially the shade and cooling impact of street trees. The UKGBC
  advocates a 3:30:300 approach: you should be able to see three trees from your
  dwelling; you should have 30% tree canopy cover in your neighbourhood; and you
  should be no more than 300 metres from a biodiverse green space or park. New
  rules aimed at overhauling how new homes are built have been promised for two
  decades. The first attempt was set out by Labour in 2008, only to be scrapped
  by the Conservatives in 2015, and years later a fresh attempt was mauled and
  delayed. This autumn, the “future homes standard” (FHS) should finally be
  published, to come into force from 2027. But throughout this needlessly
  tortuous and expensive process, the focus has been mainly on how to keep
  draughty homes warm in winter, to stop them leaking heat – and money, and
  carbon dioxide alongside. The challenge of cooling overheated homes is new –
  and the current draft of the FHS fails to meet it, McWhirter says. “The FHS
  does not address this threat properly,” he says. “The focus has been on energy
  conservation and reducing bills. Absent has been the other side of the coin,
  which is climate impacts.” Fortunately, according to Steve Turner, the
  executive director of the Home Builders Federation, insulating homes to retain
  heat in winter also helps to keep heat out in summer. “New-build homes are
  required to be exceptionally well insulated, which helps keep them stay both
  warmer in winter and cooler in summer,” he says. “This makes living in a
  new-build more comfortable and significantly cheaper to run than older, less
  well insulated homes.” One obvious answer to overheating may seem to be air
  conditioning – it’s common in hot countries, so why not here? Ministers are
  now considering subsidising the installation of air conditioning in the UK for
  the first time, a position the UKGBC supports. But that would be a
  controversial departure from climate policy. The boiler upgrade scheme offers
  households a substantial discount on the installation of air-source heat
  pumps, efficient electrical alternatives to gas boilers, in order to cut
  fossil fuel use and meet net zero targets. Up to now, only standard heat pumps
  have been eligible for the grants. Yet a form of technology exists that can
  heat and cool buildings: “air to air” heat pumps, which rely on taking in air
  from outside and passing it through a heat exchanger to create hotter or
  cooler air that is pumped into the home. The problem is that air conditioning
  is extremely energy-intensive. The “air to air” heating and cooling involved
  is much less efficient than “wet” heating systems that heat water for
  radiators, so machines that can do both are a poor substitute for the
  efficient heat pumps needed for net zero, according to the HBF. Around the
  world, air conditioning requires such vast quantities of energy that the UN
  warned in July that the beneficial impacts of a massive surge in renewable
  power generation were being swamped by the vastly increasing demands of AI,
  datacentres and air con. The government intends that if air-to-air heat pumps
  are allowed, they should mostly be replacing current electric heating systems
  in small homes, particularly flats, where conventional heat pumps can be
  harder to install. This, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero
  argues, could overall cut bills and energy consumption, as the increase in
  summer demand could be offset by winter savings. The government has
  commissioned further research and modelling on the issue. Even if the
  government’s target of 1.5m new homes this parliament is achieved, newly built
  homes will still make up only a small fraction of the UK’s housing stock.
  Changing existing homes will be far harder. Ensuring homes do not overheat is
  governed by Part O of the UK’s building regulations, which came into force
  only in June 2022 – explaining why so many homes built even in the past few
  years are overheating. Part O applies only to new homes, though the government
  is considering whether it should be expanded to cover a change of use, such as
  offices converted to flats. At the moment, there are no substantial plans to
  retrofit the bulk of the UK’s existing homes to stop overheating. A government
  spokesperson said: “We know the importance of keeping homes cool in hot
  weather. That’s why building regulations require new homes to be built to
  reduce the risk of overheating and through the future homes standard
  consultation we are exploring how to further improve protections. This is
  alongside considering the use of air-air heat pumps to keep existing homes
  cool under the boiler upgrade scheme.” If ministers wanted, they could also
  ensure that rented accommodation was brought up to decent standards on
  overheating. Without such enforcement, it will be up to individual
  householders – in which case, shutters and blinds should be top of the list,
  way ahead of any type of air con system.
