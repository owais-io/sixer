  Aviva’s chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has reiterated the insurer’s commitment
  to climate goals in the face of growing pushback against net zero ambitions in
  the US and UK. On Thursday Aviva’s shares hit their highest level since the
  2008 financial crisis, with investors cheering a rise in profits, and fresh
  payouts for investors worth 13.1p a share. Blanc told journalists that the
  insurer was not wavering on climate transition plans, which she said were an
  important step in responding to a further rise in extreme weather events
  affecting its insurance business. “We remain committed to our ambition,” she
  said on Thursday. “It’s also an important priority for many of our clients,
  but I would always put this into the context of extreme weather conditions,
  climate change and the impact that that has on our insurance business that
  actually insures properties.” Blanc, who became a dame commander in the
  honours list in December 2023 in part for her services to net zero, said: “If
  you think about the last number of years: the wildfires we saw in Canada last
  year, the floods in the UK, the frequency of these weather events, then we do
  think that that is something that we have to think very carefully about – the
  insurability of these properties as climate changes.” Finance companies are
  facing pressure over their green commitments after Donald Trump’s return to
  the White House, which has sparked a fresh climate backlash and a renewed push
  for higher production of oil and gas. A wave of US banks have since dropped
  membership of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, throwing the future of the
  UN-backed climate collective into doubt. Banks that have left include JP
  Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The UK
  lenders HSBC and Barclays followed suit. Those departures have led to a schism
  in the financial world. Standard Chartered’s chief executive, Bill Winters,
  condemned rivals for having jumped on the climate bandwagon when it was
  “fashionable” but having since rolled back on their green ambitions or gone
  quiet on the subject. “Shame on them”, he said last month. Blanc noted that
  Aviva had this year published a fresh net zero transition plan, seeking to cut
  emissions from its immediate operations by 90% by 2030, compared with 2019,
  and buy all its electricity from renewable sources. She said emissions linked
  to clients was a “more complex” issue to tackle but “something we will keep a
  close eye on”. She said: “The important thing for us is to offer optionality
  for either investors, customers, or people at the funds that they want to
  invest in, but also thinking about the practical side of that for our
  insurance business itself.” Aviva reported a 22% jump in operating profit to
  £1bn for the six months to June, up from £875m a year earlier, helped by
  strong growth in general insurance premiums in the UK and Ireland and a
  greater number of assets flowing into its wealth business. Its shares jumped
  as much as 4.7% to about £6.90, before closing up nearly 2.6% at £6.75. The
  shares of the rival insurer Admiral rose by almost 6% after it reported a 67%
  increase in half-year profits to £516m, as competitive pricing helped to boost
  the performance of its UK car insurance division.
