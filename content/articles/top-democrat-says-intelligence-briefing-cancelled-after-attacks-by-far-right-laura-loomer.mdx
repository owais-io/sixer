  Senator Mark Warner said on Wednesday that a meeting he had scheduled at the
  headquarters of a US intelligence agency was cancelled following online
  attacks by the far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer.
  Warner, the Democratic vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, was
  set to visit the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in Virginia in what
  he described part of his “responsibility to provide oversight and support to
  our intelligence community”. The administration rescinded the invitation after
  Loomer initiated a “campaign of baseless attacks” against him and the agency’s
  director, Trey Whitworth, he said. “I can’t overstate how unprecedented and
  dangerous this is,” Warner said in a fundraising email. “This administration
  is taking its marching orders from Laura Loomer – a wackjob with a long
  history of outlandish fringe views, including 9/11 denialism, anti-Muslim
  harassment campaigns, and associations with white supremacists.” Loomer posted
  on social media in recent days complaining that the director of an
  intelligence agency was hosting a “rabid ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRAT SENATOR”. She
  celebrated the cancellation, calling Warner a threat to national security and
  arguing he should be removed from the Senate committee. “He weaponized our
  intelligence agencies to push the debunked Russia Collusion Hoax,” she wrote.
  She told the New York Times Warner should “be removed from office and tried
  for treason”. Warner told reporters that the decision to cancel the previously
  unpublicized meeting was made by the office of the defense secretary. The
  incident illustrates Loomer’s enduring influence within Donald Trump’s
  administration. The 32-year-old, who has previously described herself as “a
  proud Islamophobe”, has acted as a national security and foreign policy
  adviser to the president. In April, Trump fired six staffers after Loomer gave
  him a list of people she believed were not sufficiently loyal to the
  president. Last month, the administration announced it was planning to stop
  issuing visas to children from Gaza seeking medical care after complaints from
  Loomer. Warner argued that Loomer is “basically a cabinet member at this
  point” and that Trump and his administration were “caving to whatever she
  wants”. “This nakedly political decision undermines the dedicated, nonpartisan
  staff at [the] NGA and threatens the principle of civilian oversight that
  protects our national security,” Warner said in a statement. “Members of
  Congress routinely conduct meetings and on-site engagements with federal
  employees in their states and districts; blocking and setting arbitrary
  conditions on these sessions sets a dangerous precedent, calling into question
  whether oversight is now allowed only when it pleases the far-right fringe.”
