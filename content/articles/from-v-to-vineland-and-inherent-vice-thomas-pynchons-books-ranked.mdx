  9 Slow Learner (1984) A collection of early short stories that is chiefly of
  interest for the introduction, in which the author spells out why he thinks
  they fail. Pynchon does not spare himself but, unfortunately, he is right. For
  aficionados only. Typical line “Downstairs, Meatball Mulligan’s lease-breaking
  party was moving into its 40th hour.” Pynchon tropes Wacky names, pastiche
  songs 8 Against the Day (2006) Practically plotless, prolix and gargantuan,
  this novel landed with a thump following a nine-year gap. Characters fragment
  and double in a bewildering array, the style pastiches pulp novels, adventure
  stories and science fiction. It does not add up to more than the sum of its
  admittedly ingenious parts. Typical line “Taking quick looks behind him on the
  trail, Lew Basnight was apt to see things that weren’t necessarily there.”
  Pynchon tropes Real-life events, pastiche songs 7 Bleeding Edge (2013)
  Pynchon’s most recent novel is a lightweight. The protagonist, Maxine Tarnow,
  mother of two, longsuffering partner to a feckless financier, finds herself
  chasing shadows around Manhattan’s Silicon Alley. Maxine’s skills as a fraud
  investigator are put to the test unravelling the machinations of the nasty
  controller of a computer security firm who will do anything to get his hands
  on a virtual reality simulator called DeepArcher (geddit?). There are
  plentiful puns, red herrings and surnames that serve as possibly unhelpful
  acronyms – the usual Pynchon ingredients, in other words. Here they fail to
  cohere into an entirely satisfying whole. Typical line “Paranoia’s the garlic
  in life’s kitchen … you can never have too much.” Pynchon tropes Pastiche
  songs, sex, historical events 6 Vineland (1990) It is 1984, the year of
  Reagan’s re-election but for Zoyd Wheeler, Los Angeles-based veteran of the
  radical left, time has stopped. His wife, Frenesi, has left him to raise their
  daughter, Prairie, alone and he resorts to dismal acts of self-sabotage in
  order to qualify for government benefits. Prairie, in turn, flees the family
  coop to track down her mother, a subversive turned informant in league with
  federal baddy Brock Vond. Pynchon’s themes are prescient – surveillance, media
  saturation, generational miscommunication – but his aim is off. Typical line
  “If patterns of ones and zeros were ‘like’ patterns of human lives and deaths,
  if everything about an individual could be represented in a computer record by
  a long string of ones and zeros, then what kind of creature would be
  represented by a long string of lives and deaths.” Pynchon tropes Sex, drugs,
  anagrams 5 V. (1963) Sincerity is not a quality readily associated with
  Pynchon, but his debut novel displays an affection for his characters that
  would later take second place to irony. The story bounces between Benny
  Profane, unemployed sailor, and Herbert Stencil, obsessive seeker of the
  elusive V. The language shows its age in places, but the plight of people
  determined to keep themselves in the dark is as relevant as ever. Typical line
  “Perhaps history this century … is rippled with gathers in its fabric such
  that if we are situated, as Stencil seemed to be, at the bottom of a fold,
  it’s impossible to determine warp, woof or pattern anywhere else.” Pynchon
  tropes Pastiche songs, sex, real-life events 4 The Crying of Lot 49 (1966) The
  author regretted publishing this novel but he was being unduly harsh on
  himself. Short, funny and shot through with allusions you can choose to follow
  or ignore, the story of Oedipa Maas’s search for the meaning behind the
  supposed rivalry of postal companies is the literary equivalent of
  non-Euclidean geometry. Typical line “Oedipa wondered whether, at the end of
  this (if it were supposed to end), she too might not be left with only
  compiled memories of clues, announcements, intimations, but never the central
  truth itself.” Pynchon tropes Sex, pastiche songs 3 Inherent Vice (2009)
  Wilfully weird, often sordid and occasionally borderline unintelligible,
  Pynchon’s seventh novel was adapted for the big screen by Paul Thomas Anderson
  in 2014. The adaptation was nominated for an Oscar, making Pynchon as
  mainstream as he’s ever likely to get. Larry “Doc” Sportello is a private
  investigator with a broken heart and a huge appetite for marijuana. His
  ex-girlfriend reappears out of nowhere, implores Doc to find her married
  lover, then promptly vanishes again. At the heart of the murky tale lurks the
  sinister presence of the Golden Fang, a vessel that means, as Doc surmises, “a
  lot of things to a lot of people” – all of them unsavoury. Typical line
  “‘What,’ Doc wondered aloud, ‘the fuck is going on here?’” Pynchon tropes
  Drugs, sex, rock’n’roll 2 Gravity’s Rainbow (1973) This kaleidoscopic tour de
  force cemented Pynchon’s reputation as a writer of baffling, farcical and
  profound genius. A chief delight is his brilliant ear for dialogue which is
  given full rein in this twisted tale of allied intelligence officers, Nazis,
  scientists and seers united by a MacGuffin in the shape of a mysterious
  rocket. The action arcs from London under bombardment to a postwar zone of
  surrender. What is striking is how the themes explored here – forever wars,
  technological domination, uncontrollable cartels – have become staples of
  internet discourse. Typical line “A screaming comes across the sky. It has
  happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now.” Pynchon tropes
  Sex, pastiche songs, real-life events 1 Mason &amp; Dixon (1997) Pynchon gives
  the 18th-century novel a postmodern twist to explore the relationship between
  Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, British surveyors tasked with ending a
  boundary dispute between the colonies of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
  The Mason-Dixon line would later mark the division between free and slave
  states in the US. The author layers fact over anachronistic fiction,
  scientific inquiry over conspiratorial rumour, and tragedy over knockabout
  farce, in a virtuoso display of storytelling. There are walk-on parts for
  Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. A further conceit
  lies in the narration of events by the Reverend Wicks Cherrycoke, many years
  after they supposedly took place. It is a ripping yarn spun for the
  incredulous enjoyment of both the cleric’s family and the grateful reader.
  Typical line “For if each Star is little more a mathmatikal Point, located
  upon the Hemisphere of Heaven by Right Ascension and Declination, then all the
  Stars, taken together, tho’ innumerable, must like any other set of points, in
  turn represent some single gigantick Equation, to the mind of God as
  straightforward as, say, the Equation of a Sphere, – to us unreadable,
  incalculable.” Pynchon tropes Pastiche songs, historical events • To explore
