  He has long been considered one of the leading heart-throbs of the silver
  screen, but for his latest role in Olivier Assayas’s political drama The
  Wizard of the Kremlin, Jude Law steps into the shoes of a far more forbidding
  figure: Vladimir Putin. Law has said he was unfazed by the prospect of playing
  Vladimir Putin and that he did not – he hoped “not naively” – fear any
  repercussions. Speaking at a press conference before the film’s premiere at
  the Venice film festival on Sunday, the Bafta-winning actor said: “I felt
  confident, in the hands of Olivier [the director] and the script, that this
  story was going to be told intelligently and with nuance and consideration.
  “We weren’t looking for controversy for controversy’s sake. It’s a character
  within a much broader story. We weren’t trying to define anything about
  anyone.” The film is an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli’s bestselling book of
  the same name and revolves around Vadim Baranov, a scheming Russian spin
  doctor (played by Paul Dano) who smooths Putin’s ascent to power in the 1990s.
  The character was inspired by a real-life fixer, Vladislav Surkov, who was key
  in shaping Russian political strategy. Dano, when asked if he found any
  positives in his character, said: “I don’t think you have to look for a
  positive, but I do think you have to be willing to discover the point of view
  of the character. If you were to just label a character like Baranov as bad,
  it would be a massive oversimplification, which does more harm than good.” Law
  said one of the challenges he faced was portraying an opaque figure whose
  tightly controlled public image revealed little of the man behind it. “The
  tricky side to me was that the public face we see gives very, very little
  away. There has been a term for him and that is ‘the man without a face’.
  There’s a mask. Understandably, Olivier would want me to portray this or that
  in a scene with a certain emotion, and I felt the conflict of trying to show
  very little.” The film marks an English-language debut for Assayas, best known
  for Clouds of Sils Maria and Personal Shopper. It co-stars Alicia Vikander,
  Tom Sturridge and Jeffrey Wright. The timing of its release, three years into
  Russia’s war in Ukraine, has stoked questions about the state of contemporary
  geopolitics. Assayas, when asked whether Russia ruled the world today, said:
  “The answer is no, but I understand the question. The film is very much about
  how modern politics, 21st-century politics, was invented, and part of that
  evil raised from the rise to power of Vladimir Putin in Russia.” The
  70-year-old said politics had “changed in a major way, especially for people
  from my generation”. “What’s going on right now is not only terrifying, but
  it’s even more terrifying by the fact that we haven’t really found the
  answer,” he said. Wright said the film made him think about America’s place in
  history and the dangers of contemporary authoritarianism. “There’s a specific
  Russian history, and here’s a specific American history that is in contrast to
  that,” he said. “We have had impulses toward fascism, impulses toward
  autocracy and all manner of sins. But what we also have had, from the very
  beginning, even within the timeframe of the original sins of America, even
  within that grotesqueness, we had an idea that we could be better, this idea
  that we could aspire towards some type of utopian perfectibility. If that is
  lost, as it is now, then we become the thing we see in this film,” he said.
  Elsewhere on Sunday, the American film-maker Jim Jarmusch added his voice to
  the backlash against Mubi after the distributor took on an investor with close
  ties to the Israeli military. Mubi co-produced Jarmusch’s Father Mother Sister
  Brother, which premiered on the Lido on Sunday and stars Cate Blanchett, Adam
  Driver, Charlotte Rampling, Indya Moore and others. Jarmusch said Mubi “were
  fantastic to work with on the film” but that he was “disappointed and
  disconcerted by this relationship [with Israel]”. He said that as an
  independent film-maker he had taken money from various sources to fund his
  films. “I consider all corporate money is dirty money,” he said. “If you start
  analysing each of these film companies and their financing structures, you’re
  going to find a lot of nasty dirt. We could avoid it and not make films at
  all. But films are how I carry what I like to say. Yes, I’m concerned. But one
  thing I don’t like is putting the onus of the explanation on us the artists.”
  Moore also spoke at length on the topic. “Since the genocide of Palestinians
  began, there has been an incredible amount of creative and resource warfare
  behind the scenes,” she said. “People are trying to find out how to work in a
  capacity that’s ethical and not enabling. “I think the kinds of due diligence
  that people are trying to do is a developing process … we’re all trying to
  navigate this.” Mubi’s chief executive, Efe Cakarel, addressed the criticism
  in an open letter earlier this month in which he said accusations that it was
  complicit in events in Gaza were “fundamentally at odds with the values we
  hold as individuals and as a company”.
