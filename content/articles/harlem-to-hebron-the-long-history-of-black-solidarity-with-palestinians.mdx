  “Our freedom will be incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinian
  people.” When Nelson Mandela spoke those words in 1997, it resonated deeply
  across much of the Black diaspora, which has long felt a strong kinship with
  the struggles of the Palestinian people. In this week’s Long Wave, as yet more
  journalists are killed in Gaza, and some western countries make belated moves
  to recognise a Palestinian state, I examine the history of that Black
  solidarity, and how it has endured. Before that, some housekeeping: we’d love
  to know what you think of The Long Wave – what you’re enjoying, what you’re
  not and how we can improve. So if you can spare a few minutes, please fill out
  this short survey. A shared history of oppression A Palestinian state was
  first declared by Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation
  Organisation, in 1988. Of the 84 countries that immediately recognised the new
  state, half were African or Caribbean countries. But statements of solidarity
  preceded recognition as the Palestinian issue was seen as emblematic of the
  struggles of so many postcolonial Black countries, and indeed that of Black
  emancipation movements in general. The Black Panther Stokely Carmichael
  referred to Palestine as “the tip of Africa”. In a speech to the UN general
  assembly in 1994, Thomas Sankara, the president of Burkina Faso, said: “I
  think of the valiant Palestinian people, the families which have been
  splintered and split up and are wandering throughout the world seeking asylum.
  The Palestinians remind us all of the need and moral obligation to respect the
  rights of a people.” And, of course, Palestine connected with the longest
  independence struggle of all – South Africa, where Mandela viewed Palestine as
  not just similar but crucial to a broader global liberation. *** ‘Organically
  linked’ political synergy In Africa, in particular, sympathy with Palestine
  developed not out of knee-jerk relatability but as a result of events. In the
  1950s and 60s, Israel, which was established in 1948, attempted to cast itself
  as one of a rising number of countries shaking off the yoke of imperialism and
  establishing new, idealistic states. In doing so, it made inroads in the
  global south in general, and Africa, as the country attempted to
  counterbalance hostility from its Arab neighbours. But the wars of 1967 and
  1973 sharpened the contours of Palestinian dispossession, as millions were
  displaced and their lands occupied, and Israel seized land in Egypt, Syria and
  Jordan. This period was a turning point that, according to Dahlia El Zein, a
  historian of the modern Middle East and Africa, marked “the decline of
  Israel’s influence in Africa”, and alienated Israel from themes of
  postcolonial struggle, situating it on the other side of liberation movements.
  By the mid-70s, Palestine’s place at the heart of the postcolonial movement
  was entrenched. The precursor to the African Union, the Organisation of
  African Unity, stated in 1975 that “the racist regime in occupied Palestine
  and the racist regime in Zimbabwe and South Africa have a common imperialist
  origin … being organically linked in their policy aimed at repression of the
  dignity and integrity of the human being”. *** Parallel struggles against
  imperialism As political challenges evolved from battling with imperialism and
  its aftermath to establishing civil rights and anti-racism movements in the
  Black diaspora, so did solidarity with Palestine. If Palestine was the tip of
  Africa for the Black Panthers, it also occupied a similar position in the
  political geography of contemporary anti-racism activists. Palestine
  interlocked with everything from diaspora labour union organisations, such as
  the UK’s Caribbean Labour Solidarity, to national and even international
  anti-racism movements such as Black Lives Matter. Years before the
  globalisation of the BLM protests in the summer of 2020, the movement’s
  organisers made the ending of Palestinian occupation a central demand, as well
  as advanced the adoption of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement
  against Israel. At a 2021 protest for Palestine in New Jersey, Zellie Thomas,
  an organiser with Black Lives Matter, invoked the visceral familiarity some
  Black Americans felt with Palestinians. “We know occupation. We know
  colonisation, we know police brutality,” he said. *** Gaza and a new era of
  solidarity The unfolding genocide in Gaza, combined with the accelerating
  violence of settlers in the West Bank, has only validated and solidified the
  solidarity of those who, for generations, have seen how Palestine intersects
  with the violent structure of apartheid and the brutality of police and
  security forces. And it has further strengthened the Palestinian cause, making
  it not one of abstract ideology but a crisis demanding urgent intervention due
  to the role of western powers, particularly the US, in supporting Israel’s
  assault. It was South Africa, a country with the most vivid and brutal
  experience of apartheid and segregation – and western enabling of that system
  – that brought the case against Israel at the international court of justice,
  in which it demanded that protections against genocide of the Palestinians be
  applied. And in the diaspora, most crucially in the US, the prime sponsor of
  Israel, Palestine continues to reach new points of resonance. Last year,
  Ta-Nehisi Coates, the most celebrated Black writer on racism and reparations
  in the US, published The Message, a book in which he critiques Israel and
  places it firmly in the camp of his own country, whose racist history he knows
  so well. Coates said the “closest analogue” he could think of when he visited
  the occupied Palestinian territories was “the time in which the United States
  of America referred to itself as a democracy, even as it was disenfranchising
  whole swaths of Black people in the southern states. And so, when I say Jim
  Crow, when I say segregation, that is because that is the period that
  immediately comes to mind for me.” Perhaps this is why it has taken so long
  for western countries to recognise Palestine. Perhaps it is only when you can
  identify with the victims, when their fate speaks to your history and your
  lived experience, that solidarity becomes a spontaneous moral instinct rather
  than a political calculation. • To receive the complete version of The Long
