  Leeds were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by a callow shadow side fielded by
  the Championship’s crisis club Sheffield Wednesday after a dramatic penalty
  shootout. After failing to put away in 90 minutes a side whose outfield
  players had an average age of 20, Leeds succumbed in the spot-kick lottery.
  The Owls goalkeeper Ethan Horvath saved from Joël Piroe and Sean Longstaff and
  in between Dominic Calvert-Lewin put his penalty over the bar and into a
  deserted Kop to hand Wednesday a logic-defying win. It took a late goal from
  Jayden Bogle, on as a substitute, to take the tie that far after a second-half
  own goal from the Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow – branded a “calamity” by the
  manager, Daniel Farke – had gifted the Owls the lead. The home side held their
  nerve to seize their big moment in front of a crowd of just 7,801 at
  Hillsborough with many of Wednesday’s disgruntled supporters boycotting the
  game in protest against the stewardship of the owner, Dejphon Chansiri. They
  may reflect they chose the wrong fixture after the Owls dispatched their
  Yorkshire rivals. “They were absolutely on the limit today, but they kept on
  going and this is the mentality, this is the hunger, this is the big heart we
  can be so proud of,” the Wednesday manager, Henrik Pedersen, said. “They are
  proud to play in our club, they are thankful to go on this pitch and do all
  that they can for the shirt and for the club. I’m really proud about this
  performance tonight.” Chansiri’s reluctance to sell the club until the asking
  price he wants is met has left them in limbo after a summer of missed payments
  to staff, player departures and fee restrictions being placed on transfers by
  the EFL. Whether it will make any difference only time will tell but the
  boycott succeeded in lending the occasion a strange backdrop. Hillsborough
  effectively became an away ground for Wednesday. While both clubs made nine
  changes from their respective league appointments last weekend, it was
  anything but a like-for-like swap. Daniel Farke was able to introduce
  £50m-worth of his Leeds summer signings as Pedersen was forced to call on five
  teenagers from the Owls academy. For two of them – defender Cole McGhee and
  striker George Brown – it was their first taste of senior football. Indeed, of
  the 241 league starts accrued by Wednesday’s outfield players, 234 of them
  belonged to one player – captain Jamal Lowe. Leeds predictably monopolised
  possession but it was to an energetic Wednesday’s credit that even though they
  lost Gabriel Otegbayo with a leg injury before the break they were still able
  to reach the interval on level terms. Lowe was only inches away from giving
  the home side the lead in added time with a free-kick that curled just wide.
  With Leeds still unable to break the deadlock as the second half wore on,
  Farke called for back-up. Willy Gnonto and Calvert-Lewin – on his debut for
  the Premier League side– were sent on just before the hour. But on a rare raid
  upfield, Lowe drove across a shot right-footed from a tight angle and Darlow
  succeeded only in fumbling the ball into his own net. A brilliant double save
  from Horvath thwarted first Noah Okafor and then Gnonto as Leeds pressed for
  an equaliser. It finally came in the 81st minute as Gnonto worked in Bogle and
  the right-back finished low and hard. Leeds pressed for a late winner but
  Calvert-Lewin stabbed an added‑time chance wide with his calf and was then
  twice denied by Horvath before Wednesday sealed a famous win from the spot.
  “It hurts as we were the favourites,” Farke said. “It was never going to be a
  walk in the park. It’s always tricky when you make so many changes but we have
  to take the criticism. You feel a bit embarrassed as a Premier League side. We
  want to say sorry to our fans who made the trip.”
