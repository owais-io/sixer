  pleasurable Austen adaptation

  Emma Thompson won a screenplay Oscar for this buoyant, vibrant, richly
  enjoyable adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel. Released in 1995, it was directed
  by Ang Lee and is a movie with the pleasures of a golden age studio picture of
  the kind made by William Wyler. It was the second half of Thompson’s Oscar
  double – she won her first one in 1993 for acting in Howards End – and she is
  still the only person in Academy Award history to win for acting and writing.
  With marvellous lightness and gaiety, Thompson found a response to Austen’s
  comic register, expertly marrying it up to the romance, and 1995 now looks
  like the golden age of Austen adaptation, having also seen the Colin
  Firth/Jennifer Ehle Pride and Prejudice on television and Amy Heckerling’s
  Emma-homage Clueless at the movies. Thompson paid due attention to Austen’s
  unique and toughly realistic concern with money and status – but on this more
  serious point, perhaps a rerelease is also due for Patricia Rozema’s very
  worthwhile interpretation of Mansfield Park from 1999, a darker and more
  political take on Austen. Sense and Sensibility is a film stuffed with
  blue-chip British acting talent but, for me, Kate Winslet is the movie’s
  beating heart as the spirited and innocent Marianne Dashwood, younger sister
  of the more sober Elinor, played outstandingly by Thompson herself. With their
  widowed mother (Gemma Jones) and little sister Margaret, played by Myriam
  François, the sisters find themselves evicted from their handsome estate due
  to a technicality of their late father’s will and forced to occupy a modest
  cottage elsewhere. This film delivers the keynote generic moments: the formal
  ball in which dialogue is exchanged in the middle of silly dance moves, the
  secret engagement and the whispered gossip about wealth and projected annual
  income. The houses are, of course, grand and even the Dashwoods’ cottage
  doesn’t look too awful. There is a tree house that looks staggeringly big. It
  is in her relatively reduced circumstances that Elinor encounters the
  personable Edward Ferrars, brother to the spiteful and grasping Fanny
  Dashwood, the sisters’ relative by marriage played with vinegary glee by
  Harriet Walter. Hugh Grant brings a coolly underplayed star power to the role
  of Edward; he has a hilariously diffident way of entering a room and a
  generally comic manner that Austen surely can’t have imagined, but which works
  tremendously well. (Thompson invents for Edward and Elinor a tremendous gag
  about the location of the Nile.) As for Marianne, she is bowled over by the
  bounderish Willoughby who is to shatter her heart, a role that Greg Wise made
  immortal (and his real-life marriage to Thompson is an extra-textual romance
  that has helped to make the film iconic). But there to heal Marianne’s heart
  is the manly and reticent Colonel Brandon, played by Alan Rickman with pride,
  decency and slot-mouthed hauteur. Brandon is the third character in this film
  with a broken heart, having fallen for Marianne only to see her infatuated
  with the awful Willoughby, but it’s a lump-in-the-throat moment when Marianne,
  recovering from her near fatal illness, sees how the devoted Brandon has
  brought her mother to see her and thanks him from her sickbed. As for these
  men, well, it’s Colonel Brandon who has the estate and Edward Ferrars is
  content with the relatively modest clergyman’s living. God is not otherwise
  mentioned, other than in Marianne’s astonished encounter with her faithless
  suitor in London: “Good God, Willoughby!” So the double wedding is a
  compromise between marrying for love and for something more material, and
  finds there is no great problem in balancing the two. • Sense and Sensibility
  is in UK cinemas from 8 August, and Australian cinemas from 10 August
