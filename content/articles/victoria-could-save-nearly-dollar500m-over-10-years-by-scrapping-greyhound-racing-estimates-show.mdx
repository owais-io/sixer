  The Victorian government could save almost half a billion dollars if it
  follows Tasmania in phasing out greyhound racing in the state, according to
  independent analysis. A policy costing by the Parliamentary Budget Office
  (PBO), to be released on Thursday, estimates the government would save $451.6m
  between 2025-26 and 2035-36 if it stopped subsidising greyhound racing and
  closed the industry. The figure is based on an estimated $687.4m drop in
  government spending on the industry over the decade, offset by a $235.8m loss
  in revenue, as Victorians would no longer be able to bet on greyhound races
  held in the state. The analysis said the government “increased ongoing
  support” to the entire Victorian racing industry, which includes thoroughbred
  and harness racing, in 2024. This was through a higher point of consumption
  tax on wagering revenue, which was increased to 15% from 10%, with half of the
  revenue going to racing, and a funding deed providing $90m annually. The PBO
  analysis didn’t factor in the “risk or cost of potential legal claims against
  the Victorian government” from breaking agreements, such as current racing
  club or racecourse licences or its wagering contract with Tabcorp. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The report was commissioned by Animal Justice party MP
  Georgie Purcell, who said she was “not surprised” but “absolutely appalled” to
  learn how much the Victorian government was subsiding the industry. “For this
  government to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars supporting the
  greyhound racing industry while they fail to fund the operation of new women’s
  crisis shelters, fail to meet their Gonski requirement, fail to adequately
  fund mental health care and fail to properly support regional Victorians is
  frankly astounding,” Purcell said. She said according to the Coalition of
  Protection of Greyhounds, which collects publicly available stewards’ reports
  after meets, 29 dogs have died on racetracks in Victoria this year.
  “Meanwhile, Tasmania has made a principled and ethical decision after one dog,
  their Greyhound of the Year, was killed on July 28,” Purcell said. “It
  certainly says a lot about the direction of the Victorian Labor government
  when even the Liberals are doing better than them on animal protection.” The
  Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, on Sunday announced his Liberal government
  would end funding for greyhound racing in the state by 2029, effectively
  winding up the industry. In May, a report by economist Saul Eslake into the
  Tasmanian greyhound industry found the state government funded the sport “more
  generously than any other jurisdiction, to the tune of $12.70 per head of
  population in 2023-24”. This includes by returning 80% of revenue from its
  point of consumption tax to racing. Eslake told Guardian Australia greyhound
  racing “likes to style itself as an industry” but relies on the “public purse”
  in most states. “We don’t talk about the football industry or the basketball
  industry or the tennis industry,” he said. “Racing likes to call itself an
  industry, so maybe its claims ought to be tested in the same way as when
  another industry comes along wanting a handout. It should be subject to the
  same rigorous scrutiny.” The Victorian racing minister, Anthony Carbines, on
  Monday said he had no plans to end greyhound racing in the state, describing
  the Tasmanian government’s announcement as a “desperate” attempt to secure the
  support of crossbench MPs after failing to win a majority at the recent state
  election. “No one’s safe in Tasmania. Throw everyone overboard to form a
  majority,” Carbines said. He said greyhound racing generated $850m a year in
  economic activity and employed almost 5,000 people in full-time work in
  Victoria. “The government here in Victoria backs greyhound racing,” Carbines
  said. In a statement, Greyhound Racing Victoria chief executive, Stuart Laing,
  said the Victorian economy “would be significantly worse off” without the
  industry. “What the PBO costing doesn’t include are the direct income taxes on
  those who are employed within in greyhound racing, the payroll and corporate
  income taxes levied and net GST generated by businesses operating in greyhound
  racing, and other taxes and levies such as fringe benefits tax, land tax and
  other taxes generated from participants who spend money in their involvement
  in greyhound racing,” he said. In 2018, the ACT banned greyhound racing. New
  South Wales proposed a ban in 2016 before the then premier, Mike Baird,
  backflipped after a backlash. Last year, an inquiry into the industry in the
  state was called, after allegations of widespread animal abuse. • This article
  was amended on 14 August 2025 to include a statement from Greyhound Racing
  Victoria, which was received after publication.
