  The father of a New Zealand woman who has been held in a US immigration
  detention centre for three weeks with her six-year-old son is hopeful the pair
  will be released by the end of the week. US Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) detained Sarah Shaw and her youngest son after they
  attempted to re-enter the US from Canada on 24 July. Shaw had just dropped her
  two eldest children at Vancouver airport, so they could take a direct flight
  back to New Zealand for a holiday with their grandparents, when her father,
  Rod Price, received a panicked phone call. “She went to go back across into
  the US and then I got a frantic call to say that she’s being detained and
  ‘they’re about to take my phone off me’ and ‘they’re locking me up for the
  night’,” Price told local broadcaster RNZ. On Thursday, her friend Victoria
  Besancon told the Guardian that Shaw had received documents indicating she
  would be released, but the immigration centre was yet to verify the details to
  Shaw’s lawyer. Price was feeling confident and said there was a “90% chance”
  Shaw would be released on Friday afternoon, New Zealand time. Ice confiscated
  Shaw’s phone and transported her and her son to a Dilley immigration
  processing centre in south Texas, many states away from her home in Washington
  state, Besancon said on Wednesday. The ordeal had been “horrible”, Besancon
  said. “It really is kind of like being in jail ... it has been absolutely
  devastating and it’s kind of barbaric.” Shaw has what is known as a “combo
  card”– a temporary immigration document that includes employment
  authorisation, which she obtained through her employment at a maximum-security
  juvenile facility, and an I-360 approval, which can grant immigration status
  to domestic violence survivors. Shaw, who has lived in Washington for more
  than three years, had recently received a letter confirming her “combo card”
  renewal, not realising that the I-360 element of her visa was still pending
  approval. Shaw’s lawyer, Minda Thorward, told local media in Seattle that it
  was a simple administrative error and border patrol had the discretion to
  parole her into the US. Her children, meanwhile, had the correct travel
  documents to enter the US. “There was absolutely no reason for [her son] to be
  detained. It’s unconscionable,” Thorward said. New Zealand’s foreign affairs
  ministry said it was in contact with Shaw but could not comment further on the
  case due to privacy issues. “When someone with an expired parole leaves the
  country and tries to re-enter the US, they will be stopped in compliance with
  our laws and regulations,” a spokesperson for US customs and border protection
  (CBP) said in a statement to the Guardian. “If they are accompanied by a
  minor, CBP will follow all protocols to keep families together or arrange care
  with a legal guardian. Immigration law will be enforced, and our officers and
  agents will act accordingly.” A spokesperson for Ice said the agency “takes
  its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our
  custody very seriously”. Shaw’s case is the latest in a growing list of
  foreigners facing interrogation, detainment and deportations at the US border,
  including a British tourist, three Germans Lucas Sielaff, Fabian Schmidt and
  Jessica Brösche, and a Canadian and an Australian who were each held and then
  deported, despite having valid work visas.
