  Germany’s Vincent Keymer, 20, has laid down a marker for the 2026 world
  candidates and title match by routing some of India’s best grandmasters at the
  Quantbox GM tournament in Chennai, the heartland of the Olympiad champions and
  the home of the world champion, Gukesh Dommaraju. Keymer’s score was an
  unbeaten 7/9, while his winning margin was a full two points. In contrast,
  India’s Arjun Erigaisi finished third on tie-break and dropped from No 4 to No
  6 in the Fide live ratings, while Vidit Gujrathi, a 2024 world title
  candidate, had a minus score. Since 2024, when the nation’s men and women’s
  teams won double gold at the Budapest Olympiad while Gukesh became the
  youngest ever world champion at 18, India has been the undisputed top chess
  nation. However, Gukesh, who has struggled this summer on the St Louis-based
  Grand Chess Tour, started badly this week in the tour’s main event, the
  $350,000 Sinquefield Cup, which can be followed live daily from 7.30pm. Gukesh
  lost easily to his main rival, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, in a Nimzo-Indian 1
  d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 which soon transposed to a Queen’s Gambit Accepted.
  Ivan Sokolov, the elite trainer, summarised the game: “Pragg [finally]decided
  not to fight Gukesh on his turf, not to enter chaotic positions [where
  calculation decides]. Result – Pragg’s technical masterpiece!” Gukesh, who
  later described his defeat as “probably one of the worst games I’ve played”
  erred early with 13…Ba7? instead of 13…Be7, and the Stockfish evaluations told
  the story: by move 17 White was +1.26, by move 24 +2.24, by move 28 + 3.02,
  and by move 36 +5.01. Round two went better for Gukesh, who defeated the
  tailender Nodirbek Abdusattorov, but after four rounds he remained on a modest
  50% total. After four of the nine Sinquefield Cup rounds, the US champion and
  world No 3, Fabiano Caruana, led with 3/4, half a point ahead of Levon Aronian
  (US) and Praggnanandhaa. Praggnanandhaa, meanwhile, advanced to No 4 in the
  live ratings, his highest yet. Keymer and Praggnanandhaa are the two players
  in form among the world top 10, both with gains of 30+ rating points in the
  past year. Keymer’s success at Chennai crossed two significant career
  milestones , as he reached the world top 10 Fide live-rated players for the
  first time, and his rating passed the 2750 mark. The German made his career
  breakthrough in February when he won the $200,000 Weissenhaus Freestyle Grand
  Slam ahead of the world top two, defeating Magnus Carlsen in the semi-final
  and Caruana in the final. Keymer is the first German to reach the world top 10
  since the late Robert Hübner, whose peak was No 3 in 1980. His ambition now is
  to qualify for the 2026 candidates, then to win the candidates and become
  Gukesh’s challenger. Keymer has an individual playing style. He considers
  strategic risk assessment to be very important, deciding when to deviate from
  the most objectively sound moves so as to maximise his chances of provoking
  errors from his opponent. He points out that this is how today’s young GMs
  differ from their predecessors, who in a field of 2750s would aim for plus two
  and no defeats, whereas in the past two years Erigaisi has reached 2800 in
  Opens by playing for a win in every game. The German’s career has progressed
  more slowly than some of his contemporaries and rivals, owing to his
  commitment to completing his education rather than going straight into
  full-time chess. He has even needed to take school written and oral exams
  immediately before major tournaments. His parents are professional musicians,
  living in a small town an hour’s drive from Frankfurt, and before he
  discovered chess he seemed set to follow them, winning first prize as a
  pianist in a Youth for Music competition. In a previous generation, chess and
  music had a stronger connection. The world champion Vasily Smyslov and title
  candidate Lajos Portisch sang to professional standards, while Mark Taimanov,
  Bobby Fischer’s 6-0 victim, alternated as a grandmaster and a concert pianist.
  Keymer’s chess career took off in 2018 when, aged 13, he won the Grenke Open
  ahead of 49 GMs with a 2796 performance. He is helped by his long-term coach,
  Peter Leko, whose deep chess understanding is apparent in his online
  commentaries. As Keymer explained to the editor of New In Chess, Dirk Jan ten
  Geuzendam, in a recent interview: his model is Carlsen, Norway’s world No 1,
  who is “very, very classical. His knowledge about past games and structures is
  unmatched.” The Indians, in contrast, “work a lot, the amount of knowledge
  they have is huge, but most of that is not classical games, it is puzzles and
  calculation exercises. That’s what they grew up with, while I developed using
  a more classical approach, watching DVDs with the best games of all time.” It
  is still an outside chance, but Keymer may have an opportunity to change the
  seemingly inexorable course of chess history by advancing further into the
  world top 10, succeeding Carlsen as western European and world No 1, and
  defying the now conventional forecasts that chess in the 2020s and 2030s will
  be dominated by Indian, Chinese and central Asian grandmasters. 3986 1…Ng4! 2
