  The government has “got the balance right” on tax, Rachel Reeves has insisted
  after a former Labour shadow chancellor said she should consider introducing a
  wealth tax. The chancellor said she had already increased taxes on the
  wealthiest in society with higher levies “on private jets, on second homes,
  and increased capital gains tax”. Speaking to reporters in Scotland, Reeves
  said: “In the budget last year, we got rid of the non-domicile status in our
  tax system, so people who make Britain their home have to pay their taxes
  here. “I think we’ve got the balance right in terms of how we tax those with
  the broadest shoulders, but any further decisions will be ones that are made
  at a budget in the normal way.” Reeves was speaking after Anneliese Dodds, who
  resigned as a Foreign Office minister earlier this year over aid cuts, said
  ministers should “look carefully” at proposals for a one-off levy on
  millionaire households. In an interview with the Guardian, Dodds, who served
  as Keir Starmer’s shadow chancellor in opposition, pointed to the work of the
  economist Arun Advani. In 2020, Advani’s wealth tax commission recommended a
  one-off 1% levy on household wealth above £1m as a better way of raising
  revenue than taxing workers and consumers. Asked about Dodds’ suggestion,
  Reeves said: “The No 1 priority of this government is to grow the economy …
  We’ve got to get the balance right on taxation because we want that
  investment, we want those jobs to come here.” Government sources argued there
  was “not a proposition for a wealth tax on the table” and pointed to numerous
  examples where a wealth tax had not worked in other countries. “Clever people
  and all the economists are saying it doesn’t work,” one source said. Speaking
  to Sky News’ Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Dodds said the Treasury should
  consider the evidence from the wealth tax commission, which had “looked at all
  of that evidence [on wealth taxes] and set out how it would be possible to
  deliver something like that in a UK context”. “We’ve seen the deputy leader of
  the Labour party, for example, put forward suggestions. I think it’s important
  for all of those to be considered now,” she said. Different ministers have
  expressed conflicting views on proposals for a wealth tax. Earlier on Friday,
  Diana Johnson, the crime and policing minister, said it was “important … that
  all these issues are looked at and discussed and we look at the evidence about
  what will work and what won’t”. Last week, Jonathan Reynolds, the business
  secretary, dismissed the idea of a “magic” wealth tax as “daft” and told his
  colleagues to “get serious”. Reynolds told GB News that a tax like that
  “doesn’t exist anywhere in the world. Switzerland has a levy, but they don’t
  have capital gains or inheritance tax. “We’re not going to do anything daft
  like that. And I say to people: ‘Be serious about this’ … What if your wealth
  was not in your bank account, [what if it was] in fine wine or art? How would
  we tax that? This is why this doesn’t exist. “There’s a lot of populism out
  about this, and I’m frustrated to see it. I see colleagues sometimes say this
  in parliament and I say: ‘Come on, get serious.’”
