  Good morning. Planning is under way to send national guard troops to Chicago,
  an official at the Pentagon confirmed to ABC News on Sunday. Earlier on
  Sunday, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader and New York Democratic
  congressman, said Donald Trump had “manufactured a crisis” to justify sending
  federalized national guard troops into Chicago next, over the heads of local
  leaders. The national guard is normally under the authority of the individual
  states, deployed at the request of the state governor and federalized –
  deployed by the federal government – only in a national emergency and at the
  request of a governor. What did the government say? “We won’t speculate on
  further operations. The department is a planning organization and is
  continuously working with other agency partners on plans to protect federal
  assets and personnel,” a Department of Defense official said, according to
  ABC. Is the White House planning to send national guard troops to any other
  states? Pentagon officials confirmed to Fox News that up to 1,700 men and
  women of the national guard were poised to mobilize in 19 mostly Republican
  states to support Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown. Epstein accuser Virginia
  Giuffre’s memoir to be published posthumously The posthumous memoir of
  Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent accusers, will be
  published in the autumn, a publisher has announced. Giuffre had been working
  on Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, with
  the award-winning author and journalist Amy Wallace before her death earlier
  this year. The 400-page book will be released on 21 October, according to the
  Associated Press. Giuffre had completed the manuscript before she took her own
  life in April, the publisher Alfred A Knopf said. What did Giuffre say about
  the book? Giuffre wrote to Wallace 25 days before her death, stating that it
  was her “heartfelt wish” the memoir be released “regardless” of her
  circumstances. “The content of this book is crucial, as it aims to shed light
  on the systemic failures that allow the trafficking of vulnerable individuals
  across borders,” the email reads. Russia accuses Ukraine of strike on nuclear
  plant in wave of drone attacks Moscow has accused Kyiv of launching dozens of
  drone attacks, including one that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant, as
  Ukrainians marked 34 years since the country gained independence from the
  Soviet Union. The drone attack on the Kursk nuclear power plant in western
  Russia, 37 miles (60km) from the border with Ukraine, caused damage to an
  auxiliary transformer and forced a 50% reduction in the operating capacity of
  a reactor, Russian authorities said. Ukraine did not immediately comment on
  the alleged attack. What was the impact of the attack at the nuclear plant?
  The fire sparked by the drone, which was shot down, had been extinguished and
  there were no casualties or increased radiation levels, a spokesperson for the
  plant said on Sunday. In other news … Israeli aircraft and tanks have pounded
  the eastern and northern outskirts of Gaza City, destroying buildings and
  homes, as Israeli leaders vowed to press on with an expanded large-scale
  offensive on the city. Wildfires in California wine country and central Oregon
  grew overnight, prompting hundreds of evacuations as firefighters worked
  yesterday to try to contain the blazes amid dry, hot weather. France summoned
  the US ambassador Charles Kushner after he wrote a letter to President
  Emmanuel Macron alleging France had failed to do enough to stem antisemitic
  violence, a French foreign ministry spokesperson said yesterday. A Greenlandic
  mother’s one-hour-old baby was removed from her by Danish authorities after
  she underwent “parenting competence” tests – despite a new law banning the use
  of the controversial psychometric assessments on people with Greenlandic
  backgrounds. Don’t miss this: ‘I would not feel safe’: Americans on the sorrow
  – and relief – of leaving Trump’s US for Europe Since Trump’s return to power,
  relocation firms from London to Lisbon and Madrid to Milan say they’ve seen a
  surge in the number of inquiries from Americans. Undaunted by the gains made
  by the far right across the continent, many Americans cite a desire to escape
  the US’s increasingly polarised climate and an administration whose wide range
  of targets has included immigrants, diversity measures and political
  opponents. … or this: How to save the American university It is no secret that
  American universities are in the fight of a lifetime. With billions of dollars
  in federal support on the line, their ability to fund their research
  activities is clearly at stake. This is how they can survive – with their
  souls intact. Climate check: States vow to fight Trump official’s stop-work
  order on offshore wind farm The Democratic governors of Rhode Island and
  Connecticut promised on Saturday to fight a Trump administration order halting
  work on a nearly complete wind farm off their coasts that was expected to be
  operational next year. The Revolution Wind project was about 80% complete,
  with 45 of its 65 turbines already installed. Last Thing: Medvedev’s
  match-point meltdown sparks chaotic scenes at US Open The US Open descended
  into chaos yesterday when a photographer came on to the court as Daniil
  Medvedev faced matchpoint, bringing the first-round match to a standstill and
  sparking a spectacular meltdown from the Russian. Sign up First Thing is
