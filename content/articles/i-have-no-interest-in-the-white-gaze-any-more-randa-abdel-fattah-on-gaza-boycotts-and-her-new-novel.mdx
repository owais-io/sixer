  In 2021, when Randa Abdel-Fattah began working on her latest novel,
  Discipline, she questioned whether a story about state violence, the right to
  protest and the racialisation of Arab youth in Australia would resonate.
  Suspicion of Arab communities – particularly young Muslim men – in media and
  political commentary had been potent in the years after 9/11 and had formed
  the subject of her academic research (and her 2022 nonfiction book Coming of
  Age in the War on Terror) – but, she says, the issue seemed to have “fallen
  off the radar”. She wondered whether people still thought it was a problem
  deserving of attention, and even emailed her publisher in September 2023 to
  ask if it believed there was a market for the novel. “Then October happened
  and, honestly, fiction could not keep up with fact,” she says. Watching the
  genocide unfold in Gaza after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 left
  Abdel-Fattah creatively paralysed. As the relentless, live-streamed
  bombardment continued, the book was put on hold. But as the days and months
  rolled on, crackdowns on protests, freedom of speech and political expression
  gave her impetus to revive the work, and it morphed into a tale with profound
  new resonance in a nation where pro-Palestinian sentiment is being fought
  privately, and publicly, like never before. “It just all poured out,”
  Abdel-Fattah says. “I deliberately decided that I would just focus on academia
  and media as the two most contested sites where this censorship was
  happening.” Abdel-Fattah has personal experience in both contested sites. In
  February a $830,000 Australian Research Council Future Fellowship grant she
  was using to create a digital archive of Arab activism in Australia since the
  1970s was suspended after sustained criticism from some Jewish groups, the
  Coalition and media outlets. An investigation into the use of the grant
  remains ongoing, with a decision due later this year. Sign up for our rundown

  And earlier this month she withdrew from Bendigo writers’ festival – where she
  had been invited to speak about Discipline – after a code of conduct was
  issued directing panellists to “avoid language or topics that could be
  considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful”. Speakers appearing on
  panels presented by La Trobe University were also told they must adhere to La
  Trobe University’s anti-racism plan, which contains a contentious definition
  of antisemitism. Abdel-Fattah was one of the first writers to withdraw from
  Bendigo, citing censorship concerns; within days, 53 participants had pulled
  out, resulting in a third of the program being cancelled. Discipline is set in
  Sydney during Ramadan 2021, a period when Israeli strikes on Gaza killed close
  to 300 people. It follows the intersecting lives of Hannah, a young newspaper
  journalist, and Ashraf, an academic, after the arrest of a student from a
  local Islamic school who is charged with terrorism offences after protesting
  against an Israeli weapons manufacturer. Discipline charts the different ways
  the two navigate censorship and the toll it takes on them. Abdel-Fattah wanted
  to “explore the idea of accountability – and that’s why I set it in May 2021,
  during Israel’s assault on Gaza”. If people had confronted the brutality of
  occupation and subjugation of Palestinians five years ago, she asks, “would we
  be in this moment now?” The novel is sprinkled with references to recent and
  historical events, and real people and places. Characters discuss Muna and
  Mohammed el-Kurd’s fight against displacement from their family home in the
  neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem, Israel’s Dahiya
  doctrine, and conditions at the Ein El Hilweh refugee camp in southern
  Lebanon, created in 1948. For those who have followed Israel’s decades-long
  illegal occupation of Palestine, the context – which many have pointed out has
  been lacking in media – is refreshing; for newcomers, it will be educational.
  The story, however, is uniquely of western Sydney. It pokes fun at the
  haphazard and inconsistent responses from Muslim organisations responding to
  media crises, and gives voice to the conflicting emotions felt by Arab
  Australians encountering their lives through “a lenticular lens” when
  witnessing the destruction of their homelands – moments of levity and
  frivolity butted up against brutality, violence and injustice. Abdel-Fattah
  does not hesitate when asked who the intended audience is. “I was writing it
  for my community,” she says. “I felt like this was my way to validate all the
  private messages and angst.” Unlike some of her previous young adult novels,
  which she concedes sought to appeal to white audiences, Abdel-Fattah says, “I
  have no interest in that white gaze any more.” To build Hannah’s world, she
  drew on the real experiences of journalists who confided to her their stories
  about racism and prejudice in Australian newsrooms, and their own encounters
  with censorship and apathy towards Palestine. At one point Hannah pitches a
  story about the domestic impact of Israel’s bombings on the Muslim diaspora
  and colleagues respond with vacant stares and furrowed brows. “Ignore it all
  during the cold violence of occupation and siege. But during the hot violence
  of bombs, wasn’t this the time to check in, ask how she was doing?” Hannah
  thinks. Abdel-Fattah also drew on her own experiences in academia and
  universities. “I wrote the book when I was myself being subjected to a lot of
  censorship and repression, and in a way, it was therapeutic,” she says. While
  she considers herself a writer first and foremost – because of the joy and
  catharsis it brings – it’s her activism and criticism of Zionism that has
  earned her powerful enemies and kept her name in the headlines over the last
  two years. Of the controversy at Bendigo, she says, “the irony is hilarious” –
  but the wave of support she experienced from fellow writers who also withdrew
  suggests there has been a shift, at least within the artistic community.
  “Bendigo felt like a turning point in terms of solidarity,” she says. “I
  didn’t ask anybody to withdraw … There was this momentum of people withdrawing
  of their own volition.” Abdel-Fattah wants all those who have not spoken up
  against the injustices inflicted on Palestine to confront the “violence of
  their silence”. The opening page of Discipline states: “I humbly dedicate this
  book to all the Palestinian academics and journalists killed in Gaza who would
  be alive now if academics and journalists in the West had spoken and acted
  when they had the chance.” Discipline by Randa Abdel-Fattah is out on 2
  September (UQP)
