  The Trump administration has accused the UK of backsliding on human rights
  over the past year, citing antisemitic violence and “serious restrictions” on
  free speech. The annual US state department assessment, which analyses human
  rights conditions worldwide, highlighted laws limiting speech around abortion
  clinics, as well as the way government officials “repeatedly intervened to
  chill speech” online after the 2024 Southport attack. The report stated: “The
  government sometimes took credible steps to identify and punish officials who
  committed human rights abuses, but prosecution and punishment for such abuses
  was inconsistent.” The report cited the “safe access zones” around abortion
  clinics, which it said “could include prohibitions on efforts to influence …
  even through prayer or silent protests”. Criticism over the handling of free
  speech – in particular relating to regulations on online hate speech – was
  also directed at the governments of Germany and France. A UK government
  spokesperson said: “Free speech is vital for democracy around the world,
  including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping
  our citizens safe.” The document, previously seen as the most comprehensive
  study of its kind, has been significantly rewritten and downscaled by the
  Trump administration, including in areas such as government corruption and
  LGBTQ+ rights. It spares criticism for US allies such as Israel and El
  Salvador while escalating disapproval of perceived foes such as Brazil and
  South Africa. The document was published after months of delay amid reports of
  internal dissent at the state department over its contents. It echoed claims
  previously voiced by the US vice-president, JD Vance. In February, he
  criticised the UK over a legal case in which a former serviceman, Adam
  Smith-Connor, who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in
  2022, was convicted of breaching the safe zone around the centre. In a wider
  attack on what he suggested was a shift away from democratic values across
  Europe, Vance claimed the “basic liberties of religious Britons, in
  particular” were under threat. Speaking at the Munich security conference,
  Vance said that the US’s “very dear friends the United Kingdom” appeared to
  have seen a “backslide in conscience rights”. Vance is taking a holiday in the
  Cotswolds in south-west England, an area that is becoming increasingly popular
  with the rich and famous. During the trip, he has been hosted by David Lammy
  for talks about Gaza and other international affairs at the foreign
  secretary’s official residence, Chevening, in Kent. Vance also invited the
  Conservative shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, and the shadow home
  secretary, Chris Philp, to a meeting at the house where he is staying. The
  report also said the government “effectively” enforced laws around freedom of
  association and the rights of workers.
