  for school’

  The first song I fell in love with When I was a kid, my mom gave me her iPod,
  and I fell in love with all her music from the 70s and 80s. I’d sing Call Me
  by Blondie at the top of my lungs, jumping on the bed. What a great song. The
  first single I downloaded I was in [Disney sitcom] Shake It Up when I started
  falling in love with hip-hop. I went on a binge and discovered BedRock by
  Young Money. I was so obsessed that I ended up writing an essay about why I
  admire Lil Wayne for school. The song I know every lyric to I became obsessed
  with 6 Foot 7 Foot by Lil Wayne featuring Cory Gunz because of the music
  video. The incredible visuals made it easy to memorise the lyrics, even though
  he’s an incredibly fast rapper. The song I do at karaoke I don’t hate a lot of
  things in life, but I hate karaoke. The only time I did it, I did Driving Home
  for Christmas by Chris Rea, even though it was the middle of summer. The song
  I can no longer listen to Any of my exes’ music! The best song to play at a
  party I’m going to go with Bops by Coi Leray: “I got bops, yeah, yeah.” It’s
  just so good. She’s got bops. What else does she need to say? The song I
  secretly like I’ve never been much for pop in general, even though there’s
  some really great artists. My best friend really got me into Ballad of a
  Homeschooled Girl by Olivia Rodrigo. The best song to have sex to Pony by
  Ginuwine. The song that changed my life Yesterday by Atmosphere with Ant and
  Slug: “I thought I saw you yesterday / But I know it wasn’t you ’cos you
  passed away, Dad.” My father died when I was 10, so every time I hear that
  line, it’s kind of beautiful. The song that makes me cry You can feel both the
  indifference and the pain in XXXTentacion’s voice when he sings Changes. The
  song I’d play at my funeral I’m too superstitious for that one! The song that
  gets me up in the morning 10 Times by Stunna Girl. Why? Well, when you add it
  to your playlist, you’ll see what I mean! Thorne’s new film, Saint Clare, is
  available on UK streaming platforms now.
