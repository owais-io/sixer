  A Mass of Life review – magical and ecstatic Proms performance of Delius’s
  magnum opus

  It is 37 years since A Mass of Life was last done at the Proms, and that 1988
  outing was only the second complete Proms performance. The neglect is barely
  credible, and this outstanding occasion showed what audiences have been
  denied. If ever there was a piece ideally suited to the Royal Albert Hall it
  is Delius’s voluptuous 1905 magnum opus, with its double chorus, vast and
  sensuous orchestration, and the ecstatic affirmations of its Nietzsche text.
  And no conductor is more ideally suited to bringing all this together than the
  lifelong Delius advocate Mark Elder. Why the disregard? Partly, perhaps, the
  enduring boldness of Nietzsche’s atheist polemic Also Sprach Zarathustra, from
  which the text is culled. The main reason, though, is surely that Delius’s
  defiantly individual aesthetic – “a little intangible sometimes but always
  very beautiful”, as Elgar, no less, put it so well – remains a hard sell to
  audiences who want their music to have more obvious structure and progression.
  And yet few big pieces have a more clearcut beginning, middle and end than A
  Mass of Life. The opening summons leaps magnificently off the page. The
  atmospheric stillness at the start of the second part, with its distant horn
  calls – played high in the Albert Hall gallery – is a magical piece of
  writing. And the final chorus is an emphatic summation, admirably marshalled
  here by Elder to avoid any hint of bombast. Undeniably, the work has weaker
  moments, in which Delius’s music lingers less cogently. Yet few are without
  interest and none lacks artistry. The influence of Wagner’s Tristan und
  Isolde, philosophically as well as musically, is there. So is the echo of
  Delius’s exposure to African American singing in his Florida years. The
  orchestration is always alive with subtle changes of timbre and phrasing. All
  this was sensitively realised by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, with Alison
  Teale’s bass oboe providing a distinctive presence in the fine woodwind
  section. Among the vocal soloists, the baritone carries most of the weight,
  with Roderick Williams bringing clarity and taste to his marathon task.
  Jennifer Davis, Claudia Huckle and David Butt Philip showed they were not
  there to make up the numbers. The BBC Symphony Chorus and the London
  Philharmonic Choir never flagged. Surtitled translations of the German text
  were a good idea. But it was Elder who did most to make the case for A Mass of
  Life so conclusively. Why not a repeat in a year or two’s time? • Listen again
  on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September.
