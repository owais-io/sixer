  When Donald Trump’s Department of Justice requested the release of grand jury
  transcripts in criminal proceedings against sex-traffickers Jeffrey Epstein
  and Ghislaine Maxwell, the move did little to quiet an ever-growing chorus of
  critics frustrated by the US president’s backtracking over disclosing
  investigative files. Indeed, the justice department’s filings in this request
  revealed that only two law enforcement officers testified during grand jury
  proceedings in New York, undermining notions that unsealing them would reveal
  numerous truths. Manhattan federal court judge Paul Engelmayer recently
  rejected the justice department’s unsealing gambit and, in his decision, dealt
  yet another blow to the suggestion that grand jury documents would foster
  transparency about Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes and their social links to
  powerful figures such as Bill Clinton, Trump himself and many others. “Insofar
  as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped
  mine lode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates,
  they definitively are not that,” Engelmayer said, adding that anyone who
  expected new information to emerge from the documents “would come away feeling
  disappointed and misled”. “There is no ‘there’ there,” Engelmayer said in his
  written decision. In disabusing the possibility of bombshells in Maxwell’s
  grand jury transcripts, questions once again abound as to whether other
  investigative documents on Epstein will ever see the light of day – and
  whether there will be any political consequences for Trump if his justice
  department does not deliver them to a public increasingly convinced of a
  cover-up. Neama Rahmani, the founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former
  federal prosecutor, said the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI
  director, Kash Patel, have the legal power to release these other documents –
  but it might be politics that is keeping them from doing so. “They hold the
  key,” he said. “With a stroke of their pen, they can release the Epstein
  files.” Most of the Epstein files are not grand jury transcripts protected by
  sealing, Rahmani said. “There has to be a treasure trove of information that
  the Department of Justice has. “Members of the public [and] the media, they
  can’t compel the DoJ to release the information under a [Freedom of
  Information Act] request or anything similar, because there’s the law
  enforcement privilege, the deliberative process privilege,” Rahmani added.
  “The DoJ doesn’t have to make public its confidential files just because the
  public wants to, but they can certainly choose to do so. “Trump was
  inaugurated in January. Bondi has been AG for seven months now. How long does
  it take to go through these documents? “I think we’re waiting for something
  that’s never going to come to fruition.” Victims’ advocates have also noted
  that the Trump administration is capable of releasing these documents so that
  those whom Epstein and Maxwell preyed on can get justice. “For the last 20
  years the victims have always wanted the full disclosure of information
  regarding Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual-trafficking scheme. They have always
  wanted all individuals to be held accountable for their part in the sexual
  exploitation,” said Spencer Kuvin, the chief legal officer of Goldlaw, who has
  represented multiple Epstein victims. “The current administration has the
  power to release everything by merely signing an executive order. Instead of
  trying to help victims and expose sexual predators, they are more worried
  about protecting their friends who socialized with these criminals.” Analysts
  have voiced differing views on whether there is longterm political liability
  for Trump if the documents are not released. Susan MacManus, a professor
  emerita of political science at the University of South Florida, said there
  are several possibilities. Republicans might hope that people grow bored with
  the issue and start focusing on other subjects. A smaller cohort of
  ultra-conservative Republicans, however, is dissatisfied that the documents
  have not been released. “They’re disappointed in Trump because they think that
  there’s something hidden there, and they believe in transparency,” MacManus
  explained. Some Republicans might think that “ultimately, at least some of
  this stuff will come out”, implicating Democratic and Republican politicians
  alike. MacManus does not think that this issue will sway an election, however.
  “I see this as something that goes out of the picture and comes back in and
  goes out and comes back in,” MacManus said. “But I don’t think it’s enough to
  move somebody’s vote if they’re a Republican or if they’re a Democrat, they’re
  going to stick with their party.” Rick Wilson, the Lincoln Project co-founder
  and former Republican strategist, felt the document issue presented a dramatic
  problem for Trump. “I just feel like they’re in a really bad rut right now. I
  don’t think they’ve got an easy way out of this,” Wilson said. Wilson said
  that recent polling he’s conducted indicates that the controversy is not going
  away. “Americans, and Republicans in particular, are paying attention to this
  story because there is a ‘there’ there for them,” he said. Matt Terrill, a
  Republican strategist and managing partner of public affairs firm Firehouse
  Strategies, said that at the moment, interest in the issue has died down for
  the time being. Americans are focused on issues such as the economy, and many
  are on vacation. When Congress returns, however, Terrill expects the
  controversy will also return to the forefront, but that doesn’t mean the
  attention will be entirely on Trump. The House oversight committee subpoenaed
  Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as several former attorneys general and law
  enforcement officials, to testify about Epstein. “That could take the
  spotlight off President Trump,” he said. Even if this diverts attention from
  the president, Terrill said it would behoove the administration to be more
  open about whatever is going on. “There are many people in the Maga base who
  joined the Maga base because they want government transparency and they want
  accountability. They want justice and, for right or wrong, many people in the
  Maga base, and even those outside of the Maga base, feel as though they’re not
  getting that right now with this situation.” “So I do think it’s important, if
  you’re the administration, the Trump administration, to continue to put out
  everything you have in terms of this case,” he said. “If you can’t put things
  out, explain to the American people why you can’t put those things out.”
