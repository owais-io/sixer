  For almost a century, the beach-houses of Guardamar del Segura have held out
  against time and tide, change and development, offering a living snapshot of
  the early stirrings of tourism on Spain’s Costa Blanca. For decades, families
  from inland areas of Alicante province have come to the modest dwellings on
  Babilonia beach to spend the summer months together, eating, drinking,
  swimming and chatting. Enduring friendships and relationships have begun on
  their verandas and under their roofs. However, barring a last-minute reprieve,
  60 of the houses will be torn down in the middle of September after lengthy
  legal efforts to extend their land grants failed and their existence was
  blamed for worsening coastal erosion. The houses, made originally from wood
  and then from more durable materials, sprang up between the 1930s and 50s
  after decades of work to stop the sand dunes advancing towards the town of
  Guardamar del Segura. The authorities welcomed their construction, hoping that
  they would help serve as a barrier to the dunes. Before long, a summer
  neighbourhood evolved as families secured long-term land grants and built
  beach homes to which they returned annually. A few people live there all year
  round. “This has created a tight-knit community, now in its fifth generation,”
  said Víctor Sánchez, one of those battling to save the houses. “My best friend
  lives next door, his mother was friends with my uncle, his grandmother with my
  grandmother, and his six nieces are now building new friendships with my
  cousin’s three daughters.” Sánchez, who now lives in Essex, cherishes the
  annual trip back to Babilonia to catch up with friends and family. He said
  that unlike other parts of the Costa Blanca, such as Benidorm, the beach has
  not changed much since the long-gone summers when his mother and uncle used to
  travel there in a donkey-drawn cart. Many of its houses still look the way
  they did in the 1930s, complete with patios once intended for chicken coops,
  although the decor in his parents’ house, including the orange-tiled kitchen,
  dates from the 1970s. “I think if you talk about Mediterranean Spain, then
  everybody thinks about Benidorm and about high rises very close to the sea,”
  added Sánchez. “Lots of people on the beaches; everything’s packed. People
  from abroad or from Madrid and faraway towns. That’s the image. It is what it
  is. But it wasn’t like that here.” His memories are of small children heading
  out for morning swims, teenagers getting up later after long nights out, old
  men playing dominoes and neighbours stopping by to chat. But the idyll’s days
  are numbered. Legal efforts to extend the land grants – which ended in 2018 –
  have failed and Spanish courts have set the demolition date for 15 September.
  Spain’s environment ministry says the houses are built on one of the most
  valuable dune areas of the Mediterranean coastline, adding that their
  construction has disrupted sedimentary flows and caused serious erosion. “Even
  small storms affect the beach, making it increasingly difficult for the beach
  to recover its natural profile since the very existence of these buildings
  prevents the sea from accessing the sand reservoir in the enormous dune field
  located behind the buildings,” the ministry said in a statement. “This means
  that the beach cannot adopt a defensive profile against storms, leaving it
  completely unprotected from the waves.” It also notes that some owners have
  altered the beach by trying to shore up the area outside their houses with
  piles of stones. Sánchez and other members of the Playa Babilonia residents’
  association, who blame the erosion on the construction of a nearby breakwater
  in the mid-1990s, are pinning their hopes on a new coastal law drawn up by the
  regional government that offers special protection to seaside heritage sites.
  As the Valencian government’s environment minister has said, one of the aims
  of the law is “precisely to conserve the elements on our coast that deserve to
  be conserved – and areas of ethnological importance are one of the things we
  want to protect”. But the new legislation, as well as efforts to secure
  protected national heritage status for Playa Babilonia, may have come too
  late. If the houses are demolished next month, Sánchez and his neighbours fear
  the loss of more than just an important part of their lives and pasts. “The
  houses here don’t look like those in the rest of the Mediterranean,” he said.
  “They have different porches and pillars and they’re something you don’t see
  in other places. There, it’s all chalets with swimming pools and tennis courts
  that have given way to pádel courts. There’s no heart in any of that.”
