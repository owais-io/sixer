  David Rendall, who has died aged 76, was a singer whose bronzed but
  mellifluous tenorial tones sustained a career lasting 30 years until it was
  shortened by an onstage accident. He enjoyed successful runs at the major
  British houses – Covent Garden, English National Opera and Glyndebourne – as
  well as the Metropolitan, New York, but he was also dogged by misfortune.
  Progressing from lighter roles in Mozart and bel canto opera to weightier
  parts such as Don Alvaro in La Forza del Destino and Cavaradossi in Tosca, he
  finally attained the zenith of many a tenor’s aspirations, the title role in
  Otello, bringing to the part his characteristic combination of commanding
  tone, lyrical timbre and skilful phrasing. Of his performance at ENO in 1998,
  the critic of Opera magazine prophesied: “Given the right opportunities,
  Rendall’s Otello will surely bestride the world.” He did indeed go on to sing
  Otello at La Scala and Dresden, as well as Glyndebourne in 2001 and again four
  years later, but it was also in 2005 that there occurred a disastrous stage
  malfunction in a performance of Aida at the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen.
  Sealed in the underground tomb in the final act, he became aware of the stage
  above going sideways instead of up, resulting in the destruction of the set.
  “I was knocked down at least 15 feet”, he recalled, “and tried to crawl to
  safety to avoid being crushed.” The serious injuries he suffered required a
  hip replacement, with subsequent knee-joint replacement, and extensive
  shoulder surgery. His £250,000 claim for compensation against the theatre’s
  owners, the Danish Ministry of Culture, cited loss of earnings, on the basis
  that opera companies doubted his ability to achieve the same high standards as
  previously. He subsequently also sued the surgeon who performed the operation
  for using a controversial technique of “mixing and matching” hip replacement
  parts, seriously affecting his mobility. The Copenhagen incident was not the
  first time Rendall had been in the headlines for the wrong reasons. At a
  performance of Pagliacci in Milwaukee in 1998, the blade of the prop knife his
  character Canio was using to stab his unfaithful wife Nedda and her lover
  Silvio failed to retract. The baritone playing Silvio, Kimm Julian, narrowly
  escaped a possibly mortal injury. A farcical element was added when the police
  who had been called to the scene confused the plot of the opera recounted to
  them with the real-life scenario, and came to believe that Rendall himself was
  seeking revenge for a marital infidelity. He was finally released without
  charge. Rendall was born in London, the son of Phyllis (nee Tuffin), a nurse,
  and John Rendall, a stockbroker’s manager. As a teenager he was the vocalist
  of a covers band called All on Edge, but was working in the BBC’s gramophone
  library (as it was then called) when he was overheard by Roy Plomley and
  Ronald Cook, the presenter and producer of Desert Island Discs, singing Questa
  o quella (a castaway’s choice) from Rigoletto. Disapproving of the choice of
  singer, he had played the disc 10 to 12 times, by his own account, “learned
  the tune and a couple of the words”, went into the studio and put it down on
  tape. So impressed were Plomley and Cook, listening in an adjacent room, that
  they made contact on his behalf with two London conservatoires. He was offered
  a bursary at the Royal Academy of Music. His debut as a soloist was with
  Glyndebourne Touring Opera in 1975 as Ferrando in Così fan tutte. He graduated
  to the festival proper in the same role the following year, but was not to
  return until 1988 as Belmonte in Die Entführung aus dem Serail, followed by
  Tom Rakewell in The Rake’s Progress. Meanwhile at Covent Garden between 1975
  and 1990, he sang such roles as Count Almaviva, Massenet’s Des Grieux, Matteo
  in Arabella and Rodrigo in La Donna del Lago, while at ENO between 1976 and
  1992 he won acclaim as Leicester in Maria Stuarda, the Duke in Rigoletto,
  Rodolfo and Pinkerton. To all these roles he brought exemplary diction, an
  impressive legato line and a thrilling, though seemingly effortless, delivery.
  He also flourished at the Met, making his debut there as Ernesto in Don
  Pasquale (1980) and returning for 10 seasons to sing six of the principal
  Mozart tenor roles as well as Matteo, Lensky and David in Die Meistersinger.
  Deciding, with his second wife, the mezzo-soprano Diana Montague, that they
  would focus their careers on the UK and Europe, in order to enjoy family life
  with their children, Rendall thereafter declined many offers from America and
  elsewhere. In his enforced retirement he kept an entertaining blog retailing
  anecdotes from his life and career, including a temporary loss of sight after
  being struck on the temple by a singer playing Don Alfonso and an incident
  involving the New York police department when a dish of curry was emptied over
  the head of a restaurateur. The picture emerges of a colourful, combative
  character who, despite setbacks, lived life to the full. He is survived by
  Diana, and their three children, Eleanor, Amelia and Huw, and by two children,
  Edward and Elizabeth, from his first marriage, to Kathryn George, which ended
  in divorce. • David Rendall, tenor, born 11 October 1948; died 21 July 2025
