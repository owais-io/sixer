  Donald Trump’s special envoy is expected in Moscow days before the US
  president’s deadline on Friday for Russia to make progress on ending the war
  in Ukraine or face increased US sanctions. Trump said Steve Witkoff would
  visit Moscow on Wednesday or Thursday. When asked what message Witkoff would
  take to Russia and what Vladimir Putin could do to avoid new sanctions, the US
  president answered: “Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed.” In
  Kyiv, there is little expectation that Witkoff will make a breakthrough with
  Putin, but a hope that Trump’s changed rhetoric and tougher stance on Moscow
  may lead to a real change in US support for Ukraine. Sources in Kyiv said they
  expected Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, to visit the country towards
  the end of the week, possibly to coincide with Witkoff’s visit to Moscow.
  Trump came into office convinced he could do a deal with Putin, but in recent
  weeks appears to have become increasingly frustrated with Russia’s actions. On
  Thursday he described its continued attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine as
  “disgusting” and on Sunday said that two nuclear submarines that he ordered to
  be deployed after online threats from the former Russian president Dmitry
  Medvedev were now “in the region”, without giving further details. Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on social media: “The concept
  of peace through strength works.”He added that the appearance of the
  submarines had silenced Medvedev, whom he described as “one Russian drunk who
  had just been threatening nuclear war on X”. Trump had initially announced in
  July a 50-day deadline for Russia and Ukraine to end the war, but said last
  week he no longer believed Russia was serious about ending the war and
  shortened it to “10 or 12” days, later clarified as this Friday, 8 August.
  Trump has previously said the new measures he has in mind if the deadline is
  not met could involve “secondary tariffs” targeting Russia’s remaining trade
  partners, such as China and India. Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, said if Russia did not change its course by Friday, Kyiv would
  expect the “irreversible logistics” of secondary sanctions on Russian oil
  exports to be set in motion. “After that he’ll look whether this is helping to
  bring about the end of the war or not, and if not then he will move to the
  next step,” said Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv. The next move, he said,
  could be further sanctions, and the increased militarisation of Ukraine.
  “Trump has already said he’s ready to sell Europe as much weapons as they want
  [to pass to Ukraine]. Before he didn’t say that … This is already a different
  conception of the world,” he said. Before that, though, all eyes will be on
  Witkoff’s visit to Moscow. On previous trips, he has held long one-on-one
  meetings with Putin and has spoken of his warm feelings for the Russian
  leader. On one occasion Putin gifted him an oil painting of Trump, on another,
  Witkoff arrived without an interpreter and used a Kremlin-provided translator.
  The camaraderie has left both Kyiv and other US allies wondering whether
  Witkoff is capable of delivering harsh messages to Moscow, although his visit
  this week will be the first since Trump’s rhetoric on Ukraine became
  noticeably harsher. The Kremlin said on Monday it was “always happy to see Mr
  Witkoff in Moscow” and a meeting with Putin was possible, the spokesperson
  Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He described talks with Witkoff as “important,
  substantive and very useful”. Putin said on Friday that he was in favour of “a
  lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia
  and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries”. Despite
  periodically making such statements, Putin has also made clear that Russia’s
  maximalist war goals remain essentially unchanged, demanding as a minimum
  control over four Ukrainian regions to which Moscow has laid claim, and a
  commitment that Ukraine will never join Nato. Direct talks between Russia and
  Ukraine have taken place in Turkey, with the third round in Istanbul last
  month, but the last set of talks broke down in less than an hour and the only
  substantive outcome from the meetings has been a series of agreements on
  prisoner exchanges. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that a new exchange agreed at the
  last meeting in Istanbul would result in 1,200 Ukrainian troops returning
  home. Zelenskyy has said he wants to meet directly with Putin, with Trump or
  Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a mediator, but the Russian president has
  said he sees no point in a meeting until the outline of a ceasefire has been
  drawn up. However, the delegation he sent to Turkey, led by the former culture
  minister and patriotic author Vladimir Medinsky, suggests the Kremlin is not
  serious about a deal. “Those countries who thought Russia was ready for talks,
  and that the war could end at any moment if Ukraine would only agree to
  negotiations, they can now see that Russia is not ready for any real talks,”
  said Podolyak. Russia continues to target Ukraine with almost nightly drone
  and missile attacks. Last week was one of the deadliest for some time in terms
  of civilian casualties, with one set of attacks on Kyiv killing 31 people,
  including five children. Both sides continue to target infrastructure in the
  opposing country with drones. Russia’s ministry of defence said on Monday that
  its air defences had intercepted 61 Ukrainian drones overnight.
