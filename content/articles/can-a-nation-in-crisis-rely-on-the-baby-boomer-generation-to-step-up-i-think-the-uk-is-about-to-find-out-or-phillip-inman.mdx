  Dear baby boomer, the government is coming for you and your store of wealth.
  The property and pensions built up over the past 40 to 50 years are, for the
  first time, in play. The triple lock on the state pension might be guaranteed,
  at least for the time being, but for the wealthier boomer, it looks like their
  private assets are being laid out on a chopping board, ready to be carved like
  a Sunday roast and fed to hungry government departments starved of funds for
  almost two decades. These are desperate times and taxing the wealthy is a
  desperate measure. No government wants to do it. If you tax the rich, they
  might fly away in their private jets. That’s happened in Norway, one of the
  few European countries to retain a wealth tax. It’s true that older
  middle-income voters are more likely to stay put, but they also have a
  tendency to vote with their self-interest in mind. And because baby boomers
  are the most active age group on polling day – many of them among the richest
  in society – that has always spelled disaster for the party in government.
  There have been skirmishes in the past. This time it’s serious. Property
  wealth is the focus of the latest leaks from the Treasury. And there is a good
  reason why when the housing market is gridlocked and needs to be more
  flexible. The Treasury is considering changes to the tax regime that will
  shift the burden of council tax and the centuries-old property transaction
  charge – stamp duty land tax (SDLT) – towards more expensive homes. One
  proposal is less about an increase in the total amount of money raised from
  SDLT for the exchequer than encouraging more transactions. The payback for a
  heavier tax on the sale of more expensive homes is a discount on the charge
  applied to cheaper ones. As the average worker discovers that moving house
  involves paying less tax, they will be more likely to take work in a different
  area, boosting labour mobility and economic growth. With more economic growth
  comes higher tax receipts. Bingo. It’s true there will probably be more
  transactions in the short term. Unfortunately for property buyers, the
  experience of David Cameron and George Osborne’s help to buy scheme is that
  tax incentives are absorbed into a new higher price and the only winner is the
  seller. There should be a question mark over the plan when ministers consider
  why many people stay put, rather than sell. And, in particular, why those who
  have retired cling to the family home well into their late 70s, 80s and 90s.
  The UK’s 12 million over-65s should be the focus of any property tax debate,
  because they occupy a disproportionate share of family homes. According to a
  study by the research charity the Intergenerational Foundation using official
  data, the average 65-year-old lives in a home offering more than 65 sq metres
  of space per person. By contrast, those aged 30 to 44 have less than 40 sq
  metres to move around in. Homes with three or more bedrooms are in short
  supply and hundreds of thousands of them are owned by older people who only
  use a fraction of the space, except maybe when family members gather at
  Christmas and Easter. Resistance to selling is strong. Older people will have
  emotional ties to a property they have owned for a long time. And they will
  often defy the urging of their family to downsize when they consider all the
  filling of forms and anxiety connected with it. Yet more than anything,
  studies have shown downsizing is stymied by a lack of suitable properties –
  ones that are smaller and yet have features that make them attractive to
  people moving from large homes. Flats in modern tower blocks designed for
  young professionals are often narrow and cramped, ill suited to a buyer who is
  considering a last-ever property, one that can cope with a wheelchair. We
  could blame councils that fail to take into account older people whenever they
  consider public housing. And the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local
  Government does not seem to have the subject on its radar. Older people’s
  housing is strictly of the sheltered variety and the preserve of private
  providers such as Axa and McCarthy Stone. But dear boomer, you must accept
  that your inaction has consequences. There is very little demand for the flats
  and small homes that might fit your whole-life needs. It appears that all you
  want is to retire early and cash out, taking your accidental winnings with
  you. Accidental because they were only accrued as a consequence of you being
  born at the right time, when by sheer force of numbers, your generation pushed
  property and share prices higher. Boomers are the problem, but could also be
  the solution – and less of a target. If boomers gave more of their time to
  local communities rather than jetting off on several holidays a year, and if
  they moved out of their main homes in good time in favour of younger families,
  there might be less reason to pursue their wealth. The government is in a
  financial fix because the wheels of the economy are turning slowly. That’s
  been the case since the financial crash. But it doesn’t have to be. If
  better-off retirees demanded smaller, appropriate housing, the private sector
  would begin to provide it, home sales would increase and the economy turn at a
  faster lick. Otherwise the UK, like so many rich, ageing countries, will be
  stuck. If boomers cannot bring themselves to act collectively and
  patriotically for the greater good, as seems unlikely for many reasons, then
  it will be legitimate for the government to pursue their lottery winnings with
  higher property and pension taxes. Still, dear boomer, it was a good ride
  while it lasted. Phillip Inman is senior economics writer for the Guardian Do
