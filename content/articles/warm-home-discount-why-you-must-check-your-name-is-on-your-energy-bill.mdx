  The government is urging people who qualify for the warm home discount to
  check they are named on their energy bills so that this winter’s price cut can
  be made automatically. The annual scheme gives households on low incomes £150
  off their electricity bill, and is applied by the energy companies rather than
  sent out to customers. To qualify, you or your partner need to receive one of
  a list of benefits. These include housing benefit, income-based jobseeker’s
  allowance and pension credit. To get the discount, you also need your, or your
  partner’s, name to be on the bill. In England and Wales, the energy companies
  will automatically match people’s eligibility using their customer records
  from 24 August. In Scotland, the discount will automatically go to people who
  get pension credit guarantee and are named on their electricity bill. They
  will need to apply to their provider from October if on other qualifying
  benefits. It is not too late to get the discount after next Sunday, but you
  will need to wait for a letter to apply. Eligible customers on prepayment
  meters, who use a key or card to top up, should also ensure their household’s
  account is registered in their name. The government has expanded eligibility
  to the warm home discount this year, and it says that, as a result, 6 million
  households will receive the discount this winter – an increase of 2.7 million
  on last year. The minister for energy consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh, says: “If
  you know someone who might be eligible, please start spreading the word to
  family and friends, encouraging them to check they are named on their energy
  bill.” Richard Neudegg, the director of regulation at the price comparison
  website Uswitch, says the discount could be “a lifeline for vulnerable
  customers”. He adds: “Anyone struggling to pay their bills should contact
  their supplier, who may be able to offer help or support.” This year the
  government has also reversed the move that took the winter fuel payment from
  all but the poorest pensioners. As a result, about nine million pensioners
  will get the allowance of up to £300, which will be paid to everyone who
  receives the state pension. Those with an income of £35,000 or more will have
  theirs clawed back through tax. Scammers have been taking advantage of
  confusion over the payments to target vulnerable people. Fraudulent messages
  are sent to people saying they need to register for this year’s “winter
  heating allowance”, and asking them to follow a link and submit personal
  details. The Department for Work and Pensions says it never texts people to
  ask for their information. The energy price cap is likely to change at the
  start of October, with analysts recently predicting that it will fall from its
  current level of £1,720 a year for a typical household.
