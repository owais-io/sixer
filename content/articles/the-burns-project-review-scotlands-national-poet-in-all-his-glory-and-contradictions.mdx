  The Burns Project review – Scotland’s national poet in all his glory and
  contradictions
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-11T19:00:01Z'
bodyText: >-
  We are sitting around a table in the sedate surroundings of the Georgian
  House, the Robert Adam-designed townhouse run by the National Trust for
  Scotland. James Clements, playing the part of Robert Burns, says something
  about the weather, and suddenly a streak of lightning cuts down the length of
  the table top. It has a gash down the middle for that very purpose. It is a
  sign of the attention to detail in Cora Bissett’s excellent production. What
  could have been a by-the-numbers tribute to Scotland’s national poet is
  altogether more subtle, imaginative and contentious. The long, undulating
  table, designed by Jenny Booth and cleverly lit by Elle Taylor, continues to
  play an unexpected part: Clements appears from beneath a domed plate cover in
  a scene of hungover contrition, while a cutlery boat sets sail under its own
  steam towards the West Indies. Oh yes, the West Indies. One of the
  inconvenient truths about this people’s poet, the man who wrote the
  egalitarian A Man’s a Man for a’ That, is that it was only his newfound career
  as a published writer that stopped him heading to Jamaica to work in the slave
  trade. Clements’s script, drawing on private letters and recently digitised
  historical archival material, plus the voices of modern commentators, does not
  gloss over this, nor the poet’s womanising. Rather, it presents a rounded
  picture of a contradictory man who could write tender verse one minute and
  abandon a pregnant woman the next. Burns is embodied with gusto and rounded
  Ayrshire vowels by Clements, accompanied by Lisa Rigby, singing sweet
  renditions of favourites such as Ae Fond Kiss on guitar and shruti box. It
  works as both a primer to the short life of this farmer turned celebrity and a
  knotty study of his politics, compromises, artistic enthusiasms and colourful
  love life. • At the Georgian House, Edinburgh, until 16 August • All our
  Edinburgh festival reviews
