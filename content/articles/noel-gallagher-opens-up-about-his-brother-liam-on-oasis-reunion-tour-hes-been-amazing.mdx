  Noel Gallagher has opened up about his feelings towards his long-estranged
  brother Liam during Oasis’ sold-out global reunion tour for the first time,
  saying: “He’s been amazing … it’s great being back in the band with Liam.”
  Oasis announced they would be reuniting in August 2024, 15 years after their
  split in 2009 when Noel quit the band after a backstage brawl at the Rock en
  Seine festival in Paris, saying he “simply could not go on working with Liam a
  day longer”. The brothers continued to trade barbs for years and rejected any
  suggestion they would bury the hatchet, making their reunion a pleasant
  surprise for their fans. At their first show in Cardiff, the crowd responded
  with whistles and applause when the brothers briefly embraced at the end of
  the gig. Speaking to TalkSport’s Andy Goldstein and Darren Bent on Tuesday,
  Noel Gallagher said he had been “completely blown away” by the tour so far.
  “Liam’s smashing it. I’m proud of him,” he said. “I couldn’t do the stadium
  thing like he does it, it’s not in my nature. But I’ve got to say, I kind of
  look and I think, ‘Good for you mate.’ He’s been amazing. “It’s great just to
  be back with Bonehead [Paul Arthurs] and Liam and just be doing it again,” he
  continued. “I guess when it’s all said and done we will sit and reflect on it,
  but it’s great being back in the band with Liam, I forgot how funny he was.”
  Noel said he was taken aback by the fan response at their first show in
  Cardiff in July. “I can’t speak for anyone else, but for me personally, I
  grossly underestimated what I was getting into. It was kind of after about
  five minutes, I was like, all right, can I just go back to the dressing room
  and start this again?” he said. “I’ve done stadiums before and all that, but I
  don’t mind telling you, my legs had turned to jelly after about halfway
  through the second song. It’s been an amazing thing. Really is an amazing
  thing. It’s difficult to put into words, actually. “Every night is the crowd’s
  first night, you know what I mean? So every night’s got that kind of same
  energy to it, but it’s been truly amazing. I’m not usually short for words,
  but I can’t really articulate it.” Oasis have already played 17 dates across
  the UK and Ireland, and are continuing their away around the world with
  performances to come in the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and South America.
  The Oasis Live ‘25 tour is due to end in November in Brazil.
