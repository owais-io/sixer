  Aurora Orchestra/Collon review – high impact and high intensity as
  Shostakovich’s fifth is brought to life

  It’s 11 years since Aurora Orchestra first performed a symphony from memory at
  the BBC Proms. The irrepressibly energetic ensemble has been transfixing
  audiences with collective tightrope walks ever since. This year – 50 years
  since the composer’s death – Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony came in for the
  look-mum-no-music treatment. To be clear, the memorisation element is a red
  herring, not in itself guaranteeing a satisfying performance. That depends on
  interpretation and rehearsal technique. What memorising a piece on the scale
  of Shostakovich’s monumental Fifth does mean, however, is that every musician
  knows the work inside out, in all its 3D complexity – and every musician
  (whether a rank-and-file violin or a woodwind principal) is equally exposed.
  The result was a high-intensity, high-impact performance. The volume dropped
  from blistering climaxes to pianissimo whispers as if the musicians had
  hurtled off a cliff. The tone ranged from the rudely rustic (all biting
  strings and gritty dollops of brass) in the Scherzo to a single silken thread
  spun slowly into a finely shimmering fabric in the Largo. Conductor Nicholas
  Collon whipped tutti passages into a frenzy but left this orchestra of
  soloists to craft their own moments in the spotlight. The coordination was
  military-grade, the finale’s close a searing, passionate catharsis. The
  standing ovation felt inevitable. But it was also inflected by the preceding
  “musical and dramatical exploration”, a collaboration with Frantic Assembly.
  Actor/dancer Max Revell was a silent, knock-kneed Shostakovich, prone to
  physical collapse as his Soviet credentials were scrutinised by a three-person
  committee. Collon introduced the Fifth Symphony (cue live musical extracts) as
  Shostakovich’s response to recent condemnation from Stalin himself: first
  arguing for the composer’s political rehabilitation, then suggesting a
  counter-reading. Demonstrating in real time how musical meaning is flexible,
  always subjective, was virtuosic indeed and a final loosening of gravity’s
  grasp on the musicians themselves (upended by dancers as they played) was
  spectacular. But repressive regimes and artistic censorship are not historical
  curiosities – and sudden changes of state policy towards the arts are all too
  familiar. Poking fun at the committee’s arbitrary preferences and presenting
  Shostakovich as devoid of agency told its own disappointingly cosy story. • At
  Usher Hall, Edinburgh, on 18 August. Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12
  October. The Proms continue until 13 September.
