  Highgate cemetery has axed plans to build a controversial maintenance and
  toilet block as part of an £18m revamp of the graveyard, after grave owners
  warned they would exhume the remains of their loved ones if the building went
  ahead. Grave owners at the north London cemetery cautiously welcomed the
  removal of what they called a “bunker” from a planning application that
  sparked dozens of objections, including from Jeremy Corbyn, the actors
  Jonathan Pryce and Bertie Carvel, and the widows of the actor Tim Pigott-Smith
  and the sociologist Stuart Hall. But they remain suspicious of the management
  of the cemetery who had insisted during angry meetings that there was no
  alternative to building the gardeners’ block on a part of the graveyard known
  as the mound, where almost 200 people were recently buried. Grave owners fear
  that dropping the building from the application is just a “ploy” by the
  Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust (FHCT) to secure £18m of lottery funding
  for a scheme to redevelop the 36-acre (15-hectare) site. They fear that once
  the cash is secured the trust will resubmit plans for the contentious
  building. In a letter to grave owners sent on Monday, Ian Dungavell, the chief
  executive of FHCT, said the trust had “listened carefully to the views of
  grave owners” and “decided to remove the proposed gardeners’ building from our
  current application”. He added: “We hope the amended application will now move
  forward to determination, enabling the vital conservation work to begin.
  Importantly, consent for the amended application will also help us meet the
  timing requirements of the National Lottery Heritage Fund, whose support is
  critical to safeguarding the site’s nature and heritage for the community.” In
  response, one of the grave owners, Amir Sanei, an architect, wrote to
  Dungavell and the cemetery’s trustees asking them to rule out constructing the
  gardeners’ building on the mound and propose a new site for the facility. He
  wrote: “There is a valid concern among some mound grave owners that if you are
  not able to respond to these simple questions, that the omission of the
  gardeners’ building from this planning application (at this juncture) is
  merely a ploy … to secure funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund without the
  most controversial element of the proposals.” Mound grave owners are also
  considering urging the National Heritage Lottery Fund to make the award of any
  grant conditional on siting the new gardeners’ block on a different area of
  the site. Anna Seifert-Speck, a film producer and script editor, whose
  husband, Simon Speck, a sociologist, is buried on the mound, said: “There is
  still a deep suspicion that they are mainly doing it to secure the Heritage
  Lottery funding.” Seifert-Speck and Pigott-Smith’s widow, the actor Pamela
  Miles, have both previously threatened to exhume the remains of their husbands
  if the building went ahead. Seifert-Speck said: “We are considering an
  approach to Heritage Lottery to request making the award contingent on an
  alternative site for the gardeners’ building. The trust has had enough time to
  clarify where an essential building for the gardeners will go. We are
  concerned that the acceptance of an unchanged plan removes a lot of the
  alternative sites for the gardeners’ building and any room for manoeuvre.”
  Pigott-Smith’s son, Tom, a violinist, said: “I’m not sure I entirely trust it
  [the decision to remove the building from the plan] as we know they’re
  lobbying the planning committee right now about the application and why the
  alternative locations don’t work, but it’s a minor victory. They [the trust]
  have spent the last six months saying that they can’t possibly survive without
  it and snubbing the alternatives.” Dungevell’s letter explaining why the block
  had been removed from the plans said: “This decision gives us the opportunity
  to pause and review the needs and constraints that led to the original
  proposal for the gardeners’ building. Most importantly, it will allow us to
  work collaboratively with grave owners and the wider community to find the
  best way to provide essential gardeners’ facilities. “We hope this marks the
  beginning of a fresh conversation between the trust and grave owners, and we
  are committed to a new programme of consultation. Once we know the outcome of
  the amended application, we will begin this process and would welcome your
  ideas on how the dialogue should take shape and how best to stay in touch.”
