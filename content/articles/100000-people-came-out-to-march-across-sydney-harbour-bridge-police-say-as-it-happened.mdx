  We will wrap up today’s live blog here, on what has been an historic and busy
  news day. Here’s what we covered: The Sydney Harbour Bridge was closed at
  11.30am with police estimating at least 90,000 marched. Organisers claim up to
  300,000 pro-Palestinian supporters walked in the rain across the bridge from
  1.30pm after speeches from Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, Indigenous actor
  Meyne Wyatt and former Socceroo and Australian of the Year Craig Foster. Those
  in the protest included the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, former foreign
  affairs minister Bob Carr, and federal Labor MP Ed Husic. Shouts of “We are
  all Palestinian” could be heard from the front of the march. Text messages
  from NSW police told people to stop walking across the bridge, and police said
  they would work with protester organisers to get people off the bridge in a
  staged manner. The bridge emptied of people after 4pm, with protesters facing
  long delays on trains. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters in Melbourne
  were met by Victoria police in riot gear, trucks and a barricade as police
  blocked the plan for the protesters to block the Kings Street Bridge. In a
  media statement headlined “Time to move on”, the Victorian state opposition
  attacked the pro-Palestine protest in Melbourne, blaming the premier, Jacinta
  Allan, for failing to stop the blockade. Emergency services continue to search
  for a woman who police say escaped a vehicle stuck in flood waters in the
  Hunter region. There was a lot of rain and snow around parts of NSW. We will
  be back tomorrow with all the latest. Until then, stay safe. And that’s where
  we’ll wrap the blog up today. Thank you so much for staying with our live
  coverage of what was one of the biggest protests in Sydney’s history. The
  police estimate more than 90,000 people attended, with demonstrators
  stretching the entire length of the 1.2km Harbour Bridge. There will be more
  from us later this evening after our journalists that were on the ground file
  their coverage of the day. For now, find our latest here: Some more photos
  from the pro-Palestine protest that marched across Sydney Harbour Bridge
  today: Sydney Harbour Bridge protest ‘largest’ two senior police officers have
  seen Acting deputy commissioner Peter McKenna said the protest was the largest
  that he and the assistant police commissioner have seen in their time in the
  force in Sydney. McKenna pointed out during the press conference a short time
  ago that the Palestine Action Group’s form 1 to police estimated 10,000 people
  would march. Police now estimate there were 90,000. Asked if “the commotion
  around the event” caused it to be more popular than it would have otherwise
  been, McKenna said: All I know is that the supreme court allowed this to go
  ahead, and therefore we follow the law of the day, and we supported that.
  Victoria police release statement on thwarted Melbourne protest Thousands of
  Melburnians marched in solidarity with Sydney protesters today but were
  swiftly met with a firm police presence. Victoria police said about 3,000
  protesters had gathered at the State Library: The group marched from that
  location and despite repeated requests from police, they marched to King St.
  As a result of this, Victoria Police closed the King Street Bridge and
  diversions were put in place. Police established a line across King Street
  Bridge and protestors did not access the bridge. No arrests were made during
  the protest and the King Street Bridge has since been re-opened. Police added
  that they were making inquiries after someone was allegedly hit by an egg.
  Sydneysiders commended for avoiding non-essential travel Acting assistant
  commissioner Adam Johnson hands over to Craig Moran from Transport for NSW,
  who starts by thanking the people of Sydney who avoided non-essential travel.
  Moran also commends the decision to turn protesters around at the north end of
  the Sydney Harbour Bridge: Yes, there was quite a bit of congestion,
  particularly on the road network and the Anzac Bridge when the initial closure
  was put in place, we saw massive crowds that we had to work with police to
  manage. With those crowds that were on the Harbour Bridge, we equally had
  concerns about how we could safely accommodate those numbers, particularly at
  North Sydney station, and really supported the need to get them back towards
  the CBD, where we had more options to help get them home. Protesters were well
  behaved but day was ‘perilous’, police say Acting deputy commissioner Peter
  McKenna confirms that there were no reported injuries among civilians or
  police but describes the day as “perilous” at times: Gee whiz, I wouldn’t like
  to try and do this every Sunday at that short notice. There’s a reason we need
  time to plan these things out, and I think going forward into the future, that
  has to be taken into consideration. We’re very lucky today that the crowd was
  well behaved. McKenna hands over to acting assistant commissioner Adam
  Johnson, who echoes McKenna in saying he had never seen a more “perilous”
  situation: I can honestly say in my 35 years of policing, that was a perilous
  situation. I’ve never seen a more perilous situation. I was honestly worried
  that we were going to have a major incident with potential loss of life. NSW
  police are holding a press conference in Sydney after a march across Sydney
  Harbour Bridge was stopped due to safety concerns. The acting deputy
  commissioner Peter McKenna says police estimate 90,000 people took part in the
  protest: At points today we were really concerned about a crowd crush. He
  notes that the number was larger than the 50,000 that organisers estimated
  would turn out: We could not get those people, the number, the significant
  size of that crowd off that northern egress route without risking crowd crush.
  We could not allow those numbers to then egress into the northern side, into
  those train stations without again, that real risk of crowd crush. A view from
  a train shows the scale of the Sydney Harbour Bridge protest. From earlier,
  here’s a clip of pro-Palestine protesters chanting as they reached the
  northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge: ‘This is history in the making,’
  Sydney protester says It was striking how many children were in attendance at
  today’s march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with many carrying handmade
  signs and leading chants. Aaliyah, eight, sat on her father’s shoulders
  calling out “Free Palestine”, her face painted with the Palestinian flag. Her
  parents, Ali and Hanan, said it was “the injustice” that had brought them out
  today. Ali said: It’s 2025, how can we witness this. This is a big moment.
  This is history in the making. The people shut down the harbour bridge – the
  people did it. To Hanan, having her daughter there was special, representing
  something “bigger than us”: It’s very important to teach our children you
  stand up for what’s right. When something is unjust, you stand up for those
  who don’t have a voice. Protest plan to block Melbourne bridge blocked by
  Victoria police In Melbourne, pro-Palestine protesters marching for the 93rd
  time since 7 October 2023 were met by riot police at King Street Bridge. Their
  plan to block the bridge was stopped by police who were blocking the bridge.
  According to reports most of the protest crowd dispersed with a few dozen
  remaining on the bridge. A Victoria police spokesperson has said a statement
  will be issued at the end of the day. From earlier, here we can see from
  aerial shots the vast number of pro-Palestine protesters marching across the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge: Sydney Harbour Bridge now empty after protesters depart
  Trains are now running across the Sydney Harbour Bridge from the north to the
  south. The bridge is empty of protesters but police are standing in a line
  across the bridge near the south pylons. Some protesters continue to exit from
  the north end of the bridge after police asked the crowd to stop moving.
  Thousands turned around and marched south. Sydney pro-Palestine crowd could be
  as large as 300,000, organisers say Earlier today, the NSW police said the
  crowd crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge for the pro-Palestinian protest
  numbered was about 25,000, but the Palestine Action Group (PAG) had yesterday
  estimated it would be about 50,000. PAG now says police have said the crowd
  numbered about 100,000 people but, although the group has not yet analysed
  aerial photos to get an estimate, it says it could be as many as 300,000
  people. We will bring you more information on the crowd size if we get more
  word on it. The crowd was certainly large enough to force police to stop the
  march and have people leave the bridge in stages. People are now heading back
  to the city, but there have been delays on the trains, and the Metro isn’t
  running due to planned maintenence. Sydney pro-Palestinian protesters return
  home Thousands of very soggy protesters, this journalist included, are slowly
  making their way back to Sydney’s CBD after being directed by police to turn
  around while on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. There was a lot of confusion when
  NSW Police started texting people at about 3pm, with some people in the crowd
  uncertain whether to stay put and await further instructions or turn around as
  crowds were still moving to the northern end of the bridge. Helicopters
  continue to fly overhead, although amid the chants and traffic, it is
  difficult to hear the messages they are making via loudspeakers. But marchers’
  spirits remain high, and calls of “Free Palestine” are continuing. If you’re
  just joining us, here’s what we know so far about the pro-Palestinian marches
  in Sydney and Melbourne: The Sydney Harbour Bridge was closed at 11.30am with
  tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian supporters marching in the rain across
  the bridge from 1.30pm after speeches from Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi,
  Indigenous actor Meyne Wyatt and former Socceroo and Australian of the Year
  Craig Foster. Those in the protest included WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange,
  former foreign affairs minister, Bob Carr, and federal Labor MP Ed Husic.
  Shouts of “We are all Palestinian” could be heard from the front of the march.
  Text messages from NSW Police told people to stop walking across the bridge,
  and police say they will work with protester organisers to get people off the
  bridge in a staged manner. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters in Melbourne
  were met by Victoria police in riot gear, trucks and a barricade as police
  blocked the plan for the protesters to block the Kings Street Bridge. ‘A
  peaceful assembly and a powerful one,’ Labor MP Ed Husic says Ed Husic was
  among the many state and federal Labor MPs who marched at the head of the
  protest across the bridge. He told Guardian Australia moments after walking
  off the bridge that it was time for the government to sanction Israel and
  recognise Palestinian statehood: Where the Netanyahu government won’t listen
  to international concern about the treatment of innocent civilians, then
  sanctions are the appropriate way to respond. I genuinely believe that us
  standing with our friends in France, UK and Canada, is important. I just think
  it makes blazingly clear sense for us to work with really reliable, solid
  partners, as we’ve seen in the last week, [to] come out and call for
  recognition of Palestine. Asked if he thinks the march today shows that this
  is also what the country wants, he said: People power has come out, I think,
  largely because they just cannot abide the treatment that has been seen of
  little kids. They want the starvation to end. They want the killing to end.
  And that, I think, has propelled people on to the streets, rightly so, when
  the treatment of children that we’ve seen not only offends international
  humanitarian law, it offends our values as a people. This is been a peaceful
  assembly and a powerful one. NSW police want marchers to leave Sydney Harbour
  Bridge in ‘staged manner’ NSW police have issued a third geo-located text
  message to protesters on the Sydney Harbour Bridge advising that officers will
  be working with the protesters to get everyone off the bridge safely, but in a
  staged manner. They advised protesters to remain calm and follow directions by
  police. This is Graham Readfearn handing over to my colleague Josh Taylor to
  keep our live blog rolling. The day is a long way from over. Thanks for
  continuing to stay with us. Residents in parts of Gunnedah advised to evacuate
  as major flood level looms People living in two areas of the NSW town of
  Gunnedah have been advised to evacuate before 4pm as the Namoi River continues
  to rise after heavy rainfall. The NSW SES has issued emergency warnings for
  people in the Talibah Flats and Wolseley Park areas of the town, in north
  central NSW. The river is likely to reach a major flood level of 7.9 metres
  this evening and could rise to 8.2 metres by Monday morning, the warning from
  the SES says. There are 15 “Watch and Act” warnings in place across the state.
  Another text message is now asking people to stop walking north, while a
  helicopter flying above the bridge with a loudspeaker is asking the crowd to
  turn around and head back to the CBD. The text message says: Update from NSW
  Police: After consultation with protest organisers, we are asking that
  everyone stops walking north. As soon as the march has stopped, we will look
  at turning everyone around, back towards the city. BUT it needs to be done in
  a controlled way in stages to keep everyone safe. People in Sydney have
  received a text message from NSW police that says: Message from NSW Police: In
  consultation with the organisers, the march needs to stop due to public safety
  and await further instructions. Police have confirmed to the Guardian that the
  message is genuine. We’ll try to find out more about why the police have taken
  this step. Police start to turn Sydney protesters back across bridge One of
  our reporters at the Sydney march, Jordyn Beazley, says police are now trying
  to manoeuvre the front of the march back across the bridge. Police said a few
  moments ago that to avoid a potential crowd crush, they were allowing
  protesters to turn around and go back across the bridge. Melbourne protesters
  appear to be blocked from King Street Bridge While in Sydney the march across
  the Sydney Harbour Bridge has gone ahead, pro-Palestinian protesters in
  Melbourne’s CBD, who had planned to shut down King Street Bridge, appear to
  have been blocked from crossing the Bridge by police Video shared on social
  media by the protest organisers shows police in riot gear and shields blocking
  the King Street Bridge with trucks. Victoria police were approached to confirm
  the bridge had been shut down, and a spokesperson said a statement would be
  released at the end of the day. The front of the Sydney pro-Palestine march’
  has crossed the harbour bridge, with a video from the Guardian’s Shelley
  Hepworth on BlueSky showing the march at a standstill, with the crowd
  shouting, “We are all Palestinians.” Here are some more images of Julian
  Assange attending the Palestine Action Group’s March for Humanity protest in
  Sydney. Police say protesters can walk back across the bridge to avoid crowd
  crush NSW police have said protesters can now walk back across the Sydney
  Harbour Bridge once the march has reached the northern end, in an attempt to
  avoid a “potential crowd crush”. The initial plan was for protesters to walk
  north from the Wynyard end of the bridge, then disperse in North Sydney. But
  in a statement, police said “due to the public safety risk and prevailing
  weather conditions”, protesters could walk back southbound across the bridge
  to the Sydney CBD. Operation commander Adam Johnson said the change would be
  facilitated by specialist tactical police: People who travelled from Sydney’s
  northern suburbs can leave the group, and North Sydney train station will
  remain open and operating as originally intended, but due to the risk of a
  potential crowd crush scenario at the train station, we will now provide the
  third option of allowing protesters to walk back across the Bridge and
  disperse in the CBD. This means the Bridge will remain closed for a longer
  period than originally planned, until the operation concludes. I urge all
  involved to obey directions of police – they are acting in the best interests
  of everyone. Our planning and intent has always been to ensure the safety of
  everyone. We do not have an alternative. Crowd size estimate The Palestine
  Action Group who are organising the Sydney march were expecting about 50,000
  people to turn out. It’s difficult to say how many people are there right now,
  with reports and pictures of tightly packed streets. One police officer has
  told a Guardian reporter on the ground that the force thought the number was
  about 25,000. Protesters throng Wynyard station Protesters continue to arrive
  at Wynyard station in Sydney to walk across the Harbour Bridge – braving
  appalling weather conditions to protest Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in
  Gaza. ‘Innocent babies have no colour, no religion, no language’ The crowd has
  begun to slowly filter down Lang Street towards the bridge. Earlier, Nurses
  and Midwives 4 Palestine stood in the rain on with their umbrellas and large
  sign, swapping snacks and joining in chants. They have been braving all
  weather conditions to attend weekly pro-Palestine rallies since 2023. Today
  isn’t new for them – but what does feel different is the sheer scale of the
  march. Mark Murphy, a registered nurse and member of the group, says the
  Palestinian people have been “voiceless”: There’s a genocide, there’s forced
  starvation … Palestinians have got no rights. By us showing up here, it’s a
  small token … we want to make sure the rest of the world is hearing, and
  taking action. This is what people power’s all about. Philomena McGoldrick, a
  registered nurse and midwife, has spent stints working in Gaza and has been
  heartbroken by images circulating of starving children. She says: Innocent
  babies have no colour, no religion, no language. In this day and age … it’s
  heartbreaking … But it’s nice to meet people standing on the right side. The
  tide has changed. Crowd waits to march in Sydney during a break in the rain
  The rain has briefly abated and the crowd in Sydney, packed on Lang Street in
  their thousands, are waiting to march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Many
  protestors are carrying pots and utensils to draw attention to the ongoing
  starvation in Gaza. Dan, who is originally from the UK, is proudly holding a
  sign reading “Gay Jews 4 Gaza”. He’s in attendance over the frustration of the
  war in Gaza continuing for so long and the federal government “seemingly doing
  nothing”. I grew up in a north London Jewish community, and I think there’s a
  widespread Zionism that exists within the Jewish community that is difficult
  to separate from religion ... I think it’s important for people within the
  community to stand up and raise their voice against the state of Israel
  because they’re not representative of the Jewish community as a whole. Asked
  if this feels like a turning point, Dan says: I hope so ... it’s gone on long
  enough without action. We have word from our reporter, Jordyn Beazley, that
  protesters have now started to cross the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Among those at
  the front of the crowd are federal Labor MP Ed Husic, former NSW premier Bob
  Carr, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and five Labor MPs who defied calls
  from premier Chris Minns not to march. Hundreds of children and infants are in
  the crowd at Sydney’s Lang Park today, wearing ponchos and keffiyehs. Experts
  have warned that children, elderly people and those with pre-existing health
  conditions are most at risk of famine in Gaza, amid well-documented evidence
  of growing and worsening famine under conditions of Israeli restrictions on
  aid. Laura, a protester, has brought her baby Miro to the Sydney march. She’s
  attended pro-Palestinian rallies in the past but this is the first time she
  has brought her child with her. She tells Guardian Australia: How could you
  not be here today? It’s impossible not to be heartbroken by the pictures – why
  is it OK? It wouldn’t be OK if it was happening here. Maila, in year five, who
  has come with her parents and her brother Aki, has attended pro-Palestinian
  rallies since 2023. She says she imagines she will describe today’s
  thousands-strong crowd to her own children one day: I’m speaking out for the
  Palestinian kids like me, and for all of Palestine because of the war that’s
  been going on right now. It’s just really important … it feels really nice
  that other people stand beside me, and stand up for what I stand up to. This
  post and the caption below were amended on 3 August 2025 to correct the
  family’s names. Photographer Matthew Abbott is at the march in Sydney today
  taking images for Guardian Australia: Here’s an incredible scene sent to us of
  the George Street exit of Wynyard station in Sydney: Wet afternoon forecast
  for Sydney protesters Sydney pro-Palestine protesters look to be in for a wet
  and cold afternoon as they march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Bureau
  of Meteorology’s forecast suggests the temperature will “feel like” 12C for
  most of the afternoon with persistent showers. The bureau’s rain radar is
  suggesting the heavier falls may have passed but behind them is plenty of
  lighter rain for the next couple of hours, moving in off the coast. Greens
  senator Mehreen Faruqi is speaking at the protest now, taking a swipe at the
  NSW premier, Chris Minns, for not supporting the protest: Thank you for
  defying Chris Minns. This is a man who wants you to stay home and be silent in
  the face of a genocide. It was never about logistics. It was never about
  traffic. It was never about communications or anything else. It was always
  about stopping us and silencing us. It was always about protecting Israel and
  the Labor government from accountability. We’ve got to keep building this
  momentum because we don’t want rhetoric or words or signatures or gestures. We
  want the harshest sanctions on Israel. We are united and we are stronger and
  louder and more powerful together. Today we will make history. Thousands of
  Palestinian supporters arrive at Sydney’s Lang Park Thousands of people are
  arriving at Lang Park before today’s pro-Palestine march across the Sydney
  Harbour Bridge. Protesters are braving heavy rain and mud, carrying umbrellas
  and donning rain jackets, and many people are carrying signs and Palestinian
  flags. The Palestine Action Group estimated that tens of thousands of people
  would be taking part in the march, protesting against Israel’s conduct in Gaza
  and the reported starvation of children. “Watch and do nothing, what have you
  become?” one sign reads, while another says,“Ceasefire now.” Here’s the scene
  on one Sydney street as pro-Palestine marchers prepare to set off for the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge: Julian Assange and Bob Carr are at the Sydney
  Pro-Palestine march The Sydney Harbour Bridge was closed at 11.30am as
  pro-Palestine supporters gathered at Lang Park for the start of the march,
  which is expected to take three hours. March scheduled to start at 1.30pm from
  the corner of York and Grosvenor streets, then heading north-west on to the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge. Marchers will turn left on to Alfred Street and then go
  south to Bradfield Park. The Sydney march organiser is Palestine Action Group
  Sydney. There will be eight speakers, including Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi,
  Indigenous actor Meyne Wyatt and former Socceroo and Australian of the Year
  Craig Foster. Transport for NSW has asked people to avoid non-essential travel
  around the CBD and northern Sydney, warning there will be long delays. Bus
  services will be affected and travellers are being asked to check for updates.
  Pro-Palestinian protesters are also gathering in Melbourne ready to block the
  King Street Bridge this afternoon. In a media statement headlined “Time to
  move on” the Victorian state opposition has attacked the pro-Palestine protest
  in Melbourne, blaming premier Jacinta Allan for failing to stop the blockade.
  The demonstration would be “the 92nd pro-Palestine rally since 7 October
  2023”, the statement said, and the protests had become a “relentless
  campaign.” Opposition leader Brad Battin said: Every Victorian has the right
  to protest peacefully, but no one has the right to block bridges, shut down
  cities or stop our emergency services from attending emergencies. Premier
  Allan has let this go on for too long. Victorians are sick of the chaos. It’s
  time to stop talking and start acting. The statement said Victoria had
  abolished “move on” powers and was without a protest permit system. Shadow
  police minister David Southwick said: Victorians have had a gutful of serial
  protesters hijacking our city with no consequences. Labor is once again
  failing to protect our community, our economy, and our emergency services.
  Streets start to fill as Sydney pro-Palestine protesters gather The streets
  around Lang Park in Sydney are really starting to fill before the official 1pm
  start time of a pro-Palestine rally that will cross the now-closed Sydney
  Harbour Bridge later today. Protesters gather for a ‘Free Palestine’ march in
  Melbourne Pro-Palestine protesters in Melbourne are also beginning to gather
  for a march and blockade of the King Street Bridge in the city this afternoon.
  Search for woman swept away as emergency staff respond to more than 1,400
  calls My colleague Ben Smee has filed this story on the latest in the search
  for a 26-year-old woman who was swept away after a car she was travelling in
  got stuck in flood waters near Cessnock in the Hunter region. The Sydney
  Harbour Bridge was officially closed at 11.30am before this afternoon’s march
  in support of Palestinians. The bridge would usually be thrumming with
  traffic, but the Sydney Webcam shows a very wet, traffic-free zone. Green
  light for undersea power link between Tasmania and Victoria The Australian
  government has given the environmental green light to Marinus Link, the
  undersea electricity cable project between Tasmania and Victoria. The cable
  will send electricity in both directions between the two states, which the
  government says will help accelerate the transition to net zero. The approval
  comes just days after the Tasmanian government signed up to the $5bn project.
  Environment minister Murray Watt says the project will power homes and
  businesses, with the first stage of the Marinus Link to power 750,000 homes:
  It will also strengthen energy security for Tasmania and Victoria by providing
  National Electricity Market customers with greater access to a diverse and
  abundant supply of renewable energy and storage capacity. Project negotiations
  between the federal and state governments have taken several years, as cost
  estimates have increased. In 2021, it was estimated to cost $3bn. The
  Coalition’s position on climate change and net zero is a live issue on that
  side of politics, with policy reviews being run by the Nationals and the
  Liberals, and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce throwing a bomb into the debate with
  a private member’s bill calling for any policies that aim to reach net zero
  greenhouse gas emissions to be repealed. The shadow energy minister, Dan
  Tehan, told Sky this morning his party’s review of their climate and energy
  policy could take nine to 12 months to complete: As part of that policy, we’ve
  got to work out what will our nuclear policy be. What will our gas policy be?
  What will we do with state governments that continue to provide subsidies to
  keep coal-fired power stations going? What will your policy be when it comes
  to coal? These are all very complex matters, and we’ve already met as part of
  our working group, and we’ve said the first focus is going to be on gas. Tehan
  says the Liberals will also look at the party’s policy on gas and carbon
  capture and storage: They continue to go up year upon year upon year. That’s a
  fact, more fossil fuel was burned in 2024 than we’ve ever burnt in human
  history. Tehan was pressed on whether the Liberals would support the building
  of new coal-fired power stations, as proposed by some in the Coalition
  including Nationals senator Matt Canavan. Tehan didn’t give a straight answer,
  but he says the world needs “energy abundance” and state governments in NSW
  and Victoria are doing deals to extend the life of coal plants. Greens
  senator, journalists, activists and former Socceroo among Sydney march
  speakers There are eight official speakers for the pro-Palestine march in
  Sydney today, speaking at the Lang Park gathering point. Here’s the rundown,
  as announced by organisers Palestine Action Group. Meyne Wyatt, Indigenous
  actor Randa Abdel-Fattah, Palestinian writer and academic Craig Foster, former
  Australian of the Year and former Socceroo Mehreen Faruqi, Greens senator
  Antony Loewenstein, journalist Paul Keating, Maritime Union of Australia Tania
  Safi, activist Mohamed Duar, Amnesty International Reform negative gearing and
  capital gains tax, ACTU says ACTU secretary Sally McManus says negative
  gearing and capital gains tax should be changed, and she will bring a proposal
  to do that at a productivity roundtable this month. The ACTU will argue that
  the tax breaks for investors should be limited to one investment property.
  Changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax were once on the table for
  Labor, back in 2019 under Bill Shorten’s leadership. The Albanese government
  has continually ruled out reforms (despite a big push from the Greens in the
  last parliament). McManus tells ABC’s Insiders the tax settings should be
  “grandfathered” over five years: You can have as many investment properties as
  you want, but in terms of the tax benefit, limit that to one. Unless we change
  it, working people can’t live where they work. They can’t live where they grew
  up … A study in New South Wales said that there will be no grandchildren in
  Sydney because people between the ages of 30 and 40 can’t afford to live
  there. Protesters to blockade King Street Bridge in Melbourne Protesters in
  Melbourne are planning to blockade the King Street bridge from midday today in
  solidarity with NSW demonstrators. Event organisers Free Palestine Coalition
  Naarm urged supporters to “block the city for Gaza” and to bring pots and pans
  to “highlight the manufactured starvation that is causing mass casualties in
  Gaza”. In asocial media post, the group said: These shut downs are in
  preparation for international mass strikes, sanctions and blockades to end
  Israeli impunity. Victoria police on Friday said they had made “repeated
  requests” for protesters to change their plans, as blocking the bridge – which
  provides a major thoroughfare into the city – could delay emergency services.
  They said there would be a visible police presence in the city today “to keep
  the peace and ensure the safety of the community”. The premier, Jacinta Allan,
  on Saturday said she supported police efforts. From the state Labor
  conference, where several Palestine motions passed, she said: Anyone intending
  to disrupt emergency services or everyday Victorians going about their Sunday
  safely, anyone who then intends to disrupt that, will be dealt with swiftly.
  Organisers have said they would let emergency services vehicles through. As
  thousands of people make their way to Lang Park in central Sydney for the
  start of a march in support of Palestinians in Gaza, the organisers the
  Palestine Action Group have asked people to arrive early for the 1pm start.
  “Rain, hail, or shine, we will free Palestine!” the group said in a post on
  Facebook this morning. The weather forecast for the city is for rain. Be
  patient and look out for each other. Transport for NSW warned earlier today of
  extensive road and bus delays. The bridge will be closed from 11.30am. The
  action group said: We urge everyone to plan for a long day. Bring wet-weather
  gear, plenty of water and snacks. The Palestine movement is an anti-racist
  movement. We will not tolerate any form of racism or bigotry, including
  antisemitism or Islamophobia. Any flags or symbols which could be considered
  in breach of Australian legislation must not be brought or displayed. The
  group’s demands are to allow all aid into Gaza; for Israel to call an
  immediate ceasefire and withdraw from Gaza; to “sanction Israel now”; and for
  Australia to end any arms trade with Israel. There’s a lot of rain and snow
  around in NSW, with several rivers under a flood warning. NSW State Emergency
  Service has responded to more than 1,455 calls because of rain, thunderstorms
  and snow. The agency says “unprecedented snowfall” around Armidale and Guyra
  yesterday has created dangerous road conditions. Hunter, Peel and Namoi rivers
  are all under a major flood warning from the Bureau of Meteorology. There are
  minor flood warnings for the Macleay, Manning, Nepean, Paterson, Williams and
  Myall rivers. The rain and storms have come from a coastal low pressure system
  that senior bureau meteorologist Miriam Bradbury says is dragging moisture on
  to the land. Malarndirri McCarthy asks for peaceful protest on ‘significant
  day’ Federal politicians have been responding to the planned protest on the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge today, calling for the protesters to ensure the
  demonstrations are peaceful. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri
  McCarthy, told Sky News Agenda this morning that today will be a “significant
  day”: I would just encourage people to protest peacefully, look out for
  others. It is going to be a significant day down in Sydney today and with the
  court decision that came through yesterday … It is a right that we have in
  this country. Coalition frontbencher Dan Tehan also spoke to Sky this morning,
  and said protesting was a “right” in Australia. But he also questioned whether
  the protest would increase support for Gaza by the broader public: I think the
  right to protest, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, is something that’s
  fundamental to our nation … What the organisers of protest need to think about
  is, will their actions actually help their cause or not? I think blocking the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge for that extent of time might not do their cause the
  good that they’re seeking to do. ACTU repeats call for Australia to recognise
  Palestinian state The Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally
  McManus, says the government should “urgently” recognise a Palestinian state.
  McManus is on the ABC Insiders program this morning, and says the number of
  innocent people that have been killed is in the tens of thousands, and “now
  people are being starved”: We think that it is urgent that our government does
  recognise Palestine as a state, and you know, we need to do this urgently, and
  the reason is because people are starving. The ACTU has long supported a
  two-state solution, and has been calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza
  since conflict broke out after the 7 October attacks by Hamas. Transport for
  NSW says people in Sydney should expect major delays and disruptions on roads
  and public transport today because the Sydney Harbour Bridge will be closed
  for the pro-Palestine march. The bridge will be closed from 11.30am until
  about 4pm, the agency says, advising people to delay non-essential travel in
  the CBD and in North Sydney. Several roads in the city and to the north will
  be closed and long queues are expected to the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, extending
  to the western distributor, Anzac Bridge, Rozelle Interchange and the eastern
  distributor in the south, and Gore Hill Freeway and Lane Cove Tunnel “and all
  of the roads linking into these major corridors”. Bus services will stop at
  North Sydney or Wynyard while the bridge is closed and travellers should
  expect crowding on platforms. People can stay up to date with road issues on
  the agency’s sites for live traffic and transport alerts. Here’s our roundup
  of the travel disruptions from yesterday afternoon. Sydney MP Ed Husic to
  march with pro-Palestine protesters Western Sydney Labor MP Ed Husic believes
  it is the images of starving children in Gaza that has spurred many people to
  publicly support Palestinian people. Talking to the ABC, Husic says
  Australians are “deeply, deeply affected by the images they are seeing out of
  Gaza” of starving people. Husic, who the ABC reported would join the Sydney
  march, says protesters want to send “a strong message through peaceful
  protests to governments, both here and abroad, that the killing has got to
  stop”. Images of starving children is not only unacceptable, he says, it
  breaks international law and “offends our values as people, so I think you’re
  going to see today people turn out to send the message that they want to see
  this all end”: I want us today at this march to demonstrate to project our
  commitment to humanity and to the value of human life. It is very important.
  In doing so, we also need to recognise and work towards keeping our
  communities together. I feel really strongly that Jewish Australians or Muslim
  Australians cannot be held to account for the decisions of players or
  governments in other parts of the world. We have to recognise that. People
  should be able to practise their faith, go about their lives, their daily
  lives, without feeling fear. That’s really important. On the question of
  recognising a Palestinian state, Husic says it is right that Australia should
  join with others, including Canada, France and the UK: I think it’s right for
  our country to be able to join with friends, recognise Palestine now and for
  all the pre-conditions that we have set, have the best ability to do so by
  working early with big players on the international scene. ‘Incredibly
  chaotic’: Sussan Ley questions pro-Palestine Sydney protest The opposition
  leader, Sussan Ley, has questioned the pro-Palestine protest in Sydney due
  later today, saying it could have happened elsewhere without “massive
  diversion of police resources”. Talking to the ABC, Ley says everyone wants to
  “see the bloodshed stop” and says the war could end tomorrow with a Hamas
  surrender and the release of hostages. She says she remains “a friend of the
  Palestinian people” and says Palestinians in Gaza need to be fed, but she has
  questioned the need to close the Harbour Bridge: We are seeing protests now
  regular – this is going to happen on an ongoing basis – it is going to create
  massive diversion of police resources. What are they not going to be able to
  do because they are dealing with this? The language of the people running this
  protest doesn’t sound peaceful to me and protests, of course, can happen in
  Australia. I respect the right of free speech and protest, but this is taking
  it to another level – shutting down a major access route, the Sydney Harbour
  Bridge. The protest could happen elsewhere, and I also know of law
  enforcement, quite concerned about what they will have to do in response to
  this. This is obviously, with respect to something that has happened overseas
  and I’ve just described how I believe Australians feel about that, but we
  don’t need to shut down something as important as the Harbour Bridge and there
  is work being done on the Metro as well, so this is going to be incredibly
  chaotic for Sydneysiders today. We need peace first. Everyone wants to see
  this war end. Emergency services are searching for a woman who police were
  told had escaped from a vehicle that was stuck in flood waters in the Hunter
  region. Officers were called at about 7.50pm yesterday to Black Creek, 16km
  north of Cessnock. The driver and passenger of a Mini Countryman had been seen
  getting out of the car. The driver escaped uninjured but the passenger,
  thought to be in her 20s, was swept away. After NSW SES arrived, a 40-year-old
  man was also rescued after becoming stuck in a tree and then being pushed out
  and through the waters. The NSW police force says hundreds of officers will be
  checking for “unlawful and antisocial behaviour” at Sydney’s pro-Palestine
  march today. Adam Johnson, the central metropolitan region commander, and
  acting assistant commissioner, said community safety was the focus: The first
  and upmost priority for NSW police is always the safety of those protesting,
  other members of the public who may be impacted by the protest, and the
  officers involved in the operation. Police will have a high-visibility
  presence at the operation today and will work with participants to ensure
  there are no breaches of the peace. We ask all those who will be participating
  in the protest to please follow police directions and respect those around
  you. We also encourage other members of the public to avoid the area if
  possible. Hundreds of officers were briefed from 8am today before the closure
  of the bridge, expected from 11.30am. The march itself is due to start at 1pm,
  with protesters gathering at Lang Park near Wynyard. Good morning. Graham
  Readfearn here, bringing your live news coverage for Sunday, with a lot going
  on. Later this morning tens of thousands of people are expected to begin
  gathering at Lang Park in Sydney for a march across the Harbour Bridge in
  support of Palestine. Protesters are also planning to blockade the King Street
  Bridge in Melbourne at lunchtime. There’s also wild weather across NSW with
  the State Emergency Service responding to more than 1,400 calls due to severe
  rainfall, thunderstorms and snow. We’ll have a lot more detail on all this and
  more through the day. Stay safe and if you are heading out in NSW, check the
  weather and go prepared.

We will wrap up today’s live blog here, on what has been an historic and busy news day. Here’s what we covered: The Sydney Harbour Bridge was closed at 11.30am with police estimating at least 90,000 marched. Organisers claim up to 300,000 pro-Palestinian supporters walked in the rain across the bridge from 1.30pm after speeches from Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, Indigenous actor Meyne Wyatt and former Socceroo and Australian of the Year Craig Foster. Those in the protest included the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, former foreign affairs minister Bob Carr, and federal Labor MP Ed Husic. Shouts of “We are all Palestinian” could be heard from the front of the march. Text messages from NSW police told people to stop walking across the bridge, and police said they would work with protester organisers to get people off the bridge in a staged manner. The bridge emptied of people after 4pm, with protesters facing long delays on trains. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters in Melbourne were met by Victoria police in riot gear, trucks and a barricade as police blocked the plan for the protesters to block the Kings Street Bridge. In a media statement headlined “Time to move on”, the Victorian state opposition attacked the pro-Palestine protest in Melbourne, blaming the premier, Jacinta Allan, for failing to stop the blockade. Emergency services continue to search for a woman who police say escaped a vehicle stuck in flood waters in the Hunter region. There was a lot of rain and snow around parts of NSW. We will be back tomorrow with all the latest. Until then, stay safe. And that’s where we’ll wrap the blog up today. Thank you so much for staying with our live coverage of what was one of the biggest protests in Sydney’s history. The police estimate more than 90,000 people attended, with demonstrators stretching the entire length of the 1.2km Harbour Bridge. There will be more from us later this evening after our journalists that were on the ground file their coverage of the day. For now, find our latest here: Some more photos from the pro-Palestine protest that marched across Sydney Harbour Bridge today: Sydney Harbour Bridge protest ‘largest’ two senior police officers have seen Acting deputy commissioner Peter McKenna said the protest was the largest that he and the assistant police commissioner have seen in their time in the force in Sydney. McKenna pointed out during the press conference a short time ago that the Palestine Action Group’s form 1 to police estimated 10,000 people would march. Police now estimate there were 90,000. Asked if “the commotion around the event” caused it to be more popular than it would have otherwise been, McKenna said: All I know is that the supreme court allowed this to go ahead, and therefore we follow the law of the day, and we supported that. Victoria police release statement on thwarted Melbourne protest Thousands of Melburnians marched in solidarity with Sydney protesters today but were swiftly met with a firm police presence. Victoria police said about 3,000 protesters had gathered at the State Library: The group marched from that location and despite repeated requests from police, they marched to King St. As a result of this, Victoria Police closed the King Street Bridge and diversions were put in place. Police established a line across King Street Bridge and protestors did not access the bridge. No arrests were made during the protest and the King Street Bridge has since been re-opened. Police added that they were making inquiries after someone was allegedly hit by an egg. Sydneysiders commended for avoiding non-essential travel Acting assistant commissioner Adam Johnson hands over to Craig Moran from Transport for NSW, who starts by thanking the people of Sydney who avoided non-essential travel. Moran also commends the decision to turn protesters around at the north end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge: Yes, there was quite a bit of congestion, particularly on the road network and the Anzac Bridge when the initial closure was put in place, we saw massive crowds that we had to work with police to manage. With those crowds that were on the Harbour Bridge, we equally had concerns about how we could safely accommodate those numbers, particularly at North Sydney station, and really supported the need to get them back towards the CBD, where we had more options to help get them home. Protesters were well behaved but day was ‘perilous’, police say Acting deputy commissioner Peter McKenna confirms that there were no reported injuries among civilians or police but describes the day as “perilous” at times: Gee whiz, I wouldn’t like to try and do this every Sunday at that short notice. There’s a reason we need time to plan these things out, and I think going forward into the future, that has to be taken into consideration. We’re very lucky today that the crowd was well behaved. McKenna hands over to acting assistant commissioner Adam Johnson, who echoes McKenna in saying he had never seen a more “perilous” situation: I can honestly say in my 35 years of policing, that was a perilous situation. I’ve never seen a more perilous situation. I was honestly worried that we were going to have a major incident with potential loss of life. NSW police are holding a press conference in Sydney after a march across Sydney Harbour Bridge was stopped due to safety concerns. The acting deputy commissioner Peter McKenna says police estimate 90,000 people took part in the protest: At points today we were really concerned about a crowd crush. He notes that the number was larger than the 50,000 that organisers estimated would turn out: We could not get those people, the number, the significant size of that crowd off that northern egress route without risking crowd crush. We could not allow those numbers to then egress into the northern side, into those train stations without again, that real risk of crowd crush. A view from a train shows the scale of the Sydney Harbour Bridge protest. From earlier, here’s a clip of pro-Palestine protesters chanting as they reached the northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge: ‘This is history in the making,’ Sydney protester says It was striking how many children were in attendance at today’s march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, with many carrying handmade signs and leading chants. Aaliyah, eight, sat on her father’s shoulders calling out “Free Palestine”, her face painted with the Palestinian flag. Her parents, Ali and Hanan, said it was “the injustice” that had brought them out today. Ali said: It’s 2025, how can we witness this. This is a big moment. This is history in the making. The people shut down the harbour bridge – the people did it. To Hanan, having her daughter there was special, representing something “bigger than us”: It’s very important to teach our children you stand up for what’s right. When something is unjust, you stand up for those who don’t have a voice. Protest plan to block Melbourne bridge blocked by Victoria police In Melbourne, pro-Palestine protesters marching for the 93rd time since 7 October 2023 were met by riot police at King Street Bridge. Their plan to block the bridge was stopped by police who were blocking the bridge. According to reports most of the protest crowd dispersed with a few dozen remaining on the bridge. A Victoria police spokesperson has said a statement will be issued at the end of the day. From earlier, here we can see from aerial shots the vast number of pro-Palestine protesters marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge: Sydney Harbour Bridge now empty after protesters depart Trains are now running across the Sydney Harbour Bridge from the north to the south. The bridge is empty of protesters but police are standing in a line across the bridge near the south pylons. Some protesters continue to exit from the north end of the bridge after police asked the crowd to stop moving. Thousands turned around and marched south. Sydney pro-Palestine crowd could be as large as 300,000, organisers say Earlier today, the NSW police said the crowd crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge for the pro-Palestinian protest numbered was about 25,000, but the Palestine Action Group (PAG) had yesterday estimated it would be about 50,000. PAG now says police have said the crowd numbered about 100,000 people but, although the group has not yet analysed aerial photos to get an estimate, it says it could be as many as 300,000 people. We will bring you more information on the crowd size if we get more word on it. The crowd was certainly large enough to force police to stop the march and have people leave the bridge in stages. People are now heading back to the city, but there have been delays on the trains, and the Metro isn’t running due to planned maintenence. Sydney pro-Palestinian protesters return home Thousands of very soggy protesters, this journalist included, are slowly making their way back to Sydney’s CBD after being directed by police to turn around while on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. There was a lot of confusion when NSW Police started texting people at about 3pm, with some people in the crowd uncertain whether to stay put and await further instructions or turn around as crowds were still moving to the northern end of the bridge. Helicopters continue to fly overhead, although amid the chants and traffic, it is difficult to hear the messages they are making via loudspeakers. But marchers’ spirits remain high, and calls of “Free Palestine” are continuing. If you’re just joining us, here’s what we know so far about the pro-Palestinian marches in Sydney and Melbourne: The Sydney Harbour Bridge was closed at 11.30am with tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian supporters marching in the rain across the bridge from 1.30pm after speeches from Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, Indigenous actor Meyne Wyatt and former Socceroo and Australian of the Year Craig Foster. Those in the protest included WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, former foreign affairs minister, Bob Carr, and federal Labor MP Ed Husic. Shouts of “We are all Palestinian” could be heard from the front of the march. Text messages from NSW Police told people to stop walking across the bridge, and police say they will work with protester organisers to get people off the bridge in a staged manner. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters in Melbourne were met by Victoria police in riot gear, trucks and a barricade as police blocked the plan for the protesters to block the Kings Street Bridge. ‘A peaceful assembly and a powerful one,’ Labor MP Ed Husic says Ed Husic was among the many state and federal Labor MPs who marched at the head of the protest across the bridge. He told Guardian Australia moments after walking off the bridge that it was time for the government to sanction Israel and recognise Palestinian statehood: Where the Netanyahu government won’t listen to international concern about the treatment of innocent civilians, then sanctions are the appropriate way to respond. I genuinely believe that us standing with our friends in France, UK and Canada, is important. I just think it makes blazingly clear sense for us to work with really reliable, solid partners, as we’ve seen in the last week, [to] come out and call for recognition of Palestine. Asked if he thinks the march today shows that this is also what the country wants, he said: People power has come out, I think, largely because they just cannot abide the treatment that has been seen of little kids. They want the starvation to end. They want the killing to end. And that, I think, has propelled people on to the streets, rightly so, when the treatment of children that we’ve seen not only offends international humanitarian law, it offends our values as a people. This is been a peaceful assembly and a powerful one. NSW police want marchers to leave Sydney Harbour Bridge in ‘staged manner’ NSW police have issued a third geo-located text message to protesters on the Sydney Harbour Bridge advising that officers will be working with the protesters to get everyone off the bridge safely, but in a staged manner. They advised protesters to remain calm and follow directions by police. This is Graham Readfearn handing over to my colleague Josh Taylor to keep our live blog rolling. The day is a long way from over. Thanks for continuing to stay with us. Residents in parts of Gunnedah advised to evacuate as major flood level looms People living in two areas of the NSW town of Gunnedah have been advised to evacuate before 4pm as the Namoi River continues to rise after heavy rainfall. The NSW SES has issued emergency warnings for people in the Talibah Flats and Wolseley Park areas of the town, in north central NSW. The river is likely to reach a major flood level of 7.9 metres this evening and could rise to 8.2 metres by Monday morning, the warning from the SES says. There are 15 “Watch and Act” warnings in place across the state. Another text message is now asking people to stop walking north, while a helicopter flying above the bridge with a loudspeaker is asking the crowd to turn around and head back to the CBD. The text message says: Update from NSW Police: After consultation with protest organisers, we are asking that everyone stops walking north. As soon as the march has stopped, we will look at turning everyone around, back towards the city. BUT it needs to be done in a controlled way in stages to keep everyone safe. People in Sydney have received a text message from NSW police that says: Message from NSW Police: In consultation with the organisers, the march needs to stop due to public safety and await further instructions. Police have confirmed to the Guardian that the message is genuine. We’ll try to find out more about why the police have taken this step. Police start to turn Sydney protesters back across bridge One of our reporters at the Sydney march, Jordyn Beazley, says police are now trying to manoeuvre the front of the march back across the bridge. Police said a few moments ago that to avoid a potential crowd crush, they were allowing protesters to turn around and go back across the bridge. Melbourne protesters appear to be blocked from King Street Bridge While in Sydney the march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge has gone ahead, pro-Palestinian protesters in Melbourne’s CBD, who had planned to shut down King Street Bridge, appear to have been blocked from crossing the Bridge by police Video shared on social media by the protest organisers shows police in riot gear and shields blocking the King Street Bridge with trucks. Victoria police were approached to confirm the bridge had been shut down, and a spokesperson said a statement would be released at the end of the day. The front of the Sydney pro-Palestine march’ has crossed the harbour bridge, with a video from the Guardian’s Shelley Hepworth on BlueSky showing the march at a standstill, with the crowd shouting, “We are all Palestinians.” Here are some more images of Julian Assange attending the Palestine Action Group’s March for Humanity protest in Sydney. Police say protesters can walk back across the bridge to avoid crowd crush NSW police have said protesters can now walk back across the Sydney Harbour Bridge once the march has reached the northern end, in an attempt to avoid a “potential crowd crush”. The initial plan was for protesters to walk north from the Wynyard end of the bridge, then disperse in North Sydney. But in a statement, police said “due to the public safety risk and prevailing weather conditions”, protesters could walk back southbound across the bridge to the Sydney CBD. Operation commander Adam Johnson said the change would be facilitated by specialist tactical police: People who travelled from Sydney’s northern suburbs can leave the group, and North Sydney train station will remain open and operating as originally intended, but due to the risk of a potential crowd crush scenario at the train station, we will now provide the third option of allowing protesters to walk back across the Bridge and disperse in the CBD. This means the Bridge will remain closed for a longer period than originally planned, until the operation concludes. I urge all involved to obey directions of police – they are acting in the best interests of everyone. Our planning and intent has always been to ensure the safety of everyone. We do not have an alternative. Crowd size estimate The Palestine Action Group who are organising the Sydney march were expecting about 50,000 people to turn out. It’s difficult to say how many people are there right now, with reports and pictures of tightly packed streets. One police officer has told a Guardian reporter on the ground that the force thought the number was about 25,000. Protesters throng Wynyard station Protesters continue to arrive at Wynyard station in Sydney to walk across the Harbour Bridge – braving appalling weather conditions to protest Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in Gaza. ‘Innocent babies have no colour, no religion, no language’ The crowd has begun to slowly filter down Lang Street towards the bridge. Earlier, Nurses and Midwives 4 Palestine stood in the rain on with their umbrellas and large sign, swapping snacks and joining in chants. They have been braving all weather conditions to attend weekly pro-Palestine rallies since 2023. Today isn’t new for them – but what does feel different is the sheer scale of the march. Mark Murphy, a registered nurse and member of the group, says the Palestinian people have been “voiceless”: There’s a genocide, there’s forced starvation … Palestinians have got no rights. By us showing up here, it’s a small token … we want to make sure the rest of the world is hearing, and taking action. This is what people power’s all about. Philomena McGoldrick, a registered nurse and midwife, has spent stints working in Gaza and has been heartbroken by images circulating of starving children. She says: Innocent babies have no colour, no religion, no language. In this day and age … it’s heartbreaking … But it’s nice to meet people standing on the right side. The tide has changed. Crowd waits to march in Sydney during a break in the rain The rain has briefly abated and the crowd in Sydney, packed on Lang Street in their thousands, are waiting to march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Many protestors are carrying pots and utensils to draw attention to the ongoing starvation in Gaza. Dan, who is originally from the UK, is proudly holding a sign reading “Gay Jews 4 Gaza”. He’s in attendance over the frustration of the war in Gaza continuing for so long and the federal government “seemingly doing nothing”. I grew up in a north London Jewish community, and I think there’s a widespread Zionism that exists within the Jewish community that is difficult to separate from religion ... I think it’s important for people within the community to stand up and raise their voice against the state of Israel because they’re not representative of the Jewish community as a whole. Asked if this feels like a turning point, Dan says: I hope so ... it’s gone on long enough without action. We have word from our reporter, Jordyn Beazley, that protesters have now started to cross the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Among those at the front of the crowd are federal Labor MP Ed Husic, former NSW premier Bob Carr, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and five Labor MPs who defied calls from premier Chris Minns not to march. Hundreds of children and infants are in the crowd at Sydney’s Lang Park today, wearing ponchos and keffiyehs. Experts have warned that children, elderly people and those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk of famine in Gaza, amid well-documented evidence of growing and worsening famine under conditions of Israeli restrictions on aid. Laura, a protester, has brought her baby Miro to the Sydney march. She’s attended pro-Palestinian rallies in the past but this is the first time she has brought her child with her. She tells Guardian Australia: How could you not be here today? It’s impossible not to be heartbroken by the pictures – why is it OK? It wouldn’t be OK if it was happening here. Maila, in year five, who has come with her parents and her brother Aki, has attended pro-Palestinian rallies since 2023. She says she imagines she will describe today’s thousands-strong crowd to her own children one day: I’m speaking out for the Palestinian kids like me, and for all of Palestine because of the war that’s been going on right now. It’s just really important … it feels really nice that other people stand beside me, and stand up for what I stand up to. This post and the caption below were amended on 3 August 2025 to correct the family’s names. Photographer Matthew Abbott is at the march in Sydney today taking images for Guardian Australia: Here’s an incredible scene sent to us of the George Street exit of Wynyard station in Sydney: Wet afternoon forecast for Sydney protesters Sydney pro-Palestine protesters look to be in for a wet and cold afternoon as they march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Bureau of Meteorology’s forecast suggests the temperature will “feel like” 12C for most of the afternoon with persistent showers. The bureau’s rain radar is suggesting the heavier falls may have passed but behind them is plenty of lighter rain for the next couple of hours, moving in off the coast. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi is speaking at the protest now, taking a swipe at the NSW premier, Chris Minns, for not supporting the protest: Thank you for defying Chris Minns. This is a man who wants you to stay home and be silent in the face of a genocide. It was never about logistics. It was never about traffic. It was never about communications or anything else. It was always about stopping us and silencing us. It was always about protecting Israel and the Labor government from accountability. We’ve got to keep building this momentum because we don’t want rhetoric or words or signatures or gestures. We want the harshest sanctions on Israel. We are united and we are stronger and louder and more powerful together. Today we will make history. Thousands of Palestinian supporters arrive at Sydney’s Lang Park Thousands of people are arriving at Lang Park before today’s pro-Palestine march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Protesters are braving heavy rain and mud, carrying umbrellas and donning rain jackets, and many people are carrying signs and Palestinian flags. The Palestine Action Group estimated that tens of thousands of people would be taking part in the march, protesting against Israel’s conduct in Gaza and the reported starvation of children. “Watch and do nothing, what have you become?” one sign reads, while another says,“Ceasefire now.” Here’s the scene on one Sydney street as pro-Palestine marchers prepare to set off for the Sydney Harbour Bridge: Julian Assange and Bob Carr are at the Sydney Pro-Palestine march The Sydney Harbour Bridge was closed at 11.30am as pro-Palestine supporters gathered at Lang Park for the start of the march, which is expected to take three hours. March scheduled to start at 1.30pm from the corner of York and Grosvenor streets, then heading north-west on to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Marchers will turn left on to Alfred Street and then go south to Bradfield Park. The Sydney march organiser is Palestine Action Group Sydney. There will be eight speakers, including Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, Indigenous actor Meyne Wyatt and former Socceroo and Australian of the Year Craig Foster. Transport for NSW has asked people to avoid non-essential travel around the CBD and northern Sydney, warning there will be long delays. Bus services will be affected and travellers are being asked to check for updates. Pro-Palestinian protesters are also gathering in Melbourne ready to block the King Street Bridge this afternoon. In a media statement headlined “Time to move on” the Victorian state opposition has attacked the pro-Palestine protest in Melbourne, blaming premier Jacinta Allan for failing to stop the blockade. The demonstration would be “the 92nd pro-Palestine rally since 7 October 2023”, the statement said, and the protests had become a “relentless campaign.” Opposition leader Brad Battin said: Every Victorian has the right to protest peacefully, but no one has the right to block bridges, shut down cities or stop our emergency services from attending emergencies. Premier Allan has let this go on for too long. Victorians are sick of the chaos. It’s time to stop talking and start acting. The statement said Victoria had abolished “move on” powers and was without a protest permit system. Shadow police minister David Southwick said: Victorians have had a gutful of serial protesters hijacking our city with no consequences. Labor is once again failing to protect our community, our economy, and our emergency services. Streets start to fill as Sydney pro-Palestine protesters gather The streets around Lang Park in Sydney are really starting to fill before the official 1pm start time of a pro-Palestine rally that will cross the now-closed Sydney Harbour Bridge later today. Protesters gather for a ‘Free Palestine’ march in Melbourne Pro-Palestine protesters in Melbourne are also beginning to gather for a march and blockade of the King Street Bridge in the city this afternoon. Search for woman swept away as emergency staff respond to more than 1,400 calls My colleague Ben Smee has filed this story on the latest in the search for a 26-year-old woman who was swept away after a car she was travelling in got stuck in flood waters near Cessnock in the Hunter region. The Sydney Harbour Bridge was officially closed at 11.30am before this afternoon’s march in support of Palestinians. The bridge would usually be thrumming with traffic, but the Sydney Webcam shows a very wet, traffic-free zone. Green light for undersea power link between Tasmania and Victoria The Australian government has given the environmental green light to Marinus Link, the undersea electricity cable project between Tasmania and Victoria. The cable will send electricity in both directions between the two states, which the government says will help accelerate the transition to net zero. The approval comes just days after the Tasmanian government signed up to the $5bn project. Environment minister Murray Watt says the project will power homes and businesses, with the first stage of the Marinus Link to power 750,000 homes: It will also strengthen energy security for Tasmania and Victoria by providing National Electricity Market customers with greater access to a diverse and abundant supply of renewable energy and storage capacity. Project negotiations between the federal and state governments have taken several years, as cost estimates have increased. In 2021, it was estimated to cost $3bn. The Coalition’s position on climate change and net zero is a live issue on that side of politics, with policy reviews being run by the Nationals and the Liberals, and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce throwing a bomb into the debate with a private member’s bill calling for any policies that aim to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions to be repealed. The shadow energy minister, Dan Tehan, told Sky this morning his party’s review of their climate and energy policy could take nine to 12 months to complete: As part of that policy, we’ve got to work out what will our nuclear policy be. What will our gas policy be? What will we do with state governments that continue to provide subsidies to keep coal-fired power stations going? What will your policy be when it comes to coal? These are all very complex matters, and we’ve already met as part of our working group, and we’ve said the first focus is going to be on gas. Tehan says the Liberals will also look at the party’s policy on gas and carbon capture and storage: They continue to go up year upon year upon year. That’s a fact, more fossil fuel was burned in 2024 than we’ve ever burnt in human history. Tehan was pressed on whether the Liberals would support the building of new coal-fired power stations, as proposed by some in the Coalition including Nationals senator Matt Canavan. Tehan didn’t give a straight answer, but he says the world needs “energy abundance” and state governments in NSW and Victoria are doing deals to extend the life of coal plants. Greens senator, journalists, activists and former Socceroo among Sydney march speakers There are eight official speakers for the pro-Palestine march in Sydney today, speaking at the Lang Park gathering point. Here’s the rundown, as announced by organisers Palestine Action Group. Meyne Wyatt, Indigenous actor Randa Abdel-Fattah, Palestinian writer and academic Craig Foster, former Australian of the Year and former Socceroo Mehreen Faruqi, Greens senator Antony Loewenstein, journalist Paul Keating, Maritime Union of Australia Tania Safi, activist Mohamed Duar, Amnesty International Reform negative gearing and capital gains tax, ACTU says ACTU secretary Sally McManus says negative gearing and capital gains tax should be changed, and she will bring a proposal to do that at a productivity roundtable this month. The ACTU will argue that the tax breaks for investors should be limited to one investment property. Changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax were once on the table for Labor, back in 2019 under Bill Shorten’s leadership. The Albanese government has continually ruled out reforms (despite a big push from the Greens in the last parliament). McManus tells ABC’s Insiders the tax settings should be “grandfathered” over five years: You can have as many investment properties as you want, but in terms of the tax benefit, limit that to one. Unless we change it, working people can’t live where they work. They can’t live where they grew up … A study in New South Wales said that there will be no grandchildren in Sydney because people between the ages of 30 and 40 can’t afford to live there. Protesters to blockade King Street Bridge in Melbourne Protesters in Melbourne are planning to blockade the King Street bridge from midday today in solidarity with NSW demonstrators. Event organisers Free Palestine Coalition Naarm urged supporters to “block the city for Gaza” and to bring pots and pans to “highlight the manufactured starvation that is causing mass casualties in Gaza”. In asocial media post, the group said: These shut downs are in preparation for international mass strikes, sanctions and blockades to end Israeli impunity. Victoria police on Friday said they had made “repeated requests” for protesters to change their plans, as blocking the bridge – which provides a major thoroughfare into the city – could delay emergency services. They said there would be a visible police presence in the city today “to keep the peace and ensure the safety of the community”. The premier, Jacinta Allan, on Saturday said she supported police efforts. From the state Labor conference, where several Palestine motions passed, she said: Anyone intending to disrupt emergency services or everyday Victorians going about their Sunday safely, anyone who then intends to disrupt that, will be dealt with swiftly. Organisers have said they would let emergency services vehicles through. As thousands of people make their way to Lang Park in central Sydney for the start of a march in support of Palestinians in Gaza, the organisers the Palestine Action Group have asked people to arrive early for the 1pm start. “Rain, hail, or shine, we will free Palestine!” the group said in a post on Facebook this morning. The weather forecast for the city is for rain. Be patient and look out for each other. Transport for NSW warned earlier today of extensive road and bus delays. The bridge will be closed from 11.30am. The action group said: We urge everyone to plan for a long day. Bring wet-weather gear, plenty of water and snacks. The Palestine movement is an anti-racist movement. We will not tolerate any form of racism or bigotry, including antisemitism or Islamophobia. Any flags or symbols which could be considered in breach of Australian legislation must not be brought or displayed. The group’s demands are to allow all aid into Gaza; for Israel to call an immediate ceasefire and withdraw from Gaza; to “sanction Israel now”; and for Australia to end any arms trade with Israel. There’s a lot of rain and snow around in NSW, with several rivers under a flood warning. NSW State Emergency Service has responded to more than 1,455 calls because of rain, thunderstorms and snow. The agency says “unprecedented snowfall” around Armidale and Guyra yesterday has created dangerous road conditions. Hunter, Peel and Namoi rivers are all under a major flood warning from the Bureau of Meteorology. There are minor flood warnings for the Macleay, Manning, Nepean, Paterson, Williams and Myall rivers. The rain and storms have come from a coastal low pressure system that senior bureau meteorologist Miriam Bradbury says is dragging moisture on to the land. Malarndirri McCarthy asks for peaceful protest on ‘significant day’ Federal politicians have been responding to the planned protest on the Sydney Harbour Bridge today, calling for the protesters to ensure the demonstrations are peaceful. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, told Sky News Agenda this morning that today will be a “significant day”: I would just encourage people to protest peacefully, look out for others. It is going to be a significant day down in Sydney today and with the court decision that came through yesterday … It is a right that we have in this country. Coalition frontbencher Dan Tehan also spoke to Sky this morning, and said protesting was a “right” in Australia. But he also questioned whether the protest would increase support for Gaza by the broader public: I think the right to protest, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, is something that’s fundamental to our nation … What the organisers of protest need to think about is, will their actions actually help their cause or not? I think blocking the Sydney Harbour Bridge for that extent of time might not do their cause the good that they’re seeking to do. ACTU repeats call for Australia to recognise Palestinian state The Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, says the government should “urgently” recognise a Palestinian state. McManus is on the ABC Insiders program this morning, and says the number of innocent people that have been killed is in the tens of thousands, and “now people are being starved”: We think that it is urgent that our government does recognise Palestine as a state, and you know, we need to do this urgently, and the reason is because people are starving. The ACTU has long supported a two-state solution, and has been calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza since conflict broke out after the 7 October attacks by Hamas. Transport for NSW says people in Sydney should expect major delays and disruptions on roads and public transport today because the Sydney Harbour Bridge will be closed for the pro-Palestine march. The bridge will be closed from 11.30am until about 4pm, the agency says, advising people to delay non-essential travel in the CBD and in North Sydney. Several roads in the city and to the north will be closed and long queues are expected to the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, extending to the western distributor, Anzac Bridge, Rozelle Interchange and the eastern distributor in the south, and Gore Hill Freeway and Lane Cove Tunnel “and all of the roads linking into these major corridors”. Bus services will stop at North Sydney or Wynyard while the bridge is closed and travellers should expect crowding on platforms. People can stay up to date with road issues on the agency’s sites for live traffic and transport alerts. Here’s our roundup of the travel disruptions from yesterday afternoon. Sydney MP Ed Husic to march with pro-Palestine protesters Western Sydney Labor MP Ed Husic believes it is the images of starving children in Gaza that has spurred many people to publicly support Palestinian people. Talking to the ABC, Husic says Australians are “deeply, deeply affected by the images they are seeing out of Gaza” of starving people. Husic, who the ABC reported would join the Sydney march, says protesters want to send “a strong message through peaceful protests to governments, both here and abroad, that the killing has got to stop”. Images of starving children is not only unacceptable, he says, it breaks international law and “offends our values as people, so I think you’re going to see today people turn out to send the message that they want to see this all end”: I want us today at this march to demonstrate to project our commitment to humanity and to the value of human life. It is very important. In doing so, we also need to recognise and work towards keeping our communities together. I feel really strongly that Jewish Australians or Muslim Australians cannot be held to account for the decisions of players or governments in other parts of the world. We have to recognise that. People should be able to practise their faith, go about their lives, their daily lives, without feeling fear. That’s really important. On the question of recognising a Palestinian state, Husic says it is right that Australia should join with others, including Canada, France and the UK: I think it’s right for our country to be able to join with friends, recognise Palestine now and for all the pre-conditions that we have set, have the best ability to do so by working early with big players on the international scene. ‘Incredibly chaotic’: Sussan Ley questions pro-Palestine Sydney protest The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has questioned the pro-Palestine protest in Sydney due later today, saying it could have happened elsewhere without “massive diversion of police resources”. Talking to the ABC, Ley says everyone wants to “see the bloodshed stop” and says the war could end tomorrow with a Hamas surrender and the release of hostages. She says she remains “a friend of the Palestinian people” and says Palestinians in Gaza need to be fed, but she has questioned the need to close the Harbour Bridge: We are seeing protests now regular – this is going to happen on an ongoing basis – it is going to create massive diversion of police resources. What are they not going to be able to do because they are dealing with this? The language of the people running this protest doesn’t sound peaceful to me and protests, of course, can happen in Australia. I respect the right of free speech and protest, but this is taking it to another level – shutting down a major access route, the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The protest could happen elsewhere, and I also know of law enforcement, quite concerned about what they will have to do in response to this. This is obviously, with respect to something that has happened overseas and I’ve just described how I believe Australians feel about that, but we don’t need to shut down something as important as the Harbour Bridge and there is work being done on the Metro as well, so this is going to be incredibly chaotic for Sydneysiders today. We need peace first. Everyone wants to see this war end. Emergency services are searching for a woman who police were told had escaped from a vehicle that was stuck in flood waters in the Hunter region. Officers were called at about 7.50pm yesterday to Black Creek, 16km north of Cessnock. The driver and passenger of a Mini Countryman had been seen getting out of the car. The driver escaped uninjured but the passenger, thought to be in her 20s, was swept away. After NSW SES arrived, a 40-year-old man was also rescued after becoming stuck in a tree and then being pushed out and through the waters. The NSW police force says hundreds of officers will be checking for “unlawful and antisocial behaviour” at Sydney’s pro-Palestine march today. Adam Johnson, the central metropolitan region commander, and acting assistant commissioner, said community safety was the focus: The first and upmost priority for NSW police is always the safety of those protesting, other members of the public who may be impacted by the protest, and the officers involved in the operation. Police will have a high-visibility presence at the operation today and will work with participants to ensure there are no breaches of the peace. We ask all those who will be participating in the protest to please follow police directions and respect those around you. We also encourage other members of the public to avoid the area if possible. Hundreds of officers were briefed from 8am today before the closure of the bridge, expected from 11.30am. The march itself is due to start at 1pm, with protesters gathering at Lang Park near Wynyard. Good morning. Graham Readfearn here, bringing your live news coverage for Sunday, with a lot going on. Later this morning tens of thousands of people are expected to begin gathering at Lang Park in Sydney for a march across the Harbour Bridge in support of Palestine. Protesters are also planning to blockade the King Street Bridge in Melbourne at lunchtime. There’s also wild weather across NSW with the State Emergency Service responding to more than 1,400 calls due to severe rainfall, thunderstorms and snow. We’ll have a lot more detail on all this and more through the day. Stay safe and if you are heading out in NSW, check the weather and go prepared.
