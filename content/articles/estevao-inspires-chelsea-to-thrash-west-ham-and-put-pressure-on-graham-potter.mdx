  This was Graham Potter finding out what a broken club really looks like. It is
  the London Stadium emptying out long before full time, patience worn thin by
  the latest in a long line of humiliations. It is one young fan mounting a solo
  pitch invasion after being driven to despair by his side’s inability to defend
  set pieces. It is a new £15m goalkeeper who cannot catch crosses and, as much
  as Potter will plead for calm, it is that the only positive for West Ham was
  Chelsea pretty much declaring after going 5-1 up with over half an hour to
  play. Chelsea had run through at will, cutting West Ham’s execrable back five
  to shreds, João Pedro and Estêvão Willian playing a different sport from every
  individual in claret and blue. Whatever the gulf in class, though, there can
  be no excuse for a performance so lacking in heart and a team so incapable of
  doing the basics. There is no hiding place for Potter, who has taken fewer
  points from his first 10 home games in the Premier League than any manager in
  West Ham’s history. He is already under pressure, already facing suggestions
  that he is in trouble after eight months in the job, although there is the
  awkward question of whether he is more symptom than cause. After all, the
  sense that Potter is the wrong fit at a club who tend to feed off emotion
  should not overlook the fact that this collapse owes much to years of West
  Ham’s owners making one bad decision after another on and off the pitch. Put
  it all together and Potter could be forgiven if he was pining for the days
  when he was struggling to make sense of life at Chelsea. He was bruised by his
  experience in west London, although the longer time has gone on the more it
  has become apparent that Chelsea were simply going through a period of
  transition. Their owners have built a seriously talented squad since firing
  Potter. Cole Palmer pulling out of this game with a groin injury just before
  kick off? It hardly mattered when manager Enzo Maresca was simply able to
  bring in Estêvão and watch the 18-year-old Brazilian prodigy rip West Ham
  apart with his speed and skill on just his first competitive start for
  Chelsea. It bordered on the absurd that Chelsea had fallen behind to a
  stunning early goal from Lucas Paquetá. The theory that fatigue will be one of
  the biggest challenges for Maresca’s side after their Club World Cup exertions
  had been given strength by Palmer exiting the warm-up early. It meant a rejig
  in an attack led by Liam Delap – Estêvão came in on the right, João Pedro
  played as the No 10 and Pedro Neto moved to the left – and the late
  alterations initially had West Ham thinking that their luck was about to turn
  after losing to Sunderland on the opening weekend. Yet the optimism faded soon
  after Estêvão lost possession in the sixth minute and watched Paquetá send a
  swerving shot past Robert Sánchez from 25 yards. Chelsea needed less than 10
  minutes to respond in the manner of world champions, Neto’s corner headed on
  by Marc Cucurella for João Pedro to shake off Aaron Wan-Bissaka and equalise.
  They were soon ahead, Paquetá squandering possession before João Pedro crossed
  for Neto to convert, and the game had run away from Potter’s side by the time
  Estêvão sliced through West Ham’s left side before crossing for Enzo Fernández
  to make it 3-1 in the 34th minute. It became painful for Potter, who has won
  two home games since replacing Julen Lopetegui in January. West Ham, who have
  conceded eight in their first two games, are relegation candidates. Midfield
  reinforcements cannot come quickly enough. Moisés Caicedo and Fernández ran
  over James Ward-Prowse and Tomas Soucek. Max Kilman, Jean-Clair Todibo and
  Nayef Aguerd all looked like expensive mistakes in central defence. West Ham
  crumbled. They have no leadership. Estêvão’s assist for Fernández was followed
  by the camera cutting to David Sullivan, West Ham’s largest shareholder. The
  mood in the stands was a curious mix of anger and apathy. Many have lost
  patience with Sullivan after an uninspired transfer window, blaming him for
  the club’s shoddy recruitment. There were more boos when the 33-year-old
  Callum Wilson replaced the 32-year-old Niclas Füllkrug up front. It got worse.
  Mads Hermansen flapped at a corner and gifted a fourth goal to Caicedo. West
  Ham cannot defend their box. The next corner brought more confusion, Hermansen
  bullied before Trevoh Chalobah scored the fifth. It turned ugly. Fans near the
  dugout aimed furious gestures at Potter and one young supporter ran on the
  pitch. Attempts to tackle the boy were complicated by an older fan breaking
  through security and confronting stewards , capping off a night off utter
  embarrassment for West Ham.
