  A funeral director has been banned from working with hospitals in Leeds after
  a mother said she was left screaming when she found her dead baby propped up
  “watching” cartoons at the woman’s home. Amie Upton has been banned from NHS
  maternity wards and mortuaries in the city after keeping babies’ bodies at her
  house in circumstances that a grandmother of another baby compared to a horror
  film. Upton, 38, told the BBC she had only ever had two complaints while
  running a baby loss support and funeral service, Florrie’s Army, named after
  her own baby who was stillborn in 2017. When contacted by the Guardian, Upton
  said she did not want to comment. Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust said it
  barred Upton from its mortuaries and maternity wards in spring this year. A
  Facebook page for Florrie’s Army said it offered a baby funeral service as
  well as providing clothing, handprints and photographs. Zoe Ward contacted
  Upton after her baby boy Bleu died of brain damage at three weeks old in 2021,
  and said she thought the service sounded “brilliant”. She told the BBC as part
  of an investigation into Florrie’s Army that she had expected Bleu to be
  looked after in a professional setting, including in a refrigerated cot.
  However, when she visited Bleu at Upton’s home she said she was terrified to
  find her son’s body in the living room “watching” cartoons in a baby bouncer.
  “I realised it were Bleu and she [Upton] says: ‘Come in, we’re watching PJ
  Masks.’ There’s a cat scratcher in the corner and I can hear a dog barking and
  there was another [dead] baby on the sofa. It wasn’t a nice sight. “I rang my
  mum and I’m saying: ‘This ain’t right’ … I was screaming down the phone
  [saying]: ‘It’s mucky, it’s dirty, he can’t stay here.’” She said she was left
  upset and angry by the “weird” experience. “I didn’t want him in that house,”
  she said. Another couple were led to believe their baby was being kept at a
  funeral home in Headingley until she could be buried but more than a week
  later were told their daughter was at Upton’s home 5 miles away. The woman
  told the BBC she believed her child’s body had not been kept at the correct
  temperature, saying it was “really smelly, like she’d been in there and not
  kept cool”. The BBC reported seeing evidence that babies’ bodies were not
  being kept in a refrigerated cot, though Upton did have one. The woman’s
  mother said: “It was just crazy. If I told somebody of this story … they’d
  think it was a horror film.” The hospitals trust said it had been notified of
  “several serious concerns” over the past few years, which had been raised with
  the police, external safeguarding services, relevant regulators and the
  coroner’s office. The trust said it had been monitoring Upton’s attendance at
  Leeds’s two major hospitals, St James’s and Leeds General Infirmary, since
  2021 and had since banned Upton from its maternity wards and mortuaries.
  Rabina Tindale, the chief nurse at the trust, said: “Some families have
  believed services are linked to or supported by the trust. We must be clear
  that neither Amie Upton or Florrie’s Army is endorsed by, or associated with,
  Leeds teaching hospitals. “Since 2021 we have had specific safeguarding
  measures in place, including monitoring Amie’s attendance when visiting
  deceased patients at the mortuary in her funeral service role. Any visitors to
  the mortuary are always accompanied by mortuary staff. Any handover of a body
  is undertaken in line with trust policies and procedures and takes place to an
  authorised funeral director.” In England and Wales, there are no regulations
  governing funeral homes, including how bodies should be handled or stored. Two
  professional associations, the National Association of Funeral Directors and
  the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors, have a joint
  code of conduct, which includes standards for inspections, but membership is
  not compulsory.
