  Manchester United are closing in on the signing of the Royal Antwerp
  goalkeeper Senne Lammens for about €20m (£17m), with the 23-year-old expected
  to compete with André Onana. Onana’s place at United has been under scrutiny
  following a string of unconvincing displays after his arrival from Inter for
  £44.4m in July 2023. The Cameroon international was left out of the squad for
  the opening-day loss to Arsenal last weekend only to see his replacement,
  Altay Bayindir, make an error that directly led to Riccardo Calafiori’s
  winning goal. Onana expects to remain at United beyond the current transfer
  window having been made aware that the club have rebuffed inquiries from other
  clubs for his services but he is now poised to face further pressure for his
  place from Lammens. The 6ft 3in Belgium Under-21s international made his
  senior debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years
  later, making a first appearance for the club that November in a 2-0 Champions
  League defeat by Porto. Sources in Belgium suggest United have agreed terms
  with the player but it is understood that is not yet the case. Onana is likely
  to miss part of the season because of his involvement in Cameroon’s Africa Cup
  of Nations campaign in Morocco. Their opening match is against Gabon on
  Christmas Eve. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim says it is “not a good thing” to have
  four first-team players training away from the squad and not being considered
  for selection. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia, and
  have been working separately since the start of pre-season as they seek moves
  away from Old Trafford. None of the four were included in the squad for
  United’s pre-season tour, nor did they feature in the opening-day defeat to
  Arsenal. They will also not be part of the squad that travels to Fulham on
  Sunday. United will ideally seal exits, permanent or temporary, for the
  quartet before the transfer window closes on 1 September. But if they do not
  leave, Amorim is open to reintegrating them into his squad. “I know that is
  not a good thing to have players in this situation but it’s clear they want to
  play in a different club,” Amorim said. “We try to arrange everything for both
  parties to be happy, so I have to try to imagine to have the training with the
  guys that I think are going to be the future and the other guys are training
  and preparing for the next chapter. When the window is closed it’s a different
  history,we have to receive the players and in a new life.” Garnacho has
  attracted interest from Chelsea; Sancho has held talks with Roma; Antony could
  potentially return to Real Betis where he spent the second half of last season
  on loan; and Malacia is a target for Celtic, Besiktas and Porto. United are
  yet to sell a player for a fee this summer. Of the senior players under
  contract, only Marcus Rashford has departed. The England forward joined
  Barcelona on a season-long loan, with the Catalan club covering his wages.
  Benjamin Sesko is likely to start in attack at Craven Cottage after coming off
  the bench for his debut against Arsenal last Sunday. Speaking about the
  situation in goal, Amorim said: “Onana is ready to play like last week, so we
  will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper”
