  Hull KR underlined their position as Super League’s new dominant force with a
  statement victory at the home of the reigning champions and took a giant step
  towards completing the second leg of a historic treble. Having won the
  Challenge Cup earlier this summer, the Robins are now close to clinching a
  first ever League Leaders’ Shield after the kind of performance that confirms
  they are very much the team to beat on the road to the Grand Final at Old
  Trafford this October. Willie Peters’ side are now six points clear of the
  Warriors at the top of the table with five rounds remaining, with Wigan now
  seemingly in a battle to remain in the top two before the playoffs beginning
  next month. The Warriors were way below their best here, but the Robins were
  magnificent from start to finish. Dean Hadley’s first-half try coupled with
  three goals from the boot of Rhyse Martin proved to be enough to secure
  victory thanks to a stunning defensive rearguard that was only breached four
  minutes from time when Adam Keighran touched down. That set up a grandstand
  finale, but the Robins held firm in the final few minutes. It felt like a
  major psychological blow ahead of the playoffs. “The job’s not done,” Peters
  said. “We’ve got a tough and challenging run-in but the boys worked extremely
  hard for each other here. They’ll enjoy the win and they’ll enjoy the journey
  home.” Hadley’s try midway through the first half was the least Rovers
  deserved for their dominance with and without the ball. Martin converted that
  try and then added a penalty on the stroke of half-time to open up a two-score
  lead that, in truth, Wigan never looked like overturning all evening. “I
  thought the best team won,” Wigan’s coach, Matt Peet, said. “If we’d managed
  to nick anything at the end it would have been against the run of play.” His
  team will have to improve come the playoffs if they are to defend their title
  but there is no doubt they have the ability to do so. They fell 10-0 behind in
  the second half when Martin added another penalty as Wigan continued to
  struggle. For large stretches, it looked as though the Warriors would be kept
  scoreless at home but they at least avoided that when Keighran finished a
  smart move with four minutes to go after a Robins handling error. However,
  Hull KR rode out some late pressure to all but guarantee their spot at the top
  of the table come the playoffs. Wigan Field; Miski, Eckersley, Wardle,
  Marshall; Keighran, Smith; Havard, O’Neill, Byrne, Walters, Farrell, Ellis.
  Interchange Mago, Leeming, Dupree, Hill. Try Keighran. Goal Keighran. Sin bin
  Farrell. Hull KR Broadbent; Davies, Hiku, Batchelor, Burgess; Mourgue, Lewis;
  Sue, Litten, Whitbread, Hadley, Martin, Minchella. Interchange
  Waerea-Hargreaves, Luckley, Tanginoa, Leyland. Try Hadley. Goals Martin (3).
  Referee Liam Moore.
