  Mr Bigstuff 9pm, Sky Max What’s the best way to follow up the discovery of a
  major marital betrayal? A slap-up meal at the carvery! That’s where Glen
  (series creator Ryan Sampson), Kirsty (Harriet Webb) and Lee (Danny Dyer) find
  themselves in the first episode of this double bill, followed by a revelatory
  season finale for the unlikely Bafta-winning sitcom. Ellen E Jones Saving
  Lives at Sea 8pm, BBC Two The hard work of lifeboat crews continues to be
  celebrated in this series, as a 10-year-old boy is stranded at sea on his
  paddleboard in North Berwick, East Lothian. Elsewhere, off the east Kent
  coast, a yacht with three people on board has got stuck at Goodwin Sands,
  which is known as “the ship swallower”. Hollie Richardson Tom Kerridge Cooks
  Spain 8.30pm, ITV1 In Andalucía, the chef meets a “wine chemist” who explains
  the sherry vinegar process. Does Kerridge have the patience to make his own?
  Then, in Cádiz, the chef learns about the area’s burgeoning avocado business
  and gets to work in helping to grow them.HR The Gone 9pm, BBC Two This New
  Zealand/Ireland-set crime drama moves slowly at times – Aileen and Derry’s
  wander through the woods in this episode may try your patience somewhat – but
  it’s still darkly intriguing. When search-and-rescue teams locate the pair,
  they think a breakthrough is near. But before long, they have another homicide
  on their hands. Phil Harrison The Secret Life of Trees 9pm, Channel 5 It’s the
  last episode of the Michael Palin-narrated nature series, and he’s poignantly
  exploring death and renewal. Not only can decaying trees start new life,
  astonishingly they can “walk” and plant new roots, too. HR FBI 9pm, Sky
  Witness Here’s a seventh season of a straight procedural co-created by Dick
  Wolf of Law &amp; Order fame. That means pacy storytelling with minimal flair,
  though the stakes feel big in the new run’s opener, as a car bomb on a New
  York bridge sends the FBI on a trail that leads to an assassination plot with
  Iranian involvement – and a departure from the cast. Jack Seale
