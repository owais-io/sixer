  It’s nearly 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s the latest: The Palestinian
  health ministry in Gaza said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in
  Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. It said victims remained under rubble
  and in the streets, with crews unable to reach them. The Wafa news agency
  reported that at least nine civilians were killed in separate Israeli strikes
  across Gaza on Saturday. At least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while
  attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, the ministry said, bringing
  the total number of what it describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed and
  more than 15,308 injured since the war began. Eight people, including two
  children, died of starvation in Gaza hospitals in the past day, according to
  health officials. That brings the total number of recorded deaths from hunger
  to 281, of whom 114 were children. Strikes also targeted tents sheltering
  displaced people in Khan Younis, home to hundreds of thousands who had fled
  elsewhere in Gaza. More than half the victims were women and children, the AP
  reported. In northern Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at least five people
  waiting for aid near the Zikim crossing, where UN and other agencies’ convoys
  enter the strip, health officials at Sheikh Radwan field hospital told AP.
  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, urged more
  medical evacuations, warning that 15,600 patients, including 3,800 children,
  need specialised care. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, said famine in Gaza
  is worsening “by the hour” and urged Israel to let aid in at scale. UNRWA said
  it has warehouses full of food, medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan and
  Egypt but has been blocked from bringing them into Gaza. In the occupied West
  Bank, Israeli forces continued a large-scale assault on the village of
  al-Mughayyir near Ramallah. Marzouq Abu Naim, deputy head of the village
  council, told Wafa that troops had stormed more than 30 homes, destroyed
  property, and smashed or seized dozens of vehicles. Médecins Sans Frontières
  (MSF) said its clinics around Gaza City are treating large numbers of people
  as bombardments force further displacement. “Strikes are forcing people,
  including MSF staff, to flee their homes once again, and we are seeing
  displacement across Gaza City,” the group said. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas
  Araghchi, said he spoke by phone with his French, German and British
  counterparts to prevent a vote on UN sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear
  programme, ahead of a European deadline. A senior health official in Gaza has
  warned of severe overcrowding in a children’s malnutrition clinic as famine in
  the enclave reaches what he described as a “critical phase”. Ahmed al-Farra,
  director of the Tahrir hospital for children and maternity at the Nasser
  medical complex in Khan Younis, appeared in a video released by the health
  ministry showing crowded scenes inside the clinic. In a translation carried by
  Anadolu news agency, al-Farra said the clinic, which operates only two days a
  week, is now receiving “three to four times” the expected number of patients.
  “Each day the clinic is open, no fewer than 52 new cases are diagnosed,” he
  said. Al-Farra highlighted the case of 18-month-old Shahd Mohammed Zaarab, who
  weighs just 5.8kg compared to the normal 11–12kg for her age. He said the
  child was suffering from acute malnutrition, having lost both fat and muscle
  mass. “Her condition is like a skeleton covered with skin,” he said. Earlier
  we reported that eight people died of starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours,
  according to the Palestinian health ministry. The commander-in-chief of Iran’s
  Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has warned that Israel would face a
  “more crushing response” if it carried out further attacks against the
  country, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). Major
  General Mohammad Pakpour made the comments on Saturday during a meeting with
  Ahmadreza Pourkhaghan, head of the judiciary organisation of the armed forces.
  Referring to the IRGC’s combat readiness, Pakpour said: If the Zionist regime
  repeats its aggression against the country, it will receive a more
  regret-inducing and crushing response than the 12-day war in June. He added
  that ensuring the safety and security of IRGC personnel would remain a
  priority “as in the past”. Arif Husain, chief economist at the UN’s World Food
  Programme (WFP), has explained what qualifies as a famine after the UN-backed
  Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) formally declared one in
  parts of Gaza. In a video posted to X, Husain said: Famine is a technical
  term. We say there is a famine when three conditions come together in a
  specific geographic area. First, at least 20 percent of the population, in
  that particular place must be facing extreme levels of hunger. Second, 30
  percent of the children in the same place must be wasted, they are too tall
  for their weight, so they’re very skinny basically. And the third condition is
  that the mortality rate must double from the average of, for adults, one
  person per 10,000 per day, to two people per 10,000 per day. When these three
  conditions come together, we say it’s a famine. On Friday, the IPC said an
  estimated 514,000 people in Gaza – about a quarter of the enclave’s population
  – are experiencing famine, a figure expected to rise to 641,000 by the end of
  September. Israel has denied that a famine is taking place, while the United
  States appeared to dismiss the findings as part of what it called a “false
  narrative of deliberate mass starvation” promoted by Hamas. Earlier today, we
  reported that eight people had starved to death in Gaza in the past 24 hours,
  according to the Palestinian health ministry. Gaza’s civil defence service,
  made up of local emergency crews, say they carried out 39 missions in the past
  24 hours as Israeli strikes hit tents sheltering displaced people in the
  enclave. Crews reported operations in the Beach Camp in the north, and in
  Rafah to the south, where tents for displaced people were struck by Israeli
  forces. Patients were taken from attacks near schools, mosques and hospitals,
  including al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat and tents in the Asdaa area of Rafah,
  where ten people were rushed to treatment. Civil defence also reported
  transporting victims from strikes in Khan Younis and Gaza City, including
  fires in the Rimal neighbourhood. One of the dead was transported from al-Awda
  hospital in Nuseirat, others were injured by gunfire, the civil defence said.
  The service said the scale of operations underlined the pressure on emergency
  crews who continue to recover the wounded, and the dead, from across Gaza.
  With ground troops already active in strategic areas, the widescale operation
  in Gaza City could start within days, reports the Associated Press (AP). Aid
  group Doctors without Borders, or Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said on
  Saturday its clinics around Gaza City are seeing high numbers of patients as
  people flee recent bombardments. The group said in a statement that “strikes
  are forcing people, including MSF staff, to flee their homes once again, and
  we are seeing displacement across Gaza City″. According to the AP, the Israeli
  military has said troops are operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in
  the city’s Zeitoun neighbourhood. Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in
  the southern Gaza Strip early on Saturday, according to morgue records and
  health officials at Nasser hospital, reports the Associated Press (AP). The
  officials said the strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan
  Younis, which became home to hundreds of thousands who had fled from elsewhere
  in Gaza. More than half of the dead were women and children, reported the AP.
  Awad Abu Agala, uncle of two children who died, told the AP no place in Gaza
  is now safe. “The entire Gaza Strip is being bombed … In the south. In the
  north. Everywhere,” Abu Agala said, explaining that the children were targeted
  overnight while in their tents. In northern Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at
  least five aid-seekers on Saturday near the Zikim crossing with Israel, where
  UN and other agencies’ convoys enter the territory, health officials at the
  Sheikh Radwan field hospital told the AP. Six people were killed in other
  attacks on Gaza elsewhere Saturday, according to hospitals and the Palestinian
  Red Crescent. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions
  from the AP about the deaths. It is 2.49pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is
  a summary of today’s blog so far: The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza
  has said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks
  over the past 24 hours. The ministry said a number of victims remained under
  rubble and on the streets, with ambulance and civil defence crews unable to
  reach them. The Wafa news agency reported that at least nine Palestinian
  civilians had been killed in a series of Israeli attacks across Gaza on
  Saturday. The ministry reported that at least 16 people were killed and 111
  injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, bringing the
  total number of what the ministry describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed,
  and more than 15,308 injured since the war began. Hospitals in Gaza also
  recorded eight new deaths due to starvation and malnutrition, including two
  children, bringing the total to 281 deaths from hunger, of whom 114 were
  children. Israel has dismantled the proven and internationally backed civilian
  model of aid distribution in Gaza, according to a joint report from Forensic
  Architecture (FA) and the World Peace Foundation (WPF), which said the move
  has furthered both Israel’s military objectives and starvation in the
  territory. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for an
  urgent scale-up of evacuations from Gaza, warning that more than 15,600
  patients remain in need of specialised care, including 3,800 children. In a
  post on X, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the UAE for
  supporting the latest evacuation of critically injured and sick patients but
  stressed that far more action is needed. The head of the UN agency for
  Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, has called on Israel to
  allow aid into Gaza at scale, saying famine in the territory is worsening by
  the hour. He also shared comments from undersecretary general for humanitarian
  affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who said the famine
  confirmed by the IPC report should be read “in sorrow and in anger”. Unrwa
  says it has warehouses full of food, medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan
  and Egypt but is being blocked from bringing them into Gaza. “While famine is
  confirmed in Gaza City, we have warehouses full of food waiting to be allowed
  in,” the agency said in a post on X. Israeli forces have continued their
  large-scale assault on the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah in
  the occupied West Bank, carrying out raids and widespread destruction of
  property, according to a local official cited by the Wafa news agency. Marzouq
  Abu Naim, the deputy head of the village council, told Wafa that since dawn
  troops had stormed more than 30 homes, issuing threats, destroying property,
  and smashing or seizing dozens of vehicles. Protesters backing a deal for the
  release of hostages in Gaza confronted Israel’s far-right national security
  minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and his son in central Israel, the Times of Israel
  reports. Crowds chanted “shame” and held up posters of hostages still held in
  Gaza. Ben-Gvir – who was barred from serving in the army as a teenager due to
  extremist activities – was heard telling his son, Shoval: “These are draft
  dodgers.” One protester shouted back, calling Ben-Gvir himself a “draft
  dodger”. Action Against Hunger has warned of “extreme vulnerability under the
  mothers and their children that are undernourished” as famine spreads across
  Gaza. The group’s nutrition teams recorded more than 400 cases of malnourished
  children in July and August alone, 20% of them severe. According to UN and
  INGO data, thousands of new cases are being registered each month. Iran’s
  foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has said spoken by phone with his French,
  German and British counterparts in a bid to prevent a vote on UN sanctions
  over Tehran’s nuclear programme, just days ahead of a European deadline. The
  call came as the three European powers threatened to trigger the “snapback”
  provision of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which allows any party to reimpose
  sanctions if they believe Iran is not complying with commitments such as
  international monitoring of its nuclear activities. Dutch Foreign Minister
  Caspar Veldkamp has stepped down after failing to secure cabinet approval for
  additional sanctions on Israel over its war in Gaza. Veldkamp, a member of the
  centre-right New Social Contract party, said he was unable to achieve any
  agreement, while citing “geopolitical tensions”. Turning our attention to the
  occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have continued their large-scale assault on
  the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah, carrying out raids and
  widespread destruction of property, according to a local official cited by the
  Wafa news agency. Marzouq Abu Naim, the deputy head of the village council,
  told Wafa that since dawn troops had stormed more than 30 homes, issuing
  threats, destroying property, and smashing or seizing dozens of vehicles. He
  added that bulldozers were continuing work on a new road through the village,
  destroying thousands of dunums of olive groves. The escalation comes after
  Israel on Wednesday announced its approval of a major new settlement block in
  the West Bank, which far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich suggsted was
  designed to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. On Thursday, UK
  foreign secretary David Lammy joined 20 other foreign ministers in condemning
  the settlement plan. The Foreign Office said it had also summoned the Israeli
  ambassador in London to make Britain’s position clear. The ICJ regards both
  Israeli occupation and settlement building in the West Bank as illegal under
  international law. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has said at
  least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past
  24 hours. The ministry said a number of victims remained under rubble and on
  the streets, with ambulance and civil defence crews unable to reach them.
  According to its daily update, the cumulative death toll in Gaza has risen to
  62,622, with 157,673 injured since 7 October 2023. From when Israel ended the
  ceasefire on March 18, the ministry said 10,778 people have been killed and
  45,632 injured. It noted that 298 fatalities had been added to the tally after
  confirmation by a judicial committee handling missing persons cases. The
  ministry reported that at least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while
  attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of
  what the ministry describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed, and more than
  15,308 injured since the war began. Hospitals also recorded eight new deaths
  due to starvation and malnutrition, including two children, bringing the total
  to 281 deaths from hunger, of whom 114 were children. Karim is a trained nurse
  in his early 20s from Gaza City. He has been displaced by the war 12 times and
  survived an Israeli strike in Rafah. He now lives in the ruins of his former
  home with his parents and four brothers. He kept a diary for the Guardian over
  the course of a week. 3 August 2025 Today, I have to do something a bit
  “exciting”. I’m going to a food distribution point for the first time, what I
  call the death lottery. I’m leaving in about 30 minutes. I’ve said goodbye to
  my family and hugged them all. You never know. 4 August 2025 Do you know the
  series Squid Game? I swear, they’re playing with us just like that. I lay on
  the ground at the aid point in Zikim for almost three hours without moving. If
  anyone moved – like one old man apparently did, they shot him. He got a bullet
  straight in the neck. 6 August 2025 I usually avoid the news. I can’t stand
  watching it – too much pain, too much politics. I scroll through Instagram a
  little, and sometimes I search for scholarships, hoping to find a way out of
  here. I’m desperate to escape with my family. Read the rest of Karim’s account
  here: My life in Gaza: ‘Do you know the series Squid Game?’ The head of the UN
  agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has called on Israel to allow aid into
  Gaza at scale, saying famine in the territory is worsening by the hour. In a
  post on X, Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said: It’s time for
  the Government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza.
  All of those who have influence must use it with determination and a sense of
  moral duty. Every hour counts. He also shared comments from
  Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief
  Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who said the famine confirmed by the IPC report
  should be read “in sorrow and in anger”. Fletcher wrote that the crisis was “a
  famine we could have prevented” but food was being blocked by “systematic
  obstruction by Israel”. In his closing appeal, Fletcher said: “My plea, my
  demand to Prime Minister Netanyahu: Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings,
  north and south … It is too late for far too many. But not for everyone in
  Gaza. Enough. For humanity’s sake, let us in.” It comes after the Israeli
  prime minister claimed yesterday the IPC report was “an absolute lie” and “a
  modern blood libel”. Palestinians endure daily struggle to access humanitarian
  aid The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for an urgent
  scale-up of evacuations from Gaza, warning that more than 15,600 patients
  remain in need of specialised care. In a post on X, WHO director-general
  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the UAE for supporting the latest
  evacuation of critically injured and sick patients but stressed that far more
  action is needed. However, he added that “more than 15 600 patients are in
  need of specialised care, including 3800 children”. “We call for increased
  access to help scale up evacuations from Gaza and more countries to step up
  and offer lifesaving care. Ceasefire!” Other countries have announced similar
  evacuation measures, with the first patients from Palestine expected to arrive
  in the coming weeks, according a UK government press statement released
  yesterday. In contrast, last week, the US State Department has halted the
  issuing of visitor visas for Palestinians arriving for urgent treatment from
  Gaza while it “reviews its approval process”. Aid groups have sharply
  criticised the decision, warning it blocks critically ill children from
  accessing life-saving care. Protesters backing a deal for the release of
  hostages in Gaza confronted Israel’s far-right national security minister,
  Itamar Ben-Gvir, and his son in central Israel, the Times of Israel reports.
  Crowds chanted “shame” and held up posters of hostages still held in Gaza.
  Ben-Gvir – who was barred from serving in the army as a teenager due to
  extremist activities – was heard telling his son, Shoval: “These are draft
  dodgers.” One protester shouted back, calling Ben-Gvir himself a “draft
  dodger”. Another directed her appeal at Shoval, saying: “I know very well, he
  is with you in your unit, he is with you in your unit. You serve with him, and
  your father is leaving the hostages to die. Look at their faces. If you were
  kidnapped, your father would leave you to die.” Ben-Gvir, who is currently
  under UK sanctions for inciting violence against Palestinians, has long
  opposed any deals to secure hostage releases, and for a ceasefire in Gaza. In
  the overcrowded, rubble strewn streets of Gaza City, there was little surprise
  at the announcement that UN-backed experts believed the scenes of desperation
  could now be formally described as a famine. “This is something we have been
  saying for months now, and we have witnessed this and we have been living this
  and suffering this. We feel very powerless and very sick and very tired,” said
  Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO Network, who has been in Gaza
  City throughout the 22-month war. On Friday, the Integrated Food Security
  Phase Classification (IPC), a globally recognised organisation that classifies
  the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition, found that three key
  thresholds for a declaration of famine had been met in the once bustling
  commercial and administrative hub. “This famine is entirely man-made, it can
  be halted and reversed,” the report said. It warned of an exponential increase
  in deaths if “a ceasefire is not implemented … and essential food supplies and
  basic … services are not restored immediately”. Read the full piece here:
  ‘Very sick and very tired’: the reality of famine for Gaza’s most vulnerable
  Action Against Hunger has warned of “extreme vulnerability under the mothers
  and their children that are undernourished” as famine spreads across Gaza.
  Vincent Stehli, the organisation’s head of operations, said: As a result of
  nearly two years of continued forcible transfer, airstrikes, and continuous
  disrupted and little access to food and water, Gaza’s entire population has
  been compelled to rely on humanitarian food aid as a primary source of
  sustenance, with an increasing number of extreme vulnerability under the
  mothers and their children that are undernourished. The group’s nutrition
  teams recorded more than 400 cases of malnourished children in July and August
  alone, 20% of them severe. According to UN and INGO data, thousands of new
  cases are being registered each month. An Action Against Hunger staff member
  in Gaza added: It is important to note that many families do not have the
  resources to arrive at humanitarian nutrition sites to receive treatment.
  Also, there is a lack of nutrition supplies, hindering the capacity to treat
  such cases in a timely manner. We also noted that many breastfeeding and
  pregnant mothers suffer from malnutrition themselves. In May, Action Against
  Hunger said 5,119 children under five were admitted for acute malnutrition – a
  148% rise since February. Admissions rose further to 6,500 in June, the
  highest since October 2023, with over 5,000 more in just the first two weeks
  of July. The Famine Review Committee (FRC) projects that by June 2026, 132,000
  children under five will be at risk of death, including more than 41,000
  severe cases. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has said spoken by
  phone with his French, German and British counterparts in a bid to prevent a
  vote on UN sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear programme, just days ahead of a
  European deadline. The call came as the three European powers threatened to
  trigger the “snapback” provision of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which allows
  any party to reimpose sanctions if they believe Iran is not complying with
  commitments such as international monitoring of its nuclear activities. Iran’s
  parliament voted to suspend all cooperation with the International Atomic
  Energy Agency (IAEA) after Israeli and US airstrikes on its nuclear facilities
  in June, despite ongoing negotiations over the nuclear programme, according to
  Iranian media. After the call, a statement released on Araghchi’s behalf via
  Telegram criticised the three countries’ “legal and moral qualifications” to
  threaten sanctions but insisted that talks would continue. The statement said:
  The Islamic Republic of Iran, just as it acts authoritatively in self-defence,
  has never abandoned the path of diplomacy and is ready for any diplomatic
  solution that guarantees the rights and interests of the Iranian people.
  French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot confirmed on X that the discussions
  had taken place and said another round of talks would happen next week. We
  have just made an important call to our Iranian counterpart regarding the
  nuclear programme and the sanctions against Iran that we are preparing to
  reapply… time is running out. That view was echoed by UK foreign secretary
  David Lammy and the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, while Germany’s Foreign
  Minister Johann Wadephul said: Iran needs to engage substantively in order to
  avoid the activation of snapback. We have been clear that we will not let the
  snapback of sanctions expire unless there is a verifiable and durable deal.
  Any renewed sanctions effort could face pushback from China and Russia, with
  both countries having a veto as permanent members of the UN Security Council.
  At least nine Palestinian civilians have been killed in a series of Israeli
  attacks across Gaza on Saturday, according to Wafa news agency. Local sources
  told Wafa that an Israeli drone strike hit a house in the al-Sabra
  neighbourhood south of Gaza City, killing one civilian and injuring others.
  Another drone attack targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Khan
  Younis, killing two women and injuring 14 others. Emergency services said six
  people were killed and others wounded after Israeli forces opened fire on
  civilians waiting for aid in the north of the enclave. Medical sources cited
  by Wafa said a total of 34 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since dawn
  today. Israeli airstrike on Deir al-Balah, a city in central Gaza. Dutch
  Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp has stepped down after failing to secure
  cabinet approval for additional sanctions on Israel over its war in Gaza.
  Veldkamp, a member of the centre-right New Social Contract party, said he was
  unable to achieve any agreement, while citing “geopolitical tensions”. Late on
  Friday, he said in a post on X: Tonight I announced my decision to step down
  as Minister of Foreign Affairs. It has been a true honour to represent the
  Netherlands on the international stage. We are living in a time of
  unprecedented geopolitical tension, where diplomacy matters more than ever. I
  am deeply grateful for the cooperation with my colleagues in the Netherlands,
  in the European Union, and with international partners worldwide. I would like
  to express my heartfelt gratitude to the dedicated staff of the Ministry of
  Foreign Affairs, who work tirelessly every day to safeguard and promote the
  interests of the Netherlands. During his tenure, Veldkamp had imposed entry
  bans on far-right Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir,
  accusing them of inciting settler violence against Palestinians. He also
  revoked three export licences for Israeli navy ship components. The UN agency
  for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says it has warehouses full of food,
  medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan and Egypt but is being blocked from
  bringing them into Gaza. “While famine is confirmed in Gaza City, we have
  warehouses full of food waiting to be allowed in,” the agency said in a post
  on X. Famine in Gaza City can be stopped. Reverse the ongoing catastrophe –
  flood Gaza with a massive scale up of aid through the United Nations including
  UNRWA. … There is enough food, medicines and hygiene supplies ready to fill
  6,000 trucks. The State of Israel must let us bring aid into Gaza. It comes
  after the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)
  confirmed an “entirely man-made” famine in Gaza City and its surrounding
  areas, warning of an exponential increase in deaths if conditions continue to
  deteriorate. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza
  and wider regional diplomacy. Israel has dismantled the proven and
  internationally backed civilian model of aid distribution in Gaza, according
  to a joint report from Forensic Architecture (FA) and the World Peace
  Foundation (WPF), which said the move has furthered both Israel’s military
  objectives and starvation in the territory. The UN-backed Integrated Food
  Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed famine in Gaza this week. UK
  foreign secretary David Lammy described the situation as a “catastrophic
  humanitarian crisis” and condemned Israel’s refusal to allow sufficient aid
  into the enclave. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the
  famine assessment, saying it ignored what he described as recent humanitarian
  steps by his government. Plan International UK, a children’s charity, said the
  famine was “an entirely man-made hunger catastrophe” that is killing children
  daily. The group warned that 130,000 Palestinian children are threatened by
  malnutrition. Meanwhile, foreign ministers from European countries, Australia
  and the UK condemned Israel’s plans to construct a settlement in the E1 area
  east of Jerusalem, calling the move “unacceptable” and a violation of
  international law. Figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence
  database, seen in a joint investigation by the Guardian, +972 Magazine and
  Local Call, suggest that five out of six Palestinians killed in Gaza are
  civilians. By May, Israeli officials had listed 8,900 Hamas and Palestinian
  Islamic Jihad fighters as dead or “probably dead”. The Red Cross has joined
  international voices condemning Israel’s plan to expand its military
  operations and seize Gaza City, calling the proposal “intolerable.” Relatives
  of Israeli hostages held in Gaza urged Netanyahu’s government to accept a
  proposed ceasefire, warning that rejection would be “a death sentence for the
  living hostages and a sentence of disappearance for the deceased ones.” In
  regional diplomacy, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi and his French,
  British and German counterparts agreed to resume talks next week on nuclear
  and sanctions issues. European powers have warned they could trigger a UN
  “snapback” mechanism to reimpose sanctions if Iran does not return to
  negotiations over its uranium enrichment programme. We will be following
  today’s developments. Stay with us.

It’s nearly 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here’s the latest: The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. It said victims remained under rubble and in the streets, with crews unable to reach them. The Wafa news agency reported that at least nine civilians were killed in separate Israeli strikes across Gaza on Saturday. At least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, the ministry said, bringing the total number of what it describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed and more than 15,308 injured since the war began. Eight people, including two children, died of starvation in Gaza hospitals in the past day, according to health officials. That brings the total number of recorded deaths from hunger to 281, of whom 114 were children. Strikes also targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, home to hundreds of thousands who had fled elsewhere in Gaza. More than half the victims were women and children, the AP reported. In northern Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at least five people waiting for aid near the Zikim crossing, where UN and other agencies’ convoys enter the strip, health officials at Sheikh Radwan field hospital told AP. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, urged more medical evacuations, warning that 15,600 patients, including 3,800 children, need specialised care. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, said famine in Gaza is worsening “by the hour” and urged Israel to let aid in at scale. UNRWA said it has warehouses full of food, medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan and Egypt but has been blocked from bringing them into Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces continued a large-scale assault on the village of al-Mughayyir near Ramallah. Marzouq Abu Naim, deputy head of the village council, told Wafa that troops had stormed more than 30 homes, destroyed property, and smashed or seized dozens of vehicles. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said its clinics around Gaza City are treating large numbers of people as bombardments force further displacement. “Strikes are forcing people, including MSF staff, to flee their homes once again, and we are seeing displacement across Gaza City,” the group said. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he spoke by phone with his French, German and British counterparts to prevent a vote on UN sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear programme, ahead of a European deadline. A senior health official in Gaza has warned of severe overcrowding in a children’s malnutrition clinic as famine in the enclave reaches what he described as a “critical phase”. Ahmed al-Farra, director of the Tahrir hospital for children and maternity at the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis, appeared in a video released by the health ministry showing crowded scenes inside the clinic. In a translation carried by Anadolu news agency, al-Farra said the clinic, which operates only two days a week, is now receiving “three to four times” the expected number of patients. “Each day the clinic is open, no fewer than 52 new cases are diagnosed,” he said. Al-Farra highlighted the case of 18-month-old Shahd Mohammed Zaarab, who weighs just 5.8kg compared to the normal 11–12kg for her age. He said the child was suffering from acute malnutrition, having lost both fat and muscle mass. “Her condition is like a skeleton covered with skin,” he said. Earlier we reported that eight people died of starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has warned that Israel would face a “more crushing response” if it carried out further attacks against the country, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). Major General Mohammad Pakpour made the comments on Saturday during a meeting with Ahmadreza Pourkhaghan, head of the judiciary organisation of the armed forces. Referring to the IRGC’s combat readiness, Pakpour said: If the Zionist regime repeats its aggression against the country, it will receive a more regret-inducing and crushing response than the 12-day war in June. He added that ensuring the safety and security of IRGC personnel would remain a priority “as in the past”. Arif Husain, chief economist at the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), has explained what qualifies as a famine after the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) formally declared one in parts of Gaza. In a video posted to X, Husain said: Famine is a technical term. We say there is a famine when three conditions come together in a specific geographic area. First, at least 20 percent of the population, in that particular place must be facing extreme levels of hunger. Second, 30 percent of the children in the same place must be wasted, they are too tall for their weight, so they’re very skinny basically. And the third condition is that the mortality rate must double from the average of, for adults, one person per 10,000 per day, to two people per 10,000 per day. When these three conditions come together, we say it’s a famine. On Friday, the IPC said an estimated 514,000 people in Gaza – about a quarter of the enclave’s population – are experiencing famine, a figure expected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September. Israel has denied that a famine is taking place, while the United States appeared to dismiss the findings as part of what it called a “false narrative of deliberate mass starvation” promoted by Hamas. Earlier today, we reported that eight people had starved to death in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Gaza’s civil defence service, made up of local emergency crews, say they carried out 39 missions in the past 24 hours as Israeli strikes hit tents sheltering displaced people in the enclave. Crews reported operations in the Beach Camp in the north, and in Rafah to the south, where tents for displaced people were struck by Israeli forces. Patients were taken from attacks near schools, mosques and hospitals, including al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat and tents in the Asdaa area of Rafah, where ten people were rushed to treatment. Civil defence also reported transporting victims from strikes in Khan Younis and Gaza City, including fires in the Rimal neighbourhood. One of the dead was transported from al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, others were injured by gunfire, the civil defence said. The service said the scale of operations underlined the pressure on emergency crews who continue to recover the wounded, and the dead, from across Gaza. With ground troops already active in strategic areas, the widescale operation in Gaza City could start within days, reports the Associated Press (AP). Aid group Doctors without Borders, or Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said on Saturday its clinics around Gaza City are seeing high numbers of patients as people flee recent bombardments. The group said in a statement that “strikes are forcing people, including MSF staff, to flee their homes once again, and we are seeing displacement across Gaza City″. According to the AP, the Israeli military has said troops are operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the city’s Zeitoun neighbourhood. Israeli strikes killed at least 14 people in the southern Gaza Strip early on Saturday, according to morgue records and health officials at Nasser hospital, reports the Associated Press (AP). The officials said the strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, which became home to hundreds of thousands who had fled from elsewhere in Gaza. More than half of the dead were women and children, reported the AP. Awad Abu Agala, uncle of two children who died, told the AP no place in Gaza is now safe. “The entire Gaza Strip is being bombed … In the south. In the north. Everywhere,” Abu Agala said, explaining that the children were targeted overnight while in their tents. In northern Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at least five aid-seekers on Saturday near the Zikim crossing with Israel, where UN and other agencies’ convoys enter the territory, health officials at the Sheikh Radwan field hospital told the AP. Six people were killed in other attacks on Gaza elsewhere Saturday, according to hospitals and the Palestinian Red Crescent. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions from the AP about the deaths. It is 2.49pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is a summary of today’s blog so far: The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza has said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. The ministry said a number of victims remained under rubble and on the streets, with ambulance and civil defence crews unable to reach them. The Wafa news agency reported that at least nine Palestinian civilians had been killed in a series of Israeli attacks across Gaza on Saturday. The ministry reported that at least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of what the ministry describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed, and more than 15,308 injured since the war began. Hospitals in Gaza also recorded eight new deaths due to starvation and malnutrition, including two children, bringing the total to 281 deaths from hunger, of whom 114 were children. Israel has dismantled the proven and internationally backed civilian model of aid distribution in Gaza, according to a joint report from Forensic Architecture (FA) and the World Peace Foundation (WPF), which said the move has furthered both Israel’s military objectives and starvation in the territory. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for an urgent scale-up of evacuations from Gaza, warning that more than 15,600 patients remain in need of specialised care, including 3,800 children. In a post on X, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the UAE for supporting the latest evacuation of critically injured and sick patients but stressed that far more action is needed. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, has called on Israel to allow aid into Gaza at scale, saying famine in the territory is worsening by the hour. He also shared comments from undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who said the famine confirmed by the IPC report should be read “in sorrow and in anger”. Unrwa says it has warehouses full of food, medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan and Egypt but is being blocked from bringing them into Gaza. “While famine is confirmed in Gaza City, we have warehouses full of food waiting to be allowed in,” the agency said in a post on X. Israeli forces have continued their large-scale assault on the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, carrying out raids and widespread destruction of property, according to a local official cited by the Wafa news agency. Marzouq Abu Naim, the deputy head of the village council, told Wafa that since dawn troops had stormed more than 30 homes, issuing threats, destroying property, and smashing or seizing dozens of vehicles. Protesters backing a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza confronted Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and his son in central Israel, the Times of Israel reports. Crowds chanted “shame” and held up posters of hostages still held in Gaza. Ben-Gvir – who was barred from serving in the army as a teenager due to extremist activities – was heard telling his son, Shoval: “These are draft dodgers.” One protester shouted back, calling Ben-Gvir himself a “draft dodger”. Action Against Hunger has warned of “extreme vulnerability under the mothers and their children that are undernourished” as famine spreads across Gaza. The group’s nutrition teams recorded more than 400 cases of malnourished children in July and August alone, 20% of them severe. According to UN and INGO data, thousands of new cases are being registered each month. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has said spoken by phone with his French, German and British counterparts in a bid to prevent a vote on UN sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear programme, just days ahead of a European deadline. The call came as the three European powers threatened to trigger the “snapback” provision of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which allows any party to reimpose sanctions if they believe Iran is not complying with commitments such as international monitoring of its nuclear activities. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp has stepped down after failing to secure cabinet approval for additional sanctions on Israel over its war in Gaza. Veldkamp, a member of the centre-right New Social Contract party, said he was unable to achieve any agreement, while citing “geopolitical tensions”. Turning our attention to the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have continued their large-scale assault on the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah, carrying out raids and widespread destruction of property, according to a local official cited by the Wafa news agency. Marzouq Abu Naim, the deputy head of the village council, told Wafa that since dawn troops had stormed more than 30 homes, issuing threats, destroying property, and smashing or seizing dozens of vehicles. He added that bulldozers were continuing work on a new road through the village, destroying thousands of dunums of olive groves. The escalation comes after Israel on Wednesday announced its approval of a major new settlement block in the West Bank, which far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich suggsted was designed to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. On Thursday, UK foreign secretary David Lammy joined 20 other foreign ministers in condemning the settlement plan. The Foreign Office said it had also summoned the Israeli ambassador in London to make Britain’s position clear. The ICJ regards both Israeli occupation and settlement building in the West Bank as illegal under international law. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has said at least 61 people were killed and 308 injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. The ministry said a number of victims remained under rubble and on the streets, with ambulance and civil defence crews unable to reach them. According to its daily update, the cumulative death toll in Gaza has risen to 62,622, with 157,673 injured since 7 October 2023. From when Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, the ministry said 10,778 people have been killed and 45,632 injured. It noted that 298 fatalities had been added to the tally after confirmation by a judicial committee handling missing persons cases. The ministry reported that at least 16 people were killed and 111 injured while attempting to collect aid in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of what the ministry describes as “aid victims” to 2,076 killed, and more than 15,308 injured since the war began. Hospitals also recorded eight new deaths due to starvation and malnutrition, including two children, bringing the total to 281 deaths from hunger, of whom 114 were children. Karim is a trained nurse in his early 20s from Gaza City. He has been displaced by the war 12 times and survived an Israeli strike in Rafah. He now lives in the ruins of his former home with his parents and four brothers. He kept a diary for the Guardian over the course of a week. 3 August 2025 Today, I have to do something a bit “exciting”. I’m going to a food distribution point for the first time, what I call the death lottery. I’m leaving in about 30 minutes. I’ve said goodbye to my family and hugged them all. You never know. 4 August 2025 Do you know the series Squid Game? I swear, they’re playing with us just like that. I lay on the ground at the aid point in Zikim for almost three hours without moving. If anyone moved – like one old man apparently did, they shot him. He got a bullet straight in the neck. 6 August 2025 I usually avoid the news. I can’t stand watching it – too much pain, too much politics. I scroll through Instagram a little, and sometimes I search for scholarships, hoping to find a way out of here. I’m desperate to escape with my family. Read the rest of Karim’s account here: My life in Gaza: ‘Do you know the series Squid Game?’ The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has called on Israel to allow aid into Gaza at scale, saying famine in the territory is worsening by the hour. In a post on X, Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA commissioner-general, said: It’s time for the Government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza. All of those who have influence must use it with determination and a sense of moral duty. Every hour counts. He also shared comments from Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, who said the famine confirmed by the IPC report should be read “in sorrow and in anger”. Fletcher wrote that the crisis was “a famine we could have prevented” but food was being blocked by “systematic obstruction by Israel”. In his closing appeal, Fletcher said: “My plea, my demand to Prime Minister Netanyahu: Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings, north and south … It is too late for far too many. But not for everyone in Gaza. Enough. For humanity’s sake, let us in.” It comes after the Israeli prime minister claimed yesterday the IPC report was “an absolute lie” and “a modern blood libel”. Palestinians endure daily struggle to access humanitarian aid The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for an urgent scale-up of evacuations from Gaza, warning that more than 15,600 patients remain in need of specialised care. In a post on X, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the UAE for supporting the latest evacuation of critically injured and sick patients but stressed that far more action is needed. However, he added that “more than 15 600 patients are in need of specialised care, including 3800 children”. “We call for increased access to help scale up evacuations from Gaza and more countries to step up and offer lifesaving care. Ceasefire!” Other countries have announced similar evacuation measures, with the first patients from Palestine expected to arrive in the coming weeks, according a UK government press statement released yesterday. In contrast, last week, the US State Department has halted the issuing of visitor visas for Palestinians arriving for urgent treatment from Gaza while it “reviews its approval process”. Aid groups have sharply criticised the decision, warning it blocks critically ill children from accessing life-saving care. Protesters backing a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza confronted Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and his son in central Israel, the Times of Israel reports. Crowds chanted “shame” and held up posters of hostages still held in Gaza. Ben-Gvir – who was barred from serving in the army as a teenager due to extremist activities – was heard telling his son, Shoval: “These are draft dodgers.” One protester shouted back, calling Ben-Gvir himself a “draft dodger”. Another directed her appeal at Shoval, saying: “I know very well, he is with you in your unit, he is with you in your unit. You serve with him, and your father is leaving the hostages to die. Look at their faces. If you were kidnapped, your father would leave you to die.” Ben-Gvir, who is currently under UK sanctions for inciting violence against Palestinians, has long opposed any deals to secure hostage releases, and for a ceasefire in Gaza. In the overcrowded, rubble strewn streets of Gaza City, there was little surprise at the announcement that UN-backed experts believed the scenes of desperation could now be formally described as a famine. “This is something we have been saying for months now, and we have witnessed this and we have been living this and suffering this. We feel very powerless and very sick and very tired,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO Network, who has been in Gaza City throughout the 22-month war. On Friday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition, found that three key thresholds for a declaration of famine had been met in the once bustling commercial and administrative hub. “This famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report said. It warned of an exponential increase in deaths if “a ceasefire is not implemented … and essential food supplies and basic … services are not restored immediately”. Read the full piece here: ‘Very sick and very tired’: the reality of famine for Gaza’s most vulnerable Action Against Hunger has warned of “extreme vulnerability under the mothers and their children that are undernourished” as famine spreads across Gaza. Vincent Stehli, the organisation’s head of operations, said: As a result of nearly two years of continued forcible transfer, airstrikes, and continuous disrupted and little access to food and water, Gaza’s entire population has been compelled to rely on humanitarian food aid as a primary source of sustenance, with an increasing number of extreme vulnerability under the mothers and their children that are undernourished. The group’s nutrition teams recorded more than 400 cases of malnourished children in July and August alone, 20% of them severe. According to UN and INGO data, thousands of new cases are being registered each month. An Action Against Hunger staff member in Gaza added: It is important to note that many families do not have the resources to arrive at humanitarian nutrition sites to receive treatment. Also, there is a lack of nutrition supplies, hindering the capacity to treat such cases in a timely manner. We also noted that many breastfeeding and pregnant mothers suffer from malnutrition themselves. In May, Action Against Hunger said 5,119 children under five were admitted for acute malnutrition – a 148% rise since February. Admissions rose further to 6,500 in June, the highest since October 2023, with over 5,000 more in just the first two weeks of July. The Famine Review Committee (FRC) projects that by June 2026, 132,000 children under five will be at risk of death, including more than 41,000 severe cases. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has said spoken by phone with his French, German and British counterparts in a bid to prevent a vote on UN sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear programme, just days ahead of a European deadline. The call came as the three European powers threatened to trigger the “snapback” provision of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which allows any party to reimpose sanctions if they believe Iran is not complying with commitments such as international monitoring of its nuclear activities. Iran’s parliament voted to suspend all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after Israeli and US airstrikes on its nuclear facilities in June, despite ongoing negotiations over the nuclear programme, according to Iranian media. After the call, a statement released on Araghchi’s behalf via Telegram criticised the three countries’ “legal and moral qualifications” to threaten sanctions but insisted that talks would continue. The statement said: The Islamic Republic of Iran, just as it acts authoritatively in self-defence, has never abandoned the path of diplomacy and is ready for any diplomatic solution that guarantees the rights and interests of the Iranian people. French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot confirmed on X that the discussions had taken place and said another round of talks would happen next week. We have just made an important call to our Iranian counterpart regarding the nuclear programme and the sanctions against Iran that we are preparing to reapply… time is running out. That view was echoed by UK foreign secretary David Lammy and the EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, while Germany’s Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said: Iran needs to engage substantively in order to avoid the activation of snapback. We have been clear that we will not let the snapback of sanctions expire unless there is a verifiable and durable deal. Any renewed sanctions effort could face pushback from China and Russia, with both countries having a veto as permanent members of the UN Security Council. At least nine Palestinian civilians have been killed in a series of Israeli attacks across Gaza on Saturday, according to Wafa news agency. Local sources told Wafa that an Israeli drone strike hit a house in the al-Sabra neighbourhood south of Gaza City, killing one civilian and injuring others. Another drone attack targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, killing two women and injuring 14 others. Emergency services said six people were killed and others wounded after Israeli forces opened fire on civilians waiting for aid in the north of the enclave. Medical sources cited by Wafa said a total of 34 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since dawn today. Israeli airstrike on Deir al-Balah, a city in central Gaza. Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp has stepped down after failing to secure cabinet approval for additional sanctions on Israel over its war in Gaza. Veldkamp, a member of the centre-right New Social Contract party, said he was unable to achieve any agreement, while citing “geopolitical tensions”. Late on Friday, he said in a post on X: Tonight I announced my decision to step down as Minister of Foreign Affairs. It has been a true honour to represent the Netherlands on the international stage. We are living in a time of unprecedented geopolitical tension, where diplomacy matters more than ever. I am deeply grateful for the cooperation with my colleagues in the Netherlands, in the European Union, and with international partners worldwide. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the dedicated staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who work tirelessly every day to safeguard and promote the interests of the Netherlands. During his tenure, Veldkamp had imposed entry bans on far-right Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, accusing them of inciting settler violence against Palestinians. He also revoked three export licences for Israeli navy ship components. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says it has warehouses full of food, medicines and hygiene supplies in Jordan and Egypt but is being blocked from bringing them into Gaza. “While famine is confirmed in Gaza City, we have warehouses full of food waiting to be allowed in,” the agency said in a post on X. Famine in Gaza City can be stopped. Reverse the ongoing catastrophe – flood Gaza with a massive scale up of aid through the United Nations including UNRWA. … There is enough food, medicines and hygiene supplies ready to fill 6,000 trucks. The State of Israel must let us bring aid into Gaza. It comes after the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed an “entirely man-made” famine in Gaza City and its surrounding areas, warning of an exponential increase in deaths if conditions continue to deteriorate. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and wider regional diplomacy. Israel has dismantled the proven and internationally backed civilian model of aid distribution in Gaza, according to a joint report from Forensic Architecture (FA) and the World Peace Foundation (WPF), which said the move has furthered both Israel’s military objectives and starvation in the territory. The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed famine in Gaza this week. UK foreign secretary David Lammy described the situation as a “catastrophic humanitarian crisis” and condemned Israel’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into the enclave. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the famine assessment, saying it ignored what he described as recent humanitarian steps by his government. Plan International UK, a children’s charity, said the famine was “an entirely man-made hunger catastrophe” that is killing children daily. The group warned that 130,000 Palestinian children are threatened by malnutrition. Meanwhile, foreign ministers from European countries, Australia and the UK condemned Israel’s plans to construct a settlement in the E1 area east of Jerusalem, calling the move “unacceptable” and a violation of international law. Figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence database, seen in a joint investigation by the Guardian, +972 Magazine and Local Call, suggest that five out of six Palestinians killed in Gaza are civilians. By May, Israeli officials had listed 8,900 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters as dead or “probably dead”. The Red Cross has joined international voices condemning Israel’s plan to expand its military operations and seize Gaza City, calling the proposal “intolerable.” Relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza urged Netanyahu’s government to accept a proposed ceasefire, warning that rejection would be “a death sentence for the living hostages and a sentence of disappearance for the deceased ones.” In regional diplomacy, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi and his French, British and German counterparts agreed to resume talks next week on nuclear and sanctions issues. European powers have warned they could trigger a UN “snapback” mechanism to reimpose sanctions if Iran does not return to negotiations over its uranium enrichment programme. We will be following today’s developments. Stay with us.
