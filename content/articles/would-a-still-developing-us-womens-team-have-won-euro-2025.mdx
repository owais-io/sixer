  Sunday in Switzerland, England’s Lionesses clawed their way to a second
  straight Euro title after defeating the reigning world champions, Spain, 3-1
  in a penalty shootout. With a record 1.35m watching stateside, at least one
  wondered if, in some alternate universe in which they could play in the Euros,
  they would have won it. Asked that question on a recent episode of The Women’s
  Game podcast, US captain and OL Lyonnes midfielder Lindsey Heaps suggested
  that they could. While debriefing England’s wild quarter-final comeback
  against Sweden with retired World Cup champion Sam Mewis, Heaps began by
  noting the difficulty of comparing Emma Hayes’ program in transition to
  mid-tournament teams: “It’s so hard because we’re obviously missing a lot of
  players,” she said. “But we have a lot of new, young players, inexperienced
  players, that are doing so well. I think it would be so hard to say. Also,
  Emma would fully prepare us for a tournament, and tournament mode. So it’d be
  a little bit different than what we’ve been doing, and how we’ve been
  playing.” But nodding to the team’s psyche, she added: “[It] goes back to
  mentality. I will always say, like, we would be, we would be killing it and
  winning.” The internet, of course, was quick to point out what happened two
  years ago in Melbourne, with some fans seemingly aghast that the team’s belief
  remains intact after an ignominious World Cup exit against European
  opposition. Others, of course, noted last summer’s triumph in Paris, when Emma
  Hayes led the program to its fifth gold medal just 76 days after her first
  training session in charge of the team. This summer’s USWNT team isn’t the
  team it was in 2023, when they suffered their earliest-ever departure from a
  competition they’d dominated. For that matter, it’s also not the team it was
  last year in Paris, or the one it likely will be by the next World Cup. So,
  with the players presently available, in this iteration of the USWNT, would
  they have broken hearts in Switzerland? Probably not. They may not have been
  far off, though. Head-to-head comparisons are imprecise because of changing
  dynamics for the US and their UEFA counterparts over the past few years. But
  the US’s recent record against Euro ‘25 contenders isn’t as bleak as one might
  think, given the still-lingering taste of bitter defeat on the sport’s
  grandest stage. The US has played six of the 16 teams that battled to reach
  Basel during or since the 2023 World Cup. That includes Iceland (twice in
  friendlies), Portugal (2023 World Cup), Germany (twice at the Olympics),
  England (one friendly), the Netherlands (once in a friendly and once at the
  World Cup), and of course, Sweden. Of those nine tests against Euro ‘25
  competitors, the US won five, drew three and lost once in a penalty shootout.
  Four of those wins came against Iceland and Germany, with the other secured
  against the Dutch. That’s not too bad, though half of those teams lost in the
  group stage in Switzerland. Of this summer’s eight quarter-finalists, the
  USWNT has played four and beaten just one of them (Germany) stretching back to
  2022. Unfortunately, while the Olympics were a redemptive run for the felled
  giants, Germany (who they beat twice) were the only Euro team they faced, and
  thus their only opportunity to test a renewed mettle against Uefa opponents.
  That said, they did go on to beat Brazil, who sent France and Spain packing in
  the preceding rounds. It seems probable, given the recently-proven talent of
  the US against competitors like Ireland and Canada (missing players and all)
  that they could reach the knockout phase of this summer’s Euros. But as they
  reached toward the final rounds, or perhaps even the final, they might feel
  the difference between the team available for friendlies this June, and the
  one that won the gold medal. Most notably, that includes the formidable force
  propelling the team to glory at both ends of the pitch. Along the frontline:
  ‘triple espresso’ and their combined ten goals. At the other end: Alyssa
  Naeher. Naeher’s 22 saves at the Paris Olympics were inseparable from success,
  as they included a record four shutouts (the most for any US keeper at the
  Games), 12 knockout round saves and seven against Germany alone in a hotly
  contested semi-final. There are hopeful contenders to fill those enormous
  shoes, including Manchester United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. But at
  this moment, the team is far away from having the tried and trusted hands of
  Naeher available to support them. Especially given the plethora of penalties
  that in many ways defined this Euros (for goalkeepers and penalty takers
  alike), the present keeper pool is too untested on that type of stage to say
  confidently they’re ready to pull through like Naeher did at the Olympics. At
  the other end of the pitch, Swanson, Rodman and Smith were not simply
  goalscorers that were fun to watch. They were big moment players capable of
  changing the game individually, with big tournament pressure and all the
  world’s eyes on their back. Their prolonged absence has forced the opportunity
  to find new ways and players to score, and in recent windows a number of names
  have shown their skill in the final third (that somehow includes defensive
  midfielder Sam Coffey, who ended the June window with three goals in five
  games while cementing her name in Emma Hayes midfield). Beyond Coffey, it’s
  been encouraging to observe new combinations of attackers work on ways to
  break down opponents and score goals. The skill is there, but the finished
  product is a work in progress. And the gamechanging greatness of triple
  espresso in Paris is a hard spark to immediately replace. (By 2027, they may
  not have to). Emma Hayes delivered gold 76 days after her first training
  session. Today, 14 months into her long-term project, the US is certainly on
  track to compete with the top competitors from this summer’s Euros. If they
  were thrown into the fray in Switzerland this summer, they’d have been
  competitive, but are likely a few years off from being a team ready to take
  the top prize.
