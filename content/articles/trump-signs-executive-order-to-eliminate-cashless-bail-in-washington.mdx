  Donald Trump on Monday signed two executive orders aimed at eliminating
  cashless bail for people accused of crimes in Washington DC and other
  jurisdictions, an escalation in his efforts to take control of law enforcement
  in the capital city and beyond. The executive orders direct Washington and
  other localities to end their cashless bail programs, which allow people
  charged with crimes to leave jail while they await trial without paying what
  can be large sums of money. The order says that the federal government will
  reconsider funding decisions, services or approvals if Washington does not
  comply. One order also instructs the attorney general, Pam Bondi, to identify
  jurisdictions across the US that have cashless bail policies and revokes
  federal funds and grants that go to those jurisdictions, according to the
  White House. “They kill people and they get out,” Trump said about cashless
  bail in the Oval Office when he announced the order. “We’re ending it, but
  we’re starting by ending it in DC, and that we have the right to do through
  federalization,” he added. Data shows that crime does not increase by any
  significant margin in places that have implemented cashless bail programs, as
  Washington did in 1992, and people released from prison without posting bond
  are extremely unlikely to commit violent crime. Nevertheless, Trump has taken
  aim at the policy and claimed it has contributed to the city’s violent crime
  rate, which last year hit a 30 year low. Washington was one of the first
  jurisdictions to enact cashless bail, starting a trend of cities and states
  moving to a system that doesn’t lock people up for their inability to pay. In
  2023, Illinois became the first state to enact cashless bail. “You don’t even
  have to go to court sometimes,” Trump claimed falsely about Illinois in the
  White House Monday. Trump has also falsely said that under cashless bail
  policies, “somebody murders somebody and they’re out on no cash bail before
  the day is out.” In Washington and other places with cashless bail, a judge
  can make a determination to detail someone pre-trial if they feel that the
  accused is a danger to the community or a flight risk, as is often the case
  with those accused of murder. Jeremy Cherson, the director of communications
  for the Bail Project said Trump’s executive order would deepen inequities and
  waste taxpayer dollars. The Bail Project is a national organization that
  pushes for bail-related policy change and provides free bail assistance to low
  income people. “The data is clear that bail reform has not led to increased
  crime,” he said. “While the president is right that the current system is
  broken, he is wrong about the solution.” “What we’re pursuing is a system
  where safety, not wealth, determines release pretrial, and if you look at a
  lot of the jurisdictions across the country that have minimized or eliminated
  the use of cash bail, that’s what their systems do.”
