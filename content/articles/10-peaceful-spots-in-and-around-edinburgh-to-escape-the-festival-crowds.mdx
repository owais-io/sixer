  Bruntsfield Links To the south of popular parkland the Meadows, Bruntsfield
  Links offers a quieter, calmer stretch of green, free of Big Top
  entertainment. Book a table at cute wine bar and cafe Margot for brunch and
  order french toast with ginger-poached pears and bay-leaf custard, or hot
  smoked trout with leek fritters. Later in the day stop by for oysters, small
  plates and natural wine by the glass. Bag a window-seat or a table outside to
  enjoy views of Arthur’s Seat, which at sunset seems to glow pink and gold.
  Sister restaurant LeftField on the same corner is gorgeous for an elegant
  dinner with the same incredible views. Portobello beach This is Edinburgh’s
  seaside so hardly a secret, and on hot days it does get busy. However,
  compared with beaches on England’s south coast, it might as well be the
  Hebrides. Only the middle few sections nearest the cafes get truly crowded and
  it’s such a long stretch that there’s plenty of space to find your own little
  sandy idyll. Head to Shrimp Wreck for a fishfinger sarnie, or pick up a slice
  of Civerino’s pizza and a local Bellfield beer. Unsurprisingly there’s
  excellent ice-cream to be found; try a scoop at Oscar’s Gelato. Lothian Buses
  19 or 26 from Princes Street. Hidden closes on the Royal Mile Edinburgh’s
  Royal Mile is the centre of the festival action, but even here there are quiet
  escapes, usually into a close, the narrow alleyways that make Edinburgh’s Old
  Town so unique. Dunbar’s Close is a favourite, off Canongate towards the
  bottom of the Royal Mile. It’s a 17th-century-styled formal garden with
  benches and one of the city’s most tranquil hideaways. Pick up a delicious
  direct-trade Brazilian coffee and pastel de nata from Santu Coffee and enjoy
  the peace, just steps from the party. Similarly, Lady Stair’s Close, home to
  the free Writers’ Museum, is ideal for a quick breather. You’ll find it just
  off the Lawnmarket towards the top of the Royal Mile. The Shore, Leith Often
  compared to Copenhagen, this is Edinburgh’s waterfront eating and drinking
  destination. Do what the locals do and sit by the river with a cold pint of
  local beer from Malt and Hops, or discover the tap room at Moonwake Beer Co.
  Try a huge takeaway sandwich from Domenico’s for lunch – pre-order for speed.
  Or for indoor dining, new seafood restaurant Barry Fish is the hottest
  reservation this summer. Edinburgh Trams to the Shore. The Royal Botanic
  Garden and Canonmills A true jewel in Edinburgh’s crown, the lush Royal
  Botanic Garden spans 72 acres with a collection dating back to the 17th
  century. Catch your breath among the trees, and don’t miss the panoramic views
  of the Edinburgh skyline from the lawns of Inverleith House. Nearby, I rate
  Singapore Coffee House for kaya toast and slow-cooked eggs, or roti canai with
  pickled vegetables. Traditional cafe Betty and George is a cosy spot for tea
  and cake or a bowl of soup. For a more formal meal, The Tollhouse has a great
  set lunch and overlooks the river. Lothian Buses 9, 23 or 27 from The Mound.
  Stockbridge This bustling neighbourhood is a home to many of the city’s best
  restaurants, yet escapes much of the festival madness. For a top-tier picnic
  head to Herbie of Edinburgh for deli treats, or Mootz General Store for
  freshly baked schiacciata sandwiches – the classic is mortadella,
  stracciatella soft cheese and pistachio pesto. If you can bear the queue, add
  perfect patisserie from cult bakery Lannan. Enjoy your wares in Inverleith
  Park, there’s a big pond with swans and ducks, mature trees, and if you’re
  travelling with children, a good playpark. You can also walk from Stockbridge
  along a pretty wooded stretch of the Water of Leith path. For a slap-up
  Italian trattoria-style lunch, try Sotto or the excellent value set lunch at
  Stockbridge Eating House. Lothian Buses 29, 33 or 37 from South Bridge.
  Newhaven Take the tram to the final stop and discover Newhaven harbour. Walk
  along the waterfront to Wardie Bay, a tucked away beach and a favourite local
  swimming spot. Return to Newhaven and order fish and chips from The Fishmarket
  to eat outside watching the boats bob in the harbour. Maybe stay for the
  sunset with a cold glass of wine on the terrace, then it’s an easy tram back
  to the city centre. Edinburgh Trams to Newhaven. Arthur’s Seat and Holyrood
  Park A city with a mountain in the middle? Pretty iconic, and also the perfect
  place to feel miles away from it all. The main route to the top can get busy,
  but there’s a network of paths around the park to explore. Check the
  noticeboards and do stick to the paths, there are steep drops. For an easy
  option, follow Queens Drive around the bottom of the mountain, taking in
  Dunsapie Loch and St Margaret’s Loch and giving 360-degree views of the city,
  across the Forth to Fife and to the Pentland Hills. It takes about an hour and
  a half to walk and is bike, buggy and wheelchair friendly. Pick up a sandwich
  from Alby’s Southside to take with you. Union Canal: Fountainbridge The canal
  and accompanying path goes all the way to Glasgow through Falkirk, so you can
  walk for miles if you feel so inclined. Start at Lochrin Basin, then stroll to
  Harrison Park (1.2 miles), past brightly painted residential houseboats and
  the Leamington Lift Bridge. For a longer walk, continue to Slateford Aqueduct
  (2.5 miles) which carries the canal for 152 metres above the Water of Leith
  and the road below. A path beside the bridge takes you to the Water of Leith
  Conservation Trust visitor centre, loos and a cafe. In the area, try welcoming
  Kafe Kweer for coffee, pastries and hearty vegetarian lunches, or The Fountain
  for pub food and pints before retracing your steps back along the canal, duly
  refreshed. The Pitt, Granton Newly reopened in a new location earlier this
  year, The Pitt is a street-food destination worth knowing about. It’s on the
  waterfront at Granton with views across the Firth of Forth, easily accessible
  by bike or a 10-minute walk from the bus stop. Vendors change but currently
  include Choola Nepalese street food and Lebanese wraps from Lazeez. There’s a
  big indoor bar area and regular events. On site you’ll also find Soul Water
  Sauna, with two saunas and cold water plunge pools: a unique way to work up an
  appetite. From here you can walk along the promenade to Cramond village (2.3
  miles) and if the tides are right, even walk out to Cramond island over the
  causeway. Lothian Buses 22 from Lothian Road to Waterfront Avenue then a
  10-minute walk. The Pitt is open Thursday to Sunday. Lothian Buses and
  Edinburgh Trams are contactless, tap on and tap off, single fares are £2.20,
  capped at £5 per day. Download the Edinburgh Bus and Tram app to plan routes
  and track bus times.
