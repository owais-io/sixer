  With the change of season, ministers know they must get back on the front foot
  after weeks during which their opponents have made the political weather. The
  launch of a new, more generous regime for funding early years education in
  England should help. The first of September was keenly awaited by hundreds of
  thousands of working parents of children aged between nine months and four. As
  of now, they are entitled to 30 free childcare or nursery hours a week. The
  education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is right to stress that this is the
  biggest-ever expansion of early years provision – described by the Institute
  for Fiscal Studies as “a new branch of the welfare state”. Equivalent to about
  £7,500 per year, per child, this is worth more, to most women in full-time
  work, than abolishing their income tax and national insurance contributions.
  Working-age parents, particularly those with larger families, have been dealt
  with less generously by the tax and benefits systems in recent years than
  under the Blair and Brown governments. The UK has higher childcare costs than
  most leading economies. So it is right that parents of the youngest children
  are targeted with support. Implementation will need to be closely monitored,
  however. Most of the new funding will flow to private providers. Ms Phillipson
  is a strong advocate for new nurseries attached to primary schools, but these
  are small in number. Families are being given additional funding, but not a
  new public service. The new subsidy will not cover fees in full. Many
  nurseries face shortages of trained staff, while the number of childminders –
  usually women working at home – keeps on falling. While there are many good
  private and non-profit nurseries, as well as public ones overseen by councils,
  there is cause for concern about the way that this market has developed. As in
  children’s social care and special needs education, private-equity owned
  businesses control a growing number of settings. Last year, academics
  published research showing that privately run care homes were
  disproportionately likely to be closed by regulators. In children’s social
  care, the Competition and Markets Authority judged that private owners were
  making excessive profits and carrying too much debt, leading to unacceptable
  risks. Ministers must ensure that such shocking failures are not repeated in
  the nursery sector. As a first step, Ofsted inspections should increase from
  their current six-yearly cycle to a four-yearly one – the same as schools. The
  current disparity sends a terrible signal about early years’ lowly status.
  Another issue is the impact of the changes on poorer children who do not meet
  the eligibility criteria because their parents do not work or do not meet the
  £9,518 earnings threshold. While some vulnerable families already qualify for
  additional childcare, experts are right to worry that the existing attainment
  gap could grow as a result of a policy that grants extra funding to
  under‑fives from wealthier homes. This is the logical but troubling
  consequence of a policy whose chief aim is to enable parents to work, rather
  than invest in early years education as an intrinsic good. The hope must be
  that rules change if these fears are realised, and that “family hubs” – which
  the Tories brought in after vandalising Sure Start – make a contribution to
  these families’ welfare in the meanwhile. Ms Phillipson has a lot on her
  plate. Extra spending on early years is welcome – but it needs proper
  oversight.
