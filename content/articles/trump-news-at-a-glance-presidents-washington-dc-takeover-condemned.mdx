  Donald Trump has seized control of Washington DC’s police force and ordered
  the national guard to the capital in an extraordinary move that bypassed the
  city’s elected leaders. The US president claimed his actions were needed to
  “rescue” Washington from a wave of lawlessness – but experts say his portrayal
  of crime there is rooted in false and misleading claims. “We’re going to take
  our capital back,” Trump said, adding he would also be “getting rid of the
  slums”. Trump warned that other major US cities with Democratic leadership
  could be next, including Chicago. “Hopefully LA is watching.” As he spoke,
  protesters against the move gathered outside the White House, while DC
  officials called his actions illegal. Here are the day’s key US politics
  stories at a glance. Trump seizes control of Washington DC police Donald Trump
  has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the
  city’s police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways that are sharply at
  odds with official crime statistics. The US president’s move was swiftly
  condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political
  independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to
  be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the Guardian. Read the

  Heritage Foundation economist as labor statistics chief The president has
  announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative
  Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics. The nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika

  Gavin Newsom urges Trump to abandon Texas redistricting effort Texas Democrats
  once again stymied a Republican effort to redraw the state’s congressional
  maps at Donald Trump’s behest and California governor Gavin Newsom urged the

  Monday to deny the Republican-led state legislature the quorum necessary to
  proceed with Trump’s desired congressional map. Read the full story Veterans

  Veterans Affairs has lost thousands of healthcare professionals deemed “core”
