  READY FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP? When Football Daily were a lad and everything about
  football was much better, top-flight referees were able to go about their
  business unencumbered by nothing more hi-tech and new-fangled than a
  wrist-watch, a coin, a whistle, red and yellow cards, and a stubby little
  pencil they could’ve half-inched from the betting shop. Fast forward several
  decades and while the standard of officiating remains much the same, advances
  in the fields of both technology and vanishing foam dictate that Premier
  League refs are now forced to include spray cans, headsets and now body
  cameras on the list of items to be ticked off their pre-match checklists
  before they can lead teams out on to the pitch. The news that several of those
  tasked with dispensing on-field justice will be testing Ref Cams in selected
  matches throughout the first round of fixtures this weekend was broken by Big
  Website earlier, meaning some or all of Jarred Gillett, Anthony Taylor and
  Chris Kavanagh will be joining assorted other frontline workers who are forced
  to go about their business wearing an electronic all-seeing eye to record
  their professional activities. However, unlike the police, Wetherspoons bar
  staff and some of their grassroots brethren, these members of the PGMOL match
  officials will not be using them for safety and security measures, but in the
  interests of further enhancing the viewing experience of TV viewers at home.
  This latest televisual wheeze has been approved by Ifab, self-styled
  “independent guardians” of the rules of association football, a body you’d
  think might be better served sorting out the increasingly impenetrable
  shambles that is the handball law, rather than greenlighting new and
  innovative ways to show everyone how utterly unfit for purpose it continues to
  be. Already used in Copa Gianni, where it offered viewers the shaky and
  largely unhelpful on-pitch POV of a wheezing man struggling to keep up with
  elite athletes while running around a furnace, this new technology has
  apparently been embraced by broadcasters who, with the exception of one that
  happens to sponsor this email and is therefore beyond reproach of any kind,
  are always looking for new ways to try to justify the increases in their
  already exorbitant monthly subscriptions. The PGMOL, whose employees will be
  wearing the Ref Cams, is also understood to be wholeheartedly in favour of
  this innovation, having arrived at the misguided and almost certainly
  incorrect conclusion that in providing fans with further insights into how
  difficult a referee’s job can be, it will help reduce the amount of abuse to
  which they are subjected. Good luck with that one, lads. In other news for TV
  viewers, Sky Sports have announced the roll-out of a new “multiview” feature,
  which will allow more febrile armchair conspiracy theorists to reach
  unprecedented levels of apoplexy over decisions made in four different matches
  shown on one screen at the same time. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Scott Murray
  from 8pm BST for hot minute-by-minute coverage of PSG 3-1 Tottenham in, er,
  Biggest Cup. QUOTE OF THE DAY “We’ve been way below where we deem [Manchester]
  United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do,
  especially over the last six months – what do you expect? People say we’ve
  been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the
  transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet” – oof,
  Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford gives his parent club both barrels, assessing
  that constantly changing managers, ideas and strategies has left United stuck
  in “no man’s land”. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS As an Atlético member of 13 years
  standing, can I throw a few more comments into the mix of La Liga’s anti-fan
  policies (yesterday’s Football Daily)? Want to book flights and accommodation
  to Spain to catch a game? Oh wait, you won’t know the date or even the time
  the nominal Sunday game will be played until a fortnight beforehand: Saturday,
  Sunday or even Friday or Monday (unless Barça or Real Madrid, natch). Fancy a
  midweek game then? Always Tuesday or Wednesday? Oh sorry, Barça have the Copa
  del Rey coming up so let’s switch other fixtures around to suit TV. Let’s go
  for Thursday with minimum notice. To hell with fans who’ve spent hundreds on
  flights, hotels and match tickets. And while we’re at it, let’s kick off at
  9.30pm. Bitter? Moi?” – Rob Ford. Big Website worlds collide! Yesterday’s
  Football Daily had an excellent photo of Vice-era Tubbs wearing a stunning
  teal/turquoise suit. And the kit review linked to this Wolves away kit” – Mike
  Wilner. If you have any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
  Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Rob Ford. Terms and
  conditions for our competitions, when we run them, can be viewed here. 
  RECOMMENDED LISTENING Join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Liew and
  Jordan Jarrett-Bryan for the first of our Premier League preview pods: Arsenal
  to Fulham. RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden,
  Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson, Nicky
  Bandini and Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered football punditry at
