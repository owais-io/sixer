  In 2022, at the newly elected Labor government’s jobs and skills summit,
  economist Danielle Wood put women in the workforce front and centre. “I can’t
  help but reflect that if untapped women’s workforce participation was a
  massive ore deposit, we would have governments lining up to give tax
  concessions to get it out of the ground,” she said. As the CEO of the Grattan
  Institute, Wood had long been a powerful advocate for women to create a more
  productive economy. “Productivity,” she said, “might be easy to dispel as the
  niche fetish of econocrats and AFR journalists.” Yet here we are almost
  exactly three years later, with productivity front and centre at the
  government’s economic reform roundtable. In the room are the women who now
  lead Australia’s three most powerful economic institutions. Wood herself is
  now the head of the Productivity Commission, alongside the first ever female
  Treasury secretary, Jenny Wilkinson, and Michele Bullock as governor of the
  Reserve Bank. Sign up: AU Breaking News email As Assoc Prof Duygu Yengin has
  written, research shows that this provides an immense opportunity, in that
  male and female economists often think differently, about “labour markets,
  taxation, health and the environment, and more broadly on public spending –
  everything from welfare to the military”. Labor has done some good work so far
  on the gender pay gap and participation by boosting wages in low paid
  feminised industries, but women still had to work 50 extra days on average
  into this financial year to earn the same as men did last year. The iron ore
  deposit has not yet been properly mined. When Sam Mostyn, who is now the
  governor general, delivered the Women’s Economic Equality Taskforce (Weet)
  report as chair in August 2023, it showed that thousands of Australian women
  who were interviewed across the country want secure work and respect. If we
  are to achieve this, and the productivity gains that will result, we must as a
  nation advance gender equality in the workplace together with women’s safety.
  The absence of both is a handbrake on the potential of Australian women and
  girls, our society and our economy. In its submission to the roundtable,
  violence prevention agency Our Watch points out the economic cost of violence
  against women in Australia which “is estimated at $21.7 billion annually, with
  at least $4.7 billion as government expenditure, including $1.9 billion in
  lost productivity”. Those are the costs of women being killed, beaten,
  sexually assaulted, families fleeing, crisis housing, legal support, physical
  and mental health responses and more. All services are chronically
  underfunded. Increased investment in primary prevention is far better than any
  attempted cure, just as the Productivity Commission itself pointed out in
  relation to healthcare in one of its pre-roundtable papers. Meanwhile,
  Australia ranks equal first in the world for women’s education but is much
  lower down the list for women’s economic opportunity. Australian women are
  less likely to work full-time than women in many other OECD countries. Most
  casual workers are women. Women still do most of the unpaid care work, which
  is essential in keeping the economy functioning. As the National Foundation
  for Australian Women notes in its submission, “Australia fails to value unpaid
  caring work, yet this is an underpinning requirement of reproducing and
  maintaining the labour force and an important component of economy-wide
  productivity.” Women also do most of the low paid care work. In the early
  childhood education sector, for example, 92% of workers are women. There has
  been little to no productivity growth in the care sector for two decades. Yet
  the care economy is the single largest employer in Australia and our fastest
  growing industry as measured by job growth, by a long way. We must further
  address the gender super gap and continue working on the stubborn gender pay
  gap. Female workforce participation is rising but we still get paid less, we
  still work fewer paid hours, we still work more unpaid hours, we still save
  less super, and when we hit 55, we’re at the highest risk of homelessness of
  any demographic. Wood, Wilkinson, Bullock and Mostyn can help drive the
  response to this, but they remain outliers. Women are still significantly
  under-represented in leadership positions in the Australian workforce. WGEA
  data shows female CEOs are paid an average of $158,632 less than male peers.
  Women make up just 22% of CEOs, 37% of key management roles, and 42% of
  managers. Just 34% of board members are women – and one in four boards have no
  women at all. Empowering women is good economic policy and is more than “nice
  to have”, as one male finance journalist once described to me in the halls of
  parliament. This watershed economic debate should be about enabling the
  wellbeing and prosperity of everyone in the nation. That would be a productive
  outcome. Zoe Daniel is a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and former
