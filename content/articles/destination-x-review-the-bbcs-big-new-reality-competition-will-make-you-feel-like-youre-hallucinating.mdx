  It’s The Traitors on a bus! It’s Race Across the World in blindfolds! It’s the
  BBC’s new reality competition series, Destination X! The premise is simple. A
  baker’s dozen of contestants assemble at Baden-Baden airport in Germany, from
  where they are transported via helicopter and a luxuriously appointed coach
  with blacked-out windows to various mysterious locations in Europe – one an
  episode – taking part in challenges en route to earn clues to help them work
  out where they are. At the end of each episode, the contestants enter the “map
  room” and indicate where they think they are by placing an X. The person who
  is least accurate is thrown under the bus. The overall winner will net
  £100,000. The US version is presented by Jeffrey Dean Morgan – an unsettling
  choice for those of us who associate him inextricably with his grotesquely
  violent character in The Walking Dead, but perhaps Americans feel the need to
  be protected as they venture into the wilds of Europe in a way that, even
  post-Brexit, Britons do not. Whatever the reason, we have gone for a warmer,
  less armed-with-a-barbed-wire-wrapped-baseball-bat approach and given the gig
  to Rob Brydon, in an array of natty suits. “I’m actually Anton Du Beke,” he
  jokes. The contestants are as carefully cast as ever. We have the sweet,
  hapless contingent – foremost among them 23-year-old James, who has been on
  holiday only once without his mum and dad and who describes himself, on this
  voyage predicated on deep geographical knowledge and cultural inference, as
  “not the best traveller”. We have the feelings-first brigade, led by poor
  Deborah, a crime author who is consumed by guilt and self-loathing when she is
  required to tell a white lie in pursuit of a competitive advantage. Then there
  are the terrifyingly competitive types, such as the endurance athlete Nick,
  who was the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world and
  fibrillates with energy and ambition (“I wouldn’t let a child win something,
  no”), and the surf school director Ben, hiding his tendencies a bit better
  under a bonhomous mien and a shock of blond hair. But we see you, Ben. This
  isn’t our first rodeo. Credit where it’s due, though – it’s Ben who takes one
  look at the tiny toilet on their coach and suggests they make it a rule that
  everyone has to sit down “for everything”. Ben has four children. As is now de
  rigueur in reality competition series, a good chunk of the cohort do not make
  it past the preliminary stage. Three of the 13 fail the first challenge and
  don’t even make it out of the departure lounge. The remaining 10 go on a
  disorienting 125-mile helicopter ride, during which Judith, a 28-year-old
  nuclear engineer, notes that they are flying backwards with the sun to their
  right and therefore probably southwards. Dawn reckons that flicking through
  her toddler’s atlas before she set out is likely to have given her the edge.
  The challenges and rewards are, of course, set up to sow division, requiring
  alliances and betrayals as the journey unfolds (“I think my competitiveness
  will alienate me,” says Nick). This will have to be enough to keep viewers
  watching, because the challenges are baffling. At one point, the contestants
  find themselves in a picture-lined cubicle in the middle of an unknown market
  square “bordered by two countries and influenced by all three” and must answer
  multipart questions to earn the right to peek out of one of two windows; one
  gives a clue to their location and the other is a red herring, with no way of
  discerning which is which. A further clue will be presented to the participant
  who has given the most right answers – although we don’t know what they are –
  who is then allowed to tell one other person what it is. Are we in Vienna? Or
  Amsterdam? It becomes slightly hallucinatory and I truly do not know what is
  going on. Viewers are invited to play along via QR codes and place their own
  Xs in a virtual map room. This is more involvement in my small-screen
  entertainment than I like to undertake. But have at it if that’s what floats
  your boat – possibly down a Dutch canal. Also, where do they speak Flemish,
  because the local people sound very unusual here, but the street signs are in
  French, despite there being a Café Mozart – what gives? Destination X does not
  close like a vice around you in the manner of The Traitors, nor does it have
  the cockle-warming aspect of Race Across the World. But it’s fun to go along
  for the ride. • Destination X aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer
