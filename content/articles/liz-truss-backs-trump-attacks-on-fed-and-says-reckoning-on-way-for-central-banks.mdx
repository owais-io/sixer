  Donald Trump’s assault on the independence of the US Federal Reserve has been
  backed by Liz Truss, the shortest-serving British prime minister in history,
  who was ousted after a meltdown in the financial markets. The former
  Conservative leader, who during her 49 days in power in late 2022 railed
  against the “deep state” and the Bank of England for undermining her before
  she was ejected from office by her own party, said a “reckoning” was coming
  for the world’s most powerful central banks. “I think there is a reckoning
  coming for the central banks, not just in Britain but also in the United
  States, also the ECB [European Central Bank],” she told Bloomberg’s Odd Lots
  podcast. Truss, who repeatedly criticised “economic orthodoxy” during her
  brief spell in Downing Street, argued that unelected central banks were able
  to undermine elected politicians. “It’s also very difficult, as I found as
  prime minister, to combine fiscal and monetary policy if you don’t hold one of
  the levers. So I think it’s got to change,” she said. Truss, who lost her
  parliamentary seat in last year’s general election, said the UK faced an
  “economic doom loop” of higher taxes, lower growth and higher debt under
  Labour. In recent weeks, long-term UK government borrowing costs have risen
  close to the highest levels since 1998. Investors have blamed a global rise in
  borrowing costs linked to US market conditions, but also UK-specific concerns
  as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is said to be considering raising taxes at
  the autumn budget. Trump this week escalated his attack on the Fed by saying
  he was firing one of its governors, Lisa Cook. The president has applied
  sustained pressure to the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell, with
  demands for a cut in interest rates. Leading investors and economists have
  said political interference damages the credibility of central banks to keep
  inflation under control. US government borrowing costs have risen sharply in
  recent months amid concern over the impact Trump’s tariff policies could have
  and questions over Fed independence. Olli Rehn, a member of the ECB’s governor
  council, warned on Thursday that Trump’s challenge to the Fed could come with
  significant costs for the global economy. Fed independence had remained an
  important principle since the 1980s, said Rehn, who is also the governor of
  Finland’s central bank. “Now, however, this principle is wobbling badly. This
  could have substantial, global knock-on effects on both the financial markets
  and the real economy.” Central banks have become a target for populist
  politicians on both sides of the political divide in recent years amid
  frustrations over lacklustre economic growth and stalling progress to raise
  living standards since the 2008 financial crisis. In the UK, the Bank of
  England was granted independence to set interest rates in 1998 by Gordon
  Brown, then the Labour chancellor, to demonstrate a commitment to keeping
  inflation under control. Its remit is set by the chancellor, with a target to
  maintain price stability and to support the economic objectives of the
  government. Its governor is appointed by the monarch to a fixed term on the
  recommendation of the chancellor. Since leaving office, Truss has repeatedly
  blamed the Bank for the bond market turmoil that contributed to her downfall.
  She revealed last year that she considered sacking its governor, Andrew
  Bailey, but said she did not have time and feared it would cause a financial
  market crisis. Truss’s disastrous mini-budget, which included £45bn of
  unfunded tax cuts, took place against a febrile backdrop in the markets as
  government borrowing costs rose around the world, which her own economic
  advisers warned meant a cautious approach was warranted. Over four days after
  the event, long-term UK government bond yields rose by more than the annual
  increase in 23 of the past 27 years, before the Bank stepped in with emergency
  support to prevent pension funds from going bust. The pound collapsed to its
  lowest level since 1985 as global investor confidence in Truss’s government
  evaporated, and analysts spoke of a “moron premium” for UK assets.
