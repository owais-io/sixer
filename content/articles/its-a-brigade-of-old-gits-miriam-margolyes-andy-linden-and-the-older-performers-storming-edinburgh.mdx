  Miriam Margolyes is ensconced in the garden room of a fancy Edinburgh hotel,
  framed by tasteful greenery and smiling for a fan who wants a selfie.
  Apple-cheeked and foul-mouthed, she is gracious with the passing stranger,
  though she warns me later: “If somebody pisses me off, I’ll say: ‘Now listen
  to me, I’m 84!’” She pauses. “But I don’t see why they should!” she adds with
  a laugh. Margolyes is returning to Edinburgh for the second year running with
  an upgraded version of her acclaimed showcase based on the characters of
  Charles Dickens, her favourite author. “Same old cunt, even older,” reads the
  flyer. “It could be the last time, but don’t bank on it!” The Edinburgh
  festival fringe is world-famous for the diversity of its acts, but industry
  and media attention is easily distracted and the appetite for bold new talent
  and fresh voices often equates – deliberately or otherwise – with youth. Yet
  this year offers a “brigade of old gits”, as the actor Andy Linden says, some
  of them veterans such as Margolyes who first performed there with Cambridge
  University Footlights in 1963, and others remarkably making their debuts in
  their 70s and 80s. “I’m very lucky,” says Margolyes, whose legion of fans
  straddle generations and have delighted in her performances in Blackadder,
  Harry Potter and her appearances on The Graham Norton Show. “There’s
  relatively few people of my age still working.” And there is “nothing like a
  live audience”, she adds: “It’s like a kiss, it’s a caress.” “I just enjoy
  doing it so much,” she continues, running through some of the characters she
  brings to the stage with “shape-shifting flair”, as one reviewer put it. “My
  favourites like Mrs Gamp, Miss Havisham, I think I’m a perfect person to give
  voice to these amazing creations of which there were very many. So it’s a bit
  of a wank, really,” she concludes cheerily. Margolyes describes an “immediate
  feeling of joy and competence” when she steps out in front of an audience
  these days. Has she always felt as if she knows what she’s doing on stage?
  “No, it has come with time. What I am conscious of now is that people know who
  I am and that is really relatively recent.” Just as confidence comes with age,
  so does a responsibility to use her profile to speak out on behalf of those
  who don’t have such a platform. Most recently Margolyes, who is Jewish, has
  faced a backlash for her strident criticism of the actions of the Israeli
  government in Gaza. “People say: ‘You’re just an actor, for fuck’s sake, shut
  up.’ Well, that is a point of view. I don’t happen to share that. I think that
  if you have a chance to make an impact for good, to change things, then you
  should. I think it’s an absolute requirement, and people don’t, out of fear
  sometimes. They are afraid of being cancelled. You can’t cancel me!” she says.
  Just off a flight from Australia, where she lives part-time with her partner,
  and suffering from “punishing” jet lag along with a recent back injury,
  Margolyes admits that life on the road can be tiring. “I’m gathering my powers
  and I will deliver, but it is a struggle.” Also appearing at Edinburgh this
  year is Linden, a veteran character actor and one of Margolyes’s Harry Potter
  co-stars, who played the horcrux thief Mundungus Fletcher. This year marks the
  40th anniversary of his Edinburgh debut in 1985. Now 71, when Linden last
  performed at the festival in 2022, he suffered a big respiratory attack and
  ended up in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Having been told by his doctor in no
  uncertain terms that “next time it happens I’d need a hearse not an
  ambulance”, Linden is embarking on his first booze- and cigarette-free
  festival as he returns with Baxter vs the Bookies, a show he wrote and
  performs himself, charting the fortunes of an ageing horse-racing tipster
  bamboozled by modern technology. “In the past we gloriously defiled ourselves
  one way or another, but as the years unfold experience takes a hand,” he says
  with some forbearance. “Edinburgh is the Grand National, not a five-furlong
  sprint and whether you’re young or old you’ve got to pace yourself.” Linden’s
  advice for performers of any age is to take a few days off during the run:
  “Edinburgh can be very insular so try to do something a little different, go
  up the coast. I go to the football and watch Hearts or Hibs. Don’t do 30 days
  nonstop.” The festival has changed mightily in scale since he first performed
  here, and has become “fiercely competitive”. But ageism is not a concern for
  Linden: the “brigade of old gits” he is referring to includes Ivor Dembina,
  Stephen Frost, Mark Arden and Mark Thomas. “You don’t retire from the
  profession,” he says, “the profession retires you.” And until that happens, he
  plans to start work in October on a new character project about a boxing
  cornerman. Others are making their debut here. I come to the Assembly Rooms
  bar to meet two women who are sitting poised on high stools. Vivienne Powell,
  76, has just emerged from the first performance of her solo show Diva, about
  an opera singer with dementia battling to reclaim her memories through music.
  Christine Thynne, 82, a retired physiotherapist who took her first dance class
  at 68, is embarking on the first full run of her choreographed performance
  These Mechanisms. It’s a physically challenging dance piece involving
  scaffolding planks and stepladders. Does Thynne rub up against expectations of
  how a woman of her age ought to behave or what she is even capable of? She
  laughs. “At 82, people say: ‘You shouldn’t be going up a stepladder, somebody
  else should be changing the lightbulbs!’” Powell adds: “Our society is pretty
  ageist, in a lot of ways. Older people can be quite dismissed for what they
  can contribute, particularly women. So, to be doing our own shows at the
  fringe at a more mature age is pretty amazing.” Thynne concurs: “When you look
  back over the programmes of past years, I don’t know that there have been many
  elderly women who have done a full show.” Yet the pair remain largely unfazed
  by their own trajectories. “It can be quite common with women”, Powell argues,
  “who don’t come into themselves until their 40s or 50s. And they discover
  talents, interests that they didn’t know they had. They start a whole new
  chapter of their lives.” Having worked as a teacher while raising her three
  children in Sydney, Australia, latterly as a single parent, Powell gave her
  first professional opera recital in her early 40s and later acted on stage, in
  TV and film in Los Angeles. Do Powell and Thynne believe they are braver as
  performers because of their age and experience? “Definitely,” insists Powell.
  “You take more creative risks.” “My piece is completely about creative risks,”
  agrees Thynne. “From the beginning where I’m lying on a scaffolding plank and
  turning over its width. That’s the essence of the creativity, because the
  audience wonder what is going to happen next, then they realise: this isn’t an
  elderly person, this is an exciting piece of work.” There should be no age
  limit to creativity, says Powell. Her advice to those still contemplating
  their next chapter is straightforward: “Follow your heart, do what you love.”
  She raises one finger for emphasis: “And don’t settle.” Thynne says: “Even if
  you’re bringing up children and juggling all these different things and the
  ups and downs of life, still follow your dream. And be very, very positive
  about that!” Both women’s grandchildren will see their shows. Powell reads
  hers a George Eliot quote: “It’s never too late to be what you might have
  been.” • Margolyes and Dickens: More Best Bits is at Pentland theatre at
