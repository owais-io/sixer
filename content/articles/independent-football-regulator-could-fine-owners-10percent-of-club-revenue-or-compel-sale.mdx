  Rogue owners in England and Wales could be fined up to 10% of a club’s revenue
  and even required to sell up under plans set out by the new Independent
  Football Regulator (IFR). The proposals for a new test for owners, directors
  and senior executives are critical to the regulator’s activities in a climate
  in which clubs such as Morecambe and Sheffield Wednesday have experienced
  existential peril. Their intention is to assess the “honesty, integrity and
  financial soundness” of those currently or potentially running a club. They
  have been published for public consultation until 6 October, with the
  intention that the new regime is imposed as soon as possible. The government
  wants to fast-track the regulator’s start so that its powers are activated in
  November. Among the most eye-catching elements is the prospect that, in the
  most serious breaches of July’s Football Governance Act, an owner could be
  fined between 8% and 10% of their club’s revenue from the previous financial
  year. The ability to levy sanctions on individuals, as well as organisations,
  is regarded as a significant pillar of the test. In highly serious cases, the
  IFR will have the power to require an owner to divest from a club. Those
  currently owning clubs will not be required to apply for assessment but have
  been warned that infringements will be viewed dimly. “Good owners, running
  clubs effectively, will experience minimal impact,” a statement from the
  Department for Culture, Media and Sport said. “However, if the IFR has
  concerns about the suitability of an incumbent, it will be able to take
  action.” Under its beefed-up due diligence measures the IFR would also have
  access to banks in order to check where current or prospective owners’ funds
  are held if deemed necessary. It would also be able to consult law enforcement
  agencies and other regulatory bodies. Those behind the plans emphasise that
  they have been designed to promote sound investment rather than discourage
  those seeking to put money into the game. “These powers will be used
  proportionately, in accordance with the IFR’s statutory duties, and with an
  understanding of the importance of owner investment and risk-taking in English
  football,” the statement said.
