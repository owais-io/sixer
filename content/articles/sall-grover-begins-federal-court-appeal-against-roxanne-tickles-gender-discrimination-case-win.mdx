  Giggle for Girls and Sall Grover have begun their appeal to overturn a
  landmark court decision that found the women-only social media app and its CEO
  had unlawfully discriminated against Roxanne Tickle, a transgender woman. On
  Monday, the full court of the federal court in Sydney heard that Grover’s team
  believes the app – designed as a “women-only safe space” – constituted a
  “special measure” under the Sex Discrimination Act (SDA), which allows
  discrimination with the aim of redressing historical disadvantage between men
  and women. In an unexpected move, an application for a new amended notice of
  appeal with an entirely new ground of appeal was lodged by Giggle and Grover’s
  team on Monday morning with only one hour’s notice for Tickle’s legal team.
  The application was refused. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Grover is
  challenging justice Robert Bromwich’s milestone August decision in the first
  gender identity discrimination case to reach the federal court. Tickle, from
  regional New South Wales, sued the women-only social media app for gender
  discrimination, claiming she was unlawfully barred from using Giggle for Girls
  in September 2021 after the firm and Grover said she was a man. Tickle was
  initially allowed to join the app, which shut down in 2022, but was then later
  removed from the platform. She contacted Grover on multiple occasions seeking
  readmission. Tickle was awarded $10,000 plus costs after Bromwich found she
  had been indirectly discriminated against, in the decision that tested the
  meaning and scope of the SDA. The appeal is being heard over four days by
  justice Melissa Perry, justice Geoffrey Kennett and justice Wendy Abraham in
  Sydney. Giggle and Grover’s legal team is being led by Noel Hutley SC. The
  team has dropped its constitutional challenge argument and is appealing
  against paying $10,000 damages, claiming Tickle was not discriminated against
  indirectly, on the basis Grover did not know Tickle was transgender when she
  barred her from the app. Grover previously said that the ruling erred in its
  interpretation of sex under the SDA, had not considered critical evidence and
  did not recognise that the app was a “special measure” fostering substantive
  equality between women and men. Grover has persistently referred to Tickle as
  male and during last year’s hearing, said she would not address her as “Ms”
  Tickle. On Monday, Hutley said a woman was a “natal” woman – or assigned
  female at birth. He told the court the SDA was a “compromise” and that its
  special measures were “ephemeral”, claiming that “just about any special
  measures targeted at a group” would, through the act’s other legal carve-outs,
  probably involve discrimination of another group. He said special measures
  should be protective and enabling, not restrictive. Tickle’s legal team is
  expected to argue that every special measure needs to work for all groups
  protected by the act simultaneously. Tickle’s barrister, Georgina Costello KC
  told the court “a real review of the evidence leads to the easily drawn
  conclusion that, for the purposes of the Sex Discrimination Act, Ms Tickle is
  a woman and she was a woman when the appellants excluded her from the Giggle
  app.” Costello said: “She presented her gender identity to the world and to
  the Giggle app as a woman. Her identity is as a woman and as a transgender
  woman.” She said Bromwich had made the correct conclusion “that Ms Tickle was
  a woman” and that her sex as a woman was “legally unimpeachable”. Tickle’s
  team is expected to argue also that the judge did not fully consider all of
  the evidence and that Tickle’s barring from the app and failure in her appeals
  to Grover to rejoin the app both amounted to direct, not indirect,
  discrimination. Tickle is seeking a total of $40,000: $30,000 in general
  damages, and $10,000 in aggravated damages. Her team will argue previously
  awarded damages of $10,000 are inappropriate and did not take into account
  Grover’s conduct around the proceedings. During the three-day trial in April
  2024, the court heard Tickle had lived as a woman since 2017, has a birth
  certificate stating her gender is female, had gender affirmation surgery and
  “feels in her mind that psychologically she is a woman”. The respondents
  claimed that biological sex was immutable and that the app had been intended
  as an online refuge for women. The court has granted leave to the sex
  discrimination commissioner, Equality Australia and the Lesbian Action Group –
  which unsuccessfully attempted to exclude transgender and bisexual women from
  its public events – to intervene, or participate, in the appeal. Changes to
  the SDA in 2013 made it unlawful under federal law to discriminate against a
  person on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status.
  In April 2025, the UK supreme court issued a historic and definitive ruling
  that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the UK’s Equality Act refer only to a
  biological woman and to biological sex.
