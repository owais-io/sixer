  More than 1,500 civilians may have been massacred during an attack on Sudan’s
  largest displacement camp in April, in what would be the second-biggest war
  crime of the country’s catastrophic conflict. A Guardian investigation into
  the 72-hour attack by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on North
  Darfur’s Zamzam camp, the country’s largest for people displaced by the war,
  found repeated testimony of mass executions and large-scale abductions.
  Hundreds of civilians remain unaccounted for. The magnitude of likely
  casualties means the assault by the RSF ranks only behind a similar ethnic
  slaughter in West Darfur two years ago. The war between the Arab-led RSF and
  Sudanese military, which broke out in April 2023, has been characterised by
  repeated atrocities, forcing millions from their homes and causing the world’s
  largest humanitarian crisis. Until now, reports about the attack on Zamzam
  between 11 and 14 April had indicated that up to 400 non-Arab civilians were
  killed during the three-day assault. The UN has said “hundreds” died. However,
  a committee set up to investigate the death toll has so far “counted” more
  than 1,500 killed in the attack, which occurred on the eve of a British
  government-led conference in London intended to bring peace to Sudan. Mohammed
  Sharif, part of the committee from Zamzam’s former administration, said the
  final total would be significantly higher, with many bodies still not
  recovered from the camp, which is now controlled by the RSF. “Their bodies are
  lying inside homes, in the fields, on roads,” Sharif told the Guardian. An
  atrocity expert with decades of experience in Darfur, who has interviewed
  scores of survivors from Zamzam, believes up to 2,000 people may have been
  killed. Speaking on condition of anonymity, they added that the levels of
  violence were striking even when viewed alongside the genocidal slaughter of
  ethnic African groups in Darfur during the 2000s by the Arab militias who
  would later become the RSF. “Every single testimony from everyone who escaped
  knew family members who were killed. That’s something I’ve never seen before.”
  Abdallah Abugarda, of the UK’s Darfur Diaspora Association, said that about
  4,500 members of his organisation knew a friend or relative killed in the
  attack. At least 2,000 Zamzam residents, he said, remain missing. “The
  massacre at Zamzam, home to displaced people for over 20 years, is one of the
  most heinous crimes in recent global history. Yet no global outrage has
  followed,” added Abugarda. Claire Nicolet, deputy head of emergencies for
  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said the attack had targeted “one of the most
  vulnerable people on earth”. Those who survived, she said, had faced
  “widespread looting, sexual violence and other attacks while on the road and
  appalling living conditions in transit displacement sites”. Large numbers of
  women were abducted and remain missing. Sharif said they knew of more than 20
  who had been taken to Nyala, an RSF stronghold 160km from Zamzam. Last month,
  the International Criminal Court said it had “reasonable grounds” to conclude
  that war crimes and crimes against humanity were unfolding in Darfur. In
  Geneina, West Darfur’s capital, more than 10,000 people – mainly Masalit and
  other non-Arab Sudanese – are believed to have been killed by the RSF and
  allied militias over two months from mid-April 2023. An episode of fighting
  during November that year in a suburb of El Geneina killed more than 800,
  according to the UN. The Sudanese military has also been accused of myriad war
  crimes, in particular the massacre of civilians in indiscriminate bombing
  raids.
