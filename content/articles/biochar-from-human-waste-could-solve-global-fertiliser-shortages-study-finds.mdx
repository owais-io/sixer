  Charcoal made from human waste could help solve fertiliser shortages as well
  as reduce pollution and energy use, a study has found. Biochar is a form of
  charcoal made from organic matter treated at high heat, which is often used on
  farming soil as a fertiliser. The study estimated that biochar made from solid
  human excrement could provide up to 7% of the phosphorus used around the world
  each year. Although the biochar process converts only solids, nutrients taken
  from urine could be added to it, and the researchers found this could provide
  for 15% of annual phosphorus application, 17% of nitrogen, and up to 25% of
  potassium. Treated sewage sludge is already spread on farmland, but its use is
  controversial as it often contains microplastics, heavy metals, Pfas forever
  chemicals, pathogens, and pharmaceuticals.The researchers say biochar can
  avoid this problem by separating the waste at source. The study estimated that
  the biochar process could decrease both the weight and volume of solid
  excrement by up to 90%, which represents a significant gain in efficiency when
  compared with transporting sewage sludge, due to the latter’s high water
  content. The biochar production process also allows nutrient proportions to be
  adjusted according to the needs of individual crops. This can address problems
  associated with fertiliser use such as weed growth and eutrophication – when
  excess nutrients leach into groundwater, causing rapid growth of algae which
  depletes oxygen availability and reduces the sunlight available for underwater
  ecosystems. Dr Johannes Lehmann, a professor of soil biogeochemistry at
  Cornell University and lead author of the study published in the journal PNAS,
  said: “Talking about sewage is not as glamorous as renewable energy, but
  preventing resource wastage by creating a circular economy is also key to the
  green transition.” Agriculture accounts for 25% of global greenhouse gas
  emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As
  demand has increased on global agricultural systems to provide enough food for
  all, so too has its appetite for fertiliser to replenish soil nutrients.
  Synthetic fertilisers deliver three main nutrients to soils – nitrogen,
  potassium, and phosphorus – and all three involve energy-intensive and often
  environmentally destructive production processes. Atmospheric nitrogen is used
  to make ammonia via the Haber process, and turning this into nitrogen
  fertilisers and using these in agriculture emits an estimated 2.6bn tonnes of
  CO2 a year – more than global aviation and shipping combined. Strip mining
  phosphate rock for phosphorus permanently scars natural landscapes and
  processing it into fertiliser also leads to radioactive phosphogypsum as a
  byproduct. Potash mining for potassium contributes to soil salinisation and
  freshwater contamination due to its large amounts of waste salt byproduct.
  According to Lehmann, “the implications [of biochar resource recovery] go
  beyond just agriculture, and involve economics and geopolitics. As finite
  mineral resources become more scarce, countries without significant reserves
  could become dependent on those with for their agricultural needs and food
  security. For example, Morocco holds 70% of the entire world’s reserves of
  phosphates. “Instead, an alternative future where nutrients are recycled
  through a circular economy could empower countries to produce food without
  relying on imported fertilisers, redressing issues of environmental justice
  across the global south by potentially mitigating climate migration, one of
  the main drivers of which is agricultural failure.” • This article was amended
  on 12 August 2025 to clarify that it is not just the production of nitrogen
  fertilisers but their deployment that contributes to their annual CO2
  emissions, and these total around 2.6bn tonnes, not 2.6bn gigatonnes as stated
  in an earlier version. This article was further amended on 28 August 2025 to
  remove the assertion that the process of making biochar removes carbon from
  the atmosphere, making it a useful carbon sink.
