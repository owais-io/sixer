  UK metals companies have threatened to take legal action against the
  government over tariffs on raw steel imports from Asia which they claim have
  caused a “tsunami” of problems for the industry. Earlier this summer, the
  business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, reduced the amount of raw steel from
  Vietnam and South Korea that can be imported tariff-free in a move designed to
  protect UK raw steel makers, which face competition from cheap imports. In a
  letter to Reynolds, a group of manufacturers who use raw steel to make
  industrial products threatened to sue the government after the cut took effect
  in July, leaving shipments already paid for liable to a 25% tariff. Reynolds
  is expected to reply to the letter this week, after asking for more time to
  respond. Manufacturers behind the legal letter said Reynolds gave just 24
  hours’ notice of the quota cut, leaving thousands of tonnes of imported steel
  stranded at UK ports. They said steel already on ships from east Asia had been
  “bought and paid for” but would now attract a tariff on entry to the UK. The
  Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), which represent companies that
  forge, weld and roll raw steel to make industrial products, said its members
  faced a “tsunami” of problems, from higher costs to delayed shipments. It said
  disruptions in deliveries “are reverberating throughout domestic industry”.
  Paul Whitehouse, the managing director of Steel &amp; Alloy Gonvarri
  Industries, based near Birmingham, said he would need to pay more than
  £500,000 in tariff surcharges. Whitehouse said: “The government has shot
  itself in the foot. It wants to help the steel industry, but acting in this
  way, giving just 24 hours’ notice, has only increased our expenses. We work on
  very small margins – 1% to 2% – and these extra costs matter.” The main
  producers of raw steel in the UK are Tata Steel’s operations in south Wales
  and British Steel’s plant in Scunthorpe, which was taken over by the
  government in April after it became concerned that its Chinese owner, Jingye,
  was planning to let its blast furnaces cool. Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), which
  employs 1,500 people and is part of the Liberty Steel Group owned by Sanjeev
  Gupta, is also under threat of closure. UK steel businesses have struggled to
  find domestic buyers after a collapse in demand from longstanding customers.
  Car production has fallen in the UK and activity in the commercial
  construction sector, another large user of steel, has slowed this year. A
  regime of quotas and tariffs already exists, protecting UK raw steel makers
  from cheap Chinese imports and restricting imports from the EU. Pressure has
  mounted since February when many steel-producing countries began seeking new
  markets for their products amid threats by Donald Trump of hefty tariffs on
  imports to the US. Washington’s steel tariffs have also dented UK exports to
  the US. The government said its decision followed a recommendation by the
  Trade Remedies Authority (TRA). However, the metal industry accused Reynolds
  of ignoring changes set out by the independent body. A review by the TRA
  recommended a cap of 40% on tariff-free imports from “other” countries that
  make raw steel, including Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea. But Reynolds
  reduced the cap to 15% and said it would apply the next day. The industry had
  been expecting the new rules to be implemented in October, giving them time to
  find new suppliers. The CBM president, Stephen Morley, said steel was being
  stockpiled at ports “creating a domino effect, with businesses facing
  additional costs, logistical challenges, and uncertainties about the future of
  their operations”. He said his members were in favour of measures safeguarding
  UK steel production, but added that Reynolds had “exacerbated the existing
  pressures on firms already grappling with the aftermath of the current
  economic climate”. Members of the CBM are understood to be clubbing together
  to fund a judicial review of Reynolds’s decision after sending him a
  pre-action protocol letter. A spokesperson for the Department for Business and
  Trade said: “We do not comment on potential or ongoing legal proceedings.”
