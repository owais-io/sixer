  The landslide that triggered a powerful tsunami in Alaska’s Inside Passage
  early on 10 August was a close call, say scientists, tour operators and agency
  officials, with the risk of such events apparently increasing as glaciers
  retreat because of climate change. “It’s a historic event,” said scientist
  Dennis Staley from the US Geological Survey of the slide, which occurred in
  the Tracy Arm fjord 50 miles (80km) south of Juneau. “I feel like we dodged a
  bullet,” he continued, of reports that no one had been hurt, at a destination
  that can see more than 500,000 annual visitors. Staley studies landslide
  hazards in Alaska, including in popular tourism areas. Tracy Arm is a narrow
  30-mile (48km) fjord, with sheer walls looming thousands of feet above the
  water. It ends at the face of the South Sawyer glacier. The dramatic scenery,
  part of the Tongass national forest, attracts kayakers, boaters and a steady
  stream of packed cruise ships. But the channel was apparently empty at 5.30am
  on Sunday, 10 August, when without warning a colossal piece of the fjord wall
  collapsed. Staley says it’s too early to know the precise size of the slide.
  But by analyzing its seismic signal, he and others estimate up to 100m cubic
  meters of rock, or more, fell near the face of the South Sawyer glacier. It
  threw a wave of ocean water an incredible 1,400ft (425 meters) up the opposite
  side of the fjord, which will likely make it one of the largest such waves
  ever recorded. Staley can see its impact on trees and brush in satellite
  imagery and aerial photographs. Seconds later, a tsunami estimated at up to
  100ft (30 meters) tall barreled down the inlet, stripping forest and brush
  from either shore. Thirty miles away, the wave was still 15ft high (5 meters)
  as it swelled up against the remote Harbor Island, coming within inches of a
  tent where Sasha Calvey and two other kayakers were camped. The kayakers
  scrambled awake to find half of their gear had been washed away. One kayak
  hung from a bluff, another was wedged against a tree and a third bobbed in the
  ocean a quarter mile away. The water remained chaotic for hours, says Calvey.
  Although they had to be rescued, ending a 78-day expedition from Washington
  state, Calvey knows they were lucky. If the tsunami had occurred only three
  hours earlier, when the tide level was 10ft higher, they may not have
  survived. Jeffrey and Christine Smith had planned to anchor their 65ft tour
  boat, the David B, for an overnight stay in Tracy Arm. But rainy weather led
  them to anchor about 45 miles away instead. The morning of the slide, they saw
  water rise 10ft along the shore near their anchorage. “We’ve been feeling a
  little mortal,” Christine Smith said after learning how narrowly they missed
  the slide. The landslide occurred just hours before a sightseeing vessel from
  Juneau and a National Geographic tour boat, each with capacity for more than
  100 passengers, were scheduled to visit Tracy Arm. Two cruise ships carrying
  thousands of passengers each had visited the area less than 24 hours earlier.
  Another cruise ship was scheduled for the next day. Staley and others marvel
  at the luck, where poor weather, early morning timing and a falling tide
  apparently conspired to prevent casualties. In another bit of luck, a portion
  of the slide landed on the South Sawyer glacier. If its full weight had hit
  the water, says Staley, the tsunami could have been even larger. But some
  geologists worry that luck may be running out. Landslides near retreating
  glaciers appear to be increasing, in Alaska and elsewhere. One possible cause
  is that glacial ice, which can be hundreds of feet thick, may help support
  mountain walls above them. Scientists debate whether rapid glacial retreat,
  like is happening at Tracy Arm and across the globe, may “de-buttress”
  mountainsides by removing supportive ice that has been in place for centuries.
  Climate change is also thawing high-elevation permafrost around the world.
  When permafrost thaws, explains Staley, changes in pressure, temperature and
  hydrology can cause instability deep within steep slopes . Scientists believe
  thawing permafrost contributed to a massive landslide and glacier collapse
  that wiped out the Swiss village of Blatten earlier this summer. Staley
  emphasizes that it’s too early to say what led to the Tracy Arm slide. “We
  have to be careful,” he says. “We can’t say with any real certainty what
  triggered this event.” Michael West, the state seismologist who directs the
  Alaska Earthquake Center in Fairbanks, agrees it’s too early to identify a
  trigger for the slide, which he calls “shockingly huge”. But he says it’s
  notable that this and other tsunami-causing landslides have occurred near
  retreating glaciers in recent years. He says it’s reasonable to explore the
  ideas of de-buttressing and thawing permafrost in Tracy Arm, along with other
  factors like recent rain in the area. In 2015, a landslide near a receding
  glacier in Taan fiord in south-east Alaska sent water 630ft up a nearby slope.
  A 2024 landslide near the Surprise glacier in Prince William Sound, more than
  500 miles north-west of Tracy Arm, caused a small tsunami. And last summer, a
  large landslide alongside the receding Pedersen glacier in Kenai Fjords
  national park near Seward, Alaska, triggered a wave estimated at 60-180ft.
  Scientists also have a wary eye on a recently discovered weak slope above the
  receding Portage glacier, an hour south-east of Anchorage. If it fails,
  researchers say, it could trigger a tsunami in Portage Lake that could slam
  into a nearby Chugach national forest visitor center that sees up to 1,000
  people daily in summer. They’re also monitoring a 3,000ft unstable slope in
  the Barry Arm inlet in Prince William Sound. If it fails, modeling shows it
  can trigger a tsunami comparable to the one in Tracy Arm. Barry Arm and
  surrounding waters are also popular among boaters, kayakers, cruise ships and
  others. Since the Barry Arm instability was discovered in 2020, scientists
  have installed high tech equipment to track precipitation, slope movement and
  other conditions on the mountain. They hope the work will improve
  understanding of the ties among landslides, glaciers and climate change.
  Although no such instrumentation was present at Tracy Arm, West says that work
  at Barry Arm helped geologists quickly pinpoint the event by analyzing
  real-time data from more than 250 seismic stations around Alaska. “That’s a
  new capability,” says West, explaining that scientists took days to locate the
  2015 Taan fiord slide. But using the new method, they identified the Tracy Arm
  location shortly after calls came in from boats in the area. “But this is
  where it gets wild,” continues West. He says that review of seismic monitoring
  sites shows a seismic “popping” was occurring at the Tracy Arm site for
  roughly 24 hours before the slide, with hundreds of small signals detectable
  100 miles away. They suddenly ended with the slide. “Not every landslide does
  this,” says West, who hopes to research this phenomenon to better understand
  possible warning signals.
