  Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson exacted a measure of revenge by beating Olympic
  champion Noah Lyles over 100m at the Silesia Diamond League meet on Saturday.
  It was the first time the two sprinters have met since Lyles was awarded
  Olympic gold in Paris a year ago, just five-thousandths of a second ahead of
  Thompson. The fast-starting Jamaican timed a joint meet record of 9.87sec for
  victory in the Polish city of Chorzow, with Lyles second in 9.90sec. Another
  American, Kenny Bednarek, rounded out the podium in 9.96sec. “It felt alright.
  My job is to get the job done,” said Thompson. The Jamaican, who missed the
  cut for the 2023 world championships in Budapest, will be one of the
  favourites for this year’s edition in Tokyo on 13-21 September. But he
  downplayed the significance of the result. “Honestly, I compete against
  myself, no offense to the competition,” he said. Lyles put a positive spin on
  his second place, saying it was a “great stepping stone”. “I needed to see a
  sub-10,” the American said. “I needed to see winning, beating people, I took
  out some really big heads today, people who run 9.7 and 9.8. I am getting the
  confidence. It makes me really excited for not only today, but also for next
  week and Tokyo.” Lyles was drawn in lane seven, outside Bednarek and inside
  Christian Coleman, with Thompson in five and South African Akani Simbine to
  his left. But it was Thompson who stole the march in hot and humid conditions,
  rocketing out of his blocks to leave the field in his wake for a true
  gun-to-tape display. Lyles had the joint slowest reaction of the nine-man
  line-up and looked to be out of even a podium finish from the start before he
  came through strongly over the closing 20 metres to pinch second place from
  Bednarek. Thompson’s winning time matched the 9.87sec meet record jointly held
  by Americans Ronnie Baker and Fred Kerley. It did not quite match the
  world-leading 9.75sec he set at the Jamaican trials in June, a time which puts
  him sixth on the all-time list.
