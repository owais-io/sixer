  They are the scourge of the modern commute: passengers who play music or
  videos out loud. But amid widespread disapproval from fellow travellers,
  Transport for London (TfL) is trying to appeal to the better nature of
  “headphone dodgers” by asking them to “be considerate” and plug in. The new
  posters, which will start to appear on the Elizabeth line this week – and on
  other TfL services, including London buses, in the autumn – remind travellers
  to use headphones when listening to music or making calls. “Most people use
  headphones, but even a small number not doing so can create an unpleasant or
  stressful environment,” said Emma Strain, TfL’s customer director. “That’s why
  we’re reminding people to put their headphones on if they don’t already, to
  give others the stress-free journey they’d expect for themselves.” A TfL
  survey of 1,000 people found that 70% described loud music and phone
  conversations without headphones to be a nuisance. The campaign comes as
  mobile coverage spreads across the network, with 4G and 5G now available on
  large sections of the tube and the Elizabeth line. Increased connectivity has
  led to more opportunities to stream content and make calls on the go, but also
  more chances for fellow passengers to be disturbed, TfL said. Seb Dance, the
  deputy mayor for transport, said: “The small majority who play music or videos
  out loud can be a real nuisance to other passengers.” The new posters would
  encourage Londoners “to always be considerate of other passengers”, he added.
  Although the campaign focuses on courtesy, regulations are already in place.
  TfL bylaws ban passengers from singing or playing music out loud anywhere on
  the network, unless they have written permission, such as the licence granted
  to approved buskers. The behaviour can be prosecuted if it causes the
  “annoyance of any person”. In practice, staff usually ask people to turn off
  their speakers. Prosecutions are rare, but not impossible. In 2023, a man was
  fined more than £300 after playing loud music on the Jubilee line. The
  Department for Transport said “strict rules” exist to prevent antisocial
  behaviour on public transport, including fines of up to £1,000. The antisocial
  behaviour is one that has drawn rare support across party lines, with the
  Liberal Democrats branding offenders “headphone dodgers” and Conservative MPs
  calling for tougher enforcement. The Lib Dems have proposed fines and a
  national publicity campaign, while the former shadow transport secretary,
  Gareth Bacon, and other Tories have signalled their backing, emphasising that
  “everyone deserves to travel in peace” and playing loud music chips away at
  public civility.
