  The UK’s first transgender judge has launched a case against the UK in the
  European court of human rights challenging the process that led to the supreme
  court’s ruling on biological sex. The retired judge Victoria McCloud, who is
  now a litigation strategist at W-Legal, is seeking a rehearing of the case,
  arguing that the supreme court undermined her article 6 rights to a fair trial
  when it refused to hear representation from her and did not hear evidence from
  any other trans individuals or groups. The move comes as For Women Scotland,
  the gender-critical campaign group that brought the supreme court case,
  announced it was suing the Scottish government, accusing it of refusing to
  abide by April’s judgment, in particular around schools and prison policy. The
  UK supreme court ruled in April that the legal definition of a woman in the
  Equality Act 2010 did not include transgender women who hold gender
  recognition certificates (GRCs). Subsequent guidance from the equality
  watchdog amounted to a blanket ban on trans people using toilets and other
  services of the gender they identify as. Last year, McCloud sought leave to
  join the litigation in the supreme court case brought by For Women Scotland
  against the Scottish government, arguing it could significantly affect legal
  protections for transgender women with GRCs, but the application was rejected.
  The court took interventions from a number of gender-critical groups including
  Sex Matters and a group of three campaigning organisations comprising LGB
  Alliance, The Lesbian Project and Scottish Lesbians. McCloud, who is supported
  by Trans Legal Clinic and W-Legal, said the application was brought under
  articles 6, 8 and 14 of the European convention on human rights, “essentially
  the rights to respect for who I am, my family, my human existence, my right to
  a fair trial in matters determining my own freedoms and obligations without
  discrimination. “No representation or evidence had been included from us in
  the 8,500 group [the estimated UK population of people with GRCs who are
  diagnosed as transsexual]. I was refused. The court gave no reasoning. “The
  court reversed my and 8,500 other people’s sex for the whole of equality law …
  We are now two sexes at once. We are told we must use dangerous spaces such as
  male changing rooms and loos when we have female anatomy. If we are raped we
  must go to male rape crisis. We are searched by male police, to ‘protect’
  female police from, I assume, our female anatomy.” April’s ruling has
  wide-ranging implications for service providers, public bodies and businesses,
  with most awaiting an updated code of practice for public bodies from the
  equalities watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission. This has
  attracted criticism from leading charities and services providers over the
  brevity of its consultation period. Elsewhere, For Women Scotland and Sex
  Matters have criticised the Scottish government for failing to implement the
  supreme court ruling swiftly enough, citing “extraordinary pushback” against
  the judgment. The Scottish government has repeatedly stated it is awaiting the
  updated EHRC code, but the Sunday Times reported that For Women Scotland had
  applied to the court of session for permission to proceed with an action that,
  if successful, would quash schools guidance that states trans pupils can use
  toilet and changing facilities that align with their lived gender, and prisons
  policy that continues to allow some trans women to be housed in the female
  estate, based on risk assessment. According to sources with knowledge of the
  process, the revised code is expected to be delivered to the equalities
  minister, Bridget Phillipson, this week. After she has approved it, the new
  code will be laid before parliament for 40 days, as happens with most
  statutory instruments, during which time MPs or peers may pass a motion to
  prevent it from having legal effect, although in practice such intervention
  happens rarely. Earlier this month the EHRC chief executive, John Kirkpatrick,
  took the unusual step of posting a blog in response to critical media reports,
  rejecting allegations that the commission was dragging its feet and defending
  the use of AI to assess consultation responses. “Our use of supervised AI
  technology alongside expert legal analysis is a responsible and widely used
  approach that ensures we can give proper consideration to all responses while
  delivering the guidance that public bodies urgently need,” he said. • This
  article was amended on 18 August 2025 An earlier version misnamed John
  Kirkpatrick as John “Fitzpatrick”. A further amendment was made on 19 August
  2025 to correct that most statutory instruments are laid before parliament for
  40 days, not all of them.
