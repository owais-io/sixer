  Emmanuel Sonubi has always hidden behind how he looks: beefy, intimidating by
  choice, shrink-wrapped in skinny jeans. But now he’s stepping out from behind
  that image, he tells us – and appearing in his glasses for the first time, as
  if to prove it. So is this a change in direction for Sonubi, a revealing of
  the true Emmanuel behind the ex-bouncer shtick? Yes and no. There’s more
  bounce to his comedy in Life After Near Death, some cheeky-chappy smugness
  about his success, his manner not quite so smooth and sonorous as before.
  There are flashes of a greater intimacy too, as our host addresses some grave
  personal matters. But the show goes only so far in that direction, and no
  further. One of the matters in question is the heart failure Sonubi suffered
  onstage six years ago, and the mini-stroke it triggered. Another is the shame
  he carried from his troubled childhood, which he suppressed with a hedonistic
  lifestyle – until his body dramatically resisted. Sonubi outlines all this
  with a lightness of touch you might admire as skilful, regret as superficial –
  or accept as both. The Londoner does speak forthrightly about his bygone
  drink-and-drugs lifestyle, and later about his beloved mum’s cancer diagnosis,
  but never for long before swerving back to some first-base comedy about “I
  fucked your mum”, or rude words in BSL, or “I kicked that kid like a fucking
  penalty.” The latter line comes from a routine about disliking his youngest
  child, and recalls similar material in his 2022 debut Emancipated. It’s
  characteristic of a show that critiques machismo, but isn’t above deploying it
  for easy laughs. Not all the laughs are easy, mind you: Sonubi is such a warm
  and charismatic performer, he can carve comedy out of inauspicious material,
  too – see a risque line about the slave trade that draws gasps from the crowd.
  More often, his standup content stays fairly unadventurous, with the personal
  stuff, while seemingly heartfelt, digging only so deep as to excavate
  conventional conclusions about carpe diem and every day’s a blessing. I left
  feeling that the man-behind-the-mask promise had been only partly fulfilled.
