  More than 450 people have been arrested in central London at the largest
  demonstration relating to Palestine Action since the group was proscribed as a
  terrorist organisation. On Saturday night, the Metropolitan police said:
  “Parliament Square and Whitehall are clear. As of 9pm, 466 people had been
  arrested for showing support for Palestine Action. “There were a further eight
  arrests for other offences including five assaults on officers.” The Met said
  the total of 474 was the most arrests it had made related to a single
  operation in at least the past decade. Before the planned event in the
  capital, the Met said it had drawn officers from other forces to help form a
  “significant policing presence”. It was anticipated the event would result in
  large numbers of people being detained. By Saturday afternoon, hundreds of
  people had gathered in Parliament Square for a demonstration organised by the
  campaign group Defend Our Juries, who said “approximately 1,000 sign-holders”
  had turned up. The Met said it estimated 500-600 people were in Parliament
  Square when the demonstration began, but “many” were not taking part. A
  spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said earlier: “The fact that unprecedented
  numbers came out today risking arrest and possible imprisonment shows how
  repulsed and ashamed people are about our government’s ongoing complicity in a
  livestreamed genocide, and the lengths people are prepared to go to defend
  this country’s ancient liberties.” “The police have only been able to arrest a
  fraction of those supposedly committing ‘terrorism’ offences, and most of
  those have been given street bail and allowed to go home. This is a major
  embarrassment to Yvette Cooper, further undermining the credibility of this
  widely ridiculed law.” On Saturday evening, the home secretary thanked
  officers and reaffirmed the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action.
  “Many people may not yet know the reality of this organisation, but the
  assessments are very clear – this is not a nonviolent organisation. UK
  national security and public safety must always be our top priority,” Cooper
  said. The demonstration began at 1pm but officers made a small number of
  arrests beforehand. Soon after, officers began arresting people outside the
  green holding signs that referenced Palestine Action. One woman, while being
  dragged away by police, said: “All of you have loved ones, you’re arresting
  the wrong people. Arrest the people over there [pointing towards parliament],
  arrest the people complicit in the genocide.” From 1pm to 2pm, demonstrators
  holding signs that read “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” were
  silent. “It’s all very sedate, peaceful and moving,” said Suzan Broom, who
  clapped and cheered for those being taken away by police. “I’ve been following
  them and saying thank you because I’m too scared.” Two women taking part in
  the action, one in her mid-70s, were arrested by police midway through their
  interview with the Guardian. One said of the turnout: “I think it’s great,
  people are absolutely sick of seeing genocide on their screens.” She said the
  vandalism of RAF aircrafts by Palestine Action members was a “protest action,
  it’s not at all terrorism”. “Those planes are the terrorists. They’re going
  over and shooting and killing children,” she said. Zoe, one of those taking
  part in the demonstration, said: “I along with hundreds of ordinary people
  have had enough of our government’s collusion in genocide. “You can hear the
  claps and it’s got like a family-friendly environment here. You’ve seen it
  with your own eyes. It’s completely peaceful and there’s nothing vaguely
  terrorist right now. We’re just being ordinary peaceful people saying we
  oppose genocide,” she said. She wore a large patch with the words “Jews
  Against Genocide”. She said: “I wear it clearly and with pride to make sure
  that other people recognise that there are many many Jews who do not support
  genocide of any nature.” “I’m holding a piece of paper for goodness sakes,
  that’s not a terrorist act. A terrorist act is intentionally starving 2
  million,” she said. “I don’t know what to say to [Palestinians], I’m so sorry
  it’s come to this. I wish we could do more but we’re trying our best.”
  Officers searched the bags of those arrested. In one backpack handled with
  blue forensic gloves, they uncovered some bread and a milk carton filled with
  water. Robert Del Naja, from the band Massive Attack, joined the sign-holders
  and said: “UK civil liberties are trapped in a manufactured crisis. Peaceful
  citizens of conscience – including pensioners – have become terrorists, at the
  will of a human rights lawyer turned authoritarian who now lunges at opinions
  that expose the moral vacuum of his unrecognisable government.” Some of those
  arrested were publicly processed on the street outside Scotland Yard, near the
  main demonstration, where crowds gathered and shouted “‘shame on you” at
  officers. Amnesty International called the mass arrests “deeply concerning”.
  “The protesters in Parliament Square were not inciting violence and it is
  entirely disproportionate to the point of absurdity to be treating them as
  terrorists,” said Sacha Deshmukh, the organisation’s chief executive. “We have
  long criticised UK terrorism law for being excessively broad and vaguely
  worded and a threat to freedom of expression. These arrests demonstrate that
  our concerns were justified.” Before the protest, a Home Office spokesperson
  said: “The home secretary has been clear that the proscription of Palestine
  Action is not about Palestine, nor does it affect the freedom to protest on
  Palestinian rights. “It only applies to the specific and narrow organisation
  whose activities do not reflect or represent the thousands of people across
  the country who continue to exercise their fundamental rights to protest on
  different issues. Freedom to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and we
  protect it fiercely.” The first three people to be charged with supporting the
  group in England and Wales were named on Thursday. Jeremy Shippam, 71, Judit
  Murray, 71, and Fiona Maclean, 53, have been charged with displaying an
  article in a public place, arousing reasonable suspicion that they are a
  supporter of a proscribed organisation after their attendance at a previous
  demonstration last month. Palestine Action was banned in June, days after
  activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and defaced two military
  aircraft with spray paint. The ban means that membership of, or support for,
  Palestine Action is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison
  under the Terrorism Act 2000. In a separate development, the government
  announced on Saturday it would send an additional £8.5m of aid to Gaza via a
  UN agency, a day after Keir Starmer said Israel’s expansion plans were “wrong”
  and “will only bring more bloodshed”.
