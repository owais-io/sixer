  The Guardian view on Conservative asylum policy: the moderate Tory tradition

  The traditional test of effectiveness in a leader of the opposition is whether
  the holder of that office looks like a prime minister in waiting. It is
  famously hard to achieve when fronting a party that was recently expelled from
  office. Kemi Badenoch is struggling with that challenge in most areas, but
  especially with regard to immigration and asylum. Mrs Badenoch has warned that
  “Britain is being mugged” by foreigners who treat the country as “the world’s
  softest touch”. She has urged Conservative-run local authorities to follow the
  example of Epping council, which this week was granted an injunction by the
  high court to prevent asylum seekers being housed in hotels. On that point she
  had already been upstaged by Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, who
  joined protests at the hotel in question, mingling in a crowd alongside
  notorious far-right activists. Rival parties have been quick to point out that
  the Conservatives’ appalling record of managing the asylum system in general,
  and the accommodation question in particular, disqualifies them from
  commenting on the subject. Nigel Farage has called Mr Jenrick a “fraud” on the
  grounds that he was the responsible minister in September 2023, when the
  number of asylum claimants housed in hotels peaked at 56,042. Official figures
  released on Thursday show that that number was down to 32,059 at the end of
  June this year – lower than in March but higher than a year ago. Labour
  insists that it is bringing the situation under control, noting that the
  backlog of asylum cases is falling. Over time, that should ease pressure for
  temporary accommodation. But the government struggles to make a case for
  patience and incremental change when the terms of debate are framed by
  opportunists and demagogues waging a campaign of social division. There is
  little space for a rational conversation about fair asylum processes when
  prominent politicians depict all claimants as criminals and cast the entire
  system as a conspiracy to transfer public resources from native-born Britons
  to undeserving foreign interlopers. Those paranoid, xenophobic assumptions are
  not new, but their capture of mainstream politics has accelerated recently. In
  part, that expresses the cowardice of a Labour government that projects more
  anxiety about Britain somehow becoming an “island of strangers” than it does
  for the systemic corrosion of refugee rights. But it is also a symptom of
  moral collapse in a Conservative party that finds its function as the official
  opposition eclipsed by Reform UK, with Mr Farage playing the role of prime
  minister in waiting. Mrs Badenoch looks intellectually and strategically
  paralysed by her predicament. She claims not to make common cause with Reform
  while refusing to articulate any ideological distinction between the two
  parties. Mr Jenrick openly manoeuvres to replace her as leader and, in the
  process, erases any remaining distinction between traditional Conservatism and
  radical anti-immigrant nationalism. A party that was once a broad church is
  folding itself up into a narrow hardline sect. Mr Jenrick’s defeat in last
  year’s leadership contest suggests that there is – or was then – a substantial
  portion of the party that mistrusts his agenda. Some MPs may even be appalled
  by his antics. If so, the time to speak up is long overdue. Otherwise their
  continued silence can be taken as acquiescence in the total extinction of
  moderate Conservatism as a force in British politics. Do you have an opinion
