  Search Engine: Notes from the North Korean-Chinese-Russian Border By which a
  strip of land became a hole in time – Durs Grünbein Grandfather I cannot find,
  flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, what country do you belong to: where is
  your body buried, where did your soul go when the road led nowhere?
  Grandfather I’ll never know, the moment father last saw you opens a wormhole
  that has no end: the hours became years, the years forever: and on the other
  side lies a memory of a memory or a dream of a dream of a dream of another
  life, where what happened never happened, what cannot come true comes true:
  and neither erases the other, or the other others, world after world, to
  infinity – If only I could cross the border and find you there, find you
  anywhere, as if you could tell me who he is, or was, or might have become: no
  bloodshot eyes, or broken bottles, or praying with cracked lips because the
  past is past and was is not is – Grandfather, stranger, give me back my father
  – or not back, not back, give me the father I might have had: there, in the
  country that no longer exists, on the other side of the war – This week marks
  a return-visit to the work of the award-winning Korean-American-British poet
  and playwright Suji Kwock Kim. It’s from her pamphlet Notes from the North,
  published by Smith/Doorstop in 2022, and was a 2019 winner of its annual
  International Book and Pamphlet competition. Focused on the violent
  disruptions experienced by the poet’s family members during the Korean war and
  subsequent North Korean dictatorship, the collection was described by Amy
  Wack, one of the competition judges, as “a scorched family album, rescued from
  the ruin”. Search Engine is an invocation to the poet’s grandfather, circling
  round a series of three apostrophes that suggest the intensifying fact of his
  absence: “Grandfather I cannot find”, “Grandfather I’ll never know” and
  “Grandfather, stranger”. That the voice in its fruitless search reverberates
  over much of human history, 20th century history in particular, is signalled
  by the epigraph. In the East German poet Durs Grünbein’s Portrait of the
  Artist as a Young Border Dog, the dog remembers the now-invisible border and
  the “strip of land” he once guarded: “Watchtowers are forgetful, / Like eyes
  which have been torn from their sockets. / Gone already: the separating
  place’s / Two or three names. // The trick’s now unbetrayed / which made a
  strip of land a hole in time. / I’m glad my brow does not reveal a thing.”
  Kim’s triplet stanza gives a sense of the circularity of the
  search-within-a-search enforced by the “hole in time”. For her, the hole is a
  wormhole. In her quest for the specificity she needs to flesh out the truth of
  her past, the searcher asks her grandfather: “what country do you belong to:
  // where is your body buried, / where did your soul go / when the road led
  nowhere?” Why these questions are urgent is explained in the preceding poem,
  Searchlight. The grandfather leaves his 10-year-old son (the poet’s future
  father) in a forest in North Korea’s far north, “whispering Wait in the woods
  until I come back.” But the boy’s father doesn’t return, ever. The poem
  evolves into a series of agonised questions as to why the abandoned son hasn’t
  tried to find him. The searchlight’s brightest illumination is saved for the
  questioner’s final sharp pang of insight: “Is it better not to know what
  happened, as if the not-knowing could keep him alive?” While the “searchlight”
  has become a “search engine” in the current poem, the wormhole of infinite
  connections flows on: it “has no end”, as time, for the child, waiting in the
  woods for his father to return, would have seemed to have no end. There is
  still a border between now and the past, and “on the other side // lies a
  memory of a memory / or a dream of a dream of a dream / of another life …” The
  puzzle of alternative possibilities is interrupted in the ninth stanza by the
  device of making the challenged reality so harshly present it shoulders all
  alternative dreaming aside: “no bloodshot eyes, or broken / bottles, or
  praying with cracked lips / because the past is past and was is not is – ” But
  again, there’s a feeling of circularity in the shifts of consciousness
  suggested, between drunkenness and thirst, or sleeplessness and prayer.
  Scrupulously precise, despite her passion, the speaker utters her last plea
  (“Grandfather, stranger, / give me back my father –”) and instantly checks
  herself, “or not back, not back, give me the father // I might have had …” In
  the search engine of the poem, complexity of thought always coexists with
  openly expressed emotion. The title metaphor implies that the desire for
  answers could, should, be matched by the availability and interconnectivity of
  facts; if it’s not, the drive to go on seeking answers in the absence of
  connection can be relentless. Physics can’t help the recovery of the lost
  “flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone …” Time can’t be reversed, and the search
  is abandoned unfinished, “there, in the country that no longer exists, / on
  the other side of the war –” Kim writes, “There are an estimated 10 million
  separated families (이산가족) divided between North and South Korea, including my
  own.” For additional context, her short essay, no end / to the end, is
  essential reading.
