  Why is it that, in all of the recent discussion of oral literacy (Letters, 30
  July; Editorial, 27 July; Simon Jenkins, 24 July), there appears to be no
  mention of the one subject that already exists that has speaking and listening
  at its very heart: drama? Of course, discussion, debates, rehearsed readings –
  all of the things that advocates of oral literacy cite – are vital. And all
  are embedded within the drama curriculum. Debates don’t have to be formal;
  watch a group of children negotiate how to form and shape a piece of drama,
  and you see vivid debate in action. Rehearsed readings? Surely rehearsed
  performance is better. So why this apparent dismissal? Perhaps it is distrust
  of the creative imagination that drama has as its very basis. Or the focus
  that the subject also has on movement as another vital tool of communication?
  Or is it a distaste for the apparent unruliness of the drama studio, where
  children do not sit in rows (other teachers dread covering for drama, in case
  they are required to oversee such chaos)? Of course, the debating chamber has
  its place. But what is for most children their most common oral experience,
  and frequently their most abiding memory? Performing in the school play,
  whether that be the infant nativity play or Shakespeare or some other
  challenging text. By all means, encourage oracy in the classroom. But don’t
  forget the drama studio or the school stage. Chris Walters Little Ickford,
  Buckinghamshire • I would go further back than school to develop oracy in
  children. How sad to see so many parents pushing their children in buggies, or
  even carrying them in slings, but glued to their phones instead of engaging
  with them. Even from birth, it is so important to interact with the young
  child. Jeanette Hamilton Buxton, Derbyshire • Have an opinion on anything
