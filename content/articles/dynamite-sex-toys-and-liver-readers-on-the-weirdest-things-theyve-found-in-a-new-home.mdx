  ‘When I opened the suitcase, I fell backwards and screamed’ Our new house had
  once been the home of a ferry boat captain and his family. The previous owners
  requested that we dispose of anything left behind. “We’re going to find a
  body,” I told my husband as we considered the piles and piles of things in the
  den, the garage and the attic. It took a year of remodelling the house before
  I finally got around to sorting through the sheds. There was a lot of rotting
  junk: mouse-eaten baseball caps, a wooden bat, old cassette tapes and a very
  large suitcase. When I opened the suitcase, I fell backwards and screamed. My
  husband and neighbour came running up the driveway. It was a body in two
  parts: a full head of hair, arms, hands and a torso in one half; legs and feet
  in track pants and sneakers in the other. Both halves wore an Adidas
  tracksuit. We peered inside to get a better look. She was a full-size
  resuscitation doll, probably used to train ferry personnel in first aid and
  rescue. My husband looked at me, his mouth wide open and his eyebrows raised.
  “I told you so,” I said. BL, Washington, US ‘They were perfectly, disgustingly
  beautiful’ I moved into the house in 2006, but it took me almost 10 years to
  venture properly into our loft. It had been partly floored already, but I
  needed to finish the job to create an arts studio for my studies. The loft was
  completely empty, or so I thought. After poking about, I found a carrier bag
  wedged in the roof. Inside were about 10 pairs of old, worn-out, 1970s-style
  Y-fronts. The discovery amused and disgusted me. One pair had a logo that said
  “Half Way Inn”; another, in white, had a grubby brown colour on the front. I
  kept the four best pairs and put them on display in the studio. The pants
  would be horrible to most people, but they fascinated me and made me laugh.
  They were perfectly, disgustingly beautiful. A couple of years after the
  discovery, I started dating. My boyfriend did not understand my fascination
  with the pants – he is the opposite of me and very conventional. When we
  decided to move in together, he strongly made the point that I wasn’t allowed
  to bring them. It was him or the pants. I did consider hiding them. Oonagh,
  Angus, UK ‘Our discovery explained the guilt-ridden prayer-meeting notes’ My
  husband and I bought a property a few years ago from a couple. When we first
  visited the home, the wife was wearing an unmissable gold cross. She took
  charge of the viewing while her husband seemed relegated to the garage. After
  the couple moved out, we found a Bible sitting on an out‑of-the-way shelf in
  the garage. I flicked through it and found a folded sheet of paper with
  details of a prayer meeting. It belonged to the husband of the cross-clad
  former owner of the house. Written on the sheet of paper were the words: “Why
  I am at this prayer meeting today,” to which he had scribbled the response:
  “Because I always feel guilty.” Some months later, we noticed a blackbird
  flying in and out of the garage. It was building a nest and we wanted to see
  whether eggs had been laid. My partner went inside and climbed up a ladder.
  They had nested in a hard-to-reach corner. Next to the nest sat a smartphone.
  After we charged the phone up and switched it on, a ransomware notice flashed
  up, naming the prayer-meeting husband as the owner of the phone. Being fairly
  tech-savvy, it didn’t take too much effort to remove the ransom notice – and
  we were presented with a browser page dedicated to hirsute elderly women,
  featuring a dozen or so photos of ladies enjoying themselves. This appeared to
  explain his guilt-ridden prayer‑meeting notes. Anonymous ‘Two weeks after the
  dog ate the mystery meat, my mum got a phone call’ When I was in my 20s, with
  a newborn, I moved back to a flat my mum owned. She had rented it out to
  another woman who had recently given birth. They only lived there for six
  months, but they had made their mark on the place: their dogs had eaten the
  cushions off the sofa; it was a real mess. While cleaning, I found a carrier
  bag in the freezer that looked like a lump of liver. I’m a vegetarian, so I
  don’t know what different cuts of meat look like. We had a dog, so we put the
  mystery meat outside in the back garden and he ate it. We didn’t think
  anything of it, then two weeks later my mum got a phone call. It was the
  previous tenant, who said she had accidentally left her placenta behind and
  asked for it back. Mum didn’t tell her the dog ate it – she said it had been
  thrown away. You wouldn’t expect such an important thing to be left behind in
  the freezer … Melissa, Pembrokeshire, UK ‘I’m so glad I had cleaning gloves
  on’ In 1986, I bought my first flat. While clearing out the fitted wardrobes
  that came with it, I found a loose carrier bag tucked underneath a drawer. I
  opened it up and inside was an item that I thought looked like a man’s willy.
  I was right. On further inspection, I realised it was a used, battery-operated
  vibrator. I’m so glad I had cleaning gloves on. My elderly mum was with me
  when I discovered the bag. I said: “Oh, that can go in the bin.” Unaware of
  its contents, my mum replied: “She probably doesn’t realise she’s left that
  and might want it back. You should ring her.” After some back and forth, I
  showed her my discovery. She looked for a minute and then said: “Oh good God!
  Your father can take it to the tip.” I shoved it into a black bag with lots of
  other things that needed to go. Dad never knew what was inside. Sally,
  Wiltshire, UK ‘I had never handled explosives before’ I moved into an old
  farmhouse with my wife and her daughter in the early 1970s. The previous owner
  lost his temper a lot in our dealings with him; if we said something he didn’t
  like, he would raise his voice and put his fist up in the air. He frightened
  the wits out of my solicitor and I kept my contact with him as low as
  possible. When we moved into the house, he still had his animals and
  possessions in the outbuildings. When he finally took his stuff with him, I
  had a look around. In the dark corner of a room, lit by a single naked bulb, I
  found an old cardboard box labelled Nobel – the name of an explosives
  manufacturer with a factory nearby. I was pretty sure what I was going to find
  when I opened it. The box contained three or four sticks of explosives and
  detonators that looked brand new. I had never handled explosives before, so I
  phoned the police. It took them three hours to find me. When they arrived, I
  showed them what I had found and they said: “Oh yes, those are explosives,”
  and off they went. The next day, the bomb-disposal squad arrived, in a Morris
  Traveller, of all things, to remove the items. One of them returned from the
  outbuilding with the box and a broad smile on his face. I found out later that
  the explosives had started to become unstable; they would have gone off with a
  nasty bang if they had detonated. Alan, Wales, UK ‘I left it out for the bin
  men, but I was worried they might think it was mine’ In 1996, I moved into a
  house with my daughter. The previous owners, a couple with two children, were
  portly and eccentric. They left in such a rush that some things were
  forgotten. While cleaning out a cupboard in the master bedroom, I found a
  surprising item lodged on a top shelf: a flesh-coloured rubber sex suit made
  for two people. It was stuffed into its original packaging – after, I assume,
  being taken for a test run; it didn’t look pristine. It was a very odd sex
  item. It had instructions on the front on how to rub your bits together.
  Vibrators are one thing; full-body sex suits are another. Given their plump
  stature, I wasn’t sure how they would have got into it, never mind out of it.
  It certainly would have restricted blood supply. I left it out for the bin
  men, but I was worried they might think it was mine. They’re always asking for
  a tip, but who knows why. Maybe they’re after some hush money. NT, London, UK
  ‘I laughed out loud with surprise and a kind of horror’ Twenty years ago, I
  bought a charming home, but the inside was a neglected mess. I soon found
  myself on my knees in the bathroom, washing around the back of the toilet,
  when I encountered a small, crumpled package tucked out of sight. It was a
  handkerchief tied around something. My heart thumped wildly. Could they be
  jewels? Sadly not. I unfolded it and gasped to see five long, yellowy-brown
  teeth filled heavily with gold. I laughed out loud with surprise and a kind of
  horror. The estate agent gave me a forwarding address, so I wrote a note to
  the previous owners telling them of my find, but I never received a reply. I
  popped the teeth into a glass jar, thinking one day I would do something with
  them. I later sold the home and moved out of town. While at my local shopping
  centre, I saw a stall buying gold. I knew what I could sell. I tumbled the
  teeth on to the counter. The girl behind the till wasn’t fazed; she’d seen it
  all before. “Are they your father’s teeth?” she asked. “God, no,” I said,
  shocked at the suggestion. She got out some heavy-duty pliers and began
  crushing the teeth to separate the gold from the enamel. She put the nuggets
  on the scales and offered me A$60 for the lot. I quickly refused, as that
  seemed like a real rip-off. Years later, the remains of the golden teeth are
  still in that glass jar. Silda, Sydney, Australia ‘The pennies weren’t so much
  a goodwill wish as an attempt at poltergeist protection’ I was ecstatic when
  my family and I moved to an old Victorian-era house on Long Island. After
  moving in, I noticed that the previous owners had left pennies on all the
  window sashes. I had no idea what it meant, but since they were nice people, I
  figured it was a gesture of goodwill on their part, representing good wishes
  for our future in the house. Several years later, as I was getting ready for
  bed, I heard a cacophonous racket in the attic above – the noise of someone
  stomping up and down and throwing boxes and furniture around. I sent my
  husband up to see what was going on and he found nothing: no one there; not a
  single item out of place. At that point, the word “poltergeist” popped into my
  mind. I’m not afraid of ghosts; I was charmed by the thought that we were
  sharing our new (old) house with one. Now, I think the pennies weren’t so much
  a goodwill wish as an attempt at poltergeist protection. It’s still a mystery
  to me. Nancy, New York, US • The contributors featured in this article
