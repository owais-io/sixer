  Linda May Han Oh: Strange Heavens review | John Fordham's jazz album of the
  month

bodyText: >-
  The power of three has had a great press for a long time, embedded as it’s
  been in the tenets of Christians, witches, Buddhists, or just the beginnings,
  middles and ends of fireside stories. And in the thrifty music-making years
  after the second world war, the economical appeal of the jazz trio – often led
  by piano virtuosi such as Bill Evans or Ahmad Jamal, occasionally by such sax
  giants as Sonny Rollins – also revealed just how much spontaneous creativity
  could fly from minimal gatherings. Linda May Han Oh, the Malaysia-born, New
  York-based Australian bassist and composer whose star employers have included
  Vijay Iyer and Pat Metheny, leads this standout example, composing everything
  except for covers of Geri Allen and Melba Liston tunes. Her trio partners are
  those stellar inventors of contemporary jazz, Ambrose Akinmusire (trumpet) and
  Tyshawn Sorey (drums). Akinmusire, a master of soft-blown sonic ambience and
  Miles-inspired urgency, initially edges his way tremulously into Oh’s racing
  bass hook on the opening Portal as if retracing distantly remembered paths
  with her (they first collaborated on Oh’s 2009 trio-leadership debut, Entry),
  before hurtling into dizzying top-end squeals, skimming double-time lines, and
  half-valve note-bends. The title track’s whispering, short-phrase melody
  blossoms amid Oh’s caressing pizzicato and Sorey’s spacey rimshots; Acapella’s
  delicately descending passages are embraced by bass flurries and hissing
  cymbals; and Akinmusire is in his most rhythmically Miles-inspired on the
  staccato, hip-hoppish Noise Machinery. The guilelessly delicate Paperbirds is
  a highlight, as is the soaringly rhapsodic Folk Song. Allen’s Skin is edgy,
  brittle and eventually free-jazzily wild, and Liston’s meditative Just Waiting
  glows with the compelling tonal warmth of both Akinmusire’s horn and Oh’s
  sonorities. The title Strange Heavens unerringly nails this music. Also out
  this month Unavailable except as used vinyl since 1973, Original (Cadillac) is
  an improv duet between quixotic British alto saxophonist Mike Osborne and the
  unique Monk/Ellington-inspired pianist/composer and éminence grise Stan
  Tracey. Osborne was a gifted juggler of lilting lyricism and spine-tingling
  Eric Dolphy-esque intensity, and Tracey a powerhouse of joltingly dissonant
  rhythmic propulsion, pushed to the spontaneous edge on this 1972 live
  recording. French accordionist Vincent Peirani’s Living Being IV: Time
  Reflections (Act) features this eclectic virtuoso in a genre-fluid quartet
  with saxophone partner Émile Parisien on an elegant fusion of Fender Rhodes
  piano grooving, booming basslines, rich hymnal melodies, 16th-century
  polyphonic ideas, a tribute to German piano virtuoso Michael Wollny, and a lot
  more. And the prize-winning UK vocalist Emma Smith’s Bitter Orange (La
  Reserve) vivaciously confirms that her turn-on-a-dime timing, shrewdly subtle
  originals, and standard-song empathy make her a mainstreamer in a class of her
  own.
