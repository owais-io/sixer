  Fenerbahce are in talks with Nottingham Forest over a deal to sell Dominik
  Livakovic to the Premier League club. Nuno Espírito Santo is insistent Forest
  need to sign a new goalkeeper before the end of the window to challenge first
  choice Matz Sels and the arrival of the Croatian would appease the head coach.
  Angus Gunn joined on a free transfer after leaving Norwich but last season’s
  understudies Carlos Miguel and Wayne Hennessey have moved on. The Brazilian
  returned to his homeland to join Palmeiras after a season in the Premier
  League, while the former Wales international retired and joined the club’s
  coaching staff. Nuno has openly criticised the club’s transfer business but
  work is going on in the background to supply the head coach with everything he
  wants. The club are also in the market for two new full-backs, with Matty Cash
  a key target, before the window closes on 1 September. Livaković is an
  experienced goalkeeper who has 66 caps for Croatian and has spent the past two
  seasons in the Turkish Super Lig with Fenerbahce where he was their No 1 until
  the start of the campaign and will be allowed to leave Istanbul for the right
  amount. The 30-year-old is yet to start a game this season as José Mourinho
  has preferred İrfan Can Eğribayat in Champions League qualifiers and domestic
  matches. Previous Premier League interest in Livakovic has come from Tottenham
  and Manchester United and the Croatian is eager to test himself in England. He
  was carefully monitored during the 2022 World Cup when he helped Croatia
  finish third in the tournament, including a match-winning performance in the
  quarter-final shootout victory over Brazil. If Forest were able to complete a
  deal for Livakovic, it would become the club’s ninth signing of the summer.
  Forest have already spent £140m to aquire Igor Jesus, Dan Ndoye, Omari
  Hutchinson, James McAtee, Jair Cunha and Arnaud Kalimuendo, while Gunn joined
  for nothing and Douglas Luiz is on loan from Juventus.
