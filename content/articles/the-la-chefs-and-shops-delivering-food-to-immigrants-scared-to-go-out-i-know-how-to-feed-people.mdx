  When Danielle Duran Zecca saw military-style immigration raids and people
  being snatched off the streets and put into unmarked vehicles in her native
  Los Angeles earlier this summer, she was in disbelief. “It just felt unreal
  like this wasn’t a world that we could be living in right now,” said Duran
  Zecca, a James Beard Award nominated chef and co-owner of Amiga Amore in
  Highland Park, a historically Latino neighborhood in north-east LA. “I didn’t
  know what to do, but I knew how to feed people and love on people because that
  is exactly how I was brought up in my family.” When several of Duran Zecca’s
  workers expressed fear about coming into the restaurant, the chef had a
  realization. “If they didn’t want to leave their homes, how many others were
  like this and how many weren’t eating,” she said. Earlier in the year, Amiga
  Amore received donations that allowed the Mexican-Italian restaurant to give
  meals away to those affected by the LA wildfires, but this time she would need
  a different approach, one that made people feel safe. So Duran Zecca began
  personally delivering free meals to 25 to 30 people every other Sunday in
  nearby Boyle Heights. “As soon as I get the food ready I send my messages out
  that I’m on my way,” said Duran Zecca, who has brought dishes such as steak
  tortas, chicken kebabs, shrimp spaghetti and breakfast burritos to people’s
  front doors. “[The meals] are things that I feel will comfort them.” Since Ice
  began to infiltrate LA in June, once-bustling neighborhoods have become quiet.
  Vendors locked up stalls in the flower district. Popular taco stands and fruit
  carts are closed and some restaurants sit empty. Although it is unknown
  exactly how many people are staying home due to Ice’s aggressive arrests,
  immigration sweeps at restaurants, farms, Home Depots and even car washes have
  created a chilling effect on businesses that rely on immigrant labor.
  Restaurants such as Amiga Amore and other groups from the food and hospitality
  industry are stepping in to help people in their community who have nowhere to
  turn – even while their own businesses are suffering economically. Immigrants
  make up a sizable share of the workforce in the restaurant industry. According
  to the Public Policy Institute of California, a non-profit, nonpartisan
  thinktank, restaurants in the golden state are staffed overwhelmingly by
  Latinos and immigrants – 79% and 66% respectively. Nationwide, at least 20% of
  restaurant workers are immigrants. “Latinos are not only the backbone to our
  industry, they are the industry,” said Duran Zecca. “Behind every chef are
  Latino line cooks ready to make magic happen. All they want to do is work,
  make a living and feed their families.” To make her deliveries twice every
  month, Duran Zecca receives logistical support from her good friend Damián
  Diaz, the co-founder of No Us Without You, an LA-based non-profit that
  provides food security for undocumented people, including back of the house
  staff from bars and restaurants. “The administration has been doubling down on
  making it much more difficult for the families in the community and also small
  grassroots organizations like us to really be impactful,” said Diaz. In the
  past, No Us Without You had drive-through lines for food distribution, but
  stepped-up enforcement made that impossible, so they pivoted to working with a
  coalition of restaurants to serve up to 40 families every fortnight so they
  can shelter at home. “This environment of fear in light of increased
  enforcement, and really excessive enforcement, is causing folks to miss out on
  some very key necessities such as doctor’s appointments and going to the
  grocery store,” said Rita Fernández director of immigration policy project at
  UnidosUS, a Latino non-profit advocacy organization. “It’s leading to a point
  where people are withdrawing from public life.” This summer, Congress
  allocated $170.7bn in additional funding for immigration and border
  enforcement through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law
  by Donald Trump. The shocking sum is fueling Ice’s operations and creating
  what some critics call a “deportation-industrial complex”. “What we are seeing
  already is going to be turbocharged,” said Fernández. That’s why many others
  in the restaurant and non-profit industry have also been mobilizing to bring
  groceries to immigrants who are in hiding. The Oaxacan-Mediterranean
  restaurant X’tiosu in Boyle Heights, one of the US’s most heavily
  Latino-populated neighborhoods, packed 150 bags of fresh produce, dried pasta
  and other goods that were delivered to people in need by local Oaxacan youth
  in June and they have continued to support undocumented families. The
  student-led group, Raíces Con Voz, coordinated food and care package
  deliveries to more than 200 families, and Aquí Para La Comunidad, which
  operates throughout southern California, has a growing waitlist. Vanny Arias
  decided to host an impromptu food drive in front of the Offbeat Bar in
  Highland Park, where she’s a bartender, after realizing people staying home
  were likely in need of groceries. “We had signs, we were on social media and
  we got so much food it was crazy – we filled up half the bar with food,” she
  said of the July event. Arias organized with other community activists and
  volunteers to start dispensing basics. Once she launched an Instagram account,
  she started hearing directly from desperate families. “People said: ‘My
  husband got arrested’ or ‘We’re afraid to leave the house and my kids haven’t
  eaten in days,’” said Arias. “When you’re on the ground you see the hurt and
  pain in their eyes and hear it in their voices.” Since July, Arias’s Nela Food
  Distribution has grown to deliver free groceries to 150 people in and around
  Highland Park with the help of community donations, two local food warehouses,
  a bakery and a team of volunteers. “We’re a bunch of people who love their
  community,” said Arias. “I don’t care what color you are, we’re freaking
  humans and I’m here for you. You’re not alone.” And it’s not just in and
  around Los Angeles. Efforts to help feed people staying home have stretched
  throughout the state. When Mohamed Saeed, owner of Dinuba Food Center in the
  Central valley, saw that aggressive immigration enforcement was stoking fear
  in his community and keeping many of his regular customers away, he decided to
  launch a grocery delivery service in June. “People are really scared; Dinuba
  is slow, there’s no traffic and people aren’t going outside like before,” he
  said of the city, which is primarily populated by Latinos. Today, he makes up
  to 55 deliveries each day in and around Dinuba and tells his customers to only
  open the door once they see his logo on his truck. “I feel like if I make 40
  deliveries in a day I help save 40 families who are staying home,” said Saeed,
  who immigrated to the US from Yemen at age 13. “My job is to serve the people
  living here and if I don’t do that then I don’t deserve this job.” UnidosUS’s
  Fernández said these grassroots efforts emphasize the resilience of the Latino
  community and broader community and that people coming together to help their
  neighbors offers hope and kindness at a critical time. “My abuelita and my mom
  taught me hospitality at home; it’s always about helping people,” said No Us
  Without You’s Diaz. “The past years have been relentless for so many families
  and communities. I really want to create an impact. It’s not about changing
  the world, it’s about changing your community and the folks who live in it.”
