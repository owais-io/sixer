  Doctors are hailing a new pill for patients with high blood pressure resistant
  to existing medication as a “gamechanger” and a “triumph of science”.
  Globally, more than 1.3 billion people have hypertension. In half of them,
  their high blood pressure is uncontrolled or resistant to existing treatments.
  They face a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and early
  death. Now a blockbuster new drug – baxdrostat – has been shown in trials to
  significantly lower blood pressure in those people whose levels remain
  dangerously high despite taking several medicines. The results of the BaxHTN
  study, which involved 796 patients from 214 clinics worldwide, showed that
  after 12 weeks, patients taking baxdrostat saw their blood pressure fall by
  about 9-10 mmHg (millimetres of mercury, the unit of measurement of blood
  pressure) more than placebo – a reduction large enough to cut cardiovascular
  risk. About four in 10 patients taking the drug – 1mg (39.4%) or 2mg (40%)
  once daily in tablet form – reached healthy blood pressure levels, compared
  with fewer than two in 10 (18.7%) on placebo. Details of the breakthrough
  against stubbornly high blood pressure were revealed at the European Society
  of Cardiology congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.
  Results from the trial, which was sponsored by AstraZeneca, were
  simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Principal
  investigator Prof Bryan Williams, chair of medicine at UCL, said: “I’ve never
  seen blood pressure reductions of this magnitude with a drug. Achieving a
  nearly 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure with baxdrostat in the
  BaxHTN phase-3 trial is exciting, as this level of reduction is linked to
  substantially lower risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and kidney
  disease. “I think this could be a gamechanger in the way we approach difficult
  to control or hard to control blood pressure. The results suggest that this
  drug could help up to half a billion people globally.” The breakthrough has
  taken decades of research to achieve. Blood pressure is strongly influenced by
  a hormone called aldosterone, which helps the kidneys regulate salt and water
  balance. Some people produce too much aldosterone, causing the body to hold on
  to salt and water. This aldosterone dysregulation pushes blood pressure up and
  makes it very difficult to control. Tackling aldosterone dysregulation has
  been a key target of research over many years, but until now it has been
  impossible to achieve. Baxdrostat works by blocking aldosterone production,
  directly addressing this driver of high blood pressure. “This drug development
  is really a triumph of scientific discovery,” Williams told reporters at the
  conference in Madrid. “Aldosterone is a well-known driver of hypertension, but
  for decades, scientists have struggled to block its production in a precise
  way. Baxdrostat is one of the first therapies to do so selectively, showing
  meaningful BP [blood pressure] reductions in uncontrolled or resistant
  hypertension.” Historically, wealthier western countries were reported to have
  greatly increased levels of high blood pressure. However, largely due to
  changing diets, the numbers of people living with hypertension is now far
  higher in eastern and lower-income countries. More than half of those affected
  live in Asia, including 226 million people in China and 199 million in India.
  Prof Paul Leeson, a cardiologist and a professor of cardiovascular medicine at
  the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the trial, said the pill
  could become a “valuable additional treatment” to tackle high blood pressure.
  “For many years, we have had medications that are able to block aldosterone
  working but they do not actually lower levels of aldosterone, so patients may
  still experience adverse effects of the substance. “Baxdrostat … is one
  version of a new range of medications that work differently, and directly
  reduce the levels of aldosterone. “Importantly, the trial was performed across
  several countries and included men and women, as well as patients with
  different ethnic backgrounds. This helps ensure the findings are relevant to
  the range of patients we see with blood pressure problems.” Separately,
  doctors in Madrid were told that a cholesterol-busting jab administered twice
  a year has the potential to transform heart care. New trial data presented at
  the conference suggested Leqvio, also known as inclisiran and made by
  Novartis, helped patients meet their cholesterol goals faster than other
  therapies. Patients also experienced less muscle pain, a common side-effect of
  statins, the cholesterol-lowering medication.
