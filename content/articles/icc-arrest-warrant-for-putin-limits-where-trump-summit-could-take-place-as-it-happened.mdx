  This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the
  day. We will be back on Thursday. Here are the latest developments: Texas
  Democrats are staying out of their state, after they broke quorum for two
  consecutive days this week, to block a new GOP-drawn congressional map. Donald
  Trump could meet Vladimir Putin to try to broker an end to the Russian war on
  Ukraine as soon as next week, but finding a venue to host the summit might not
  be easy, given that the Russian president was indicted for war crimes in 2023
  by the international criminal court, and is subject to arrest in 125
  countries. Trump said that White House lawyers “are already studying” the
  possibility of legislation to overturn the law granting the District of
  Columbia self-rule and imposing direct federal control of the capital. The
  president added that part of the plan would include “bringing in the national
  guard” to police the district’s streets. Unions denounced the Department of
  Veterans Affairs after it announced that it was breaking union contracts with
  more than 370,000 federal workers employed in the nation’s largest integrated
  healthcare system. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York mayor,
  seized on a report that Donald Trump had an undisclosed phone call with Andrew
  Cuomo, the former New York governor who is running as an independent with the
  backing of Republican donors. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New
  York mayor, seized on a report that Donald Trump had an undisclosed phone call
  with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who is running as an
  independent with the backing of Republican donors. “Donald Trump has been
  coordinating with Andrew Cuomo, in direct conversation with the former
  governor,” Mamdani told reporters in response to a New York Times report on
  the conversation. “It is Trump billionaires who have been opposing our
  campaign’s vision for a city that New Yorkers can afford.” “Whatever Donald
  Trump seeks to do to influence the outcome of this election, I have more faith
  in New Yorkers themselves,” Mamdani said, “who have shown … that they do not
  want to support our current president’s vision of a New York City that is
  ripping immigrants from their homes, that is detaining New Yorkers on the
  basis of political expression.” On social media, Mamdani called Cuomo’s
  discussion with Trump, who is wildly unpopular in his home town,
  “disqualifying and a betrayal of our city”. Earlier on Wednesday, Cuomo’s
  younger brother, Chris, was forced to delete a social media post attacking
  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, after she pointed out that the TV news host had
  fallen for an obvious deepfake video supposedly showing her giving “a fiery
  speech” on the Sydney Sweeney “good jeans” debate. The crude Instagram video
  the younger Cuomo fell for was labelled “parody 100% made with AI”. The
  Department of Veterans Affairs announced on Wednesday that it was breaking
  union contracts with more than 370,000 federal workers employed in the
  nation’s largest integrated healthcare system, including nurses, doctors,
  benefits specialists, housekeepers, electricians, painters, food service
  workers, lawyers, dentists, pharmacists, crisis responders, mental health
  specialists, cemetery workers and janitors. In a statement, the VA said that
  it had notified five unions that it was immediately terminating their
  collective bargaining agreements, in line with an executive order signed by
  Donald Trump in March that sought to eliminate collective bargaining or
  workers at dozens of federal agencies on supposed “national security” grounds.
  Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees,
  said that VA secretary Doug Collins’ decision “to rip up the negotiated union
  contract for majority of its workforce is another clear example of retaliation
  against AFGE members for speaking out against the illegal, anti-worker, and
  anti-veteran policies of this administration”. “We know this administration is
  hellbent on silencing nurses and other VA workers to steamroll the destruction
  of the VA,” a statement from National Nurses United said. “This administration
  is marching toward the privatization of veteran care so they can move billions
  of taxpayer money out of the VA system, which is proven to provide excellent
  veteran-centric care, and into the coffers of private health care corporations
  run by billionaires.” “This union-busting decision is an ambush on the people
  who care for our country’s veterans and their right to stand together in a
  union, and will without a doubt harm the lifesaving services veterans
  desperately need,” AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler said. “It’s clear this is
  explicit retaliation against VA workers whose unions are standing up to the
  administration’s illegal actions in court and in the streets.” During an
  impromptu news conference in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Donald Trump was
  asked a tough question on Gaza by Nadia Bilbassy Charters, the Washington
  bureau chief for Al Arabiya, a news channel owned by the Saudi government.
  “You’ve said many times that you want to stop wars in the Middle East. Now
  prime minister Netanyahu is contemplating re-occupying Gaza entirely. Is he
  defying you, sir, or are you giving him a green light?” Bilbassy Charters, who
  grew up in Gaza, asked. Trump avoided the thorny question of whether or not he
  supports the Israeli prime minister’s reported plan to forgo a peace deal with
  Hamas and opt for full-scale military occupation of the Palestinian territory.
  Instead, he pivoted to the boast that, “we have stopped wars in the Middle
  East, by stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon.” The president was far
  more comfortable with questions laced with praise from two correspondents from
  far-right news outlets the White House invited to be present. One of them,
  Daniel Baldwin, the chief White House correspondent for the fringe, pro-Trump
  cable channel One America News, asked the president to talk about how the
  “manufacturing renaissance” he is bringing about “will positively impact the
  millions of Americans that trusted you with their vote”. The other, Brian
  Glenn, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, a network set up to host
  Steve Bannon’s podcast, told Trump he had “an entertainment-based question”.
  “A few weeks ago, Stephen Colbert announced that he was leaving his show.
  Howard Stern announced that him and SiriusXM radio are parting ways. Do you
  think the ‘Hate Trump’ business model that’s been in the entertainment
  business is going out of business?” Glenn asked. Stern has made no such
  announcement, although he is near the end of his contract with the satellite
  radio provider and there are rumors that the 71-year-old shock jock might end
  his show. Trump, a ratings-obsessed, former game-show host, eagerly took the
  invitation to trash late-night comedians who have mocked him. “Colbert has no
  talent,” he said. “Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They’re next, I
  hear they’re going to be going.” As for Stern, who frequently hosted Trump on
  his show before the developer turned reality TV host entered politics, “I
  haven’t heard that name in a long time,” Trump said. “You know when he went
  down?” Trump asked. “When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he lost his audience.”
  That seems unlikely, given that SiriusXM increased Stern’s salary from $90m a
  year in 2020, four years after he endorsed Clinton. In December 2020, as Trump
  was frantically lying about his election loss to Joe Biden, SiriusXM offered
  Stern an improved five-year, $500m deal which he accepted. The White House
  confirmed on Wednesday that Donald Trump could meet Vladimir Putin to try to
  broker an end to the Russian war on Ukraine as soon as next week, but finding
  a neutral venue to host the summit might not be easy, given that the Russian
  president was indicted for war crimes in 2023 by the international criminal
  court, and so is subject to arrest in 125 countries. That rules out Helsinki,
  where Trump and Putin met in 2018, since Finland is one of the 125 state
  parties to the Rome statute authorizing the ICC, and so would be obliged to
  act on the court’s arrest warrant should Putin visit. Switzerland, Austria,
  Iceland, Malta, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, which all hosted cold
  war era summits between American and Soviet leaders, are also out, for the
  same reason. Potsdam, where Truman met Stalin in 1945, is also impossible,
  since Germany is also a signatory to the ICC treaty. Yalta, where FDR met
  Stalin and Churchill earlier the same year, would no doubt appeal to Trump’s
  sense of his own historic importance, but it is, inconveniently for the
  subject matter of these talks, in Crimea, which was the first part of Ukraine
  seized by Russia in 2014. Trump is also unlikely to be welcome in Tehran,
  where FDR, Stalin and Churchill met in 1943, given the US air strikes on
  Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities six weeks ago. That could mean organizing
  a summit in Saudi Arabia or Turkey, where talks between Russia and Ukraine
  have already been held. Another possibility is Hungary, given that its prime
  minister, Viktor Orbán, is close to both Trump and Putin, and announced his
  government’s intention to leave the ICC in April, while welcoming Israel’s
  prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to Budapest, despite an ICC warrant
  against him for war crimes in Gaza. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office
  earlier today, Trump said: “We had some very good talks with president Putin
  today and there’s a very good chance that we could be ending the, ending the
  round — ending the end of that road. That road was long, and continues to be
  long, but there’s a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon”.
  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Donald Trump said that
  White House lawyers “are already studying” the possibility of legislation to
  overturn the law granting the District of Columbia self-rule and imposing
  direct federal control of the capital. The president added that part of the
  plan would include “bringing in the national guard” to police the district’s
  streets. The DC Home Rule Act, signed into law in 1973 by Richard Nixon, gives
  DC residents the right to elect the mayor, DC council members, and advisory
  neighborhood commissioners to run day-to-day affairs in the District. Trump
  suggested that DC was unsafe based on the anecdotal evidence of one assault
  early Sunday in the district on Edward Coristine, a former member of Elon
  Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency who uses the nickname
  “Big Balls” online. Although Trump suggested that the incident was proof that
  the district was unable to police its streets, DC police said patrol officers
  had intervened to stop the assault and arrested two suspected attackers, both
  15, on the spot. Emergency technicians then provided medical care to
  Coristine. During a White House event to announce new investments in
  manufacturing by Apple, Donald Trump said the United States will impose a
  tariff of about 100% on semiconductor chips imported into the country. Trump
  told reporters in the Oval Office that the new tariff rate would apply to “all
  chips and semiconductors coming into the United States” but would not apply to
  companies that had made a commitment to manufacture in the United States. “So
  100% tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States”,
  Trump said. “But if you’ve made a commitment to build [in the US], or if
  you’re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff,” Trump
  said. The White House has released a statement to reporters in which the press
  secretary, Karoline Leavitt, suggests that the idea of a direct meeting
  between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, was proposed
  by the Russians during Putin’s meeting with US special envoy Steve Witkoff in
  Moscow on Wednesday. “As President Trump said earlier today on TRUTH Social,
  great progress was made during Special Envoy Witkoff’s meeting with President
  Putin”, Leavitt said. “The Russians expressed their desire to meet with
  President Trump, and the President is open to meeting with both President
  Putin and President Zelensky. President Trump wants this brutal war to end.” I
  asked Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat who represents San Antonio in the
  Texas state legislature what it was like away from the cameras as he and his
  colleagues live out of a hotel room in Illinois with no idea of how long
  they’ll be there. “It’s important to just have the right mental focus and to
  stick to routines”, he said. “We’re still, you know, we’re still parents, and
  we’re still spouses. And we’re still trying to run our business or explain to
  our boss why we’re not there. We try to live, you know, we try to live a
  normal life, and we will rely on each other”. Texas’ part-time lawmakers earn
  just $600 a month, so many have other jobs and have been forced to work
  remotely from outside the state, if they can. Martinez Fischer wanted to make
  sure people knew that he and his colleagues are still doing legislative work,
  even though they’re not in Austin. He mentioned that he filed two bills
  yesterday. He said this was his fourth quorum break. He said he was a “one bag
  guy” and had packed some leisure wear to wear with polos and his best suit he
  could stretch out a few days. “I’m wearing some clothes today that I haven’t
  worn yet. So, you know, that’s a small success for me”. “When we talk about
  the grand scheme of what we, what we’re doing here and why we’re here, I mean,
  there are people who have had it a whole lot worse than me”, he said. He also
  said this quorum break feels different than the one in 2021, when Democrats
  fled the state for several weeks to try and stop a bill with sweeping new
  voting restrictions from going into effect. “2021, we spent more time trying
  to convince the country that there was an issue, right? This time, you know,
  there is no tutorial necessary and everybody is laser focused on the issue
  before us”, he said. “We don’t have to debate somebody on the merits of this
  walkout. I mean, they know the implications”. I just got off the phone with
  Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat who represents San Antonio in the Texas
  state legislature, and is one of dozens in his party who fled the state to try
  and stop Republicans from passing new Congressional maps. I asked Martinez
  Fischer if he could lend any insight into how long Democrats would hold out
  before returning. He declined to say. “These quorum checks and the strategies
  and end games are kind of best left undiscussed”, he said. “It’s a very fluid,
  it’s a very fluid dynamic. The idea that we had on Sunday may be different
  next Sunday”. Martinez Fischer said he’s not really concerned about the $500
  per day fines lawmakers are accruing under state legislature rules enacted in
  2023. “Not concerned about it at all”, he said. “We’ve had rules set aside
  before, and courts don’t have to interpret the rules the way Republicans want
  them to be interpreted”. He said he also wasn’t fazed by threats from top
  Texas Republicans to ask courts to remove Democratic lawmakers from office.
  Abbott filed a long-shot legal bid to do so against Gene Wu, the chair of the
  Democratic caucus, on Tuesday evening. “I think he recognizes that he’s on the
  losing side of this narrative”, Martinez Fischer said. “I think that the
  theories by which the governor is trying to remove people from office has a
  much more structured procedure than just filing some papers with the supreme
  court. So I don’t think that that kind of stuff happens overnight”. Texas
  Democrats are still hunkering down in blue states across the country. It comes
  after they broke quorum for two consecutive days this week, in protest of a
  new GOP-drawn congressional map. It’s now evolved into a nationwide
  redistricting battle. Former Democratic congressman Beto O’Rourke has emerged
  as a top funder, covering the costs of the lawmakers’ exodus through his
  political group ‘Powered by People’. In an interview with CNN earlier he said
  that state reps can “stay out long enough to stop this deal in Texas”.
  Meanwhile, many of the Texas legislators who decamped to Illinois were forced
  to evacuate from their hotel today when they experienced a bomb threat. The
  area was secured as bomb squad units conducted their investigation. No device
  was found according to local police. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was
  aware of the threats, in a post on X. “Threats of violence will be
  investigated and those responsible will be held accountable,” he added. In a
  post on Truth Social, the president said that “great progress” was made at a
  “highly productive” three-hour meeting today between special envoy Steve
  Witkoff and Russian president Vladimir Putin. This comes just two days ahead
  of a deadline Trump set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the war with
  Ukraine, or face fresh sanctions. The New York Times also reports that Donald
  Trump plans to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin as early as next
  week. Trump will then organise a follow-up for Putin, Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy and himself, sources tell the Times. Trump also followed
  through on his threats to increase tariffs on India. Earlier he issued an
  executive order today imposing an additional 25% on goods from India, saying
  the country directly or indirectly imported Russian oil. It brings the total
  levies against India to 50%. The president plans to meet with Russian
  president Vladimir Putin as early as next week, according to reporting from
  the New York Times. Sources tell the Times that Trump plans to follow up with
  a meeting between himself, Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
  The newspaper reports that Trump disclosed the details on a call with European
  leaders. Although, the meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy will not
  include any European counterparts, two people familiar with the plan tell the
  Times. This comes after a three-hour meeting today between special envoy Steve
  Witkoff and Putin, which Trump described as “highly productive” in a post on
  Truth Social. Facing images of violent white mobs defending racial
  segregation, the condemnation of the world and of its own citizens, Congress
  in 1965 passed the Voting Rights Act, a law meant to end the hypocrisy of a
  democratic country that denied Black people the power of their vote. Sixty
  years later, race remains at the center of American politics. Cases before the
  US supreme court, and a platoon of Texas legislators fleeing the state to
  prevent redistricting, demonstrate how the Voting Rights Act – and its erosion
  – remains on the frontline of the political battlefield. “Democracy is at
  stake,” said Todd Cox, associate director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense
  Fund. Even as voting rights advocates use the act to win additional
  congressional representation in Alabama and press cases in Louisiana and North
  Carolina, a conservative supreme court makes gains precarious, he said. Read
  more about how the Voting Rights Act is confronting its biggest threats in the
  60 years since its passage. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said,
  in a post on X, that Donald Trump has been briefed on the shooting at Fort
  Stewart in Georgia, and the White House is monitoring the situation. Five
  soldiers were shot and wounded today on the military base in south-east
  Georgia, before the shooter was taken into custody. Parts of the base had been
  locked down earlier on Wednesday after a shooter was reported on the sprawling
  army post, a spokesperson said. In an analysis by Politico, Democratic
  lawmakers from Texas stand to amass almost $400,000 in penalties, for leaving
  the state in protest during the special session that ends on 19 August.
  Politico crunched the numbers and worked out the total based on the fewest
  lawmakers needed to break quorum, the anticipated length of their out-of-state
  trips, and the $500-per-day fee they’re being charged. “Should Democrats
  refuse to return for the length of the entire special legislative session,
  which will end on Aug. 19, they could rack up fines totaling at least
  $382,500,” Politico estimated. In a post on Truth Social, the president said
  that “great progress” was made at the meeting between special envoy Steve
  Witkoff and Russian president Vladimir Putin. “Afterwards, I updated some of
  our European Allies. Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we
  will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,” Trump added. The
  meeting comes just two days before a deadline the president set for Russia to
  reach a peace deal in the war with Ukraine, or face fresh sanctions. Texas
  state lawmakers – many of whom decamped to Illinois to break quorum over the
  new GOP-drawn congressional map – were forced to evacuate from their hotel
  earlier near Chicago today. The St Charles police department said they
  responded to a report of a potential bomb threat at the Q-Center hotel and
  convention complex. Four hundred people were immediately evacuated, and the
  area was secured as bomb squad units conducted their investigation. No device
  was found. On social media, Democratic state representative John Bucy III said
  that “this is what happens when Republican state leaders publicly call for us
  to be ‘hunted down’,” referring to the Texas attorney general’s earlier calls
  to bring absent lawmakers back to the state house. Illinois governor JB
  Pritzker said he was aware of the threats, in a post on X. “Threats of
  violence will be investigated and those responsible will be held accountable,”
  he added. JD Vance will reportedly host top administration officials at his
  residence tonight, where they will discuss a strategy to address the fallout
  of the government’s mishandling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and come up with a
  “unified response”, CNN reports. Among the attendees will reportedly be,
  attorney Pam Bondi, her deputy Todd Blanche, FBI director Kash Patel and White
  House chief of staff Susie Wiles. It comes as the administration weighs
  whether to release the contents of Blanche’s interviews, including over 10
  hours of audio and a transcript, with Epstein accomplice and convicted sex
  trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Two officials told CNN that the materials could
  be made public as early as this week. One official told CNN that some of the
  conversation within the White House has focused on whether making the details
  from the interview public would bring the Epstein controversy back to the
  surface, at a time when many officials close to Trump believe the story has
  finally died down. Former Democratic congressman Beto O’Rourke, who has
  emerged as a top funder covering the costs of Texas lawmakers’ exodus, told
  CNN earlier that he believes they can “stay out long enough to stop this deal
  in Texas”. Donald Trump, Texas governor Greg Abbott, and Texas attorney
  general Ken Paxton are, O’Rourke said, “trying to steal these five seats in
  Texas because without them Trump’s going to lose a majority in the House of
  Representatives”. Without that majority, there’s a check on his lawlessness,
  accountability for his crimes and corruption, and the possibility of free and
  fair elections going forward. The 56 Texas Democrats who left the state are,
  O’Rourke said, “all that stand between that future and where we are right
  now”. I think what they’re doing is the highest form of public service.
  They’re trying to stop the consolidation of authoritarian power in America.
  They are the champions for this democracy, for America, for the rule of law
  and for our constitution. Paxton has called their leaving a “dereliction of
  the duty as elected officials” and said he would pursue a court ruling to
  declare the seats of “any rogue lawmakers” vacant if they do not return to
  work at the statehouse by Friday. “This matters more than any other priority,”
  said O’Rourke. “We have to stop their power grab.” He added: The election of
  2026 is going to be decided in the summer of 2025, so we have to fight now and
  every day going forward. US envoy Steve Witkoff’s meeting with Russian
  president Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Wednesday went well, a White House
  official has told Reuters, adding that Washington still planned to proceed
  with secondary sanctions on Friday. The Russians are eager to continue
  engaging with the United States. The secondary sanctions are still expected to
  be implemented on Friday. My colleague Jakub Krupa is covering this in greater
  detail over on our Europe live blog: It follows a Reuters report that
  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump spoke on the phone
  earlier today, according to a source familiar with the matter. Hours earlier,
  US special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. There
  haven’t been any immediate indication from either side as to how the talks
  went. We’re seeing lines on Reuters quoting a White House official that
  secondary US sanctions on Russia are expected to be implemented on Friday, the
  deadline Trump gave Putin to reach a peace deal to end its war in Ukraine. Up
  until this point Trump had been unusually reticent to punish the Russian
  president, my colleague Patrick Wintour wrote in a piece published this
  morning, so “what Trump – who some had claimed was a Russian asset – does next
  to punish Putin could define his presidency.” I’ll bring you more on this as
  we get it. If state legislators in California move ahead with governor Gavin
  Newsom’s plan to hold a special election – and begin the process of redrawing
  the state’s congressional maps in response to Texas’s plans – they’ll have
  just five days to announce their decision. The California legislature returns
  from its recess on 18 August, and it will have to declare a special election
  by 22 August, according to KCRA News. “They’re doing a midterm rejection of
  objectivity and independence, an act that we could criticise from the
  sideline, or an act that we can respond to in kind – fight fire with fire,”
  Newsom said in a press conference last week, referring to Texas Republicans’
  plans to pass a new congressional map. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  spoke with Donald Trump on the phone today, a source familiar with the matter
  told Reuters. This comes after US special envoy Steve Witkoff wrapped up a
  three-hour meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier today. My
  colleagues are tracking the latest here. In a post on his Truth Social
  platform, the president said he would “federalize” the city if local
  authorities failed to address crime, specifically calling for minors as young
  as 14 to be prosecuted as adults. Trump’s threat could theoretically take
  several forms. The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the
  federal district, though completely suspending local governance would likely
  require congressional legislation. Trump could also deploy federal law
  enforcement or national guard troops under executive authority, as he did
  during 2020 protests when federal forces cleared Lafayette Square outside the
  White House over local officials’ objections. But fully stripping the city’s
  home rule would likely face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress. Any such
  move would require congressional legislation that Democrats could block or
  attempt to challenge in federal courts. Washington DC, with a population of
  about 700,000, has actually seen violent crime decline in the first half of
  2025 compared with the previous year, and 2024 marked a 30-year low, according
  to a pre-Trump January report by the Department of Justice. The
  Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal
  interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full
  self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers
  have opposed. The office of the DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, declined a request
  for comment. On Truth Social today, the president labelled Democratic
  lawmakers in Congress as “extortionists”. Referring to last week’s failed
  negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats to quickly appoint
  several of Trump’s nominees. The president added: Politically embattled
  Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, wants the Republicans to pay, as EXTORTION, TWO
  BILLION DOLLARS in order for the Radical Left Democrats to approve the
  hundreds of Trump Appointments who have been waiting for months, and are
  raring’ to go. This has never happened before. There has never, in U.S.
  history, been such a delay. After taking six months to conclude that Vladimir
  Putin may not be a kindred transactional authoritarian leader but an
  ideological nationalist seeking the return of what “belongs to Russia”, the
  deadline Donald Trump set for the Russian president to agree a Ukraine
  ceasefire or face US sanctions on oil exports arrives on Friday. What Trump –
  who some had claimed was a Russian asset – does next to punish Putin could
  define his presidency. It is a remarkable turnaround and one that seasoned
  Trump watchers such as Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia,
  said they had never expected. Only months ago the debate was about what
  further inducements Trump would offer Putin to end the fighting. The Trump
  administration has not executed a new rollout of Russia sanctions in six
  months, a drop to zero from a minimum of 16 sets of actions in every preceding
  six-month period, a report by senior Democrats submitted to the Senate banking
  committee found this week. Read more here Donald Trump has issued an executive
  order today imposing an additional 25% tariff on goods from India, saying the
  country directly or indirectly imported Russian oil, adding to 25% tariffs
  already announced. Last week Trump had said the White House would impose a 25%
  tariff “plus a penalty” of an unspecified amount. The additional tariffs,
  which would come into effect after 21 days, mean India will face the highest
  levy along with Brazil, putting it at a significant disadvantage against
  regional competitors such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. There is thus mounting
  pressure on the Indian government to reach a deal. The move threatens to
  further complicate US-Indian relations and comes shortly after a Indian
  government source told Reuters Indian prime minister Narendra Modi would visit
  China for the first time in over seven years later this month. US-India ties
  are facing their most serious crisis in years after talks with India failed to
  produce a trade agreement. The White House move, first signalled by Trump on
  Monday, follows meetings by Trump’s top diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff in
  Moscow aimed at pushing Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine. Trump has
  threatened higher tariffs on Russia and secondary sanctions on its allies, if
  Vladimir Putin does not soon move to end the war in Ukraine. When Donald Trump
  fought for and won the 2024 presidential election, his victory was built
  partly on the false assertion that Democrats were responsible for an
  out-of-control crime wave in the US, with murders and rapes at record highs.
  Figures released by the FBI on Tuesday, however, confirm that the nation was
  as safe as it ever had been during the final full year of the Biden
  administration. Every category of crime decreased in frequency, and violent
  crime in particular dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s, per the
  report. The bureau’s annual Reported Crimes in the Nation Statistics report
  reflects a 4.5% year-on-year decrease in all violent crime nationally in 2024,
  with murder and non-negligent manslaughter falling 14.5% from the 2023 figure.
  Reported rapes were down 5.2% from the year before, while aggravated assaults
  and robberies declined 3% and 8.9% respectively. The figures belie Trump’s
  oft-repeated fear-mongering during the election campaign that “soft-on-crime”
  Democrats had fueled surging crime rates, particularly in major cities under
  their control. In May 2024, for example, Trump told reporters attending his
  hush-money trial in Manhattan that New York prosecutors were fixated on his
  prosecution while “people are being mugged and killed outside … [I’ve] never
  seen anything like it in my life”. Another story we’re keeping tabs on
  throughout the day is the ongoing redistricting battle in Texas. It’s one that
  has grown by the day, so here’s where things stand at the moment. State
  Democratic lawmakers broke quorum for two consecutive days – forestalling the
  Texas legislature’s special session. Democrats fled the state over the weekend
  to protest a new GOP-drawn congressional map that could see Republicans pick
  up five extra House seats in the 2026 midterms if it passes. While the
  legislators camp out in blue states like Illinois, New York and Massachusetts
  for “as long as it takes”, they’ve also set the stage for a showdown between
  the Texas governor and nationwide Democrats. The Texas Tribune reports that
  former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke has been a top funder covering the
  costs of the lawmakers’ exodus. A reminder, fleeing Democrats are also facing
  a $500-a-day fine for leaving the special session without permission. It’s a
  fee that representatives the Guardian has spoken to are paying out of their
  own pocket. Meanwhile, senator John Cornyn of Texas has asked the FBI to aid
  Texas law enforcement in locating and arresting Democrats who left the state.
  For his part, the state’s Republican attorney general Ken Paxton said he would
  pursue a court ruling to declare the seats of “any rogue lawmakers” vacant if
  they do not return to work at the statehouse by Friday. Beyond Texas’s
  borders, a redistricting “arms race” – as state representative Gina Hinojosa
  described to the Guardian – has ensued. California governor Gavin Newsom is
  pushing for a special election to ask voters to override the state’s
  redistricting commission, and approve new maps that would favor California
  Democrats if Texas moved forward with its gerrymandering plan. A White House
  official confirms to the Guardian that Donald Trump will make an announcement
  today that Apple plans to spend another $100bn on domestic manufacturing.
  Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is expected to attend. In February, Apple pledged to
  invest $500bn in the US over the next four years. Senator Marsha Blackburn of
  Tennessee announced today that she plans to run for governor of the state. The
  Republican lawmaker is now serving her second senate term. Outgoing governor
  Bill Lee, also a Republican, is term-limited. In a video announcement posted
  on social media, Blackburn said she is “ready to deliver the kind of
  conservative leadership that will ensure our state is America’s conservative
  leader for this generation and the next”. Blackburn is a staunch Trump ally,
  and aligned on many of his agenda items: from immigration to school choice.
  Currently, her main contender is Tennessee congressman John Rose, who
  announced his candidacy for governor back in March. The president is at the
  White House today. His public schedule is quiet for most of the day, but we
  can expect to see Trump at 4.30pm EDT today for an “announcement” in the Oval
  Office. It’s not immediately clear what the announcement will focus on. Hello,
  and welcome to the day’s live US politics coverage. I’m Shrai Popat and I’ll
  be bringing you the latest. Donald Trump has threatened a federal takeover of
  Washington DC, after an attempted carjacking of a former “department of
  government efficiency” (Doge) employee. On Truth Social, the president shared
  a picture of Edward Coristine – a 19-year-old former Doge staffer – who
  appeared bloodied after the assault. Trump wrote that DC is “totally out of
  control”, and if the city doesn’t “get it’s act together” he will have “no
  choice but to take Federal control”. At the beginning of his second term,
  Trump said he supports a federal takeover of the nation’s capital. As of now,
  the DC Home Rule Act of 1973 means that DC residents elect their local
  politicians who run the daily functioning of the city.

This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day. We will be back on Thursday. Here are the latest developments: Texas Democrats are staying out of their state, after they broke quorum for two consecutive days this week, to block a new GOP-drawn congressional map. Donald Trump could meet Vladimir Putin to try to broker an end to the Russian war on Ukraine as soon as next week, but finding a venue to host the summit might not be easy, given that the Russian president was indicted for war crimes in 2023 by the international criminal court, and is subject to arrest in 125 countries. Trump said that White House lawyers “are already studying” the possibility of legislation to overturn the law granting the District of Columbia self-rule and imposing direct federal control of the capital. The president added that part of the plan would include “bringing in the national guard” to police the district’s streets. Unions denounced the Department of Veterans Affairs after it announced that it was breaking union contracts with more than 370,000 federal workers employed in the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York mayor, seized on a report that Donald Trump had an undisclosed phone call with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who is running as an independent with the backing of Republican donors. Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York mayor, seized on a report that Donald Trump had an undisclosed phone call with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who is running as an independent with the backing of Republican donors. “Donald Trump has been coordinating with Andrew Cuomo, in direct conversation with the former governor,” Mamdani told reporters in response to a New York Times report on the conversation. “It is Trump billionaires who have been opposing our campaign’s vision for a city that New Yorkers can afford.” “Whatever Donald Trump seeks to do to influence the outcome of this election, I have more faith in New Yorkers themselves,” Mamdani said, “who have shown … that they do not want to support our current president’s vision of a New York City that is ripping immigrants from their homes, that is detaining New Yorkers on the basis of political expression.” On social media, Mamdani called Cuomo’s discussion with Trump, who is wildly unpopular in his home town, “disqualifying and a betrayal of our city”. Earlier on Wednesday, Cuomo’s younger brother, Chris, was forced to delete a social media post attacking Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, after she pointed out that the TV news host had fallen for an obvious deepfake video supposedly showing her giving “a fiery speech” on the Sydney Sweeney “good jeans” debate. The crude Instagram video the younger Cuomo fell for was labelled “parody 100% made with AI”. The Department of Veterans Affairs announced on Wednesday that it was breaking union contracts with more than 370,000 federal workers employed in the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system, including nurses, doctors, benefits specialists, housekeepers, electricians, painters, food service workers, lawyers, dentists, pharmacists, crisis responders, mental health specialists, cemetery workers and janitors. In a statement, the VA said that it had notified five unions that it was immediately terminating their collective bargaining agreements, in line with an executive order signed by Donald Trump in March that sought to eliminate collective bargaining or workers at dozens of federal agencies on supposed “national security” grounds. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said that VA secretary Doug Collins’ decision “to rip up the negotiated union contract for majority of its workforce is another clear example of retaliation against AFGE members for speaking out against the illegal, anti-worker, and anti-veteran policies of this administration”. “We know this administration is hellbent on silencing nurses and other VA workers to steamroll the destruction of the VA,” a statement from National Nurses United said. “This administration is marching toward the privatization of veteran care so they can move billions of taxpayer money out of the VA system, which is proven to provide excellent veteran-centric care, and into the coffers of private health care corporations run by billionaires.” “This union-busting decision is an ambush on the people who care for our country’s veterans and their right to stand together in a union, and will without a doubt harm the lifesaving services veterans desperately need,” AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler said. “It’s clear this is explicit retaliation against VA workers whose unions are standing up to the administration’s illegal actions in court and in the streets.” During an impromptu news conference in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Donald Trump was asked a tough question on Gaza by Nadia Bilbassy Charters, the Washington bureau chief for Al Arabiya, a news channel owned by the Saudi government. “You’ve said many times that you want to stop wars in the Middle East. Now prime minister Netanyahu is contemplating re-occupying Gaza entirely. Is he defying you, sir, or are you giving him a green light?” Bilbassy Charters, who grew up in Gaza, asked. Trump avoided the thorny question of whether or not he supports the Israeli prime minister’s reported plan to forgo a peace deal with Hamas and opt for full-scale military occupation of the Palestinian territory. Instead, he pivoted to the boast that, “we have stopped wars in the Middle East, by stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon.” The president was far more comfortable with questions laced with praise from two correspondents from far-right news outlets the White House invited to be present. One of them, Daniel Baldwin, the chief White House correspondent for the fringe, pro-Trump cable channel One America News, asked the president to talk about how the “manufacturing renaissance” he is bringing about “will positively impact the millions of Americans that trusted you with their vote”. The other, Brian Glenn, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, a network set up to host Steve Bannon’s podcast, told Trump he had “an entertainment-based question”. “A few weeks ago, Stephen Colbert announced that he was leaving his show. Howard Stern announced that him and SiriusXM radio are parting ways. Do you think the ‘Hate Trump’ business model that’s been in the entertainment business is going out of business?” Glenn asked. Stern has made no such announcement, although he is near the end of his contract with the satellite radio provider and there are rumors that the 71-year-old shock jock might end his show. Trump, a ratings-obsessed, former game-show host, eagerly took the invitation to trash late-night comedians who have mocked him. “Colbert has no talent,” he said. “Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They’re next, I hear they’re going to be going.” As for Stern, who frequently hosted Trump on his show before the developer turned reality TV host entered politics, “I haven’t heard that name in a long time,” Trump said. “You know when he went down?” Trump asked. “When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he lost his audience.” That seems unlikely, given that SiriusXM increased Stern’s salary from $90m a year in 2020, four years after he endorsed Clinton. In December 2020, as Trump was frantically lying about his election loss to Joe Biden, SiriusXM offered Stern an improved five-year, $500m deal which he accepted. The White House confirmed on Wednesday that Donald Trump could meet Vladimir Putin to try to broker an end to the Russian war on Ukraine as soon as next week, but finding a neutral venue to host the summit might not be easy, given that the Russian president was indicted for war crimes in 2023 by the international criminal court, and so is subject to arrest in 125 countries. That rules out Helsinki, where Trump and Putin met in 2018, since Finland is one of the 125 state parties to the Rome statute authorizing the ICC, and so would be obliged to act on the court’s arrest warrant should Putin visit. Switzerland, Austria, Iceland, Malta, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, which all hosted cold war era summits between American and Soviet leaders, are also out, for the same reason. Potsdam, where Truman met Stalin in 1945, is also impossible, since Germany is also a signatory to the ICC treaty. Yalta, where FDR met Stalin and Churchill earlier the same year, would no doubt appeal to Trump’s sense of his own historic importance, but it is, inconveniently for the subject matter of these talks, in Crimea, which was the first part of Ukraine seized by Russia in 2014. Trump is also unlikely to be welcome in Tehran, where FDR, Stalin and Churchill met in 1943, given the US air strikes on Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities six weeks ago. That could mean organizing a summit in Saudi Arabia or Turkey, where talks between Russia and Ukraine have already been held. Another possibility is Hungary, given that its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, is close to both Trump and Putin, and announced his government’s intention to leave the ICC in April, while welcoming Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to Budapest, despite an ICC warrant against him for war crimes in Gaza. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office earlier today, Trump said: “We had some very good talks with president Putin today and there’s a very good chance that we could be ending the, ending the round — ending the end of that road. That road was long, and continues to be long, but there’s a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon”. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Donald Trump said that White House lawyers “are already studying” the possibility of legislation to overturn the law granting the District of Columbia self-rule and imposing direct federal control of the capital. The president added that part of the plan would include “bringing in the national guard” to police the district’s streets. The DC Home Rule Act, signed into law in 1973 by Richard Nixon, gives DC residents the right to elect the mayor, DC council members, and advisory neighborhood commissioners to run day-to-day affairs in the District. Trump suggested that DC was unsafe based on the anecdotal evidence of one assault early Sunday in the district on Edward Coristine, a former member of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency who uses the nickname “Big Balls” online. Although Trump suggested that the incident was proof that the district was unable to police its streets, DC police said patrol officers had intervened to stop the assault and arrested two suspected attackers, both 15, on the spot. Emergency technicians then provided medical care to Coristine. During a White House event to announce new investments in manufacturing by Apple, Donald Trump said the United States will impose a tariff of about 100% on semiconductor chips imported into the country. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that the new tariff rate would apply to “all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States” but would not apply to companies that had made a commitment to manufacture in the United States. “So 100% tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States”, Trump said. “But if you’ve made a commitment to build [in the US], or if you’re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff,” Trump said. The White House has released a statement to reporters in which the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, suggests that the idea of a direct meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, was proposed by the Russians during Putin’s meeting with US special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Wednesday. “As President Trump said earlier today on TRUTH Social, great progress was made during Special Envoy Witkoff’s meeting with President Putin”, Leavitt said. “The Russians expressed their desire to meet with President Trump, and the President is open to meeting with both President Putin and President Zelensky. President Trump wants this brutal war to end.” I asked Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat who represents San Antonio in the Texas state legislature what it was like away from the cameras as he and his colleagues live out of a hotel room in Illinois with no idea of how long they’ll be there. “It’s important to just have the right mental focus and to stick to routines”, he said. “We’re still, you know, we’re still parents, and we’re still spouses. And we’re still trying to run our business or explain to our boss why we’re not there. We try to live, you know, we try to live a normal life, and we will rely on each other”. Texas’ part-time lawmakers earn just $600 a month, so many have other jobs and have been forced to work remotely from outside the state, if they can. Martinez Fischer wanted to make sure people knew that he and his colleagues are still doing legislative work, even though they’re not in Austin. He mentioned that he filed two bills yesterday. He said this was his fourth quorum break. He said he was a “one bag guy” and had packed some leisure wear to wear with polos and his best suit he could stretch out a few days. “I’m wearing some clothes today that I haven’t worn yet. So, you know, that’s a small success for me”. “When we talk about the grand scheme of what we, what we’re doing here and why we’re here, I mean, there are people who have had it a whole lot worse than me”, he said. He also said this quorum break feels different than the one in 2021, when Democrats fled the state for several weeks to try and stop a bill with sweeping new voting restrictions from going into effect. “2021, we spent more time trying to convince the country that there was an issue, right? This time, you know, there is no tutorial necessary and everybody is laser focused on the issue before us”, he said. “We don’t have to debate somebody on the merits of this walkout. I mean, they know the implications”. I just got off the phone with Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat who represents San Antonio in the Texas state legislature, and is one of dozens in his party who fled the state to try and stop Republicans from passing new Congressional maps. I asked Martinez Fischer if he could lend any insight into how long Democrats would hold out before returning. He declined to say. “These quorum checks and the strategies and end games are kind of best left undiscussed”, he said. “It’s a very fluid, it’s a very fluid dynamic. The idea that we had on Sunday may be different next Sunday”. Martinez Fischer said he’s not really concerned about the $500 per day fines lawmakers are accruing under state legislature rules enacted in 2023. “Not concerned about it at all”, he said. “We’ve had rules set aside before, and courts don’t have to interpret the rules the way Republicans want them to be interpreted”. He said he also wasn’t fazed by threats from top Texas Republicans to ask courts to remove Democratic lawmakers from office. Abbott filed a long-shot legal bid to do so against Gene Wu, the chair of the Democratic caucus, on Tuesday evening. “I think he recognizes that he’s on the losing side of this narrative”, Martinez Fischer said. “I think that the theories by which the governor is trying to remove people from office has a much more structured procedure than just filing some papers with the supreme court. So I don’t think that that kind of stuff happens overnight”. Texas Democrats are still hunkering down in blue states across the country. It comes after they broke quorum for two consecutive days this week, in protest of a new GOP-drawn congressional map. It’s now evolved into a nationwide redistricting battle. Former Democratic congressman Beto O’Rourke has emerged as a top funder, covering the costs of the lawmakers’ exodus through his political group ‘Powered by People’. In an interview with CNN earlier he said that state reps can “stay out long enough to stop this deal in Texas”. Meanwhile, many of the Texas legislators who decamped to Illinois were forced to evacuate from their hotel today when they experienced a bomb threat. The area was secured as bomb squad units conducted their investigation. No device was found according to local police. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was aware of the threats, in a post on X. “Threats of violence will be investigated and those responsible will be held accountable,” he added. In a post on Truth Social, the president said that “great progress” was made at a “highly productive” three-hour meeting today between special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian president Vladimir Putin. This comes just two days ahead of a deadline Trump set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the war with Ukraine, or face fresh sanctions. The New York Times also reports that Donald Trump plans to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin as early as next week. Trump will then organise a follow-up for Putin, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and himself, sources tell the Times. Trump also followed through on his threats to increase tariffs on India. Earlier he issued an executive order today imposing an additional 25% on goods from India, saying the country directly or indirectly imported Russian oil. It brings the total levies against India to 50%. The president plans to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin as early as next week, according to reporting from the New York Times. Sources tell the Times that Trump plans to follow up with a meeting between himself, Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The newspaper reports that Trump disclosed the details on a call with European leaders. Although, the meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy will not include any European counterparts, two people familiar with the plan tell the Times. This comes after a three-hour meeting today between special envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin, which Trump described as “highly productive” in a post on Truth Social. Facing images of violent white mobs defending racial segregation, the condemnation of the world and of its own citizens, Congress in 1965 passed the Voting Rights Act, a law meant to end the hypocrisy of a democratic country that denied Black people the power of their vote. Sixty years later, race remains at the center of American politics. Cases before the US supreme court, and a platoon of Texas legislators fleeing the state to prevent redistricting, demonstrate how the Voting Rights Act – and its erosion – remains on the frontline of the political battlefield. “Democracy is at stake,” said Todd Cox, associate director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Even as voting rights advocates use the act to win additional congressional representation in Alabama and press cases in Louisiana and North Carolina, a conservative supreme court makes gains precarious, he said. Read more about how the Voting Rights Act is confronting its biggest threats in the 60 years since its passage. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, in a post on X, that Donald Trump has been briefed on the shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia, and the White House is monitoring the situation. Five soldiers were shot and wounded today on the military base in south-east Georgia, before the shooter was taken into custody. Parts of the base had been locked down earlier on Wednesday after a shooter was reported on the sprawling army post, a spokesperson said. In an analysis by Politico, Democratic lawmakers from Texas stand to amass almost $400,000 in penalties, for leaving the state in protest during the special session that ends on 19 August. Politico crunched the numbers and worked out the total based on the fewest lawmakers needed to break quorum, the anticipated length of their out-of-state trips, and the $500-per-day fee they’re being charged. “Should Democrats refuse to return for the length of the entire special legislative session, which will end on Aug. 19, they could rack up fines totaling at least $382,500,” Politico estimated. In a post on Truth Social, the president said that “great progress” was made at the meeting between special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian president Vladimir Putin. “Afterwards, I updated some of our European Allies. Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,” Trump added. The meeting comes just two days before a deadline the president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the war with Ukraine, or face fresh sanctions. Texas state lawmakers – many of whom decamped to Illinois to break quorum over the new GOP-drawn congressional map – were forced to evacuate from their hotel earlier near Chicago today. The St Charles police department said they responded to a report of a potential bomb threat at the Q-Center hotel and convention complex. Four hundred people were immediately evacuated, and the area was secured as bomb squad units conducted their investigation. No device was found. On social media, Democratic state representative John Bucy III said that “this is what happens when Republican state leaders publicly call for us to be ‘hunted down’,” referring to the Texas attorney general’s earlier calls to bring absent lawmakers back to the state house. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was aware of the threats, in a post on X. “Threats of violence will be investigated and those responsible will be held accountable,” he added. JD Vance will reportedly host top administration officials at his residence tonight, where they will discuss a strategy to address the fallout of the government’s mishandling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and come up with a “unified response”, CNN reports. Among the attendees will reportedly be, attorney Pam Bondi, her deputy Todd Blanche, FBI director Kash Patel and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. It comes as the administration weighs whether to release the contents of Blanche’s interviews, including over 10 hours of audio and a transcript, with Epstein accomplice and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Two officials told CNN that the materials could be made public as early as this week. One official told CNN that some of the conversation within the White House has focused on whether making the details from the interview public would bring the Epstein controversy back to the surface, at a time when many officials close to Trump believe the story has finally died down. Former Democratic congressman Beto O’Rourke, who has emerged as a top funder covering the costs of Texas lawmakers’ exodus, told CNN earlier that he believes they can “stay out long enough to stop this deal in Texas”. Donald Trump, Texas governor Greg Abbott, and Texas attorney general Ken Paxton are, O’Rourke said, “trying to steal these five seats in Texas because without them Trump’s going to lose a majority in the House of Representatives”. Without that majority, there’s a check on his lawlessness, accountability for his crimes and corruption, and the possibility of free and fair elections going forward. The 56 Texas Democrats who left the state are, O’Rourke said, “all that stand between that future and where we are right now”. I think what they’re doing is the highest form of public service. They’re trying to stop the consolidation of authoritarian power in America. They are the champions for this democracy, for America, for the rule of law and for our constitution. Paxton has called their leaving a “dereliction of the duty as elected officials” and said he would pursue a court ruling to declare the seats of “any rogue lawmakers” vacant if they do not return to work at the statehouse by Friday. “This matters more than any other priority,” said O’Rourke. “We have to stop their power grab.” He added: The election of 2026 is going to be decided in the summer of 2025, so we have to fight now and every day going forward. US envoy Steve Witkoff’s meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Wednesday went well, a White House official has told Reuters, adding that Washington still planned to proceed with secondary sanctions on Friday. The Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States. The secondary sanctions are still expected to be implemented on Friday. My colleague Jakub Krupa is covering this in greater detail over on our Europe live blog: It follows a Reuters report that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump spoke on the phone earlier today, according to a source familiar with the matter. Hours earlier, US special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow. There haven’t been any immediate indication from either side as to how the talks went. We’re seeing lines on Reuters quoting a White House official that secondary US sanctions on Russia are expected to be implemented on Friday, the deadline Trump gave Putin to reach a peace deal to end its war in Ukraine. Up until this point Trump had been unusually reticent to punish the Russian president, my colleague Patrick Wintour wrote in a piece published this morning, so “what Trump – who some had claimed was a Russian asset – does next to punish Putin could define his presidency.” I’ll bring you more on this as we get it. If state legislators in California move ahead with governor Gavin Newsom’s plan to hold a special election – and begin the process of redrawing the state’s congressional maps in response to Texas’s plans – they’ll have just five days to announce their decision. The California legislature returns from its recess on 18 August, and it will have to declare a special election by 22 August, according to KCRA News. “They’re doing a midterm rejection of objectivity and independence, an act that we could criticise from the sideline, or an act that we can respond to in kind – fight fire with fire,” Newsom said in a press conference last week, referring to Texas Republicans’ plans to pass a new congressional map. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Donald Trump on the phone today, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. This comes after US special envoy Steve Witkoff wrapped up a three-hour meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier today. My colleagues are tracking the latest here. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the president said he would “federalize” the city if local authorities failed to address crime, specifically calling for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults. Trump’s threat could theoretically take several forms. The constitution grants Congress broad authority over the federal district, though completely suspending local governance would likely require congressional legislation. Trump could also deploy federal law enforcement or national guard troops under executive authority, as he did during 2020 protests when federal forces cleared Lafayette Square outside the White House over local officials’ objections. But fully stripping the city’s home rule would likely face fierce Democratic opposition in Congress. Any such move would require congressional legislation that Democrats could block or attempt to challenge in federal courts. Washington DC, with a population of about 700,000, has actually seen violent crime decline in the first half of 2025 compared with the previous year, and 2024 marked a 30-year low, according to a pre-Trump January report by the Department of Justice. The Democratic-controlled city has frequently clashed with Trump over federal interventions and has long sought statehood, which would grant it full self-governance and congressional representation – which Republican lawmakers have opposed. The office of the DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, declined a request for comment. On Truth Social today, the president labelled Democratic lawmakers in Congress as “extortionists”. Referring to last week’s failed negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats to quickly appoint several of Trump’s nominees. The president added: Politically embattled Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, wants the Republicans to pay, as EXTORTION, TWO BILLION DOLLARS in order for the Radical Left Democrats to approve the hundreds of Trump Appointments who have been waiting for months, and are raring’ to go. This has never happened before. There has never, in U.S. history, been such a delay. After taking six months to conclude that Vladimir Putin may not be a kindred transactional authoritarian leader but an ideological nationalist seeking the return of what “belongs to Russia”, the deadline Donald Trump set for the Russian president to agree a Ukraine ceasefire or face US sanctions on oil exports arrives on Friday. What Trump – who some had claimed was a Russian asset – does next to punish Putin could define his presidency. It is a remarkable turnaround and one that seasoned Trump watchers such as Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, said they had never expected. Only months ago the debate was about what further inducements Trump would offer Putin to end the fighting. The Trump administration has not executed a new rollout of Russia sanctions in six months, a drop to zero from a minimum of 16 sets of actions in every preceding six-month period, a report by senior Democrats submitted to the Senate banking committee found this week. Read more here Donald Trump has issued an executive order today imposing an additional 25% tariff on goods from India, saying the country directly or indirectly imported Russian oil, adding to 25% tariffs already announced. Last week Trump had said the White House would impose a 25% tariff “plus a penalty” of an unspecified amount. The additional tariffs, which would come into effect after 21 days, mean India will face the highest levy along with Brazil, putting it at a significant disadvantage against regional competitors such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. There is thus mounting pressure on the Indian government to reach a deal. The move threatens to further complicate US-Indian relations and comes shortly after a Indian government source told Reuters Indian prime minister Narendra Modi would visit China for the first time in over seven years later this month. US-India ties are facing their most serious crisis in years after talks with India failed to produce a trade agreement. The White House move, first signalled by Trump on Monday, follows meetings by Trump’s top diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow aimed at pushing Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine. Trump has threatened higher tariffs on Russia and secondary sanctions on its allies, if Vladimir Putin does not soon move to end the war in Ukraine. When Donald Trump fought for and won the 2024 presidential election, his victory was built partly on the false assertion that Democrats were responsible for an out-of-control crime wave in the US, with murders and rapes at record highs. Figures released by the FBI on Tuesday, however, confirm that the nation was as safe as it ever had been during the final full year of the Biden administration. Every category of crime decreased in frequency, and violent crime in particular dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s, per the report. The bureau’s annual Reported Crimes in the Nation Statistics report reflects a 4.5% year-on-year decrease in all violent crime nationally in 2024, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter falling 14.5% from the 2023 figure. Reported rapes were down 5.2% from the year before, while aggravated assaults and robberies declined 3% and 8.9% respectively. The figures belie Trump’s oft-repeated fear-mongering during the election campaign that “soft-on-crime” Democrats had fueled surging crime rates, particularly in major cities under their control. In May 2024, for example, Trump told reporters attending his hush-money trial in Manhattan that New York prosecutors were fixated on his prosecution while “people are being mugged and killed outside … [I’ve] never seen anything like it in my life”. Another story we’re keeping tabs on throughout the day is the ongoing redistricting battle in Texas. It’s one that has grown by the day, so here’s where things stand at the moment. State Democratic lawmakers broke quorum for two consecutive days – forestalling the Texas legislature’s special session. Democrats fled the state over the weekend to protest a new GOP-drawn congressional map that could see Republicans pick up five extra House seats in the 2026 midterms if it passes. While the legislators camp out in blue states like Illinois, New York and Massachusetts for “as long as it takes”, they’ve also set the stage for a showdown between the Texas governor and nationwide Democrats. The Texas Tribune reports that former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke has been a top funder covering the costs of the lawmakers’ exodus. A reminder, fleeing Democrats are also facing a $500-a-day fine for leaving the special session without permission. It’s a fee that representatives the Guardian has spoken to are paying out of their own pocket. Meanwhile, senator John Cornyn of Texas has asked the FBI to aid Texas law enforcement in locating and arresting Democrats who left the state. For his part, the state’s Republican attorney general Ken Paxton said he would pursue a court ruling to declare the seats of “any rogue lawmakers” vacant if they do not return to work at the statehouse by Friday. Beyond Texas’s borders, a redistricting “arms race” – as state representative Gina Hinojosa described to the Guardian – has ensued. California governor Gavin Newsom is pushing for a special election to ask voters to override the state’s redistricting commission, and approve new maps that would favor California Democrats if Texas moved forward with its gerrymandering plan. A White House official confirms to the Guardian that Donald Trump will make an announcement today that Apple plans to spend another $100bn on domestic manufacturing. Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is expected to attend. In February, Apple pledged to invest $500bn in the US over the next four years. Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee announced today that she plans to run for governor of the state. The Republican lawmaker is now serving her second senate term. Outgoing governor Bill Lee, also a Republican, is term-limited. In a video announcement posted on social media, Blackburn said she is “ready to deliver the kind of conservative leadership that will ensure our state is America’s conservative leader for this generation and the next”. Blackburn is a staunch Trump ally, and aligned on many of his agenda items: from immigration to school choice. Currently, her main contender is Tennessee congressman John Rose, who announced his candidacy for governor back in March. The president is at the White House today. His public schedule is quiet for most of the day, but we can expect to see Trump at 4.30pm EDT today for an “announcement” in the Oval Office. It’s not immediately clear what the announcement will focus on. Hello, and welcome to the day’s live US politics coverage. I’m Shrai Popat and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Donald Trump has threatened a federal takeover of Washington DC, after an attempted carjacking of a former “department of government efficiency” (Doge) employee. On Truth Social, the president shared a picture of Edward Coristine – a 19-year-old former Doge staffer – who appeared bloodied after the assault. Trump wrote that DC is “totally out of control”, and if the city doesn’t “get it’s act together” he will have “no choice but to take Federal control”. At the beginning of his second term, Trump said he supports a federal takeover of the nation’s capital. As of now, the DC Home Rule Act of 1973 means that DC residents elect their local politicians who run the daily functioning of the city.
