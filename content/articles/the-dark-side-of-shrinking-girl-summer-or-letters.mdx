  I read Rose Stokes’ article with great sadness (I thought we’d entered the age
  of body positivity. Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting
  smaller except me?, 10 August). Once again, a healthy, intelligent woman is
  made to feel not good enough by society because she is larger than a size 10.
  Then came anger, not with Stokes but with the media and brands that propagate
  a culture of skinny worship. I was born with a rare physical disability and
  have spent years coming to terms with the way my body is. I look disabled, I
  have scars from operations and a spinal curve surgeons couldn’t straighten,
  and I use mobility aids. To me, Stokes presents as an attractive, successful,
  healthy woman who is non-disabled (although this is her private business) with
  the good fortune to have two children. I wish Stokes and others could see
  themselves in that vein. Granted, it took me years to be happy in my own skin
  and see the strengths of my body, everything I’ve been through and the
  pleasure it can give and receive, but it’s doable. We are living in dark times
  when non-disabled women and men are wrecking their mental health and putting
  their physical health in danger with fad diets and weight-loss jabs, shrinking
  themselves to an ever-hungry and cold status to please others’ gazes and get
  likes on TikTok and Instagram. As a society we should be ashamed that we are
  engendering this, putting people at risk of eating disorders, malnutrition and
  mental health issues. We only have one body and if you’re fortunate enough to
  have one that works properly, you’ve won the jackpot. Name and address
  supplied • Self-loathing, shame, isolation and the desire for slenderness are
  not an intrinsic or inevitable aspect of being fat, as features such as Rose
  Stokes’ seem to suggest. They are caused by fatphobia. This has been
  ruthlessly exploited by weight-loss industries, including the contemporary
  manufacturers of GLP-1 drugs. These purveyors are not called to account when
  their products fail or harm their users. Instead, fat people are made to feel
  responsible. We should have tried harder. For a more balanced view, I invite
  Guardian editors, writers and readers to consider a social movement that has
  been active for at least 50 years and which takes a critical view of the
  obesity‑industrial complex. The scholarly field of fat studies and the public
  health model known as “health at every size” are offshoots. There are many of
  us working in these areas, providing a more nuanced and hopeful understanding
  of fat subjectivity. Charlotte Cooper London • Rose Stokes’ article strikes a
  chord across the femisphere. I would add that body dysmorphia has never been
  confined to women whose bodies don’t conform to skinny standards. The
  body-positivity movement liberated all women from these impossible strictures.
  It’s no coincidence that as soon as it arrived, and women began to take up
  more and powerful space, drugs were pumped out to make sure we take less.
