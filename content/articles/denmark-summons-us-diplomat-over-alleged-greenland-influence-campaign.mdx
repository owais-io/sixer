  Denmark has summoned the US charge d’affaires for an urgent meeting over an
  alleged influence campaign in Greenland aimed at shaping public opinion and
  the future of the Arctic territory. It comes after reports from Danish media,
  confirmed by the Danish foreign office, that at least three US men with ties
  to Donald Trump and the White House are accused of trying to infiltrate
  Greenlandic society. Their activity – which, according to broadcaster DR,
  include compiling lists of Trump-supporting Greenlandic citizens – is being
  closely watched by the Danish government, which is understood to be aware of
  “foreign agents and actors” trying to shape public opinion in Greenland. The
  Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, denounced the alleged scheme on
  Wednesday, saying it was “totally unacceptable”. He added: “It is important
  that we gain insight into this so that our populations – this applies to both
  Greenland and Denmark – can see what it is we are up against.” Rasmussen said
  officials would make it “very clear to the US” that a foreign influence
  campaign in Greenland with Washington’s backing would be contrary to all
  international rules. Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said she
  was taking the claims “very seriously”. “Any interference in internal affairs
  in the Kingdom of Denmark, and Greenlandic democracy, is unacceptable,” she
  said. “I note that the Americans do not clearly deny that the situation is as
  DR presents today. And that is of course serious,” she added. Donald Trump has
  repeatedly threatened to acquire Greenland since taking office, driving
  tensions between Denmark and the US to unprecedented levels. The former Danish
  colony is part of the kingdom of Denmark, although it is now autonomous with
  the exception of its foreign and security policy, which remains controlled by
  Copenhagen. In an unusual move aimed at highlighting the gravity of the
  situation between the two allies, Denmark’s highest-ranking civil servant will
  attend the meeting. The charge d’affaires was summoned in the absence of
  Trump’s incoming US ambassador, Ken Howery, who is yet to be confirmed by the
  US Senate. A date for his arrival in Copenhagen is yet to be confirmed, but
  Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, a friend of Elon Musk and the ambassador to
  Sweden under Trump’s first administration, is expected in the Danish capital
  in October. According to DR, the three unnamed American men are accused of
  attempting to permeate Greenlandic society to weaken relations with Denmark
  through what it describes as “infiltration” and “influence operations”. One of
  them, who it is claimed compiled a list of Trump supporters, has reportedly
  appeared in public with Trump numerous times. He is also accused of creating a
  list of those who do not support the US president and of advising on issues
  that “put Denmark in a bad light” in the US media. These allegedly include the
  forced removals of Greenlandic children by Danish authorities and a separate
  scandal over the forced contraception of Greenlandic women, for which
  Frederiksen issued a long-awaited apology on Wednesday. The two other American
  men whose activities have reportedly caused Danish authorities concern
  previously worked under Trump and are known to travel frequently to Greenland
  from the US. A government source said with the population of the capital,
  Nuuk, being about 20,000 people “it’s pretty obvious who is walking around and
  doing this”. A number of high-profile Americans with political connections and
  business people have flocked to Nuuk since Trump’s election. In January,
  Donald Trump Jr was joined by the political activist Charlie Kirk, who
  cofounded the pro-Trump conservative organisation Turning Point USA. In March,
  before Greenland’s election, Drew Horn, a member of the first Trump
  administration and the chief executive of the Washington DC-based mineral
  investment company GreenMet, said there are “tens of billions” of dollars
  ready to be invested in Greenland immediately. Tom Dans, Trump’s former Arctic
  commissioner and an investor, described Greenland as “really frontier in the
  true sense of things”. None of the men have been implicated by Danish
  authorities. Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament for the
  Greenlandic party Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), said the latest reports reflect a US
  effort. “We have seen before that they have been trying to influence the
  people of Greenland, but of course also Greenlandic politicians. This is just
  a continuation of that,” she said. But she said she had not seen evidence of
  an impact on people’s views. “I don’t think it is working. The Greenlandic
  people have been an object for people trying to influence us over many many
  years.” She said life for the Greenlandic people continues to be worse than
  for Danish people living in the Danish kingdom, especially as a result of
  underinvestment and the historic injustices against Inuit people. Although she
  said the US remains “on the table” when it comes to investment in Greenland,
  the impact of Trump’s words about acquiring Greenland – by force if required –
  has had an impact. Greenland, she said, is “much more sceptical towards the US
  than before”. Pele Broberg, who leads Greenland’s opposition party, Naleraq,
  which is seen as the most Trump-friendly of Greenland’s political parties,
  said he was “baffled” by the diplomatic clash, saying the claims were based on
  previously reported events from January. “Should we never talk to anybody but
  Denmark? We don’t get what the big issue is right now,” he said. He denied
  claims that the White House is trying to influence opinions in Nuuk, adding:
  “But what I do know is that the Danish, French and German governments are
  trying to influence the Greenlandic government every single day … It’s just
  business as usual.” This is the second time Denmark has summoned the US charge
  d’affaires since Trump assumed office. The first such meeting, in May, was
  over reports that US intelligence agencies have been ordered to increase
  espionage in Greenland. The US Department of State did not immediately respond
  to a request for comment. A representative of the US government said in a
  statement to DR: “Individual US citizens may have interests in Greenland. The
  US government does not control or direct the actions of private citizens.”
  They said the US “values the relationships with the governments of Greenland
  and Denmark,” adding: “The president, vice-president, and secretary of state
  have all been clear: the United States respects the right of the Greenlandic
  people to determine their own future.”
