  “A big nation like us,” Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto told the rank
  and file before him, “needs a strong military. No nation can be independent
  without having a strong military.” In a speech before inaugurating military
  troops in West Java this month, Prabowo – the former special forces commandant
  – proclaimed that Indonesia must strengthen its defences to protect the
  nation’s sovereignty and resources. Prabowo kicked off his presidency with a
  militaristic boot camp for his cabinet and now, just shy of a year in the job,
  the retired general is beefing up boots on the ground. One hundred new
  battalions have been established – with plans for 500 over the next five years
  – with new units also for the special forces and marines. The 100 new
  battalions have been established to assist in agriculture, animal husbandry
  and food security, and will not receive combat training. A spokesperson for
  the Indonesian defence ministry said he could not release information about
  the size of the new battalions. In the world’s third-largest democracy, the
  military’s expansion and its creep into civilian domains has drawn criticism
  from observers who say the move carries echoes of the country’s authoritarian
  past. Indonesia threw off the shackles of authoritarian rule in 1998, when
  Suharto, the country’s dictator and Prabowo’s former father-in-law, was forced
  to step down after 32 years in power. As part of the reform era that followed,
  the doctrine of dwifungsi, meaning dual function and which refers to the role
  of the military in security and civilian affairs, was dismantled. But bit by
  bit, it appears to be making a comeback. In March the Prabowo government
  passed a controversial law allowing armed forces personnel to hold more
  civilian posts. In addition to the 100 newly formed battalions, created as
  part of the army’s territorial deployment system, this July it was announced
  that the military will begin manufacturing medicines for public distribution,
  while within the attorney general’s office, a special taskforce that includes
  military officers has also been established to reclaim land from expired palm
  plantations. The deepening omnipresence of the military in Indonesian life
  signals a worrying democratic backslide, says Made Supriatma, a visiting
  fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak research institute. “Even without the
  formal dual function – dwifungsi – policy, you will see the military
  everywhere, having influence or control in politics, in policy, in government.
  They will be doing things that they are not supposed to do, where they have no
  expertise,” he said. The Indonesian government strongly rejects the claim the
  military expansion signals democratic regression. “The Indonesian military
  cannot interfere in civilian affairs. They don’t even have the right to vote
  in elections. So these accusations are completely exaggerated,” presidential
  spokesperson Hasan Nasbi told the Guardian. “Indonesia is increasing its
  military capacity to safeguard its vast territory. Indonesia is not just a
  vast landmass and seas, but also comprises 17,000 islands separated by sea.
  Therefore, it requires a strong army, navy, and air force,” he said, saying
  the new battalions were needed to protect the country’s sovereignty. But
  analysts note that Indonesia’s authoritarian turn began under former president
  Joko Widodo, and that his predecessor has continued the trend. “Basically this
  is somebody who is governing in 2025 using a mindset dated from the 1980s,”
  said Yohanes Sulaiman, associate professor at Universitas Jenderal Achmad
  Yani, “All of these are initiatives that were done in the ’80s to improve
  agricultural output, to improve livelihood … basically, the military has to be
  involved in helping the development of the state. “So this is a few steps
  backward in terms of professionalisation of the military.” Putting farms in
  the hands of military units was inefficient and had, historically, proven
  counter-productive, he said. “If you look at the role of the military, to be
  frank, they are not competent in doing this … If you want to be a farmer, then
  you have to live as a farmer. I mean, you have to be professional. “This is …
  a huge military interference in civil affairs.” The government says the
  military’s manufacturing of pharmaceuticals will make medicines cheaper, while
  the health minister has noted the new battalions could be utilised in natural
  disasters. “This programme is part of a policy to continue developing the
  nation’s defence posture to optimise its efforts to safeguard national
  sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security,” said defence
  ministry spokesperson Frega Wenas Inkiriwang. “Historically, the unity of the
  Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) with the people is an inseparable part
  of the Indonesian national identity, especially since the total people’s
  defence and security system is mandated by the constitution.” But political
  risk analyst Kevin O’Rourke of Reformasi Weekly said the addition of 100 new
  battalions wouldn’t add to military capacity and was “really perverse”. “It
  dissipates the military’s strength, deploying personnel who are relatively
  small in number for a country of its size, and deploying them in every region
  down to the subdistrict level. So if they were needed to congregate at a
  particular point it would take them weeks to assemble.” O’Rourke said the
  increase represented a further enmeshing of the military in civilian roles.
  But, he told the Guardian, “the extension of the special forces units marks a
  genuine increase in military capabilities and on the budget too, when there
  have been a lot of cuts.” Cabinet ministers have backed Prabowo’s plan, with
  finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati saying the country was committed to
  funding the new battalions, flagging a proposed defence budget of 335tn rupiah
  ($22bn) next year – about 37% higher than the 2025 forecast. The approval
  comes as Prabowo’s austerity drive has precipitated violent protests in
  several areas across the country. The new special forces unit will also be
  stationed at Timika, in Indonesia’s restive Papua, where Indonesian forces are
  accused of oppressing indigenous Papuans who have for decades fought for
  independence. The location, said O’Rourke, “signals a possible heavy-handed
  approach to the situation there”. The growing prominence of the military in
  Indonesia, said Supriatma, was indicative of Prabowo’s top-down rule. “Prabowo
  has a high distrust for the civilian bureaucracy,” said Supriatma, “This feels
  like something he can do to have more control, to build up the military to
  influence people, or to scare people.”
