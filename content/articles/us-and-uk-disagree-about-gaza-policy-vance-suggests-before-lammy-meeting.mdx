  The US and UK have “disagreements” on Gaza including over whether to recognise
  a Palestinian state, JD Vance has suggested as he arrived in England for his
  summer holiday. The US vice-president was speaking before a bilateral meeting
  with David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, at his 17th-century
  grace-and-favour country house, Chevening. His remarks on Gaza marked a note
  of discord in what otherwise appeared to be a convivial meeting between the
  two politicians, who have struck up an unlikely friendship. The pair have
  bonded over their Christian faith and difficult childhoods. Before speaking to
  reporters on Friday afternoon, Lammy and Vance were filmed fishing for carp
  together in a pond near Chevening House. Expressing his love for the UK and
  describing Lammy as a “good friend” and “gracious host”, Vance joked that
  their varying degrees of success in the carp pond was the “one strain on the
  special relationship”. “All of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary
  did not,” he said. Vance is staying at Chevening with his wife and family and
  will spend the weekend there with Lammy and his family before going on holiday
  to the Cotswolds. The vice-president said the people who had built Chevening
  and sustained it “really love the human spirit”, and heaped praise on the UK,
  saying it had a “lot in common” with the US and that the two countries should
  work together to “bring greater peace” to the world. While it has been billed
  as a private visit, Vance and Lammy held a formal bilateral on Friday
  afternoon where they discussed the continuing crisis in Gaza, including the
  Israeli security cabinet’s decision to take over Gaza City, as well as the war
  in Ukraine and US-UK trade and technology policy. A government source
  described the meeting as “constructive”. Before the meeting Vance noted Gaza
  as one area where there “may be disagreements” between the White House and
  Downing Street despite their shared goal to end the war. Asked by reporters
  for his thoughts on the UK’s plans to recognise Palestine, Vance said:
  “Obviously, the United Kingdom is going to make its decision. We have no plans
  to recognise the Palestinian state. I don’t know what it would mean to really
  recognise a Palestinian state given the lack of functional government there.”
  He said that while both governments wanted to resolve the crisis in Gaza, they
  “may have some disagreements about how exactly to accomplish that goal, and
  we’ll talk about that today”. In the recent past Vance has criticised the UK
  over what he saw as infringements to freedom of speech. In February, he
  claimed a “backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic
  liberties of religious Britons” under threat and he attacked the use of laws
  to enforce buffer zones around abortion clinics. Asked about his past remarks,
  the vice-president claimed on Friday that his concerns related more widely to
  “the entire collective west” as well as the US. “I think the entire collective
  west, the transatlantic relationship, our Nato allies, certainly the United
  States under the Biden administration, got a little too comfortable with
  censoring rather than engaging with a diverse array of opinions,” he told
  reporters. Lammy said “commonalities and differences” in political debate were
  part of the “joy of living in a democracy like ours”. The meeting took place
  hours after Keir Starmer urged the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
  to reconsider his plans to take over Gaza City, warning the move would only
  bring more bloodshed. Starmer said Israel’s decision to escalate the conflict
  was wrong and would do nothing to secure the release of Israeli hostages.
  “Every day the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and hostages taken by Hamas
  are being held in appalling and inhuman conditions. What we need is a
  ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas
  and a negotiated solution,” he said.
