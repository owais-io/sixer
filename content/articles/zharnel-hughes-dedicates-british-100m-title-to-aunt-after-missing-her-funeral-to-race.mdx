  After a sluggish start and a thunderous, triumphant finish, Zharnel Hughes
  dedicated his freshly claimed British 100m title to his aunt, whose funeral he
  was forced to miss so that he could compete in Birmingham this weekend.
  Hughes, the world bronze medallist, hails from the British Overseas Territory
  of Anguilla, where his aunt Iola was being laid to rest at the same time as he
  was taking on the best sprinters in Britain. The sacrifice paid off when he
  blitzed his way to a winning time of 9.94sec at the Alexander Stadium, before
  paying tribute to his family on the other side of the world. “Today is a very
  difficult day for me,” he said. “My auntie is getting buried right now. Her
  funeral is going on and I’m missing out. I was very close with her, so today
  was a bit of a mental strength game for me. “I had to keep suppressing inside
  and I couldn’t speak to my family because I would get emotional. Jeremiah
  [Azu] was trying to console me because I almost started crying. This win was
  for her.” As a world medallist, Hughes was already assured of a 100m spot in
  the British team for next month’s Tokyo world championships, but runner-up Azu
  now has work to do. The world and indoor 60m champion surged into an early
  lead before he was reined in heading towards the finish line. His time of
  9.97sec will not count as a world championships qualifying standard due to the
  2.2m/s tailwind, leaving him three weeks to chase the required 10sec time
  before the team is confirmed. Louie Hinchliffe, who already has the standard,
  clocked 10.01sec for bronze. There was drama before the women’s 100m when the
  favourite Daryll Neita, who finished fourth at the Olympics last year, was
  harshly disqualified for a false start after twitching in her blocks. Her
  absence – having clocked a dominant 11.00sec to win her semi-final at a canter
  – meant no one came close to challenging Amy Hunt, who triumphed in a personal
  best 11.02sec to secure her seat on the plane for Tokyo. With Dina Asher-Smith
  – who is contesting only the 200m this weekend – guaranteed her spot, that
  leaves Neita uncertain of the final place. Desiree Henry, who finished second
  in 11.32sec, will now attempt an unlikely bid to clock the qualifying standard
  of 11.07sec. Neita will hope she does not succeed. “It would have been nice to
  have Daryll in the race,” said Hunt. “That was a big loss. I wanted to come
  out here and beat her. I want to prove myself in a head to head, so to not get
  the chance to race her was disappointing for me because I think that would
  have pushed me to an even quicker time. I personally would have run under
  protest, but the nature of championship racing is you have to hold your nerve
  on the line.” Hunt, Neita and Asher-Smith will now battle over 200m on Sunday,
  with the trio separated by less than half a second on season’s bests. The
  podium in Tokyo is the definite aim for Molly Caudery, who made light work of
  a modest pole vault field, wrapping up the British title with her second
  effort and continuing to move top of this summer’s global standings by
  clearing 4.85m. She insisted she will not be affected by the trauma of last
  year’s Olympics, where she failed to record a single valid attempt when
  expected to challenge for gold. “It happened. It was just a bad day,” she
  said. “I definitely don’t think it will happen again and I’ll do everything in
  my power to make sure it doesn’t happen again. I’ve overcome all the demons
  that came from it. It’s all in the past. “I would love to get a medal. After
  what happened last year, I was so focused on getting a medal, I just need to
  get through qualification first and then think about it. But that’s definitely
  the big goal for the year.” Elsewhere, there were championship records in two
  throwing events, with Anna Purchase winning the hammer in 72.96m and Lawrence
  Okoye claiming the discus in 65.93m.
