  Late-night hosts talked about Donald Trump’s rambling Truth Social posts and
  Taylor Swift’s new album announcement. Seth Meyers Seth Meyers opened
  Tuesday’s Late Night with a recap of Donald Trump’s effort to take over the
  metro police in Washington DC. During Monday’s announcement that the federal
  government would deploy national guard troops in the city, Trump said that he
  wanted residents to feel safe going to the store to buy a newspaper. “You
  think I need to go to the store to buy a newspaper? Is that right after my
  milk gets delivered?” Meyers laughed. During the same press conference, Trump
  also discussed his upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, and said, “I think it
  will be good, but it might be bad.” “Only Trump talks about a peace conference
  like it’s a new Marvel movie,” said Meyers, adding: “Look, they got Chris
  Evans back and worst-case scenario, the place has AC.” In a post last week on
  Truth Social, Trump promoted a book about the assassination attempt on his
  life last summer, but misspelled the author’s name. “Don’t take it personally,
  he also misspelled his wife’s name,” said Meyers, pointing out that Trump
  called Melania “Melanie” on Truth Social, as well. “At this point, we should
  just be glad that he can manage his own – oh right, can’t do that either.” In
  another post to Truth Social, Trump said the Democratic congresswoman Jasmine
  Crockett had a “low (very!!!) IQ” and that she should take a cognitive test
  ‘much like the one I recently took while getting my ‘physical’ at our GREAT
  Washington DC Military Hospital.” “Do you mean Walter Reed?” said Meyers,
  referring to the famous military hospital where Trump underwent this test.
  “There’s nothing quite like bragging about your cognitive ability as you
  forget the name of the famous place where you took your dementia test.” Trump
  added that he “ACED” the cognitive test, “something that is rarely seen”. “OK,
  again, it is a test to make sure that you don’t have brain damage,” said
  Meyers. “It’s the written version of a boxing referee holding up three
  fingers. He doesn’t do that if you seem fine!” And during a meeting last week
  with business leaders, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo compared his
  relationship with Donald trump to a “dysfunctional marriage”. “Well, you know,
  what’s one more?” said Meyers next to a photo of Trump and Melania. Jimmy
  Fallon On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon reacted excitedly to the news of
  Taylor Swift’s new album. The singer confirmed her 12th album, The Life of a
  Showgirl, at 12:12am ET on 12 August in a teaser trailer for the New Heights
  podcast hosted by her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason. “Americans
  are like, wait … there’s good news out there?” Fallon joked. “I don’t know
  what to do with myself!” “Seriously, we all need Taylor Swift right now,” he
  continued, “because without her music and her merchandise, we end up doing
  weird stuff like starting our labubu collection.” The announcement made
  Swift’s website crash, “and then out of habit, so did Ticketmaster’s”, Fallon
  quipped. “As of now we don’t know the exact release date, but we do know that
  no one else is releasing music that day,” he added. In political news, the
  White House confirmed that Trump’s upcoming meeting with Putin would take
  place in the city of Anchorage, Alaska. “Temperatures should be overcast and
  in the 50s,” said Fallon. “Or as Putin put it: beach weather, baby!” The White
  House also said the meeting with Putin would be a “listening exercise” for
  Trump. “And we all know listening and exercise are Trump’s two favorite
  things,” said a skeptical Fallon. “This should go well.” Trump, for his part,
  said he would know “probably in the first two minutes” whether a deal is
  possible with Putin for peace in Ukraine, which was not invited to the summit.
  “It’s reassuring when a president talks about ending a war like a Tinder
  date,” Fallon joked. But that amount of time makes sense, he added, “because
  according to Stormy Daniels, two minutes is plenty”.
