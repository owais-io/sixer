  Coco Gauff arrived in New York with more questions than answers after
  reshuffling her coaching team on the eve of the year’s final grand slam. Her
  second major at Roland Garros in June had given way to a summer-long revolt of
  her serve, often marked by spates of double faults and premature exits,
  including a first-round departure from Wimbledon. She has framed the change as
  a long-term fix rather than a quick repair, saying she did not want to “waste
  time playing a way I don’t want to play”. After two tense night sessions to
  launch her US Open campaign, the 21-year-old American finally looked settled
  on Saturday morning, advancing to the second week of her home major for the
  fourth year running with a 6-3, 6-1 dismissal of Poland’s Magdalena Frech. To
  address her serving woes, Gauff has enlisted Gavin MacMillan, the biomechanics
  specialist who helped Aryna Sabalenka rein in her serving yips and climb to
  the world No 1 ranking with three major titles. The first two rounds showed
  the transition was bumpy for the No 3 seed: a three-set struggle against Ajla
  Tomljanovic, then tears on court in a fraught win over Donna Vekic. “It’s been
  an emotional week,” Gauff said. “I think I needed those tough moments to be
  able to move forward. I was putting so much pressure on myself.” This time
  there was no unraveling. Under bright sunshine rather than the Ashe
  floodlights before a robust Labor Day weekend crowd, Gauff struck just four
  double faults, built a 3-0 lead and, when Frech briefly levelled at 3-all,
  responded with assurance. Serving at 40-30 in a tense seventh game, she
  steadied with a 105mph delivery that drew an error, clenched her fist and
  surged through the rest of the set. The second set was more straightforward. A
  bruising 20-shot exchange went Gauff’s way to earn the first break, while
  another break at love followed two games later as Frech’s errors mounted. The
  Pole, seeded at a major for the first time, could not hurt the American once
  rallies extended. “She gives you no pace, maybe not too many angles to work
  with, so you kind of have to create all the opportunity for yourself,” Gauff
  said afterwards. Her delivery, so fragile in recent months, became a source of
  confidence. She landed nearly 80% of first serves in the opener and conceded
  only two points on serve during the second set. Even when a fourth double
  fault appeared as she tried to close, she brushed away the danger with a crisp
  volley before sealing victory after 73 minutes with a quiet pump of her left
  fist. “Today I definitely think was a step in the right direction,” she said.
  “I’m more proud of the mental effort … remembering the things that we worked
  on in practice.” The contrast with her opening rounds was stark. Instead of
  tense body language and second-guessing, she attacked from the baseline and
  looked to finish points at the net. The serve remains a work in progress,
  particularly the toss, but the rhythm was smoother and her self-belief
  clearer. She even suggested Thursday’s tears might have served a purpose:
  “Maybe it’s not a weakness,” she reflected. “It’s just showing the things that
  happen in my head … Today I felt a lot lighter going on court.” For Frech, the
  world No 28, this was still a week of progress. She had never previously
  reached the US Open’s third round and her win over Peyton Stearns ensured a
  career-best result here. But against Gauff the gulf in experience told. The
  American, making her 25th appearance in a grand slam main draw, already owns
  two major titles – and boasts a 30-1 record at the majors over the past two
  years against opponents ranked outside the top 20. That precocity places her
  among rare company. Only Venus Williams has reached more second weeks at grand
  slams among US women before turning 22. “This is the level I want to play,”
  Gauff said. “I know the competition gets tougher from here, but if I keep
  building from today, I like where my game is going.” Gauff now advances to a
  delicious fourth-round clash on Monday with Naomi Osaka, the two-time US Open
  champion who beat 15th seed Daria Kasatkina 6-0, 4-6, 6-2 to reach the second
  week of a major for the first time since 2021. It will be their sixth meeting
  – Gauff leads 3-2 in the head-to-head – and their first in New York since
  Osaka’s straight-sets win in 2019, when she was world No 1 and Gauff a
  15-year-old wildcard. “It would be a cool kind of déjà vu, but hopefully with
  a different result,” Gauff said. “I remember it was a tough moment because it
  was such a hyped-up match. Looking back, I put way too much pressure on
  myself, thinking I had a chance to do something. I probably did, but I felt
  more expectation than belief.”
