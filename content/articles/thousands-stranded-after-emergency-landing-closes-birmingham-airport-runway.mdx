  Thousands of holidaymakers have been left stranded after flights at Birmingham
  airport were grounded on Wednesday when a small aircraft made an emergency
  landing. Three people from the aircraft were treated at the scene, one of whom
  suffered minor injuries in the incident, which occurred at about 1.40pm, West
  Midlands police said. At least 25 flights listed on the departures page of the
  airport’s website to destinations across Europe had been cancelled. Just
  before 8pm Birmingham Airport said its runway had reopened and flights had
  started to depart. The hub apologised for the disruption caused by the
  incident and said passengers must check flight details and follow advice
  issued by their airlines. Some flights had to be diverted to Manchester and
  East Midlands airports. Passengers have been told to check the status of their
  flight before coming to Birmingham airport, where check-in and security were
  also temporarily closed. All of those onboard the Beechcraft B200 Super King
  Air, which was flying to Belfast, have been discharged. Earlier, Birmingham
  airport posted on X: “Following an aircraft incident that occurred this
  afternoon, operations are expected to remain suspended until at least 8pm.
  Passengers at the airport are advised to speak to their airline for further
  information. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.” The
  transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said disruption at the airport was
  “minimal” but she understood “how frustrating” the situation was for
  passengers. Gunnar Lauridsen, 76, from Denmark had been on holiday playing
  golf, and said he would most likely miss his connecting flight because of the
  closed runway. “We are ultimately going to Billund in Denmark,” he said. “This
  delay probably means we can’t get our connection, so that means that we will
  be staying probably in Amsterdam overnight. “I should have been to the doctors
  tomorrow morning. When you travel things happen.” Camile Monteleone, 30, was
  meant to fly home to Barcelona after working in the UK for three days but did
  not know if her flight from the airport had been cancelled. The visual
  merchandiser said: “I don’t have any news … It doesn’t say anything on the
  Ryanair app about the flight. I’m just waiting for information. I have to let
  people know I’m here, stuck at the airport. I can’t do anything else.” Faye
  Melhuish, 38, who arrived home from a holiday in Spain with her six-month-old
  daughter, said her flight had been unable to land at Birmingham and had to be
  diverted. “We flew from Spain and we were due to land here at 2.20pm,” she
  said. “Then in the air we were circling to see if we could land. The captain
  basically said we are going to have to go to East Midlands.” Speaking about
  her daughter, Melhuish said: “It’s her first time on a plane and her first
  time on a coach.” West Midlands police had previously posted on X: “We are at
  Birmingham airport this afternoon after a small aircraft was involved in an
  emergency landing at around 1.40pm. Officers are among the emergency crews at
  the scene and one person has been reported to have minor injuries. “The Civil
  Aviation Authority has been informed and the airport has suspended operations
  as an investigation is carried out.” The response to the incident will be led
  by the Air Accidents Investigations Branch, a CAA spokesperson said. “In the
  event of delays or cancellations, passengers will be expected to be provided
  with food and drink as well as accommodation if delayed overnight,” they said.
  The Air Accidents Investigations Branch said it had started an investigation
  into the incident, with “a multi-disciplinary team including inspectors with
  expertise in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data” deployed to
  the airport. Woodgate Aviation said one of its Beechcraft aircraft was
  involved in the emergency landing as a result of landing gear problems.
