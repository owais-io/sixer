  The heated US war over abortion pills warmed up another degree on Wednesday,
  as the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sent cease-and-desist letters to
  two organizations and an individual that he accused of mailing abortion pills
  to Texans or facilitating their shipment. Paxton threatened to sue if they do
  not stop their alleged activities. “These abortion drug organizations and
  radical activists are not above the law, and I have ordered the immediate end
  of this unlawful conduct,” Paxton said in a news release announcing the
  letters. The state of Texas bans virtually all abortions. Paxton sent the
  letters to Plan C, a website that provides information about how to obtain
  abortion pills; Her Safe Harbor, an organization that provides abortions
  through telemedicine; and Rémy Coeytaux, a doctor who has been accused of
  mailing abortion pills to a Texan. Debra Lynch, a nurse practitioner who works
  with Her Safe Harbor, said that Paxton’s letter would not stop the
  organization from sending abortion pills to people. If anything, Lynch
  suggested, it would spur the group on. “None of our providers are primarily
  concerned with our own wellbeing or our own legal status,” Lynch said. “All
  the horrors that women are facing because of these ridiculous bans and
  restrictions outweigh anything that could possibly happen to us as providers,
  in terms of a fine or a lawsuit or even jail time, if it were to come to
  that.” Lynch said that in the hours after news of Paxton’s letter broke, Her
  Safe Harbor received more than 150 requests from Texans who were afraid about
  abortion access and want to obtain pills that they may use in the future.
  Normally, Her Safe Harbor has around four to five providers taking calls from
  patients. Now, they plan to have at least 10 working “until this wave of fear
  subsides”. Neither Plan C nor Coeytaux immediately replied to the Guardian’s
  request for comment. In the three years since the US supreme court overturned
  Roe v Wade and unleashed a wave of state-level abortion bans, abortions have
  surged in the United States. This rise is due in large part to the
  availability of abortion pills and the emergence of “shield laws”, which have
  been enacted by a handful of blue states and aim to protect abortion providers
  who mail pills across state lines from out-of-state prosecution. By the end of
  2024, clinicians working through shield laws were facilitating an average of
  12,330 abortions per month, according to data from #WeCount, a research
  project by the Society of Family Planning. Enraged by this development,
  anti-abortion advocates have in recent months stepped up their campaign to
  crush abortion pill providers. In his cease-and-desist letters, Paxton – a
  Republican who is running to become a US senator – repeatedly cited the
  Comstock Act of 1873, an anti-vice law that bans the mailing of
  abortion-related materials. Although legal experts have long regarded the
  Comstock Act as a dead letter, several anti-abortion activists now believe
  that the fall of Roe has left the federal government free to fully enforce the
  act. Alongside 15 other state attorneys general, Paxton earlier this summer
  signed onto a letter imploring Congress to pass a law that would pre-empt
  states’ shield laws. He has also sued a New York-based doctor whom he accused
  of mailing abortion pills into Texas. Then, after a New York county court
  official said that the state’s shield law prohibited New York from enforcing a
  fine against the doctor, Paxton sued the official. Paxton’s cease-and-desist
  letters also follow similar letters sent by the Arkansas attorney general,
  Republican Tim Griffin. In July, Griffin sent a cease-and-desist letter to
  Possibility Labs, the parent company of Plan C, and to Mayday Medicines, the
  parent company of Mayday Health. Like Plan C, Mayday Health offers information
  about abortion pills, but does not directly sell them. Other anti-abortion
  activists are going after abortion providers through other legal avenues. A
  Texas man who said that Coeytaux supplied abortion pills to aid his female
  partner’s abortion has also sued Coeytaux in a federal wrongful death lawsuit.
  The man is being represented in court by Jonathan Mitchell, an anti-abortion
  attorney who masterminded a six-week abortion ban that took effect in Texas in
  2021. Last week, Mitchell filed another federal wrongful death lawsuit against
  a different abortion provider.
