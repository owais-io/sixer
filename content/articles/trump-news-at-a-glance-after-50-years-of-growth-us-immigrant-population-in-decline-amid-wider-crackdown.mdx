  than 50 years, has declined by more than a million people since Donald Trump
  took office in January. According to a new study by the Pew Research Center,
  there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the US in January, when Trump
  took office for the second time. By June, that number had dropped to 51.9
  million. Among all US residents, 15.4% were immigrants as of June 2025, down
  from the recent historic high of 15.8% in January. The Pew survey also found
  that 750,000 immigrant workers had dropped out of the US labor force since
  January, which is now 19% foreign-born. Here are the key Trump administration
  news stories of the day: US immigrant population falls amid Trump crackdown
  The Pew Research Center pointed to several policy changes that have affected
  immigrant populations across the US, including Joe Biden’s restrictions on
  asylum applications in 2024, which led to a significant decrease in border
  crossings involving immigrants seeking asylum. Additionally, the center
  pointed to Donald Trump’s 181 executive actions targeting immigration,
  including the arrival of new immigrants and the mass deportation of noncitizen
  immigrants. Read the full story US intends to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to
  Uganda US immigration officials said they intended to deport Kilmar Ábrego
  García to Uganda after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in
  exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges,
  according to a Saturday court filing. The 30-year-old was initially deported
  by federal immigration officials in March. The Trump administration admitted
  Ábrego’s deportation was an “administrative error” but officials have
  repeatedly accused him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego
  and his family vehemently deny. Read the full story Pentagon blocks Ukraine
  from striking deep inside Russia – report US defense officials have stopped
  Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside
  Russia since late spring as part of a Trump administration effort to get
  Vladimir Putin to engage in peace talks, according to a report on Saturday.

  order. Read the full story Texas Senate approves redrawn congressional map
  favouring Republicans The Texas Senate has given final approval to a redrawn
  congressional map that gives Republicans a chance to pick up as many as five
  congressional seats, fulfilling a brazen political request from Donald Trump
  to shore up the GOP’s standing before next year’s midterm elections. It will
  now be sent to governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, who is expected to quickly
  sign it into law. Read the full story What else happened today: Students and
  faculty heading back to US colleges and universities from summer break are
  returning to bruised institutions reeling from the Trump administration’s
  unprecedented campaign to bend higher education to its ideological will, and
  are bracing for more uncertainty ahead. Prominent Democratic lawmakers and
  legal advocates have called for the new immigration detention camp at Fort
  Bliss military base to be shut down amid accusations of lack of external
  oversight and concerns over access to legal services. Catching up? Here’s what
