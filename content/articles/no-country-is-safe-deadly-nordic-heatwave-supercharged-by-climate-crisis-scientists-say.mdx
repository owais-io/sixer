  scientists say

  The prolonged Nordic heatwave in July was supercharged by the climate crisis
  and shows “no country is safe from climate change”, scientists say. Norway,
  Sweden and Finland have historically cool climates but were hit by soaring
  temperatures, including a record run of 22 days above 30C (86F) in Finland.
  Sweden endured 10 straight days of “tropical nights”, when temperatures did
  not fall below 20C (68F). Global heating, caused by the burning of fossil
  fuels, made the heatwave at least 10 times more likely and 2C hotter, the
  scientists said. Some of the weather data and climate models used in their
  analysis indicated the heatwave would have been impossible without
  human-caused climate breakdown. The heat had widespread effects, with
  hospitals overheating and overcrowding and some forced to cancel planned
  surgery. At least 60 people drowned as outdoor swimming increased, while toxic
  algal blooms flourished in seas and lakes. Hundreds of wildfires burned in
  forests and people were reported fainting at holiday-season events. In the
  last major heatwave in the region, in 2018, 750 people died early in Sweden
  alone, and scientists anticipate a similar toll once the data is processed.
  Wildlife was also affected, especially the Scandinavian peninsula’s famous
  reindeer. Some animals died in the heat and others entered towns seeking
  shade. Drivers were warned that reindeer could seek to cool down in road
  tunnels. Much of the northern hemisphere has experienced heatwaves in recent
  weeks. This includes the UK, Spain and Croatia, where wildfire destruction is
  almost double the 20-year average, and the US, Japan and South Korea.
  Scientists are certain that the climate crisis has intensified this extreme
  weather. Prof Friederike Otto, a climatologist at Imperial College London who
  leads the World Weather Attribution (WWA) collaboration, which did the Nordic
  analysis, said: “Even relatively cold Scandinavian countries are facing
  dangerous heatwaves today with 1.3C of warming – no country is safe from
  climate change. “Burning oil, gas, and coal is killing people today. Fossil
  fuels are supercharging extreme weather and to stop the climate from becoming
  more dangerous, we need to stop burning them and shift to renewable energy.”
  Heatwaves such as the one in Scandinavia will become another five times more
  frequent by 2100 if global heating reaches 2.6C, which is the trajectory
  today. Maja Vahlberg, a Swedish expert at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate
  Centre, said: “This July reminded us that in the north, heat is not a distant
  threat but is seeping into hospitals, care facilities and homes. Our
  infrastructure was not built to withstand these extreme temperatures and our
  ageing population is increasingly susceptible to dangerous heat. “I watched a
  reindeer stay in the same patch of shade for three days straight without
  grazing, a quiet sign of the strain the heat was causing,” she said. The rapid
  WWA study on the role of human-caused global heating in the Nordic heatwave
  compared the likelihood of the high temperatures in today’s hotter climate
  with that in the cooler preindustrial period, focusing on the hottest two-week
  period in each country. It found that even the relatively small 0.2C rise in
  global temperature since 2018 had doubled the chance of such heatwaves,
  showing that every fraction of a degree mattered, the scientists said.
  “Climate change is fundamentally reshaping the world we live in,” said Dr
  Clair Barnes, at Imperial College London. A striking aspect of the heatwaves
  was the number of tropical nights. “At one station in northern Sweden, we had
  10 of these days at the end of July, which is extraordinary,” said Prof Erik
  Kjellström, at the Swedish Meteorological Institute. Amalie Skålevåg, at the
  Norwegian Meteorological Institute, said: “Hot nights can be dangerous when
  the body does not get a chance to rest and recover after a hot day, and this
  is particularly true for people with underlying health conditions.” The
  effects of the heatwave on reindeer threaten the livelihoods of Indigenous
  Sámi communities, which have herded them for more than 1,000 years. “Such
  disruptions also threaten [the Sámi’s] health and their right to sustain a way
  of life – this makes climate change a human rights issue,” said Vahlberg.
