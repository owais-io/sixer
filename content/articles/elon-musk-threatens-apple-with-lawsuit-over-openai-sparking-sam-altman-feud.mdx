  Elon Musk has threatened legal action against Apple on behalf of his
  artificial intelligence startup xAI, accusing the iPhone maker of favoring
  OpenAI and breaching antitrust regulations in managing the rankings in its App
  Store. The posts elicited snide responses from Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and
  began a spat between the two former business partners on X. “Apple is behaving
  in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to
  reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI
  will take immediate legal action,” Musk said in a post on X. In a post earlier
  that day, he wrote: “Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X
  or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and
  Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?” OpenAI’s ChatGPT
  currently holds the top spot in the App Store’s “Top Free Apps” section in the
  US, while xAI’s Grok ranks fifth. Apple has a partnership with OpenAI that
  integrates ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads and Macs. Apple and xAI did not provide
  comment. Altman responded to Musk on X: “This is a remarkable claim given what
  I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his
  own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.” Musk has
  bent X’s algorithmic recommendations to favor his own tweets, according to
  multiple reports. Altman and Musk founded OpenAI together in 2015, but Musk
  left the startup and rescinded funding in 2018 after proposing to take it
  over, a petition other executives rebuffed. Musk has since sued the company
  twice over its planned transition to a for-profit enterprise, alleging “deceit
  of Shakespearean proportions”. Altman has cast Musk as a bitter and petty
  ex-partner who was jealous of the company’s success after departing. Musk
  replied to Altman’s tweet: “You got 3M views on your bullshit post, you liar,
  far more than I’ve received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your
  follower count!” Altman replied to Musk multiple times, first calling his lack
  of views a “skill issue”, then “or bots”, and then offered a legal question of
  his own: “Will you sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to
  the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors or helped your own
  companies? i will apologize if so.” Users on X – through the community notes
  feature – have pointed out that a few apps besides OpenAI have taken the top
  spot on the App Store this year. Chinese AI app DeepSeek reached the No 1 spot
  on the platform in January, while in July, Perplexity took first place in
  India’s App Store – both occurring after the OpenAI and Apple partnership
  struck last year. One user asked X’s native AI, Grok, who was right in the
  feud. The chatbot replied: “Based on verified evidence, Sam Altman is right.”
  Musk’s comments come as regulators and rivals intensify scrutiny of Apple’s
  control over its App Store. Earlier this year, Apple was ordered to pay a fine
  of €500m ($581.15m) by the EU antitrust enforcer, which said the company’s
  restrictions prevented developers from steering users outside the App Store.
  The US Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in early
  2024, accusing the iPhone maker of creating and maintaining “broad, sustained,
  and illegal” smartphone monopoly.
