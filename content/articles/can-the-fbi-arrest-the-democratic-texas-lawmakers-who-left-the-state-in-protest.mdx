  At the insistence of Donald Trump, Republicans in Texas are pushing ahead with
  an effort to redraw their congressional map to pick up as many as five
  additional Republican seats. The decision has set off a cascading legal
  battle. State lawmakers have fled Texas as part of an effort to stop
  Republicans from passing the map. Democrats in other states have said they
  will retaliate, setting the stage for a nasty and prolonged redistricting
  tit-for-tat that could last for years. What is redistricting? After a
  nationwide census every 10 years, all 50 US states are required to redraw
  their congressional districts to account for population shifts. The US
  constitution entrusts the power to draw congressional lines to the state
  legislatures in each state. Since the 18th century, politicians have tried to
  use this line-drawing power to punish their political rivals. In the 19th
  century, the practice of manipulating district lines for political lines
  became known as gerrymandering. While states are required to redistrict every
  10 years, the constitution contains no explicit ban on redrawing boundaries
  before the decade is up. Why is Texas redistricting now? Republicans currently
  hold an extremely slim 219-212 majority in the US House (there are four
  vacancies, three of which are seats previously held by Democrats). Republicans
  know they will probably lose seats in next year’s mid-term elections, when all
  members of the US House will stand for re-election and the sitting president’s
  party typically does not perform well. Republicans have complete control of
  state government in Texas, which has 38 US House seats (second only to
  California’s 52 seats). Republicans currently hold 25 of those seats. Seeking
  to shore up the Republican advantage in the US House, Trump urged the Texas
  governor, Greg Abbott, to redraw the state’s lines to add additional
  Republican-friendly districts. Abbott called a special session to draw the
  districts last month. Last week, Republicans unveiled a map in which they
  could pick up five additional seats, giving them a 30-8 advantage in the
  state’s delegation. Is this legal? Texas also undertook a mid-decade
  redistricting in 2003. In 2006, the US supreme court said that nothing in the
  US constitution prohibited Texas from redrawing its district mid-decade. The
  US supreme court has also given states virtually unlimited leeway to
  gerrymander districts for partisan gain. In a 5-4 decision in 2019, it said
  that federal courts could not do anything to stop the drawing of districts for
  partisan advantage, no matter how severe. There are still legal protections
  that prohibit states from diluting the influence of minority voters when they
  draw districts or explicitly sorting them based on their race. But the supreme
  court has made those cases extremely difficult to win and they can take years
  to resolve in court. Why did Texas Democrats leave the state? Democrats are in
  the minority in the Texas state legislature. But the body’s bylaws require the
  presence of two-thirds of its lawmakers to conduct business. There are 150
  members of the Texas house of representatives, 62 of whom are Democrats. More
  than 51 fled the state on Sunday to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York to
  deny that quorum, halting the legislature from moving forward on the maps.
  This isn’t the first time Democrats have left the state to break quorum to try
  to stop Republicans from passing legislation. In 2021, Democrats fled to
  Washington DC as Republicans were poised to pass sweeping new voting
  restrictions. That standoff lasted several weeks, but Democrats eventually
  returned to the state and the legislation passed. Democrats also fled the
  state in 2003 to try to stop mid-decade redistricting. Can Republicans force
  Democrats to return to Texas? The Texas house voted on Monday to authorize
  arrest warrants for the members who fled the state. Such warrants are unlikely
  to be enforced while the members are out of the state. Abbott and the Texas
  attorney general, Ken Paxton, have pledged to aggressively pursue the
  Democrats. Abbott has cited a 2021 non-binding opinion from Paxton’s office to
  suggest that the lawmakers who broke quorum could be removed from office. But
  such an extraordinary action would need to go through the Texas courts and
  would likely be tied up in state court for some time. Rules enacted by the
  House in 2023 subject state lawmakers to a $500 daily fine for each day they
  are absent. Lawmakers are paid about $600 a month. While the rules prohibit
  lawmakers from using campaign funds to pay the fines, there are loopholes
  Democrats can use to have someone else cover them. The current special
  legislative session runs through 19 August but Abbott can continue to call
  more sessions, and it’s unclear how long Democrats are willing to wait out
  returning. Can the FBI arrest Texas lawmakers who left in protest? US senator
  John Cornyn said on 7 August that the FBI had granted his request “to assist
  Texas law enforcement in locating members of the Texas House of
  Representatives who have fled the state”. The FBI declined to comment on
  Cornyn’s statement. It is unclear what kind of assistance, if any, they will
  be providing. The Texas lawmakers have not hid their location and it is
  well-known that they are staying at a hotel in St Charles, Illinois, outside
  of Chicago. Cornyn cited concerns about bribery in his request for assistance
  to the FBI because Texas Democrats are fundraising and have relied on outside
  groups to fund their effort. But there have been no criminal charges filed
  against them and no warrants issued for their arrest. The Texas House of
  Representatives has issued civil warrants authorizing the chamber’s
  sergeant-at-arms to arrest lawmakers in Texas, but the warrants don’t apply
  outside of state lines. “Federal government intrusion into a state’s process
  of self-government should only occur when there is a clear constitutional
  warrant. In this situation, the federal government has no authority to
  intervene and no legitimate role to play,” said David Froomkin, a law
  professor at the University of Houston. “The Texas constitution assigns to the
  Texas House of Representatives the authority to govern House members’
  attendance and to discipline House members in connection with their
  attendance. The executive and judicial branches of state government should not
  interfere with that legislative authority – and the federal government
  certainly should not.” How are Democrats outside of Texas responding? As Texas
  has moved ahead with its effort to implement a new map, Democrats have
  threatened to retaliate by redrawing districts in states where they have
  complete control. Most notably, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, is
  leading an effort to redraw California’s 52 districts to drastically reduce
  the number of Republican seats (Democrats already hold 43 seats). Democratic
  governors in Illinois and New York have also pledged to retaliate. Democrats
  face significant legal obstacles to achieving this goal. In California, voters
  approved a referendum in 2010 that strips lawmakers of their redistricting
  power and instead hands it to a bipartisan and independent citizens
  commission. Newsom and California Democrats are reportedly moving ahead with a
  plan to have voters approve a new map through a referendum this fall. In New
  York, the state constitution bars mid-decade redistricting absent a court
  order, but Democrats are reportedly considering putting a constitutional
  amendment on the ballot that would allow them to redistrict later in the
  decade. “I’m tired of fighting this fight with my hand tied behind my back,”
  Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, said on Wednesday. Will other
  Republican states redraw their maps? Trump is reportedly urging Republicans in
  Missouri to redraw their congressional map to pick up an additional GOP seat.
  Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, has also suggested that his state, where
  Republicans hold 20 of 28 seats, should redraw districts, which would likely
  lead to additional GOP gains. Ohio, where Republicans hold 10 of 15 seats, is
  required to redraw its map this year because of a unique state law. That is
  likely to also lead to additional Republican seats.
