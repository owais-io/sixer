  Most of our summer beauty fantasies involve outstretched glossy-tanned limbs
  and bright pedicured toes peeping out of sandals. The reality is often less
  glamorous. As we endure a season of hot and humid weather, here and abroad,
  contending with sweat, frizz and clogged pores can be a daily battle. From UV
  rays to air-con, many factors take a toll on hair, skin and nails when the
  mercury shoots up. To know which products to reach for, it’s important to
  understand how each part of our body is affected. Finding an SPF your skin
  loves is also non-negotiable. Get in the habit of reapplying it rigorously and
  regularly (every two hours, or after swimming) while you’re exposed to the
  sun. Check the UV index on your phone’s weather app as a guide: if it’s above
  two, be even more vigilant. Ready for your SOS? From all-star SPFs to
  hydrating hair care, these are the trusted hot-weather beauty buys to know,
  all tried and tested by me. *** The best hair products for hot and humid
  weather *** ‘Sun and heat dehydrate hair and break down the bonds that hold it
  together, which can leave it frizzy and dull or rough in texture,” says
  hairdresser Hadley Yates. Dyed hair is worst hit by warm weather, he adds, as
  “UV rays break down colour pigments and oxidise dye molecules, causing
  fading”. Covering hair as much as possible with a sun hat or scarf –
  especially the fragile ends – is important, as is the use of heat-protection
  products, including those that add moisture back into the hair. Philip
  Kingsley Swimcap water-resistant mask £24 for 100ml at Cult Beauty £25 for
  100ml at Look Fantastic Your hair is like a sponge, so if you’re heading to
  the beach or lido, make sure you at least saturate your locks with clean water
  before a swim. If dry, it will absorb the salty or chlorinated water. Even
  better, apply a mask, such as Philip Kinglsey’s Swimcap, to shield it. It
  doesn’t feel sticky or heavy when applied and will moisturise locks while
  protecting them. Amika Frizz-me-not hydrating anti-frizz treatment £28 for
  200ml at Sephora £28 for 200ml at Cult Beauty Blow-drying in 30C+ heat? No,
  thank you. To get a glossy finish from air drying, pick a product that tackles
  frizz while protecting your locks from the heat. Amika’s lightweight spray
  smells divine and leaves hair soft to the touch. Mist evenly on damp hair for
  best results. Larry King flyaway kit £20 at John Lewis £20 at Liberty If
  you’re prone to flyaways even after using heat protection and serum, then
  stash this kit in your bag. The A Social Life For Your Hair finishing cream is
  lightweight and doesn’t leave a white cast. Warm a little in your fingers and
  run through strays close to the root, or apply to the mini brush provided to
  slick back hair. Ouai Detox shampoo £28 for 300ml at Space NK From £28 for
  300ml at Cult Beauty With sweat, SPF and pollution, your hair and scalp need
  extra help in hot weather to feel squeaky clean, so try using a clarifying
  shampoo once a week to remove all the buildup. This Ouai formula is effective
  without drying out locks. Davines SU hair mask £31 for 150ml at Cosmetify
  Using a moisturising mask once a week can help relieve dehydrated or damaged
  hair. Formulated specifically to mitigate the effects of sun, sea and sand,
  Davines’ cruelty-free SU version can be used in place of conditioner (leave in
  for up to 15 minutes) or applied as sun protection as a longer treatment
  during your session at the beach or pool. Bouclème curl cream £22 for 300ml at
  Look Fantastic £22 for 300ml at Boots If you’re a curly girl, then air drying
  hair with a curl cream will keep it in good shape. I like Bouclème’s hydrating
  formula with coconut fruit extract, castor oil and kukui nut oil; it’s
  lightweight and leaves no tell-tale crispiness once hair is dry. Apply it to
  wet lengths and scrunch upwards in sections to encourage natural texture. ***
  The best skincare for hot weather *** For skin, consultant dermatologist Dr
  Anjali Mahto says you should “prioritise lightweight hydration and gentle
  cleansing to remove sweat and sunscreen buildup without stripping the skin”.
  Fellow skin clinician Pamela Marshall notes that moisturisers with ceramides
  and PHAs help skin stay hydrated, particularly if it’s being parched by an
  air-conditioned office. Drunk Elephant D-Bronzi anti-pollution sunshine drops
  £34 for 30ml at Cult Beauty £34 for 30ml at Look Fantastic If you’re extra
  scrupulous with your face and neck SPF, you might notice they tan less quickly
  than your body. To even things out, pop a few drops of Drunk Elephant’s tanner
  in your moisturiser, or apply it straight on to skin in place of a powder. As
  well as giving a lovely dewy bronze glow, the product contains antioxidants to
  help defend skin against pollution and UV rays. For more, read our guide to
  the best fake tans The Inkey List Hydro-Surge dewy face mist £11 for 75ml at
  Cult Beauty £11 for 75ml at Sephora The Inkey List’s facial spritz is
  formulated to shield your skin barrier while cooling you down, and it’s light
  enough not to disrupt your makeup or SPF. Great to have in your handbag for
  sticky journeys. Ultra Violette Sheen Screen hydrating SPF50 lip balm £17 for
  15g at Sephora £17 for 15g at Cult Beauty Super-high protection and eight
  pretty shades to choose from? What more could you want from an SPF lip balm?
  Ultra Violette’s formulas are cult for a reason, and this balm feels smooth
  and glossy without being sticky. Helpfully, you’ll be reminded to top up when
  the colour has rubbed off. For more, read our guide to the best lip balms Lisa
  Eldridge cleansing and exfoliating cloths £10 for two cloths at Space NK £10
  for two cloths at Lisa Eldridge To get off all that grime, makeup and SPF, you
  should use a clean washcloth with every cleanse. Lisa Eldridge’s reusable,
  washable version has two textures so you can gently remove all traces of
  product with the flannel side and use the other to polish skin. Mecca
  Cosmetica To Save Face SPF50+ matt sun serum £38 for 50ml at Mecca Cosmetica
  Pick a non-comedogenic (meaning it won’t clog pores), broad-spectrum (one that
  protects against UVA and UVB rays) SPF in hot weather. The Guardian’s beauty
  columnist Sali Hughes rates Mecca Cosmetica’s mattifying serum. Always apply
  under makeup so it can bond with clean skin. For more, read Sali Hughes’s
  guide to the best SPFs Refy face sculpt £37.72 for 70ml at Brown Thomas £38
  for 70ml at Refy Refy’s face Sculpt is a multitasking moisturiser that’s great
  for summer. The formula feels rich without being heavy, and is suitable for
  acne-prone skin. The applicator has cooling rollerballs that feel heavenly
  gliding over the face and leave you looking dewy and lifted. Refrigerate
  before use to really reap the benefits. *** The best makeup for hot weather
  *** ‘It’s all about lightweight, long-wear textures that fuse with the skin,”
  says makeup artist Ruby Hammer. Think gel-based formulas or cream-to-powder
  foundation, and run a mile from anything heavy. “Keep the skin fresh, the
  textures light, and let a little dewiness shine through – it’s part of the
  look, not a flaw,” she says. Erborian CC Water lightweight tinted gel £19 for
  15ml at John Lewis £38 for 40ml at Look Fantastic The “water” version of
  Erborian’s viral CC Cream adds weightless coverage and colour. The bubble-like
  gel formula turns to cream when blended, adding just the right amount of
  dewiness while cooling down the skin. Start with a tiny amount, wait until
  it’s settled, then top up in places that need more attention. L’Oréal Paris
  Panorama mascara in black £12.99 at Boots £12.99 at Superdrug As well as
  drying out your lashes, I find waterproof mascaras claggy and the removal a
  pain. My mascara of choice in a heatwave is L’Oréal’s Panorama, which is
  smudge- and transfer-proof. Its separating and lengthening applicator makes
  eyes look wide awake: ideal when high temperatures are keeping you up at
  night. For more, read our guide to the best mascaras Supergoop!’s Unseen
  sunscreen stick SPF30 £27 for 20g at Space NK £27 for 20g at Cult Beauty Small
  areas of skin prone to sweat or that are extra sensitive may need more SPF
  top-ups throughout the day – and this Supergoop stick allows you to easily do
  it on the go. It’s perfect for everything – hairline, parting, tops of ears,
  tattoos, lips, nose, you name it. Tatcha Aburatorigami blotting papers £15 for
  40 sheets at Sephora £15 for 40 sheets at Tatcha These are makeup artists’
  secret weapon to ensure products settle on the skin by lifting off excess oil.
  “Don’t underestimate the power of blotting papers – they’re a handbag
  essential,” says Hammer. The Tatcha ones are ideal for sensitive complexions,
  made with just two ingredients. Remember: dab, don’t wipe. Anastasia Beverly
  Hills Magic Touch blush trio £27.75 for 9g at Beauty Bay £37 for 9g at Sephora
  I adore a bit of blush as a quick pick-me-up, and this trio of vivid gel-like
  shades add a lovely, buildable pop of colour. Pat on to the high points of
  cheeks, a little across the forehead and on the bridge of the nose. They blend
  into skin beautifully with the heat of fingers. Nars Total Seduction eye
  shadow stick £28 at John Lewis £28 at Nars If you need a flash of colour on
  the eyes, then a cream formula won’t crease or smudge in high temperatures.
  Blend quickly to allow it to set. This Nars formula comes in eight shimmery
  and eight matt shades. *** The best summer body care products *** Skin on the
  body may feel particularly tight or dehydrated due to sweat evaporating. “This
  can also exacerbate conditions such as rosacea or heat rash,” says consultant
  dermatologist Mahto. It’s recommended to have tepid showers over cold ones (to
  reduce the chance of reactivity) and use a light moisturisers afterwards.
  Diptyque L’Eau des Hespérides eau de toilette £135 for 100ml at Diptyque A
  light, refreshing scent can be a real mood-lifter when it’s hot and humid.
  Diptyque’s Greece-inspired eau de toilette has notes of zesty bitter orange
  and lemon with spicy undertones, giving a bit of holiday feeling even if
  you’re not island-hopping in the Cyclades. Estrid refillable antiperspirant
  £9.56 for 40ml at Boots £13.95 for 40ml at Estrid Estrid’s refillable roll-on
  has been keeping me fresh through the summer commute, and I adore the clean
  laundry-like Wave scent. The serum formula dries quickly on skin and has
  ingredients such as noni fruit compound to help keep your armpits’ microbiome
  balanced, which in turn controls odour and skin irritation. Kiko Milano
  aftersun shower gel £12.99 for 200ml at Debenhams £10.40 for 200ml at Amazon
  Kiko’s aftersun shower gel feels cooling and soothing on the skin. It’s
  boosted with hydrating hyaluronic acid and brightening prickly pear extract to
  treat skin while effectively sloughing away the day. It’s a wonder that
  in-shower aftersuns aren’t more of a thing. Alpha-H Daily Dose multivitamin
  body serum £27.99 for 150ml at Cult Beauty £28 for 150ml at Space NK It’s
  natural to reach for a rich moisturiser when skin feels dry, but as clinical
  aesthetician Pamela Marshall says, “heavier moisturisers are more cosseting
  and not necessarily more hydrating.” Alpha-H’s Daily Dose does an excellent
  job of quenching skin, is easily absorbed and boosted with vitamin C,
  hyaluronic acid and niacinamide to brighten skin and protect its barrier,
  while still feeling light. Vichy Capital Soleil hydrating solar protective
  water £17.20 for 200ml at Look Fantastic £17.20 for 200ml at Boots An SPF that
  you want to apply is the holy grail. Guardian columnist Sali Hughes waxes
  lyrical about this spray formula, which gives skin a flattering golden tone
  while protecting it from the sun. Who doesn’t love a multitasker? Swiish
  Recharge hydration + electrolytes £34.95 for 20 sachets at Swiish Aussie brand
  Swiish recently touched down in the UK with its science-backed, multitasking
  supplements. Chuck one of its electrolyte sachets in your water bottle daily
  to replenish those lost through sweating and give you a much-needed energy
  boost. The subtle mango flavour is moreish. Sun Bum Original SPF50 sunscreen
  lotion £16.79 for 237ml at Look Fantastic £20.99 for 237ml at Cult Beauty
  Moisturising, easily absorbed and high factor – this family-friendly SPF
  checks off the holy trinity of wants from daily sun protection. It’s also
  suitable for sensitive skin. *** How to care for your feet in hot weather ***
  Summer can be a tricky time for feet, either trapped in shoes with heat and
  moisture buildup or exposed to the elements in sandals. “This creates the
  perfect environment for issues such as fungal infections, sweating and
  friction-related problems such as blisters,” says podiatrist Margaret Dabbs,
  “while sun, saltwater and sandals lead to dryness, cracking and nail
  discoloration.” It’s important to give your feet TLC in the evenings or
  clinical care to keep them looking their best. Beauty Pie Footopia super foot
  file £18 at Beauty Pie If sun, sea, sand or city life has dried out your feet,
  slough away hard skin with a high-quality file such as Beauty Pie’s, which has
  a nice solid ergonomic handle. File feet only when they’re dry to ensure you
  know exactly how much skin you’re taking off. Margaret Dabbs Miracle foot
  cream £22 for 100ml at Victoria Health £22 for 100ml at Amazon Follow up with
  a nourishing and hydrating foot cream at bedtime so it can work its magic
  while you sleep. Margaret Dabbs’ formula isn’t greasy and has antifungal
  benefits. Kuou gel socks £10.99 for three pairs at Amazon These gel-heel socks
  come recommended by Sali Hughes and are a great solution for locking in balm
  or moisturiser overnight, so you wake up minus telltale sandal-foot symptoms.
  Sleep in them about three times a week for best results. *** Hayley Spencer is
