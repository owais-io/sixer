  That’s it from Salford, comrades. Stay tuned for a match report from the
  Guardian team and tune in tomorrow for more of the 2025 Women’s Rugby World
  Cup! Massive confidence boost for the Australians to not only sciore 73-points
  but also hold Samoa to zip. Great performances from all the Wallaroos but
  Cecelia Smith has been awarded Player of the Match, a great honour for the
  star from the Leeton Dianas. Samoa didn’t challenge as we thought they might
  but we are now seeing them arm-in-arm in a ring with the Australians
  post-match and there are smiles all round. Beautiful scenes as Emily
  Chancellor speaks to the assembly and brings tears to the eyes of many. Lovely
  camaraderie from the Oceania sisters! 80th minute: Last throw of the dice for
  Samoa… but BANG! Lori Cramer’s piledriver tackle shuts down any hope of a try
  for Samoa. That’s all, folks. The siren blows on a comprehensive win for
  Australia. At 73-0, it falls short of the Wallaroo’s 87-point walloping of
  Samoa in 2010 but I think coach Jo Yapp will be happy with the night’s work. A
  fantastic start to the campaign for the women in gold. Halse has a double too!
  That came off a brilliant run by Piper Duck who fended on her right before
  offloading on the left. Australia hit 70 points as Lori Cramer’s conversion
  makes it a 73-point shellacking. So far. Bad news for Melina Grace Salale
  whose yellow card has been upgraded to a red after review by the TMO. That’s
  terrible news for Samoa’s tournament. Talakai has a double! That was sweet
  revenge for the heavy hit on Miller who has left the field for an HIA and been
  replaced by Caitlyn Halse. Lori Cramer is doing the kicking for Australia and
  she slots it. 73rd minute: Another yellow card for Samoa as high contact on
  Desiree Miller gets punished. It’s young Melina Grace Salale who must leave
  the field and fret over whether she has further charges to answer. Miller is
  up from the collision but seems stunned. Give her an early shower, Ms Yapp!
  With three tries in the first half, she’s earned it. 71st minute: Samoa aren’t
  done yet! They go left through the hands and Australia have to rush up to
  snuff the chance. They do it as again, butter fingers cost Samoa possession.
  Australia clear but lovely work on the sideline by fullback Karla Wright
  Akeli, who caught, spun and tappedback in one svelte motion, keeps the kick
  infield Australia have another! This time it’s the hooker Adiana Talakai
  crossing the stripe off the back of another powerful rolling maul from the
  Wallaroos. 65th minute: Lovely bust by the Wallaroos and Desi Miller, as
  always, is in support. Unfortunately her inside ball is jolted a tad forward
  in the tackle and it’s too much for Cecelia Smith to handle. Great hit by
  replacement Jayjay Taylor to snuff that break. Ash Fernandez is on the field
  for Australia and she wins her first lineout throw. Here come the Wallaroos!
  63rd minute: Australia’s Layne Morgan has sprayed her clearing kick and that
  sets up Samoa with a lineout 10-metres out from the line. Tori Iosefo is on
  the field and she barrels upfield with a powerful run. Her teammates go with
  her but they’re too slow to this collision and Georgina Friedrichs has stolen
  for the Wallaroos. Great stuff by the veteran but Australia are still pinned
  in their own half. 60th minute: Samoa have been much better this half and are
  pulling together nice phases. But with an hour gone, they are still hunting
  first points in their first WRWC tournament. Australia have revamped their
  starting side and emptied the bench and it’s disrupted their patterns. That’s
  allowed the women in blue to get some much-needed momentum. Here comes a fresh
  raid… but Australia have stolen again! 57th minute: Samoa’s captain Sui
  Pauaraisa, with her distinctive mane of white hair, is doing her darnedest to
  inspire her team. She snipes off the ruck and makes a few metres, standing in
  the tackle until support arrives. Her strength is enough to pressure
  Australia’s Layne Morgan into a mistake. Samoa win the penalty and have the
  scrum feed on halfway. Cecelia Smith is over the line and Australia have their
  half-century! That’s a bittersweet moment for Smith who has rich Samoan
  heritage and fans on both sides in the crowd. But she set up the score with a
  brave charge inside the 22 and she gets to ice her hard work by scoring
  Australia’s first of the second half. Yapp is shaking uyp her backline with
  replacements now. Faitala Moleka and Caitlyn Halse are off for Australia and
  Tia Hinds and Layne Morgan are on. 51st minute: Talakai is making the most of
  those fresh legs. She barges her way inside the red zone with Brianna Hoy on
  her hip. They get ov er the stripe but are held up. Samoa will drop kick their
  way out of trouble. But Tabua Tuinakauvadra is ALL trouble. The big No 8 from
  the Orange Emus gets the Wallaroos back in the red zone… 46th minute: Jo Yapp
  is ringing the changes for Australia. Looks like The Bomb Squad is on with an
  all-new frontrow. Brianna Hoy is on the field alongside Bridie O’Gorman and
  Adiana Talakai. That’s a lot of size, experience and energy to kill off the
  Samoan threat. Talakai nails her first lineout throw and Australia are
  rumbling over halfway again. 45th minute: That was a try-saving tackle by
  Halse to jar the ball loose on that last play. But Samoa still have the throw
  into the lineout. They’re only 5m out now but Australia have stolenthe
  lineout! Karpani atones for that penalty by spinning out of the tackle with
  the ball. Moleka clears for the Wallaroos and Samoa charge back into contact.
  43rd minute: Here come Samoa! Australia are rushing up to defend their line
  but the blue maul is inching closer. Another penalty advantage for a high
  tackle against Australia but the Samoans want this try. Have they got it? No
  they’ve lost it over the line! 43rd minute: Ana Afuie makes a lovely weaving
  run for Samoa. She’s won the penalty but continues to snipe until Duck brings
  her down. We’ll got back for the Kapani infringement though and Samoa kick it
  to the corner and go to their lineout 5m out. 41st minute: Here we go with the
  second half… Samoa to kick off. Their fans are roaring support. But
  Australia’s Piper Duck carries strongly to the 40m line and Halse clears.
  Samoa will be on the attack inside half-way. Australian rugby fan’s are having
  a great night and it gets bigger (and hopefully better) when the Wallabies
  take on the Springboks at 1.10am AEST. I won’t be calling that one – Dan
  Gallen will be ringside for the Guardian from 12.30am – but I did have a
  rummage through the history books during the week and discover that Joe
  Schmidt’s men have a rare chance to match the fabled 1963 Wallabies side by
  defeating the men from the veldt back-to-back. That was a very hot half-hour
  by Australia! They scored a swag of tries with teamwork and individual
  brilliance with crowed-favourite winger Desiree Miller getting a first-half
  hat-trick in her Rugby World Cup debut. The Wallaroos weren’t perfect and
  Samoa started to find some momentum late in the half. But nerves have
  scuppered their game plan and their discipline has been woeful, with simple
  mistakes and fumbles handing the ball back to an Australian side who have
  punished every error. For their fan’s sake let’s hope Samoa can turn it around
  in the second half. 39th minute: Bizarre scenes as the ball goes MIA and then
  two pills appear from either side. The delay has given the TMO time to find
  dangerous play against Samoa in the previous attacking raid. “Dangerous
  cleanout”, says the ref. Australia win the penalty and Samoa have squandered
  their best chance of the match so far. 37th minute: Samoa finally get a chance
  inside the Wallaroos quarter, forcing a lineout. They win it and go right
  through Ana Mamea who is back on the field after her yellow card. Australia’s
  Karpani infringes at the ruck and Samoa play on quickly. The crowd are on
  their feet now. They want the Samoans to get a sniff of hope before halftime.
  Here they come, phase after phase… one metre out now…. Miller gets her
  hat-trick! She and her fellow winger Maya Stewart looped around to the right
  and outflanked the Samoans. Miller made the initial bust before finding her No
  14 in support but the powerful winger stayed on her hip all the way and when
  the final tackle came on Stewart, she was there to take the inside ball. Wood
  continues her sweet night off the tee and slots the conversion. 30th minute:
  Samoa are playing catchup footy, going wide in side their own quarter. This
  time the long pass from Fa’asua Makisi to her winger Falanik is telegraphed by
  the Australians as Maya Stewart does what the Nelson Bay Gropers taught her in
  the early days and gobbles her up in a flash. 26th minute: A rare mistake by
  Australia as a kick for touch goes long. But again Samoa err in return with a
  fumble from the base of the maul. They need to lift their discipline in a
  hurry or Australia could hit the half-century by halftime. Desi doubles up!
  That came from a brilliant turnover on halfway which Cecilia Smith turned in
  to a break Halse seized on, spinning it left to Georgina Friedrichs who
  shovelled it straight to Miller who put her head down, set the pig tails
  flying and sprinted for the corner and Australia’s sixth try. Australia’s maul
  is rocking and rolling and again it closes ranks and rattles downfield at
  speed. Eva Karpani can’t be stopped – she crosses for yet another try. That
  was the 13th try in gold for the Southern Suburbs legend who is in her 38th
  Test. Wood kicks a nice conversion from outside the right post to make it a
  33-point margin. To make matters worse, Samoa’s Ana Mamea has been
  yellow-carded for being offside in that rearguard action. Samoa down to 14 for
  the next 10 minutes! 18th minute: Finally, some signs of life from the
  Samoans! This time it’s frontrowers Ana Mamea and Avau Filimaua splitting the
  gold line and ripping upfield in tandem. Lovely short ball work between the
  two but eventually Australia stop bouncing off the runners and bring them to
  ground. Direct, physical, enterprising – that’s what Samoa can do! Emily
  Chancellor scores for Australia! Wonderful moment for the skipper from the
  Sydney University Club in her 31st Test. Australia are controlling territory,
  playing patiently and ruthlessly. Samoa, in their first World Cup, are in
  total shock. 13th minute: The mouthguard of Samoa’s Sinead Ryder is flashing
  red and that means the technology has detected heavy G-forces to the head.
  Fascinating device that could revolutionise the game. Right now the
  revolutions are all with the women in gold as Eva Karpani rumbles it upfield
  and Piper Duck scoots around the ruck. Michaela Leonard charges for the line
  but is held up a metre short. Can the captain do better? Halse is over! A flat
  ball from Moleka and she speareed through the defensive line, fended one and
  dived through the tackle of another to score Australia’s third try. Great
  effort from the young Camden Rams prodigy in her 12th Test. Samantha Wood adds
  the extras from just outside the right post. Wallaroos on fire early! 8th
  minute: Powerful carries from the kickoff get Australia over the advantage
  line, but it ends in a Wallaroos lineout 22 metres out which is stolen by
  Samoa. That will lift them. But the Wallaroos have a rush defence which isn’t
  giving an inch. Samoa captain Sui Pauaraisa picks and drives but is rocked by
  heavy defence and Australia have the steal… Desi does it again! The pig tailed
  winger crosses in the corner after fast hands to the left. Halse probably
  could have crossed herself but offloaded for Miller in space. Australia are
  off to a fast start here and Samoa have to settle things down or risk a
  cricket score. 4th minute: More great play by Australia as Caitlyn Halse rips
  a fast ball out to pocket rocket winger Desiree Miller. She shimmies and
  shakes but can’t get far. Australia have to settle for a lineout 20m out from
  the Samoa line Lovely lineout win by the Wallaroos and they shift in to a
  rolling maul that thunders upfield for Katalina Amosa to crash over for the
  try of Australia’s campaign! Great try from the Southern Districts hooker in
  her seventh Test… and they add the extras. 1st minute: High emotion for both
  sides during the anthems with the tears falling freely. Australia’s Faitala
  Moleka kicks us underway and straight away Samoa have erred, fumbling the kick
  and giving Australia an early glimpse of the line. Here we go, folks. Players
  from both sides are on the field and anthems are underway. First, a rousing
  version of Advance Australia Fair and now… It’s a cloudy day in Salford but
  skies are clear and the forecasters don’t predict rain. That should make for a
  fast and entertaining game, with both these sides loving to throw caution to
  the wind with their attack. The crowd is starting to trickle in for this game
  and the Scotland-Wales clash to follow. There’s a festive atmosphere in
  Salford town I’m told, with Manchester also humming with the energy of the
  Manchester City-Tottenham Hotspur game and the Pride Parade. Rob Kitson is
  home from covering the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia and,
  clearly still energised from the pint of Guinness I slid in to his mitt a
  fortnight back, found the time to run the rule over what can be a historic
  tournament for global rugby. Australia and Samoa find themselves in the “pool
  of death” headed by England – the world’s No 1 side and the favourites for
  this tournament – and the dangerous USA. If you’re following the form, here’s
  the Guardian’s definitive guide to how the 2025 pools are arranged… Women’s
  rugby is on the rise and with Australia primed to host the 2029 Women’s RWC,
  Jack Snape believes the sport is on the cusp of something special… This World
  Cup kicked off a few hours ago with England’s Red Roses ensuring the host
  nation extended a warm welcome to the USA. Both Australia and Samoa will have
  been watching this game closely as they share a pool with both sides. SAMOA

  Wallaroos, joining back-rower Emily Chancellor in sharing the captaincy duties
  tonight. Greetings sports fans! Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the
  Women’s Rugby World Cup pool match between Australia and Samoa at Salford
  Stadium in Manchester. On paper, tonight’s match is the world No 6 against the
  team ranked No 15 in the world. These two nations have met once in a Test, way
  back in 2010, and Australia racked up an 87-0 victory! But World Cups aren’t
  won on paper and that was then and this is now. After smashing Wales at their
  last start, the Wallaroos may start favourite tonight. But the No 9-ranked
  Wales also stole the first Test of that series from the Wallaroos and Samoa
  have the firepower to cause an upset tonight and in the first round of a Rugby
  World Cup anything can happen. “We know Samoa will be a tough, physical side
  and we need to match it with them,” coach Jo Yapp told media yesterday. “There
  are no second chances at a World Cup and for us it starts with a good
  performance in our first match and building from there.” Indeed. Wallaroos
  coach Yapp has included 13 players with previous World Cup experience for what
  are her final Tests at the helm of Australia’s women’s rugby side. However,
  she has also rolled the dice on youth with fullback Caitlyn Halse set to
  become the youngest Australian to ever play at a Women’s Rugby World Cup.
  Already the youngest player to ever debut for Australia, the 18-year-old will
  eclipse the previous World Cup record set by Millie Boyle in 2017 (19 years 82
  days) when she runs out tonight. In fact, Halse is among 10 Wallaroos players
  debuting at this World Cup. Kick off tonight is 9pm AEST (11am GMT). We’ll be
  back with the teams shortly.

Australian rugby fan’s are having a great night and it gets bigger (and hopefully better) when the Wallabies take on the Springboks at 1.10am AEST. I won’t be calling that one – Dan Gallen will be ringside for the Guardian from 12.30am – but I did have a rummage through the history books during the week and discover that Joe Schmidt’s men have a rare chance to match the fabled 1963 Wallabies side by defeating the men from the veldt back-to-back.

But nerves have scuppered their game plan and their discipline has been woeful, with simple mistakes and fumbles handing the ball back to an Australian side who have punished every error. For their fan’s sake let’s hope Samoa can turn it around in the second half. 39th minute: Bizarre scenes as the ball goes MIA and then two pills appear from either side. The delay has given the TMO time to find dangerous play against Samoa in the previous attacking raid. “Dangerous cleanout”, says the ref. Australia win the penalty and Samoa have squandered their best chance of the match so far. 37th minute: Samoa finally get a chance inside the Wallaroos quarter, forcing a lineout. They win it and go right through Ana Mamea who is back on the field after her yellow card. Australia’s Karpani infringes at the ruck and Samoa play on quickly. The crowd are on their feet now. They want the Samoans to get a sniff of hope before halftime. Here they come, phase after phase… one metre out now…. Miller gets her hat-trick! She and her fellow winger Maya Stewart looped around to the right and outflanked the Samoans. Miller made the initial bust before finding her No 14 in support but the powerful winger stayed on her hip all the way and when the final tackle came on Stewart, she was there to take the inside ball. Wood continues her sweet night off the tee and slots the conversion. 30th minute: Samoa are playing catchup footy, going wide in side their own quarter. This time the long pass from Fa’asua Makisi to her winger Falanik is telegraphed by the Australians as Maya Stewart does what the Nelson Bay Gropers taught her in the early days and gobbles her up in a flash. 26th minute: A rare mistake by Australia as a kick for touch goes long. But again Samoa err in return with a fumble from the base of the maul. They need to lift their discipline in a hurry or Australia could hit the half-century by halftime. Desi doubles up! That came from a brilliant turnover on halfway which Cecilia Smith turned in to a break Halse seized on, spinning it left to Georgina Friedrichs who shovelled it straight to Miller who put her head down, set the pig tails flying and sprinted for the corner and Australia’s sixth try. Australia’s maul is rocking and rolling and again it closes ranks and rattles downfield at speed. Eva Karpani can’t be stopped – she crosses for yet another try. That was the 13th try in gold for the Southern Suburbs legend who is in her 38th Test. Wood kicks a nice conversion from outside the right post to make it a 33-point margin. To make matters worse, Samoa’s Ana Mamea has been yellow-carded for being offside in that rearguard action. Samoa down to 14 for the next 10 minutes! 18th minute: Finally, some signs of life from the Samoans! This time it’s frontrowers Ana Mamea and Avau Filimaua splitting the gold line and ripping upfield in tandem. Lovely short ball work between the two but eventually Australia stop bouncing off the runners and bring them to ground. Direct, physical, enterprising – that’s what Samoa can do! Emily Chancellor scores for Australia! Wonderful moment for the skipper from the Sydney University Club in her 31st Test. Australia are controlling territory, playing patiently and ruthlessly. Samoa, in their first World Cup, are in total shock. 13th minute: The mouthguard of Samoa’s Sinead Ryder is flashing red and that means the technology has detected heavy G-forces to the head. Fascinating device that could revolutionise the game. Right now the revolutions are all with the women in gold as Eva Karpani rumbles it upfield and Piper Duck scoots around the ruck. Michaela Leonard charges for the line but is held up a metre short. Can the captain do better? Halse is over! A flat ball from Moleka and she speareed through the defensive line, fended one and dived through the tackle of another to score Australia’s third try. Great effort from the young Camden Rams prodigy in her 12th Test. Samantha Wood adds the extras from just outside the right post. Wallaroos on fire early! 8th minute: Powerful carries from the kickoff get Australia over the advantage line, but it ends in a Wallaroos lineout 22 metres out which is stolen by Samoa. That will lift them. But the Wallaroos have a rush defence which isn’t giving an inch. Samoa captain Sui Pauaraisa picks and drives but is rocked by heavy defence and Australia have the steal… Desi does it again! The pig tailed winger crosses in the corner after fast hands to the left. Halse probably could have crossed herself but offloaded for Miller in space. Australia are off to a fast start here and Samoa have to settle things down or risk a cricket score. 4th minute: More great play by Australia as Caitlyn Halse rips a fast ball out to pocket rocket winger Desiree Miller. She shimmies and shakes but can’t get far. Australia have to settle for a lineout 20m out from the Samoa line Lovely lineout win by the Wallaroos and they shift in to a rolling maul that thunders upfield for Katalina Amosa to crash over for the try of Australia’s campaign! Great try from the Southern Districts hooker in her seventh Test… and they add the extras. 1st minute: High emotion for both sides during the anthems with the tears falling freely. Australia’s Faitala Moleka kicks us underway and straight away Samoa have erred, fumbling the kick and giving Australia an early glimpse of the line. Here we go, folks. Players from both sides are on the field and anthems are underway. First, a rousing version of Advance Australia Fair and now… It’s a cloudy day in Salford but skies are clear and the forecasters don’t predict rain. That should make for a fast and entertaining game, with both these sides loving to throw caution to the wind with their attack. The crowd is starting to trickle in for this game and the Scotland-Wales clash to follow. There’s a festive atmosphere in Salford town I’m told, with Manchester also humming with the energy of the Manchester City-Tottenham Hotspur game and the Pride Parade. Rob Kitson is home from covering the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia and, clearly still energised from the pint of Guinness I slid in to his mitt a fortnight back, found the time to run the rule over what can be a historic tournament for global rugby. Australia and Samoa find themselves in the “pool of death” headed by England – the world’s No 1 side and the favourites for this tournament – and the dangerous USA. If you’re following the form, here’s the Guardian’s definitive guide to how the 2025 pools are arranged… Women’s rugby is on the rise and with Australia primed to host the 2029 Women’s RWC, Jack Snape believes the sport is on the cusp of something special… This World Cup kicked off a few hours ago with England’s Red Roses ensuring the host nation extended a warm welcome to the USA. Both Australia and Samoa will have been watching this game closely as they share a pool with both sides.

Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Women’s Rugby World Cup pool match between Australia and Samoa at Salford Stadium in Manchester. On paper, tonight’s match is the world No 6 against the team ranked No 15 in the world. These two nations have met once in a Test, way back in 2010, and Australia racked up an 87-0 victory! But World Cups aren’t won on paper and that was then and this is now. After smashing Wales at their last start, the Wallaroos may start favourite tonight. But the No 9-ranked Wales also stole the first Test of that series from the Wallaroos and Samoa have the firepower to cause an upset tonight and in the first round of a Rugby World Cup anything can happen. “We know Samoa will be a tough, physical side and we need to match it with them,” coach Jo Yapp told media yesterday. “There are no second chances at a World Cup and for us it starts with a good performance in our first match and building from there.” Indeed. Wallaroos coach Yapp has included 13 players with previous World Cup experience for what are her final Tests at the helm of Australia’s women’s rugby side. However, she has also rolled the dice on youth with fullback Caitlyn Halse set to become the youngest Australian to ever play at a Women’s Rugby World Cup. Already the youngest player to ever debut for Australia, the 18-year-old will eclipse the previous World Cup record set by Millie Boyle in 2017 (19 years 82 days) when she runs out tonight. In fact, Halse is among 10 Wallaroos players debuting at this World Cup. Kick off tonight is 9pm AEST (11am GMT). We’ll be back with the teams shortly.
