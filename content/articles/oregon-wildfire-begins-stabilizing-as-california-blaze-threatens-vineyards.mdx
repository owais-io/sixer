  A wildfire that destroyed four homes in central Oregon has started to
  stabilize, while a blaze in northern California wine country has so far spared
  some of the state’s most famous vineyards. Moisture helped the 1,200
  firefighters battling Oregon’s Flat fire, but more work needed to be done,
  authorities said. Dry, hot weather had fueled a rapid expansion of the blaze
  across rugged terrain in Deschutes and Jefferson counties since the fire began
  late on Thursday. “Gotta love mother nature. It brought in a little bit of
  rain. Cooled the temps, relative humidity came up,” Travis Medema, the state’s
  chief deputy state fire marshal, told a community meeting in the town of
  Sisters on Monday. “The incident, for the first time in the last three days,
  is really beginning to stabilize.” Officials said firefighters had protective
  lines of some sort around the entire fire, including roads, but the fire
  remained at 5% containment. Authorities at one point ordered evacuations for
  more than 4,000 homes but lifted orders for some areas on Monday. A heat
  advisory was in place through Wednesday, and forecasters warned that potential
  thunderstorms could create erratic winds that would challenge firefighters.
  Meanwhile, the Pickett fire in northern California has charred about 10 sq
  miles (26 sq km) of remote Napa county, known for its hundreds of wineries. It
  was 15% contained on Tuesday. Flames spared the home and adjacent vineyards of
  Jayson Woodbridge of Hundred Acre Wines, but he said it was a close call on
  Thursday when the fire broke out and raced along nearby slopes. He and his son
  grabbed hoses and futilely began spraying down the steep hillsides. “The water
  was evaporating as fast as we were spraying it out there,” Woodbridge said.
  “It was just a hot funnel of air. Fire was just engulfing everything.” Before
  long, crews with bulldozers and air support arrived to protect the property.
  Water-dropping helicopters continued their flights on Monday, keeping the
  flames contained to canyons about 80 miles (130km) north of San Francisco.
  With about a month to go before harvest, Woodbridge said his grapes would not
  be damaged because of the “pure luck” of wind direction. “The smoke won’t
  affect the fruit because the wind’s coming in from the west, thankfully,”
  Woodbridge said. That wasn’t the case in 2020 when toxic smoke from the Glass
  fire caused Woodbridge and other wineries to scrap much of that year’s crop.
  There have been no reports of damage to any vineyards from the Pickett fire,
  said Michelle Novi with Napa Valley Vintners, a non-profit trade association.
  Firefighting resources have been put in place to protect wineries, especially
  as winds pick up, according to the California department of forestry and fire
  protection, or Cal Fire. “With the weather over the last 48 hours, we’re
  seeing high temperatures, low humidity paired with some increasing wind in the
  late afternoon, which was giving our troops some additional work on the
  eastern side of this incident,” a Cal Fire spokesperson, Curtis Rhodes, told
  the Associated Press on Monday. Meanwhile, in south-west Montana, a
  60-year-old contract firefighter died on Sunday afternoon from a cardiac
  emergency while battling the Bivens Creek fire. Ruben Gonzales Romero was
  among more than 700 firefighters working on the lightning-caused fire in the
  Tobacco Root Mountains about 15 miles north of Virginia City, Montana. The
  Bivens Creek fire has burned approximately 3.5 sq miles since 13 August in a
  remote area with thick timber and numerous dead trees. Residents of the
  western US have been sweltering in a heatwave that hospitalized some people,
  with temperatures hitting dangerous levels throughout the weekend in
  Washington, Oregon, southern California, Nevada and Arizona. After a weekend
  of triple-digit temperatures, authorities in Multnomah county, Oregon, said
  they were investigating the death of a 56-year-old man as possibly
  heat-related. The area of the Oregon fire is in a high desert climate, where
  dried grasses and juniper trees are burning and fire is racing through
  tinder-dry canyon areas where i is challenging to create containment lines,
  said the Deschutes county sheriff’s spokesperson, Jason Carr. In central
  California, the state’s largest blaze this year, the Gifford fire, was at 95%
  containment on Tuesday morning after charring nearly 206 sq miles of dry brush
  in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties since erupting on 1 August. The
  cause is under investigation. Although it is difficult to directly tie a
  single fire or weather event directly to climate change, scientists say
  human-caused warming from burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas is causing
  more intense heatwaves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more
  destructive wildfires.
