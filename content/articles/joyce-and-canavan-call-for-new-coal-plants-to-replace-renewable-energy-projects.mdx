  Barnaby Joyce and other leading opponents of net zero by 2050 want Australia
  to build new coal-fired power plants, focus on gas and nuclear energy and
  abandon all efforts to cut carbon emissions. As the former Nationals leader
  pushes a private member’s bill to block net zero – sparking new divisions
  within the Liberals and Nationals this week – he said any long-term emissions
  reduction from renewables would not make a meaningful difference to the
  climate and would cost households too much. “If you want net zero, then
  nuclear can give you net zero at a vastly more affordable rate than
  intermittents [renewable energy],” Joyce told Guardian Australia, arguing
  countries including China were not cutting emissions. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email “I absolutely disagree – if the rest of the world’s not doing it,
  if it has no global effect, then it’s a self-written economic suicide note.”
  China’s emissions dipped for the first time in 2025, down 1% from their peak,
  amid huge government investments in renewables projects. The country is the
  world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also the world’s biggest
  supplier and installer of clean energy technology. The share of coal in
  China’s power mix has dropped to the lowest level since 2016, to just over
  50%. Joyce’s bill is scheduled for debate in August when parliament returns
  for another sitting fortnight. The Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan
  is leading the party’s review of net zero policies in the wake of the 3 May
  election. He said Australia should build new coal-fired power stations, like
  developments happening in China, the US, India and Indonesia. “I think we
  should put Australians first because nothing we do is going to change any
  temperature of the globe one iota by not building a coal-fired power station,”
  Canavan said. “But if we do build some new cheap coal-fired power stations, we
  just may save manufacturing jobs in this country, bring down the cost of
  energy and bring down the cost of everyday goods for Australians.” According
  to the CSIRO’s 2024-25 GenCost report, renewables, firmed by gas and backed by
  transmission, remain the cheapest new form of electricity generation
  technology. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said on Thursday the
  party would have a settled position within “a couple of months”. Net zero
  underpins Australia’s participation in the Paris climate agreement.
  Independent authorities, including the CSIRO, say failing to stem carbon
  emissions will lead to changes in weather including extreme heat, heavy
  rainfall, coastal inundation, bushfires and drought, while exacerbating health
  and wellbeing problems and causing destruction of ecosystems and species.
  Joyce has teamed up with his former rival and another ex-Nationals leader,
  Michael McCormack. McCormack said emissions should not be curbed at the
  expense of manufacturing, farming or food supply. “By constructing tens of
  thousands of kilometres of transmission lines across rural and regional
  Australia in pursuit of a false ideology, the government is industrialising
  fertile rural farmland on a massive scale,” he said. During their 48-hour
  split with the Liberals in May, the Nationals included nuclear energy policy
  as a key demand for reuniting the Coalition. Many of the opponents of net zero
  are advocates for nuclear being included in Australia’s energy supply. The
  shadow energy and emissions reductions minister, Dan Tehan, confirmed this
  week his review for the Liberal party would take nine to 12 months. “The key
  focus between now and Christmas is going to be on gas,” he said in a press
  conference with the opposition leader, Sussan Ley. “We need to bring more gas
  on to the system, but also we need to explore carbon capture and storage.”
  Coalition frontbencher Andrew Hastie helped win support for an anti-net zero
  motion at last weekend’s Western Australia Liberal state conference. He did
  not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian about alternatives to
  net zero, but said in an email to supporters his opposition “reflects a
  growing concern from mainstream Australians about our expensive energy bills,
  unreliable supply, and the erosion of our national sovereignty”. The former
  prime minister Tony Abbott is cheering on anti-net zero moves from outside
  parliament, including in an Institute of Public Affairs podcast this week. “If
  we are in favour of net zero, all of these economy-damaging measures are
  justified. If we want to avoid the economy-damaging measures, perhaps we do
  need to make that very symbolic act of saying, ‘well, actually, we’re not
  committed to net zero,’” he said. In an interview with former Canadian
  conservative politician Derek Fildebrandt in June, Abbott said Australia
  should continue to rely on fossil fuels. He said cutting emissions would cause
  “us to live like the Amish, or worse”. “If climate change is approached as a
  moral issue, the left wins. If climate change is approached as an economic
  issue, the right wins,” he said. “Yes, I accept that climate does change, that
  mankind does make a difference, and that we should do what we can to reduce
  emissions, but I would always add this critical rider – but not if it costs
  you your job, costs us our industries, and puts up your cost of living.”
