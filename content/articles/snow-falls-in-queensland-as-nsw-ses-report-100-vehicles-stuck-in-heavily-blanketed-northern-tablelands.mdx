  Snow has fallen in southern Queensland and the New South Wales State Emergency
  Service (SES) has responded to reports of up to 100 vehicles stuck in heavy
  snow blanketing the northern tablelands. Footage sent to Guardian Australia
  showed snow tumbling down at Dalveen, between Stanthorpe and Warwick in
  south-east Queensland, about 4pm on Saturday. Videos posted on social media
  page Higgins Storm Chasing showed snow falling on the town at the same time.
  Also at 4pm on Saturday, the SES reported up to 100 vehicles were stuck in
  snow on New England Highway, Waterfall Way, Norris Drive and Grafton Road in
  the northern tablelands. It said snow in the area was “at depths never seen
  before”. Rain was battering other parts of NSW on Saturday, and the SES had
  issued 28 warnings for residents across the Coffs Coast, Mid North Coast,
  Upper Hunter and New England regions. The SES warned 24-hour rainfall totals
  between 65mm and 100mm were likely, with isolated falls exceeding 130mm
  possible. The service’s assistant commissioner, Nicole Hogan, said heavy and
  persistent rain could result in some roads being flooded and becoming
  impassable. “We’ve had crews in Tamworth doorknocking low-lying areas to alert
  locals of potential localised flash flooding and road closures overnight
  tonight,” Hogan said. “We implore the community to never drive, walk or play
  in floodwater – if you come across a flooded road, turn around and find an
  alternative route.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email The heavy rainfall has
  caused rivers to rise, with moderate flooding along the Peel river at Tamworth
  and Namoi river at Gunnedah. In Queensland, a major cold front has swept the
  state, with snow falling in the south-east around Stanthorpe, Warwick and
  Dalveen. Videos posted on social media by Higgins Storm Chasing showed snow
  falling at Dalveen about 4pm on Saturday. In NSW, unusual snow levels had been
  reported at Armidale and Guyra, and falls of up to 50cm are possible
  throughout Saturday. Hogan said black ice was a significant risk and was
  causing dangerous road conditions throughout the northern tablelands. “We have
  road crash crews prepositioned and ready to respond to any rescues, but we ask
  the community to please avoid unnecessary travel,” she said. “If you do need
  to be on the roads in areas with snow, drive with caution, always use your
  brakes gently and drive slowly.” Damaging wind gusts exceeding 90km/h and
  large and powerful surf are also forecast. More than 1,000 NSW SES volunteers
  have been deployed across the state. The SES has responded to 750 calls since
  the onset of the bad weather.
