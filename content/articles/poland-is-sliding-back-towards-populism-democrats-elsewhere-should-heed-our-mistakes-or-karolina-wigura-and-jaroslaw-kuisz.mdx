  We were travelling across Poland by train the day after the country’s
  sensational parliamentary elections in autumn 2023. When news of the results
  came through, passengers in our compartment fell into each other’s arms,
  rejoicing as though a great weight had been lifted from their shoulders. Hard
  as it was to believe after eight years, the national populists of the Law and
  Justice party had been ousted from power on a record turnout of 75% of voters.
  We felt the potential of democracy to change things for the better as a
  physical sensation. Less than two years have passed but this enthusiasm has
  disappeared without trace. The Law and Justice-backed candidate Karol Nawrocki
  won the presidential election run off in June with 50.89% of the vote,
  securing the admiration of Donald Trump in the process. Days before Nawrocki’s
  swearing in on Wednesday [6 August] a new poll suggested that almost half of
  voters would like the prime minister, Donald Tusk out. The ruling coalition is
  wobbling. Tusk’s liberal democratic government may turn out to be nothing more
  than an intermezzo, a pause between rightwing populist governments. After more
  than a decade of living, in a global sense, with the new wave of populism, we
  can see a pattern of missed opportunities of which Poland is just one example.
  In countries ruled by new populists, voters often come to feel disappointment
  and anger. In recent years, liberal candidates, carried by a tide of
  opposition, have ousted the populists: before Tusk managed it in Poland there
  was Joe Biden in the US, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Zuzana
  Čaputová in Slovakia. The victories of these politicians seemed briefly like
  beacons of hope for the post-cold war liberal democratic consensus. But
  rebuilding after populists vacate office can resemble a daily struggle in the
  political mud. A victorious election campaign is not the same as a definitive
  victory. The war against populists is a permanent one, and a global one,
  amplified by digital media. Post-populist rule is all the more difficult
  because populist governments leave behind a legal minefield. In Poland,
  countless legal decisions and acts in force were intended to undermine liberal
  democratic institutions. Dismantling them constitutionally and restoring the
  rule of law takes time and energy. It also requires looking back to the past
  rather than focusing on the future as the new government addresses its
  predecessors’ mistakes. In Poland and Brazil, this has stifled any ambitions
  to offer an exciting roadmap for the years ahead. Inevitably, any initial
  euphoria is quickly followed by public frustration and the rise of another
  challenge from the rightwing populists. Since the anti-communist Solidarity
  movement in the 1980s, Poland has been a crucial laboratory in the battle for
  democracy. After returning to power in 2023, Tusk faced a dilemma: should he
  completely distance himself from his predecessors’ agenda or flirt with their
  legacy? Tusk chose the second option. He maintained the populists’ programme
  of direct financial support for families with children. He continued with the
  construction of a mega transport hub, a flagship project for the previous
  government that he had previously attacked as wasteful. It is especially
  striking that he has failed to liberalise Poland’s abortion laws, which were
  tightened by the populists. Echoing the nationalists’ rhetoric about migration
  and defence of national borders has led to Poland reimposing checks at its
  borders with EU neighbours Germany and Lithuania, despite all three countries
  being in the Schengen area. Letting the national populists set the political
  tone for him is driving Tusk’s failure. The defeat of his presidential
  candidate, Rafał Trzaskowski was followed by a collapse of support in the
  polls. The absence of an inspiring vision, or even a sense of what Tusk stands
  for, is painful to witness. If parliamentary elections were held today,
  Poland’s rightwing populists would be emphatically returned to power, probably
  with an even more radical nationalist programme. Abroad, Tusk may be admired
  as a staunch defender of democracy. At home, he has become one of the most
  unpopular politicians in the country. Call it the Gorbachev syndrome: beloved
  internationally, but reviled domestically. Tusk’s ratings slump can be blamed
  on a whole set of unfulfilled promises, poor messaging and a poor presidential
  campaign. He is also affected by the global tendency to reject establishment
  politicians. To many Polish voters, especially younger ones, Tusk, who has
  been active in Polish politics for more than 25 years and was prime minister
  from 2007 to 2014, seems like part of a tired old elite whose time has come to
  step aside. Safeguarding democracy requires something liberal democrats have
  so far lacked: an imaginative conception of what the future should look like.
  Here, Tusk and Lula disappoint, just as Čaputová and Biden did before them.
  The message is lacking, but the medium is challenging too. So far, rightwing
  populists are winning on the battleground of new and social media. It is not
  the only example, but the Polish case clearly demonstrates the folly of
  fighting elections purely on the defensive. It is too little and too narrow.
  Liberal ambitions must extend further than preventing populists from coming to
  power or removing them from it. Elections have to be understood as a chance to
  rebuild democracy, and to do so in tune with the new media environment.
  Without a forward-thinking approach, the liberal intermezzo will remain just
  that: a brief interval between acts in a longer populist play. Democrats must
  learn this lesson – contending with populism means not only confronting the
  past, but also offering a compelling vision for the future. Karolina Wigura is
  a Polish historian and co-author of Post-Traumatic Sovereignty: An Essay (Why
  the Eastern European Mentality is Different). Jarosław Kuisz is
  editor-in-chief of the Polish weekly Kultura Liberalna and the author of The
  New Politics of Poland: A Case of Post-Traumatic Sovereignty
