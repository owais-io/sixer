  The life and career of Sir Bill O’Brien, the former Labour MP, who has died
  aged 96, could easily have been adapted by any self-respecting novelist to
  provide a snapshot of the characteristic 20th-century working man (and they
  were always men) who becomes an admired and respected solid citizen, having
  successfully harnessed decades of gritty industrial experience to elected
  public office, first in the town hall and then at Westminster. The archetype
  was further richly fulfilled in O’Brien’s case as he was a Yorkshire miner,
  born into poverty, who learned to have the courage to speak truth to power
  within his own dying industry – which meant standing up to Arthur Scargill as
  leader of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) – and always to defend what
  he believed to be the right course of action, irrespective of political
  fashion. He was categorised as a moderate, but in reality he was an
  unapologetic pragmatist. “I’m not extreme in any way,” he once said. He would
  also cheerfully acknowledge that sometimes he agreed with the views of Tony
  Benn – regarded at the time as the arbiter of Labour’s left – and sometimes he
  did not. He first went to work at the coalface of Glasshoughton colliery, near
  Castleford, West Yorkshire, as a teenager at the end of the second world war
  and, after 38 years in the industry, was elected to the House of Commons as
  the MP for Normanton, south-east of Leeds, in 1983. He had already spent 30
  years as a councillor, from 1951 as a member of Knottingley urban district
  council and subsequently, from 1973, on Wakefield metropolitan district
  council, where he chaired the finance committee and was deputy leader for a
  decade. His local government experience gave him an authority and an
  understanding of transport, housing and environmental issues, as well as the
  economic implications of public spending in those areas. His years down the
  pit made his voice one that deservedly won an audience during his 22 years in
  the Commons, a period that coincided with the decades that saw the effective
  closure of the British coal industry. Throughout his career, he argued for a
  massive redistribution of funding to Yorkshire and the north of England,
  asserting that the responsibilities of devolved political power mattered far
  less than the availability of greater resources, while he also sought
  investment in “clean” coal technology. In 2003 he warned the prime minister,
  Tony Blair, about the findings of a report by the Institution of Civil
  Engineers predicting that future gas supplies piped to the UK could be sourced
  from politically unstable countries and thus vulnerable to supply failures,
  sabotage and terrorism. In O’Brien’s maiden speech in July 1983, on the then
  controversial Thatcher government policy of council house sales, he typically
  reasoned that some sales of municipal housing were popular, but insisted that
  sales should only be allowed to go ahead on a voluntary basis. He was
  appointed to the public accounts committee shortly thereafter and was a
  diligent member until 1988, also serving on the energy select committee from
  1986 until 1988. He was appointed by Neil Kinnock to the opposition frontbench
  as a member of the environment team in the wake of the 1987 general election,
  having nearly doubled his majority in what had been a redrawn seat when he won
  it at the low point in his party’s electoral fortunes four years earlier. In
  1992, John Smith switched him to the Northern Ireland brief, where his status
  as a Roman Catholic had resonance. He returned to the backbenches when Blair
  became leader and, for the remainder of his tenure as an MP, served as a
  member of the select committee dealing with the environment, transport and
  local government. After standing down as an MP in 2005 he remained active in
  local affairs. A magistrate and a school governor, he continued to campaign on
  political issues in Pontefract, where he lived. He was knighted in the Labour
  government’s retirement honours list in 2010. O’Brien was born into a mining
  family in the Glasshoughton neighbourhood of Castleford and, after attending
  St Joseph’s Roman Catholic school in the town, joined the workforce at the
  local colliery along with three of his four brothers. He signed up with the
  Labour party and the NUM aged 16, and early on discovered an aptitude for
  organising, which led him into trade union activism, becoming branch secretary
  at Glasshoughton. He also studied for an extramural degree at Leeds University
  and was awarded a BEd degree in 1978. His political stance brought him into
  recurring conflict with Scargill, notably in 1976 when O’Brien supported the
  Sheffield Star in a court case brought against the newspaper by Scargill.
  Having nevertheless won his legal case, Scargill subsequently attempted to
  suspend O’Brien from holding union office. This resulted in further legal
  action, this time won by O’Brien. During the selection procedure for the
  Labour candidate for Normanton – after the announced retirement of the sitting
  MP – O’Brien then successfully defeated the candidate proposed by Scargill.
  The two also clashed during the subsequent year-long miners’ strike of
  1984-85, which O’Brien wholeheartedly supported, while rejecting the tactics
  of the union leadership. In retirement O’Brien researched and published a book
  on the history of the Prince of Wales colliery in Pontefract, which had once
  served as the town’s largest employer – with 2,200 on the payroll in 1958 – in
  its 133 years of operation until closure in 2002. In 1978 he married Jean
  Scofield, who survives him, as does his daughter, Darrel, from an earlier
  marriage, and her two daughters, Kaye and Diane. • Bill (William) O’Brien,
  miner and politician, born 25 January 1929; died 16 May 2025 • This article
  was amended on 25 August 2025 to correct Bill O’Brien’s date of death as 16
  May 2025, rather than 18 May as an earlier version said.
