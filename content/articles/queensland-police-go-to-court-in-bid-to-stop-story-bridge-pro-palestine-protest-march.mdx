  The Queensland police service will take protest organisers to court in an
  effort to halt a planned pro-Palestine march over Brisbane’s Story Bridge this
  weekend. Justice for Palestine Magan-djin (Brisbane) have advertised plans to
  march over the bridge at 1pm on Sunday – replicating similar protests that
  occurred earlier this month in Sydney and Melbourne. Spokesperson for Justice
  for Palestine Magan-djin Remah Naji said the group is expecting at least 7,000
  people to attend the rally. The Queensland police oppose the march on public
  safety grounds. “Under provisions of the peaceful assembly act, police will
  lodge documentation with Brisbane magistrates court for a decision to be made
  with respect to the notice of intention to hold a public assembly,” a
  spokesperson for the Queensland police service said. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email The matter is yet to be given a date of listing. A cycling group was
  denied the right to march or ride over the bridge earlier this year at a
  hearing at the magistrates court on public safety grounds. Naji said the march
  organisers had already briefed lawyers and were ready for a legal fight.
  “We’re very much willing to defend our fundamental right to peaceful assembly.
  If they want to go down this path, we’re ready,” she said. Police in New South
  Wales sought to deny legal protection to a planned protest over the Sydney
  Harbour Bridge earlier this month – but that bid was overturned by the NSW
  supreme court at the 11th hour. Police say 90,000 people marched across that
  iconic structure, organisers put the figure at closer to 300,000 – regardless,
  the scale of the turnout ranks the protest as historic and the day went ahead
  without major incidents. In Melbourne on the same day, in contrast,
  pro-Palestine protesters were met by a wall of police in riot gear behind
  barricades and backed by a row of mounted officers and riot squad vans when
  they sought to cross the King Street Bridge. Justice for Palestine Magan-djin
  conducted mediation with Queensland police on Monday morning. QPS presented
  two options to the protest group for locations other than the bridge. A
  spokesperson for the QPS confirmed that mediation had taken place on Monday
  morning “however an agreement could not be met”. Naji didn’t rule out
  violating a court injunction if the magistrates court ruled against them,
  saying it would be a decision for the group collectively. She said the bridge
  was a central part of the protest because the urgency of the situation in
  Gaza. “This ongoing livestreamed genocide demands visibility. It is not enough
  for us to do the usual routes,” Naji said. She said the aim of the march was
  “to apply the maximum pressure on our government”. Justice for Palestine
  Magan-djin has been holding regular protests in Brisbane for the last 22
  months since the escalation of the conflict in Gaza after Israel responded to
  Hamas’ attack on 7 October 2023 with a full-scale invasion, bombardment and
  blockade of aid in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 people have been killed in
  Gaza – mostly women, children and elderly people – since the war began,
  according to Palestinian health officials. – With additional reporting by Joe
