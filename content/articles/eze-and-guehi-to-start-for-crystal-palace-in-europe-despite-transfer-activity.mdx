  Oliver Glasner has confirmed that Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi will both start
  in the first leg of Crystal Palace’s Conference League playoff on Thursday and
  insisted that the England pair remain committed to the club despite continuing
  doubts about their futures. Arsenal on Wednesday night agreed a £68m deal for
  Eze, after it looked as though the 27-year-old was heading for Spurs.
  Liverpool, meanwhile, are leading the race to sign Guéhi but have yet to meet
  Palace’s valuation of £40m for their captain, whose contract at Selhurst Park
  expires next year. Both players started the goalless draw at Chelsea on Sunday
  despite speculation that Eze could be absent as negotiations with Spurs
  continued and they would be eligible to play in the Champions League even if
  selected to face Norway’s cup winners Fredrikstad on Thursday. Glasner was
  adamant that the pair will feature and he praised Eze and Guéhi for the way
  they have conducted themselves this week. “I think it’s also the right of a
  club and the duty of a player to give 100% as long as he’s under contract,”
  the Palace manager said. “On the other side, I know this is the theory. I
  think many of you were surprised that Marc and Ebs started and played almost
  the whole game [against Chelsea]. Most of you will be surprised that they will
  start again tomorrow because of all the rumours, but again they are committed
  to the team. “They have a contract here. They played a crucial part that we
  could be so successful and they will play a crucial part as long as they are
  here. When one of the players will leave, which I don’t know at the moment,
  they want to leave as the players who always give 100% for Crystal Palace.”
  Asked whether he was surprised by how Eze and Guéhi have handled the
  speculation surrounding them, the Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson said: “No,
  I think the pair of them are great lads and they’re so committed and so
  professional. I’m sure they’ll keep staying committed throughout and they’re
  always here to help the team and they’re part of us at the minute, so we’ll
  keep enjoying it.” In the first taste of a major European competition in their
  history, Palace will face Fredrikstad for a place in the Conference League
  after being demoted from the Europa League by Uefa for contravening its rules
  on multiclub ownership. Glasner was keen not to underestimate Palace’s
  opponents but believes his FA Cup‑winning side can use the disappointment of
  missing out on the more prestigious competition as motivation for more
  success. “I think if you win the FA Cup, you should be in the Europa League,
  but the reality is we’re excited for the journey we’re going to go on this
  season,” he said. “It’s the reward for the club to take part in the European
  competition for all their effort last season.” Meanwhile, Palace are
  understood to be close to agreeing a deal with Leicester to sign Bilal El
  Khannouss as a potential replacement for Eze. They have also shown interest in
  Christos Tzolis but Club Brugge are reluctant to sell the Greek forward this
  summer. The former Bournemouth and Newcastle defender Lloyd Kelly – now at
  Juventus – is an option to replace Guéhi should he depart, and Glasner is keen
  to add Hwang Hee-chan on loan but must wait until Wolves can secure a
  replacement for the South Korean forward.
