  Detectives have launched a murder investigation after a teenager died in
  Greater Manchester in a “targeted attack”, police have said. The 19-year-old
  sustained several stab wounds and died later from his injuries. The victim was
  attacked just before 9pm on Friday in a car park on Market Street in Bury. No
  arrests have been made, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. The incident is
  believed to have taken place at a small-sided football complex. DCI John
  Charlton, from GMP’s major incident team, said: “Firstly, our thoughts are
  with the victim’s family and friends after this tragic and upsetting incident
  – our specially trained officers are supporting them at this difficult time.
  “This incident will have shocked the community and distressed anyone who
  witnessed it, but we believe this was a targeted attack with no wider threat.
  “We have several scenes in place with the investigation ongoing in order to
  identify and apprehend the offenders responsible. There will be officers in
  the area today and in the coming days as we are determined to bring the family
  the answers they deserve. “If anyone has any information or was in the area at
  the time, they should contact us quoting log 3354-01/08/25.”
