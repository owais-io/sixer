  A possible class-action lawsuit against Amazon Prime, one of the world’s
  biggest platforms for streaming film and television, has raised an odd
  question: what does it mean to buy something? The proposed lawsuit, which was
  filed last week in federal court and first reported by the Hollywood Reporter,
  alleges that Prime’s practice of offering users the chance to “buy” (as
  opposed to “rent”) content is inherently deceptive. The suit argues that
  buying something implies perpetual possession – but that Amazon, like many
  other streaming services, is really just selling its customers viewing
  licenses that can be revoked at any time, in keeping with fine print that most
  customers do not read or understand. Regardless of whether the lawsuit is
  ultimately successful, it speaks to a real problem in an age when people
  access films, television series, music and video games through fickle online
  platforms: impermanence. The advent of streaming promised a world of digital
  riches in which we could access libraries of our favorite content whenever we
  wanted. It hasn’t exactly worked out that way. Many movie fans are already
  familiar with a certain scenario. Let’s say that you are seized, this Friday
  night, by an urge to rewatch one of your favorite films, Double Indemnity.
  (You are a popular and sociable person – charismatic, attractive, with many
  friends – but feel under the weather this weekend.) If you are especially
  prudent, you own the film on a physical format – such as a Criterion
  Collection Blu-ray – but if not, you just type watch double indemnity 1944
  into a search engine and see what comes up. Given that beloved older films and
  television shows are increasingly difficult to find on streaming platforms,
  you will be relieved to see the film listed on any of the services you
  subscribe to, such as Netflix, Hulu or HBO Max. When you click on the links,
  however, there is a high chance that one of those dreaded landing pages
  appears: “REMIND ME WHEN THIS IS AVAILABLE” or “THIS TITLE IS NOT CURRENTLY
  AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTRY.” There are ways to watch the film that don’t
  involve paying, but let’s say that you’re a scrupulously honest person.
  Fortunately, Amazon Prime has Double Indemnity available on demand: you can
  rent the movie, for 48 hours of playback, for $3.79 – or “buy” it for $14.99.
  The second option is more expensive, but if it is truly one of your favorite
  movies you may decide to buy it so you can watch it again whenever you want.
  And in just a couple of clicks – faster than Barbara Stanwyck can light a
  cigarette in the darkened living room of a California villa – the Paramount
  logo is blooming on your television screen. Not bad, right? The problem is
  that you aren’t downloading the movie, to own and watch forever; you’re just
  getting access to it on Amazon’s servers – a right that only lasts as long as
  Amazon also has access to the film, which depends on capricious licensing
  agreements that vary from title to title. A month or five years from now, that
  license may expire – and the movie will disappear from your Amazon library.
  Yet the $14.99 you paid does not reappear in your pocket. If you’re a film
  buff, like me, you may already have heard of things like this happening. In
  2018, users of iTunes who had purchased titles for their digital libraries
  were unhappy to learn that the company had deleted some of them without
  telling them. Last year, customers of Funimation, an anime streaming service
  that was acquired by another company, discovered that the titles they had
  purchased from Funimation would not be ported over to the new platform. Video
  game and music fans have reported similar frustrations. If online chatter is
  any indication, a class-action lawsuit against Prime would have some takers.
  Reacting to the news of the suit, someone on Reddit described buying the
  director’s cut of Aliens from Prime; after watching it for 10 years, “I went
  to my purchased movies in the Amazon app and it is now gone. No explanation
  and no recourse.” “Happened to me,” another person wrote. “Bought the original
  Battlestar Galactica series. Now it’s gone.” (Amazon did not respond to my
  request for comment at the time of publication.) Disappointment with
  streaming’s limitations are a major reason that many pop culture fans have, in
  recent years, returned to a format long thought dying: physical media. Like
  vinyl records, which have had an unexpected renaissance, film discs and other
  seemingly old-school technologies have been embraced in recent years by a
  small but passionate segment of film and TV buffs. Earlier this year, the
  first new physical video store in many years opened in New York. In
  particular, movie fans have rediscovered Blu-rays, which debuted in 2006 as a
  higher-definition successor to DVDs, as well as their new and even
  higher-definition sibling, the 4K UHD, which has become the gold-standard for
  “home cinema” enthusiasts. I’m one of those physical-media fans. I have about
  400 movies on disc, mostly Blu-rays, hidden in a cabinet beneath my TV. In the
  age of streaming, some of my friends think I’m deranged. But the films look
  great, don’t need the internet to watch and – most importantly – never
  disappear.
