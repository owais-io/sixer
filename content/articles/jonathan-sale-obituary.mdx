  My father, Jonathan Sale, who has died aged 81, spent his entire career as a
  journalist. He was known for covering quirky and retrospective topics and his
  writing reflected his personality: curious, kind, and humorous. He cut his
  teeth on Fleet Street in magazines, at Queen and later at Punch for many
  years, where he eventually became features editor and, for a time, the wine
  correspondent – a slightly odd fit, as he had been teetotal since leaving
  university. In 1986, after Punch was taken over, he was made redundant. His
  severance package included a new Apple Mac computer, which became his pride
  and joy as he set himself up as a freelance writer – a role he remained in for
  the rest of his life. Born and brought up in Cambridge, the son of Ellen (nee
  Webster) and Arthur Sale, an English don at Magdalene College, Jonathan went
  to the Leys school and studied English at Christ’s College, Cambridge, in the
  early 1960s. He was far more interested in working for Varsity, the university
  newspaper, than in his formal studies. Jonathan wrote for the Independent, the
  Times, the Guardian (where he wrote many obituaries), the New European and the
  Daily and Sunday Telegraph, among others. His work focused on unusual and
  nostalgic themes – musings on eccentric bicycles, his own impending baldness,
  the joys and sorrows of parenthood, and meeting Lonnie Donegan. Whatever the
  subject, his writing always struck a thoughtful balance between gentle humour
  and seriousness. My siblings and I had to be careful, because if you did
  anything out of the ordinary it was likely to be described later in a
  newspaper article in which you would be gently mocked. His regular column in
  the Independent, Passed/Failed, where he interviewed public figures about
  their schooldays, was published as a book in 2014: Telling Tales Out of
  School. He was a lifelong supporter of the Labour party, famously breaking his
  decades-long sobriety only once – to raise a glass when Labour won in 1997. He
  later became chair of the Peckham Rye ward. During the acrimonious post-Brexit
  years, he was praised for running meetings “like discussions around a
  campfire”, bringing out the best in people even when tensions ran high. He
  campaigned to save Honor Oak Park Rec, and served on the committee of the
  Friends of One Tree Hill, working to preserve and enhance this patch of wild
  south London woodland. Jonathan’s main mode of transport was always his bike –
  when deliveries were made from local shops, the name on the order was often
  simply “man on bike”. His other great love was music, especially jazz and
  blues. He was at his happiest in his study, with the Guardian open and Miles
  Davis or Muddy Waters playing in the background. He met my mother, Ruth
  Bateman, a civil servant, in 1968, and they married in 1970. Jonathan cared
  for her when she became ill in 1985 with what was later diagnosed as a
  slow-growing brain tumour. Ruth died from it in 2005. Jonathan simply couldn’t
  be engaged in a boring conversation – it wasn’t in his nature. He was known
  for his gentle humour, playfulness and love of a practical joke. He is
  survived by his partner Diana Aubrey, whom he met in 2007 and with whom he
  lived in North London in his final years, his children, Rebecca, Jessica and
  me, and his grandchildren, Jack, Heather, Solly and Reuben.
