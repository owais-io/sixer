  We write as former colleagues who worked together from the 1980s on
  identifying the cause of tinnitus. After the outburst of negativity about
  tinnitus distress on your letters page (10 August), we feel compelled to put
  more than an element of good news into the discussion. Being able to hear
  tinnitus at some time is almost universal. Persistent distressing tinnitus is
  due in large part to the meaning ascribed to it and the subsequent strong
  emotions evoked, which establish a conditioned response that does not
  habituate. Sounds that are threatening demand our constant attention. Tinnitus
  retraining therapy, which follows the science of the Jastreboff model and our
  research, has been very successful. While there is no quick fix, this is a
  slow fix that really works when patiently followed, and is used by
  audiologists around the world. Visit tinnitus.org and tinnitus-pjj.com to make
  up your own mind. You do not have to live with it. Jonathan Hazell Honorary
  consultant neuro-otologist, University College London (retired); former
  director, Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Centre, London Pawel Jastreboff Visiting
  professor, UCL; professor emeritus, department of otolaryngology, Emory
  University School of Medicine • My tinnitus started after the use of a plug-in
  mouse-repellant device that emits a high-pitch frequency and which,
  apparently, humans cannot hear. It continued mostly as a high-pitch constant
  noise just like the sound of the plug-in, but spiked once and sounded like a
  plane was about to crash into the room. When I can’t bear the high-pitched
  sound, I put in my NHS ear devices that give off a white noise “shuffling”
  sound, cancelling out the noise in my head. I have chosen to live with it
  rather than suffer anxiety and distress because of it, as I know it will never
  go away. Karen Royall Wigton, Cumbria • I am 73. I don’t know how long I have
  had tinnitus, but I certainly had it after a spell in a woodworking factory,
  unprotected, in 1970, and that’s 55 years and counting. Since then it has
  always been present, a continuous experience of multiple, swirling
  high-pitched whistles (like standing on the shore of an electronic ocean)
  accompanied by the tick-tick-tick of a pocket watch. It is at its worst when I
  am surrounded by silence, at night. But it has also conspired to make my
  presence in company more difficult, as my brain gets older and finds it more
  difficult to select the sounds it needs to focus on. I no longer go to parties
  and cannot hear in loud pubs or restaurants. It masks dialogue when I watch TV
  or films. I have given up expecting a cure. I don’t even expect my GP to care
  about it. Their indifference, derived, I think, from their impotence in the
  face of it, makes it embarrassing to refer to it. But its impact on my life,
  both working and social, has been huge and entirely negative. My sympathy goes
  out to the many fellow sufferers. Christopher House Hertford • Have an opinion
