  That’s where we’ll wrap the blog up for today, but first: a quick recap of the
  big events: The University of Technology Sydney has announced a plan to
  “temporarily suspend” 140 courses across six faculties. The Business Council
  of Australia has proposed a plan to cut $110bn red tape. Mike Huckabee said he
  was ‘disgusted’ by Australia’s recognition of a Palestinian state. Israel’s
  deputy foreign affairs minister said the people who marched across the Sydney
  Harbour Bridge in support of ending the Israel-Gaza war were “naive” and
  “useful idiots”. Investment in new wind and solar has fallen well short of the
  pace required to hit Australia’s 2030 renewable energy target. Katy Gallagher
  identified a ‘worrying trend’ of young men believing there’s ‘too much focus
  on women’. The attorney general, Michelle Rowland, announced the states have
  agreed to toughen the Working With Children Checks. Anthony Albanese has
  declared receiving a gift of a terracotta plaque from Pope Leo and a white
  felt hat from the Canadian prime minister in his latest update to the
  parliamentary register of interests. An NT man has died during a police search
  of his home. About 30 writers and authors have withdrawn from Bendigo writers
  festival over a code of conduct that requires ‘self-censorship’ over Israel
  and Gaza. Take care and enjoy your weekend. Greens push for Senate inquiry
  into early childcare safety The Greens have announced they want a Senate
  Inquiry into the quality and safety of early childhood education and care as
  soon as Parliament resumes. Senator Steph Hodgins-May, the Greens spokesperson
  for early childhood education and care, said in a statement: A national
  Working With Children Check is long overdue. Whilst its reassuring to know
  that this will be in place by the end of the year, frankly, this is a decade
  after it was recommended by the royal commission. Real action means more than
  introducing a check a decade after it was recommended. It means tackling
  for-profit cowboys sidelining quality and care in favour of profit, and a
  workforce in crisis. The Greens are today announcing our intention to
  establish a Senate inquiry into the quality and safety of early childhood
  education and care as soon as parliament resumes. We recognise that we cannot
  keep waiting for these horrific headlines of abuse to take meaningful action.
  The government must do more than Band-aids. It must sit down with everyone in
  the parliament willing to prioritise the safety and care of our children and
  enact meaningful reform to keep our kids safe. A man who died during a police
  search of his home in the Northern Territory is being investigated as a death
  in custody. The police officers executing the search warrant in the suburb of
  Rosebery south-east of Darwin were part of the joint anti-child exploitation
  team. A 62-year-old man and his wife were at the residence when the search
  began at 7am, police said in a statement: At approximately 8am, the man
  obtained a knife from within the residence and stabbed himself multiple times
  in the chest. Police deployed a taser in an attempt to prevent the man from
  further harming himself. An officer also received a laceration to his hand
  while trying to disarm him. Officers provided immediate first aid to the
  62-year-old. St John Ambulance also arrived at the scene soon after but the
  man succumbed to his injuries and was declared deceased at the scene. … Major
  Crime Investigators remain on scene and the incident is being treated as a
  death in custody. Lesser welcomes childcare working check reforms and says
  opposition will hold government to their timetable The shadow attorney
  general, Julian Leeser, also appeared on Afternoon Briefing. He welcomed
  Rowland’s change in the timeline, giving assurance it would be in place before
  the end of the year: This morning the federal attorney general gave an
  interview on radio national, where she said this would take a year. We put out
  a release because we just felt that that was much too long and so, I was very
  pleased to see the attorneys general across the country saying that they would
  get this done by the end of the year. …we’ve chosen not to play politics with
  this and the reason is because I think people are sick of the finger-pointing
  exercise in relation to these sorts of issues. We have given the government
  support to do this. We just want to see it get done and we will hold the
  government to the timetable there. Commissioner says working with children
  checks need to be stronger Hollonds was asked if she was confident there will
  be reforms of who can get a Working with Children Check: I think the
  announcement today does not make this particular screening tool any stronger.
  It does need to be stronger. It is very basic still. It is mostly about police
  convictions in the past. And I think the name itself, Working with Children
  Check kind of gives the impression that it is assessing your suitability to
  care for children, which it is clearly not. It is just checking whether you
  have police convictions, in most cases. So you know we really need to do a lot
  more to be able to assess the suitability of people who want to care for
  children and so that employers can have the confidence that they are employing
  the right people and so, the national register of educators that is being
  proposed is also really, really important. We need to be doing proper referee
  checks, we need mandatory child safety training on top of their basic early
  childhood educator training. All of these things will help to strengthen the
  safeguarding scaffolding that we need, not just in the early childhood sector
  but beyond. Children’s commissioner welcomes agreement to working with
  children reforms The national children’s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, says she
  is “hugely relieved” the national Working With Children Check reforms have
  been committed to by states and territories. Appearing on ABC’s Afternoon
  Briefing, Hollonds was asked if the plan that they have come up will make
  children safer. I am hugely relieved at this announcement today and I’m really
  grateful to the attorney general for her decisive action and her commitment to
  get this job done and, yes, if this happens, it will absolutely make a
  difference to the safety of children. Remembering that this is just the first
  step of a whole range of actions that need to be taken, but it is a very
  important first step. Around 30 authors and academics have now withdrawn from
  this weekend’s Bendigo writer’s festival over a speaker code that one says
  requires “complete self-censorship” over Israel’s war in Gaza. The festival’s
  code, viewed by Guardian Australia, says speakers should uphold respectful
  engagements which involves avoiding language or topics that “could be
  considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful”. A source told Guardian
  Australia Bendigo writers’ festival (BWF) sent some speakers the code of
  conduct on Wednesday – two days before the opening day. The code says that for
  “La Trobe Presents” panels, speakers must comply with the principles espoused
  in La Trobe University’s anti-racism plan, including the plan’s definitions of
  antisemitism and Islamophobia. Academic and author Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah,
  First Nations poet Dr Evelyn Araluen and Wiradjuri writer and poet Jeanine
  Leane were among the first to have withdrawn from the festival over the code.
  An updated list of withdrawals, updated by the group Readers and Writers
  against Genocide, now includes 30 names including Thomas Mayo, Jock Serong,
  Jess Hill, and Kirstin Ferguson. In a social media post, Ferguson said her
  decision to withdraw was based on freedom of expression: My decision is not
  about my personal position on any specific political or social issue, which I
  have never shared publicly. However, I do hold firm views about the importance
  of protecting any person’s right to speak on topics important to them - even
  those topics that may be considered inflammatory, divisive or even
  disrespectful by some. A spokesperson for the Bendigo writers’ festival said
  it was “committed to holding an event that engages in respectful debate, open
  minded discussion, and explores topical and complex issues.” “The festival and
  presenting partner La Trobe University felt it was necessary to emphasise the
  importance of safety and wellbeing for all participants by introducing a code
  of conduct,” the spokesperson said. Academic welcomes ‘powerful statement’
  from attorneys general on working with children check Prof Daryl Higgins, the
  director of Australian Catholic University’s Institute of Child Protection
  Studies who has long advocated for a national Working With Children Check
  system, says today’s announcement is a “powerful statement from our attorneys
  general” but adds that it is a shame it took such “horrific incidents” for the
  action to be taken. It’s been a long time coming, but it’s pleasing to see the
  national approach to the Working With Children Check system announced today.
  The banned in one jurisdiction, banned in all commitment is a powerful
  statement from our attorneys general that all Australian children deserve the
  same level of safeguarding. I welcome the commitment to greater information
  sharing between jurisdictions, but caution that this needs to be carefully
  implemented to ensure important intelligence does not fall through the cracks.
  It’s a shame it took such horrific incidents against our most vulnerable
  members of society, our children, for this action to be taken. We can’t become
  complacent. We need all governments to continue to work in a bipartisan way to
  further strengthen systems and hold those who would do our children harm to
  account. We also need to refocus our attention on primary prevention through
  better systems of design and improved professional development for childcare
  educators to empower them to call out anything untoward and to confidently
  make safeguarding their number one priority. Thanks Daisy for taking us
  through another big day of news. I’ll be with you for the rest of the
  afternoon! That’s all from Ima Caldwell and me today – thanks for joining us.
  I’ll leave you in the hands of the lovely Natasha May for the rest of the
  day’s breaking news. Wet season forecast shows earlier onset in the east,
  later in the west The Bureau of Meteorology has released its forecast for
  Northern Australia’s 2025-26 wet season, starting 1 September. In Queensland
  rainfall onset is likely to be earlier than normal for most of the state, with
  an even higher chance in parts of the central interior. The wet season is also
  forecast to arrive earlier than usual in the Northern Territory, except for
  parts of its western interior. In Western Australia the rainy season will
  arrive later than normal for much of the north and west of the state. There is
  a roughly equal chance of an earlier, later or near-normal onset for areas
  along the Western Australia–Northern Territory border. Melbourne cinema to pay
  tribute to ‘one of a kind’ David Stratton Cinema Nova in Melbourne will pay
  tribute to the late film critic David Stratton, with two free screenings of
  1952 classic, Singin’ In The Rain. A statement from David’s family suggested
  his devotees “celebrate David’s remarkable life and legacy by watching his
  favourite movie — Singin’ In the Rain.” Speaking about this weekend’s
  screenings in Stratton’s memory, Cinema Nova co-director, Natalie Miller said
  in a statement: David was one of a kind. His incredible knowledge of films
  leaves me in awe. His support of the Australian film industry was amazing, and
  I am thankful that I knew him professionally and as a friend. And, Australia’s
  most underrated native animal is … The rakali, or native water rat, has been
  voted Australia’s most underrated native animal in a poll by ABC Radio
  National, as part of Science Week 2025. Gathering more than 20% of the 65,000
  votes cast, the rakali beat nine other finalists, including the giant
  cuttlefish, dugong, turtle frog and palm cockatoo. Dr Ann Jones, host of Radio
  National’s What the Duck?!, said in a statement: The rakali is the
  quintessential underrated Australian animal – it’s widespread but secretive,
  it’s fluffy but a kick-arse fighter, it surprises and delights observers and
  its very presence repels introduced black rats out of its territory. It can
  travel great distances over land, but swims better than Kieren Perkins (sorry
  Kieren). The rakali is worthy of this crown. It is more than a rat – it is the
  Ruler of ALL the Rats. Football fans to set alarms for return of Premier
  League It’s that time of the year again when diehard football fans prepare for
  late nights or set their alarm clocks to go off at ungodly hours: the Premier
  League is back, full of thrills but facing a threat to its superpower, as
  Barney Ronay writes. The new season kicks off this weekend, with champions
  Liverpool beginning the defence of their title against Bournemouth in the
  curtain raiser at 5am AEST on Saturday morning. For the first time, the
  most-watched league in the world will be broadcast by Nine Entertainment-owned
  Stan Sports, after Optus Sport transferred its sports streaming rights for a
  sum of about $300m. Even without Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham
  despite the Australian coach’s success in the Europa League final, Nine has
  recognised the broader appeal of the Premier League and will show one game
  from each of the first three rounds this season on its main free-to-air
  station Channel Nine. Read more here: Anthony Albanese has declared receiving
  a gift of a terracotta plaque from Pope Leo and a white felt hat from the
  Canadian prime minister in his latest update to the parliamentary register of
  interests. The start of the new parliamentary term, after the election, means
  all MPs and senators are nearing the deadline to lodge their register of
  interests, which includes properties, bank accounts, stock holdings and gifts
  they’ve received. Many have already done so ahead of the deadline, but a
  number still have their list outstanding. We’ll be bringing you more reporting
  on those declarations soon. Albanese’s register, published online this week,
  notes two investment properties - his former home in Marrickville and the
  Central Coast beach house he purchased with his fiancé, Jodie Haydon, last
  year, as well as the rental income from both. The prime minister declared he
  had received gifts including a wooden carving of the famous Indonesian Garuda
  statue from President Prabowo Subianto, which is displayed in Australia’s
  embassy in Jakarta. Albanese, who visited Rome for the Pope’s inauguration and
  met the new pontiff, also received: a carved terracotta plaque; a white felt
  stetson hat from Mark Carney, Canada’s leader; and a vase and bowl from “Sky
  News / The Australian”. The PM also noted he’d received tickets to the first
  and third game of the State of Origin rugby league series from the NRL in May
  and July. Attorney general promises no standards in child protection scheme
  will drop as a result of harmonisation Rowland also said the scheme won’t be
  exactly the same in all states and territories but the government will be
  aiming to achieve a consistency in standards: When we talk about
  harmonisation, we are not looking at a scheme to make every single state
  exactly the same. We are not looking to redo individual state systems. We are
  looking for consistency. And one of the key points that came about from
  today’s agreement in SCAG is that no state and territory would be required to
  lower the ... standards that they have. Now, they are different in between
  each state and territory and I’m happy for my colleagues, individually, to
  speak towards that. But the key issue here is that we have agreed that no
  jurisdiction will be required to lower their standards. To the contrary – we
  want all standards to lift – to lift across the commonwealth so that we have
  the most robust scheme. Rowland says working with children reforms have been
  accelerated Rowland said all states and territories have agreed to “pull out
  all stops” to ensure the reforms are implemented as soon as possible, bringing
  forward the the timeline: We took this urgent reform to SCAG [the Standing
  Council of Attorneys General] as a priority, initially expecting that this
  could take up to 12 months as a feasible time frame that the commonwealth,
  states and territories could agree to for implementation. So I’m extremely
  pleased to accelerate delivery of the reform with states and territories
  agreeing to working towards implementation by the end of this year. There is a
  firm commitment from all states and territories to pull out all stops, and we
  are working together as a team. … This is not a set and forget exercise. We
  will continue to work together, including in future meet[ings] of SCAG to help
  keep our young people safe. The attorney general Michelle Rowland is
  addressing the media after discussing national reforms to Working With
  Children Checks with state attorney generals: The foremost priority of any
  government is to keep Australians safe and that particularly extends to the
  most vulnerable in our community - our young people. And that’s why today, all
  jurisdictions have agreed to deliver ambitious reforms to address systemic
  gaps in the Working With Children Checks regime to improve the safety of
  children across Australia. Attorney generals-today agreed to toughening the
  system, by ensuring that if you’re banned from holding a working with children
  check in one jurisdiction, you’re banned in all of them. Banned in one -
  banned in all. Aussie shares make history with record-breaking streak
  Australia’s key benchmark index has spiked above 8,900 points for the first
  time, making five record resets in five sessions for the local bourse, AAP
  reports. The S&amp;P/ASX200 spiked to a fresh high of 9,177.3, before easing
  to 8,882.6 points by midday, up 8.8 points, or 0.12%, as the broader All
  Ordinaries gained 11.9 points, or 0.13%, to 9161. Tony Sycamore, an analyst
  for IG Markets, said it was a feat “unprecedented over the past decade”. This
  week’s gains have followed a rally on Wall Street, the Reserve Bank’s recent
  25-basis-point rate cut to 3.6% and July’s in-line labour force report,
  reinforcing the RBA’s cautious 2025 rate cut strategy and teasing further cuts
  ahead, most likely in November and February. Friday’s relatively steady start
  came after a flat US session overnight, after producer price growth in the
  world’s largest economy weighed on expectations of the timing and magnitude of
  future interest rate cuts. The minister for women, Katy Gallagher, said it is
  a “worrying trend” that some young men believe women are receiving all the
  opportunities in a way that is impacting male rights, AAP reports. Gallagher
  told the Women in Media national conference today: In Australia, our ethos of
  everyone having a fair go and treating people equally is really strong -
  certainly across business, community and government. …There is a worrying
  trend emerging ... particularly with young men thinking that women are getting
  too much and that their rights are going backwards, and there’s too much focus
  on women. Sydney Ukrainian community plans to rally ahead of US-Russia meeting
  Members of Ukraine’s diaspora community are rallying outside the US Consulate
  in North Sydney Friday afternoon, concerned at the US president’s meeting with
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin, without the Ukrainian president present.
  Organiser Anton Bogdanovych told the Guardian the message of the rally is
  “appeasement doesn’t bring peace”. “Ukrainians and supporters are deeply
  concerned with the upcoming meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin
  that is about to happen in Alaska today. The fact that Volodymyr Zelensky, the
  president of Ukraine, is not invited to this meeting is very disturbing, as it
  violates the principle: ‘nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine’. “The meeting
  in Alaska reminds us of the meeting in Munich between the British Prime
  Minister Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler that took place in September
  1938. The Munich meeting determined the fate of Czechoslovakia - without the
  leaders of this country being invited - which resulted in the agreement that
  ceded the Sudetenland to Germany. “We all remember that soon after the Munich
  agreement Germany, emboldened by it, started World War II.” Ukrainians in
  Sydney are rallying outside the US Consulate in Miller Street, North Sydney
  from 4:30pm, Bogdanovych said, “to warn US officials and the world about the
  dangers of repeating the mistakes of the past”. Can Labor jumpstart the
  economy? Next week the Albanese government will bring together business
  leaders, unions and interest groups at an economic roundtable to discuss how
  to best jumpstart the economy. Big ideas such as a four-day work week and
  limiting negative gearing have been put forward, but the prime minister has
  been quick to dampen expectations. In today’s Full Story podcast, Bridie
  Jabour talks with the head of newsroom, Mike Ticher, and Guardian Australia’s
  economics editor, Patrick Commins, about whether the Albanese government has
  the ambition for big reform. Listen here: Wait goes on for family of alleged
  DV murder victim Prosecutors have been told to speak to the bereaved family of
  Molly Ticehurst to explain the situation as the case against the man accused
  of her domestic violence murder drags on, 16 months after her death. Daniel
  Billings, 30, is charged with murdering Ticehurst at her home in Forbes,
  central western NSW, in the early hours of April 22, 2024, reports AAP. During
  a brief mention in Parkes local court this morning, Billings’ Legal Aid
  solicitor, Diane Elston, asked for the case to be adjourned, saying
  negotiations between the lawyers were continuing. There would still be “some
  work to do” after the prosecution and defence teams meet later in August, she
  said. Magistrate Brett Thomas agreed to a seven-week adjournment, but
  acknowledged the delay for Ticehurst’s family, who have attended each of
  Billings’ court dates. Prosecutors should “be in contact with them today and
  just explain the situation to them,” Thomas said. PM speaks on 80th
  anniversary of WWII victory in the Pacific Anthony Albanese has honoured
  veterans of the second world war, 80 years on from victory in the Pacific.
  “Part of the debt that we owe to all who served our nation is to remind
  ourselves how close history came to taking a very different path,” the prime
  minister said at a commemorative ceremony in Sydney just now. We think of all
  the stories of courage, of resilience and exhaustion, of fear and elation and
  an endless longing for the home that so many never saw again. These are not
  stories rendered in bronze or marble, but written in flesh and blood, stories
  of ordinary people facing the extraordinary. He continued: They showed us what
  it is to remain true to ourselves no matter what, they showed us what it means
  to stand shoulder to shoulder with friends and allies and together, they
  turned the tide. Read more here: Australian property investors squeezing out
  first-time buyers Property investors borrowed a record sum, nearly $130bn, to
  buy homes over the year to June, supported by interest rate cuts but squeezing
  out first-time buyers. Banks made almost 200,000 new loans to landlords over
  the year, the most since 2022, while the number of new first-home mortgages
  slipped to 116,000, writes Guardian Australia’s Luca Ittimani. Cameron Kusher,
  an independent property expert, said falling interest rates have made
  borrowing easier for mortgage-holding homeowners and investors than for first
  home buyers. “They’re going to get relief on those mortgages in terms of their
  repayments, and they’re going to be the ones that are probably going to
  capitalise on this most,” Kusher said. Read more here: Compliance actions for
  childcare centres as new federal powers enforced Thirty childcare centres have
  been hit with compliance actions over quality and safety issues, as the
  federal government uses its new enforcement powers for the first time,
  threatening to pull commonwealth funding if the providers don’t shape up. The
  education minister, Jason Clare, announced today that his department had
  initiated compliance actions against 30 early childhood education and care
  services after the federal government’s new laws, which passed parliament last
  month. The centres had been identified by the department as having failed to
  meet national quality standards “over seven or more years”, Clare’s office
  said. The enforcement actions don’t relate to child abuse or criminal
  allegations - but go to issues including play area safety, hygiene, staff
  training and supervision. The 30 centres have 48 hours to tell parents about
  the actions, and the names of the centres will be published by the department
  on Tuesday. The centres have six months to improve their standards, or risk
  having their access to the childcare subsidy suspended or cancelled. This
  comes before education ministers meeting next Friday to discuss further safety
  measures, such as a national register of childcare workers and the role of
  CCTV. State and federal attorneys general are also meeting today, with the
  working with children checks system on the agenda. “We have taken action
  swiftly under the new legislation to begin rebuilding confidence in a system
  that parents need to have confidence in. This is not about closing centres
  down, it’s about lifting standards up,” Clare said. “Over the next six months,
  these centres will need to lift their game or they will face further
  consequences including the cutting off of funding.” The early childhood
  education minister, Jess Walsh, added: “We make no apologies for putting
  [child] safety and wellbeing first and foremost.” Sydney restaurant faces
  human rights complaint after keffiyeh incident The Racial Justice Centre is
  preparing to file a group complaint with the Australian Human Rights
  Commission after a Sydney restaurant denied dine-in service to people wearing
  Palestinian keffiyehs during a 20-minute period last weekend. The legal centre
  will file the complaint to Australia’s national anti-discrimination body on
  behalf of six Palestinian complainants, regarding an incident that took place
  on 3 August at the Merivale-owned Jimmy’s Falafel in the Sydney CBD after the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge march, first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald.
  Guardian Australia has spoken to four people, not part of the complaint, who
  report being told they would be barred from eating inside at Jimmy’s Falafel
  unless they removed their keffiyehs. Read more here: For the second
  consecutive quarter in 2025, investment in new wind and solar has fallen well
  short of the pace required to hit Australia’s 2030 renewable energy target.
  Only four projects – totalling 615MW capacity – reached financial close
  between April and June, according to data released today by the Clean Energy
  Council. That brought total new investment in 2025 to 1.17GW – about a third
  of the rate required (6-7 GW per year) for Australia to replace its ageing
  coal power and stay on track for 82% renewables by 2030. Political and policy
  uncertainty during the federal election contributed to the weaker result, the
  report said. The CEC chief policy and impact officer, Anna Freeman, said:
  While we now have renewed confidence in the direction of travel, many chronic
  and structural issues remain unresolved – significant delays in the
  transmission rollout, lengthy and unpredictable environmental and planning
  processes, workforce bottlenecks and a lack of certainty about long-term
  revenue for new projects. This morning, the environment minister, Murray Watt,
  announced he had approved a 135MW solar farm with battery storage in New South
  Wales, at a site adjacent to the Muswellbrook coalmine. Watt said it was the
  97th renewable project approved under the Albanese government. In late July,
  the federal government announced plans to expand its underwriting scheme to
  help accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Council orders Sydney shop
  to remove signage after allegedly using Labubus to promote vapes Sydney’s
  Inner West council has ordered a shop to remove its signage after allegedly
  using a children’s toy to promote vapes. In a social media post, the council
  said it had yesterday sent compliance officers to the Marrickville business
  premises. “Labubye, Marrickville! This sign is gone for good,” the council
  wrote beside before and after photos of the signage. The sign referred to
  Labubus, a hugely popular doll marketed to children. PM praises ‘first dog’
  Toto when asked about Victorian law preventing people being buried with pets
  Ending on a lighter note on ABC radio this morning, Anthony Albanese says
  common sense should apply when asked about a Victorian law that prevents
  people from being buried alongside their pets. Albanese often talks about his
  dog, Toto, a cavoodle he refers to as Australia’s first dog and who often
  accompanies him on his prime ministerial jet around the country. While not
  often one to wade into topics he’s presumably not been briefed on, the prime
  minister let loose on the subject: If people feel close to their pets and they
  want to be buried with them, why would you, why would you stop it? Albanese
  then offered a little bit of insight into how Toto reacts when he gets home to
  The Lodge. The thing about our pets is they give us unconditional love and, no
  matter how difficult my day is, when I come in, there is a little furry friend
  who is absolutely ecstatic and excited to see me. And it takes about 10
  minutes to settle [her] down and that just lifts you up. So, I think that’s
  part of the human condition. So, for goodness sake, whatever that law is,
  should be, a bit of common sense should apply surely. Anthony Albanese says he
  is not in a position to judge whether Israel is directly killing journalists
  in Gaza but said too many innocent lives have been lost. Speaking to ABC radio
  this morning, the prime minister was asked whether he was OK with Israel’s
  killing of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and four of his camera crew
  earlier this week. Israel claimed responsibility for the killings, alleging
  al-Sharif was the leader of a Hamas cell responsible for rocket attacks
  against Israel – an allegation that Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had previously
  dismissed as baseless. Albanese responded: Well, the Israeli government
  themselves say, in this case, there’s one person they say there are
  allegations against. I’m not in a position, obviously, to ascertain the
  veracity of those allegations, but the camera crew killed … with that
  journalist – and there’s been too much loss of innocent lives across the
  board. And that’s why Australia has come to the position that we have, but
  taking a step back as well, if you argue, as Australia has, for a long period
  of time, that there needs to be a two-state solution ... I want to see
  Palestinians and Israelis live in peace and security, and I want to see an end
  to the killing of innocent lives, whether they be Israelis or Palestinians.
  Albanese dismisses US criticism over intention to recognise Palestinian
  statehood Anthony Albanese has dismissed criticism from the US ambassador to
  Israel about Australia’s intention to recognise Palestinian statehood at an
  upcoming UN meeting. The US ambassador, Mike Huckabee, told the ABC’s 7.30
  last night that Australia’s announcement came as a surprise to the US
  administration, adding there had been “an enormous level of disappointment and
  some disgust”. Asked to respond, Albanese told ABC radio his job was to
  represent the interests of Australia and Australians who had been disgusted by
  the deaths of thousands of innocent Palestinians in Gaza: [Australians] were
  disgusted by the terrorist actions of Hamas on October 7, the slaughter of
  innocent Israelis, taking of hostages and the ongoing holding of those
  hostages have outraged Australians, but Australians have also seen the death
  of tens of thousands of people. When you have children starving, when you have
  children losing their lives, with families queuing for food and water, then
  that provokes, not surprisingly, a human reaction. The prime minister
  continued: I’m concerned about Australia’s position, and that is what my role
  is. We’re a sovereign nation, and he’s entitled to put his views, but we’re
  also entitled to put our views. We didn’t do it shyly. I noticed, I saw the
  interview last night. He suggested that this came as a surprise. I spoke with
  prime minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu last Thursday night. I asked him, ‘What
  are, you know, what’s the end point here?’ And the end point is the same as
  the end point that he had put to me more than a year ago, which was, ‘We’re
  going to get rid of Hamas militarily’. There was no political solution there.
  And the idea that you just continue to do more of the same, that you occupy
  Gaza City, that you foreshadowed the conflict which has been opposed by the
  Israeli Defence Force themselves. PM says working with children check system
  is ‘hopeless’ Anthony Albanese has described the existing working with
  children check systems as “hopeless” before a meeting between attorney
  generals this morning to implement a national system. On ABC radio this
  morning, the prime minister was asked why media reports on Tuesday about a
  male childcare worker alleged to have been grooming children, and subsequently
  banned from working in childcare, hadn’t been enough to trigger the removal of
  his working with children check. Albanese said establishing a national system
  and strengthening the screening requirements was a priority at today’s
  attorney generals’ meeting: [The system is] hopeless and we need to do better.
  Quite clearly, and these revelations are a wake-up call for state and
  territory governments in terms of the regulations but also the commonwealth.
  The federal attorney general, Michelle Rowland, is meeting with her
  counterparts this morning to discuss how to harmonise the state and territory
  systems but earlier flagged on ABC radio the process could still take 12
  months. Mark Butler says Penny Wong spoke to Marco Rubio before Palestinian
  statehood announcement The Australian government advised US counterparts of
  its intention to recognise Palestinian statehood before making the decision
  public, Mark Butler has reiterated. The health minister’s comments contradict
  those of the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who last night told the
  ABC the “unilateral” move had been unexpected, ill-timed and had caused an
  “enormous level of disappointment and some disgust”. Butler told Sunrise this
  morning: “There was a discussion between our foreign minister, Penny Wong, and
  Secretary of State Rubio before the announcement … It wasn’t just about the
  situation in Israel and Gaza but also importantly about the main focus of our
  relationship, which of course is security and stability in our own region.” He
  added: The State Department [was] pretty disciplined publishing a read-out
  …that was published very soon after the conversation. So, I am not quite sure
  why the ambassador to Israel says that. There was a conversation. On Monday,
  Wong also said she had spoken “to Secretary Rubio ahead of the announcement
  and, as a matter of diplomatic courtesy, advised him of our intention to
  announce”. Police bust theft ring that targeted major supermarkets Nineteen
  people have been arrested for allegedly shoplifting more than $10m worth of
  goods, after police claimed to have busted one of the largest theft syndicates
  seen in Australia. Victoria police allege the syndicate targeted major
  supermarkets, taking items such as baby formula, medicines, vitamins, skincare
  products, electric toothbrushes and toiletries, reports AAP. “Those arrested
  are predominantly Indian nationals on temporary, student, or bridging visas,”
  the force said this morning. They are alleged to be working in a coordinated
  network to supply stolen goods to ‘receivers’, who then on-sell the products
  to end users for profit. The operation to smash the syndicate was led by the
  Box Hill divisional response unit, which worked with retailers and the
  Australian Border Force. “This has been one of the most significant operations
  we’ve undertaken in recent times to target organised retail theft,” detective
  acting inspector Rachele Ciavarella said. Investigations remain ongoing, with
  further arrests anticipated. Israel’s deputy foreign affairs minister says the
  100,000-plus people who marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge almost a
  fortnight ago in support of ending the Israel-Gaza war were “naive” and
  “useful idiots”. Sharren Haskel told ABC’s Radio National a short time ago: “I
  truly believe that most of this crowd was the same crowd who was gathering
  together since the 8th of October.” She continued: The rest are useful idiots
  that are being used as tools in the hands of those who are trying to promote
  those radical jihadist ideas. And unfortunately, many naive people in
  Australia are falling for a lot of the propaganda of those terrorist
  organisations and those radical jihadist organisations. ‘We loved his wit and
  his sharp insight’: Albanese remembers David Stratton Tributes are pouring in
  for the legendary film critic David Stratton his death at age 85. The prime
  minister, Anthony Albanese, said Stratton had shared his love of cinema with
  the entire nation while co-hosting the television programs The Movie Show and
  At The Movies with fellow critic Margaret Pomeranz. “All of us who tuned in to
  At the Movies respected him for his deep knowledge and for the gentle and
  generous way he passed it on,” Albanese said. We loved his wit and his sharp
  insight, and the deep love of cinema that underpinned it all. And in his
  chemistry with Margaret Pomeranz, he helped deliver one of Australia’s truly
  great TV partnerships. Read more here: Plan to extend Queensland coalmine
  would bulldoze ‘critical’ koala habitat Habitat for threatened koalas that are
  part of a population described by one expert as nationally significant would
  be bulldozed under plans to extend a Queensland coalmine. The campaign group
  Lock the Gate used drones with thermal imaging cameras to find 13 koalas in
  one night in trees earmarked for clearing by mining company Glencore, Graham
  Readfearn writes. Glencore wants to clear 680 hectares of land – including
  600ha of koala habitat – to expand its Hail Creek mine west of Mackay. Read

  obligations regarding defence exports to Israel Michelle Rowland says she is
  confident that Australia is meeting its obligations regarding defence
  approvals for exports of parts for F-35 fighter jets bound for Israel. “This
  is not a case of the Australian government supplying arms. We have taken
  advice, of which I’m not at liberty to disclose, but we have solid advice, and
  we always comply with our international obligations,” the attorney general
  told Radio National. On the subject of starvation in Gaza, she said it was a
  breach of international law to stop food being delivered, “and that’s a
  decision that was made by the government of Israel in March”. “We at all
  times, comply, and we urge compliance with the Geneva convention, with
  international humanitarian law, and as the prime minister said, a disregard
  for the international community’s calls and a failure to comply with legal and
  ethical obligations in this case, cannot be tolerated,” she said. Certainly
  Israel is a democracy in the region. We maintain relations, obviously at that
  level. But as the prime minister himself has clearly said, these were
  difficult conversations that he needed to have with the government of Israel.
  We stand by the statements that we’ve made in terms of recognition – it has
  long been the policy of this government to have a two-state solution. On a
  separate subject, when asked whether she conceded that the absence of a
  national system on working with children checks was placing children at risk
  right now, she answered that it was a risk, “absolutely”. She said a “banned
  in one, banned in all” system for childcare workers would likely be unrolled
  within 12 months. Wastewater reveals Australia’s appetite for illicit drugs at
  record high Analysis of wastewater by the Australian Criminal Intelligence
  Commission, in partnership with universities, has detected a growth in
  consumption of major illicit drugs around the nation. Methylamphetamine (ice),
  cocaine and heroin were all found at record highs in the latest analysis,
  which began in 2016, reports AAP. More than 22 tonnes of those three drugs, as
  well as MDMA (ecstasy), was consumed in Australia in the year to August 2024,
  according to the wastewater analysis. It has boosted the illicit drug trade
  and the profits for organised criminals, with an estimated $11.5bn being
  spent. Ice consumption rose to an estimated 12.8 tonnes. Cocaine use increased
  almost 70%, MDMA almost 50%, and heroin almost 15%. The commission’s drug
  specialist Shane Neilson said the market was rebounding after consumption
  dropped amid tighter border controls and lockdowns during the early years of
  the Covid-19 pandemic. The US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, says he is
  disgusted by Australia joining other key allies in committing to the
  recognition of a Palestinian state. “The timing has been very hurtful to any
  prospects of negotiating some settlement in Gaza with Hamas,” he told the
  ABC’s 7.30 last night. “There’s an enormous level of disappointment and some
  disgust.” He said US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had made it clear the
  result of the action had “been to completely halt any type of thoughtful
  negotiations going forward. And, it’s just a very terrible timing for this to
  come about.” He said he had spoken with Donald Trump about the move and that
  in the meeting, there was an “emotional sentiment, a sense of, ‘You’ve got to
  be kidding. Why would they be doing this, and why would they be doing it now,
  and why [would] they not be telling the United States or telling Israel, for
  that matter, but to go out and make a public announcement like this?’ It was
  unseemly.” He said the president had “done more than anyone” he knows to stop
  the war in Gaza. Two-week search for light plane and its occupants ongoing The
  search for a missing light plane and its two occupants is set to continue off
  the coast of Tasmania. Gregory Vaughan, 72, his partner Kim Worner, 66, and
  their family dog, left George Town airport at about 12.45pm on 2 August but
  the plane has not been sighted, or the Tasmanian couple heard from, since that
  day. Extensive aerial searching yesterday off the state’s north-east coast and
  Flinders Island has not located any sign of a light plane and was hampered by
  poor weather and visibility earlier this week, police said. Improved
  conditions allowed rescuers to continue their search yesterday and police say
  no decision has been made to suspend the search, the area of which is being
  guided by drift modelling. Inspector Craig Fox said the helicopter sweeps did
  not reveal any wreckage or debris that could indicate the location of the
  plane, a small two-seater Bristell S-LSA in distinctive green colour. Good
  morning. Welcome to our lives news coverage this Friday - I’m Daisy Dumas and
  I’ll be guiding you through the headlines. Let’s get going. Australian War
  Memorial to mark 80th anniversary of second world war Australia’s second world
  war dead will be honoured in a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial today
  as the nation marks the 80th anniversary of the conflict, Australian
  Associated Press reports. They will include Warrant Officer Class 2 Frederick
  Balfe Emanuel who died aged 22 weeks before Victory in the Pacific Day on 15
  August, when Japan announced its unconditional surrender to the Allies.
  Emanuel enlisted in the Australian army serving in Papua New Guinea before
  joining the Far Eastern liaison office, where he took part in dangerous
  reconnaissance missions. “His story is a heartbreaking reminder of how close
  some came to seeing peace yet never returned home,” memorial director Matt
  Anderson said. “This is honouring a country boy who became a Sydneysider yet
  did not survive to finish his story.” Other commemorations today include a
  Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon aircraft conducting a flypast over
  the National War Memorial in Adelaide. RSL national president, Greg Melick,
  said the occasion was an important time for Australia to recognise the
  sacrifices of so many fallen soldiers. “For Australians, that day meant that
  the second world war was finally over,” he said. “As the number of veterans
  dwindle, it is vital that we commemorate their collective contribution to our
  liberty and way of life.” BCA says report to provide pathway to help drive
  investment BCA chief executive, Bran Black, said the report calls for
  practical reforms to remove unnecessary red tape to boost investor confidence
  and make it easier to work, trade and do business across Australia. We have
  become too complex a country in which to do business, and that’s a massive
  handbrake on our ability to lift productivity and living standards. At the
  upcoming economic reform roundtable, we have an opportunity to address
  excessive and duplicative rules that impose unnecessary costs on both
  businesses and consumers. As our report show, reducing the red tape burden by
  1% could unlock an extra $1b a year for the economy. Black said the report is
  intended to provide a tangible pathway to help drive investment into
  Australia, which will support businesses to grow, increase job opportunities
  and ultimately boost incomes. In Victoria, a cafe owner needs 36 separate
  licences and approvals before they can pour the first coffee, while a tradie
  on the Gold Coast needs to pay hundreds of dollars in permits just to fix a
  tap over the NSW border, this is the regulation we need to fix. Ahead of next
  week’s productivity summit, the Business Council of Australia has mapped out a
  blueprint for the government to cut Australia’s “$110bn” red tape burden and
  out-of-date regulation. It calls for a 25% reduction in regulatory costs by
  2030 and for the government to undertake a national stocktake of red tape and
  the impact it is having on the economy. Its recommendations include:
  Simplifying compliance and licensing regimes across the country, particularly
  for tradespeople critical to building more homes. Streamlining trading hours
  and practices, and aligning planning and environmental assessments across the
  country; Ensuring laws are fit for the future digital economy to allow a
  faster rollout of AI and cyber innovation. Creating better regulation
  frameworks, which include KPIs for regulators to reduce red tape and
  compliance costs. A major university has announced a plan to “temporarily
  suspend” 140 courses across six faculties. UTS, in a media release, said the
  courses being suspended for new intake were those that have low student
  enrolments. “We want to make sure our curriculum is relevant to what students
  and employers need,” it said. The faculty of design and society appears the
  hardest hit, though the business school, engineering and IT, health, law and
  science are also on the list. This temporary suspension has no impact on
  current students and is aimed only at prospective new students for 2026. The
  university said: The suspensions will be in place until a decision is made on
  the future of these courses following consultation with staff and unions
  through a change proposal process. UTS is one of several Australian
  universities that have recently flagged restructures including job cuts. Good
  morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top
  overnight stories to get you started. Before next week’s economic summit, the
  Business Council of Australia has outlined a vision to relieve business owners
  from what it calls the country’s “$110bn red tape burden” as the federal
  government hunts for a solution to the nation’s withered productivity. More
  coming up. The war in the Pacific ended 80 years ago and a ceremony at the
  Australian War Memorial later today will remember the service personnel who
  gave their lives fighting the Japanese. We have more coming up.

That’s where we’ll wrap the blog up for today, but first: a quick recap of the big events: The University of Technology Sydney has announced a plan to “temporarily suspend” 140 courses across six faculties. The Business Council of Australia has proposed a plan to cut $110bn red tape. Mike Huckabee said he was ‘disgusted’ by Australia’s recognition of a Palestinian state. Israel’s deputy foreign affairs minister said the people who marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of ending the Israel-Gaza war were “naive” and “useful idiots”. Investment in new wind and solar has fallen well short of the pace required to hit Australia’s 2030 renewable energy target. Katy Gallagher identified a ‘worrying trend’ of young men believing there’s ‘too much focus on women’. The attorney general, Michelle Rowland, announced the states have agreed to toughen the Working With Children Checks. Anthony Albanese has declared receiving a gift of a terracotta plaque from Pope Leo and a white felt hat from the Canadian prime minister in his latest update to the parliamentary register of interests. An NT man has died during a police search of his home. About 30 writers and authors have withdrawn from Bendigo writers festival over a code of conduct that requires ‘self-censorship’ over Israel and Gaza. Take care and enjoy your weekend. Greens push for Senate inquiry into early childcare safety The Greens have announced they want a Senate Inquiry into the quality and safety of early childhood education and care as soon as Parliament resumes. Senator Steph Hodgins-May, the Greens spokesperson for early childhood education and care, said in a statement: A national Working With Children Check is long overdue. Whilst its reassuring to know that this will be in place by the end of the year, frankly, this is a decade after it was recommended by the royal commission. Real action means more than introducing a check a decade after it was recommended. It means tackling for-profit cowboys sidelining quality and care in favour of profit, and a workforce in crisis. The Greens are today announcing our intention to establish a Senate inquiry into the quality and safety of early childhood education and care as soon as parliament resumes. We recognise that we cannot keep waiting for these horrific headlines of abuse to take meaningful action. The government must do more than Band-aids. It must sit down with everyone in the parliament willing to prioritise the safety and care of our children and enact meaningful reform to keep our kids safe. A man who died during a police search of his home in the Northern Territory is being investigated as a death in custody. The police officers executing the search warrant in the suburb of Rosebery south-east of Darwin were part of the joint anti-child exploitation team. A 62-year-old man and his wife were at the residence when the search began at 7am, police said in a statement: At approximately 8am, the man obtained a knife from within the residence and stabbed himself multiple times in the chest. Police deployed a taser in an attempt to prevent the man from further harming himself. An officer also received a laceration to his hand while trying to disarm him. Officers provided immediate first aid to the 62-year-old. St John Ambulance also arrived at the scene soon after but the man succumbed to his injuries and was declared deceased at the scene. … Major Crime Investigators remain on scene and the incident is being treated as a death in custody. Lesser welcomes childcare working check reforms and says opposition will hold government to their timetable The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, also appeared on Afternoon Briefing. He welcomed Rowland’s change in the timeline, giving assurance it would be in place before the end of the year: This morning the federal attorney general gave an interview on radio national, where she said this would take a year. We put out a release because we just felt that that was much too long and so, I was very pleased to see the attorneys general across the country saying that they would get this done by the end of the year. …we’ve chosen not to play politics with this and the reason is because I think people are sick of the finger-pointing exercise in relation to these sorts of issues. We have given the government support to do this. We just want to see it get done and we will hold the government to the timetable there. Commissioner says working with children checks need to be stronger Hollonds was asked if she was confident there will be reforms of who can get a Working with Children Check: I think the announcement today does not make this particular screening tool any stronger. It does need to be stronger. It is very basic still. It is mostly about police convictions in the past. And I think the name itself, Working with Children Check kind of gives the impression that it is assessing your suitability to care for children, which it is clearly not. It is just checking whether you have police convictions, in most cases. So you know we really need to do a lot more to be able to assess the suitability of people who want to care for children and so that employers can have the confidence that they are employing the right people and so, the national register of educators that is being proposed is also really, really important. We need to be doing proper referee checks, we need mandatory child safety training on top of their basic early childhood educator training. All of these things will help to strengthen the safeguarding scaffolding that we need, not just in the early childhood sector but beyond. Children’s commissioner welcomes agreement to working with children reforms The national children’s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, says she is “hugely relieved” the national Working With Children Check reforms have been committed to by states and territories. Appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, Hollonds was asked if the plan that they have come up will make children safer. I am hugely relieved at this announcement today and I’m really grateful to the attorney general for her decisive action and her commitment to get this job done and, yes, if this happens, it will absolutely make a difference to the safety of children. Remembering that this is just the first step of a whole range of actions that need to be taken, but it is a very important first step. Around 30 authors and academics have now withdrawn from this weekend’s Bendigo writer’s festival over a speaker code that one says requires “complete self-censorship” over Israel’s war in Gaza. The festival’s code, viewed by Guardian Australia, says speakers should uphold respectful engagements which involves avoiding language or topics that “could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful”. A source told Guardian Australia Bendigo writers’ festival (BWF) sent some speakers the code of conduct on Wednesday – two days before the opening day. The code says that for “La Trobe Presents” panels, speakers must comply with the principles espoused in La Trobe University’s anti-racism plan, including the plan’s definitions of antisemitism and Islamophobia. Academic and author Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, First Nations poet Dr Evelyn Araluen and Wiradjuri writer and poet Jeanine Leane were among the first to have withdrawn from the festival over the code. An updated list of withdrawals, updated by the group Readers and Writers against Genocide, now includes 30 names including Thomas Mayo, Jock Serong, Jess Hill, and Kirstin Ferguson. In a social media post, Ferguson said her decision to withdraw was based on freedom of expression: My decision is not about my personal position on any specific political or social issue, which I have never shared publicly. However, I do hold firm views about the importance of protecting any person’s right to speak on topics important to them - even those topics that may be considered inflammatory, divisive or even disrespectful by some. A spokesperson for the Bendigo writers’ festival said it was “committed to holding an event that engages in respectful debate, open minded discussion, and explores topical and complex issues.” “The festival and presenting partner La Trobe University felt it was necessary to emphasise the importance of safety and wellbeing for all participants by introducing a code of conduct,” the spokesperson said. Academic welcomes ‘powerful statement’ from attorneys general on working with children check Prof Daryl Higgins, the director of Australian Catholic University’s Institute of Child Protection Studies who has long advocated for a national Working With Children Check system, says today’s announcement is a “powerful statement from our attorneys general” but adds that it is a shame it took such “horrific incidents” for the action to be taken. It’s been a long time coming, but it’s pleasing to see the national approach to the Working With Children Check system announced today. The banned in one jurisdiction, banned in all commitment is a powerful statement from our attorneys general that all Australian children deserve the same level of safeguarding. I welcome the commitment to greater information sharing between jurisdictions, but caution that this needs to be carefully implemented to ensure important intelligence does not fall through the cracks. It’s a shame it took such horrific incidents against our most vulnerable members of society, our children, for this action to be taken. We can’t become complacent. We need all governments to continue to work in a bipartisan way to further strengthen systems and hold those who would do our children harm to account. We also need to refocus our attention on primary prevention through better systems of design and improved professional development for childcare educators to empower them to call out anything untoward and to confidently make safeguarding their number one priority. Thanks Daisy for taking us through another big day of news. I’ll be with you for the rest of the afternoon! That’s all from Ima Caldwell and me today – thanks for joining us. I’ll leave you in the hands of the lovely Natasha May for the rest of the day’s breaking news. Wet season forecast shows earlier onset in the east, later in the west The Bureau of Meteorology has released its forecast for Northern Australia’s 2025-26 wet season, starting 1 September. In Queensland rainfall onset is likely to be earlier than normal for most of the state, with an even higher chance in parts of the central interior. The wet season is also forecast to arrive earlier than usual in the Northern Territory, except for parts of its western interior. In Western Australia the rainy season will arrive later than normal for much of the north and west of the state. There is a roughly equal chance of an earlier, later or near-normal onset for areas along the Western Australia–Northern Territory border. Melbourne cinema to pay tribute to ‘one of a kind’ David Stratton Cinema Nova in Melbourne will pay tribute to the late film critic David Stratton, with two free screenings of 1952 classic, Singin’ In The Rain. A statement from David’s family suggested his devotees “celebrate David’s remarkable life and legacy by watching his favourite movie — Singin’ In the Rain.” Speaking about this weekend’s screenings in Stratton’s memory, Cinema Nova co-director, Natalie Miller said in a statement: David was one of a kind. His incredible knowledge of films leaves me in awe. His support of the Australian film industry was amazing, and I am thankful that I knew him professionally and as a friend. And, Australia’s most underrated native animal is … The rakali, or native water rat, has been voted Australia’s most underrated native animal in a poll by ABC Radio National, as part of Science Week 2025. Gathering more than 20% of the 65,000 votes cast, the rakali beat nine other finalists, including the giant cuttlefish, dugong, turtle frog and palm cockatoo. Dr Ann Jones, host of Radio National’s What the Duck?!, said in a statement: The rakali is the quintessential underrated Australian animal – it’s widespread but secretive, it’s fluffy but a kick-arse fighter, it surprises and delights observers and its very presence repels introduced black rats out of its territory. It can travel great distances over land, but swims better than Kieren Perkins (sorry Kieren). The rakali is worthy of this crown. It is more than a rat – it is the Ruler of ALL the Rats. Football fans to set alarms for return of Premier League It’s that time of the year again when diehard football fans prepare for late nights or set their alarm clocks to go off at ungodly hours: the Premier League is back, full of thrills but facing a threat to its superpower, as Barney Ronay writes. The new season kicks off this weekend, with champions Liverpool beginning the defence of their title against Bournemouth in the curtain raiser at 5am AEST on Saturday morning. For the first time, the most-watched league in the world will be broadcast by Nine Entertainment-owned Stan Sports, after Optus Sport transferred its sports streaming rights for a sum of about $300m. Even without Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham despite the Australian coach’s success in the Europa League final, Nine has recognised the broader appeal of the Premier League and will show one game from each of the first three rounds this season on its main free-to-air station Channel Nine. Read more here: Anthony Albanese has declared receiving a gift of a terracotta plaque from Pope Leo and a white felt hat from the Canadian prime minister in his latest update to the parliamentary register of interests. The start of the new parliamentary term, after the election, means all MPs and senators are nearing the deadline to lodge their register of interests, which includes properties, bank accounts, stock holdings and gifts they’ve received. Many have already done so ahead of the deadline, but a number still have their list outstanding. We’ll be bringing you more reporting on those declarations soon. Albanese’s register, published online this week, notes two investment properties - his former home in Marrickville and the Central Coast beach house he purchased with his fiancé, Jodie Haydon, last year, as well as the rental income from both. The prime minister declared he had received gifts including a wooden carving of the famous Indonesian Garuda statue from President Prabowo Subianto, which is displayed in Australia’s embassy in Jakarta. Albanese, who visited Rome for the Pope’s inauguration and met the new pontiff, also received: a carved terracotta plaque; a white felt stetson hat from Mark Carney, Canada’s leader; and a vase and bowl from “Sky News / The Australian”. The PM also noted he’d received tickets to the first and third game of the State of Origin rugby league series from the NRL in May and July. Attorney general promises no standards in child protection scheme will drop as a result of harmonisation Rowland also said the scheme won’t be exactly the same in all states and territories but the government will be aiming to achieve a consistency in standards: When we talk about harmonisation, we are not looking at a scheme to make every single state exactly the same. We are not looking to redo individual state systems. We are looking for consistency. And one of the key points that came about from today’s agreement in SCAG is that no state and territory would be required to lower the ... standards that they have. Now, they are different in between each state and territory and I’m happy for my colleagues, individually, to speak towards that. But the key issue here is that we have agreed that no jurisdiction will be required to lower their standards. To the contrary – we want all standards to lift – to lift across the commonwealth so that we have the most robust scheme. Rowland says working with children reforms have been accelerated Rowland said all states and territories have agreed to “pull out all stops” to ensure the reforms are implemented as soon as possible, bringing forward the the timeline: We took this urgent reform to SCAG [the Standing Council of Attorneys General] as a priority, initially expecting that this could take up to 12 months as a feasible time frame that the commonwealth, states and territories could agree to for implementation. So I’m extremely pleased to accelerate delivery of the reform with states and territories agreeing to working towards implementation by the end of this year. There is a firm commitment from all states and territories to pull out all stops, and we are working together as a team. … This is not a set and forget exercise. We will continue to work together, including in future meet[ings] of SCAG to help keep our young people safe. The attorney general Michelle Rowland is addressing the media after discussing national reforms to Working With Children Checks with state attorney generals: The foremost priority of any government is to keep Australians safe and that particularly extends to the most vulnerable in our community - our young people. And that’s why today, all jurisdictions have agreed to deliver ambitious reforms to address systemic gaps in the Working With Children Checks regime to improve the safety of children across Australia. Attorney generals-today agreed to toughening the system, by ensuring that if you’re banned from holding a working with children check in one jurisdiction, you’re banned in all of them. Banned in one - banned in all. Aussie shares make history with record-breaking streak Australia’s key benchmark index has spiked above 8,900 points for the first time, making five record resets in five sessions for the local bourse, AAP reports. The S&amp;P/ASX200 spiked to a fresh high of 9,177.3, before easing to 8,882.6 points by midday, up 8.8 points, or 0.12%, as the broader All Ordinaries gained 11.9 points, or 0.13%, to 9161. Tony Sycamore, an analyst for IG Markets, said it was a feat “unprecedented over the past decade”. This week’s gains have followed a rally on Wall Street, the Reserve Bank’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut to 3.6% and July’s in-line labour force report, reinforcing the RBA’s cautious 2025 rate cut strategy and teasing further cuts ahead, most likely in November and February. Friday’s relatively steady start came after a flat US session overnight, after producer price growth in the world’s largest economy weighed on expectations of the timing and magnitude of future interest rate cuts. The minister for women, Katy Gallagher, said it is a “worrying trend” that some young men believe women are receiving all the opportunities in a way that is impacting male rights, AAP reports. Gallagher told the Women in Media national conference today: In Australia, our ethos of everyone having a fair go and treating people equally is really strong - certainly across business, community and government. …There is a worrying trend emerging ... particularly with young men thinking that women are getting too much and that their rights are going backwards, and there’s too much focus on women. Sydney Ukrainian community plans to rally ahead of US-Russia meeting Members of Ukraine’s diaspora community are rallying outside the US Consulate in North Sydney Friday afternoon, concerned at the US president’s meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, without the Ukrainian president present. Organiser Anton Bogdanovych told the Guardian the message of the rally is “appeasement doesn’t bring peace”. “Ukrainians and supporters are deeply concerned with the upcoming meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin that is about to happen in Alaska today. The fact that Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, is not invited to this meeting is very disturbing, as it violates the principle: ‘nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine’. “The meeting in Alaska reminds us of the meeting in Munich between the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler that took place in September 1938. The Munich meeting determined the fate of Czechoslovakia - without the leaders of this country being invited - which resulted in the agreement that ceded the Sudetenland to Germany. “We all remember that soon after the Munich agreement Germany, emboldened by it, started World War II.” Ukrainians in Sydney are rallying outside the US Consulate in Miller Street, North Sydney from 4:30pm, Bogdanovych said, “to warn US officials and the world about the dangers of repeating the mistakes of the past”. Can Labor jumpstart the economy? Next week the Albanese government will bring together business leaders, unions and interest groups at an economic roundtable to discuss how to best jumpstart the economy. Big ideas such as a four-day work week and limiting negative gearing have been put forward, but the prime minister has been quick to dampen expectations. In today’s Full Story podcast, Bridie Jabour talks with the head of newsroom, Mike Ticher, and Guardian Australia’s economics editor, Patrick Commins, about whether the Albanese government has the ambition for big reform. Listen here: Wait goes on for family of alleged DV murder victim Prosecutors have been told to speak to the bereaved family of Molly Ticehurst to explain the situation as the case against the man accused of her domestic violence murder drags on, 16 months after her death. Daniel Billings, 30, is charged with murdering Ticehurst at her home in Forbes, central western NSW, in the early hours of April 22, 2024, reports AAP. During a brief mention in Parkes local court this morning, Billings’ Legal Aid solicitor, Diane Elston, asked for the case to be adjourned, saying negotiations between the lawyers were continuing. There would still be “some work to do” after the prosecution and defence teams meet later in August, she said. Magistrate Brett Thomas agreed to a seven-week adjournment, but acknowledged the delay for Ticehurst’s family, who have attended each of Billings’ court dates. Prosecutors should “be in contact with them today and just explain the situation to them,” Thomas said. PM speaks on 80th anniversary of WWII victory in the Pacific Anthony Albanese has honoured veterans of the second world war, 80 years on from victory in the Pacific. “Part of the debt that we owe to all who served our nation is to remind ourselves how close history came to taking a very different path,” the prime minister said at a commemorative ceremony in Sydney just now. We think of all the stories of courage, of resilience and exhaustion, of fear and elation and an endless longing for the home that so many never saw again. These are not stories rendered in bronze or marble, but written in flesh and blood, stories of ordinary people facing the extraordinary. He continued: They showed us what it is to remain true to ourselves no matter what, they showed us what it means to stand shoulder to shoulder with friends and allies and together, they turned the tide.

Banks made almost 200,000 new loans to landlords over the year, the most since 2022, while the number of new first-home mortgages slipped to 116,000, writes Guardian Australia’s Luca Ittimani. Cameron Kusher, an independent property expert, said falling interest rates have made borrowing easier for mortgage-holding homeowners and investors than for first home buyers. “They’re going to get relief on those mortgages in terms of their repayments, and they’re going to be the ones that are probably going to capitalise on this most,” Kusher said.

The education minister, Jason Clare, announced today that his department had initiated compliance actions against 30 early childhood education and care services after the federal government’s new laws, which passed parliament last month. The centres had been identified by the department as having failed to meet national quality standards “over seven or more years”, Clare’s office said. The enforcement actions don’t relate to child abuse or criminal allegations - but go to issues including play area safety, hygiene, staff training and supervision. The 30 centres have 48 hours to tell parents about the actions, and the names of the centres will be published by the department on Tuesday. The centres have six months to improve their standards, or risk having their access to the childcare subsidy suspended or cancelled. This comes before education ministers meeting next Friday to discuss further safety measures, such as a national register of childcare workers and the role of CCTV. State and federal attorneys general are also meeting today, with the working with children checks system on the agenda. “We have taken action swiftly under the new legislation to begin rebuilding confidence in a system that parents need to have confidence in. This is not about closing centres down, it’s about lifting standards up,” Clare said. “Over the next six months, these centres will need to lift their game or they will face further consequences including the cutting off of funding.” The early childhood education minister, Jess Walsh, added: “We make no apologies for putting [child] safety and wellbeing first and foremost.” Sydney restaurant faces human rights complaint after keffiyeh incident The Racial Justice Centre is preparing to file a group complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission after a Sydney restaurant denied dine-in service to people wearing Palestinian keffiyehs during a 20-minute period last weekend. The legal centre will file the complaint to Australia’s national anti-discrimination body on behalf of six Palestinian complainants, regarding an incident that took place on 3 August at the Merivale-owned Jimmy’s Falafel in the Sydney CBD after the Sydney Harbour Bridge march, first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald. Guardian Australia has spoken to four people, not part of the complaint, who report being told they would be barred from eating inside at Jimmy’s Falafel unless they removed their keffiyehs.

Only four projects – totalling 615MW capacity – reached financial close between April and June, according to data released today by the Clean Energy Council. That brought total new investment in 2025 to 1.17GW – about a third of the rate required (6-7 GW per year) for Australia to replace its ageing coal power and stay on track for 82% renewables by 2030. Political and policy uncertainty during the federal election contributed to the weaker result, the report said. The CEC chief policy and impact officer, Anna Freeman, said: While we now have renewed confidence in the direction of travel, many chronic and structural issues remain unresolved – significant delays in the transmission rollout, lengthy and unpredictable environmental and planning processes, workforce bottlenecks and a lack of certainty about long-term revenue for new projects. This morning, the environment minister, Murray Watt, announced he had approved a 135MW solar farm with battery storage in New South Wales, at a site adjacent to the Muswellbrook coalmine. Watt said it was the 97th renewable project approved under the Albanese government. In late July, the federal government announced plans to expand its underwriting scheme to help accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Council orders Sydney shop to remove signage after allegedly using Labubus to promote vapes Sydney’s Inner West council has ordered a shop to remove its signage after allegedly using a children’s toy to promote vapes. In a social media post, the council said it had yesterday sent compliance officers to the Marrickville business premises. “Labubye, Marrickville! This sign is gone for good,” the council wrote beside before and after photos of the signage. The sign referred to Labubus, a hugely popular doll marketed to children. PM praises ‘first dog’ Toto when asked about Victorian law preventing people being buried with pets Ending on a lighter note on ABC radio this morning, Anthony Albanese says common sense should apply when asked about a Victorian law that prevents people from being buried alongside their pets. Albanese often talks about his dog, Toto, a cavoodle he refers to as Australia’s first dog and who often accompanies him on his prime ministerial jet around the country. While not often one to wade into topics he’s presumably not been briefed on, the prime minister let loose on the subject: If people feel close to their pets and they want to be buried with them, why would you, why would you stop it? Albanese then offered a little bit of insight into how Toto reacts when he gets home to The Lodge. The thing about our pets is they give us unconditional love and, no matter how difficult my day is, when I come in, there is a little furry friend who is absolutely ecstatic and excited to see me. And it takes about 10 minutes to settle [her] down and that just lifts you up. So, I think that’s part of the human condition. So, for goodness sake, whatever that law is, should be, a bit of common sense should apply surely. Anthony Albanese says he is not in a position to judge whether Israel is directly killing journalists in Gaza but said too many innocent lives have been lost. Speaking to ABC radio this morning, the prime minister was asked whether he was OK with Israel’s killing of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and four of his camera crew earlier this week. Israel claimed responsibility for the killings, alleging al-Sharif was the leader of a Hamas cell responsible for rocket attacks against Israel – an allegation that Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had previously dismissed as baseless. Albanese responded: Well, the Israeli government themselves say, in this case, there’s one person they say there are allegations against. I’m not in a position, obviously, to ascertain the veracity of those allegations, but the camera crew killed … with that journalist – and there’s been too much loss of innocent lives across the board. And that’s why Australia has come to the position that we have, but taking a step back as well, if you argue, as Australia has, for a long period of time, that there needs to be a two-state solution ... I want to see Palestinians and Israelis live in peace and security, and I want to see an end to the killing of innocent lives, whether they be Israelis or Palestinians. Albanese dismisses US criticism over intention to recognise Palestinian statehood Anthony Albanese has dismissed criticism from the US ambassador to Israel about Australia’s intention to recognise Palestinian statehood at an upcoming UN meeting. The US ambassador, Mike Huckabee, told the ABC’s 7.30 last night that Australia’s announcement came as a surprise to the US administration, adding there had been “an enormous level of disappointment and some disgust”. Asked to respond, Albanese told ABC radio his job was to represent the interests of Australia and Australians who had been disgusted by the deaths of thousands of innocent Palestinians in Gaza: [Australians] were disgusted by the terrorist actions of Hamas on October 7, the slaughter of innocent Israelis, taking of hostages and the ongoing holding of those hostages have outraged Australians, but Australians have also seen the death of tens of thousands of people. When you have children starving, when you have children losing their lives, with families queuing for food and water, then that provokes, not surprisingly, a human reaction. The prime minister continued: I’m concerned about Australia’s position, and that is what my role is. We’re a sovereign nation, and he’s entitled to put his views, but we’re also entitled to put our views. We didn’t do it shyly. I noticed, I saw the interview last night. He suggested that this came as a surprise. I spoke with prime minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu last Thursday night. I asked him, ‘What are, you know, what’s the end point here?’ And the end point is the same as the end point that he had put to me more than a year ago, which was, ‘We’re going to get rid of Hamas militarily’. There was no political solution there. And the idea that you just continue to do more of the same, that you occupy Gaza City, that you foreshadowed the conflict which has been opposed by the Israeli Defence Force themselves. PM says working with children check system is ‘hopeless’ Anthony Albanese has described the existing working with children check systems as “hopeless” before a meeting between attorney generals this morning to implement a national system. On ABC radio this morning, the prime minister was asked why media reports on Tuesday about a male childcare worker alleged to have been grooming children, and subsequently banned from working in childcare, hadn’t been enough to trigger the removal of his working with children check. Albanese said establishing a national system and strengthening the screening requirements was a priority at today’s attorney generals’ meeting: [The system is] hopeless and we need to do better. Quite clearly, and these revelations are a wake-up call for state and territory governments in terms of the regulations but also the commonwealth. The federal attorney general, Michelle Rowland, is meeting with her counterparts this morning to discuss how to harmonise the state and territory systems but earlier flagged on ABC radio the process could still take 12 months. Mark Butler says Penny Wong spoke to Marco Rubio before Palestinian statehood announcement The Australian government advised US counterparts of its intention to recognise Palestinian statehood before making the decision public, Mark Butler has reiterated. The health minister’s comments contradict those of the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who last night told the ABC the “unilateral” move had been unexpected, ill-timed and had caused an “enormous level of disappointment and some disgust”. Butler told Sunrise this morning: “There was a discussion between our foreign minister, Penny Wong, and Secretary of State Rubio before the announcement … It wasn’t just about the situation in Israel and Gaza but also importantly about the main focus of our relationship, which of course is security and stability in our own region.” He added: The State Department [was] pretty disciplined publishing a read-out …that was published very soon after the conversation. So, I am not quite sure why the ambassador to Israel says that. There was a conversation. On Monday, Wong also said she had spoken “to Secretary Rubio ahead of the announcement and, as a matter of diplomatic courtesy, advised him of our intention to announce”. Police bust theft ring that targeted major supermarkets Nineteen people have been arrested for allegedly shoplifting more than $10m worth of goods, after police claimed to have busted one of the largest theft syndicates seen in Australia. Victoria police allege the syndicate targeted major supermarkets, taking items such as baby formula, medicines, vitamins, skincare products, electric toothbrushes and toiletries, reports AAP. “Those arrested are predominantly Indian nationals on temporary, student, or bridging visas,” the force said this morning. They are alleged to be working in a coordinated network to supply stolen goods to ‘receivers’, who then on-sell the products to end users for profit. The operation to smash the syndicate was led by the Box Hill divisional response unit, which worked with retailers and the Australian Border Force. “This has been one of the most significant operations we’ve undertaken in recent times to target organised retail theft,” detective acting inspector Rachele Ciavarella said. Investigations remain ongoing, with further arrests anticipated. Israel’s deputy foreign affairs minister says the 100,000-plus people who marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge almost a fortnight ago in support of ending the Israel-Gaza war were “naive” and “useful idiots”. Sharren Haskel told ABC’s Radio National a short time ago: “I truly believe that most of this crowd was the same crowd who was gathering together since the 8th of October.” She continued: The rest are useful idiots that are being used as tools in the hands of those who are trying to promote those radical jihadist ideas. And unfortunately, many naive people in Australia are falling for a lot of the propaganda of those terrorist organisations and those radical jihadist organisations. ‘We loved his wit and his sharp insight’: Albanese remembers David Stratton Tributes are pouring in for the legendary film critic David Stratton his death at age 85. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Stratton had shared his love of cinema with the entire nation while co-hosting the television programs The Movie Show and At The Movies with fellow critic Margaret Pomeranz. “All of us who tuned in to At the Movies respected him for his deep knowledge and for the gentle and generous way he passed it on,” Albanese said. We loved his wit and his sharp insight, and the deep love of cinema that underpinned it all. And in his chemistry with Margaret Pomeranz, he helped deliver one of Australia’s truly great TV partnerships.

The campaign group Lock the Gate used drones with thermal imaging cameras to find 13 koalas in one night in trees earmarked for clearing by mining company Glencore, Graham Readfearn writes. Glencore wants to clear 680 hectares of land – including 600ha of koala habitat – to expand its Hail Creek mine west of Mackay.

We have taken advice, of which I’m not at liberty to disclose, but we have solid advice, and we always comply with our international obligations,” the attorney general told Radio National. On the subject of starvation in Gaza, she said it was a breach of international law to stop food being delivered, “and that’s a decision that was made by the government of Israel in March”. “We at all times, comply, and we urge compliance with the Geneva convention, with international humanitarian law, and as the prime minister said, a disregard for the international community’s calls and a failure to comply with legal and ethical obligations in this case, cannot be tolerated,” she said. Certainly Israel is a democracy in the region. We maintain relations, obviously at that level. But as the prime minister himself has clearly said, these were difficult conversations that he needed to have with the government of Israel. We stand by the statements that we’ve made in terms of recognition – it has long been the policy of this government to have a two-state solution. On a separate subject, when asked whether she conceded that the absence of a national system on working with children checks was placing children at risk right now, she answered that it was a risk, “absolutely”. She said a “banned in one, banned in all” system for childcare workers would likely be unrolled within 12 months. Wastewater reveals Australia’s appetite for illicit drugs at record high Analysis of wastewater by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, in partnership with universities, has detected a growth in consumption of major illicit drugs around the nation. Methylamphetamine (ice), cocaine and heroin were all found at record highs in the latest analysis, which began in 2016, reports AAP. More than 22 tonnes of those three drugs, as well as MDMA (ecstasy), was consumed in Australia in the year to August 2024, according to the wastewater analysis. It has boosted the illicit drug trade and the profits for organised criminals, with an estimated $11.5bn being spent. Ice consumption rose to an estimated 12.8 tonnes. Cocaine use increased almost 70%, MDMA almost 50%, and heroin almost 15%. The commission’s drug specialist Shane Neilson said the market was rebounding after consumption dropped amid tighter border controls and lockdowns during the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic. The US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, says he is disgusted by Australia joining other key allies in committing to the recognition of a Palestinian state. “The timing has been very hurtful to any prospects of negotiating some settlement in Gaza with Hamas,” he told the ABC’s 7.30 last night. “There’s an enormous level of disappointment and some disgust.” He said US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had made it clear the result of the action had “been to completely halt any type of thoughtful negotiations going forward. And, it’s just a very terrible timing for this to come about.” He said he had spoken with Donald Trump about the move and that in the meeting, there was an “emotional sentiment, a sense of, ‘You’ve got to be kidding. Why would they be doing this, and why would they be doing it now, and why [would] they not be telling the United States or telling Israel, for that matter, but to go out and make a public announcement like this?’ It was unseemly.” He said the president had “done more than anyone” he knows to stop the war in Gaza. Two-week search for light plane and its occupants ongoing The search for a missing light plane and its two occupants is set to continue off the coast of Tasmania. Gregory Vaughan, 72, his partner Kim Worner, 66, and their family dog, left George Town airport at about 12.45pm on 2 August but the plane has not been sighted, or the Tasmanian couple heard from, since that day. Extensive aerial searching yesterday off the state’s north-east coast and Flinders Island has not located any sign of a light plane and was hampered by poor weather and visibility earlier this week, police said. Improved conditions allowed rescuers to continue their search yesterday and police say no decision has been made to suspend the search, the area of which is being guided by drift modelling. Inspector Craig Fox said the helicopter sweeps did not reveal any wreckage or debris that could indicate the location of the plane, a small two-seater Bristell S-LSA in distinctive green colour. Good morning. Welcome to our lives news coverage this Friday - I’m Daisy Dumas and I’ll be guiding you through the headlines. Let’s get going. Australian War Memorial to mark 80th anniversary of second world war Australia’s second world war dead will be honoured in a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial today as the nation marks the 80th anniversary of the conflict, Australian Associated Press reports. They will include Warrant Officer Class 2 Frederick Balfe Emanuel who died aged 22 weeks before Victory in the Pacific Day on 15 August, when Japan announced its unconditional surrender to the Allies. Emanuel enlisted in the Australian army serving in Papua New Guinea before joining the Far Eastern liaison office, where he took part in dangerous reconnaissance missions. “His story is a heartbreaking reminder of how close some came to seeing peace yet never returned home,” memorial director Matt Anderson said. “This is honouring a country boy who became a Sydneysider yet did not survive to finish his story.” Other commemorations today include a Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon aircraft conducting a flypast over the National War Memorial in Adelaide. RSL national president, Greg Melick, said the occasion was an important time for Australia to recognise the sacrifices of so many fallen soldiers. “For Australians, that day meant that the second world war was finally over,” he said. “As the number of veterans dwindle, it is vital that we commemorate their collective contribution to our liberty and way of life.” BCA says report to provide pathway to help drive investment BCA chief executive, Bran Black, said the report calls for practical reforms to remove unnecessary red tape to boost investor confidence and make it easier to work, trade and do business across Australia. We have become too complex a country in which to do business, and that’s a massive handbrake on our ability to lift productivity and living standards. At the upcoming economic reform roundtable, we have an opportunity to address excessive and duplicative rules that impose unnecessary costs on both businesses and consumers. As our report show, reducing the red tape burden by 1% could unlock an extra $1b a year for the economy. Black said the report is intended to provide a tangible pathway to help drive investment into Australia, which will support businesses to grow, increase job opportunities and ultimately boost incomes. In Victoria, a cafe owner needs 36 separate licences and approvals before they can pour the first coffee, while a tradie on the Gold Coast needs to pay hundreds of dollars in permits just to fix a tap over the NSW border, this is the regulation we need to fix. Ahead of next week’s productivity summit, the Business Council of Australia has mapped out a blueprint for the government to cut Australia’s “$110bn” red tape burden and out-of-date regulation. It calls for a 25% reduction in regulatory costs by 2030 and for the government to undertake a national stocktake of red tape and the impact it is having on the economy. Its recommendations include: Simplifying compliance and licensing regimes across the country, particularly for tradespeople critical to building more homes. Streamlining trading hours and practices, and aligning planning and environmental assessments across the country; Ensuring laws are fit for the future digital economy to allow a faster rollout of AI and cyber innovation. Creating better regulation frameworks, which include KPIs for regulators to reduce red tape and compliance costs. A major university has announced a plan to “temporarily suspend” 140 courses across six faculties. UTS, in a media release, said the courses being suspended for new intake were those that have low student enrolments. “We want to make sure our curriculum is relevant to what students and employers need,” it said. The faculty of design and society appears the hardest hit, though the business school, engineering and IT, health, law and science are also on the list. This temporary suspension has no impact on current students and is aimed only at prospective new students for 2026. The university said: The suspensions will be in place until a decision is made on the future of these courses following consultation with staff and unions through a change proposal process. UTS is one of several Australian universities that have recently flagged restructures including job cuts. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories to get you started. Before next week’s economic summit, the Business Council of Australia has outlined a vision to relieve business owners from what it calls the country’s “$110bn red tape burden” as the federal government hunts for a solution to the nation’s withered productivity. More coming up. The war in the Pacific ended 80 years ago and a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial later today will remember the service personnel who gave their lives fighting the Japanese. We have more coming up.
