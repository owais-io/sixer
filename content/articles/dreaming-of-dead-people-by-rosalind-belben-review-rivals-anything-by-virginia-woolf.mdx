  There’s no getting around it: Dreaming of Dead People is an extremely strange
  book. Born in 1941, Rosalind Belben was first published in the 1970s; this,
  her fourth novel, first came out in 1979. Her eighth and most recent, Our
  Horses in Egypt, won the James Tait Black award in 2007. Dreaming of Dead
  People might best be described as an early example of autofiction: its
  narrator, Lavinia, is the same age as Belben was at the time of writing, and
  she recalls a similar childhood in Dorset, including a father who was a Royal
  Navy commander and who was killed when she was three. Belben has described the
  book as “a study of the human figure”, and given its parallels with her own
  life story and its raw and deeply personal style any reader could be forgiven
  for assuming that the figure is her own. The book is divided into six very
  different sections, including a stay in Venice, a treatise on masturbation, a
  description of a beloved dog’s euthanasia and a vivid erotic daydream
  involving Robin Hood. It is hard, at first, to understand how these parts
  relate to one another, for this uncompromising book offers few obvious clues,
  but on second reading they shift and merge, and the payoff for this extra
  mental and imaginative effort is a truthful and vivid portrait of a highly
  particularised human consciousness. In the first section, At Torcello, Lavinia
  recalls a trip to the Venetian island in winter. She is there to see a
  Byzantine mosaic of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, an image of motherhood
  that will echo through the book. While she is on the island she meets an
  English family for whom she will later babysit during a power cut, her
  relationship to children and the idea of family coming slowly into focus.
  Torcello and Venice itself are made strange by the things she notices, and by
  her attitude to them, both at the time and in recollection: a pregnant dog, a
  miserable rat, a canal’s water, “dull of eye”. “In that sour and barren place,
  a spinster, who did not wish for the dry, un-rustling grass. I weep with
  mortification. Yet I was extremely happy.” Belben’s angular syntax, frequent
  ellipses and unusual punctuation force the reader to slow down, think, and pay
  attention. It becomes clear that Lavinia is full of regrets. Having nursed her
  mother through a long final illness, she has not had sex for 10 years and
  wonders if others now see her as “not among the fuckers of this world”. She
  had assumed she would marry and have children, but nobody ever proposed; in
  today’s world, of course, she would not consider herself “a shrivelled person
  … an old maid” at 36, but things were different in the 1970s, something which
  makes her lack of shame all the more remarkable: “I have woken sopping and
  swollen, with a devil to suppress between my legs.” If this novel is as
  confessional as it seems, it is truly fearless: death, ageing, anorgasmia,
  loneliness, despair and madness are all here, jostling for attention, just as
  they do for many of us, for all we may seek to tune them out. Meanwhile,
  Lavinia learns to masturbate with an electric toothbrush. The Robin Hood
  section is a change of gear so abrupt it risks whiplash. As a child Lavinia
  identified with the idea of a forest-dwelling outlaw (“the myth of the
  greenwood … a cosy, complete, limited life”), and loved books about children
  who live outdoors: BB’s classic Brendon Chase and Arthur Ransome’s Swallows
  and Amazons also form part of the fantasy. But this book is no fairy story,
  instead a sensuous, funny account of a sexual encounter between Hood and the
  wife of Sir Richard atte Lee, a figure from early medieval ballads. This is a
  vision of sexuality as pure, natural and incorruptible, a vital component in
  what today’s pop psychologists might call Lavinia’s “love map”. As the
  sections unfold, a succession of images and recollections relentlessly and
  obliquely illuminate one another in the manner of an Adam Curtis film. We
  glimpse Lavinia’s relationship with her beloved but complicated mother
  (“something stiff and unyielding, fierce and loving”) and learn more about her
  deep affinity for animals, particularly horses and dogs, both subjects of
  Belben’s own later books; we understand her attitude to death, and to London;
  see the damage inflicted by her schooling, and witness her sustaining, at
  times ecstatic relationship with the natural world (her account of a trip to
  Scotland beats nearly all of today’s nature writing into a cocked hat). She
  imagines the daughter she might have had, and names her “Jessie”, but dwells
  uneasily on the very different childhood she would doubtless have compared
  with her own: “She would reckon a Forestry Commission plantation is a nice
  wood to walk in … she wouldn’t have a clue about apples, how to pick them, how
  to store them: or pears.” You can feel Lavinia/Belben thinking and imagining
  her way through something that she might otherwise have had the opportunity to
  understand in practice: the inevitable distance between generations and the
  inexorable pace of change. “I am worried that Jessie won’t read,” she writes
  [italics her own]. “It would be my greatest dread.” The last pages of Dreaming
  of Dead People dissolve into an impressionistic but carefully structured
  stream of consciousness, dwelling on ageing and mortality, loneliness and
  inner strength: extraordinary from any writer, but particularly from one in
  only her middle 30s. It is extremely beautiful, utterly convincing, and rivals
  anything by Virginia Woolf. “There comes a time for making peace with
  oneself,” Belben writes, as Lavinia. “Life as I have known it is ending. I am
  drying up … I am saying: here is a life, what do you make of it. And trying
  not to mind that you turn aside.” • Dreaming of Dead People by Rosalind Belben
  is published by And Other Stories, (£14.99). To support the Guardian, order
