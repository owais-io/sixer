  Jonas Vingegaard’s latest attempt to escape the constant shadow of Tadej
  Pogacar and reboot his status as a Grand Tour winner kicks off this Saturday
  at the Vuelta a España. The Dane’s two-year Grand Tour drought – his last
  success was in the 2023 Tour de France – has been marked by a near-fatal crash
  and some occasionally unseemly jostling for leadership within his Visma–Lease
  a Bike team . Key to Vingegaard’s Vuelta ambitions is the absence of a
  world-weary Pogacar, last spotted on his bike wearing a jersey sporting the
  messages “Do Not Disturb” and “No Photography” while watching his partner,
  Urska Zigart, race to second overall in the recent Tour of Romandie Féminin.
  In the aftermath of his fourth Tour de France win, Pogacar has spoken openly
  about the end of his career. “I’m already counting down to retirement,” the
  26-year-old said. “I began winning early, so I know there can also be seasons
  with fewer results. But I will probably ride a few more Tours. It’s the
  biggest race and I doubt the team will leave me out.” With the intense
  transfer speculation surrounding Remco Evenepoel having ended – the Olympic
  road and time trial champion will join Red Bull Bora-Hansgrohe next season –
  the Belgian is skipping the Vuelta in favour of next month’s Tour of Britain.
  For Vingegaard, who needs to revive a career that is in danger of withering on
  the vine through a growing sense of inconsistency and underachievement, the
  Vuelta presents an ideal opportunity. But even without Pogacar starting, the
  greatest threat to him is likely to come from the Slovenian’s UAE Emirates
  team, who have Juan Ayuso and João Almeida in their lineup. The 22-year-old
  Ayuso has all the qualities to win a Grand Tour but has yet to deliver, while
  Almeida, who crashed out of the Tour, is another rider who excels in shorter
  stage races, but seems less sure of himself over three weeks. Others,
  including the Briton Tom Pidcock, are seeing the Vuelta’s mix of steep, sharp
  climbs and technical sprints as a chance to further enhance their season.
  Pidcock began the year duelling with Pogacar at Strade Bianche and is among
  the pack of opportunists seeking both stage wins and a strong overall finish.
  The 26-year-old, whose Q36.5 team did not qualify for the Tour de France but
  who finished 16th in this year’s Giro d’Italia, said that he is “curious to
  see what I can do in the general classification”. That marks a shift in
  mentality for the double Olympic gold medallist, who in the past admitted that
  he didn’t see himself as having the necessary mindset for such a goal.
  Pidcock’s former team Ineos Grenadiers come to the Vuelta led by the 2019
  yellow jersey winner Egan Bernal, and hoping to build on their two stage wins
  in July’s Tour, while also avoiding any more revelations centred on the
  under-investigation carer David Rozman. If Bernal is to reach the podium in
  Madrid, he will need to race with a more strategic mindset than he did in
  May’s Giro, when an erratic performance took him to seventh overall, the
  team’s best result in a Grand Tour since Geraint Thomas finished third in the
  2024 edition of the Italian race. But, having missed out on snagging
  Evenepoel, the British team continue to lag behind the big three, Vingegaard’s
  Visma–Lease a Bike, Pogacar’s UAE Emirates and Evenepoel’s new sponsor, Red
  Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe. Dave Brailsford has reportedly frozen all transfer
  activity and, even if the soon-to-be-retired Thomas imminently assumes a
  managerial role within the Grenadiers, the often-cited “period of transition”
  continues. This being the Tour of Spain, the race begins, of course, in Italy,
  with an opening quartet of stages zigzagging from Turin to Novara and then
  across to France, before a long transfer to Figueres, where the convoy finally
  reaches Spain. A team time trial, an individual time trial and six summit
  finishes, including the dreaded climbs of Angliru and the teetering Bola del
  Mundo, are allied to the usual smattering of tricky hilly stages and fast
  sprints. As usual, the decisive moments will come in the steepest mountains,
  ostensibly Vingegaard’s forte. In the absence of the rider regularly touted as
  the “GOAT”, it will be down to the Dane to seize the day.
