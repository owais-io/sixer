  Martin Kettle rightly says Aneurin Bevan is the one politician other than
  Clement Attlee whom Labour leaders regularly invoke (Critics say Starmer is no
  Attlee – and they’re right. Labour must look to the future, not the past, 31
  July). Keir Starmer has drawn on Harold Wilson for inspiration, but more
  pertinent to Kettle’s argument is David Lammy claiming a role model in Ernest
  Bevin. Made minister of labour in 1940 and foreign secretary in 1945, Ernie
  Bevin dominated the decade. Bevin sought a continued US military presence in
  Europe but had no illusions about the “special relationship”. The 1956 Suez
  crisis was a calamitous reality check, confirming the White House’s
  prioritising of US self-interest above any presumed obligation to an ally,
  however close. Larry Elliott’s pessimism over Trump’s trade deal with Europe
  is understandable (This trade deal is the EU’s Suez moment – its subservience
  to Trump is on show for all to see, 31 July), but the EU can take heart from
  how France responded to the United States torpedoing its joint effort with the
  UK to regain control of the Suez canal: a renewed commitment to pan-European
  economic collaboration saw the swift confirmation of a six-nation common
  market, and a determination that French foreign policy would never again be
  subject to transatlantic pressure saw the Fourth and then the Fifth Republic
  develop its own advanced weaponry, both conventional and nuclear. Had Attlee,
  not Eden, been prime minister in 1956, we can be certain that he would never
  have sanctioned collusion with France and Israel to invade Egypt, and then
  repeatedly denied having done so. Attlee’s greatest quality wasn’t
  succinctness – it was integrity. Adrian Smith Emeritus professor of modern
  history, University of Southampton • I do not feel Martin Kettle is entirely
  fair or correct to say that Clement Attlee, on becoming prime minister,
  “pulled Britain out of India as fast as he could”. Attlee had been closely
  involved in India for more than 20 years, going back to the Simon commission,
  which had been established in 1927, specifically to consider the possibility
  of Indian independence and self-rule. As an MP and a member of the commission,
  Attlee visited India several times before the war (no mean feat in those
  days), understood the issues and knew the leaders of the political parties and
  factions. He did not underestimate the problems that independence might bring
  (although certainly not the violence and bloodshed), noting that partition
  would “necessarily leave minorities in both states” but emphasising that his
  Labour government was “in earnest in seeking to implement the promises made by
  Britain”. Eighty years on, another Labour prime minister now faces similar
  challenges over Palestine. I am sure Keir Starmer, like his distinguished
  predecessor, will rise to the occasion. Robert Evans Former chair of the south
  Asia delegation, European parliament • Martin Kettle’s interesting article on
  Clement Attlee referred to his wife driving him to Buckingham Palace to meet
  King George VI on his historic 1945 victory over Churchill. Mrs Attlee was
  apparently a notoriously bad driver. My late father told me Mrs Attlee once
  collided with his car when driving the prime minister on a foggy night in
  London. Fortunately, no one was injured. Robin Arnfield Vancouver, Canada •
