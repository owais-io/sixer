  With bigger and stronger wildfires becoming more common as Europe swelters in
  record-breaking heat, people will need to adapt and learn how to stay safe.
  How deadly are wildfires? Wildfires directly kill hundreds of people around
  the world each year. Though they may seem apocalyptic, the death toll is far
  lower than from floods, which kill thousands, and from heatwaves, which kill
  hundreds of thousands. But when you factor in smoke, the human cost rises
  rapidly. The latest study estimates that the air pollution spewed by wildfires
  kills a staggering 1.5 million people each year. The toxic fumes can reach so
  far that tendrils of smoke from Australian bushfires have menaced South
  America, while smoke from Canadian fires – which regularly suffocate cities
  across the US – have fouled the air in Europe. What causes wildfires? Many
  things can spark a wildfire: natural causes such as lightning, faulty
  infrastructure such as downed power lines, or people behaving badly.
  Devastating blazes in recent years have been started by smokers tossing
  cigarette butts, tourists failing to put out campfires, and even arsonists
  intentionally setting nature alight. But whether those sparks turn into small
  fires or raging blazes depends on the weather. Fires need hot, dry fuel to
  burn, and they spread further with strong winds. How does climate breakdown
  affect wildfires? Fossil fuel pollution has heated the planet by about 1.3C,
  raising the risk of prolonged heat that turns forests and grasslands into
  tinderboxes. In some regions, such as the Mediterranean, global heating is
  also fuelling droughts that dry out lush greenery. Scientists have found that
  such shifts have made the wildfires that have happened this year in places
  including California, South Korea and Australia more likely – in some cases
  doubling the chance of extreme weather conditions that help fires spread. Are
  wildfires getting worse? Even as the planet has heated up, the area torched by
  fires has fallen. This is because people have taken nature that used to burn
  freely and turned it into farms or cities – in recent decades mainly in Africa
  – that stop the spread of flames. The latest models find land use changes and
  other human drivers have shrunk the burned area by 19.1% since 1900, while
  climate changes increased it by 15.8% – resulting in a small decline of 3.3%
  overall. Will wildfires become more common? The conditions for ferocious fires
  are expected to worsen as the planet bakes. Two separate indices of fire
  weather project a steady rise in the number of days with high fire danger as
  temperatures inch higher, a recent study found. By the end of the century, the
  total burned area is projected to rise by 40% even in an optimistic scenario
  for cutting carbon pollution, according to a separate study. In a worst-case
  scenario, it is set to double. How can we adapt to wildfires? The danger that
  wildfires pose to people and property can drop sharply by managing land
  better. This can include creating fire breaks to stem the spread of an
  inferno, stopping new settlement in places prone to fires, and even sending
  herds of goats into abandoned farmland to graze away overgrown vegetation. In
  some places firefighters are trying the technique of intentionally burning
  land to avoid a buildup of fuel that could lead to catastrophic fires – a
  long-running Indigenous practice in Australia and North America that European
  fire experts are starting to adopt. How can I stay safe during a wildfire? If
  you live somewhere at risk of wildfires, put a plan together before disaster
  strikes. This could include identifying safe routes and nearby shelters, and
  packing an emergency bag. Some fire services recommend creating a safe zone
  around your home that is free from leaves and flammable materials. Experts say
  you should vacate immediately if authorities tell you to – or if your home is
  at risk but warnings have not come. To avoid the smoke, keep windows closed
  and use respirator masks.
