  Automatic promotion contenders This week the tussle between Birmingham City
  and Ipswich Town, who meet in the curtain-raiser on Friday, to sign Chuba
  Akpom – the runaway top scorer in the division with Middlesbrough three years
  ago (Viktor Gyökeres was runner-up) – was tantamount to both sides taking it
  in turns to flex their muscles. Despite a sole Premier League win this
  calendar year, Ipswich were relegated with more decorum than Leicester City
  and Southampton and Kieran McKenna’s side are armed to attack the second tier,
  even if Omari Hutchinson joins Liam Delap in departing. The 40-year-old Ashley
  Young, who worked with McKenna at Manchester United, looks a smart pickup and
  consistency can help Ipswich to flourish. Birmingham, meanwhile, are aiming to
  repeat a feat last achieved by Ipswich in winning successive promotions and
  have not been shy in reinforcing Chris Davies’s squad, but there is also
  momentum from a record-breaking season. Leicester are at risk of a points
  deduction but their new head coach, Martí Cifuentes, took 32 players on the
  pre-season tour to Austria and has the tools to overpower opponents. The
  landscape of his squad will probably look different next month – the same
  applies at Southampton where a flurry of departures are expected – but, unlike
  last season, neither are likely to be caught short. For Will Still, the
  returning Gavin Bazunu and Shea Charles could be key pillars at Saints. Eleven
  teams have changed managers since the end of last season – 15 since the turn
  of the year – but few transitions were as messy as Rúben Sellés replacing
  Chris Wilder at Sheffield United, playoff finalists last season. Selles, who
  has reunited with Louie Barry, with whom he worked at Hull City last season,
  has the bones of a strong squad but will need to hit the ground running to win
  over the Bramall Lane faithful. One of those coaches who arrived midway
  through last campaign will fancy his chances of kicking on: Frank Lampard
  revived Coventry City, driving them into the playoffs. The arrival of the
  goalkeeper Carl Rushworth, on loan from Brighton, addresses a problem
  position, though they are short of a prolific goalscorer – the Gyökeres
  sell-on fee may help. Playoff hopefuls Millwall felt an uplift after Alex Neil
  was appointed last December and his team are primed to go close again after
  finishing eighth last season, with Alfie Doughty their standout summer
  signing. Derby County could be dark horses under John Eustace, who has proved
  his ability as a shrewd manager at this level and plans to fuse experience
  with youth; Rhian Brewster, 25, could prove a revelation if he can rediscover
  his goalscoring touch after joining on a free. Whether West Brom are in the
  mix under Ryan Mason, as he begins his first permanent job as a No 1, may
  hinge on their marquee summer signing Aune Heggebø firing after arriving from
  Brann. After an underwhelming season, Norwich City have sold their top scorer
  Borja Sainz to Porto, while Josh Sargent – arguably the best striker in the
  division last term – is also poised to depart. Norwich had a soft centre last
  season and have revamped things with Liam Manning joining as head coach and 11
  signings, including the 21-year-old striker Jovon Makama from Lincoln and the
  imposing Serbia midfielder Mirko Topic. This is Middlesbrough’s ninth
  successive season in the division and Steve Gibson has turned to Rob Edwards
  in search of promotion. Stoke City, too, have been stuck in the second tier –
  and fortunate to avoid dropping into the third – but Mark Robins has
  strengthened with defensive additions Aaron Cresswell and Maksym Talovierov,
  who impressed for Plymouth after signing in January. Swansea City’s
  highest-profile summer arrival has been Snoop Dogg, joining Luka Modric as a
  minority shareholder, but Alan Sheehan is aiming to build on the promise shown
  after taking the reins in February, initially on an interim basis. Swansea
  have made some sensible additions including Ethan Galbraith, who excelled for
  Leyton Orient, but probably need another striker unless Bobby Wales – born in
  Dublin, signed from the Scottish club Kilmarnock and now playing in England’s
  second tier – proves a hit. Bristol City squeezed into sixth on the final day
  last season and while Emil Jakobsen looks an upgrade on Nahki Wells, they do
  not look stronger under Gerhard Struber, last seen in this division in tears
  after staving off relegation behind closed doors with Barnsley in 2020. John
  Swift has signed for hometown club Portsmouth, who can build on 16th under the
  impressive John Mousinho. Charlton and Wrexham have been aggressive in the
  market after promotion and have cause to look up, towards mid-table, rather
  than down; for the latter, Danny Ward, Conor Coady, Lewis O’Brien and Kieffer
  Moore represent a promising spine. Relegation candidates After a summer exodus
  it is over to Henrik Pedersen, Danny Röhl’s former assistant, to pick up the
  pieces at Sheffield Wednesday, a club shrouded in uncertainty amid further
  turbulence under Dejphon Chansiri. There is crisis around every corner at
  Hillsborough, where the North Stand has been closed because of structural
  concerns, and the remaining players spent much of pre-season training on an
  artificial pitch amid delays at their Middlewood Road training base. The
  longstanding captain, Barry Bannan, has agreed to stay but aside from his
  commitment positives have been hard to come by. Wednesday fans are united,
  however, with the supporters’ trust planning a protest at Leicester on Sunday,
  their opening game, where the team will be backed by a sold-out away end.
  Hull, like Wednesday, are prohibited from spending fees on players until
  January 2027 – both clubs are appealing against that ruling – and after
  staying up on goal difference things look ominous for the the lowest scorers
  of last season; Sergej Jakirovic is the fifth managerial hire since Acun
  Ilicali took ownership three years ago. Blackburn Rovers missed out on the
  playoffs on the final day last season but were punching above their weight and
  look light on quality after Callum Brittain joined Boro. Oxford United, who
  spent pre-season in Indonesia, where Gary Rowett rode a model lion in line
  with local tradition, and Paul Heckingbottom’s Preston face an uphill task,
  but both are canny operators. Stability has been elusive at QPR and Watford –
  both of whom have new managers without EFL experience in Julien Stéphan and
  Paulo Pezzolano respectively – and could find the going tough. Three
  youngsters to watch Jeremy Monga, Leicester, 16 One of few green shoots from
  last season, the England Under-16 winger became the second-youngest player in
  Premier League history (behind Ethan Nwaneri) when he made his debut aged 15
  years and 271 days in April; gambling regulations meant he wore a blank shirt
  because Leicester’s home kit was sponsored by a cryptocurrency platform.
  Tracked by elite clubs across Europe, but has agreed to sign a professional
  contract when he turns 17 next July. Mihailo Ivanovic, Millwall, 20 The Serbia
  striker is one of the most exciting talents in the division and will quietly
  fancy his chances of the golden boot – if he stays put. Ivanovic, who signed
  from Vojvodina on deadline day last summer, scored 12 league goals last season
  – 10 since the turn of the year – including a sumptuous trivela at Luton. The
  forward got a chipped pass under his spell with his left shoulder, controlled
  the ball with his right boot and then flung a nonchalant strike into the far
  corner. Jay Robinson, Southampton, 18 Last season it was Tyler Dibling given a
  chance to impress after lighting up pre-season and now it could be the turn of
  another attacking midfielder. Robinson, like Dibling, represented the
  under-21s at 15. The former QPR youngster, first elevated to the first team by
  Russell Martin, has been a fixture in friendlies this summer and there is a
  sense that a regular spot awaits. He started the final game of last season
  after his debut in April, the month he signed a new four-year contract.
