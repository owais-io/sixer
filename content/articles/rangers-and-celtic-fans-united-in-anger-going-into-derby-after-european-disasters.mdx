  Never in the history of a derby stretching back to May 1888 and more than 400
  matches has the backdrop been as bizarre as this. The yin-and-yang nature of
  football in Glasgow means supporters of Celtic must be happy because those
  following Rangers feel dismay, or vice versa. Very occasionally there is
  general contentment, as in recent times when Rangers could draw kudos from
  European progress to offset domestic disappointment. As the sides head for
  Ibrox on Sunday there is outrage. Widespread, collective outrage. In Russell
  Martin and Brendan Rodgers, we have managers who do not feel compatible with
  their clubs. Victory for either side in the first Old Firm clash of the season
  would douse dissenting voices only momentarily. Embarrassment came in
  different forms for Celtic and Rangers in Europe this week but it was
  embarrassment nonetheless. Followers of both clubs can be unrealistic in their
  analysis and demands. In the current context, they are quite right to voice
  disquiet. Celtic’s scenario is the more complex and bewildering. Rangers
  simply appear to have erred in the appointment of Martin. He had very little
  leeway with the Rangers support from the outset and the disorganised shambles
  that was the 6-0 loss to Club Brugge on Wednesday further inflamed opinion.
  Rangers were lucky to escape with that level of defeat. Much is said of
  Martin’s philosophy but a manager who cannot implement basic defensive
  principles can have no excuses. Rangers’ signing policy is wholly
  unconvincing. The case for Martin surviving surrounds Rangers’ American owners
  not being as susceptible to deafening mood music as others before them. The
  same custodians would also have to admit their first key hire was a disastrous
  one. There is nothing in Martin’s demeanour or output to suggest he can
  oversee what would be a remarkable change in fortune. This job looks as if it
  will swallow him up. “The noise is the loudest I have ever had to deal with as
  a coach or a player,” Martin admitted. “You have to accept that being here and
  I knew it would be the case. This job isn’t for the timid. It’s not my job to
  speculate on or worry about what people on the outside think.” Rodgers
  returned to Celtic in 2023 with progress in Europe in mind. Domestic dominance
  was virtually guaranteed. Progress to the knockout phase of last season’s
  Champions League – where Celtic were unlucky not to defeat Bayern Munich –
  boosted Celtic’s standing. Since then, there has been regression; key players
  sold, replacements not sourced. A club with supposedly risk-averse custodians
  – plus an estimated £100m in the bank – gambled on the biggest prize of all
  and lost after failing to score against Kairat Almaty over 210 minutes. Celtic
  will arguably antagonise angry supporters even further by signing players –
  none of whom should have been out of reach in June – post-Champions League
  exit. Rodgers has made his frustrations clear since pre-season, albeit he has
  gradually toned them down. He has refused to confirm that his club are aligned
  on transfer strategy. The curious thing is that the Irishman has been in this
  movie before, making agitation plain long before a move from Celtic to
  Leicester six years ago. On what basis did he return to Glasgow and what
  change in approach did he expect? Champions League qualifying rounds have
  tripped Celtic up seven times since 2014 (in two subsequent seasons they did
  not play in them). On Friday Rodgers stressed harmony within Celtic and talked
  of a board that “bleeds for the club”. He said: “It is not about investment.
  This club will invest. The club is super-well run. What we need to look at is
  the timing of investment.” Failings are collective. Rodgers is far from
  blameless. Celtic even in diminished form had enough to see off Kairat. The
  manager’s transfer dealings from last summer – when Arne Engels, Paulo
  Bernardo, Auston Trusty and Adam Idah arrived for close to £30m – have not
  affected the starting team to anything like an acceptable extent. Presumably
  Tony Bloom did not anticipate opportunity arriving so early after the purchase
  of a 30% stake in Hearts – and the Edinburgh club are not yet positioned to
  seize upon it anyway – but muddled decisions in Glasgow are proving that the
  English billionaire may just have backed the right horse again. Supporters of
  other Scottish clubs will mock, as is their right. Week to week, the Old Firm
  lord it over those with a fraction of their resources. Yet big-picture terms
  are hardly appealing. Losses for Aberdeen and Hibernian on Thursday placed
  further dents in an unimpressive European coefficient. Some chickens are
  coming home to roost, including in respect of the national team, for a
  Scottish Premiership that places next to no emphasis on youth development. All
  focus at Ibrox will be on relieving tensions. Just do not expect that to be
  the case for long beyond 90 inevitably exhausting minutes.
