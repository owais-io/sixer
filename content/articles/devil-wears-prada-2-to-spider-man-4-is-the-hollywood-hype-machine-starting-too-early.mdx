  Devil Wears Prada 2 to Spider-Man 4: is the Hollywood hype machine starting
  too early?

  Do you want to know who might be starring, cameoing or in some way appearing
  in the upcoming sequel to The Devil Wears Prada? Well, you might not have a
  choice. Ever since filming on the Anne Hathaway/Meryl Streep reunion commenced
  in New York a few weeks ago, set photos and accompanying news items have
  become plentiful (don’t click that link if you don’t want to know the rumors
  about a major star). Of course, gossip pages breathlessly reporting casting
  rumors are not sanctioned by a movie studio, like a teaser, poster, trailer or
  announcement video. At the same time, the movie hype machine has been blurring
  the line between genuine marketing and tweet-grade micro-teases all summer
  long. For example: is there a teaser trailer for next summer’s Spider-Man:
  Brand New Day? It’s the next Marvel movie after this July’s Fantastic Four
  reboot, and plenty of summer blockbusters-to-be have called their shots with a
  teaser a year in advance, so it would make sense to get a little something out
  there. A teaser is kinda-sorta what Sony posted a few weeks ago, only it was
  hyped up as a “suit reveal”, which seems like an attempt to redress a
  20-second teaser in literal new clothes. It also seems like a backfire if the
  strategy involves anyone beyond the most diehard 5% of movie-watchers
  realizing or caring that Tom Holland walks up to the camera wearing a
  Spider-Man costume that is slightly different than the six other Spider-Man
  costumes he’s donned in other appearances. There is also a behind-the-scenes
  video of a movie that’s barely started filming. It recalls the absurdly
  lengthy “chair reveal” of cast members from Avengers: Doomsday parceled out
  over five hours, which is getting its own sequel soon. (Not everyone was
  announced, of course. Not least because the movie’s screenplay was not
  finished at the time of that announcement and filming commencement.) Even
  Christopher Nolan, who has generally mastered the art of keeping his highly
  anticipated movies to the realm of teasers and trailers – a teaser for his
  Imax-shot version of The Odyssey emerged just about a year before its planned
  July 2026 release – succumbed to the hype machine when that Odyssey teaser was
  accompanied by tickets for select showtimes going on sale. That’s right, if
  you want to plan a movie outing 50 weeks from now, you can see about booking
  an Odyssey ticket at your local Imax (if applicable). Or rather, you could
  have if your AMC app didn’t crash; most of those showings sold out quickly. To
  some extent, this is business as usual. There’s been year-out hype for movies
  for literal decades at this point; Alien 3 had a teaser trailer that
  infamously teased a movie with a completely different premise (Aliens on
  Earth?!). Some of it is also just the studios attempting to compete with the
  speed and ferocity of digital-era hype, to be heard above the constant buzz of
  phone notifications over virtually nothing (as well as the semi-regular global
  calamity). After all, the days of getting by on trailers, posters and TV ads
  alone are long gone, right? Maybe not. The biggest global opening of the past
  weekend was the horror movie Weapons, which exceeded expectations for its
  launch based largely off of ... trailers that explained the premise of the
  movie. Obviously there’s more to a marketing campaign than that. In the
  spring, the film launched a website mocked up to look like news postings about
  Maybrook, the fictional town in the movie, with shades of The Blair Witch
  Project from 1999. But the baseline of the movie’s marketing was a couple of
  trailers that showed a lot of creepy imagery but said little about the
  multi-character plot beyond what the movie reveals in its first two minutes:
  one night, a group of third-graders from the same class mysteriously rise from
  their beds, run outside, and disappear into the night. The movie is about
  figuring out what happened to them; no casting announcements, announcement
  videos, or greetings from the set needed. For well over a year, about the only
  thing anyone repeated about this movie in the Hollywood trade publications was
  that it was a “horror epic” with some elements in common with another 1999
  classic, Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia. Of course, Weapons operated with the
  luxury of less attention from both its studio and the outside press. It’s not
  the kind of superhero movie or high-profile sequel that gets clicks a year
  before it comes out. But this strategy isn’t only employed for smaller films.
  Disney’s Lilo &amp; Stitch remake, the second-biggest global hit of the year
  so far, certainly had plenty of promotion, tie-ins, brand activations and so
  on. But it successfully waited until much closer to its release date, putting
  out a couple of traditional low-footage teasers at the end of 2024, and a full
  trailer a few months before the movie’s release in 2025. Sinners, an ambitious
  movie with an audience more in line with Weapons, also managed to avoid
  selling much-hyped nothingburgers, and was able to take audiences by surprise.
  Next year’s crop of much-hyped sequels will still probably draw crowds.
  Streep, Hathaway, Nolan, Spider-Man and whoever is in the Avengers these days
  all have plenty of fans. But the rush to blow up what would normally be lines
  in a press release to an epic and ceremonious scale still feels sweaty – maybe
  sweatier, even, as if companies including Disney are desperate to project the
  image of day-stopping news when another name of an old X-Men cast member turns
  up on a chair. As recently as the release of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, the
  company prized spoiler protection, with almost none of the movie’s various
  in-joke cameos signaled ahead of time. That seemed like good marketing, but
  maybe it was just fear of the fact that many of those cameos were
  intentionally expectations-undermining jokes, rather than mega-applause
  moments. It’s harder to tell in retrospect because the hype machine has spent
  so much time accidentally eliminating the difference between teasers, spoilers
  and piles of random crumbs.
