  Labour has settled claims brought by 20 people, mainly former staffers, who
  featured in a leaked internal document about antisemitism in the party, with
  the costs estimated to be close to £2m. The settlements include a payout to
  Labour’s former elections chief Patrick Heneghan, who was falsely accused in
  the dossier of having tried to sabotage Jeremy Corbyn’s chances of winning the
  2017 general election. It is understood the payouts will total just under £1m,
  but with Labour paying both sides’ legal fees the cost to the party will be
  near to £2m. This puts the total legal costs for Labour connected to the
  dossier at more than £4m, with court documents released last year showing the
  party spent £2.4m on its own eventually abandoned lawsuit pursuing five
  separate staffers it accused of being behind the leak. The 800-page document
  was produced under Corbyn’s leadership. It was billed as being part of a
  submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission for the rights
  watchdog’s inquiry into antisemitism within Labour, but it was never
  submitted. It was anonymously leaked and included hundreds of private WhatsApp
  messages from named staff detailing hostility towards Corbyn and his allies.
  The report said factional hostility contributed to an ineffective handling of
  antisemitism complaints, and set out claims of anti-black racism,
  Islamophobia, sexism and bullying. The 20 people whose cases have been settled
  took action over alleged defamation or the unauthorised use of personal data,
  or both. Six opted to be named, including Heneghan, who had previously
  labelled the idea that he sabotaged the 2017 election a “stab-in-the-back”
  conspiracy theory. A statement by the named claimants’ legal team, read to the
  court, said this claim was among a series of false allegations against
  Heneghan. Also named was Labour’s former head of governance John Stolliday,
  who took action over the leak of private messages and what the statement
  called “false and damaging” allegations that he tried to obstruct action on
  antisemitism in order to undermine Corbyn. A staffer in the governance unit,
  Fraser Welsh, took action over similar claims. Another named party was Joe
  Goldberg, then a Labour councillor in Haringey, north London. The statement to
  the court said the leaked document made “wholly untrue” claims that Goldberg
  was Islamophobic and had tried to smear another party member with an unfounded
  allegation of antisemitism. Another payout went to Ben Santhouse, who had made
  a confidential complaint to the party about alleged antisemitism and was then
  named in the leaked report as “a vexatious complainant who made
  disproportionate and unfounded allegations of antisemitism against
  individuals”, claims that the document read to the court said were defamatory.
  According to the claimants, as well as not being told about the fact their
  private messages and emails were being leaked, the dossier in some cases used
  the messages to create misleading narratives. In the wake of the furore over
  the leaked dossier, Labour under Keir Starmer’s leadership commissioned a
  report by the senior lawyer Martin Forde KC. Published in 2022, it concluded
  that destructive infighting within the party under Corbyn’s tenure meant
  antisemitism was often used as a “factional weapon” by his critics, and then
  denied by his supporters. It also said that while some staff at HQ had
  covertly run an alternative campaign that included directing resources to
  anti-Corbyn Labour MPs, and this was “wrong”, their aim had not been for
  Labour to lose the 2017 election, and it was “highly unlikely” that the
  diversion of resources into this operation caused the loss. The Forde report
  said the leaked report was itself a factional document with an agenda to
  advance; however, it did not agree with claims that derogatory messages in the
  leaked dossier were “cherrypicked and selectively edited”. In June last year,
  Labour withdrew legal action against five former staff members, including
  Corbyn’s former chief of staff Karie Murphy and his former director of
  communications Seumas Milne, who were accused of leaking the report. All of
  the five, also comprising Georgie Robertson, Laura Murray and Harry Hayball,
  had vehemently denied being responsible. The Forde report said it had been
  unable to determine who leaked the document. Separate to the dossier, in 2020
  the party apologised to seven former employees and a BBC journalist after
  admitting it had defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation
  into its handling of antisemitism. The settlement to the ex-staff and the
  reporter John Ware was believed to have cost Labour about £600,000. It
  retracted claims by the party that the whistleblowers were motivated by
  opposition to Corbyn and that Ware had acted misleadingly. A Labour
  spokesperson said: “The party welcomes the resolution of this matter.” It is
  understood the latest claims were settled before last year’s general election,
  although the details have only been set out now. The party did not comment on
  the payouts or costs. • This article was amended on 20 August 2025. An earlier
  version incorrectly quoted the Forde report saying it was “highly unlikely”
  party staff sought to sabotage the 2017 election. In fact, the report said it
  was “highly unlikely” the diversion of resources caused Labour’s election
  loss; it found separately that staff had not sought to sabotage the election
  result.
