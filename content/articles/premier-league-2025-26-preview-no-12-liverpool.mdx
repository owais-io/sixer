  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 1st (NB: this is not necessarily Andy
  Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 1st Prospects Champions for a record-equalling 20th time, and by a
  comfortable margin, first-choice transfer targets secured in an ambitious
  recruitment drive and the possibility of Alexander Isak arriving too:
  Liverpool look in outstanding shape to celebrate their 21st title this season.
  A seventh Champions League triumph will also be considered a realistic target
  by Arne Slot. Expectations are high at Anfield but any analysis of the club
  must consider the immeasurable impact of Diogo Jota’s tragic death on
  teammates and colleagues. It is the unknown factor in their title defence. On
  paper Liverpool have upgraded the squad that won the Premier League with four
  matches to spare and handed Slot greater depth and versatility for his second
  season. The head coach rotated sparingly in the league and his approach was
  rewarded handsomely. Slot, however, felt that fatigue caught up with the team
  during a sequence of 30 matches between November and March and he should have
  made more changes for the Carabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle. Expect more
  rotation this season. Liverpool have added pace in both full-back positions
  with the signings of Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong, two parts of a
  statement transfer window when they spent almost £300m. Hugo Ekitiké was
  signed from under Newcastle’s noses after a breakthrough season with Eintracht
  Frankfurt and the coveted Florian Wirtz arrived for a club record – and
  potentially British record – fee. Slot believes the Germany international will
  bring “a few extra weapons” to the side. Rich in attacking options, Liverpool
  by contrast appear light in central defence and will require another imperious
  campaign from Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. The pair were a formidable
  unit last season. The defending champions appear the same. The manager There
  is a stark contrast between the character of the Liverpool head coach and the
  manager he succeeded last summer but, thanks to his tactical brilliance and
  calm, grounded manner, Slot exceeded expectations in evolving the squad built
  by Jürgen Klopp. History was made as a result. Slot made the best start by any
  Liverpool manager with 11 wins in his first 12 games, became the first Dutch
  coach to win the Premier League and joined the Anfield greats Joe Fagan and
  Sir Kenny Dalglish in winning the title in his first season. After the tragic
  events of the summer, the 46-year-old said: “To represent this club in this
  city now even means more to me and to my wife than it did before.” Off-field
  picture It has been a devastating summer for Liverpool after the deaths of
  Jota and his brother André Silva in a car accident on 3 July. The Portugal
  international was one of the most down-to-earth and popular figures in the
  dressing room, as well as a brilliant finisher who won the Premier League and
  Nations League in the weeks before his death. The grass verge behind the Main
  Stand at Anfield became a sea of tributes to the 28-year-old, who married his
  long-term partner Rute Cardoso, the mother of their three young children, 11
  days before the accident. Liverpool have permanently retired Jota’s No 20
  shirt in his honour across all levels of the club and have plans for a
  permanent memorial. Star signing A certain Newcastle striker could make a late
  play for this title but, in the meantime, it is Wirtz who embodies Liverpool’s
  ambition and willingness to pay a record fee for a transformative signing. The
  champions beat off competition from Bayern Munich and Manchester City for the
  22-year-old attacking midfielder, who also had interest from Real Madrid. Slot
  believes Wirtz’s creativity will compensate for Trent Alexander-Arnold’s exit
  and enable Liverpool to turn dominance in possession into more emphatic
  victories. Wirtz has looked a class act in pre-season, the former Bayer
  Leverkusen player’s passing, touch, awareness and ability to find pockets of
  space in and around the penalty area impressing. Stepping up With impeccable
  timing, the 16-year-old left-winger Rio Ngumoha shone in a pre-season friendly
  against Yokohama F. Marinos on the day Luis Díaz completed his £65.5m move to
  Bayern. A fine display capped by an excellent individual goal showed Slot
  there could be another option to replace the Colombian. Ngumoha repeated the
  trick in his next outing against Athletic Bilbao. Chelsea were furious when
  Ngumoha left for Liverpool last summer. The teenager, for his part, felt there
  was a more straightforward pathway to the first team at Anfield. He will sign
  his first professional contract when he turns 17 on 29 August. A big season
  for Alexander-Arnold’s departure creates an opening for Conor Bradley to
  establish himself as the first-choice right-back. However, any prospect of a
  straightforward promotion for a 22-year-old who has all the attributes for the
  job, and the experience of 57 appearances for Liverpool, was curtailed days
  after the Premier League trophy was lifted. The champions announced the £29.5m
  signing of Frimpong on the day they accepted a €10m package from Madrid for
  Alexander-Arnold’s early release. The competition for Bradley remains as
  fierce as ever, but an opportunity is there to be seized.
