  In 2015 – which has now come to be seen as the peak of Europe’s migration
  crisis – nearly 1 million asylum seekers tried to reach the continent by
  perilous journeys over land and sea. Most were refugees fleeing the Syrian
  civil war, but many also came from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and other
  countries across the Middle East and Africa. In doing so they would test the
  core values of the European Union, itself an organisation that grew out of the
  ashes of a war that displaced millions. Ten years on, Guardian reporter
  Lorenzo Tondo catches up with one Syrian refugee who reflects on the 4,400km
  journey he undertook to Germany, and how his life has progressed since. Also
  as part of our big story package, the Guardian’s European community affairs
  correspondent Ashifa Kassam reports on the growing wave of anti-migrant
  vigilantes in Europe and what their emergence signifies. And Nesrine Malik’s
  excellent commentary explores the cyclical and escalating nature of
  anti-immigration rhetoric and policy, especially in the UK and US. Nesrine
  argues that the issue is deliberately manipulated by politicians, with the
  goalposts constantly shifting so no measure, no matter how extreme, can ever
  satisfy the demand for “fewer” immigrants. Special offer: get 12 editions of
  the Guardian Weekly for just £/$/€12 *** Five essential reads in this week’s

  year, the US president is pushing extraordinary measures to ensure the
