  There is a very real danger that, in its bid to reform the planning system and
  build 1.5m homes across England at pace, the government will neglect the basic
  requirements of livable communities (‘No shops, no schools’: homes in England
  built without basic amenities, 27 July). As your article makes clear, already
  “thousands of homes across England are being built without urgently needed
  community infrastructure”. The planning system cannot allow such fundamental
  aspects of quality, sustainable placemaking to be neglected. It would do well
  to recognise the solution offered by a landscape-led approach to development.
  Landscape is everywhere – not just in protected countryside, but in every high
  street and cul-de-sac. It is the setting in which we all live, study, work and
  play. By thinking landscape first and engaging landscape architects early,
  planners and developers can design-in essential community infrastructure from
  the outset, creating resilient places that deliver what people need. So, let’s
  build quality as well as quantity by prioritising landscape. Carolin Göhler
  President, Landscape Institute • One of the problems with the way we build
  homes in England is that local people have no role beyond complaining and
  objecting. In one case in your article, the community offered to finish off
  and run a community centre if the developer would just build the shell. But
  the idea that communities could roll up their sleeves and build, own, run
  these things just isn’t considered by our housing and planning systems. The
  developer considered and rejected the idea; the community had no say. In a
  small but growing number of places this opposite is happening. Communities are
  gaining a seat at the table in the design and build-out of new homes, and
  taking ownership of shops, playgrounds, open space, community centres and
  affordable homes. Developers have to work with, and negotiate with, local
  people over what is built. This little bit of leverage and agency, achieved
  through a community land trust, builds better places with a stronger sense of
  community. The Labour government has talked a lot about supporting
  communities. The prime minister recently spoke of people tired of being
  excluded from decisions about their own lives. Here’s your chance, Sir Keir,
  to include them in decisions about housing by wiring community agency and
  ownership into the planning system. Tom Chance Chief executive, Community Land
