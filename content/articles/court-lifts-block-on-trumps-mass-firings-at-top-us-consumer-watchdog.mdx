  A federal appeals court set the stage for the Trump administration to resume
  firings at the top US consumer watchdog, ruling in a split decision that a
  lower court lacked jurisdiction in temporarily blocking the mass layoffs. The
  ruling will not take immediate effect, the court said on Friday, to allow
  lawyers representing workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and
  consumer groups to file for a review of the case by the full circuit court of
  appeals for the District of Columbia. The ruling is the latest twist in the
  legal battle over the fate of the CFPB, as the Trump administration has tried
  to fire 1,500 of the agency’s 1,700 employees. The agency has returned more
  than $21bn to US consumers since its founding. Russell Vought, director of the
  office of management and budget and the architect of Project 2025, the
  rightwing blueprint drawn up ahead of Trump’s re-election, was appointed
  acting director of the CFPB in February. The Trump administration has yet to
  nominate a permanent candidate for the director role since withdrawing its
  previous nominee in May. US circuit judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both
  Trump appointees, ruled in favor of the administration on Friday. The district
  court behind the initial decision “lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims
  predicated on loss of employment”, the majority wrote. In a dissent, circuit
  judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed by Barack Obama, said the lower
  court had acted properly in blocking the Trump administration from eradicating
  the CFPB entirely as the lawsuit played out. Pillard wrote: “It is
  emphatically not within the discretion of the President or his appointees to
  decide that the country would benefit most if there were no Bureau at all.”
  Senator Elizabeth Warren, ranking member of the Senate banking, housing, and
  urban affairs committee who played a significant role in the creation of the
  CFPB, said: “Today’s divided panel decision willfully ignores the Trump
  administration’s unprecedented and lawless attempt to destroy an agency
  created by Congress that has helped millions of families across the country.”
  The ruling was described as a “disgrace” by Cat Farman, president of the CFPB
  union. “It empowers Donald Trump to unilaterally eliminate vital public
  services established by Congress. Without a functioning CFPB, there is less
  oversight of the biggest banks, which means more fraud and less help for
  veterans and the elderly who are major targets for financial scams.” Farman
  added: “[CFPB workers] aren’t giving up our fight to defend the rule of law
  from executive overreach and protect the hard-earned paychecks of working
  people from Wall Street greed.” Reuters contributed reporting
