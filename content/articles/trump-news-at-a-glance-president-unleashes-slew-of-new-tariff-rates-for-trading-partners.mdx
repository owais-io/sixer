  Donald Trump has signed an executive order placing tariffs on dozens of US
  trading partners just hours before the 1 August deadline he set for deals to
  be done. The new tariffs, the next step in his trade agenda that will test the
  global economy, are set to go into effect in seven days. The extension
  reflects the government’s need for more time to harmonize the tariff rates, AP
  reports, according to a senior official who spoke to reporters on condition of
  anonymity. The order applies to 68 countries and the 27-member European Union.
  Rates were set at 25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan, 19% for
  Thailand and 15% for South Korea. Trump also increased duties on Canadian
  goods to 35% from 25% for all products not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada
  trade agreement, but gave Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs to
  negotiate a broader trade deal. Trump had threatened on Wednesday that
  Ottawa’s move to recognise a Palestinian state would make agreeing a trade
  deal “very hard”. Asian shares fell on Friday after the tariffs announcement.

  president Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing reciprocal
  tariffs ranging from 10% to 41% on imports from dozens of countries and
  foreign locations, as he extended the deadline for a tariff deal with Mexico
  by another 90 days. Rates were set at 25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20%
  for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline to
  strike trade deals with countries around the world by 1 August. Brazil’s
  tariff rate was set at 10%, but a previous order signed by Trump placed a 40%
  tariff on some Brazilian goods, to punish the country for prosecuting its
  former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to overturn an election he lost
  and inspiring his supporters to storm the seat of government. Separately, the
  White House announced that Canadian imports will face tariffs of 35%, not the
  current 25%. Trump had threatened on Wednesday that Ottawa’s move to recognise
  a Palestinian state would make agreeing a trade deal “very hard”. Read the

  35% Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday increasing tariffs on
  Canadian goods imported to the United States from 25% to 35%. The new import
  tax rates goes into effect on Friday, according to a White House factsheet.
  The tariff would cover all products not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade
  agreement. Goods transshipped to another country to evade the new tariffs
  would be subject to a transshipment levy of 40%. The decision comes after
  months of tariff threats from the Trump administration, and escalating trade
  tensions that have sowed anger in Canada. Read the full story Trump threatens
  drug giants with crackdown over prices Donald Trump has threatened to use
  “every tool in our arsenal” to crack down on pharmaceutical companies if they
  fail to cut drug prices for Americans within 60 days. The president wrote to
  executives at 17 companies on Thursday, demanding they match their US prices
  for prescription drugs with the lowest price offered in other developed
  nations. Read the full story Executive order brings back presidential fitness

  back the presidential fitness test, a series of physical tests for
  schoolchildren in the US that was in place for decades but suspended 12 years
  ago to focus less on competition and more on healthy lifestyles. Read the full
  story Hegseth aides used polygraphs against colleagues Senior aides to the
  defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, conducted polygraphs on their own colleagues

  people familiar with the matter. Read the full story Fema denies grants to

  90,000 sq ft and will hold up to 650 seats. It will be the latest change
  introduced to what’s known as “the People’s House” since the Republican
  president returned to office in January. It also will be the first structural

  Greene that “what is occurring [in Gaza] is a genocide”. Trump replied: “Oh

  Gaza, and his false claim that the recent donation of $30m was $60m. Reuters

  university it has referred been referred to the Department of Justice, to
