  A former vicar who led an evangelical movement between 1986 and 1995 has been
  found guilty of 17 counts of indecent assault against nine women. Chris Brain,
  68, appeared at Inner London crown court accused of sexual offences against 13
  women who were members of the Nine O’Clock Service (NOS), an influential
  Sheffield-based Christian worship group that was likened to a cult. He was
  found guilty on Wednesday of 17 counts of indecent assault during the years he
  led the movement. The jury cleared him of 15 counts of indecent assault but
  were still deliberating on four counts of indecent assault and one count of
  rape. Prosecutors previously told jurors that the NOS was aimed at younger
  people and “presented itself to the outside world as a progressive force for
  good”. They said the NOS became a cult in which Brain abused his position to
  exert control over the lives of his female followers and ostracised them from
  friends and family. The court heard that a “homebase team” was set up to “care
  for” Brain – referred to as the Lycra lovelies or the Lycra nuns – and
  witnesses reported seeing the defendant surrounded by attractive women in
  lingerie at his home, looking after his needs. Prosecuting, Tim Clark KC
  relayed accounts to the court from complainants who said Brain groomed them
  and would touch them during massages. Brain denies all the charges against
  him. Jurors will return to court at 10am on Thursday to continue deliberations
  on the remaining charges.
