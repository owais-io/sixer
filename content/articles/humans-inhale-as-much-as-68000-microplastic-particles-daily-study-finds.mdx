  Every breath people take in their homes or car probably contains significant
  amounts of microplastics small enough to burrow deep into lungs, new
  peer-reviewed research finds, bringing into focus a little understood route of
  exposure and health threat. The study, published in the journal Plos One,
  estimates humans can inhale as much as 68,000 tiny plastic particles daily.
  Previous studies have identified larger pieces of airborne microplastics, but
  those are not as much of a health threat because they do not hang in the air
  as long, or move as deep into the pulmonary system. The smaller bits measure
  between 1 and 10 micrometers, or about one-seventh the thickness of a human
  hair, and present more of a health threat because they can more easily be
  distributed throughout the body. The findings “suggest that the health impacts
  of microplastic inhalation may be more substantial than we realize”, the
  authors wrote. “We were quite surprised about the microplastic levels we found
  – it was much higher than previously estimated,” said Nadiia Yakovenko, a
  microplastics researcher and study co-author with France’s University of
  Toulouse. “The size of the particle is small and well-known to transfer into
  tissue, which is dangerous because it can enter into the bloodstream and go
  deep into the respiratory system.” Microplastics are tiny bits of plastic
  either intentionally added to consumer goods, or which are products of larger
  plastics breaking down. The particles contain any number of 16,000 plastic
  chemicals, of which many, such as BPA, phthalates and Pfas, present serious
  health risks. The substance has been found throughout the human body, and can
  cross the placental and brain barriers. Food and water have been thought to be
  the main exposure route, but the new research highlights the risks in air
  pollution. Among other issues, microplastics are linked to chronic pulmonary
  inflammation, which can lead to lung cancer. The concentrations in indoor air
  are far higher than outdoor air, which the study’s authors say is worrying
  because humans spend about 90% of the day indoors. Yakovenko said the
  concentrations indoors are higher because it is an enclosed environment with
  high levels of plastic in a small area, and there is generally poor
  ventilation. The study measured air in multiple rooms throughout several
  apartments, as well as car cabins as the authors drove. The source of the
  microplastics in the apartments is thought to be degrading plastic in consumer
  products, from clothing to kitchen goods to carpets. Virtually any human
  activity will kick up the microplastics because the bits are so light. The
  levels were much higher in an apartment in which two people lived because of
  virtually any human activity that kicks up the particles. Smaller particles
  stay suspended in the air longer because they are lighter, Yakovenko said.
  “Any movement of air, vibrations, your movement, if you walk, sit down, stand
  up, if you open a window – all this is going to resuspend the particles,”
  Yakovenko said. Meanwhile, the concentration of plastic in the cars’ air was
  about four times higher than in the apartments. Because it is a smaller
  enclosed environment, cars have a higher concentration of plastic, and the
  ventilation is not good, Yakovenko said. Researchers matched the microplastic
  material with that used on the dashboard, door handle, steering wheel and
  other components. While it is impossible to avoid all microplastics in the
  air, exposures can be reduced by eliminating as much plastic from the home
  environment as possible – buy products made of wood, metal and natural fibers
  or materials. Hepa air filtration systems have been found to be effective at
  removing microplastics, and Yakovenko said regular vacuuming with a Hepa
  vacuum and dusting can help. Reducing levels in the car is more challenging.
  Opening windows may ventilate a car cabin, but that could potentially allow in
  microplastic pollution from tires.
