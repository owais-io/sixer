  What defines a game by Don’t Nod, the French studio behind acclaimed narrative
  dramas Life Is Strange, Tell Me Why and Lost Records: Bloom and Rage? Dimitri
  Weideli, an executive producer at the company, has a hard time replying to
  this question at first, and then settles on an answer that seems rather broad.
  “We want to make games that matter and that give players a great story that
  allows them to go through different kinds of emotions,” he says. “We try to
  diversify the kind of games we create, but at the same time, keep the same
  spirit.” There’s certainly something to this idea of diversification. Since
  its founding in 2008, the French outfit has made action-adventure games about
  memory, narrative games involving magical college students, and a role-playing
  game about a Georgian vampire. Recently, it released Jusant, an ecological
  sci-fi fable that was also a refreshingly realistic take on rock climbing.
  Aphelion, the team’s latest, does have a little in common with Jusant, at
  least. It is another science-fiction game, but one with a glitteringly hard
  edge. It’s based around a mission to the edge of the solar system where an icy
  world called Persephone has been discovered. Somewhat inevitably, the crew
  crashlands on the planet, and what follows is a journey of exploration,
  survival and stealth in a harsh alien climate. It’s not hard to look at the
  trailer with its grappling hook and walls of climbable ice and view this as a
  spiritual successor to Jusant. This is not the case, according to Weideli. The
  team working on the new game actually came directly from another project, the
  episodic supernatural game, Tell Me Why. The emphasis is different, too.
  Aphelion’s climbing is simpler than Jusant’s, which could get very technical
  in places, and it’s not the central preoccupation this time around. Several
  developers who worked on Jusant have joined the Aphelion team in the last few
  months, however, and have shared their experiences dealing with rope physics
  and vertical level design. The real inspiration for Aphelion largely came from
  movies such as Interstellar, The Martian, Ad Astra and Arrival. “We wanted to
  create a great story-driven game,” says Weideli. “But we wanted to go within
  another genre, that led us to a more action-adventure oriented game.”
  Intriguingly, everywhere you look in Aphelion there’s the presence of real
  science. Persephone itself is based on Planet Nine, a hypothetical large
  planet that many astronomers believe orbits the sun far beyond Neptune where
  it is patiently awaiting discovery. But Planet Nine is only the starting point
  for the fiction here. “Planet Nine was an important source of inspiration,”
  says lead narrative designer Kati Bumbera, “and an interesting scientific
  grounding for an adventure featuring astronauts who explore a new planet.
  [But] we then added our own lore, imagination, and most importantly, human
  drama.” Aphelion is also pitched as a collaboration with the European Space
  Agency. “The ESA team gave us access to space experts and scientists, with
  whom we could discuss and challenge our ideas about the story of the game,”
  Weideli says. “For example, our narrative team could discuss the scientific
  aspects of a space or extraterrestrial mission, review the vocabulary of a
  space mission, how astronauts talk to each other during a mission. They also
  offered to review and give advice regarding the technology.” The design team
  won’t be playing things entirely straight, however. Alongside exploration and
  survival, there’s that final element: Aphelion is also a stealth game. Weideli
  isn’t ready to talk about it yet, but something has survived out in the ice of
  Persephone, and it doesn’t seem entirely friendly. Whatever lurking horrors
  await, it’s nice to see Don’t Nod back making complex, hard-to-classify video
  games, after a recent round of redundancies. With so many people working in
  games at the moment engaged in an awful real-world spin on the survival genre,
  it’s thrilling to see a team still turning to the stars. • Aphelion is
  released next year on PC, PS5 and Xbox • This article was amended on 7 August
  2025 to correct a misspelling of Dimitri Weideli’s first name. Also a quote
  wrongly attributed to Dimitri Weideli was corrected to Kati Bumbera.
