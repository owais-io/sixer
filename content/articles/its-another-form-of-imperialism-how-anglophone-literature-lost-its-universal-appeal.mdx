  When I heard that a major international broadcaster would be producing a TV
  series based on Claudia Durastanti’s Strangers I Know, as a millennial Italian
  writer I was enthusiastic. Durastanti’s book – a fictionalised memoir about
  growing up between rural southern Italy and Brooklyn, and between identities,
  as the hearing daughter of two deaf parents – was the first literary novel of
  an Italian writer from my generation to reach a global public. Published in
  English by Fitzcarraldo Editions in 2022, in a translation by Elizabeth
  Harris, its success was widely seen as a good omen, the sign that
  international publishers were starting to show interest in a new crop of
  Italian literature. A further reason for my enthusiasm was that a big part of
  Strangers I Know takes place in Basilicata, where my father is from. It is one
  of the country’s poorest regions, right at the arch of Italy’s boot, a place
  so derelict and forgotten that the one nationally renowned book about it,
  Carlo Levi’s wartime memoir Christ Stopped at Eboli, owes its title to the
  idea that the saviour, crossing Italy from the north, stopped at a village
  before the region’s border: Basilicata was never saved. Its breathtaking
  limestone canyons and ancient Greek temples notwithstanding, the region offers
  little in terms of recognisable, picturesque Italianness – the Tuscan hills,
  Venetian canals and clothesline-strewn Neapolitan alleys which, I felt,
  Italian novels were often expected to offer if they wanted to appeal to an
  international audience. Strangers I Know seemed poised to broaden the range of
  what we understand as an Italian story – because it was also an American one,
  and because it eschewed all stereotypes about Italy. Not for long. After a
  pilot was written and slated for production, the broadcaster asked for a
  rewrite. The Italian backdrop, they said, was too unfamiliar. Why not set it
  in Ireland? It would be easier for audiences to relate to, and in its crucial
  aspects (Catholic, poor) it was kind of the same. The project was ultimately
  shelved. The history of the novel is deeply entwined with European
  nationalisms and national identities. Walter Scott’s historical novels drew
  from (and consolidated) Scotland’s history into a shared mythology; Alessandro
  Manzoni’s The Betrothed is still studied in Italian schools as the crucible
  that forged a unified language from a plethora of local variants; Goethe,
  Austen, Dostoevsky and Balzac all captured what they felt was the nature of a
  specific place and time, offering nations a mirror in which to see or imagine
  their national ethos. As books were translated and read across borders, a
  slightly paradoxical notion of two-layered reading emerged: novels offered, on
  the one hand, a very precise depiction of a specific place and time and
  national spirit; but through the specifics, something general could be
  glimpsed outside the national confines – about what it feels like to be a
  person, which to me sounds like a serviceable approximation of what the art of
  the novel is about. This gave rise to an idea of literature as a kind of
  exchange or conversation between national literatures, each with their
  allotted seats at the canon – Fernando Pessoa or Robert Musil, Henrik Ibsen or
  Émile Zola: of course, they were almost exclusively male seats. The
  imperialistic premise in this idea of literature as an egalitarian
  conversation between national traditions is blatant: as Milan Kundera
  remarked, what it took for a country to be awarded its own national literature
  – instead of being grouped into an ill-assorted umbrella term such as
  “Mitteleuropa” – was a colonial past. And yet that was still the way
  literature was taught and read, in Italy, until a couple of decades ago. We
  read Gustave Flaubert and Georges Perec. We read Jane Austen and Virginia
  Woolf. We read Thomas Mann and Ernesto Sábato. And then we didn’t. The
  consolidation of the English-language publishing industry in the 1980s and 90s
  gave its most successful writers a worldwide reach and a critical impact that
  no authors from other countries could aspire to. The Italian contemporary
  canon, at the beginning of the millennium, was composed of David Foster
  Wallace and Zadie Smith and Jonathan Franzen; the country’s first creative
  writing programme, established in the mid-90s, owes its name to Holden
  Caulfield; its students (some of whom have been my students) learn technique
  by reading Ernest Hemingway and Joan Didion, who show; not Anna Maria Ortese
  and Elsa Morante, who tell. Their Italian syntax and style – as measured in
  Eleonora Gallitelli’s groundbreaking computational studies – are more
  influenced by English than the Italian of translators working from English.
  This didn’t happen only in Europe. As discussed in Minae Mizumura’s The Fall
  of Language in the Age of English – an essayistic memoir about the author’s
  having to choose between being an American and a Japanese writer, and choosing
  the latter, and regretting it – at the turn of the millennium the idea of
  national literatures, modelled as a system of literary discourses on a
  somewhat equal footing, no longer held. Instead, we moved into a world in
  which one of those traditions had expanded beyond the national, becoming de
  facto universal. There is nothing intrinsically lamentable about this, which
  can be seen as a way out of nationalisms. But there can be only one universal;
  and as the anglophone tradition ascended, other national literatures shrank to
  become increasingly local. In a system in which English-language literature
  deals transnationally with general issues, the specifics that had
  characterised national literatures (Austen’s England, Dostoevsky’s Russia)
  lose their role and become local colour, picturesque. When a story has
  universal ambitions, such as Durastanti’s Strangers I Know, it thus makes
  sense to recast it someplace more relatable, in a setting where the exoticism
  won’t get in the way. Something similar happened to me. Years ago, a German
  publisher declined to translate my second novel – a story of ambition and
  financial speculation – because the Italian backdrop might have confused a
  German readership used to imagining corporate raiders in New York, or perhaps
  in Frankfurt. But, he said, the chapters in which the protagonist visited his
  father in Venice were great, so poetic. Had I considered setting a book in
  Venice? Italy, for him, had ceased to be seen as a legitimate context for
  corporate ambition, as it was in Paolo Volponi’s Le Mosche del Capitale, and
  become a set of exotic backdrops: Naples, Puglia, Rome, the Tuscan hills, or
  Venice. This, in a way, is a division of labour: a way the international
  market for literature has tried to become more efficient by allocating the
  general discourse to a set of mostly English-speaking writers, while a
  peripheral circle of local colleagues are outsourced with producing gondolas,
  popes, crying madonnas, and pizza. But the landscape described by Mizumura has
  drastically rearranged itself over the past few years, and the primacy of
  anglophone literature seems to have faded. The authors in today’s contemporary
  canon – celebrated by critics worldwide, and imitated by aspiring novelists –
  come from much more varied backgrounds and write in many more languages.
  Roberto Bolaño, Annie Ernaux, Han Kang and Karl Ove Knausgård are the Franzens
  and Wallaces of two decades ago. Of course it is impossible to draw a precise
  line for a general shift of this kind, but “Ferrante fever” could be as good a
  watershed moment as any. Elena Ferrante was a relatively niche writer (both in
  her country and abroad) whose novels achieved a spectacular, worldwide
  success, reaching the kind of ubiquity previously associated with people
  performatively reading Infinite Jest to show off. It also sparked a growing
  international interest in Italian literature, involving both younger writers
  (such as Durastanti, or myself for that matter) or allegedly “forgotten”
  classics, such as the works of Elsa Morante and Alba de Céspedes. There could
  be several reasons for this. The further consolidation of the US publishing
  industry has made it harder for innovative, ambitious novels to emerge. It
  could be an effect of the trendiness of “literature in translation” in the
  English-language market – even though the notion that it would have its own
  niche is largely unfathomable to non-native English speakers, used since
  childhood to reading literature in translation and calling it “literature”. It
  could also be that different books are being written. Since the turn of the
  century, writers from all over the world have felt the dual literary
  citizenship that Minae wrote about: seeing themselves as part of both a local
  and a universal tradition, reading Anna Maria Ortese at the Scuola Holden. It
  would have been natural to try to combine the two, working into their writing
  a thin veneer of exoticism to lead readers to engage with its deeper ideas. Of
  course there is much, much more to, say, Ferrante’s novels than a picturesque
  Italian backdrop. But the backdrop’s recognisability – indeed, its very
  picturesqueness – has probably played a role in making them relatable to a
  wider audience. Bolaño’s The Savage Detectives similarly toys with cliches
  about Mexico, both subverting them and contextualising them into a wider
  picture. Han Kang’s The Vegetarian plays into a strain of body horror that
  western readers have come to stereotypically associate with east Asian
  literature – only to explode it with a psychologically harrowing and
  politically powerful fable about resisting patriarchy. On the other hand, this
  increased international interest in non-anglophone literature could have
  another source: no matter where these books originated, their worldwide
  success often came as a result of their success in English. This was the case
  with, for instance, both Ferrante and Bolaño, who only caught on abroad after
  resonating with the English‑language market. It is particularly evident in
  Han’s case: The Vegetarian was published in South Korea in 2007, but gained
  international acclaim after Deborah Smith’s spectacularly successful
  translation was published almost a decade later. In a particularly significant
  twist, its Italian edition was translated from the English instead of Han’s
  Korean, not because no translators could be found but because the editor, who
  read it in English, found Smith’s prose more effective – more relatable? –
  than the renditions they initially commissioned from the original. This is not
  limited to recent, successful novels: two canonical 20th-century Italian
  authors, Natalia Ginzburg and Alba de Céspedes, have been translated
  internationally mostly after their English editions. Conversely, classic
  Danish author Tove Ditlevsen’s trilogy appeared in Italian after its US
  translation. If anglophone culture no longer beams its literature from the
  centre to what Umberto Eco called “the peripheries of the Empire”, it still
  acts as a transit hub between them, the arbiter of what is allowed to go
  beyond the confines of the local. My own novel, Perfection, has been acquired
  for translation in languages from Thai to Lithuanian only after its reception
  in English, and its International Booker shortlisting. This could be seen as
  another, subtler form of imperialism; and yet it also allows more room for
  agency. Our peripheries are closer to each other than the long way through the
  centre makes it seem: readers in Buenos Aires or Naples could very well find a
  story set in Seoul more relatable than one set in Franzen’s Minnesota.
  Durastanti’s latest novel, Missitalia, has a section set in Basilicata, mixing
  the true story of the women-only gangs that haunted its forests in the 19th
  century with the parallel-history discovery of oil there. As it is currently
  being translated into 10 languages (including English), she recently told me
  that her translators sometimes reach out to ask for help in rendering the
  region’s atmosphere. “Just think Appalachia,” is an answer she gives. •
  Perfection by Vincenzo Latronico, translated by Sophie Hughes, is published by
  Fitzcarraldo (£12.99). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy
