  Going out: Cinema Unmoored Out now The debut feature from Caroline Ingvarsson,
  this adaptation of the 2015 novel The Living and the Dead in Winsford by Håkan
  Nesser demonstrates that cinema still has an appetite for Nordic noir,
  although this time the psychological suspense unfolds not only in Sweden but
  also the wilds of Exmoor in the UK. Materialists Out now Those who loved
  Celine Song’s wistful, romantic Past Lives have been waiting eagerly for her
  follow-up, and here it is. Starring Chris Evans, Dakota Johnson and man of the
  moment Pedro Pascal, it follows a trio of New Yorkers caught in a love
  triangle. Together Out now Following a buzzy premiere at Sundance, this body
  horror sees a school teacher and a would-be musician (played by real life
  couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie) move to a remote rural area, where a very
  literal form of togetherness awaits them. Aaaaaaaah! BFI Southbank, London, 20
  August Steve Oram’s Aaaaaaaah! is one of the great cult films of the 21st
  century, and to celebrate its 10th anniversary, it’s screening at the BFI,
  with a cast and crew Q&amp;A. Filmed in an ape language without captions, the
  cast, including Julian Barratt, Julian Rhind-Tutt and Toyah Willcox, give it
  their all to create a work of bizarre, low-budget brilliance. Catherine Bray
  *** Going out: Gigs Big Feastival 22 to 24 August, Kingham, nr Chipping Norton
  Occasional Blur bassist Alex James opens the gates of his farm again for more
  music and Michelin-starred chefs. Doing the singing while others scoff their
  street food will be the likes of Nelly Furtado, Mabel and Travis, while
  James’s old pal Graham Coxon will also be there with his project the Waeve.
  Michael Cragg Enhypen The O2, London, 22 August; AO Arena, Manchester, 25
  August The seven-man K-pop juggernaut arrive in the UK as part of their
  year-long world tour in support of last year’s Romance: Untold album (the
  best-selling K-pop of 2024, fact fans). Expect songs from that, alongside this
  year’s slinky English-language single, Loose. MC Chris Montague/Ant Law
  Quartet Vortex Jazz Club, London, 22 August In the 2020s, two formidable young
  jazz guitarists separately surfaced on the UK scene: Chris Montague in pianist
  Kit Downes’s powerful Troyka trio, and Ant Law as an innovator of contemporary
  guitar-led fusion. Their combined resources meet on this quartet gig with
  bassist Conor Chaplin and Jazz Warriors drums legend Mark Mondesir. John
  Fordham Suor Angelica Usher Hall, Edinburgh, 16 August; Royal Albert Hall,
  London, 19 August Antonio Pappano conducts the LSO in concert performances of
  Puccini’s one-act tearjerker, with Carolina López Moreno in the title role. In
  Edinburgh he precedes it with more Puccini, the Capriccio Sinfonico, and
  Victor de Sabata’s tone poem Juventus; while at the Albert Hall it’s paired
  with the “symphonic fantasy” from Richard Strauss’s opera Die Frau ohne
  Schatten. Andrew Clements *** Going out: Art Aubrey Levinthal Ingleby Gallery,
  Edinburgh, to 13 September Paintings of everyday life in contemporary
  Philadelphia by an American artist getting her first significant British
  exhibition. Levinthal is an introspective, low-key artist who sees the world
  in misted, ambiguous colours. She likes to look over rooftops, at flowers, or
  friends in the street. Goes well with festival hangovers. Andy Warhol Lightbox
  Gallery, Woking, to 2 November Was Warhol the prophet or a symptom of US
  cultural and political decline? It’s hard not to wonder with Trump taking the
  nation to new lows. Warhol saw everything coming: cheap celebrity, media
  shallowness, junk food. But he also saw the soul inside the machine. He shows
  us America, darkly. Makers of Modern Gothic V&amp;A South Kensington, London,
  to 26 October Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin was one of Britain’s great
  idiosyncratic visionaries. This Victorian architect and designer wanted to
  literally resurrect the middle ages. Pugin’s obsessive study and reinvention
  of the gothic style can be seen up close in this free display of his drawings,
  which also looks at his collaborators. Francesca Woodman Tate Modern, London,
  ongoing This display from the Artist Rooms collection takes you into the eerie
  world of photographer Francesca Woodman. In her sensual, mysterious
  black-and-white photographs staged in run-down buildings in Providence, Rhode
  Island as well as Venice and Rome, Woodman explores her haunted moods and
  fantasies. An elusive genius. Jonathan Jones *** Going out: Stage Breaking
  Bach Usher Hall, Edinburgh, 20 August Bach meets hip-hop in this premiere from
  choreographer Kim Brandstrup and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.
  Bach’s music, including the Double Violin Concerto and third Brandenburg
  Concerto, is brought to life by professional dancers and the raw talent of
  students from Acland Burghley School in London. Lyndsey Winship Adam Kay 19
  August to 2 October; tour starts Peebles First, a tour in support of his
  murder mystery novel A Particularly Nasty Case, then doctor turned comedian
  Kay takes his hit 2023 standup show Undoctored on a nationwide jaunt (27
  September to 13 February). This Is Going to Hurt fans will know what to
  expect: gallows humour and medical anecdotes not for the faint-hearted. Rachel
  Aroesti Alice in Wonderland Kew Gardens, London, to 31 August The Australian
  Shakespeare Company return to Kew Gardens with a trio of shows – including an
  interactive and family-friendly take on Lewis Carroll’s deliciously absurd
  adventure. Dressing up is actively encouraged (for ages 5+). Miriam Gillinson
  Hedda Gabler Ustinov Studio, Theatre Royal Bath, to 23 August Your last chance
  to catch Lily Allen in the title role of Ibsen’s fiercely intense classic.
  Suffocated by her life, can Hedda find a release? Directed by Matthew Dunster
  and with cast including Imogen Stubbs and Brendan Coyle. MG *** Staying in:
  Streaming Hostage Netflix, 21 August A Netflix nailbiter of a slightly higher
  order courtesy of Oscar-nominated screenwriter Matt Charman. Under the shadow
  of a spate of deadly Channel crossings, an immigration summit between the
  British prime minister (Suranne Jones) and the French president (Julie Delpy)
  is interrupted when the former’s husband is abducted by bereaved refugees.
  Confessions of a Brain Surgeon BBC Two &amp; iPlayer, 18 August, 9pm In the
  minds of many – including his own – Henry Marsh was once a superhero: a
  trailblazing neurosurgeon who pioneered the practice of operating while the
  patient was conscious. Now retired and dealing with cancer, the 75-year-old
  looks back on his career as he is confronted by parents who blame him for the
  death of their son. Murder Case: The Vanishing Cyclist BBC Two &amp; iPlayer,
  17 August, 9pm This Scottish true-crime series returns to untangle the tragic
  fate of 63-year-old grandfather Tony Parsons, who went missing during a
  charity bike ride through the Highlands. His whereabouts remained a mystery
  until a local man decided to confess his guilt to a new girlfriend. Mudtown
  U&amp;Alibi, 20 August, 9pm Filmed back to back in Welsh and English – the
  former version aired on S4C late last year – this Newport-set drama follows
  Claire (Gotham’s Erin Richards), a magistrate whose professional duties begin
  conflicting with her maternal instincts when her teenage daughter falls in
  with a criminal crowd. The Gold’s Tom Cullen co-stars. RA *** Staying in:
  Games Sword of the Sea Out 19 August; PC, PS5 Explore a desolate world on a
  hoverboard, pulling tricks while bringing back life to the beautifully drawn
  landscapes. The latest from Giant Squid, creator of the award-winning
  exploration game Abzû, promises a cross between 1080° Snowboarding and the
  seminal PlayStation title Journey. Discounty Out 21 August; PC, PS5, Xbox
  Series X/S, Switch This cosy life sim has you running a supermarket in the
  faded seaside town of Blomkest, managing your inventory as well as testy
  relationships with the gossiping locals. The visuals are cute and the story
  will keep you intrigued as you stack those shelves. Keith Stuart *** Staying
  in: Albums Alison Goldfrapp – Flux Out now Partly created in Sweden, pop maven
  Alison Goldfrapp’s second solo album, the follow-up to 2023’s clubbier The
  Love Invention, reflects the wonders of its birthplace. Songs such as the
  tactile Strange Things Happen and the laser-guided Sound &amp; Light feel ripe
  for soundtracking the northern lights, for example. Conan Gray – Wishbone Out
  now Initially created in secret while Gray was touring 2024’s Found Heaven,
  Wishbone eschews that record’s 80s-tinged power pop in favour of something
  quieter. Produced by Dan Nigro (Lorde, Chappell Roan), love lost single Vodka
  Cranberry gently flutters around a folksy musical backbone. Rise Against –
  Ricochet Out now Ten albums in, the Chicago punk band haven’t lost any of
  their power. Ricochet finds the quartet exploring ideas around
  interconnectedness, with muscular lead single Nod looking at where shared
  anger needs to be placed, while Prizefighter dissects the band’s relationship
  with their fanbase. Billianne – Modes of Transportation Out now After going
  viral in 2021 with her cover of Tina Turner’s The Best, Canadian
  singer-songwriter Billianne releases her debut album. On the galloping
  soft-pop of Baby Blue she gives 1989-era Taylor Swift a run for her money,
  while the cute Crush is a romcom theme song in waiting. MC *** Staying in:
  Brain food The C-Word Podcast Lena Dunham and writer Alissa Bennett’s incisive
  series about the misunderstood women of history has recently been taken from
  behind its paywall. Highlights include a deep dive into the life and career of
  Amy Winehouse. Close Reading Poetry YouTube Harvard academic Dr Adam Walker’s
  YouTube channel not only analyses work by western canonical poets but also
  delivers engaging insights into the poeticism of authors such as Tolkien plus
  country music songwriters. Rare Earth Radio 4, 22 August, 12.04pm In a world
  increasingly struck by fires, floods and other consequences of the climate
  crisis, what role does insurance play? That is the question posed in this
  fascinating six-part series, opening with the 2024 LA wildfires. Ammar Kalia
