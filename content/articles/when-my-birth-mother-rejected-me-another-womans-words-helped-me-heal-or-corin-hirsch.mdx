  Sometimes we learn the deepest truths in the most quotidian moments. One
  afternoon when I was six, I watched a character give birth in an army tent in
  the sitcom M*A*S*H. I immediately rushed from the den into the kitchen with a
  very important question for my mother. “Did you give birth to me in a tent
  like that?” I blurted out, hoping to learn my origin story. Unexpectedly, my
  mother dashed from the room in tears. When she returned, she sat me down and
  broke the news I had somehow always known. “Your Uncle Ana brought you home
  from the hospital to Mommy and Daddy,” she said. “You’re adopted, which means
  we chose you.” I felt relieved to learn this truth, but as it upset my mom, I
  resolved never to bring it up again. Still, my thirst for details never waned.
  My parents and I had the same skin tone, but I didn’t much look like them. I
  was awkward, gangly and bookish; they were not. Despite their love and
  acceptance, I had always felt like an alien in my family and could never put
  my finger on why. In the decades before Google, I was ill-equipped to track
  down information about my biological parents, especially because I was a minor
  and adoption records were then sealed in every US state. Shortly after I
  turned 18, though, I called the hospital where I was born to ask for my
  records. The clerk, initially warm, seemed puzzled that I didn’t know my last
  name at birth. After I admitted that I was adopted, a chill fell across the
  line. My records arrived in the mail a few weeks later, crisscrossed with
  thick black marker. The clerk had blocked out every trace of personal
  information: my birth mother’s name, birth date, address and details about her
  hospital stay. The redacted records reinforced a sense of erasure. I stuffed
  them away, and tried to move on. Years later, as a journalist adept at digging
  up information about practically anyone and anything, I continued to hit dead
  ends when it came to learning more about my biological mother. Then, when I
  was 35, I used part of a tax refund to hire a private investigator to try to
  find her contact details. He tracked her down quickly: she was a marine
  attorney living in Connecticut. Elated and fantasising about a joyful
  mother-daughter reunion, I quickly fired off a letter, gently suggesting she
  was my mother and asking for medical history and ethnicity details. My dream
  turned out to be just that: a fantasy. My birth mother replied, but not in the
  way I had hoped. In attorney-like fashion, she’d neither confirm nor deny I
  was the baby she had given up on that late July day, but implied it with her
  words. “I don’t want to think back on that experience,” she wrote, adding that
  information about my existence could be “greatly damaging” to her. Her email
  left me shaken. Surely she’d want to see the person I had become? I summoned
  the courage to request a photo and perhaps even lunch (we lived about three
  hours apart). But she insisted that I never contact her again. I didn’t know
  it at the time, but secondary rejection by a birth parent – when an attempt at
  reconnection with a birth family fails – is rare and considered a traumatic
  event, for which some adoptees seek therapeutic support. I dealt with the
  initial blow with long phone calls to friends and probably a little too much
  red wine. I didn’t have much time to ruminate, though – I was working towards
  a master’s degree and later that week headed off to a seminar with my
  professor at her New York City apartment. During an afternoon tea break, my
  professor’s partner, a judge, chatted with us at the counter of their cosy
  kitchen. With a brusque, direct communication style honed in New York City
  courtrooms, she asked about my life. I blurted out the events of the past few
  days and told her how I was finding it nearly impossible to focus. She
  listened intently. Then, as I imagined she might do in court, she began
  rapid-fire questioning. “When were you born?” she asked. The early 1970s, I
  told her. “And your mother, was she Catholic?” “Yes,” I replied, “from an
  Irish Catholic family. One of seven, I think.” “And she was young, probably?”
  “Yeah – 19, I think.” She paused. “You know, I’m just about the same age as
  your birth mother,” she said. “It might be hard for you to understand,
  especially now, but back then it was tough for an Irish-Catholic girl who
  became pregnant outside marriage.” I almost choked on my tea. Was she really
  defending my biological mother? My birth mother who was rejecting me again out
  of shame, cruelty or both? “I didn’t know that,” I admitted. “But it doesn’t
  excuse her actions. She’s in her 50s, for goodness sake.” Undeterred, the
  judge explained how pregnant Catholic girls were often sent away to conceal
  their pregnancies and save face for their families. How the stigma could be
  overwhelming. She reminded me that abortion was illegal at the time, and Roe v
  Wade (the decision that legalised abortion in the US) was still a few months
  off. As we placed our mugs in the sink, she urged me to try to see the
  situation through another lens, if only for my own peace of mind. “What’s done
  is done,” she said. “You are alive, and you have the rest of your life ahead
  of you.” Now that I knew the truth, the only way forward was through. For
  weeks, I clung to my sense of injustice. Perhaps I had grown attached to the
  bewildering primal wound I’d carted around since childhood. Like many
  adoptees, I had long been unable to explain why I felt displaced. Now, I had
  proof. But if trauma and shame are generational continuums, how do we break
  the cycle? Over the ensuing months and years, I realised the judge had thrown
  me a lifeline of sorts. What she said that afternoon had planted seeds of
  compassion for a woman I could have easily grown to resent. It had blunted the
  edges of what might have festered into lifelong bitterness, and it fuelled an
  enduring empathy I’ve applied in many situations since. Her words also became
  a salve when I was rejected again by a biological uncle, after we were
  connected by a DNA test. And they were a shot of confidence when I sought and
  eventually found my biological father’s family – all of whom welcomed me with
  open arms and not an ounce of hesitation. Above all, the judge’s words in the
  kitchen that long-ago day allowed me to let go of the need for perfect answers
  – and make space for imperfect endings. Corin Hirsch is a writer who covers
