  “Where shall we go on holiday?” would not, ideally, be a stressful question.
  But the world in 2025 is far from ideal, and summer breaks in Europe and North
  America are no exception. Holiday hotspots are being ravaged by heat, fire,
  floods and drought as fossil fuel pollution warps the climate – and travelling
  to reach them in planes or on cruise ships spews far more planet-heating gas
  than anything else you and I are likely to do. (Rocket enthusiasts such as
  Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos, I assume, have not yet subscribed to Down to
  Earth.) It’s hard to relax by the beach in 40C heat with the stench of smoke
  fouling the air. For some travellers, a nagging sense of guilt will further
  sully what they hoped would be a break of mindless bliss. ‘We have already
  entered the beginning of the age of non-tourism’ It was a dizzying array of
  dream destinations. Smooth-talking salespeople at the world’s largest tourism
  trade fair stood ready to whisk you out of a dreary German conference hall and
  take you to far-flung lands that seemed too perfect to be real. High
  mountains, white beaches, jaw-dropping deserts – the options were endless, and
  all too available. I had gone to the ITB Berlin to hear how the holiday
  industry was feeling about its future and the answer, for the most part, was
  unflinchingly cheery. The Swedish concept of flygskam, or flight shame, has
  failed to gain traction beyond a small share of climate-concerned tourists.
  Covid lockdowns brought only temporary pain to the aviation sector, which was
  bailed out with vast sums of public money when its planes were grounded.
  Traveller numbers in 2024 had returned to pre-pandemic highs. It had been a
  bad few years, everyone agreed, but things were finally looking up. One talk,
  however, struck a noticeably different tone. In a speech that the conference
  organisers billed as a “must-hear session for anyone who cares about the
  future of travel and our planet”, Stefan Gössling, one of the most-cited
  travel researchers in the world, calmly declared the approaching demise of the
  era of mass tourism. “We have already entered the beginning of the age of
  non-tourism,” said Gössling, a business professor at Linnaeus University who
  has consulted for the UN and World Bank, to an uneasy audience of travel
  agencies, car rental companies, cruise operators and hoteliers. Gössling
  argues that worsening weather is raising the cost of travel to levels that
  consumers’ wallets will soon be unable to sustain. It’s not just the odd
  heatwave here or wildfire there, he said, when I spoke with him after the
  talk, but the mounting cost of everything from food to insurance that will
  render travel as we know it unaffordable. It’s a big claim. The rising costs
  of extreme weather would have to outpace expected growth in global incomes by
  a large margin for his thesis to hold. That seems plausible if global heating
  reaches civilisation-threatening temperature levels that are 4C or 5C above
  the preindustrial average – in which case prepper bunkers will hold more
  appeal to me than all-inclusive resorts – but I find it hard to imagine at
  1.5C or 2C, the levels to which world leaders have promised to reach. And yet.
  Europe experienced its worst wildfires on record this summer, on the back of a
  year in which political enthusiasm for climate action has plunged. Even
  “coolcation” destinations – popularised to beat the heat – such as Norway and
  Canada have been hit by staggering temperature extremes in recent weeks. Nor
  is it just the worsening weather that puts tourism at risk. Flying is one of
  the hardest activities to clean up with technological solutions and efforts to
  keep disasters from spiralling will add to that cost. The price of a plane
  ticket is likely to balloon if it includes the cost of making planes greener
  or sucking carbon pollution back out of the atmosphere. That doesn’t paint a
  pretty picture for tourism industry executives. In blunt terms, they can
  either go green and raise prices or let the planet burn and raise prices.
  Either way, it may be time for the long-overlooked domestic holiday – cheap,
  convenient and often more relaxing – to finally make a comeback. Read more:
