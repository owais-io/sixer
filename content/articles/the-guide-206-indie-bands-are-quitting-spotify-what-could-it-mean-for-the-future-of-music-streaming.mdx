  At the moment, the Spotify exodus of 2025 is a trickle rather than a flood. A
  noticeable trickle, like a leak from the upstairs bathroom dribbling down the
  living room wall, but nothing existential yet. The five notable bands who have
  left Spotify in the past month – shoegazers Hotline TNT last week, joining
  Deerhoof, Xiu Xiu, Godspeed You! Black Emperor (GY!BE) and King Gizzard and
  the Lizard Wizard – are well liked in indie circles, but aren’t the sorts to
  rack up billions of listens. Still, it feels significant if only because,
  well, this sort of thing wasn’t really supposed to happen any more. Plenty of
  bands and artists refused to play ball with Spotify in its early years, when
  the streamer still had work to do before achieving total ubiquity. But at some
  point there seemed to a collective recognition that resistance was futile,
  that Spotify had won and those bands would have to bend to its
  less-than-appealing model. That realisation was best summed up by the Black
  Keys, a legitimately big rock band at the time of Spotify’s emergence who
  refused to put the albums they released around then – 2011’s El Camino and
  2014’s Turn Blue – on the platform. They relented two years later and say now
  that “taking a stand definitely hurt us in the long run”. This artist
  acquiescence happened in tandem – surely not coincidentally – with a closer
  relationship between Spotify and the record labels that once viewed it as
  their destroyer. Some of the bigger labels have found a way to make a lot of
  money from streaming: Spotify paid out $10bn in royalties last year – though
  many artists would point out that only a small fraction of that reaches them
  after their label takes its share. Despite those conditions, for artists
  dealing with Spotify, it has long seemed unavoidable. So why have those five
  bands departed in quick succession? The trigger was the announcement that
  Spotify founder Daniel Ek had led a €6oom fundraising push into a German
  defence company specialising in AI weapons technology. That was enough to
  prompt Deerhoof, the veteran San Francisco oddball noise pop band, to jump.
  “We don’t want our music killing people,” was how they bluntly explained their
  move on Instagram. That seems to have also been the animating factor for the
  rest of the departed, though GY!BE, who aren’t on any social media platforms,
  removed their music from Spotify – and indeed all other platforms aside from
  Bandcamp – without issuing a statement, while Hotline TNT’s statement seemed
  to frame it as one big element in a broader ideological schism. “The company
  that bills itself as the steward of all recorded music has proven beyond the
  shadow of a doubt that it does not align with the band’s values in any way,”
  the statement read. That speaks to a wider artist discontent in a company that
  has, even by its own standards, had a controversial couple of years. There was
  of course the publication of Liz Pelly’s marmalade-dropper of a book Mood
  Machine, with its blow-by-blow explanation of why Spotify’s model is so
  deleterious to musicians, including allegations that the streamer is filling
  its playlists with “ghost artists” to further push down the number of streams,
  and thus royalty payments, to real artists (Spotify denies this). The streamer
  continues to amend its model in ways that have caused frustration –
  demonetising artists with fewer than 1,000 streams, or by introducing a new
  bundling strategy resulting in lower royalty fees. Meanwhile, the company –
  along with other streamers – has struggled to police a steady flow of
  AI-generated tracks and artists on to the platform. So it’s understandable
  that some bands might have decided that the trade-off is no longer worth it.
  Of course, it should be noted that the five bands mentioned feel they are
  established enough to weather a departure from Spotify, and have the backing
  from their labels to leave. Not everyone will be in the same position. And
  removing yourself from such an important platform is highly risky. But if they
  can pull it off, the sacrifice might just be worth it. “A cooler world is
  possible,” as Hotline TNT put it in their statement. If that’s true for
  artists it’s surely true for listeners too – though I have to say I find it
  really hard to shake the idea of Spotify as anything other than the default
  mode of listening to music, having been using it since 2009. It remains a
  remarkable site of discovery and I’ve encountered bands and genres, across
  decades and continents, that I probably wouldn’t have found without it. But
  while it’s broadened my music consumption, it’s also unquestionably flattened
  it and I don’t give new albums and tracks as many listens as I should. Saying
  that, this year I’ve definitely found myself spending less and less time on
  Spotify. I don’t think that’s down to ethics, necessarily, it just doesn’t
  seem as enticing a prospect as it once did, with the endless lovebombing of
  artificially generated playlists and moods. I’ve been using Bandcamp more,
  even – gasp – buying albums (though equally a lot of the time I previously
  spent listening to music is now being taken up by podcasts instead). Other
  options are, of course, available – the Guardian has provided a helpful guide
  – but they have their own ethical quagmires attached. And ultimately, they are
  replicating the same broad but shallow model as Spotify (with the exception of
  Bandcamp, of course). Maybe weaning ourselves off not just Spotify, but the
  way that Spotify has convinced us to consume music is the only answer. Then a
  cooler world might be possible. If you want to read the complete version of
