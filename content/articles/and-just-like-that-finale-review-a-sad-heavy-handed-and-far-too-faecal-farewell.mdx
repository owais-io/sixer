  farewell

  And just like that: it’s over. A mere two weeks ago, it was announced that the
  Sex and the City spin-off was ending imminently, with showrunner Michael
  Patrick King having decided season three was “a wonderful place to stop”. It
  felt more than a little abrupt, leading to tabloid rumours that HBO was
  pulling the plug on the much-maligned series. An Instagram post from Jonathan
  Cake, who played Carrie’s (Sarah Jessica Parker) latest love interest was
  jokey, but – equally – didn’t read like the words of someone who knew he had
  signed up for a bit part (“Wait, did I JUST KILL [the series]? Duncan finally
  has one night of passion with Carrie Bradshaw and the shows [sic] over …
  FOREVER???”) In any case, the fact that anyone cared at all showed that we had
  come a long way. Back in 2021, this Samantha-free reboot was sternly judged,
  with critics using words like “cringey” and “cloying”. Efforts to diversify
  the cast felt cynical, while Carrie’s pivot to podcasting and Miranda’s foray
  into queer romance with non-binary comic Che Diaz led to scenes that made even
  those two mortifying SATC films seem bearable by comparison. But somewhere
  along the way, And Just Like That got good. Not Sex and the City good, to be
  clear. But it became the sort of warm, absurd escapism that slipped down like
  a classic Cosmopolitan. Nowhere was this more apparent than when Charlotte
  (Kristin Davis) braved a fierce snowstorm to buy condoms for her teenage
  daughter; when Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) deflowered a Wicked-obsessed nun played
  by Rosie O’Donnell; or when the writers accidentally killed off the father of
  fabulous side character Lisa not once but twice. Straight-shooting real-estate
  broker Seema (Sarita Choudhury) proved a solid stand-in for Samantha, and then
  some – which was lucky, because the closest we got to Kim Cattrall was an
  awkward one-minute cameo. By the time we reached the second half of season
  three, the show had found its stride – even if a post-Big, post-Aidan Carrie
  was consumed with writing her turgid historical novel about a lonesome woman
  who definitely isn’t just a stand-in for her. And then, alas, came the news
  that it was almost over. Some viewers may have arrived at this point with a
  sense of relief, but for many there will definitely have been disappointment.
  Why give us this ludicrous curate’s egg, only to snatch it away? And how, dear
  God, do you wrap it all up? Luckily, all TV writers know that setting an
  episode at Thanksgiving means teary resolutions in the company of friends and
  family. Sadly, this is the And Just Like That writers we’re talking about, so
  that didn’t happen. Carrie spent the holiday chez Miranda, who was navigating
  the news that she was to become a grandmother with the same shrill hysteria
  and general alarm that Nixon has long brought to the AJLT universe. Miranda
  then legged it to hang out with her uptight British girlfriend, Joy (Dolly
  Wells), whose dog Sappho was undergoing emergency surgery (noooo!), leaving
  Carrie to play host to bland gallery boss, Mark, as well as Brady’s
  lactose-intolerant baby mama, Mia, and her corral of obnoxious gen Z pals (as
  ever, the episode delighted in caricature). The crescendo of the evening
  involved a toilet overflowing with lots and lots of poo. Could this have
  really been the intended finale to the entire franchise? And yet, well … it
  was sort of perfect, a fitting fever dream of an ending where this most lovely
  of holidays and a chance for human connection ends with a vile plumbing
  disaster. Elsewhere, the plot about our heroine and “the woman” from the novel
  concluded. Carrie began the episode at a Chinese restaurant where a
  well-meaning waiter plopped a stuffed toy in the booth opposite her as a lunch
  companion, sending her into a tailspin. Speaking of unsubtle: Seema, Lisa,
  Charlotte and Carrie then spend an afternoon at a bridal fashion show,
  nattering about relationships. Lisa and Charlotte’s view was more or less that
  marriage was hell on earth but that they’d do it all again anyway, while
  Carrie was more hesitant: “I have to quit thinking, ‘maybe a man’, and start
  accepting: ‘maybe just me’.” She would later pull a French exit from Miranda’s
  faecally charged party to strut around her apartment in heels one last time,
  serenading herself to a karaoke version of Barry White’s You’re The First, The
  Last, My Everything. It was a clear callback to the final moments of Sex and
  the City, when – over a remix of Candi Staton’s You Got the Love – Carrie
  declared that “the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of
  all is the one you have with yourself”. Except that she ended that line with,
  “ … and if you find someone to love the you that you love, well, that’s just
  fabulous”. Here, there was no such coda, as she finished her novel with the
  words: “The woman realises she was not alone – she was on her own.” It was
  emotional, but let’s just say it wasn’t exactly convincing based on previous
  evidence. And so, the weirdest reboot of them all ended with a whimper, as
  though the anaesthetic was finally wearing off and we were all collectively
  coming to. Really, it deserved something bigger, sillier and camper, instead
  of this sad, heavy-handed farewell. Still, at least they didn’t bring Che back
  to pay their respects. • And Just Like That is on Now TV in the UK, HBO Max in
  the US and Binge in Australia.
