  The wife of a fugitive accused of killing two police officers has urged him to
  surrender and says she will cooperate fully with authorities. Dezi Freeman,
  also known as Desmond Filby, fled into the bush on Tuesday after a fatal
  confrontation at a property in Porepunkah, about 300km north-east of
  Melbourne. He is accused of killing Det Leading Sen Const Neal Thompson, 59,
  and Sen Const Vadim de Waart, 35. More than 450 police officers have been
  deployed to the rural community as part of the search, which has included
  examining disused mines, caves and dugouts. Freeman’s wife, Amalia Freeman, on
  Sunday shared her “deep sorrow” over the deaths of the two officers. “We are
  truly sorry for your loss, and the suffering and grief that the families,
  friends and colleagues of [Thompson and De Waart] are now experiencing. My
  children and I grieve for the loss of your loved ones,” Freeman said in a
  statement provided to media including Guardian Australia. Freeman said she and
  her children “respect the important work of Victoria police and do not hold
  anti-authority views”. “We echo the requests of the Victoria police for the
  swift and safe conclusion of this tragedy,” her statement said. “I lend my
  full support to Victoria police in their search for my husband and will
  co-operate with Victoria Police in any way that I can.” Freeman urged her
  husband to contact police and give himself up and also appealed to those who
  may have information about his whereabouts. “Please Dezi, if you see or hear
  this, call 000 and arrange a surrender plan with the police,” her statement
  said. “If anyone is harbouring, helping or supporting Dezi, please call 000
  immediately and speak with the police. “If anyone has seen Dezi or knows
  anything that may help the police to understand his whereabouts, even if it is
  just a snippet of information, please call 000 immediately.” Police say they
  have received several reported sightings of Freeman since he went on the run,
  although none have been confirmed. “There have been alleged sightings which
  we’re exploring,” the Victoria police chief commissioner, Mike Bush, told
  reporters on Thursday. “We can’t confirm that they are of him but if you think
  you see him, let us know. We’ll explore it.” Blizzard-like conditions and
  heavy rain have hampered the search. Potential links between Freeman and a
  61-year-old man who has been charged with weapons and drug offences are being
  investigated. Victoria police on Sunday said they had arrested a 61-year-old
  man in Bright just before 5pm on Friday. Police seized weapons and “a quantity
  of cannabis” from the house they found him in, they alleged. The man was
  charged with possessing an imitation firearm and possessing cannabis. Sign up:
  AU Breaking News email He was bailed to appear before Myrtleford magistrates
  court on 3 October, police said. Police said whether the Bright man was
  associated with Freeman “forms part of the ongoing investigation” into the
  fugitive accused of killing two police officers. The search for Freeman on
  Sunday dragged into its sixth day with hundreds of police continuing to scour
  Victoria’s high country wilderness. The town of Porepunkah was much quieter
  than it usually would be on a weekend during the ski season. Police were
  expecting the search to continue. A police forward command post was relocated
  on Saturday from Feathertop Winery just outside Porepunkah to a government
  office in the town of Ovens, about 12km away. “The new site is a
  fit-for-purpose facility and will best support Victoria Police’s operational
  activity moving forward,” the force said. “We would like to reassure the
  community that police are not leaving the area.” The car park at the new
  command post at the was full of plain and marked police cars on Sunday.
  Officers could be seen wearing bullet proof vests. On Thursday night Freeman’s
  42-year-old wife and a 15-year-old boy were arrested during a raid at a
  Porepunkah address. They were interviewed and released. Police helicopters and
  drones have been circling the area for days in the hope of catching a sign of
  the fugitive. Freeman, who has bush survival experience, was last seen in dark
  green tracksuit pants, a dark green rain jacket, Blundstone boots and reading
  glasses, police said. He is believed to be a “sovereign citizen”, a follower
  of a pseudo-legal ideology that rejects government authority and the rule of
  law.
