  Japanese interval walking: the viral exercise trend that could put a spring in
  your step

  If the thought of pumping iron or holding a plank doesn’t put a spring in your
  step, maybe the latest exercise trend to dominate social media will: Japanese
  interval walking. The idea is simple: alternate between three minutes of fast
  and three minutes of slow walking, ideally for 30 minutes at a time. “The fast
  walking pace is typically fast [enough] that you are not able to speak in long
  sentences,” said Dr Kristian Karstoft, an associate professor at the
  University of Copenhagen, who has studied the method. “And then the slow
  intervals are so slow that you are able to recover.” He added that people
  could often find it challenging to walk slowly enough during these intervals.
  Putting the approach to the test, I hit the area around King’s Cross in
  central London. I began striding out, as though late for a train. Three
  minutes later my watch beeped and I slowed down, pottering along as if
  searching for a dropped earring. Another beep and I sped up once more, arms
  swinging. I was slightly worried what passersby might think of my erratic pace
  – I suspect I looked as if I needed the loo but dared not risk a jog. Already
  I was regretting attempting this without my two flat-coated retrievers: if
  they were in tow I could at least have blamed my dawdling intervals on their
  lamp-post sniffing. After 30 minutes I felt warm, but not exactly out of puff.
  Karstoft said the approach was particularly suited to people prone to running
  injuries, as walking is less hard on the joints, or middle-aged or older
  adults who do not do much regular training. People who were already pretty
  fit, he said, would need to jog or run for intervals to experience similar
  benefits. The regime is similar to high-intensity interval training (Hiit). Dr
  Shaun Phillips, a senior lecturer in sport and exercise physiology at the
  University of Edinburgh, said: “High-intensity exercise can give similar
  benefits to moderate-intensity exercise but in a shorter time frame [or] with
  a lower volume of exercise. The use of high-intensity places a bigger stimulus
  on the body to adapt.” But not everyone can keep up a furious pace, even when
  walking. Phillips said people who were less active or fit should start with
  normal walking to get into the swing of it, and then try interval walking. “A
  way to maximise your ability to do high-intensity training is to do it with
  the alternating intensities, meaning the interval-based training,” Karstoft
  said. While high-intensity interval walking has recently become popular on
  TikTok, where enthusiasts share videos of themselves earnestly striding around
  town parks, the idea goes back more than 20 years when scientists in Japan
  began studying it in middle-aged and older adults. According to one Japanese
  study, involving an analysis of data from 139 healthy participants with an
  average age of 63, people who did high-intensity interval walking on four or
  more days a week over a five-month period increased their peak aerobic
  capacity, indicating an improvement in physical fitness. What’s more, these
  improvements were greater than for participants who had undertaken a walking
  regime of continuous, moderate intensity or who did no walking training. The
  study also suggested high-intensity interval walking may reduce blood pressure
  and increase the strength of the knee joint. A small randomised control trial
  by Karstoft and his colleagues found the approach could also benefit people
  with type 2 diabetes, including by improving their glycaemic control. Four
  months of high-intensity interval walking was associated with greater benefits
  than continuous walking, even though the overall energy expenditure and mean
  training intensity were the same. “Typically with interval walking, we’ve seen
  a gain in fitness level of around 15% to 20% compared to trivial or no
  improvements in fitness levels when subjects are doing the continuous walking
  [or no walking],” Karstoft said. “We’ve seen improvements in body composition
  with an average weight loss during four to six months of training of around
  three to five kilograms, mainly due to fat mass.” A review on the topic
  published by Karstoft and his colleagues last year concluded that Japanese
  interval walking was a feasible and effective training regimen for older,
  fragile people. “It significantly enhances fitness, muscle strength, and
  health markers,” they wrote. But, Phillips acknowledged, while some people
  like the challenge of higher intensity periods of exercise, others hate it.
  “We’re certainly never going to come to the ideal exercise protocol that
  everybody loves,” he said. “It’s about trying to give as many workable and
  beneficial options as possible that people can pick from.”
