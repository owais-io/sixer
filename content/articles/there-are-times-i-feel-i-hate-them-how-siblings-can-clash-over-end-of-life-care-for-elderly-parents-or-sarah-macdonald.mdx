  When Anna’s* parents came to visit last year, she was determined to give them
  a relaxing holiday in her Queensland beach town. She’d been worried about them
  – her mum had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and her dad had been
  having frequent falls. For years she’d been trying to get them to talk about
  whether they needed to move to aged care, to assess their financial situation
  and face what was coming next, but they’d dismissed her, saying they were
  fine. On the first day of their visit, Anna’s dad fell and broke his leg,
  badly. “He went into hospital and Mum came and stayed with me. I realised what
  they’d been covering up. Mum was so confused she was walking around the house
  without any pants on, which was confronting for my teenage boys. She didn’t
  know what day it was and she couldn’t read a clock. Then the hospital told me
  Dad was withdrawing from alcohol and had some dementia.” Anna moved her
  parents to a nearby aged care centre while her sister packed up the family
  home. The sisters had always had some issues in their relationship but the
  stress of seeing their parents so vulnerable, of selling the house and working
  through the financial situation, led to harsh words and hurtful accusations.
  Anna’s sister told their parents they were arguing. “They were distraught. It
  was awful. I had to set some boundaries, and I just stopped all
  communication.” Caregiving can expose cracks in families and widen them to
  caverns. Since I’ve been working in this area, I’ve heard many stories like
  Anna’s and spoken to experts about how families can fall apart just when they
  need to come together. There’s often resentment about the burden of care on
  one child, conflict around the pressure of making huge decisions and the
  horror of the “sad-min” of form filling. Issues around money are particularly
  messy. And families who have had past conflict and trauma are particularly at
  risk. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Research released on
  Thursday by online care platform Violet reveals the depth of anxiety
  surrounding Australia’s ageing population and gives insights into families who
  love deeply but plan poorly. Its poll of a thousand people found more than
  three-quarters of Australians are concerned that caregiving will damage their
  relationships with family members and 70% worry about managing past family
  conflicts and unresolved trauma when caregiving. Previous studies have shown
  45% of caregivers experience relatively serious conflict with another family
  member, usually because one sibling tends to carry the heaviest load. Each
  statistic tells a unique and personal story of relationship breakdown,
  resentment and real anguish. But the consequences affect us all, because the
  conflict often plays out in publicly funded late-stage hospital care. A study
  published in the British Medical Journal in 2019 found patients whose families
  are in conflict were nearly 10 times more likely to receive unbeneficial
  treatment towards the end of their life. Ken Hillman, professor of intensive
  care at the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of New South Wales,
  has been warning about the cost of misaligned care in the last moments of life
  since the 1980s. His most recent research in the Internal Medicine Journal
  cited overtreatment as a major contributor to decreased capacity of hospitals,
  reduced ability to conduct elective surgery, increased attendances at
  emergency departments and ambulance ramping. Hillman says family conflict is
  the biggest cause of non-beneficial treatment at the end of life. “I’m not too
  sure if it’s guilt or existing conflict or just not facing the problem, but
  one sibling will often demand life support because they want to believe in
  hope or a miracle.” Prof Imogen Mitchell also sees the cost of conflict in her
  job as an intensive care specialist at Canberra hospital. She says most
  families haven’t even thought about whether they’d want their loved one going
  to intensive care and this can lead to panic. “Often sons are more wedded to
  keeping them alive, saying, ‘She’s a fighter’, whereas it’s often a daughter
  who does more of the care who will say ‘I’m not sure Mum would want all this’.
  Often, a new wife and the children of the patient will be in conflict – the
  wife wants all treatment that is possible and the children will be more
  pragmatic. Meanwhile, we hold a patient in suspension while family members get
  on the same page.” Often this can take time because all sorts of family issues
  can play out. Mitchell urges people to know their loved one’s wishes before
  they are in a hospital corridor or get a call from a specialist. “I could
  count on one hand families that have had this conversation … it can bring a
  family together if they all know what would Mum want.” Professors Mitchell and
  Hillman recommend comprehensive planning for life’s final years. Families need
  guidance to navigate complex medical decisions and care coordination.
  Different states have different recommendations for health directives, but
  clearly we need better guidance and fundamental planning tools. Parents hate
  it when their children fight – setting the rules around ageing with clear
  direction and communication may be the best gift they can give their children
  and themselves. Not all conflict can be avoided but some plain old
  appreciation for those who do the hard work in caring is a good place to
  start. Sharon* in Sydney spends half her week driving her father to
  appointments, cooking his meals and cleaning his flat. She does it with love
  but concedes the lack of the slightest bit of interest from her two siblings
  has lessened her love for them. “Just an acknowledgment and a pat on the back
  would go a long way. There are times I even feel I hate them.” Often healing
  old wounds in families is too difficult. But at least putting them aside or
  not developing new divides is the least we can do for those people who gave us
  life. *Names have been changed Sarah Macdonald is a writer, broadcaster, an
