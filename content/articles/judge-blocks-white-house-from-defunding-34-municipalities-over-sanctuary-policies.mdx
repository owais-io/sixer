  A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal
  funding to 34 “sanctuary cities” and counties that limit cooperation with
  federal immigration law enforcement, significantly expanding a previous order.
  The order, issued on Friday by the San Francisco-based US district judge
  William Orrick, adds Los Angeles and Chicago, as well as Boston, Baltimore,
  Denver and Albuquerque, to cities that the administration is barred from
  denying funding. Orrick, an Obama appointee, previously ruled it was
  unconstitutional for the Trump administration to freeze funding to local
  governments with “sanctuary” policies, limiting their cooperation with
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The April ruling came after cities
  including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle sued the
  administration over what they claimed were illegal executive orders signed by
  Donald Trump in January and February that threatened to cut off funding if
  Democrat-controlled cities do not cooperate. Cities and counties suing the
  administration contend that the executive orders amount to an abuse of power
  that violate the constitution. The administration argues that the federal
  government should not be forced to subsidize policies that thwart its control
  of immigration. The administration has since ordered the national guard into
  Los Angeles and Washington DC, both cities with sanctuary designations, under
  a law-and-order mandate. On Friday, Trump said Chicago is likely the next
  target for efforts to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal
  immigration. “I think Chicago will be our next,” Trump told reporters at the
  White House, later adding: “And then we’ll help with New York.” The number of
  people in immigration detention has soared by more than 50% since Trump’s
  inauguration, according to an Axios review published Saturday, reaching a
  record 60,000 immigrants in long-term detention or around 21,000 more than at
  the end of the Biden administration. Separately, the US attorney general, Pam
  Bondi, last week issued fresh threats to 30 Democrat-led cities and states,
  including to the governors of California, Illinois and Minnesota, and the
  mayors of New York, Denver and Boston, to drop sanctuary policies. Bondi said
  in the letter that their jurisdictions had been identified as those that
  engage “in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration
  enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States”. “This
  ends now,” Bondi wrote. Democrat leaders uniformly rejected the Trump
  administration’s assertion. Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, said in response
  that Bondi’s order was “some kind of misguided political agenda” that “is
  fundamentally inconsistent with our founding principles as a nation”. The
  accelerating confrontation between the administration and Democratic-led
  jurisdictions comes as the Pentagon began ordering 2,000 national guard troops
  in Washington to carry firearms. US officials told NBC News that the US
  defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, had authorized national guard members who are
  supporting local law enforcement will probably carry weapons but troops
  assigned to city beautification roles would not. The official said troops
  supporting the mission “to lower the crime rate in our nation’s capital will
  soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their
  mission and training”, according to the outlet.
