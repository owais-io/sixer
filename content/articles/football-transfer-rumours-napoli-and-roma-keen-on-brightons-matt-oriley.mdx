  The question of who will lead the Manchester United forward line remains
  uncertain. Ruben Amorim has been blunt in his assessment of Rasmus Højlund,
  despite the player’s desire to stay. United could offer the striker to RB
  Leipzig and plan a separate deal for the Bundesliga club’s Benjamin Sesko, who
  would cost at least £55m. All aboard the merry-go-round. Jadon Sancho could be
  on his way back to Borussia Dortmund, where he spent the second half of the
  2023-24 season on loan. The 25-year-old winger clearly enjoyed his second
  spell with the club and is said to be pushing for a permanent move after being
  left out of United’s pre-season tour. The Englishman, who joined United in a
  £73m deal from Dortmund in 2021, has reportedly agreed to a 50% pay cut to
  make the move happen. Chelsea are rumoured to be preparing a bid for another
  outcast, Alejandro Garnacho, before the transfer window closes. The Juventus
  midfield is in a bit of a state. With the futures of Douglas Luiz and Weston
  McKennie uncertain, the Old Lady are looking for reinforcements. They’ve
  joined Atalanta, Napoli, and Roma in expressing an interest in Brighton’s Matt
  O’Riley. Juventus are holding out for €40m for Douglas Luiz, who has
  reportedly skipped training to force a move to Nottingham Forest. McKennie,
  whose contract expires next summer, is reportedly in talks with Milan, so the
  Turin side are open to selling to avoid losing him for nothing. Over at
  Brentford, Yoane Wissa left training early after spending just three hours at
  the club’s training ground. The player is reportedly unhappy and disappointed
  with the club’s stance on his future amid interest from Newcastle. The Bees
  have already turned down a £25m bid for the striker and are reluctant to sell
  after sanctioning the £71m exit of Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United.
  Newcastle, for their part, are still keen on Wissa but are looking at other
  options, while Brentford insist he is not for sale. Liverpool remain keen on
  Marc Guéhi but are not interested in paying Crystal Palace’s £40m valuation,
  especially since the defender will be available for free next summer. West Ham
  are also in the market for a new keeper after Lukasz Fabianski’s contract
  expired. The Hammers have made a formal approach to Leicester for Mads
  Hermansen. The move could be influenced by West Ham’s new goalkeeping coach,
  Casper Ankergren, who previously worked with Hermansen at Brøndby. Wolves have
  agreed a £12m deal with AZ for the left-back David Møller Wolfe, who has
  reportedly said his goodbyes to his teammates ahead of his flight to England.
  In the Championship, Wrexham, hoping to secure a third successive promotion
  this season, are reportedly close to agreeing a deal for Leicester’s Conor
  Coady. The former Wolves player, who has one year left on his contract, had
  also previously been approached by Rangers. Phil Parkinson’s side are also
  closing in on a deal for the Sheffield United striker Kieffer Moore. The
  32-year-old Wales international has a prolific Championship record with 60
  goals in 203 appearances. After a summer of significant spending, Athletic
  Club could be about to pull off their biggest coup yet. Having already
  retained the services of Nico Williams (who snubbed Barcelona to sign a
  mammoth new deal), Robert Navarro and Jesús Areso, the Basque club could be
  re-signing fan favourite Aymeric Laporte. The Spain international, who left
  for Manchester City in 2018, is reportedly desperate to leave Al-Nassr and
  return to his former club. He has already agreed to personal terms and is now
  negotiating a contract termination with the Saudi side. The Al-Nassr manager,
  Jorge Jesus, all but confirmed his departure, saying the player would leave
  and the club would “sign a player with a similar profile”.
