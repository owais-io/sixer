  It’s been a difficult year in southern California, with deadly wildfires,
  immigration raids that have that left communities in fear and thousands of
  soldiers deployed to Los Angeles. In downtown Pasadena over the weekend,
  though, the region received a badly needed dose of joy. On Saturday and
  Sunday, thousands of cat lovers flocked to the city for a weekend dedicated to
  all things feline. Inside the city convention center, there were 200 kittens
  waiting to be adopted and hundreds of vendors selling everything a cat lover
  could dream of: treats, charmingly kitschy tees, crocheted beds and medieval
  period-inspired portraits of regal cats. This is CatCon, or as one guest
  described it: “Disneyland for cat people.” “It’s cuteness overload,” said
  Bianca Chapman, who has attended the conference for the past four years. “I
  can’t stop smiling. I leave here with my face sore.” There is no event for the
  cat-inclined quite like CatCon, which brings together products, educational
  workshops, the celebrities of the kitty world – human and feline – and, of
  course, cat lovers themselves. Here the question is not Do you have a cat?,
  but How many cats do you have? More than 10,000 people attended the two-day
  event and tickets sold out for both days. An entire weekend dedicated wholly
  to cats seemed particularly special for people this year given the hardships
  across the Los Angeles area in recent months. “CatCon is a place where you can
  close out the outside world, and commune with people over our love of
  animals,” said Susan Michals, the event’s founder. “It’s really a happy place,
  and it’s just good fun celebrating our kitty friends.” This year marked the
  expo’s 10th anniversary. Michals, a former journalist and TV producer, founded
  the event in 2015 as cat fever was taking the US by storm with iconic cats
  such as Lil Bub, Grumpy cat and Nala garnering millions of followers online
  and endless cat memes proliferating on seemingly every corner of the internet.
  A lifelong cat lover, Michals had already founded Cat Art Show and saw that
  event drew a younger audience who deeply loved cats and didn’t fit the
  spinster persona so commonly associated with feline enthusiasts in popular
  culture. “There’s still that negative connotation. I realized there was a sort
  of an underserved and untapped population of cat lovers that were not being
  represented,” she said. “And that’s how CatCon was born.” CatCon opened its
  doors in 2015 with Michals aiming to deliver a curated event with workshops,
  meet-and-greets and hip new products. Ultimately, Michals said, her goal has
  been to elevate what it means to be a cat person, debunking the cat lady myth
  while giving back to shelters and advocacy groups. “It’s based in community.
  There was no IRL dog park for the cat enthusiast, because cats are cats,” she
  said as her own cat, the 20-year-old Miss Kitty Pretty Girl, meowed in the
  background, as if on cue. The event has further exploded in popularity amid a
  pandemic-fueled rise in pet ownership. Many visitors are repeat attendees who
  come each year with friends or family. CatCon is diverse with a mix of all
  genders, races and ages. Most people wore something cat-themed, such as
  crocheted tails and sparkly cat ears, and, in at least one case, a full
  leather cat woman costume. Sophia Zavala, dressed in cheetah-print pants, cat
  ears and a shirt from last year’s event that reads “stop staring at my
  kitties”, has come for the last three years with her best friend to check out
  the latest products. “I think it allows the crazy cat ladies to come together.
  I get to hang out with my best friend without our husbands,” she said with a
  chuckle. “We spend with no limits. Both our husbands made us save up for
  today.” For mother and daughter Dulce Figueroa and Angely Mata, who have
  attended multiple times since 2017, the event was a bonding experience and a
  chance to be among fellow cat people. “You know everybody here loves cats,”
  Figueroa said. “It’s just fun.” On the other side of the 55,000 sq ft
  exhibition hall, Tamara Bencivenga and her son, nephew and their friend stood
  at the front of a long line. They were there to meet Sponge Cake and
  Buttercream, two extremely popular globetrotting Scottish folds. It was a
  union years in the making for the LA-area family. They had tried to meet the
  famous felines in Las Vegas and New York without success, but on Saturday,
  Bencivenga and the children, wearing cat ears and light blue shirts adorned
  with an ode to the cats and their owner, got the chance to pet them and say
  hello. “They seemed a little shy, but they just sat still and let us pet
  them,” Bencivenga said afterward, as the children gleefully recalled how “cute
  and chunky” they were. Nearby, another celebrity feline known as “Cat Named
  Calvin” was attracting a line of fans. Besides the handful of celebrity cats,
  there are no actual felines roaming CatCon (people aren’t permitted to bring
  the animals), and that made one corner particularly popular. The Pasadena
  Humane Society, which has continued to house animals displaced by this year’s
  fires, was running an adoption village featuring 200 kittens. People waited in
  some cases upwards of 30 minutes to greet the cats. On Saturday alone, more
  than 100 were adopted. Each time, a staffer would ring a bell and cheers would
  follow across the hall. James Madrid took home a tiny, nimble, yet to be named
  black kitten as a companion for his four-year-old cat, Momo. His girlfriend
  had suggested they go to CatCon, and he was eager to join. “I love cats, man,”
  he said. “I grew up with cats. I come from a cat family.” Bianca Chapman, the
  owner of three black cats named for Egyptian queens, has attended CatCon for
  the last four years, and makes a point to come alone because she always meets
  people. Along with the cat ears and tails, there are no shortage of cheeky
  political statements, such as shirts reading “proud parent of a gay cat” or
  “childless cat lady” and even an almost familiar-looking red hat with the
  slogan “Make cats safe again”. J Morrison, a Brooklyn-based artist and
  longtime vendor at CatCon, sells art based on his own Siamese cat with slogans
  such as “Kittens against Trump”. His booth was popular and often crowded on
  Saturday, something he attributed to a humorous message that resonated with
  people. There is a spirit of diversity and inclusion at CatCon that is
  special, Chapman said, particularly in this moment. People feel accepted here,
  she said, wearing cat ears and a small stuffed cat on her shoulder, and
  shelters and stray cats are showcased and celebrated. “It’s a beautiful
  response to what’s happening right now,” she said. “When you have a pet, you
  can’t help but be tender. I think people are yearning for that. “CatCon is
  showing you can be tender and goofy at any age. People are still finding joy –
  and even activism in their joy.”
