webTitle: Hedda review – Lily Allen leads a helter-skelter take on Ibsen’s tragedy

bodyText: >-
  It is not through any shortcomings of the cast that Matthew Dunster’s
  modern-dress reimagining of Henrik Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler is so peculiar. Lily
  Allen is convincingly brittle as the bored newlywed who has just returned from
  honeymoon with her plodding academic husband, George (Ciarán Owens). His loyal
  aunt, Julia, is exquisitely played by Imogen Stubbs. Julia Chan shines in the
  part of Hedda’s old school friend, Taya, who has left her controlling husband
  and is in the throes of a love affair with the alcoholic academic Jasper (Tom
  Austen, all earnestness here). He is Hedda’s former lover who sparks her
  destructive jealousy, which leads to the play’s explosive ending. The setting
  is a cool, Scandi-style living room with long billowing curtains, beautifully
  designed by Anna Fleischle. But as well-acted and stylish as this production
  is, why does it not convince in its story? Perhaps because it seems neither of
  our time nor of Ibsen’s. Dunster’s adaptation sticks to original events on the
  whole and this fidelity jars against the modern context. The playwright’s
  Hedda is a female Shakespearean antihero, of sorts, an arch manipulator who
  seeks freedom from the confinement of her marriage and position in high
  society. Allen plays the daughter of a music label mogul brought low rather
  than a woman of aristocratic lineage. But when stripped of the specific
  confines of her time, she is less coherent as a character. Her refusal to
  work, for instance, is harder to understand, so Hedda seems like a spoilt
  princess rather than a woman trapped by, but also resisting, patriarchy.
  George does not transpose into this world convincingly either: he is not
  adoring nor pliant and you wonder what he is doing with a wife as
  conspicuously unloving as Hedda. There is psychological realism – characters
  speak as they feel – but the language sounds odd and artificial in this
  setting: Hedda implores Jasper to make his suicide “beautiful”, as in Ibsen’s
  script, and speaks of her “disgust” when she is told the bullet that killed
  him was shot into his bowels. Again, it jars. Dunster, also directing, creates
  good intensity in some scenes but the pace of events gathers a speed that
  brings out the melodrama of Ibsen’s plot. Allen shows you her character’s
  power and rage more than her vulnerability but you do not feel her sense of
  narrowing choices, maybe due to the rush of events. It grows fevered, not
  keeping a pace with the psychology of its characters, and by the end, events
  come thick and fast, from Jasper’s drinking binge to trouble with the police,
  a visit to another woman’s home and his misplaced book manuscript (here on a
  laptop). Characters’ emotions swing in one direction and then another. The
  play’s tragedy rests on Hedda’s fear of scandal, after the powerful figure of
  Brack (Brendan Coyle, an MP rather than a judge and compellingly creepy)
  blackmails her. It does not quite chime – maybe scandal does not carry the
  same threat for a woman like Hedda today or perhaps this plot point is just
  not given enough space to grow in its threat. There is tension in the earlier
  acts and some taut moments, but it ends up seeming like a domestic thriller
  rather than a grand tragedy. • At Ustinov Studio, Bath, until 23 August
