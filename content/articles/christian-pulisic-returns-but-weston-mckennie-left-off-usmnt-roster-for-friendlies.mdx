  Christian Pulisic will return to the US men’s national team for the first time
  since his self-imposed absence from the team’s summer slate, having been named
  to the team’s roster for two friendlies against South Korea and Japan in the
  upcoming international window. However, in a surprise move, Juventus
  midfielder Weston McKennie was not named among head coach Mauricio
  Pochettino’s squad. Pochettino named 22 players for the friendlies, with US
  Soccer adding that a 23rd player is expected to be rostered at a later time.
  The federation did not elaborate as to whether this player could be McKennie,
  a US regular who came on as a sub for Juventus over the weekend, or some other
  player. The roster is also notable for a few other absences. Goalkeeper Matt
  Turner, who made an offseason loan move back to MLS in search of regular
  playing time, misses out, as will strikers Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, and
  Patrick Agyemang, midfielder Malik Tillman, and defender Antonee Robinson, all
  of whom are either injured or returning to action after time on the sideline.
  Yunus Musah, who missed out on the 2025 Gold Cup for personal reasons, was
  also not named in the squad. Some players, though, will be celebrating a
  return. That includes Norwich City’s Josh Sargent, who has been on fire to
  start the season, scoring in all four matches he’s played in all competitions
  for the Canaries. Sergiño Dest also makes his return to the US team after
  recovering fully from last season’s ACL tear. Tim Weah is back in the fold as
  well after Club World Cup duties kept him from participating in the Gold Cup.
  The squad is also notable for the holdovers from that Gold Cup squad: 12 in
  total, including goalkeeper Matt Freese, defenders Alex Freeman, Max Arfsten,
  and Nathan Harriel, midfielder Jack McGlynn, and striker Damion Downs. There
  are also a couple of surprise inclusions: 18-year-old center back Noahkai
  Banks, the Hawaii-born German-American who made his Bundesliga debut earlier
  this year with Augsburg, and goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann, the son of former
  US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann. The US play South Korea at Sports Illustrated
  Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey on 6 September at 5pm ET. They then travel to
  Columbus to take on Japan at Lower.com Field on 9 September at 7.30pm ET.
  Here’s the full squad, with breakdowns for each position: Goalkeepers: Roman
  Celentano (FC Cincinnati), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Jonathan Klinsmann
  (Cesena) Klinsmann’s inclusion, and Turner’s exclusion, is one of the bigger
  surprises on the roster. Klinsmann may still be most notable to many US fans
  for his jab at Landon Donovan on social media after his exclusion from the
  2014 World Cup squad – an incident that occurred when he was 17. He has
  struggled for regular playing time for most of his professional career but has
  found it in Serie B, where he’s been a starter for Cesena since midway through
  last season. All in all, this competition is fairly open, though Freese should
  have the upper hand after starting for the US through the Gold Cup. Celentano
  will be looking for his first cap with the US, having only appeared in
  training camps before. Defenders Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Noahkai Banks
  (FC Augsburg), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps), Sergiño Dest (PSV
  Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union),
  Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace) There are some
  regulars in this group one would think could easily start at the 2026 World
  Cup (Richards, Ream and Dest), but the rest are all players looking to secure
  a spot on next year’s roster. Tristan Blackmon, 29, has been rewarded after
  years of solid center-back play for the Vancouver Whitecaps. Banks is an
  intriguing prospect who has made appearances for the US youth teams. Arfsten
  will have the inside track to start at left back with Dest, Freeman and
  Harriel all being more natural on the right. Midfielders: Tyler Adams
  (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Luca de la Torre
  (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo),
  Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew) Tyler Adams will lead this young group after
  doing the same at the Gold Cup over the summer, but the bigger news may be
  about who is not here. McKennie misses out, as does Milan’s Musah, Leeds
  United’s Brenden Aaronson, and Atlético Madrid’s Johnny Cardoso, with the
  latter two having been on the 2025 Gold Cup roster. Sean Zawadzki returns to
  the team after being part of the team’s pre-Gold Cup camp. Forwards: Damion
  Downs (Southampton), Christian Pulisic (Milan) Josh Sargent (Norwich), Tim
  Weah (Marseille), Alex Zendejas (Club América) Pulisic’s return is notable if
  only because of how his past absence kicked off a war of words through the
  media between him and USMNT pundits and past stars of the team. He’ll have a
  point to prove in this camp, where he’ll be joined by the red-hot Sargent and
  Weah, who moved from Juventus to Olympique Marseille over the summer.
  Southampton’s Damion Downs was a surprise inclusion on the 2025 Gold Cup
  roster and he returns here, with injuries impacting the availability of
  numerous other options as detailed above. Winger Alex Zendejas returns to the
  team for the first time in 2025 after impressing with Mexican giants Club
  América.
