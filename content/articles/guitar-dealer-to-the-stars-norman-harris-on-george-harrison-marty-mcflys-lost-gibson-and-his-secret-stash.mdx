  Norman Harris’s career as a guitar dealer went stratospheric one day in 1973,
  when he received a phone call from a friend. “He said he was with someone who
  needed a Les Paul,” recalls the man who runs what is probably the world’s most
  famous guitar shop. “But he wouldn’t tell me who it was. I went over to meet
  them and it was just my friend there. I said: ‘You made me ride all the way
  down here? You made it sound so important.’ And then in walked George Harrison
  with Mal Evans.” Evans was the Beatles’ former road manager. They had been
  next door getting pizza. The business founded in 1975 by Harris – or Norm as
  he is known to his starry regulars, awestruck window-shoppers and legions of
  viewers of his YouTube channel – has grown exponentially. It is located on a
  strip mall in the Tarzana neighbourhood of Los Angeles, alongside a McDonald’s
  and a nail bar. It would be easy to blink and miss Norman’s Rare Guitars,
  unaware of a clientele that includes Slash, Billy Corgan, Dave Grohl, Kiefer
  Sutherland, Melissa Etheridge and Beck dropping by to check out the high-end
  stock, alongside parents buying instruments for their kids – where else would
  Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow go when their son Moses wanted a guitar for
  his 16th birthday? The store – and with it Harris’s life and career – is now
  the subject of a documentary of the same name. Virtuoso blues guitarist Joe
  Bonamassa may be Harris’s most valuable customer. He has one of the world’s
  finest collections of Fender and Gibson guitars, many bought from the
  proprietor’s prized stash. He says Harris is every bit as much of a draw as
  the instruments he sells, like “an electromagnet” attracting people from all
  over the world, yet Harris doesn’t seem to realise he is the star of the show.
  It all began with a secondhand bass guitar. Fifty years ago, Harris was
  playing keyboards in a Miami band when his bandmates asked him to fill in on
  bass. He scoured the local paper for a used instrument and landed on an early
  Fender Jazz bass. “Everyone went gaga over that Fender Jazz,” he says. This
  included his friend Jaco Pastorius, considered by many to be the greatest bass
  player of all time. “I was offered more money for it than I paid for it, so I
  noticed that there was a market and thought maybe I could make a few dollars
  chasing down instruments like that and selling them on. And it just kind of
  rapidly built.” Things were also taking off with Harris’s band, Katmandu –
  Bobby Caldwell was the singer, Little Richard and his brother Peyton Penniman
  were their managers and they had supported the likes of Jimi Hendrix and
  Canned Heat – and were urged to relocate from Florida to California, so that’s
  what Harris and his wife, Marlene, did. The decision was made easier by the
  availability of instruments on the west coast, which inadvertently contributed
  to the end of Harris’s career as a pro musician – business grew so quickly
  that he had no time for much else. “It was kind of a smorgasbord in LA,” he
  says. “There was every instrument I had ever heard about but never actually
  seen, all right there.” Before long, there were 50 or 60 used guitars in the
  couple’s apartment, bought after scouring local newspapers and visiting pawn
  shops. “A lot of the music stores didn’t want to touch used instruments back
  then. And they would laugh at me and say things like: ‘You’re paying more for
  this old guitar than I am for this new guitar.’ I just used to think: ‘OK,
  keep laughing, and just keep selling them to me.’” Harris says he knew in his
  gut that American-made guitars from the mid-1950s to early 60s would one day
  be hugely desirable – “future antiques” he calls them – and he was right.
  While you couldn’t argue that he single-handedly created the vintage guitar
  market, he certainly shaped it, and there is no one else who was as ahead of
  the curve as Harris or as knowledgable about the intricacies and
  idiosyncrasies of each model. He also knew when to say no to a guitar and walk
  away. “I was never interested in just amassing guitars, or having multiples of
  the same guitar. I wanted guitars that were hardly played and all original –
  just prime examples, really.” The strategy paid off that day in 1973 when
  Harrison came calling. Harrison was seeking a replacement for Lucy, his
  one-of-a-kind Gibson Les Paul that had been stolen earlier in the year. It was
  a 1957 Goldtop refinished in red that had formerly been owned by John
  Sebastian of the Lovin’ Spoonful and Rick Derringer of the McCoys, before
  being bought by Eric Clapton and given to Harrison. Clapton used the
  instrument on the Beatles’ While My Guitar Gently Weeps. After the theft, Lucy
  was sold to a musician in LA. Once Harrison had tracked down the guitar, the
  guitar’s new owner argued that he had purchased Lucy in good faith but said he
  would return it to Harrison if he got him another 1950s Les Paul and a Fender
  Precision bass in exchange. This is when a mutual friend became involved, who
  knew that Harris had three 1950s Les Pauls at his apartment. When Harrison
  visited, he bought two 1958 Les Paul Standards – one for the trade, one for
  himself that he fell in love with. Today, each of those guitars, even without
  the Harrison connection, would sell for more than £250,000. “We actually spent
  the day together. I then went to this place he was renting in the Hollywood
  Hills. Ravi Shankar, the Indian sitarist, was there. To me, the Beatles were
  bigger than the pope or the president or whoever. I just kept looking at him –
  I couldn’t believe it was happening.” Harrison offered Harris his Gretsch
  Country Gentleman, used in his Beatles days, in part payment. But Harris
  passed – the biggest mistake he ever made, he says now. “I’m not a huge
  Gretsch fan, and more importantly, I didn’t think anybody would ever believe
  that I’d spent the day with George and bought his Beatles guitar.” He might
  not have made that deal, but they did smoke a lot of hash together that day.
  “It was like having a glass of wine with someone in those days and in those
  circles,” he says. “I did a lot to destroy a number of brain cells in the 60s
  and 70s. But I’m still mostly functioning, and I definitely still remember
  that day.” Robbie Robertson – lead guitarist with the Band, who backed Bob
  Dylan – was a regular customer, having replied to an ad Harris placed in the
  LA Times looking for guitars and being drawn in by Harris’s warmth and
  unbeatable stock. Not that Harris recognised him when he saw him, having never
  seen the Band perform live, despite being a fan. “He was really impressed that
  I had a lot of the stuff he was looking for, so I told him to bring some
  friends. Not long after, he came back with Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell.”
  Harris and Robertson’s friendship was cemented during the filming of The Last
  Waltz, the Band’s 1978 concert film, directed by Martin Scorsese: most of the
  instruments and amplifiers featured were loaned from Harris. Robertson had
  recently bought his 1954 Stratocaster from Harris, then dipped it in bronze.
  Robertson also makes an appearance in Norman’s Rare Guitars, in footage filmed
  just before his death in 2023. “He had cancer and didn’t have long left then,”
  says Harris. “But he said for me, he’d do it. He was such a great guy and a
  good friend.” The Last Waltz wasn’t Harris’s first involvement with the film
  industry. Hal Ashby knew exactly who to ask to supply instruments for his 1976
  Woody Guthrie biopic Bound for Glory. Come 1984, there was only one person who
  could provide the required level of unicorn-like guitars to fill out Nigel
  Tufnel’s collection in This Is Spın̈al Tap. Most famously, Harris loaned the
  producers of Back to the Future the red Gibson played by Marty McFly at the
  Enchantment Under the Sea dance. As has been well documented, the guitar in
  question – a Gibson ES-345 – wasn’t released until 1958, three years after the
  film’s 1955 setting. Harris suggested a period-correct Fender Stratocaster or
  a Gibson ES-5 Switchmaster, but director Robert Zemeckis refused, insisting
  that a time traveller like McFly wouldn’t be constrained by such pettiness.
  After it was returned, Harris sold the guitar. Decades later, a woman walked
  into his shop offering to sell it back to him for $1m. After he stopped
  laughing, he said no, although his shop manager at the time, Mark Agnesi,
  tried to twist his arm, saying that if he had the money, he would buy it
  himself. Agnesi is now director of Gibson, and in a position to spend big on
  such a storied instrument on behalf of the company. Except no one knows where
  it is. Agnesi launched Lost to the Future earlier this year, a global appeal
  for the guitar. The search goes on. Regular viewers of Norman’s Rare Guitars’
  YouTube channel will be familiar with Harris’s warehouse, where he has
  squirrelled away hundreds of museum-grade instruments for a rainy day. Its
  location is known to only a handful of people. “There was this rumour for
  years about that stash,” says Bonamassa. “I’d known Norm for years – and spent
  plenty of money with him – before I was invited out there. It was like that
  scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark – that long shot with all the
  crates. It was unbelievable.” Bonamassa has been to the warehouse many times
  since, and says he always goes with a heavy heart, knowing that he’s going to
  see some “holy grail guitars” that will certainly leave a dent in his wallet.
  “If Norm stashed it away, it meant it was a cut above – the cleanest, the
  straightest, the most original. I went there last year and bought five
  guitars, among them the last of Norm’s blond dot-neck Gibson 335s and a Fender
  Broadcaster.” (Guitar enthusiasts will drool at the very mention.) A portion
  of the film, which was directed by LA filmmaker Devin J Dilmore, is dedicated
  to Harris’s recent health scares. He had cancer, then had a heart attack while
  undergoing treatment. Mortality is clearly on his mind, not least what should
  happen to the business, and all those guitars, when he’s no longer around to
  shake the hand of the person buying them. “I had to get things in order.” he
  says. “Just in case. So I’m going to try to leave as little a mess as I can.”
  “He’s 75,” says Bonamassa. “For years, he’s been saying to me, ‘I want you to
  take over the store.’ But I have a job already. The problem is, if Norm’s not
  there to run it, then it’s just a namesake. It would just be a brand. When you
  take him away, you take away the heart and the soul. It wouldn’t be the same.
  There’s only one Norman Harris.” • Norman’s Rare Guitars is available to rent
