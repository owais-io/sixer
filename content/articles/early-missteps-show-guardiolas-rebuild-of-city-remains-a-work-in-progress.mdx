  The truly great sides always come with an aura. One of the elements that makes
  them so hard to beat is that beating them seems so inconceivable. Even when
  they hit a bad run, the expectation is always that at some point they will
  rediscover their form. To some extent, Manchester City did that last season.
  As miserable as much of the campaign was, after losing to Nottingham Forest at
  the beginning of March, they put together a run of 10 games unbeaten and ended
  up third – even if defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final demonstrated
  the shortcomings that remain. That game showcased City’s flatness at times
  going forward but also a strange openness at the back that was apparent again
  in the 4-3 defeat to Al-Hilal in the Club World Cup. Pep Guardiola sides,
  given how high their line is, will always be susceptible to direct balls
  played in behind them if something goes awry with the press; it’s an
  inevitable part of the risk-reward of that style of play. Even in the 4-0 win
  over Wolves on the opening weekend, there were signs in the early stages of a
  potential weakness to that sort of tactic. It was just that flaw that led to
  Richarlison breaking the offside trap and crossing for Brennan Johnson to open
  the scoring for Spurs at the Etihad on Saturday. Spurs’s second goal, though,
  was just as worrying: goalkeeper James Trafford played an inexplicable pass to
  Nico González’s wrong foot under pressure at the top of his own box. It wasn’t
  an error of execution so much as one of conception. If it were a one-off, that
  might not necessarily be of too much concern, but it was very similar to an
  error Trafford made in Burnley’s defeat at Crystal Palace the season before
  last, leading to a red card for Josh Brownhill. Ederson was the perfect
  goalkeeper for Guardiola, being both good at the traditional aspects of
  goalkeeping and an exceptional passer of the ball. It’s perhaps an understated
  feature of Guardiola’s success how fortunate he has been in his goalkeepers:
  inheriting Víctor Valdés at Barcelona and Manuel Neuer at Bayern, then signing
  Ederson at City. While he, or City, deserve credit for identifying a talent
  like that from Benfica, it came after an error the previous season in
  replacing Joe Hart with Claudio Bravo. Although Ederson only turned 32 earlier
  this month, there was a sense last season that he was on the wane. There were,
  for instance, two big errors late in the first leg of the Champions League
  knockout tie against Real Madrid, and Guardiola preferred Stefan Ortega for
  certain games. Given his high wages and apparent desire for a big payday in
  Saudi Arabia, it’s perhaps no huge surprise that Ederson should be nearing the
  exit. What is surprising is the profile of players lined up to replace him. In
  terms of his passing, Ederson’s stats remained strong last season. Despite an
  average of 5.3 long balls per game, he still averaged over 86% pass
  completion, registering four assists. Trafford last season played 4.3 long
  balls per game in the championship – which at least in theory means he was
  playing more straightforward passes – yet his pass completion rate was just
  70%. In the Premier League the season before, it was 62%, albeit with 6.5 long
  balls per game. City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Gianluigi
  Donnarumma, who has surprisingly found himself outside Luis Enrique’s plans at
  Paris Saint-Germain. Further negotiation is required on a fee, but this seems
  a strikingly odd move for City. Donnarumma is a fine shot-stopper and has made
  a habit of match-winning displays in the biggest games, but he has nothing
  like Ederson’s long-range passing. Although he had an 85% pass completion rate
  in Ligue 1 last season, that was with an average of only 2.6 long balls per
  game. That might suggest Guardiola is looking to go back to basics, to a
  shorter-passing, more possession-based style – but that would go against the
  recent trend both of his football and the wider game towards something less
  risk-averse and more direct. In fact, one of the features that stood out in
  the game against Wolves was how quickly City’s midfield tried to play the ball
  forward. Tijjani Reijnders, in particular, thrived. He was significantly less
  effective against Spurs, with a midfield that harassed him, gave him no space,
  and saw his pass completion drop from 88.3% to 81.4%. City have won only one
  of their last five at home against Spurs, so in that sense Saturday’s result
  was nothing unexpected. What it demonstrated, though, was that a team needs to
  do more than beat Wolves handsomely to prove it is back. Guardiola’s rebuild
  of City remains a work in progress. On this day … The Premiership, as it was
  then called, was only 10 days old when the first hat-trick in the new
  competition was scored. Eric Cantona had already got a treble for Leeds United
  in a 4-3 victory over Liverpool in the Community Shield when, on 25 August
  1995, he scored another hat-trick as Leeds hammered Tottenham 5-0 at Elland
  Road. Rod Wallace pounced on an Erik Thorstvedt error to score the first and
  Lee Chapman added a fifth from Cantona’s lay-off, but in between it was all
  about the Frenchman. First he volleyed in a misplaced clearance from Justin
  Edinburgh, then he headed home David Batty’s cross, before he added his third
  with another volley. But after a 4-0 defeat to Manchester City in November was
  followed by elimination from the League Cup by Watford, the manager Howard
  Wilkinson left Cantona out for a 3-0 win over Arsenal, offering as an excuse a
  fictitious groin strain. A furious Cantona demanded a transfer and soon joined
  Manchester United. Wilkinson seemed almost relieved to be rid of a turbulent
  player, but it was Cantona who inspired Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United to
  their first league title in 26 years. This is an extract from Soccer with
