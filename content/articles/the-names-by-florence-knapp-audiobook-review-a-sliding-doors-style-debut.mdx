  How influential is a name? This is the question underpinning The Names, which
  opens with Cora taking her newborn son to register his birth. Her abusive
  husband Gordon wants his son to be named after him, though, secretly, Cora
  isn’t keen. She notes how the second syllable lands with “a downward thud like
  someone slamming down a sports bag”. She prefers Julian, which means “sky
  father”, though their nine-year-old daughter Maia would like her little
  brother to be called Bear, since it sounds “soft and cuddly … but also brave
  and strong”. Florence Knapp’s smart debut novel features a Sliding Doors-style
  plot in which the three names are tried out for size, each triggering a
  different reality. By defying her husband and choosing Bear, Cora is subjected
  to a beating that prompts a neighbour to intervene and call the police; when
  she names him Julian, young Maia steps in to defend her mother and break the
  tension. And when she registers him as Gordon, peace is maintained but not for
  long; when Cora asks for money to buy baby formula, her husband dispenses a
  different style of punishment. The repercussions of her decision are felt by
  their son, too, whose lives under the different names are traced across three
  decades. The narrator Dervla Kirwan deftly navigates the book’s parallel
  realities, drawing out the lyricism and vividness of Knapp’s prose. Although
  the narrative occasionally strains under the weight of its structure, it
  nonetheless reveals how it is not so much a name that influences a person’s
  life than the actions and character of those who raise them. • Available via

  Audio, 12hr 38min Jenna Coleman narrates Moyes’s family drama revolving around

  Amy Griffin, Penguin Audio, 7hr 40min Griffin, a former venture capitalist and
  friend to the stars, reads her poignant memoir chronicling a traumatic
  childhood in west Texas and her subsequent journey of self-discovery through
