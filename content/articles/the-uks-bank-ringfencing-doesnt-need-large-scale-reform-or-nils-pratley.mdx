  One reason to worry about the chancellor’s plan for deregulation in the
  financial services sector is the dramatic language in which she pitched it.
  Rachel Reeves’s metaphor in her Mansion House speech last month about
  regulation in too many areas acting as “a boot on the neck of business” felt
  wildly over the top when you remember why tougher financial rules were needed
  in the banking sector in the first place. It was because the light-touch
  regulatory era caused the whole economy to be clobbered in the collapses of
  2008-09. In the event, it took until 2019 to implement fully the centrepiece
  of the clean-up operation: bank ringfencing, which requires UK banks of a
  certain size to separate their retail and investment banking activities. Now,
  six years later – no time at all in the grand scheme – the Treasury, lobbied
  by most of the big banks, is contemplating “meaningful” changes to ringfencing
  in the interests of economic growth. It feels far too soon to try anything
  radical. The definition of “meaningful” is vague, it should be said. Outright
  abolition of ringfencing is off the table, thankfully, and some of the
  possibilities floated by the Treasury could be viewed as innocuous. Letting
  banks share back-office resources across the ringfence? Yes, that could be
  regarded as mere housekeeping. Allowing ringfenced banks to provide more
  products to UK businesses? Possibly, if we’re talking about low-octane
  services. But the details do matter. The danger is that, if you create too
  many holes in the fence, you end up defeating the purpose of the construct.
  There are at least three reasons why Reeves should drop the inflammatory
  language and err on the side of caution. First, remember the primary goal: to
  ensure that the state never has to bail out banks again – at least not the
  riskier trading activities. The plea from reformists is that other measures,
  such as stiffer capital requirements and “living wills” to organise an orderly
  wind-down, do the same job. Yet ringfencing is surely genuinely different
  because it is a structural measure: the core UK deposit-taking operations have
  to sit inside their own legal entity. Maximum protection for the
  deposit-taking core still feels a sound principle given what happened in
  2008-09, and how the whole of the wretched Royal Bank of Scotland was dragged
  down. Second, ringfencing may lower funding costs for banks. The perception of
  greater resilience should, in theory, attract a funding bonus. Put another
  way, regulators – with their eye on the overall stability of the system –
  might demand even higher capital buffers if ringfencing were to be
  meaningfully weakened. Would-be abolitionists grumble about the costs of
  trapped capital. Fair enough, but they probably wouldn’t like bigger capital
  buffers either. Third, if the chancellor’s aim is more growth, why make it
  easier for UK banks to chase higher returns outside the UK? She should listen
  to the commonsense point made by Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of
  England: “Removing the ringfence would most likely have a negative effect on
  UK lending, both in terms of cost and quantities.” If ringfencing has meant
  cheaper mortgages, it would be a political risk for a chancellor to mess with
  the formula. None of which is to pretend that ringfencing has been a free
  lunch. Friction and expense clearly exist; the big banks spent a small fortune
  setting up the structures and have to carry extra overheads. Competition may
  also have suffered as big, ringfenced banks have concentrated on UK mortgage
  lending, and smaller banks have been forced towards riskier lending. Visions
  of a post-crisis world full of dynamic “challenger” banks never materialised.
  But that is just to say that trade-offs exist. For the UK, a country that
  simply cannot afford another crisis like 2008’s, financial stability should
  still be the priority. A few minor fiddles might be an improvement because no
  design is perfect. But major reform is not needed.
