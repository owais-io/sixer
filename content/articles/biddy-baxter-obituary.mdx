  Biddy Baxter, who has died aged 92 after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease
  and breast cancer, carved out a place in television history by shaping the
  hugely successful format of the world’s longest-running children’s magazine
  show, Blue Peter – while in charge of it for a quarter of a century. She took
  over as producer in 1962 – four years after its inception – to overhaul a
  factual programme then described by BBC management as being like “a rundown
  property with potential for improvement”. Its audience of primary school-age
  children originally saw Christopher Trace, an actor, and Leila Williams, a
  former Miss Great Britain, presenting the 15-minute weekly show, which began
  with film of a three-masted schooner lowering its Blue Peter flag, signalling
  the start of a voyage, accompanied by the 1930s hornpipe theme tune, Barnacle
  Bill. The live broadcast was almost entirely studio-based and short on action,
  with the broadcasting historian Asa Briggs later writing: “Chris played with
  trains. Leila played with dolls.” A fairer assessment would note that items
  such as cartoons, stories and competitions were also part of the formula and
  the graphic artist Tony Hart made occasional appearances. At the start of
  1962, Williams was fired, leaving Trace on his own for a while before being
  joined briefly by Anita West. When Baxter was earmarked to take charge but
  still serving notice in her BBC radio job, a temporary producer replaced West
  with Valerie Singleton. Her serious style, talking to children in an
  unpatronising manner, perfectly complemented Trace’s relaxed, amiable
  personality to give Baxter a firm basis for moving Blue Peter into a new age.
  With a budget of only £180 per edition, she saw viewer involvement as the key.
  Just before Christmas 1962, Blue Peter launched two initiatives that would
  become staples of the programme. The first of its annual appeals, asking
  children to donate toys for those who would otherwise have no presents, was
  followed by an idea from the show’s director, Edward Barnes – her “number two”
  and later head of BBC children’s programmes – to introduce a dog as a member
  of the Blue Peter team. Unfortunately, the chosen pup died of distemper two
  days after its first appearance and, not wanting to upset the young audience,
  the pair discreetly found a replacement that spent its first night at Baxter’s
  flat, leaving its mark on every carpet. When the puppy “returned” to the
  programme, viewers were asked to suggest a name – and Petra became a mainstay
  until her death in 1977. Other pets followed. Assisted by Barnes and a
  researcher, Rosemary Gill, Baxter continued her transformation of the show in
  1963 by commissioning Hart to design a logo that would be firmly identified
  with it. His galleon emblem, tying in with the nautically inspired title, was
  immediately featured on another inspired invention, the Blue Peter badge,
  which would never be a giveaway, but a prize earned by viewers for writing in
  with programme ideas, stories, letters and pictures. Alongside this, Baxter
  established a card index system to ensure that they would never receive the
  same reply twice, having been devastated as a child to find that she received
  the same standard letter back when she twice wrote to her favourite author,
  Enid Blyton. Another winning element to be added in 1963 came after Margaret
  Parnell sent in a collection of dolls’ hats and instructions on how to
  assemble them. As Baxter built up a team of expert contributors, “makes” –
  creating items using household materials such as “sticky-backed plastic” –
  proved hugely popular. “Here’s one I made earlier” became a national
  catchphrase. In 1965, a year after Blue Peter’s running time was increased to
  25 minutes and a second weekly episode added, Baxter was given the new title
  of editor. Barnes and Gill became her producers and, together, the trio made
  the programme a national institution. At the same time, film of summer trips
  where the presenters discover other countries became another popular item, and
  John Noakes was added as a third presenter, notable for his daredevil
  escapades such as climbing Nelson’s Column. After Peter Purves replaced Trace,
  he, Singleton and Noakes became the most famous trio to front Blue Peter
  during its formative years. However, Baxter’s iron grip on the show – and
  memories of her high heels clattering across the studio floor – irked those
  such as Singleton, who said she treated them like children, and led Noakes to
  observe that he thought she regarded him as “some country yokel from
  Yorkshire”. Although Purves described her as a “control freak”, he
  acknowledged: “I didn’t always agree with her views, but she was right.” Biddy
  was born Joan Baxter in Leicester, to Vera (nee Briers), a pianist in local
  shows, and Bryan Baxter, a teacher who went on to own a sportswear company.
  While attending Wyggeston girls’ grammar school, she acted at the Little
  Theatre, Leicester. She said that her broadcasting work aimed at a mass
  audience was informed by her time in Durham while studying for a social
  sciences degree at the university’s women’s college, St Mary’s (1952-55). “For
  someone from the affluent Midlands like me, it was a revelation to see the
  impoverished conditions that some people lived in at the time,” Baxter told
  the Guardian’s Martin Wainwright in 2012. “I am so grateful to have had this
  opportunity to live in north-east England.” In 1955, she joined BBC radio as a
  studio manager, rising three years later to producer of Listen with Mother
  and, for schools broadcasting, the Junior English programme. During an
  attachment to BBC television during 1961, Baxter produced The Hot Chestnut
  Man, a children’s show of stories told by Johnny Morris, before joining Blue
  Peter the following year. She left in 1988 to move abroad with her long-time
  partner, John Hosier, a former producer of music for BBC TV and radio schools
  programmes who went to Hong Kong to help set up its Academy for Performing
  Arts. They returned to Britain on his retirement in 1993 and, from 1989 to
  2000, Baxter was a consultant to the BBC’s director general. She was made MBE
  in 1981 and presented with Bafta’s special children’s award in 2013. Baxter
  and Hosier married in 2000, shortly before his death that year. • Biddy (Joan
  Maureen) Baxter, television producer, born 25 May 1933; died 10 August 2025
