  The independent anti-slavery commissioner has launched an investigation into
  so-called pimping websites amid concern at the level of exploitation of
  trafficked and vulnerable women on those platforms. Eleanor Lyons will
  interview women who say they have been trafficked into sex work and advertised
  on adult services websites such as Vivastreet that allow users to browse
  images and videos of women selling sex in their local area. The investigation
  follows on from a 2021 Scottish parliamentary study on commercial and sexual
  exploitation, which found that the ease and speed with which pimps and
  traffickers can now advertise their victims to potential customers had
  “turbocharged the sex-trafficking trade”. “Adult service websites, where you
  can go online, type in your postcode and find hundreds of women for sale, are
  a hotbed for trafficking,” Lyons said. “We will do a full call for evidence on
  why these websites are so damaging. At a bare minimum, they should be far more
  heavily regulated.” The sites have a duty to report evidence of trafficking
  and exploitation to the police, but campaign groups have warned that police
  often fail to spot victims of exploitation. “There’s a really inconsistent
  approach by law enforcement around the country; there’s often a real
  nervousness when it comes to interacting with women in those environments.
  Many of these women have a natural distrust of law enforcement and
  authorities, and they have often been told to have that distrust by the people
  that are exploiting them,” Lyons said. Signs of potential trafficking might be
  seeing the same women advertised multiple times at different locations, or
  when the same phone number is used for different women, suggesting that
  someone is controlling their work. “I find it shocking that there are websites
  where women are openly being advertised and they are so unregulated. I think
  the lack of awareness about adult service websites is alarming, particularly
  when we know there’s a high correlation between women and girls who are
  sexually exploited and sexually trafficked who appear on these websites,”
  Lyons said. “The online world has massively facilitated the sexual
  exploitation of women.” A Vivastreet spokesperson said: “Vivastreet is
  regulated by Ofcom under the Online Safety Act and takes safety extremely
  seriously. As required by law, we deploy a range of measures to detect, report
  and remove potentially exploitative content, including requiring all adult
  category advertisers to undergo age and ID verification. All our adverts are
  screened via a range of indicators informed by police advice, with suspicious
  content referred proactively to a central policing unit.” Some women working
  in the sex industry argue that the transition to advertising their services
  online has allowed them to work more safely and independently, enabling them
  to screen clients before meeting them. But Lyons said the shift had also made
  it harder for organisations to support exploited women. “Previously, charity
  workers would have been able to walk around areas where they knew that they
  may come across women and girls who were being sexually exploited on the
  street and reach out to them directly, to provide them with care and offer
  them support. The internet means that a lot of this has gone online and is now
  happening behind closed doors, in rented Airbnbs, in flats, in a much less
  visible form, so it’s easier for traffickers to move victims around.” An Ofcom
  spokesperson said: “The UK’s Online Safety Act requires sites and apps to
  protect people from illegal content, including facilitating the sexual
  exploitation of adults and human trafficking. We’re closely scrutinising
  companies’ compliance with their duties.” A group of 59 cross-party MPs signed
  an amendment to the crime and policing bill earlier this year that would have
  made it a criminal offence to “enable or profit from the prostitution of
  another person, including by operating a website hosting adverts for
  prostitution”. The amendment was not put to a vote. The independent
  anti-slavery commissioner’s team will conduct interviews in September and plan
  to publish their report shortly afterwards.
