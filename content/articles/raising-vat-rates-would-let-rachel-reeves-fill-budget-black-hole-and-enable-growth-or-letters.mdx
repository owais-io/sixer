  Tax rises appear increasingly likely. Polly Toynbee discusses some possible
  tax changes, including VAT (Both left and right agree taxes must rise. Time
  for Labour to get creative, 12 August). My view is that a 2.5 percentage point
  rise in the average VAT rate is the most viable option to raise sufficient
  revenue without reducing growth. Toynbee also discusses possible changes to
  inheritance tax and the introduction of a wealth tax. These policies may be
  redistributive but are unlikely to raise substantial revenue. As an example,
  Norway currently imposes a wealth tax that raises less than 3% of its
  non-petroleum tax revenue. Given the urgent need for revenue, a VAT raise is
  likely to be the UK’s best option. First, VAT raises significant revenue, at
  about 17% of total UK tax revenue. This means that a 2.5 percentage point
  increase may raise as much as £21bn yearly. This is roughly five times more
  than what it is expected the government will raise from the stricter taxation
  of non-domiciles. Second, VAT poses limited harm to growth. Since it also
  applies to people who are outside the labour market, it dampens work
  incentives less than income taxes do. A VAT rise may partially replace the
  government’s failure to reform disability benefits. In addition, increases in
  VAT do not reduce incentives to save, as costs go up by the same ratio today
  and in the future. And third, VAT can be quite progressive. While new savings
  are unaffected, old savings that people spend in the future are subject to VAT
  increases. Most importantly, while the VAT rate is flat, using the revenue to
  support public services disproportionally benefits the poor. This means that
  raising sufficient revenue may be most important for progressivity. Kristoffer
  Berg Lecturer, Trinity College, University of Cambridge • Anent Polly
  Toynbee’s tax suggestions for Labour, if it regains its heart, may I add two.
  The best taxes not only raise money but also do societal good. So why not use
  one to address climate, inequity and safety issues, by taxing cars by their
  weight and annual mileage as reported at the MOT test? Both relate directly to
  their energy use. Anthony Seaton Emeritus professor of environmental medicine,
  University of Aberdeen
