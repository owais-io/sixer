  Ukraine acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that Russia’s army had
  entered the Dnipropetrovsk region, a central administrative area previously
  spared from intense fighting. “Yes, they have entered, and fighting is ongoing
  as of now,” said Viktor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukrainian forces in
  Dnipro, Ukraine’s fourth-largest city. Russian forces have slowly gained
  ground in costly battles for largely devastated areas in eastern and southern
  Ukraine, normally with few inhabitants or intact buildings left. Separately,
  Ukraine’s military general staff rejected Moscow’s claims to have fully
  captured the villages of Zaporizke and Novogeorgiivka just inside
  Dnipropetrovsk oblast. But battlefield monitor DeepState, which has close ties
  to Ukraine’s military, said on Tuesday that Russia had “occupied” them and was
  “consolidating its positions [and] accumulating infantry for a further
  advance”. Dnipropetrovsk is not one of the five Ukrainian regions – Donetsk,
  Kherson, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea – that Moscow has illegally annexed
  as Russian territory. Ukrainian men aged 18 to 22 are now allowed to cross the
  border freely in either direction under martial law, the prime minister, Yulia
  Svyrydenko, has announced. “This applies to all citizens in this age group.
  The decision also concerns citizens who, for various reasons, are located
  outside Ukraine,” said Svyrydenko. “We want Ukrainians to maintain a maximum
  of links with Ukraine.” Previous regulations introduced after Russia’s
  February 2022 invasion barred men aged 18-60 from leaving the country.
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had met with military leadership about the
  situation at the frontline and in the border areas. “We discussed in detail
  the key needs of each direction and units. It is very important that the
  nature of the situation in the border areas of Sumy and Kharkiv regions is
  determined by our units.” Ukraine’s president added: “Of course, we pay due
  attention to the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions. We discussed the needs for
  additional supplies for these directions. The commander-in-chief reported on
  the implementation of the headquarters’ decisions on providing reserves for
  the defence forces.” Zelenskyy said contact was being made with Turkey, the
  Gulf states and European countries about hosting talks if Vladimir Putin ended
  up agreeing. “From our side, things will be prepared to the maximum in order
  to end the war,” said the Ukrainian president. Ukrainian top presidential aide
  Andriy Yermak and national security council chief Rustem Umerov were in Doha
  on Tuesday meeting with the Qataris. Zelenskyy added: “Russia is only giving
  signals that it is going to continue to avoid real negotiations. This can only
  be changed by strong sanctions, strong tariffs – real pressure.” The Finnish
  president, Alexander Stubb, said he hoped Donald Trump’s patience with Putin
  would run out soon. Stubb said he had warned Trump that Putin was deploying a
  “typical” Russian delaying tactic to avoid meeting Zelenskyy. Finland and
  other European countries “will do everything we can do achieve lasting peace”,
  Stubb said. On security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelenskyy said their “defence
  component … should be detailed in the near future”. In Brussels on Tuesday,
  the EU foreign affairs spokesperson Anitta Hipper said the EU’s foreign policy
  chief, Kaja Kallas, had overnight been on a call with Marco Rubio, the US
  secretary of state, and several European foreign ministers. European
  Commission spokesperson Paula Pinho said there should soon be a report from
  national security advisers on what would be put forward for Ukraine’s
  security. A combat drone, presumed to be Ukrainian, went off course and
  exploded over Estonia without causing any casualties, the Baltic state and
  close Ukraine ally said on Tuesday, AFP reported. Pieces were found by an
  agricultural worker near the south-eastern town of Tartu, 75km (45 miles) from
  the border with Russia. Margo Palloson, director general of Estonia’s Internal
  Security Service (ISS), said it was believed the drone was aimed at Russia but
  “diverted from its trajectory by Russian GPS jamming and other electronic
  warfare means, causing it to enter Estonian airspace”.
