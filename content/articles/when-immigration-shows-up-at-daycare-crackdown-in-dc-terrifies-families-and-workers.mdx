  workers

  Early on Tuesday morning, as parents went to drop off their young children at
  a bilingual childcare center in north-west Washington DC, they received a
  message from the administrator saying that unmarked cars were parked directly
  outside. Shortly after 8am, federal agents in tactical vests arrested two
  people unaffiliated with the center, the administrator said. “While these
  activities are not connected to our program, we are closely monitoring the
  situation and taking extra precautions to ensure everyone feels safe entering
  and leaving the building,” read the message to parents, reviewed by the
  Guardian. Foram Mehta, whose son attends the daycare, said she had feared
  immigration raids there for months, but her fears escalated when Donald Trump
  sent national guard troops and federal agents to Washington two weeks ago. She
  said she was concerned about her own safety as a brown person, even though
  she’s an immigrant in the country lawfully, and also worries for her
  undocumented neighbors. She, and other Washington residents, including
  undocumented parents and caregivers, said they were avoiding parts of the city
  where federal agents have been reported, and she said her parents who are
  visiting were “strictly forbidden to go anywhere alone – even down the street
  to the grocery store”. In a city already upended by the second Trump
  administration’s mass firings of government workers, Trump’s decision to take
  over the city’s police force, send thousands of federal agents to Washington,
  and ramp up immigration enforcement has left many residents on edge and
  grappling with how to go about their lives in a city that no longer feels
  safe. The return to school for most public schools on Monday has cast that in
  sharp relief. The White House said on Friday that 719 people had been arrested
  since the start of the federal crackdown, with many hundreds of them
  immigrants in the country without legal documents. On the ground, that has
  looked like federal agents patrolling the streets for undocumented immigrants,
  setting up checkpoints at busy intersections, stopping delivery drivers and
  pedestrians, and detaining immigrants at their places of work. The crackdown
  has especially been affecting parents and caregivers as the new school year
  begins. Parents told the Guardian they were scared to send their children to
  school. Nannies are calling out or asking to be escorted to and from work.
  Daycares are having to implement new safety precautions. Once off limits for
  immigration enforcement and arrests, schools and daycares feel as if they are
  no longer safe for employees and for children, many Washingtonians said.
  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not respond to the Guardian’s
  request for comment. Last week, Ice’s acting director, Todd Lyons, told NBC
  that Washington parents should not expect to see Ice officers at schools on
  the first day Monday, but that they may come to school campuses in the future.
  “It’s gotten to the point where people are scared to be out and about,” said
  Amie Santos, a Washington resident who lives near the daycare. “Nothing about
  this is making DC safer.” *** For many Washingtonians, the potential targeting
  of people and institutions that care for small children has been especially
  alarming. Multiple people told the Guardian they were struggling with
  childcare, as so many who work as nannies or in childcare centers are
  immigrants. Claire, a mom who asked not to use her real name due to fears
  about her undocumented nanny, said her caretaker called out of work last week
  with short notice, saying she was concerned about reports of increased police
  and arrests. “She said there’s a very heavy police presence and she’s hearing
  all of these stories from other nannies and from friends and acquaintances
  that there are all of these checkpoints,” Claire said. “She said she and her
  husband are both staying home and not coming into work, either of them.”
  Claire gave her the week off and is working to figure out options to make her
  more comfortable to return to work this week, including offering to pick her
  up from her home. The nanny, who has been in the country for almost three
  decades, has a teenage child, and “she is so concerned about deportation –
  that something could happen to her and her husband – that she has asked if we
  would take care of her child if that were to happen”, Claire said. Other
  parents said they were driving their children to the neighboring state of
  Maryland to meet their nannies who live there, or that their nannies have been
  staying inside rather than venturing outside, or driving throughout the city
  rather than walking. In a neighborhood parents group, a mom on Tuesday shared
  a document template for parents to fill out and give to their nannies as they
  escort their children around the city. “In the event that [NANNY’S NAME] is
  detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) or any other law
  enforcement authority, this letter affirms that [CHILD’S NAME] is my child and
  should be immediately returned to me, [HER/HIS MOTHER/FATHER/PARENT] and legal
  guardian,” the template reads. “Under no circumstance should [CHILD’S NAME] be
  taken into government custody or placed in foster care.” *** With the new
  school year beginning in the middle of Trump’s federal takeover, parents are
  also concerned about what might be happening at schools. Sebastien Durand, the
  director of facilities at a public charter school in north-west DC whose role
  involves student safety, said the school had engaged with families this week
  before the school year begins. “It was made clear to us that they are all
  extremely scared,” he said. “Quite a bit of them were actually asking if we
  can go back to a pandemic era-type of school where they didn’t have to come to
  school and we had to provide something remote.” He said he explained to them
  that legally they can’t do that, but the school decided to use its own funds
  to run buses from the closest Metro station to the campus for at least the
  next two weeks. The school is concerned about attendance, he said, especially
  with rates still lower than desired since the pandemic. For children that have
  already started the school year, the first week has been fraught. Santos’s
  five-year-old son started kindergarten on Monday at school in north-west DC.
  On the second day of school, there were unmarked police cars with agents who
  appeared to be in tactical gear parked in front of the school, she said. That
  evening, parents were told the school was enhancing security measures and all
  students, parents and caretakers would be required to wear colored lanyards
  with photo identification to enter school grounds. The school will also be
  running a bus for students and caretakers from the Metro to the parking lot.
  “As you can imagine, it’s been hard,” Santos said. “We had to talk to our son
  about what was going on, why there was increased security, the importance of
  kindness, that not everybody feels safe and welcome. “With kids going back to
  school, there are intimidation factors at play,” she added, “and it’s creating
  an aggressive environment that I don’t think is conducive to learning or to
  children.”
