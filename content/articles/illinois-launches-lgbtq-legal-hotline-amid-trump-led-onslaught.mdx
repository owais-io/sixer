  Illinois has launched a first-of-its-kind legal hotline that provides
  resources for the LGBTQ+ community at a time when they face increased
  hostility across the US. Legal services in the US can be costly and
  inaccessible, and the creation of the phone line is aimed at helping LGBTQ+
  people access them despite other federal cuts that may affect them. “This
  hotline is a groundbreaking opportunity to receive free, affirming legal
  support from the comfort and safety of home,” said Joshua Gavel, the executive
  director of United Pride, an LGBTQ+ resource center in Illinois. “It sends a
  powerful message,” Gavel added, “that Illinois values and protects its LGBTQ+
  residents, and we are proud to see our state leading the way.” The phone line,
  called IL Pride Connect, was launched by the Democratic governor of Illinois,
  JB Pritzker. It includes a digital resource hub, referrals to affirming legal
  and community services, and advocacy tools. The hotline is staffed Monday
  through Thursday and can assist people with tasks such as accessing healthcare
  and changing their name and gender marker on documents. “In Illinois, we are
  fighting ignorance with information and cruelty with compassion,” Pritzker
  said at the launch. “IL Pride Connect will inform individuals of their rights
  and connect them to health and social services support – making us the only
  state in the nation to provide free legal advice and advocacy tools to protect
  the LGBTQ community.” Pritzker’s installation of the phone hotline comes as
  other US states and organizations have experienced rollbacks to LGBTQ+
  initiatives. Earlier this month, Trump shut down an LGBTQ+ youth suicide
  lifeline. Under the 988 national hotline, trained counsellors answered 1.5m
  online chats, calls or texts from queer youth in crisis. The 988 general
  hotline remains in place, and specialized services for veterans are still
  available. The administration has also axed more than $125m in LGBTQ+ health
  funding, upending the research field, increasingly targeted books that cover
  topics such as queer identities or sexuality, and ruled, among other things,
  that trans athletes cannot compete in women’s sports. “We applaud Illinois
  leaders for launching the IL Pride Connect Hotline,” said Carolyn Wahlskog,
  director of operations and programs at Youth Outlook in Illinois. “In a moment
  when rights can feel like a moving target, the hotline provides something
  vital: clear, trusted guidance. We’re grateful to have this resource available
  for the LGBTQ+ youth and families we serve.” The hotline was supported by a
  $250,000 investment from the state and $100,000 in philanthropic support for
  legal staffing and statewide accessibility. It was developed with the guidance
  of LGBTQ+ organizations and legal advocates across the state, and will be
  directed by the Legal Council for Health Justice. “In today’s political
  climate, LGBTQIA+ Illinoisans need real, practical support. IL Pride Connect
  offers exactly that: a statewide hub and live legal hotline staffed by people
  who understand, who care and who are ready to help,” said Julie Justicz,
  executive director of the Legal Council for Health Justice, when the
  initiative was launched. For Precious Brady-Davis, who serves as a
  commissioner at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago
  and is the first Black out trans woman to be elected to public office in Cook
  county history, said that the moment offered hope. “I grew up in Nebraska,
  where I didn’t see many people who looked like me. Coming out in that
  environment was isolating, and being told I didn’t belong made the journey
  even lonelier,” Brady-Davis said. “From time to time, little glimmers of hope
  reminded me I was worthy of love and had a place in this world. Those rare
  moments are why I fight for others to experience not just glimpses, but
  lasting belonging.”
