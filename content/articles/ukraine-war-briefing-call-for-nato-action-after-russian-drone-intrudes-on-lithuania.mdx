  Lithuania

  Lithuania has called for Nato help to boost its air defences after Russian
  military drones repeatedly violated its airspace. “Last Monday, a Russian
  military drone violated Lithuanian airspace,” said Kęstutis Budrys, the
  foreign minister in Vilnius. “This marks the second such incident in less than
  a month. Similar airspace violations have also been reported recently by other
  allies.” Budrys added that he and the defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, had
  asked the Nato secretary general for “immediate measures to enhance air
  defence capabilities in Lithuania and accelerate the full implementation of
  the rotational air defence model. Air defence is vital to allied security.
  Securing Nato’s eastern flank must remain a top priority for the alliance.”
  Amid the nuclear row between Donald Trump and Dmitry Medvedev, the Kremlin has
  moved to play down the latter’s role in Russian decision-making, the Institute
  for the Study of War has said. The thinktank said Medvedev was subsequently
  being portrayed as having a “different assessment” from Putin on nuclear
  issues. An ISW assessment said: “The Kremlin regularly uses Medvedev to
  introduce nuclear threats into the Russian and international information
  spaces.” Medvedev, a high-ranked official who was once prime minister of
  Russia, as well as a proxy for Putin in the presidency, accused Trump of
  taking “a step towards war” by tightening an ultimatum for Russia to seek
  peace. Trump in response said he had moved two nuclear submarines into
  position “just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than
  just that”. The ISW further assessed that “Kremlin officials utilised three
  main framings to respond to Trump’s decision to redeploy the submarines:
  posing Trump’s decision to redeploy the submarines as “emotional,” discounting
  the threat that this decision poses to Russia, and posturing Russia as a more
  responsible international actor than the United States … These official
  Russian responses ignore the Kremlin’s history of frequently using nuclear
  saber-rattling to push the west to make decisions that benefit Russia. On the
  battlefield, the ISW said that Ukrainian forces had recently advanced near
  Pokrovsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture since at least July
  2024. Russian forces recently advanced near Kupyansk, Siversk, Toretsk, and
  Velykomykhailivka, the institute said. Russian claimed on Tuesday to have
  captured the village of Sichneve in east-central Dnipropetrovsk region. The
  Reuters news agency, which carried the claim, said it could not independently
  confirm it. Donald Trump has said he will make a decision on whether to
  sanction countries that purchase Russian oil after a meeting with Russian
  officials scheduled for Wednesday. Steve Witkoff – real estate promoter,
  friend of Trump and officially his Russia envoy – arrived in Moscow on
  Wednesday morning to meet with Russian leadership. A Bloomberg report
  suggested that Putin might agree to a ceasefire in terms of airstrikes but not
  on the ground. Also on Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Trump’s
  administration is considering additional sanctions on Russia’s “shadow fleet”
  of oil tankers that illicitly move Russian oil. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s
  president, said on Tuesday he’d had a “productive” conversation with Trump
  about ending the war, sanctions on Russia and the finalisation of a US-Ukraine
  drone deal. Ukraine, he said, had long supported US proposals for an immediate
  ceasefire and had proposed a number of formats to implement a halt to the
  fighting. “We have spoken with and proposed to Russia quiet in the skies, no
  missile and drone attacks and specifically no attacks on civilian
  infrastructure or on the energy sector. All of this has been violated by the
  Russians and in a very cynical fashion.” The $300m superyacht of a sanctioned
  Russian billionaire is being auctioned off. The 348-foot (106-metre) Amadea
  was seized in Fiji in April 2022 from its former owner, Suleiman Kerimov, and
  is berthed in San Diego California. The auction is being held by National
  Maritime Services, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, company. Sealed bids are being
  accepted until 10 September subject to a $10m deposit. The US Congress has
  passed legislation allowing the sale of seized Russian assets to fund
  humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.
