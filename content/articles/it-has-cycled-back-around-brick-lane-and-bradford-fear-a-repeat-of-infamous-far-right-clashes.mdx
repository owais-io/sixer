  far-right clashes

  The shoppers and shopkeepers of White Abbey Road in Bradford well remember a
  time almost 25 years ago when the street was engulfed in flames after a
  protest march against the National Front turned violent. On east London’s
  Brick Lane, the British-Bangladeshi population remember the invisible lines
  they could not cross without being set upon by the far right. For both
  communities, whose showdowns with racist groups came in different decades, the
  atmosphere in the UK today feels worryingly familiar, with far-right sentiment
  on the rise, stoked by politicians. “It feels like it has cycled back around,”
  says Mohsin Shuja, 42, who works in a jewellery shop on White Abbey Road. As a
  teenager during the 2001 Bradford riots, he was involved in protests against
  the far right that descended into clashes with police. This weekend will see
  demonstrations outside hotels housing asylum seekers across the country – some
  organised by far-right groups – with counter-protests also planned. For people
  in Bradford and London’s East End, there are fears history could start to
  repeat itself in parts of the UK. Shuja does not predict trouble in Bradford,
  but feels other parts of the country could see unrest. “Not so much in
  Bradford – back then they stirred up something and that got dealt with, but
  since then I think cohesion is good. In other places though, definitely,
  especially smaller communities. They won’t be able to defend themselves.” The
  riots in Bradford in 2001 were preceded by weeks of warnings that the far
  right was planning to target the city’s south Asian population and incidents
  of violence in other northern cities. The riot itself was triggered by reports
  of the stabbing of an Asian man. In Brick Lane, similarly, the “battle of
  Brick Lane” in 1978 was triggered by the murder of the Bangladeshi textile
  worker Altab Ali at a time when the National Front regularly targeted the
  local British-Bangladeshi population. Mohammed Abdul Sobhan, 69, a retired
  restaurateur who also goes by the name Gedhu, was involved in fighting the
  National Front during the 1970s and 80s, when the group would regularly attack
  Bangladeshis in east London. He says young people would station themselves on
  corners along Brick Lane ready to push back against any attacks. They had
  little trust in police protection and he thinks their resistance is why the
  area is now safe for everybody. “When I came there were teddy boys, then
  people got fed up with teddy boys so they produced skinheads, National Front,
  EDL. It’s the same group, just a different name. It’s a kind of disease,” he
  says. “We can come out and stop them but they will come back two months
  later.” While decades have passed since the height of far-right violence in
  both east London and Bradford, the areas have not been able to completely move
  on. In the early 2010s, both were the targets of major rallies by the English
  Defence League (EDL) and there were concerns they could be hit by the unrest
  last summer precipitated by the Southport murders. Fatima Mahmood was a baby
  during the riots but grew up in the Manningham area of Bradford where they
  were concentrated. Shopping areas such as White Abbey Road took years to
  bounce back while other parts of the area never did. After major damage to a
  BMW garage, which had provided local jobs, it was reopened in another part of
  the city. The city is in a better place now, but Mahmood says that for its
  youth, the far right’s insistence on constantly bringing up places such as
  Bradford can leave people on edge. “People were very much wondering: are they
  going to come again? Is it going to be a repeat of the 2001 riots or before
  that in the 1960s, 70s and the 80s as well,” says Mahmood, who works in
  anti-racism and community organising at the Bradford-based Race Equality
  Network. Mohammed Amran, the Labour councillor for Bradford’s Heaton ward,
  says the city has made major strides in mending relations between communities
  but that he is worried about the tone of political rhetoric. “It was scary –
  there was fire, smoke, bricks flying around,” says Amran of the 2001 riots in
  the city, as he drives along Oak Lane, pointing out the flashpoints during the
  riots. “Nationally, the language [politicians] use, it worries people,” he
  says. He points to rhetoric around grooming gangs and asylum seekers or
  accusations that Turkish barbers are fronts for money laundering which create
  hostility towards minority groups. The Race Equality Network argues that the
  cycle of far-right hatred against minority communities happens because
  structural issues are not being dealt with. Mahmood says the government needs
  do to more than just encouraging community-level projects to bring groups
  together, especially when ministers are themselves responsible for what she
  described as anti-migrant rhetoric. “Throwing pots of money at community
  organisations and expecting them to intervene and solve these problems is not
  the way to go. We’re more keen on the government coming [making policy] that
  is rooted in compassion, rather than in furthering hostile ideas,” she says.
