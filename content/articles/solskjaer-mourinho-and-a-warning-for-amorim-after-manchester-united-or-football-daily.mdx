  UNITED WE FALL The modern football manager might wear classic Reeboks, or
  knackered Converse, or trackie bottoms tucked in socks but, to continue
  paraphrasing the Arctic Monkeys song, there ain’t no romance in our game no
  more. Nothing endures. The average managerial tenure tends to last between 18
  months and two years. For Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Besiktas, it was a little
  more than seven months; José Mourinho got 14 at Fenerbahce. And so the pair,
  intrinsically linked by their sequential spells at Manchester United, find
  themselves on similar paths again, their sackings from Turkish nearly-clubs
  coming within hours of each other this week. Both have been caught in the meat
  grinder of Uefa’s endless European qualifiers. Solskjær’s brave Besiktas boys
  were downed by Ineos-owned Lausanne in the Tin Pot playoffs on Thursday night.
  A day earlier, Mourinho’s men were ousted by Benfica in the Bigger Cup
  equivalent. It feels rather timely that these two former United bosses should
  be chucked through the door marked Do One just as the latest man to suffer the
  Old Trafford meme factory is put to his limits. Ruben Amorim will rue the day
  he popped into Sports Direct to buy that magnetic tactics board, for it was
  instantly imbibed into the internet’s collection of looped two-second videos
  for merciless and eternal social media use. Amorim, the sweet-talking
  dogmatist whose principled management was the exact reason for his appointment
  at United, is now being viewed with ridicule and derision, just as Solskjær
  and Mourinho were before him. It comes for everyone. Solskjær was a club
  legend who ended his reign by crying on MUTV; Mourinho was the managerial
  great living miserably in a hotel room after alienating his squad. The
  scythe’s swing is remorseless. The United fanbase has always been divided
  regarding how to view the aforementioned duo. Without question, they occupy
  the top two in the post-Ferguson cartel of managers, albeit Erik ten Hag and
  Louis van Gaal won domestic cups where Solskjær won none. But the Norwegian
  came second, produced fluent football and endeared himself to United
  supporters. The romanticists loved him, how he paid lip service to the club’s
  history by playing counterattacking football and refusing to use Sir Alex
  Ferguson’s old parking space. It is widely agreed that sacking Solskjær in
  November 2022 was a premature move by United, given they had no idea how to
  replace him. There are now even some whispers among supporters about bringing
  him back. You know the drill: an interim spell, 4-2-3-1 and good vibes. Isn’t
  that what football is about? Oh no, sorry, romance is dead … Instead United
  and Amorim plough on together. The dreaded vote of confidence. The rigid
  formation. Mason Mount at left wing-back. The apologies from Diogo Dalot after
  another defensive disasterclass. There are rumours Amorim may be considering
  walking away from it all, shunning a hefty payoff, believing there is a desert
  island somewhere for him to sit on and fiddle with his laminated tactics
  tablet forever more. As Solskjær and Mourinho prove, however, the most likely
  future awaiting Amorim is a bleak spell managing Trabzonspor, eventually
  getting the bullet in late August 2028 for a meek Big Vase qualifying defeat
  to Lens. Be warned, Ruben. QUOTE OF THE DAY I used this word unintentionally,
  just to make it very clear. I had no intention, there was no message, there
  was no hidden agenda. I fully understand it’s my responsibility that I created
  these headlines. I’m sorry for the upset and for the headlines that I created.
  I’m experienced enough, I should have known better and should have done
  better. I thought I have a little bit more credit with you guys, that I do all
  this in my second language. I did it on the morning after a loss and not a lot
  of sleep. I did it in a live interview and I used the wrong word. I made
  straight away contact with him, of course and I got in touch with him straight
  away. Jude’s focus is now in his rehabilitation” – a contrite Thomas Tuchel
  explains how and why in June he used the word “repulsive” to describe some of
  Jude Bellingham’s on-field antics. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS So José pointedly
  said that after Galatasaray, he wanted to manage a club at the bottom of the
  Premier League, where he wouldn’t have deal with UEFA … Taxi for Potter,
  anyone? – Declan Hackett. Amorim on the brink, Mourinho sacked. We can all see
  how this pans out, but I bet David Squires is properly happy” – Kev, Uffculme.
  My mate in Newcastle congratulated my team on knocking ‘the vile Mackems’ out
  of the Carabao Cup (but we were a mere two divisions below them so it won’t
  have registered with you guys and it is likely to be a league game next season
  anyway) and then went on to comment on his team losing at home to Liverpool.
  ‘Always disliked them, but it’s now visceral with all this Judas Isakariot
  business. T-shirts with his picture on are on sale outside the ground with a
  free box of matches” – Richard Askham. As the transfer window draws to a
  close, Zian Flemming’s permanent switch to Burnley for a reported £7m fee may
  not have caused the same headlines as Gyökeres or Eze, but let me tell you
  that Zian is worth his weight in gold! Quite literally, with Flemming
  reportedly weighing in at 84kg and gold prices hovering around $3,466 per Troy
  ounce, he would be worth £7m in gold. To use the old football idiom and
  question whether he is worth his weight in goals however is quite another
  matter … “ – Sam from London. Fulham suit on the phone with Shakhtar suit: “We
  need to talk about Kevin” – ‎Lean Ka-Min. JJ Zucal – deservedly – won
  Thursday’s letter o’ the day. But Tom Dowler deserves a special award for
  actually making me laugh out loud while reading Football Daily – Mark Waters.
  If you have any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s
  winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Richard Askham. Terms and
  conditions for our competitions, when we run them, can be viewed here. 
  RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry
  Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and
  Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered football punditry at Troxy in
  London. The pod will also be livestreamed globally. Book now.  This is an
