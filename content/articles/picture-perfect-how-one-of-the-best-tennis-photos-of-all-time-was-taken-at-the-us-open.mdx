  the US Open

  Of the scores of photographers from across the globe snapping thousands upon
  thousands of photos at this year’s US Open, one image has stood out above all
  the others so far at the tennis grand slam in New York. A slight imbalance
  from seventh-seed Jasmine Paolini and a relentlessly steady hand allowed
  photographer Ray Giubilo to nail a one-in-a-million shot at Flushing Meadows
  this week. Paolini hailed it as “maybe the picture of the year”, but the
  whimsical image taken during the Italian player’s first-round encounter with
  Australia’s Destanee Aiava could lay claim to an even grander title than that.
  Tennis photography isn’t known for its sense of humour. The images are often
  clean, sharp and intense but rarely are they hilarious. A nanosecond later or
  before would have rendered a completely different frame and missed the pure
  comedic value behind Giubilo’s image. Half terrifying and half sublime, the
  image was captured by complete fluke. Giubilo told the Guardian he had “been
  waiting for a long time for something like this”, and that he knew what a
  great image he had taken the moment he saw it on the back of his Nikon Z9. The
  only way Giubilo was able to line up the shot so perfectly was due to Paolini
  being off balance when she finished her forehand stroke. “She just moved the
  racket back in a way that she normally doesn’t do,” he said. When he attempted
  to capture the same image the following night, frame after frame it could not
  be replicated. Paolini was so enamoured of the shot, she singled out Giubilo
  the next time she was on court for a second-round match to express her
  admiration. “Tonight after the match when she won, I was sitting underneath
  her box and she ran towards the box, smiling as she always does, and I thought
  she was going to go and hug her coach. But she came to me instead and she gave
  me five and said, ‘Great photo.’” Before becoming a professional photographer
  Giubilo was an agent for a tennis clothing company in Australia. His passion
  was always photography, and with the help of people such as John Newcombe and
  John Alexander he moved into photographing local matches. Thirty-seven years
  later he spends seven months a year travelling the tennis circuit, shooting up
  to 20 matches a day over gruelling 14-hour shifts. Patience, creative flair
  and impeccable technical ability is what defines amazing sports photographers;
  sitting still for hours while watching match after match, all while remaining
  laser focused on each hit. “You have to be patient, you have to be fast, you
  have to be fit,” he said.
