  British tax authorities have filed a winding-up petition against Liberty
  Steel’s business making pipes in northern England in the latest sign of the
  pressure on the metals empire controlled by the tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. Court
  filings list HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) as the petitioner in a winding-up
  petition against Liberty Pipes (Hartlepool) that was filed on Tuesday. The
  listing suggests that the petition relates to an unpaid VAT bill. However,
  Liberty said everything the business owed to HMRC had been settled and that
  there was no threat to the Hartlepool operations, which continue to operate
  and employ 178 people. A spokesperson said: “Liberty Pipes Hartlepool has no
  outstanding payments due to HMRC. We are in touch with HMRC to have the
  petition removed.” An HMRC spokesperson said: “We take a supportive approach
  to dealing with customers who have tax debts and only file winding-up
  petitions once we’ve exhausted all other options, in order to protect
  taxpayers’ money.” The petition is the latest sign of the increasing financial
  pressure on Liberty Steel, which is a key part of Gupta’s GFG Alliance, an
  informal group of metals and energy companies stretching from Australia via
  Singapore and Romania to northern England. Gupta’s companies have been in
  trouble since the 2021 failure of Greensill Capital, which collapsed after
  lending GFG about $5bn (£3.7bn). Gupta has been engaged in long-running talks
  with the administrators of Greensill, who are trying to recover the money. GFG
  has been under investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office since 2021 in
  relation to the Greensill financing. The company and Gupta have denied
  wrongdoing. Gupta is also being prosecuted by Companies House over the failure
  to file accounts for more than 70 UK businesses – including those of Liberty
  Pipes (Hartlepool). He has pleaded not guilty. Other key parts of Liberty
  Steel’s operations in the UK face the prospect of closure unless they can find
  new funding. An insolvency hearing postponed to later this month will decide
  the fate of Speciality Steel UK, which employs 1,450 people in South Yorkshire
  at an electric arc furnace at Rotherham, and another factory in Stocksbridge,
  near Sheffield. The Guardian revealed last month that ministers are
  considering stepping in to prevent those sites from closing should they fall
  into administration. The Hartlepool factory in County Durham has the capacity
  to make 250,000 tonnes of pipes a year to be used by oil and gas pipelines as
  well as structural hollow sections for buildings. However, Liberty Steel’s
  operations are likely to have been disrupted by difficulties in other parts of
  the business as it has previously relied on plate steel sourced from Liberty
  Dalzell, a plate mill in Motherwell, near Edinburgh. The Guardian revealed in
  May that Dalzell had not produced any products since July 2024. The last
  accounts filed for the Hartlepool company, for the year to March 2020, showed
  a small profit. The accounts also showed that despite the profit, the company
  had net liabilities of £4.7m and suggested Liberty Steel was reliant on its
  Singapore-incorporated parent company, Liberty House Group, to keep operating.
  A source close to the company denied that it was in financial difficulty and
  blamed “administrative errors” at HMRC. They added it was currently working on
  a North Sea carbon-capture pipeline.
