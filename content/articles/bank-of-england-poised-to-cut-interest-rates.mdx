  The Bank of England is poised to cut interest rates on Thursday despite a
  growing divide between its policymakers over the dangers to the economy from
  high inflation and rising unemployment. In a development that will ease
  pressure on households and businesses, City forecasters expect the central
  bank to announce a quarter-point cut, its fifth rate reduction in a year.
  Financial markets predict an almost 100% chance of a quarter-point cut from
  4.25%, the same as the last reduction in May. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves,
  will welcome the cut as Labour comes under pressure over its economic
  management and growing questions about potential tax rises at her autumn
  budget. Ministers have sought to claim credit for the Bank reducing its base
  rate four times since August last year, arguing that it had been able to do so
  only after Labour had worked to “restore stability to the economy”. Publishing
  research before the rate decision at midday on Thursday, the party said a
  family buying a typical home was now paying almost £1,000 a year less on their
  mortgage than in July 2024, when the Conservatives left office. Figures from
  the property website Rightmove showed that a typical first-time buyer’s
  mortgage payment was now almost £100 a month less than a year earlier.
  However, a fifth rate cut will highlight the dangers facing the economy amid a
  worsening slowdown, as households and businesses grapple with tax rises,
  stubborn inflation, and global uncertainty created by Donald Trump’s tariff
  war. Analysts expect the vote on rates from the Bank’s nine-strong monetary
  policy committee to be split, exposing tensions at the heart of Threadneedle
  Street over the best course of action to keep fast-rising consumer prices in
  check while also safeguarding jobs and growth. City investors are predicting a
  three-way split, with the external economists Alan Taylor and Swati Dhingra
  favouring a bigger, half-point cut amid concern about rising job losses. Most
  of the MPC members, including the governor, Andrew Bailey, are expected to
  vote for a quarter-point reduction. Huw Pill, the Bank’s chief economist,
  could split from his colleagues to join the external economist Catherine Mann
  in voting to keep rates unchanged owing to concerns that inflationary
  pressures are mounting. Analysts believe that divisions have become more
  entrenched since the Bank last produced economic forecasts in May.
  Threadneedle Street will update its outlook on Thursday. Michael Saunders, a
  former MPC member who is now at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said the
  committee’s split was understandable. “You have weak growth, rising
  unemployment and inflation well above target; those signals go in opposite
  directions [for a rate decision],” he said. “Different people will put
  different weights on them. It is not sign that they are more argumentative
  than other committees [in the past], just that they face a greater disparity
  between growth, unemployment and inflation.” Interest rate cuts support
  economic growth by lowering borrowing costs for businesses and households.
  However, bolstering economic activity can stoke inflationary pressures.
  “Monetary policy remains quite tight. Fiscal policy is tightening, and the
  budget may include further tax hikes later this year. Trade policy uncertainty
  remains high, deterring investment and hiring.” China diverting cheap exports
  from the US to the UK during Trump’s tariff war could also reinforce downward
  pressure on inflation, he added. Labour has come under pressure from business
  leaders blaming Britain’s recent economic weakness on Reeves raising
  employment taxes in her first autumn budget, which firms warned would force
  them to cut jobs and put up prices. Official figures show unemployment has
  crept higher in recent months, while the economy shrank in April and May.
  Inflation has risen by more than expected, reaching 3.6% in June –
  significantly above the Bank’s 2% target. Business surveys this week have
  shown a slowdown in the service sector and a collapse in construction output.
  Labour said cheaper mortgage rates available today – with the average two-year
  fixed rate falling to 4.52% – had saved borrowers £81.69 on average each
  month. The Treasury minister James Murray said: “Labour’s urgent task when we
  took office was to restore stability to the economy after 14 years of Tory
  failure. Since we came into office, rates have been cut four times, and that’s
  putting more pounds in the pocket of homeowners through cheaper mortgages.”
