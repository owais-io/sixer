  What’s the problem? My mistletoe cactus (Rhipsalis) thrived for more than five
  years, but recently started to brown, with strands falling off. I repotted it
  into a slightly larger pot with no drainage holes and a layer of gravel at the
  bottom, but it continues to decline despite weekly watering. How can I save my
  plant? Diagnosis Your mistletoe cactus probably isn’t getting sufficient
  hydration. Cautious watering can lead to soil that is superficially damp but
  remains dry at a deeper level. This often manifests as browning stems,
  shrivelling and segments dropping off as the plant becomes stressed due to a
  lack of moisture at the roots. Prescription Repot into a pot with drainage
  holes, or use a nursery pot inside the decorative pot. Use compost
  specifically designed for succulents or cacti. After repotting, give it a
  thorough watering until water flows from the drainage holes. Then, let it dry
  out somewhat between waterings, typically every one to two weeks. Mistletoe
  cacti thrive on consistent moisture but detest waterlogged conditions, so good
  drainage is essential. Prevention Ensure that pots used for succulents and
  cacti have sufficient drainage holes. Regularly checking soil moisture by
  touching the soil a few centimetres down helps you accurately judge watering
  needs. Got a plant dilemma? Email saturday@theguardian.com with ‘Houseplant
