  ‘Stevie Wonder really stirred something in me’: Melanie Blatt’s honest
  playlist

  The first song I fell in love with I remember listening to Songs in the Key of
  Life by Stevie Wonder from my dad’s record collection. Have a Talk With God
  really stirred something in me. The first single I bought At Our Price on
  Finchley Road in north London, I discovered that instead of buying the
  seven-inch single of Janet Jackson’s What Have You Done for Me Lately, you
  could buy the 12-inch for £1 more and you’d get more songs. But when I got
  home, I was disappointed to find that they were all remixes of the same song.
  The song I do at karaoke Buffalo Stance by Neneh Cherry. I can do the rap
  bits, the singing bits and all the little bits in between. The song I
  inexplicably know every lyric to Certainly not my own! There something in my
  brain that doesn’t work when it comes to remembering lyrics. It’s not just now
  I’m 50 – it’s been going on for years. One of my fans comes to gigs with
  little pieces of cardboard with the lyrics on them, just to help me. The best
  song to play at a party The best songs are not necessarily what everybody else
  thinks. I’d always go for a big classic hip-hop tune, like Nothin’ by NORE.
  The best song to have sex to Nothing. I need to concentrate! The song I
  secretly like, but tell everyone I hate My sister and I used to listen to E
  for Electro by Hi_Tack and Johnny Crockett on repeat. We hadn’t listened to it
  for 10 years and listened to it the other day in the car and still loved it.
  So it’s back on the playlist. The song that gets me up in the morning Worries
  by LZee, Toddla T and Naomi Cohen always gets me going. The song that changed
  my life Never Ever [by All Saints] was our first No 1. From there, we
  travelled the world and bought houses. So that song. Plus, the All Saints
  baggy trousers look is back in fashion. The song I want played at my funeral I
  remember when I first watched Under the Cherry Moon, Prince’s follow-up movie
  to Purple Rain, and hearing Sometimes It Snows in April and finding it so
  heartbreaking. I want people to cry at my funeral. So chuck that on. Melanie
  Blatt has partnered with National Rail to create a series of audio guides to
  200 locations.
