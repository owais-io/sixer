  The next mass protest against the ban on Palestine Action will aim to be twice
  the size of the last, organisers have said, as they increase pressure on the
  government to lift its proscription. Last Saturday’s protest in Parliament
  Square was predicated on 500 people signing up but the next one, announced on
  Wednesday for 6 September in London, is conditional on 1,000 people agreeing
  to take part. Defend Our Juries, the pressure group behind the protests
  opposing the proscription of Palestine Action, said it believed a turnout of
  1,000 would be enough to get the ban lifted. A total of 532 people were
  arrested at Saturday’s demonstration, all but 10 under section 13 of the
  Terrorism Act for carrying placards saying: “I oppose genocide, I support
  Palestine Action.” The number of people arrested for peaceful protests, their
  age profile – half of those arrested were 60 or older – and the strain it is
  putting on the criminal justice system have led many to question the ban. A
  Defend Our Juries spokesperson said: “With all the real challenges facing the
  country, it’s crazy that the Labour government has generated a political
  crisis over people quietly holding cardboard signs against genocide in
  Parliament Square. This won’t be forgotten.” After the weekend’s arrests,
  Downing Street and Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said the protesters did
  not know about the group’s violent tendencies. In response, Defend Our Juries
  and the Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori pointed to intelligence
  assessments released in Ammori’s continuing legal battle fighting proscription
  that they said contradicted the claims. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre
  (JTAC), a government body based within MI5, produced a report on 7 March that
  said the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically
  resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty
  vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it added. A separate assessment by the
  Proscription Review Group (PRG) said a ban would be “relatively novel” as
  “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis
  that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action
  involving serious damage to property”. Nevertheless, the JTAC and PRG
  recommended proscription. References to violence by Downing Street and Cooper
  are understood to refer to an allegation of assault against a single person
  associated with Palestine Action, which they deny and which relates to live
  proceedings so cannot be discussed fully because of the risk of contempt of
  court. The Defend Our Juries spokesperson suggested that even if the
  allegation were proved, that would not make the whole organisation terrorist,
  adding: “When the Labour MP Mike Amesbury assaulted his constituent, no one
  suggested that that made the Labour party a terrorist organisation.” They
  continued: “The public response to our protests has been overwhelming. Despite
  (or because of) the legal risks, the government has turned an arrest for
  terrorism into a badge of honour for resistance to genocide. We have been
  inundated with offers of support from all quarters … The protest will go ahead
  as long as at least 1,000 people commit to taking part. That could well be
  enough for the ban to be lifted. If 5,000 people show up, we’re certain the
  ban will be gone, and with it, most likely, Yvette Cooper.” The former cabinet
  minister Peter Hain has said the UK government is “digging itself into a hole”
  over Palestine Action and that fellow Labour peers and MPs were regretting
  voting to ban the group. Lord Hain, who opposed proscription and was a leader
  of the anti-apartheid movement, said equating the likes of retired magistrates
  and serving doctors with al-Qaida was “absolutely wrong” and would “end in
  tears for the government”.
