  The big bratwurst brawl: why is this simple sausage so sizzlingly
  controversial?

  Name: Bratwurst. Age: It depends. Appearance: Again, it depends. Depends on
  what? On where you are: the Coburger bratwurst, for example, is longer than
  those of other regions – measuring up to 25cm (10in). You know what they say:
  size matters. It’s not the only thing that matters in Thuringia. They have
  their own bratwurst museum celebrating their distinctively average 15- to
  20cm-long sausages. But what about age? How old, exactly, is the bratwurst?
  That’s hotly contested: an early written reference is found in a 1404 bill for
  bratwurst casings, levied in the Thuringian city of Arnstadt. So bratwurst was
  invented in Thuringia some time before 1404. Not so fast. The world’s oldest
  sausage shop – the Wurstkuchl in Regensburg, Bavaria – claims to have been
  selling bratwurst since at least 1378. So bratwurst was invented in Bavaria in
  the late-14th century, or thereabouts? Wait. Some years ago the Bavarians
  unearthed their own documentation: a decree from Nuremberg council declaring
  that only pork loin could be used to make sausage – from 1313. So the
  bratwurst was legislated into being in Nuremberg in 1313? Well, the Thuringian
  version of bratwurst has protected geographical status under EU law. So it’s
  the real thing, and therefore takes precedent? It’s messy, because the
  Nuremberg version – which is only 8cm long – also has protected status. Eight
  centimetres – you call that a sausage! I’m guessing Nuremberg wins though, as
  it has the older sausage. Well, there’s a new document in town: researchers in
  the Thuringian capital of Erfurt recently discovered a reference to a
  brathütte (a meat-roasting stand) doing business on the Merchants’ Bridge in –
  get this – 1269. Rubbish. That’s more than 40 years before Bavaria’s oldest
  claim – history must be rewritten! A meat-roasting hut is not evidence of
  someone inventing bratwurst. That’s certainly the view over at the Bratwurst
  Museum. “I consider it very bold to conclude from this that bratwursts were
  cooked there,” says managing director Thomas Mauer. To be honest, I can’t
  believe I’m even pretending to have an opinion. Mauer also insists the 1404
  document contains the earliest unambiguous reference to bratwurst. I don’t
  care. But this debate has been raging for 25 years. It can carry on for
  another 25, as long as it’s without me. Aren’t you concerned about the decline
  in Bratwurst consumption, which has fallen to just 2.4kg per German per annum?
  I am not. Fair enough. Do say: “Despite its obscure origins, the bratwurst
  deserves to be celebrated as a product that’s truly German and deeply
  ancient.” Don’t say: “Not these though. These were made this morning.”
