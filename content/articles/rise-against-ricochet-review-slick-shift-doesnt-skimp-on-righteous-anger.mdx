  Rise Against are not the first punk band to embrace the trappings of arena
  rock, but few of their forerunners can say they moved between those opposing
  states with the confidence and style displayed here. Having spent two decades
  retrofitting the breakneck melodic hardcore of their early work with
  rafter-shaking hooks and gleaming production, the Chicago veterans’ 10th album
  is a hulking thing, its bombast and righteous anger fed by vocalist Tim
  McIlrath, who finds the middle ground between Strike Anywhere and Creedence
  Clearwater Revival more often than you might think possible. Working in tandem
  with producer Catherine Marks, fresh from Grammy wins for her work on
  Boygenius’s The Record, and mixer-to-the-stars Alan Moulder, they regularly
  square the circle between blood-and-guts emotion and high-sheen recording
  craft. McIlrath’s community-minded political sloganeering finds the perfect
  vehicle in the wrecking-ball sonics of Sink Like a Stone and Nod, an opener
  that taps into the double-time urgency of their career-shaping 2006 track
  Prayer of the Refugee. There is a very fine line between going big and
  becoming broad, though, and Rise Against do occasionally cross it. I Want It
  All’s stomping garage rock fails to rise much above pastiche, and power ballad
  Gold Long Gone is too slick for its own good. They pull it back thanks to
  moments such as Black Crown. A collaboration with Manchester Orchestra’s Andy
  Hull, it’s a gut-wrenching warning against apathy as the world burns that also
  happens to sound like a million bucks.
