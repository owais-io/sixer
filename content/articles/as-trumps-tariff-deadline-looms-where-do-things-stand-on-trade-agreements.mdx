  The clock is ticking closer to Donald Trump’s latest tariff deadline of 1
  August, and while the president has been at pains to promote the agreements
  clinched with some major trading partners, many others are facing the prospect
  of no deal and increased levies on their exports to the Unites States. Dozens
  more are caught somewhere in the middle – with no trade deal signed, but as
  yet no threat of higher tariffs. Among them are some of America’s closet
  allies and biggest trading partners, including Australia, Taiwan and New
  Zealand. After market turmoil led Trump to twice postpone the implementation
  of the higher tariffs, the president insisted on Wednesday that the 1 August
  deadline “will not be extended” any further, promising it would be “a big day
  for America.” However, Trump still faces a potential hurdle in the courts;
  hours before the new round of tariffs are due to come into effect on Friday,
  the US court of appeals for the federal circuit will hear arguments on whether
  the president even has the authority to impose the tariffs. Threatened tariffs
  For many of the countries without a deal facing the threat of crushing
  tariffs, the impasse appears to be rooted in politics as opposed to economics.
  Brazil Brazil is one of the few major economies with which the US runs a trade
  surplus – however earlier this month, Trump announced he would impose a 50%
  tariff on products sent from the country, tying the move to what he called a
  “witch-hunt” trial against its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil’s
  president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has urged the US president to avoid
  creating a “lose-lose” relationship between two of the largest economies in
  the Americas and said he did not fear publicly criticising Trump, whom he
  recently called an “emperor”. India Trump announced the US would impose a 25%
  tariff on goods from India plus an extra “penalty” for the country buying arms
  and energy from Russia amid the war in Ukraine. While saying that Delhi was a
  “friend,” Trump said the US had a “massive” trade deficit with India and
  linked its “vast” purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia to
  Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Mexico Trump has threatened to impose a 30%
  tariff on Mexican goods, accusing the country of not doing enough to curb drug
  smuggling. Mexico is the largest trading partner of the US and president
  Claudia Sheinbaum has previously said she thought an agreement could be
  reached before the 1 August deadline. Canada Canadian prime minister Mark
  Carney has said tariff negotiations would probably not conclude by 1 August –
  but Trump has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on imports not covered by the
  US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. In March, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on cars
  and auto parts imported from Canada. In June he announced a 50% tariff on
  Canadian steel and aluminium imports. The new rate would apply to all other
  goods. On Wednesday, Trump said that Canada’s decision to back statehood for
  Palestine would make it “hard for us to make a trade deal with them.” China US
  and Chinese negotiators have agreed to push back the deadline for escalating
  tariffs after talks this week failed to find a resolution across the many
  areas of dispute. China has taken an aggressive stance in response to Trump’s
  threatened border taxes, retaliating with tariffs of its own on US goods and
  blocking the sale of vital rare earth metals and components used by American
  defence and hi-tech manufacturers. Deals So far the US has completed eight
  framework deals which promise tariffs lower than the levels threatened if no
  deal was reached, but considerably higher than the rates imposed before
  Trump’s second term began – meaning US consumers may face higher prices if
  companies pass the costs. While details remain to be negotiated, many of the
  countries concerned have made considerable concessions to the US. South Korea
  Trump announced on Wednesday that the US would impose a 15% tariff on imports
  from South Korea – after negotiations that were an early test for South Korean
  President Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June after a snap election. Trump
  said South Korea had agreed to invest $350bn in the United States in projects
  selected by the US and to purchase $100bn of liquefied natural gas and other
  energy products. EU A deal was reached on Sunday that includes a baseline US
  tariff of 15%, including to Europe’s crucial automobile sector,
  pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. As part of the deal, the EU has agreed to
  purchase energy worth $750bn and make investments in the US, according to
  Trump. France’s minister for Europe, Benjamin Haddad, said on Monday the
  agreement was “unbalanced” and Germany’s BDI business federation said the
  accord would have “considerable negative repercussions.” Japan Japan’s exports
  to the US will be taxed at 15%, including automobiles, an industry accounting
  for 30% of Japanese exports to the US in 2024. Tariffs of 50% on Japanese
  steel and aluminium will continue to apply and the White House said that under
  the deal, Japan would make $550bn in investments in the US. The Philippines
  Products from the Philippines, a major exporter of hi-tech items and apparel,
  will face a 19% levy. UK British products will be subject to a 10% base rate,
  with exceptions for some industries. The UK is still negotiating exemptions
  for its steel and aluminium products from the 25% rate in force. In return,
  the UK had to open its market further to US ethanol and beef, which has caused
  concern domestically. Vietnam Vietnam reached a deal in early July with the
  US, its main export market for products including clothing and shoes. The deal
  will see its shipments subject to a 20% tariff, but a 40% tariff will be
  imposed on transshipments – goods manufactured in third countries that use
  Vietnam to circumvent steeper trade barriers. US goods will not face any
  tariffs entering Vietnam. Indonesia Indonesian exports to the US will be taxed
  at 19% and, according to Washington, nearly all US goods will be able to enter
  Indonesia tariff free. Indonesia had already made other concessions earlier in
  July, pledging to buy more US oil and industrial goods. Pakistan Pakistan –
  facing a potential 29% tariff on exports to the US – said on Thursday it had
  struck a deal that would result in lower tariffs, as well as an agreement in
  which Washington would help develop the country’s oil reserves. With Agence
