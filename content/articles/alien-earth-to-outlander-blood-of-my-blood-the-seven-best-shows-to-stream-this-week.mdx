  this week

  Pick of the week Alien: Earth It’s remarkable that it has taken so long for
  the xenomorph created by Ridley Scott in Alien to arrive on the small screen.
  But here it is courtesy of Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley. The sci-fi thriller
  is set two years before the first film and centres on the crash-landing of a
  research vessel on Earth – in the middle of a battle between two corporations:
  pushy upstarts Prodigy and the villainous Weyland-Yutani. Prodigy’s gift to
  the world is transhumanism, in which human consciousness is implanted into
  seemingly indestructible bodies. Expect that proposition to be tested by the
  arrival of extraterrestrial specimens from the doomed spacecraft. The result
  is a tense, nasty and inventive series. Disney+, from Wednesday 13 August ***
  Outlander: Blood of My Blood This prequel to Outlander boasts a similar tone:
  the kind of shortbread box kitsch that makes Mel Gibson’s Braveheart look
  subtle and understated. It tells the origin tales of Outlander’s lead
  characters Jamie Fraser and Claire Beauchamp via the romantic backstories of
  their parents. Jamie’s family history is a bloody affair, born out of
  forbidden love in the midst of a rivalry between two Highland clans. Claire’s
  involves time travel and takes place during the first world war. The show is
  as beguilingly silly as ever and good fun, as long as you don’t expect it to
  make any logical sense. MGM+ via Prime Video, out now *** Necaxa Today
  Wrexham, tomorrow the world? Eva Longoria has decided to try to revive the
  fortunes of Mexican football club Necaxa. But guess who’s along for the ride?
  Taking a break from north Wales, Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney soon arrive
  with advice, and become investors. The formula for this documentary genre
  feels familiar by now: screamingly passionate fans; the drawing of a parallel
  between the fate of club and town; and a carefully curated, slightly oversold
  rags-to-riches narrative. Does this trend feel like cultural colonialism yet?
  It’s getting close. Disney+, out now *** Butterfly In the wake of Assassin,
  here is another collision between international espionage and family life in a
  South Korea-set thriller adapted from a graphic novel by Arash Amel and
  Marguerite Bennett. David Jung (Daniel Dae Kim, from Lost and The Good Doctor)
  is living in quiet semi-retirement when his past comes roaring back to life.
  First, he learns that there’s a price on his head. Then, he discovers that the
  assassin who has been sent to kill him is someone he knows. It is anything but
  mould-breaking but Kim is a smoothly enigmatic lead. Prime Video, from
  Wednesday 13 August *** Sausage Party: Foodtopia Tragic scenes as this
  inventive, enjoyably crude animation returns for a second season; a food fight
  is in progress. All is not well in the newly established republic of
  Foodtopia: the rule of Frank Frankfurter (Seth Rogen) is challenged and he and
  his friends are forced into exile. Soon, Frank and pals wind up in New
  Foodland, surrounded by all sorts of weird snacks. But can these unfamiliar
  foods be trusted? While Sausage Party is underpinned by a degree of satirical
  intent about human behaviour, gross-out fun is always prioritised. Prime
  Video, from Wednesday 13 August *** Limitless: Live Better Now Actor Chris
  Hemsworth fronts this earnest and self-indulgent celebrity self-improvement
  challenge series in which he attempts to rewire his brain, body and soul by
  taking on three assignments. Apparently, there’s a scientific basis behind
  each of the missions though, sadly, emulating Hemsworth will be beyond all but
  the richest and most well-connected of viewers. Can he climb a frozen 600ft
  wall? Complete South Korean special forces pain training? And, perhaps most
  urgently, learn to drum in time to perform on stage with Ed Sheeran? Disney+,
  from Friday 15 August *** Fit for TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser This
  documentary series takes us behind the scenes of NBC/USA Network’s high-stakes
  weight loss competition The Biggest Loser. It’s halfway between a celebration
  and an interrogation of the format, with plenty of former participants
  claiming the show transformed their lives for the better while other
  interviewees wonder whether the show is exploitative or disrespectful of its
  contestants. Even more damagingly, there’s the suggestion of real health risks
  being taken. As one contributor says, “You can’t have a show based on weight
  loss that is safe.” Netflix, from Friday 15 August
