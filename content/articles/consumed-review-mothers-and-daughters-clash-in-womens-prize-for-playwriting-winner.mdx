  Karis Kelly’s drama won the Women’s prize for playwriting in 2022 and you can
  see why. Set amid a family reunion dinner in Northern Ireland, only the women
  are present here. And in the way of many such theatrical reunions, it leads to
  an almighty blow-up, yet there is no hint of cliche. Kelly is a talented
  playwright navigating between black humour and pain. At the head of the table
  is Eileen (Julia Dearden), a foul-mouthed matriarch whose 90th birthday they
  are celebrating. Gilly (Andrea Irvine) is her daughter and the mother of Jenny
  (Caoimhe Farren), who left long ago for a life in London. Muireann (Muireann
  Ní Fhaogáin), the youngest, is Jenny’s London-born-and-raised daughter.
  Slickly directed by Katie Posner, it is horribly, humorously, gripping:
  reminiscent of Beth Steel’s Till the Stars Come Down at its best, with flecks
  of Martin McDonagh’s mother-daughter drama The Beauty Queen of Leenane.
  Daughters cyclically blame their mothers for the pain and harm they’ve
  inherited, while letting their fathers off the hook. Eileen appears, at first,
  like a cartoonishly drawn battleaxe, but she is perhaps best at hiding
  vulnerability. Gilly has comical spurts of rage despite her cultivated,
  singalong calmness. Jenny is full of blame towards her, pointing out maternal
  shortcomings like a stroppy teen, and is superbly played by Farren. Muireann
  is the flattest character, satirised for her gen Z talk of gluten and
  environmental harm. She has an eating disorder but it is too briefly broached
  and appears to fit the greater scheme of a play in which each woman is
  grappling with suppressed trauma, passed down and ingested as their own. The
  play travels from dining table realism to the baroque. The rumbles in Beth
  Duke’s sound design foreshadow this turn into lyrical and symbolic new ground.
  Talk of Northern Ireland’s past peppered the early scenes but it now becomes
  clear that this cross-generational family represents a bigger history of
  violence. The play’s shape-shifting is part of its audaciousness, but this
  late turn is brief and leaves much hanging. It is a lot to grapple with in 70
  minutes and you feel as if Consumed could be developed into a bigger play at a
  longer length, or streamlined for this shorter one. Either way, its potential
  is clear. At the Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, until 24 August. Then touring
  from 3 September. All our Edinburgh festival reviews
