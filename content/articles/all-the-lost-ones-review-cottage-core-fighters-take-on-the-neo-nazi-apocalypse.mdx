  It used to be zombies we were afraid of; now, rightwing secessionists are the
  big bad – zombies of a different order, you might say. They are the
  antagonists in this low-budget but well-performed survival drama from Canada,
  which posits escalating clashes between environmentalists and a neo-Nazi
  militia calling itself the United Conservancy (UC) that has formed a breakaway
  state somewhere along the north-eastern seaboard of North America. Ordinary
  citizens who just want to survive and don’t want to make America great again
  are compelled to huddle together in rural isolation. It’s in one such cell
  that we meet sisters Nia (Jasmine Mathews) and Penny (Vinessa Antoine), who
  are living with a diverse assortment of other decent folk. In their
  cottage-core accommodation, the group live off homegrown and foraged food, and
  occasionally have spirit-lifting drink parties. But not long after Nia
  discovers she’s pregnant – her boyfriend Ethan (Douglas Smith) and she have
  been trying for ages and had given up hope of conceiving – they encounter some
  UC thugs in an abandoned town. Nia shoots one, sort of in self-defence and
  sort of because he’s clearly a racist bigot. Her act brings more UC militiamen
  to their home, and the whole cell has to fight or surrender, although they’re
  badly outgunned and surrendering is clearly no guarantee of safety. Director
  Mackenzie Donaldson, who worked as a producer on cult Canadian sci-fi series
  Orphan Black, gets strong performances from her mostly little-known cast,
  especially Mathews, who has real star quality and range. The ancillary
  characters are fairly well limned with a few bits of business as Nia and Penny
  navigate a deadly obstacle course to freedom. The dramatic rhythms of
  tension/release, capture/escape do grow a little metronymic over the long
  haul. But in terms of politics, the film is at its best when drawing out how
  polarisation tears apart families as well as nations: the personal is always
  political. • All the Lost Ones is on digital platforms from 1 September.
