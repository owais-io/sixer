  ‘community sentiment’

  The gambling giant Sportsbet has splashed ads for its expanded same-game
  multi-bets on the AFL’s website, months after pulling them from free-to-air
  broadcasts due to “strong community sentiment”. The ads, which reveal
  Sportsbet now accepts same-game multi-bets on how many possessions a player
  acquires during a match, encouraged people to “bet now” and surrounded the AFL
  homepage. While the ads did not breach any rules, Sportsbet has previously
  voluntarily withdrawn ads for the same product on different platforms “after
  listening to stakeholder and community sentiment on gambling advertising”.
  “Same-game multis” allow gambling on a combination of outcomes such as
  possessions and goal scorers, and all must succeed for the bet to be paid out.
  Analysis has shown that multi-bets have a high fail rate for gamblers. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email The crossbench MP Kate Chaney, who sat on a
  parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy,
  said the ad showed why the gambling industry’s attempts to self-regulate had
  failed. “Expecting gambling companies to take their own hand out of the cookie
  jar is a joke and the government must know it,” Chaney said. In early July,
  weeks before the ad was published, the communications minister, Annika Wells,
  met the AFL’s chief executive, Andrew Dillon, to discuss the government’s
  long-awaited plan to restrict gambling advertising. The former communications
  minister Michelle Rowland’s proposed changes, made in response to June 2023
  parliamentary inquiry, were abandoned shortly before the election. The inquiry
  recommended a total ban on gambling advertising after a three-year transition
  period. The independent Australian Capital Territory senator David Pocock
  urged the federal government to fast-track its reforms and said the industry
  could not be trusted to regulate itself. “Sportsbet response to concern over
  recent advertising highlights this, after they pulled advertisements from TV
  only to then splash them over the AFL’s website,” Pocock said. Prof Samantha
  Thomas, a Deakin University academic who specialises in gambling and who gave
  evidence to the inquiry, said the ad was “a clear example of why comprehensive
  bans are needed”. “Partial restrictions will continue to leave the door open
  for the gambling industry to promote their products across multiple
  platforms,” Thomas said. The Alliance for Gambling Reform’s chief executive,
  Martin Thomas, accused Sportsbet of “virtue signalling” by removing its ads
  from television and then “resorting back to type” by splashing them on the
  AFL’s website. Sportsbet and the AFL were contacted for comment. Unlike
  television broadcasts, the ad was only visible to people aged 18 or older.
  Anyone who visits the AFL website can also opt out of seeing gambling odds and
  wagering content. This year Guardian Australia reported that leaked documents
  showed that the AFL received a bigger share of gambling revenue when people
  submitted same-game multi-bets. Shortly before the season began, the AFL
  sought an even bigger share of revenue from these bets, arguing the money was
  necessary to address an “unprecedented” increase in “integrity risks” posed by
  the wagering industry. That proposal was not accepted by some bookmakers and
  the Victorian gambling regulator is considering whether to make an
  unprecedented intervention in the dispute, which could set a limit on the
  league’s revenue from wagering. Wells has also discussed proposed gambling ad
  restrictions with the NRL chair, Peter V’landys, and chief executive, Andrew
  Abdo, Seven West Media’s chief executive, Jeff Howard, and the chief
  executives of Free TV Australia and Foxtel. Before those meetings, Wells met
  Rod Glover, who was Peta Murphy’s husband for more than 20 years before she
  died from cancer in December 2023, six months after delivering her report into
  gambling harms. Sources familiar with the consultation say it has focused on
  identifying the main objections and testing support for compromises. They say
  the government intends to act by the end of the year. • In Australia, Gambling
  Help Online is available on 1800 858 858. The National Debt Helpline is at
  1800 007 007. In the UK, support for problem gambling can be found via the NHS
  National Problem Gambling Clinic on 020 7381 7722, or GamCare on 0808 8020
