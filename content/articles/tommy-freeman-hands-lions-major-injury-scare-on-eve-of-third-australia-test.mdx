  Tommy Freeman has handed the British &amp; Irish Lions a major injury doubt
  before their third Test against Australia. The 24-year-old winger, who has
  started the first two Tests, sat out the captain’s run on Friday and it is
  understood he is struggling with a back injury. The Lions are targeting a
  first clean sweep since 1927 and a first unbeaten series since 1974. On Friday
  the Lions were adamant that Freeman would be fit to play in Sydney, claiming
  his absence was down to his workload being managed. It is understood, however,
  that contingency plans have been drawn up that could see Huw Jones moved to
  the wing and Owen Farrell coming into the starting XV. Mack Hansen would be an
  option if fully fit but he has missed the first two Tests with a foot injury
  and was deemed “85%” fit earlier in the week. Other options include Duhan van
  der Merwe and James Lowe with Blair Kinghorn switching from the left to the
  right wing. Jamie Osborne could also be a consideration. This season Freeman
  has featured in 33 matches, surpassing the 30-match limit mandated by the
  Rugby Football Union. “He was just doing the light walk-throughs,” said the
  assistant coach John Dalziel. “Wingers will do a lot of high-intensity running
  so he had the morning off. He’s got to view a stadium which is hopefully going
  to come to life tomorrow. “There’s no easy way to be a winger when you are
  chasing kicks and balls up in the air in the way the first two Tests have
  gone, so it’s quite easy for those guys to get their metres up.” Tadhg
  Furlong, meanwhile, has called on the Lions to make lasting memories as the
  tourists seek to wrap up a first clean sweep since 1927. The Ireland tighthead
  prop will make his ninth consecutive start for the Lions, moving to joint
  fifth on the all-time list and though the 32-year-old did not entirely rule
  out the 2029 trip to New Zealand, he conceded the clash in Sydney is likely to
  be his last for the touring side. “You’re still playing for the Lions, it’s
  not hard to motivate yourself,” he said. “My motivation is obvious. I’m not
  going to say I won’t [but] I probably won’t play for the Lions again. It’s
  been very good to me. It’s been very good to my career. You want to play well
  in it. “Without being clinical about it, you want to give the best version of
  yourself to it. Sometimes the last memory is the lasting memory you have in a
  jersey. I want it to be a good one. I think you can use [that] towards your
  advantage, just the appreciation of it. Understanding what makes the Lions so
  special or why it’s so special to you. You don’t want to get too caught up and
  emotional about it because you have to do a job. “Lions tours are some of the
  best days of your career and I’m delighted to be able to go again.” There were
  question marks over Furlong’s fitness at the start of the tour after he
  arrived into camp in June with no game time since early May due to a calf
  problem. “It wasn’t a big enough injury to warrant [thinking I wouldn’t make
  it],” he added. “It was like, we need to get back and play here, lads, because
  it’s on your calendar. You want it so badly. I think the cruel thing is when
  you go on one, you just want to go on more. You go on that first one and you
  take it all in. “The second one, you want to perform and the third one you
  just want to appreciate it all because you don’t want it to pass you by. There
  was a stage this season where we were having conversations with medical staff.
  It’s like, what is going on here? We need to nip this stuff in the bud.” While
  Furlong forms part of an unchanged all Leinster and Ireland front row,
  Australia have changed two-thirds of theirs with Taniela Tupou coming in at
  tighthead and Billy Pollard promoted to the No 2 jersey after a late injury to
  Dave Porecki. Tupou nicknamed “the Tongan Thor” has endured a difficult season
  in Super Rugby and will head to Racing 92 next season but Furlong is only too
  aware of the threat posed by the 23-stone prop. “I first came across him in
  2018, he was a young fella breaking through,” said Furlong. “He was coming off
  the bench for Australia. He is what he says in the tin. He’s incredibly
  powerful. He’s dangerous in the scrum. Very aggressive. He poses his own
  threats around the park. He’s a good carrier, explosive.”
