  People in New South Wales have been warned to “stay ready and stay safe” as
  another bout of intense rainfall, which could lead to floods, is about to hit
  the state. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued flood watches across NSW,
  including parts of the mid-north coast, Hunter, Nepean and north west slopes.
  A major flood warning has been issued for the Namoi River and a moderate flood
  warning for the Peel River. The NSW SES deputy commissioner, Deb Platz,
  acknowledged people were worn out after a run of wild weather, but she urged
  people to prepare. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “We do know that people are
  tired, and that can lead to some complacency. Please, for your own safety,
  think of your family, friends and colleagues, your neighbors, please stay
  abreast of what is happening,” she said. “We’re urging the community to be
  ready and be safe.” The weather is expected to deteriorate later on Wednesday,
  according to the SES, with heavy rainfall likely in areas west of Tamworth and
  along the northern coast. The “wettest period” for NSW and southern Queensland
  would come between now and Friday, according to the bureau. Miriam Bradbury,
  senior meteorologist at the BoM, said widespread and persistent rainfall was
  expected over the coming days, reaching totals of between 60 and 120mm, with
  some places likely to receive in excess of 150mm. “Some of those higher
  accumulations include places like Sydney [and] all the way up to around the
  Gold Coast in Queensland,” she said. That amount of rain falling on already
  saturated ground could lead to flash flooding and rising rivers, she said.
  According to the BoM, the weather system was caused by a low pressure trough
  along the state’s coastline, drawing in moist air from the ocean – with
  warmer-than-average sea temperatures – and a high pressure system in the
  southern Tasman Sea. By 5pm Wednesday, the SES has issued 28 warnings,
  including a Watch and Act for people living in Goangra and surrounding areas,
  near the Namoi river, which could flood. The SES has already received more
  than 480 calls for help, and has responded to more than 180 incidents.
  Residents in affected areas were encouraged to prepare their homes by clearing
  gutters and downpipes, trimming trees and tying down loose items. Platz
  reminded people to stay out of flooded areas. “It is extremely dangerous to
  play, walk through, or drive through any flooded waters, and we do expect to
  see significant road closures during this particular event.”
