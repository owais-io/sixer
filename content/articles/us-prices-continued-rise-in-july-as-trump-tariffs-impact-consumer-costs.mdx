  US prices continued to rise in July, according to key economic data released
  on Tuesday, as Donald Trump’s international tariffs shakeup started to impact
  consumer costs. Prices were 2.7% higher last month compared with a year ago,
  according to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the prices of a
  basket of goods and services. Though inflation dipped down in the spring, the
  annualized inflation rate jumped up 0.4% since April. Though the inflation
  rate stayed stable between June and July, core inflation, which excludes the
  volatile energy and food industries, went up 3.1% over the last month – a
  higher pace than what was seen in June. Prices for takeout and restaurants
  jumped up 3.9% over the last year, pushing up overall food prices by 2.9%.
  Prices for used cars, housing and medical care also jumped up higher than the
  overall rate. Overall energy prices were down 1.6% for the year, what probably
  stabilized the overall pace of inflation. The report is the latest to show
  that the US economy is experiencing some turbulence from Trump’s unparalleled
  shakeup of US trading policy, despite insistence from Republicans that the
  economy is “firing on all cylinders”. On top of a 10% universal tariff on all
  imports, Trump has set higher tariffs for dozens of countries, including the
  US’s top trading partners. On Monday, hours before a midnight deadline, Trump
  delayed enacting steep tariffs on China for another 90 days while negotiations
  continue. Although many of these tariffs only went into effect 7 August,
  Trump’s 10% universal tariff, along with higher tariffs on certain industries
  like steel and aluminum, have been in effect since the spring. Economists say
  that it takes time for tariffs to show up in consumer prices. Some retailers
  have been stocking up their inventory to delay the impact of tariffs and keep
  prices stable. But the jump in prices suggests that companies have started to
  pass down costs to customers, as leaders of companies like Walmart, Nike and
  Macy’s have said would happen. Tariffs have also hit the labor market harder
  than economists had anticipated. Data released earlier this month dramatically
  revised down job figures that initially showed a healthy job market. The
  government had reported 291,000 jobs were added to the economy in May and
  June, but the revision brought the total down to 33,000. The increase in
  prices and the shrinking labor market has thrown the US Federal Reserve into a
  tight spot. The Fed’s twin mandate is to maximise employment while keeping
  inflation in check. Trump has lambasted the central bank, arguing it needs to
  cut rates interest rates in order to spur growth. But Fed officials have
  refrained from a rate adjustment, citing uncertainty about the impact of
  Trump’s tariffs on prices. Trump has spent the last few months directing his
  ire at economic officials – first at the Fed, and now at the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics (BLS), which collects and reports economic data. Just hours after
  July’s job figures report showed a sluggish month of job growth, Trump fired
  Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of BLS. Citing no evidence, Trump claimed
  that the job figures “were RIGGEDOn Wednesday, he nominated economist EJ
  Antoni, longtime critic of the BLS, to oversee the department. After the
  latest inflation figures were released, Trump claimed: “It has been proven,
  that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other
  problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our
  Treasury’s coffers.” The president also, once again, attacked Fed chair Jerome
  Powell and suggested he might sue Powell over costly renovations to the Fed’s
  buildings. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell must NOW lower the rate,” Trump wrote on
  his social media platform, Truth Social. “I am, though, considering allowing a
  major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly
  incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed
  Buildings.”
