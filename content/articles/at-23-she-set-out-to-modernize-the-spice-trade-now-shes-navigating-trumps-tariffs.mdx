  In 2016, turmeric lattes were all the rage, but Sana Javeri Kadri thought the
  ones in San Francisco, where she lives, tasted nothing like the fresh spices
  she grew up with in India. A former line cook who was doing marketing for a
  Bay Area grocer, Javeri Kadri “knew [her] way around spices”, but was new to
  the industry. Still, she booked a ticket home to Mumbai, hoping that she could
  get richer flavors into US pantries. After reaching out to a number of
  growers, she met an organic turmeric farmer and, using her tax refund and a
  loan from her parents, bought a batch of the crop. It became the foundation of
  Diaspora Co, which Javeri Kadri launched the following year at just 23. From
  the outset, Javeri Kadri aimed to bypass industrial spice farms, whose
  products she found bland, and instead source from farmers using regenerative
  practices. This meant working directly with the producers and paying them a
  living wage. “By rough math, I probably reached out to around 2,500 farmers,”
  she said. After two years of growing a US market for her turmeric, Javeri
  Kadri added black pepper to the mix. For a while after that, it was an
  “exponential growth curve”, she said. Today Diaspora Co has 24 employees and
  sells around 40 different spices and blends, sourced from 140 different farms
  in India and Sri Lanka. Diaspora Co is part of a wave of new spice companies,
  including Burlap &amp; Barrel and Spicewalla, that center sourcing from
  sustainable farms, paying producers a living wage, building a more transparent
  (and streamlined) supply chain – steps they say allow them to put noticeably
  fresher spices on the market. Javeri Kadri said it was common knowledge in the
  industry that because of the long supply chains, it can take years for spices
  to reach consumers, meaning they are “expired before they even get to you”.
  She said Diaspora Co farmers rotate their crops, maintain plant diversity and
  use water-retention systems – regenerative practices that not only minimize
  the farms’ carbon footprint, but also make them more resilient to climate
  shocks. That meant when extreme flooding struck Tamil Nadu, India, last year,
  Diaspora’s cardamom farm “had such great aerated soil and such good
  irrigation, they were only in standing water for a few hours before the soil
  and the property was able to flush itself clean”, minimizing losses, she said.
  Javeri Kadri stressed that her partners were already practicing sustainable
  agriculture before she arrived on the scene, but she connects them with each
  other. “If you get them talking, they problem-solve themselves,” she said.
  “They’re all experts.” Diaspora Co enjoys low worker turnover and lasting
  partnerships, something Javeri Kadri attributes to the company’s commitment to
  fair wages. “Once we build a relationship with them, it never goes anywhere,”
  she said. In 2022, Diaspora Co launched a fund for farm workers, offering
  financial literacy workshops and providing seed money to open bank accounts,
  among other things. At a cardamom farm, workers asked for a community room and
  kitchen, which Javeri Kadri admitted wasn’t what she expected. But “it’s what
  they need, not what we think sitting in America that they need,” she said.
  “Really the point of it is that we listen to the workers directly.” Franco
  Fubini, a Diaspora Co board member and founder and CEO of sustainable food
  sourcing platform Natoora, said Javeri Kadri wasn’t just “trading spices”, she
  was building a unique supply chain and helping to catalyze demand for products
  that “are created in harmony with nature”. He added: “Whenever you have a
  company that is creating a market by stimulating demand, buying the right
  product, paying the right price for it, and creating a healthy farming
  ecosystem – that is what revolutionizing the food system is all about.”
  Diaspora’s efforts to, as Javeri Kadri puts it, “decolonize the spice trade”
  have also proven profitable. She’s raised about $2.5m from angel investors in
  the last few years, and though she declined to share revenue numbers, she said
  the company had grown twentyfold over the past five years. Its spices are now
  sold in 400 US stores, and last year, with help from Natoora, Diaspora Co
  expanded into the UK. Rather than pressuring existing partners to produce more
  and more, which could tax the land (and workers), Javeri Kadri said she plans
  to keep adding new farm partners in order to continue to boost production.
  Javeri Kadri has other projects on the horizon, including a new Masala Chai
  tea blend, another blend developed with the former Top Chef host Padma
  Lakshmi, and a cookbook featuring recipes from partner farms. “A lot of people
  tell me, ‘Oh, Indian food is intimidating or heavy or complicated,’ and the
  whole premise of the book is, how do we make it as bright and fresh and
  accessible as possible?” Javeri Kadri said. She plans to roll out these
  projects while managing an altogether new challenge: This month, Donald Trump
  said he would raise tariffs on Indian products to 50%, a move that Javeri
  Kadri predicts will cost her company between $100,000 and $200,000 by the end
  of the year, leaving her no choice but to eventually raise prices. (She said
  they had already paid about $20,000 in tariffs since April, when the US
  imposed its initial levies.) Javeri Kadri’s entire business model is built on
  sourcing spices from the areas they are indigenous to in south Asia, which
  means she couldn’t pivot her supply chain even if she wanted to. “People will
  say, ‘Well, we don’t need those exotic ingredients anyway,’” she said. But,
  she added, “there’s nothing as American as apple pie. And apple pie relies on
  cinnamon. An American classic is vanilla ice cream; we don’t grow vanilla. A
  lot of these ingredients are inherently not exotic, but they come from
  elsewhere.” Tariffs could have an especially devastating effect on
  mission-driven companies like Diaspora, which operate on small margins even as
  they prioritize single-source farms and fair labor, said David Ortega, the
  Noel W Stuckman chair in food economics and policy at Michigan State
  University. “These tariff price increases can really jeopardize those
  priorities.” With the higher tariffs – and the economic uncertainty
  surrounding trade policy – Javeri Kadri acknowledges that it may be hard to
  grow in the US market over the coming years. Her approach? “We grow elsewhere.
  We go where we’re not penalized for doing business,” she said. “It’s very
  simple.”
