  Kai Havertz will miss Arsenal’s showdown at Liverpool on Sunday and Germany’s
  World Cup qualifiers next month, with a decision yet to be made on whether the
  forward needs surgery on a knee injury. Havertz picked up the injury during
  his substitute appearance against Manchester United on the opening Premier
  League weekend and did not feature in Arsenal’s 5-0 win over Leeds on
  Saturday. Mikel Arteta said Arsenal were not sure how serious it was and that
  they would conduct more tests “to explore the issue a little bit further and
  decide what we’re going to do”. Rudi Völler, the men’s national team director
  at the German football federation, has confirmed Havertz will miss their World
  Cup qualifiers against Slovakia and Northern Ireland and said surgery remained
  a possibility for the 26-year-old. “He certainly won’t make it, he has a knee
  injury,” Völler said. “We don’t know exactly how it will go in the coming
  weeks, whether surgery is upcoming or it will be treated conservatively.”
  Havertz was sidelined from early February to mid-May last season after a
  hamstring tear at a training camp in Dubai. Fears that his latest injury could
  result in another lengthy layoff is believed to have prompted Arsenal to
  follow through on their longstanding interest in Eberechi Eze, who could make
  his debut at Anfield after his £67.5m move from Crystal Palace. Bukayo Saka is
  also expected to be absent against Liverpool and from England’s World Cup
  qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia after sustaining a hamstring injury
  against Leeds. That is not as significant as initially feared, with the
  23-year-old understood to have not had to see a specialist, although Saka is
  likely to be out for about three to four weeks. The captain, Martin Ødegaard,
  is a doubt for the trip to Anfield after injuring a shoulder. Arsenal are
  interested in signing Piero Hincapié from Bayer Leverkusen but need to sell
  fringe players before pressing ahead with a deal for the Ecuador defender, who
  is capable of playing as a left-sided centre-back or left-back. He has a
  release clause of €60m (£52m) and is believed to be keen to join. Arsenal have
  already spent about £250m this summer and are hoping to make sales before the
  window closes on Monday. Porto have offered a loan deal for Jakub Kiwior with
  an obligation to buy for €25m (£21.5m) and the Poland defender is believed to
  have his heart set on a move away from the Premier League despite interest
  from English clubs. Porto have also shown interest in Oleksandr Zinchenko, and
  Fábio Vieira and Reiss Nelson could leave in the coming days.
