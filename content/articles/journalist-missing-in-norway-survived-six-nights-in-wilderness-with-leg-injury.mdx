  Rescuers in Norway have found the award-winning environmental journalist Alec
  Luhn alive after he went missing in the remote Folgefonna national park and
  survived nearly a week alone in the wilderness with a serious leg injury.
  Luhn, a US-born reporter who has worked for the New York Times and the
  Atlantic and was a regular Russia correspondent for the Guardian from 2013 to
  2017, was reported missing on Monday after he failed to catch a flight to the
  UK from Bergen. Luhn, 38, had been holidaying with his sister in Norway and
  set out on a four-day hike alone on 31 July from the outdoor centre of
  Ullensvang, on the northern edge of the park, a 550 sq km wilderness in the
  west of Norway that is home to one of the country’s biggest glaciers. At a
  press briefing from Haukeland hospital in Bergen, the head of the air
  ambulance service and trauma centre, Geir Arne Sunde, said Luhn had hurt
  himself on the evening he set out. “He is seriously injured, but not
  critically injured,” he said. Rescue teams found Luhn at 11.34am local time on
  Wednesday, the Norwegian Red Cross said. “He has managed in the mountain in
  very bad weather for five days, without much food or drink,” Sunde said. “He
  has been very lucky.” “I can’t remember us finding someone alive after so many
  days,” said Stig Hope, head of the operations leadership team at Folgefonna
  and a Red Cross volunteer. “The search doesn’t always end like this – but
  today, it did. It’s a huge relief for everyone who’s been part of the effort.”
  A volunteer search and rescue team from the Red Cross, police, dogs,
  specialised climbing teams and drones were all involved in looking for him.
  The operation had to be suspended late on Monday night and then again on
  Tuesday owing to rapidly deteriorating weather conditions, including heavy
  rainfall. Sunde said Luhn had heard the helicopters searching for him for
  several days before one of them finally spotted him. Luhn’s sister Drew Gaddis
  confirmed in a social media post that he had been found “in overall good
  health” and was being transported to Bergen by helicopter. She thanked the
  Norwegian police, the teams of staff and volunteers involved and the thousands
  of people who had helped share news of the search. “We can breathe again!” she
  said. Veronika Silchenko, Luhn’s wife, told the Verden Gans newspaper: “We are
  very, very happy. Many thanks to everyone in Norway who has helped find him.”
  Among numerous awards, Luhn has two Emmy nominations. He was based for many
  years in Moscow, then Istanbul, and now lives in the UK where he specialises
  in climate journalism and is a Pulitzer Center Ocean Reporting Network fellow.
  Folgefonna, the third largest icecap in Norway, is on a peninsula famed for
  its fjords, mountains, rivers, lakes and icefalls. It has been a centre for
  wilderness adventure since the 19th century. Parts are desolate and can be
  treacherous, especially in poor weather.
