  It is 1.30am in the New South Wales town of Moree, and a 16-year-old passenger
  in a stolen Audi is using his phone to film the speedometer as the needle
  climbs towards 150km/h. He shares the video with his friends on the social
  media app Snapchat, a court later hearing he thought it was a “cool thing to
  do”. But in NSW – and increasingly across the country – such posts are
  illegal. This week, the Victorian and Western Australian parliaments became
  the latest to consider so-called “post and boast” laws, as almost every
  jurisdiction in the country makes it illegal for offenders to publish footage
  of their crimes on social media. The laws passed in Victoria on Thursday, but
  will be considered by a parliamentary committee in WA before being put to a
  vote there. The introduction of such reforms has come despite legal and human
  rights groups repeatedly arguing the laws are both harmful and pointless, as
  they create a further mechanism for locking up young people under the false
  pretence of addressing a problem already handled under existing law. “We’re
  seeing a troubling race to the bottom across the country, with governments in
  multiple states competing to be the toughest on children in the justice
  system,” Dr Mindy Sotiri, executive director of the Justice Reform Initiative,
  says. “‘Post and boast’ laws sound catchy and might work for political
  point-scoring in the short term but are ultimately just a headline-grabbing
  distraction. The reality is these laws will be completely ineffective. “They
  won’t deter offending, they won’t shift the way children and young people are
  using social media and they won’t address the drivers of crime. What these
  laws will do is drive more and more children deeper into a failing justice
  system.” The Moree case referred to a youth offender known by the pseudonym
  Nadj. His case is one of the few publicly available court decisions about
  someone charged under the laws. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The children’s
  magistrate in his case found that there was no evidence Nadj was motivated by
  “posting and boasting” when the car was stolen, that there was no information
  about how many people saw the Snapchat post, and that there was nothing in the
  post that would give others information about how to steal cars. “The public
  policy rationale for this offence is that boasting has the capacity to
  encourage others to engage in criminal behaviour,” children’s magistrate Paul
  Hayes found in his decision from March this year. “It might send the message
  to impressionable young people that criminal acts are socially acceptable. It
  may make others think it is desirable to commit crimes. It might influence
  people to commit offences to circulate on social media. It may also provide
  people with information or ideas about how to commit criminal offences.
  Posting and boasting glorifies crime. “Nadj says that the posting is a ‘cool
  thing to do’ but isolates this to his peer group … in this case the
  seriousness is the dissemination – not so much the effect.” Nadj could have
  been penalised with a maximum two years’ imprisonment under the laws, but
  Hayes found the post would not greatly contribute to his aggregate sentence
  for other offences. A month earlier, Hayes dismissed similar charges involving
  a boy known by the pseudonym Harry, who was 13 when he was also allegedly
  involved in stealing a car and “disseminated material” about this theft,
  leading to a “post and boast” offence. The first state to implement the laws
  was Queensland when the then Labor government, facing intense criticism over
  its response to crime, passed them in early 2023. The Minns government in NSW
  followed suit, passing similar laws in March 2024, and the Northern Territory
  government also implemented post-and-boast offences with two-year maximums in
  October last year after sweeping to power on a tough-on-crime mandate. South
  Australian laws were next, after they were introduced by an independent upper
  house MP, Frank Pangallo, who wanted a presumption against bail for youth
  offenders who posted and boasted about their crimes. That measure did not pass
  parliament, but another version of the laws – which also had two-year maximum
  penalties – did. “Criminals can seek to gain notoriety by posting and boasting
  which could potentially incite or encourage others, and further embolden their
  own illegal acts,” the attorney general, Kyam Maher, said in a statement in
  May. “This legislation is an important step forward in protecting the
  community from offenders who seek to glorify illicit activities.” The rhetoric
  used by Maher is common when governments trumpet these changes in media
  releases. There are repeated references to “crimfluencer”, a pun on social
  media influencers, and wordplay such as “no likes for lawbreakers”. The
  Tasmanian government promised it would introduce similar laws last year, while
  the ACT government has no plans to introduce them. Peter Dutton even promised
  federal post-and-boast laws had the Coalition won the May election. The laws
  generally only apply to certain offences, and in some cases include carve-outs
  to ensure that media coverage or awareness campaigns are not endangered. Sonya
  Kilkenny, the Victorian attorney general, said in her second reading speech
  that the bill now meant a person who posted online about a home invasion faced
  a maximum penalty of 27 years in prison: 25 for the home invasion, and two for
  the post. “One of the challenges confronting our community today is the rise
  of ‘posting and boasting’ about criminal offending,” Kilkenny told parliament
  in June. “The performative nature of these offences introduces a new layer of
  harm: it glorifies criminal behaviour, encourages others to emulate it,
  exacerbates community concerns and fear, and erodes public confidence in the
  justice system. It may also publicly identify and retraumatise victims.” ‘No
  long-term benefit to community safety’ Performative is exactly how critics of
  the laws describe the governments who are passing them. Judges and magistrates
  could already consider the fact a person posted about their crimes on social
  media as an aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing, regardless of
  whether post and boast laws existed. Offenders who champion their offending on
  social media were already likely to cop harsher sentences, especially
  considering such posts often feature in police briefs of evidence. The
  proposed Western Australian laws are considered particularly problematic,
  because of the possibility they could be used to outlaw peaceful protest. In a
  letter sent to the attorney general, Tony Buti, earlier this month, the
  Conservation Council of WA executive director, Matt Roberts, urged the
  government to make a carve-out in the laws protecting protest and satire. “We
  understand the legislation is intended to deter the glorification of illegal
  activity on social media. We share the concerns of youth justice advocates and
  legal professionals who say the laws may have a disproportionate impact on
  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly young people,”
  Roberts said in the letter. “We are also concerned the legislation may
  unintentionally lead to the repression of peaceful, nonviolent protest,
  including for environmental causes.” Tom Penglis, the co-founder of the WA
  Justice Association, told the West Australian there was no evidence such laws
  reduced crime, saying “they’re based on ‘vibes’ not evidence”. Sotiri, from
  the Justice Reform Initiative, agrees. “It is a total fantasy to believe that
  threatening harsher penalties will deter children from offending … every
  jurisdiction that has taken this ‘tough on crime’ approach has seen the same
  result: higher incarceration rates, more children cycling in and out of
  harmful remand, and no long-term benefit to community safety.”
