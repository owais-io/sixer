  The letter was effusively polite, the allegations anything but. “We have the
  honour to address you,” the seven United Nations special rapporteurs began
  their correspondence to the head of Jiangsu Guotai Guosheng garment factory in
  China’s Xinjiang province. The 2021 letter then detailed allegations of brutal
  working conditions for members of China’s Uyghur minority, reportedly forcibly
  transported hundreds of kilometres and arbitrarily detained for re-education
  and forced labour. “Workers are reportedly required to work in fenced-in
  factories … allegedly exposed to intimidation, coercion, threats, and
  restriction on their freedom of movement, and are subjected to surveillance by
  security personnel and through digital tools.” The UN experts asked for more
  information about their “grave concerns”. “The alleged forced detention and
  labour of members of the Uyghur minority and their living conditions may
  amount to torture or other degrading, cruel or inhuman treatment,” they wrote.
  There was no response. Four years later, the letter to Guotai is now a part of
  a federal court case brought by the Australian Uyghur Tangritagh Women’s
  Association (AUTWA) against the retailer Kmart, seeking preliminary discovery
  of documents relating to Kmart’s supply chains and potential links to forced
  labour in the Uyghur homeland, known as Xinjiang or East Turkestan. Guotai
  appears on Kmart’s 2025 factory list. Kmart insists it has no connection to
  forced labour. Guotai not only appears on Kmart’s factory list: the company or
  its parent is present in at least four lists publicly reported in Australia,
  including Target (which is owned, like Kmart, by Wesfarmers), Big W (owned by
  Woolworths) and Fast Retailing, the company behind Uniqlo. There is no
  prohibition on using Guotai as a supplier. Australia’s modern slavery laws
  only require that companies report on their supply chains. And if they fail to
  report, there is no penalty. ‘Businesses must do more’ In 2023 the former
  ombudsman Prof John McMillan led a review into Australia’s nascent Modern
  Slavery Act. His report found a “widely endorsed view … that there is no hard
  evidence that the Modern Slavery Act, in its early years, has yet caused
  meaningful change for people living in conditions of modern slavery”. Key
  among his 30 recommendations was that the act be updated and strengthened to
  include: an obligation that companies must address modern slavery risks in
  their supply chains, not simply report on them; penalties for companies that
  fail to comply; and high-risk declarations for regions, factories or suppliers
  where the risk of modern slavery is severe. The government did not respond
  until December 2024: key recommendations have not yet been implemented. The
  government released a consultation paper in July. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email Once billed as world-leading, Australia’s now seven-year-old Modern
  Slavery Act risks becoming a global laggard, anti-slavery advocates say.
  Unlike comparable jurisdictions, such as the US and EU, Australia has no ban
  on imports linked to forced labour, nor does it require companies to act on
  modern slavery risks – only to report them. In the wake of the Kmart federal
  court case, Australia’s anti-slavery commissioner, the former Labor senator
  Chris Evans, said the systematic use of forced labour in Xinjiang was
  well-documented. “Australian businesses must do more to understand their
  supply chains and take action to address known risks,” he said. “The
  Australian government must also do more to support them.” Evans said while
  other countries had introduced measures such as high-risk product lists and
  import bans, Australia had not. “We need better public access to information
  and data about which products are high risk, what products are entering
  Australia, and who is importing them.” The attorney general, Michelle Rowland,
  tells Guardian Australia the government is “committed to combatting modern
  slavery in all its forms”, saying its immediate priority is responding to the
  McMillan review, starting a public consultation and monitoring international
  developments. “These will inform the development of balanced measures to
  support and incentivise Australian businesses to take actions to eliminate
  modern slavery risks and practices, and combat them in their supply chains,”
  she says. ‘Alarm bells ringing’ Ramila Chanisheff, the AUTWA president, says
  the court action against Kmart seeks to create “transparency”. “The
  state-sanctioned mass imprisonment, repression and forced labour of Uyghur
  people is a known phenomenon,” she tells Guardian Australia. “We’re demanding
  answers from Kmart so we know whether its actions live up to its words about
  addressing forced labour risks in its supply chain.” Chanisheff says every
  member of Australia’s tight-knit Uyghur community has been affected. Some have
  not been able to speak to relatives for years, and don’t know where they are,
  others censor their contact for fear of retribution. “Our community has lost
  family members, friends and loved ones because of China’s brutal treatment of
  Uyghurs,” she says. “Kmart is a go-to store for so many people in Australia.
  If the company has profited in any way from this sort of systematic
  repression, I am sure Australians would be horrified.” Kmart said it was
  “disappointed” AUTWA had chosen to launch court action, saying: “At no point
  has the AUTWA engaged with Kmart to explain or identify any specific alleged
  inadequacies.” Kmart said it had offered to meet AUTWA on several occasions.
  “Kmart is committed to respecting human rights in our operations and supply
  chains,” a spokesperson said. “Transparency is a key principle of our Ethical
  Sourcing Program. Kmart publicly discloses its Factory List on its website and
  was the first Australian retailer to do so.” The retailer said it invited
  feedback on its approach to ethical sourcing and investigated any concerns
  about its operations and supply chains. The ethical sourcing program, “which
  helps us to identify and mitigate modern slavery risks”, had been in place for
  more than 15 years, the spokesperson said. On Baptist World Aid’s Ethical
  Fashion Guide, Kmart scores 58/100, putting it in the top 20% of more than 450
  brands. But Freya Dinshaw, associate legal director at the Human Rights Law
  Centre, said “alarm bells have been ringing for a long time” over the risk of
  forced labour in the Chinese garment sector. “This court case is about Kmart
  coming clean on whether it is really doing everything it claims to be doing to
  ensure that its products are slavery free,” she said. Dinshaw said the case
  also highlighted weaknesses in Australia’s modern slavery laws. “It shouldn’t
  be left to members of the public to take companies to court and force them to
  open their books where there are suspicions of links to modern slavery,” she
  said. “Buying clothes should never come at the expense of someone else’s
  freedom.” ‘Fast-moving crime’ The anti-slavery campaigners Fuzz and Carolyn
  Kitto, co-directors of Be Slavery Free, argue that the fight against the
  “fast-moving crime” of modern slavery requires constant evolution. “Modern
  slavery doesn’t stay still,” Fuzz Kitto tells the Guardian. “In our estimation
  … about 30,000 new people every single day are being caught in slavery. And we
  can get out about 180 a day: 30,000 in, 180 out.” Forced labour practices are
  fluid, designed to escape detection, he says: audits of factories are often
  announced in advance; selected respondents can be coached in their answers;
  and “ghost” factories are set up solely for the purpose of being audited. But
  technology is allowing the anti-slavery campaign to compete. Tools such as
  Million Makers allow factory workers to report on their conditions through
  their smartphones – with the information going directly to independent
  servers. Workers are paid a day’s wage for their responses: at some factories
  between 80% and 100% of workers have provided information. Other tools,
  including SourceCertain and Oritain, can detect the origin of products – from
  chocolate bars to blended cotton garments – tracing the source of goods
  through layers of intermediaries. The Kittos argue Australia’s laws should
  mandate a “due diligence” model, obliging companies not only to report on
  their supply chains, but act on slavery risks if identified. Fiona David,
  founder of Fair Futures and one of the creators of the Global Slavery Index,
  said Australia’s modern slavery laws urgently needed strengthening to ban the
  import of goods made with forced labour. “It’s unacceptable that in Australia
  at the moment, there is nothing to stop or prohibit people from importing
  goods into Australia that have been made or that have been suspected to have
  been made by forced labour,” she said. “Many people would be surprised to
  learn that there are no restrictions on importing products that have been made
  by forced labour into Australia.” David said Australia’s legislation needed to
  move beyond “a regime that focuses all of corporate effort on writing reports
  about modern slavery, and shift attention to actions required by companies and
  outcomes”. “At the moment the government is leaving it to each business
  individually to work out what it thinks is responsible business when it comes
  to labour risks. We have a situation where unscrupulous companies actually
  benefit by getting away with doing the wrong thing.” Do you know more? Contact
