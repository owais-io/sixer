  cinematic art

  As a child, while other kids were playing with toys, Apichatpong Weerasethakul
  was content with a flashlight. “That was enough: the shadows on the wall or
  the blanket,” he says. “I chose to work in cinema because of that feeling of
  taking me back to childhood, that freedom and curiosity.” This primal
  fascination with light and shadow has fuelled a career spanning three decades,
  across experimental features and video works, feted by the likes of the Cannes
  film festival and London’s Tate Modern. It has also produced some of
  contemporary cinema’s most captivating and puzzling imagery – from the talking
  animals of his 2004 psychological drama Tropical Malady to the ghosts and
  human-catfish sex in his hallucinatory 2010 Palme d’Or winner Uncle Boonmee
  Who Can Recall His Past Lives. His latest film, 2021’s Memoria, starring Tilda
  Swinton as a woman haunted by a rumbling boom only she can hear, features a
  startling image of an alien spacecraft rising out of the Colombian jungle.
  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips
  for the weekend, every Saturday morning The most remarkable thing about these
  images is their matter-of-fact presentation. Weerasethakul depicts the
  fantastical in the same realist style he observes everyday life and his
  characters react to strangeness with zen acceptance. As with the logic of
  dreams, incomprehensible scenes make perfect emotional sense. This dream-like
  sensuality is strongly felt in his new work: A Conversation with the Sun
  (Afterimage), a monumental video installation at Sydney’s Museum of
  Contemporary Art. In the vast darkness of the museum’s Macgregor gallery, a
  random assortment of clips featuring quotidian imagery – palm fronds against
  the sky, a harbourside at night, Weerasethakul’s friends, including Swinton –
  play across a large screen while a curtain of floating white fabric moves
  slowly up and down in front of it. The cumulative effect of these image
  shards, layered and dissociated from narrative context, is the sensation of
  swimming through a sea of jumbled memories or dreams. As with all his work,
  Weerasethakul is reluctant to affix meaning – not only for viewers but also
  himself. “Over the years, I’m unconsciously drawn to certain objects or
  circular motifs, like sleep and dream,” he says. “I wasn’t really conscious
  about this until scholars and critics wrote about it. I was like, ‘Oh, am I
  like that?’ I intentionally try not to analyse or think about the work because
  I prefer something very spontaneous and organic.” A Conversation with the Sun
  (Afterimage), conceived with longtime collaborators Rueangrith Suntisuk and
  Pornpan Arayaveerasid, draws primarily on Weerasethakul’s 10-year-deep trove
  of video diaries, shot on a lo-res pocket camera that Weerasethakul calls his
  “particular eyes”. The camera’s sensitivity to light transformed what he saw;
  scenes of a wagging dog or a long walk through a garden often become
  overexposed or disintegrate into grainy irresolution. Intercut with
  Weerasethakul’s personal archive is Suntisuk and Arayaveerasid’s footage of
  Indonesian caves – a potent symbol: the site of humans’ first storytelling
  endeavours, in wall paintings and tales told around the flickering flames of
  communal fires. The movement of the curtain within the installation draws
  viewers’ attention to the delicacy of the images; it also calls attention to
  the projector beams, bringing us into keener awareness that light is a vessel
  for memory and illusion, and also an impermanent and changeable force. “His
  work gets us close to appreciating the things that as humans we do respond to
  – basic things like light, nature – in a way that you almost lose awareness
  that you’re actually viewing art,” says the work’s curator, Jane Devery. “It
  gets very close to the experience of being in front of something overwhelming
  and sublime in nature. I think that’s what people respond to, and I certainly
  do.” Weerasethakul, sometimes referred to as a proponent of slow cinema, is
  known for his glacial pacing and wide, static frames. The elongated sense of
  time and lush compositions force the viewer to pay close attention to details
  we typically overlook – and, in the process, discover surprising marvels. A
  shift in the quality of light reveals the arrival of the ghost, or a complete
  transformation of identity. You may become entranced by the meditative thud of
  rainfall and a slow trek through an ancient cemetery, or you may fidget,
  waiting for answers to emerge, aware that you’re a restless body experiencing
  a complex illusion created by an artist. This kind of mindful, active watching
  is Weerasethakul’s goal: “[My work] plays with the audience’s awareness of
  illusion, of the material, of the space, too,” he says. “Even in my feature
  films, there are many moments where I like the audience to be aware that you
  are sitting with other people in the cave – a modern cave! It’s not like
  classic cinema where you lose yourself.” In Afterimage, this sense of agency
  is heightened: there is freedom to move around the dance of the drape, to
  chase a compelling spectre before it vanishes. The randomised images act as a
  Rorschach test of sorts, tapping into the profound mystery of our memories.
  Why does a particular shade of green remind us of childhood, or a hike we took
  one spring? Or why do I find the image of circular scribblings on notepaper,
  imposed over a slowly encroaching flame, profoundly unsettling? Each person,
  with their own unique wells of memory, will have a different experience in
  this collective space; Weerasethakul invites us to craft our own personal
  poetry. This sense of freedom is crucial to Weerasethakul, whose film career
  has been dogged by Thailand’s censorship board from the get-go, with his 2002
  romance Blissfully Yours edited to remove graphic sex scenes. His visual arts
  practice has given him a way to work more freely. “It’s getting harder and
  harder to make personal cinema,” he says. “And when you are uncompromising,
  you have to wait years and years for funding. In between that time, this kind
  of practice has become very natural, like breathing.” Afterimage, the first
  installation Weerasethakul has created specifically for Australian audiences,
  offers an opportunity to experience one of the most distinctive imaginations
  in cinema. “I would just encourage people to see it for a long time,”
  Weerasethakul says. “Sit on the floor, walk around. Because the work will not
  be the same.” • A Conversation with the Sun (Afterimage): Apichatpong
