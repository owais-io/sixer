  When it comes to coral, the Great Barrier Reef steals the global limelight.
  It’s a bucket-list place for many and, when it gets hit by coral bleaching, it
  makes news around the world. But Australia has another group of spectacular
  reefs on the west of the continent. Many of them had managed to escape the
  worst of global heating, until the worst marine heatwave ever recorded for
  this region. Even a “hope spot” for coral reefs has been decimated by the most
  severe heatwave on record for that part of the world. I’ve been following the
  fate of the reefs on both coasts over recent months, and for today’s
  newsletter I’ll try to make some sense of it – after the most important reads
  of the week. When you’re the biggest living structure on the planet, it’s not
  surprising you would hog the headlines. When the climate crisis is putting you
  under pressure, you light up like a million raised white flags to let the
  world know you’re in trouble. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR), on Australia’s
  Queensland coast, is bigger than Italy and home to thousands upon thousands of
  species of fish, coral, molluscs and other amazing stuff. This Australian
  summer, parts of the reef saw mass coral bleaching for the sixth time since
  2016. We learned last week that the bleaching the previous summer – the worst
  on record there – drove the biggest annual drops in coral cover since detailed
  monitoring started in the mid-1980s. But on the opposite side of the vast
  continent, Western Australia (WA) has its own World Heritage-listed reef at
  Ningaloo, famed for its corals and whale sharks. And just like the GBR might
  overshadow Ningaloo on the name-recognition stakes, so does Ningaloo
  overshadow Western Australia’s other remote and largely pristine coral reefs.
  Most of WA’s reefs had escaped major heat stress events, at least until the
  “longest, largest and most intense” marine heatwave ever recorded in the
  state’s waters started to unfold around September 2024. This week, marine
  scientists from government agencies and universities revealed the most
  comprehensive assessment yet of the known impacts of that heatwave. From
  Ningaloo north, reefs saw between 11% and more than 90% of their corals hit by
  bleaching, and death on systems as far as 1,500 km apart (for UK readers,
  that’s farther than driving from Land’s End to John o’Groats or, for American
  subscribers, a few hours farther than a drive from New York to Chicago).
  Scientists found hardly any live corals on three remote but spectacular reefs
  at Rowley Shoals. The shoals, more than 1,000 km from Darwin in the Northern
  Territory, are described by some as one of the world’s greatest diving spots.
  Scientists speak of them with reverence. With their steep drop-offs and
  sandy-bottomed lagoons covered in corals and teeming with life, they had been
  a “hope spot” for marine scientists because they had been largely untouched by
  the rising ocean heat that has hit most of the world’s reefs. Until now.
  Australia’s reefs are not the only ones suffering. Reefs elsewhere are also in
  the midst of an ongoing global bleaching event that has caused enough heat to
  bleach more than 80% of reefs in more than 80 countries since it started in
  January 2023. How, or if, these reefs recover is an open question. Corals are
  complex animals, and the reefs they make with their skeletons in tropical
  waters are some of the richest places, in biodiversity terms, on the planet.
  They make up less than 1% of the ocean floor, but are home to about a quarter
  of marine life. They support the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions
  of people. Previous work published by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on
  Climate Change has warned that if global temperature increases hit that famous
  1.5C increase, then 70% to 90% of tropical reefs will disappear. The reality
  is likely more complicated. Scientists are still learning about how much
  capacity corals have to acclimatise, and are still understanding how reef
  systems will respond depending on their size, location and other pressures
  such as fishing and pollution. What solutions might there be? There’s the
  obvious one: get greenhouse gas emissions down as low as possible, as fast as
  possible. And there are a suite of more direct efforts, from developing more
  heat-resistant corals and “restoring” reefs by planting out more heat-tolerant
  species, to brightening clouds to shade reefs, to improving local conditions
  to make corals as resilient as possible. None of the coral scientists I’ve
  spoken to argue that any of these steps are a substitute for climate action,
  and there’s a live debate among them about the wisdom of some of these
  interventions. The lowest-risk approach for averting an ecosystem collapse
  remains tackling global heating. Without it, the surviving corals will keep
  raising the white flag of alarm. Read more: WA’s ‘longest and most intense’
