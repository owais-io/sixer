  South Africa’s sport, arts and culture minister, Gayton McKenzie, is under
  investigation by the country’s human rights commission for historical social
  media posts containing a highly offensive racial slur, reigniting a debate
  about racism, identity and the lingering effects of colonialism and apartheid.
  McKenzie, an anti-immigrant populist from the Coloured community with a
  history of stirring up controversies, was given a Wednesday evening deadline
  by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to issue an approved
  apology, undergo sensitivity training, donate to an agreed charity and delete
  the X posts, which were still online at the time of publication. The posts
  came to light after the hosts of a podcast called Open Chats said on an
  episode that Coloured people committed incest and were “crazy”. The podcast
  segment was later removed. McKenzie’s Patriotic Alliance party, which got 2%
  of the vote in 2024 national elections and draws its support mainly from
  Coloured people, filed complaints with the police and the SAHRC. McKenzie told
  the national broadcaster: “There should be no place to hide for racists.”
  Social media sleuths soon unearthed posts made on X between 2011 and 2017,
  where McKenzie had used the word “kaffir” – a racial slur for black people –
  though he was not directing it at particular individuals. In posts on X on 11
  August, McKenzie denied being racist and said he was also Black. “I did tweet
  some insensitive, stupid and hurtful things a decade or two ago, I was a troll
  &amp; stupid,” he wrote. “I cringe when seeing them and I am truly sorry for
  that. I shall subject myself to the investigation.” Tshepo Madlingozi, the
  SAHRC’s anti-racism commissioner, told a local TV channel, Newzroom Afrika, on
  17 August: “The use of the K-word has been declared unlawful. The use of the
  K-word, to quote the constitutional court, is unutterable … the court has made
  it very clear that it is one of the most offensive slurs that one can use.” He
  said of the posts still being online: “The harm is ongoing, the harm continues
  and the alleged offences are still there.” The white minority apartheid
  regime, which took power in 1948, forcibly separated South Africans into
  Native, Coloured, Indian and White categories. It lumped together mixed-race
  people – descendants of south-east Asian enslaved people, Khoisan Indigenous
  communities, other black Africans and Europeans – as Coloured and gave them
  slightly better benefits than their Black counterparts. Today, official data
  is still collected in four racial categories – Black African, Coloured,
  Indian/Asian and White. Coloured people were 8.2% of the population in the
  2022 census. The tensions that the apartheid “divide and rule” strategy
  fostered are still evident. “In my entire life, I have never called anybody
  the K-word, never. We are the victims. This is a political campaign,” McKenzie
  said in a Facebook Live video on 10 August. McKenzie and his spokesperson did
  not respond to requests for comment. Tessa Dooms, co-author of the book
  Coloured, said: “Even if what he had to say was not meant to be derogatory, in
  a context where Coloured communities have been accused of anti-blackness, the
  use of that word by a very prominent Coloured figure in society would always
  be read in the context of presumed anti-blackness.” She said that while some
  Coloured people were racist, “anti-blackness was cultivated as part of the
  apartheid project”. The enduring tensions are owing, in large part, to many
  communities still living in the separate areas forced on them by apartheid,
  said Jamil Khan, who researches Coloured identities at the Johannesburg
  Institute for Advanced Study. Khan said: “What this shows us, really, is that
  South Africans don’t really know each other.”
