  Good morning. Dozens of countries have been hit with higher taxes on their
  exports to the US after Donald Trump’s latest wave of tariffs came into effect
  on Thursday morning. The levies announced by the White House a week ago came
  into force at a minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday, shortly
  after Trump claimed on social media that the tariffs would send billions of
  dollars into US government coffers. The rates, which range from 41% for
  war-torn Syria to 10% for the UK, are being levied in addition to the usual
  tariffs applying to US imports. Since last week’s announcement, governments
  around the world have been scrambling to try to make deals to avert tariffs
  they fear could scare off investors and lead to job losses. Toyota, the
  world’s biggest carmaker, said it expected its operating profits to drop by
  16% in its financial year to March 2026 due to the levies. Has anyone been
  spared from double tariffs? The EU is the only trading partner whose baseline
  rate – fixed at 15% after a deal – will include previous tariffs. Trump could
  meet Putin for Ukraine war talks ‘as soon as next week’ Donald Trump could
  meet Vladimir Putin to discuss the Ukraine war as early as next week, White
  House officials have said, although senior aides warned that significant
  “impediments” remained to securing a ceasefire. Asked late on Wednesday when
  he would meet the leaders of Ukraine and Russia, the US president told
  reporters at the White House: “There’s a good chance that there will be a
  meeting very soon.” But he added that there was no specific advancement
  leading to talk of a meeting. The New York Times and CNN, citing sources
  familiar with the plan, reported that Trump planned to meet Putin as soon as
  next week. Trump reportedly then wants a three-way meeting with the Russian
  leader and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. When did the US and
  Russian leadership last meet? In June 2021, in a Geneva meeting between the
  then president, Joe Biden, and Putin. Assault on Sudan’s Zamzam refugee camp
  may have killed more than 1,500 civilians More than 1,500 civilians may have
  been killed in an attack on Sudan’s largest refugee camp in April, in what
  would be the second-biggest war crime of the country’s devastating civil war.
  A Guardian investigation into the 72-hour attack by the paramilitary Rapid
  Support Forces (RSF) on North Darfur’s Zamzam camp discovered repeated
  testimonies of mass executions and abductions. Hundreds of civilians remain
  unaccounted for in the attack. The war between the Arab-led RSF and the
  Sudanese military, which has been raging since April 2023, has been
  characterised by repeated atrocities. How has the number been arrived at? A
  committee created to investigate the death toll has so far counted more than
  1,500 killed in the attack, in which it was previously believed that 400
  non-Arab civilians had been killed. In other news … The former Superman actor
  Dean Cain has said he has enlisted to join Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (Ice) in support of Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration. JD Vance’s team
  raised the water level of a lake in Ohio to accommodate the vice-president’s
  recent boating vacation with his family, the Guardian can reveal. US police
  have charged a British man with the attempted murder of his daughter-in-law
  after he allegedly tried to drown her in a swimming pool in Florida. Stat of
  the day: Only 1.5% of Gaza farmland left for starving Palestinians due to
  Israel’s war, UN says Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has left starving
  Palestinians with just 1.5% of farmland that is accessible and able to be
  cultivated, figures from the UN show. This has fallen from 4% in April,
  according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), indicating that
  Israel has continued to target Palestinian croplands since it began its total
  blockade in early March, while Gaza is now on the brink of a “full-scale
  famine”, the FAO director general said. Don’t miss this: Catastrophe! Heroism!
  Paranoia! The dangerous romance of survivalist stories From Silicon Valley
  billionaires to posters on Reddit’s r/collapse forum, survivalism, or
  prepping, is undeniably having a moment. The term “survivalist” goes back to a
  1975 novel by the same name – but authors have been telling the stories of
  those who persist against the odds for centuries. “The difference between a
  survivor and a survivalist is that one is a temporary condition and the other
  a permanent identity,” writes Dorian Lynskey as he charts their depiction in
  culture. Climate check: What recreating Scott’s Antarctic trip reveals about
  our seas today In January, scientists traced the route charted by Carsten
  Borchgrevink’s Southern Cross, Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Discovery and Capt
  Robert Falcon Scott’s Terra Nova expedition between 1898 and 1913. Aiming to
  measure how global heating is affecting the marine life in the world’s
  southernmost waters, their findings contained a mix of “sweet and sour”, the
  lead oceanographer said. While they recorded “crazy levels” of wildlife,
  including 150 whales, in the world’s only area largely untouched by plastic
  pollution and the fishing industry, planetary heating means waters are
  increasingly acidic. As a result, the sea urchins they collected were fragile
  and crumbled easily – a worrying indication for marine life. Last Thing: Rugby
  player selected to play for All Blacks has passport eaten by dog Leroy Carter
  was happily surprised to get the news that he had been selected for the All
  Blacks squad to play in Argentina in the opening rounds of the Rugby
  Championship. But soon after, he made a less-than-ideal discovery: his dog had
  eaten his passport. Luckily, he seems to have sorted out an emergency one and
  kept a cool head: “I thought it would happen to me, something like that, so no
  point getting stressed about it.” Sign up First Thing is delivered to
