  Panorama: Lucy Letby – Who to Believe? 8pm, BBC One Lucy Letby is the nurse
  found guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven more –
  but international experts say there’s no evidence any crimes were committed.
  Following ITV’s recent investigation into the complex case – which this paper
  called “one of the most meticulous documentaries in years” – Judith Moritz now
  reassesses the evidence with the defence and the prosecution for this Panorama
  report. Hollie Richardson Holiday Parks Exposed 7pm, BBC Two BBC News uncovers
  the “dark side” of the UK’s holiday park industry. Amid allegations from
  holidaymakers of being threatened and ripped off, reporters go undercover in
  Yorkshire to reveal how some holiday caravan homeowners are being misled. Lucy
  Parry also speaks to whistleblowers and insiders. HR Nicola Sturgeon: The
  Interview 7pm, ITV1 The MSP was Scotland’s longest-serving first minister and
  the first woman to hold the position – and now she has written all about it
  and more in her forthcoming memoir. Here, she tells all to Julie Etchingham
  (well, as much as they can fit into half-an-hour). HR Michael Mosley: Secrets
  of the Superagers 8pm, Channel 4 Something inside so strong: this episode of
  the late Michael Mosley’s exploration of human longevity focuses on how best
  to boost our immune systems. It involves a peloton of pensioners in Surrey,
  unlocking the mindful secrets of tai chi and Mosley breaking bread with a
  strapping 98-year-old in southern Italy. Graeme Virtue Human 9pm, BBC Two Of
  all the inflection points in the rise of Homo sapiens, the shift from nomadic
  life to permanent settlements was one of the most crucial. In the final
  episode of her rich and rewarding series about the evolution of humanity, Ella
  Al-Shamahi travels to ancient sites in Turkey and Egypt to reveal it was by no
  means a sure thing. GV The Gilded Age 9pm, Sky Atlantic Season three of Julian
  Fellowes’ 1880s-set drama set amid the self-regarding New York elite wraps up
  with – what else? – a big fancy ball. But fans of “railroad daddy” George
  Russell (Morgan Spector) will be keen to learn his fate after last week’s
  cliffhanger. With a fourth series confirmed, there will be more hobnobbing to
  come. GV • This article was amended on 11 August 2025. An earlier version
  referred to Nicola Sturgeon as a “former MSP”; in fact, she remains the MSP
  for Glasgow Southside.
