  There is no question Oliver Glasner will be taking Sunday’s Community Shield
  as seriously as his last trip to Wembley, for the FA Cup final. The Crystal
  Palace manager admitted he was still smarting from losing twice in a row
  against his daughter Alina at Connect 4 after the team’s recent tour to his
  native Austria, where they prepared for the game against Liverpool. “I was
  really upset, really,” Glasner said. “This, I think, is just a mindset you
  have and this is what we try to create always: have the confidence that you
  can win it and give your best.” Instilling that kind of belief into the
  players has been credited by the Palace chair, Steve Parish, with inspiring
  Glasner’s side to beat Manchester City in May. The Cup triumph was the south
  London club’s first major trophy and was meant to act as a springboard for
  further success, especially as Parish had promised after the semi-final
  victory over Aston Villa that they would not repeat “some of the mistakes” of
  last summer, when four players were signed on deadline day and Palace had to
  wait until their ninth Premier League game for a win. “It’s not how you wished
  a transfer window would work,” was Glasner’s withering assessment last
  October. But Palace’s planning has been severely disrupted by the uncertainty
  surrounding which European competition they will play in. Parish spent most of
  Friday at the court of arbitration for sport in Switzerland as the club
  attempt to have their demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League
  overturned. Glasner again revealed his frustration during the Austria tour,
  saying he had been “promised that we would be more active and bring in the new
  players earlier this year”. He attempted to downplay those comments on Friday
  and predicted that Palace would be in much better shape than at the start of
  last season. Glasner also straight-batted questions about the futures of
  Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi, both linked with moves away. He was never afraid
  to speak his mind about squad investment during spells in charge of Wolfsburg
  and Eintracht Frankfurt, and his reluctance to discuss extending a contract
  that, like Guéhi’s, expires next summer is another major headache for Parish
  to deal with. “This contract is not important at the moment,” Glasner said.
  Asked whether what happens before the end of August could affect whether he
  wants to resume talks, he replied cryptically: “We will see.” At Wolfsburg
  Glasner was set on a collision course with the sporting director Jörg
  Schmadtke – who spent a year at Liverpool in the same role – when, in November
  2020, he publicly criticised the failure to bring in enough attacking
  reinforcements after qualifying for the Europa League. Glasner remained in
  charge until the end of the season despite a rocky relationship with Schmadtke
  and guided Wolfsburg to fourth in the Bundesliga before leaving to join
  Eintracht. He voiced similar concerns after leading them to victory in the
  Europa League and agreed to depart at the end of the 2022-23 season despite
  reaching the German Cup final and the knockout stages of the Champions League.
  With only the backup goalkeeper Walter Benítez and Croatia defender Borna
  Sosa, who will compete with Tyrick Mitchell to start at left wing-back, added
  this summer, time is of the essence for Palace once they discover their fate
  at Cas on Monday. Signing a forward is a priority, having been beaten by Aston
  Villa to Ivory Coast striker Evann Guessand and with Eddie Nketiah likely
  sidelined for two months with a hamstring injury. Glasner would also like more
  defensive cover, with Chadi Riad expected to be out until at least October as
  the Morocco international recovers from a knee injury. “It’s not [that] I want
  investment – it’s about Crystal Palace,” Glasner said. “What I say is my
  expertise and my advice, what Crystal Palace should do to be competitive in
  four competitions. If somebody thinks that’s nonsense, OK, let’s see. That’s
  it. I didn’t say: ‘Hey, sign three players, because then Oliver Glasner is
  happy.’ I will go home and be happy today. Everything’s fine. If Crystal
  Palace want to make the next step and be better than last year, then it’s my
  advice. Let’s sign at least two players that can achieve this.” Palace are
  hopeful their appeal to Cas will be successful and Glasner acknowledged it had
  been difficult to accept Uefa’s decision at a club who have never played in a
  major European competition and will contest their first Community Shield
  tomorrow. “If we have to play in the Conference League it feels like we are
  punished but being innocent,” he said. “On the other side if we had ended the
  season in position seven and go straight into the Conference League we all
  would have celebrated. So these are the two feelings we have.”
