  The only ways I know to rave are festival-style or in the buzzed wee hours –
  the time between pubs shutting and trains starting. This means I’ve never
  walked into a cafe, fresh-faced and sober at 9am, with the intention of
  raving. But this is 2025, not the late 1990s, and people are possibly more
  questioning of the cost of partying on their bodies than they once were. So,
  coffee raves have become a thing. They’re all over the world and come in many
  shapes and sizes, tending towards the bijou. Inevitably, they’re big in Los
  Angeles and on social media, and are often the territory of young people,
  athleisurewear and brand collaborations. They’re so popular, they’ve also
  become fair game. In a TikTok rant last week, musician Keli Holiday said what
  I might have been thinking: “Call me old, call me jaded, but enough is enough,
  no more coffee raves … If you want to get your rave on … go to a rave or go to
  a club.” But on a rainy Saturday morning in central Sydney, I try one out –
  dubbed Maple Social Club – approaching with caution. I’m not a leisurewear
  wearer or an Instagrammer or indeed a coffee drinker. My young adult life was,
  rightly or wrongly, given to maximum nights out and minimum responsibility –
  and my weekends now are generally about children and sleep. If there’s a cafe
  involved, it’s usually peaceful. Organiser Taylor Gwyther, 25, tells me
  morning raves are an add-on to the night-time variety, not instead of. “But,
  there’s definitely a trend away from alcohol that I think encourages events
  like this to be popular,” she says as the first arrivals begin to enter the
  warehouse space behind Wilson cafe in Surry Hills. Sign up for the fun stuff
  with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every
  Saturday morning Maple Social Club, which Gwyther founded with Connor Cameron,
  23, is less than a year old and was inspired by run clubs and LA’s AM radio
  morning DJ sets. Their free events provide an alibi, Gwyther says, in the same
  way a run club is a little bit about running and a lot about meeting people.
  “Covid shut down a lot of social life and created lonely adjacent habits, and
  people are looking to revitalise how they spend their time,” she says. “We
  spend so much time online for work and now play, I think people are looking
  for places and spaces to spend offline. We’re trying to make it easier to find
  those things.” Morning raves also make sense on another, more local, level.
  Sydney residents are among the world’s earliest to bed and earliest risers. In
  a city whose nightlife sits well below its beaches, wealth and wellness
  reputations, mornings are sacrosanct. Plus, it’s expensive to party the normal
  way in a city with a famously stratospheric cost of living. A beer is about
  $12 in the pubs nearby. Here, a coffee is about $5 – and there’s no need to
  buy a drink at all. Because, as Bronte, a 30-year-old nurse tells me later on
  the dancefloor, “Who’s got money these days, really?” Michael Pung, 39, a
  property valuer from Sydney, saw the event advertised on Instagram. “I thought
  I’d check it out. I’ve been single for a while and I thought I might as well
  just come out and meet people,” he says, queueing in the long and slow-moving
  coffee line – which, handily for him, doubles as another opportunity to meet
  people. Like me, he’s not normally a coffee drinker but, given he was out late
  last night Latin dancing, he says “probably today’s the day”. I order a tea
  and a croissant, which feels plain weird, and join the throng as DJs Catch25
  and Haze near the end of the opening set. It’s already busy and I feel too
  exposed, too daylit, too close to too many raised phones. But, everyone – and
  I really mean everyone – is smiling. By 10am, the dancefloor is heaving with
  what feels like a roughly 50/50 mix of men and women. There are some older
  people, but generally the crowd is aged 20 to 35 – and as Gwyther predicted,
  “super diverse”. Some have made a morning of it and are wearing what I would
  consider proper going-out attire with high heels; others are grungy, and most
  are in baggy jeans. Bronte, who lives locally, is here with friends. She says
  her evening and night shifts as a nurse mean she is often socially “removed
  from the night”. She’s sweaty and happy and hard to hear above the music.
  “I’ve done all my walking for the day,” she says, referring to another thing
  that didn’t used to be a thing: step count. Like Pung, she also goes out at
  night-time, but having the option to dance her working week away come Saturday
  morning is, as she puts it, “very nice”. The music’s not quite loud enough, or
  bassy enough, to lose myself – but, by about 10.30am, I think I might be
  dancing. People near me are drinking iced matcha lattes, which I’ll never
  condone, but as the DJ drops a relative banger, I admit to my colleague, who
  is photographing this road test, that I’m having quite an uplifting start to
  my weekend. The day is still young and there’s an afterparty at a pub nearby
  and yet another planned for the afternoon. Before I leave (it’s approaching
  11am after all) I turn to talk to a man who is watching on from close to the
  DJ area. Liam, 25, is almost-but-not-quite dancing, and it turns out he works
  for Red Bull events. He’s here professionally: might Maple’s coffee raves be
  worth bringing into the energy drink’s gargantuan sponsorship embrace? “We see
  just as much relevance for Red Bull in an occasion like this [as] a music
  festival or the F1,” he says with no small amount of enthusiasm. Stepping
  around some spilt milk, it strikes me there is no alcohol-edged aggro, argy
  bargy at the bar or intimidating bouncers. Just music and broad daylight –
  plus caffeine, in hot, cold and increasingly corporatised modes.
