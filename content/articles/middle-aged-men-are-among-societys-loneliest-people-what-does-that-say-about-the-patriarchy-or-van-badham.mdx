  I’m unsure how this particular column got the job of public advocacy for male
  problems, but – relax, guys – I’m up for it. Think of it as the Mirror
  Universe version of when Tony Abbott appointed himself Minister for Women,
  except this time a feminist champions men’s social health and, you know,
  actually likes you. This week, the male friendship recession is our subject of
  shared concern. The Guardian reported a month ago concerning data from (where
  else?) America, which spoke to an observable decline in the prevalence of male
  friendship, with some notable demographic implications. Data from the Survey
  Center on American Life revealed 15% of men said they didn’t have “close
  friends” in 2021, compared with only 3% in 1990 while those reporting 10 or
  more close friends had decreased from 33% to 13% during the same period.
  Acknowledging that these figures were skewed by more male loneliness among
  heterosexual men than their gay brothers, the Guardian interviewed men working
  to facilitate male friendship outside the “third spaces” of congregation,
  activity and entertainment outside the home and work that queer male
  communities built for themselves. Creating better infrastructure for
  heterosexual male socialisation is a public health necessity, given that the
  isolation and loneliness reported in the wake of shrinking friendship networks
  has dire health implications. You can trust studies that repeatedly
  demonstrate that “those who experience social deficits, including isolation,
  loneliness, and poor-quality relationships, are more likely to die earlier,
  regardless of the cause of death”, or you can remember how mad we all went
  during Covid lockdowns and just imagine that being the rest of your life.
  Sadly, the figures in Australia seem to be following the US pattern, with
  studies from 2020 showing similar implications: “men who reported lacking
  close friends or relatives were around twice as likely to have thought about
  suicide in the past 12 months”. Other local studies exposed the loneliest age
  group of Australian men was middle aged (35-49 years), who were “three times
  more likely to feel high-level loneliness than men aged over 65”. It’s this
  demographic distinction amid rates of friendship decline that underscore how
  the phenomenon isn’t rooted in biological destiny, but rather in the way
  western culture’s changing paradigms of masculinity straitjacket modern
  straight men into rituals and behaviours that denude them of connections and
  expose them to harm. Patriarchy – spoiler – is bad for men, too. Claims that
  men struggle to form friendships because of traditions of stoic masculinity’s
  model of consistently performed toughness and invulnerability do not really
  square with older generations of men having more friends and being more
  socially integrated, when performances of toughness in previous eras included
  resolving conflicts through violence and conscription in actual war. My
  grandad saw active service in the second world war and was, by all reports,
  great fun at a party. Claims that work obligations make it hard to find time
  to socialise also do not hold up to scrutiny because women of the same
  generational experience maintain powerful social connections despite their
  double modern burden of meeting work and care commitments. Clearly, what we
  are doing to the loneliest cohort is cultural but also new. And it’s becoming
  more of a problem: a shocking 25% of US boys and men aged 15 to 35 reported
  “feeling lonely for a lot of the previous day” as per a recent Gallup poll.
  It’s tempting to blame technology – but how do we explain the fact that women,
  girls and gay men have the same technology available to them but don’t seem to
  suffer the same misery? This also goes for the shrinking “third space” thesis,
  in which the fading social associations built around church attendance, union
  membership, and community and sporting clubs have impeded social connections,
  again, disproportionately. Rather, we might consider that an intersecting
  number of cultural changes are meeting new variations of old gender roles in a
  particularly destructive way, and with fewer social points of connection to
  bulwark men against them. If there is an explanation for the “skibidi toilet”
  theory of young male social detachment, in which “hyper-chaotic media serves
  as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online” we
  can reasonably assume its generation “fluent in irony but starved for meaning”
  has been created from specific gender targeting that niche marketing delivers
  through the internet and other media, affirming and amplifying the kind of
  gender role modelling through which parents – often unwittingly – channel
  their children into by, for example, reading to their girls but not their
  boys. For young men, whether it’s selling gaming consoles, supplements or
  Andrew Tate hate material, the convenient marketing message is
  instrumentalisation is more valuable to men than friendship. This is to
  apportion zero blame to parents, given that parenting is hard and as subject
  to the forces of history as any other institution. It’s not only the bloody
  internet and ruthless marketeers and capitalist labour exploitation that have
  encouraged the desocialisation of men. It’s not only the prevalence of
  technology. It’s that the pre-internet “Satanic Panic” disinformation event of
  the 1980s fostered a “stranger danger” anxiety that relocated children from
  open world roaming to controlled environments, in which messaging – loaded
  with old gendered instructions and new microtargeting – can assume more heft
  than lived experience. The children of the Satanic Panic generation are the
  lonely middle age men of today. Their isolation suggests the real “stranger
  danger” was who we let into the house. Van Badham is a Guardian Australia
