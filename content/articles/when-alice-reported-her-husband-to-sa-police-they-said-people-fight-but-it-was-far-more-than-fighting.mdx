  Alice* says that when she met the man who would become her husband, she didn’t
  see any of the red flags that eventually led to her being “physically,
  emotionally, verbally, financially and systematically abused by him”. “Whilst
  pregnant he would shove me into walls, pushed me and backed me into corners
  yelling in my face,” she wrote. When she tried to report him to the police,
  she was told “people fight”. He was eventually charged with aggravated
  assault. Alice’s story is one of many that Natasha Stott Despoja says will
  haunt her. It’s one of hundreds submitted to the South Australian royal
  commission into domestic, sexual and family violence, a commission Stott
  Despoja describes as being “born out of unimaginable loss”. After four women
  were killed in a single week in South Australia, the state government set up
  the commission in July last year. It heard “harrowing” stories from hundreds
  of victim-survivors. Stott Despoja, a former senator and ambassador for women
  and girls and founding chair of Our Watch, was appointed as commissioner. The
  royal commission’s report, With Courage, was released on Tuesday and runs to
  almost 700 pages. It includes 136 recommendations, some of which the
  government has already agreed to, including a dedicated portfolio for domestic
  violence. Stott Despoja wrote in the foreword that the commission received
  more than 380 submissions, held 48 public hearing sessions, more than 170
  listening sessions, and consulted with hundreds more people. She wrote that
  the report was a “call to action” for SA, which has “lost its way” on domestic
  violence. The recommendations focus on structural reform to create a “cohesive
  and effective system”; increasing the awareness and visibility of violence;
  supporting victim-survivors to get help; programs for people who use violence;
  longer-term supports for survivors, and a “strong foundation for prevention”.
  Some specific recommendations include a national standard for responsible
  media reporting, more resources for police, more accommodation, free
  healthcare for victim-survivors, screening for non-fatal strangulation, and
  strategies to minimise harm to young people on social media from pornography,
  the manosphere and incels. Other recommendations included restrictions on
  overnight alcohol sales, a 24-hour crisis line, and addressing rape myths and
  misconceptions. The commission found many communities are underserved,
  including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the LGBTQ+ community,
  people with disabilities, children, culturally and linguistically diverse
  people, and men who use violence. An accompanying report, Voices, lays out
  victim-survivors’ tales of violence and struggles with the system. Stott
  Despoja said the stories were “confronting”. “They tell the authentic stories
  of victim-survivors from all genders, backgrounds, beliefs and postcodes,” she
  wrote. “While their stories share heartbreak and sadness, many exhibit
  resilience and strength.” One said: “Every time a woman dies at the hands of
  her partner, a little piece of me dies. This will be my daughter one day as no
  one will stop him.” There were tales of sexual abuse being livestreamed,
  choking, coercive control, and stories of not being heard or believed, and of
  not being able to leave. People reported abuse by their partners, parents and
  children. The commission heard of the childhood trauma from an abusive home,
  of lingering injuries and financial suffering. There were also male
  victim-survivors, although the report noted victim-survivors were
  predominantly women and the overwhelming majority of perpetrators were men.
  Premier Peter Malinauskas said the stories made for “harrowing reading”. “But
  this report is also a document filled with hope,” he said. “It sets out a
  pathway to improve the way we respond to this scourge, and to prevent it from
  happening in the first place.” * Not her real name • In Australia, the
  national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. Children,
  young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55
  1800; adult survivors can seek help at Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380
