  Giving the average worker a $2,700 income tax cut in return for widening the
  GST would be part of a major tax overhaul that could add a combined $158bn to
  the Australian economy. Chris Murphy, an economist who provided the modelling
  for introduction of the GST and Ken Henry’s 2010 tax review, has outlined a
  $91bn shift in the tax mix, which includes replacing stamp duties with a land
  tax and taxing corporate super profits. “Comprehensive tax reform stands out
  as a way of delivering large benefits compared to other areas of economic
  reform,” Murphy says in a newly released paper. The proposed tax package would
  be budget neutral, according to Murphy’s estimates, but would lift real GDP by
  about 6%, boost business investment by 11% and increase the number of homes by
  8%. When announcing the roundtable on 18 June, Jim Chalmers raised hopes that
  the Albanese government was ready to tackle the thorny issue of tax. The
  treasurer told the National Press Club that “no sensible progress can be made
  on productivity, resilience or budget sustainability without proper
  consideration of more tax reform”. “I don’t just accept that, I welcome it,”
  Chalmers said at the time. Sign up: AU Breaking News email But the prime
  minister has proved less welcoming, telling journalists two weeks ago that
  “the only tax policy that we’re implementing is the one that we took to the
  election”. The final sessions of the roundtable process, on Thursday, focused
  on a “better tax system”. Murphy said shifting the tax base towards simpler
  and less-distortionary types of taxes was a useful starting point to think
  about potential reform. He said in his modelling, “inefficient state
  conveyancing duty and land tax are abolished, with the revenue replaced by a
  broad-based land tax like municipal rates”. “The company tax system is
  modified so that normal returns to capital are taxed less and economic rents
  and dividends are taxed more. “To broaden tax bases, GST-free categories
  become taxable and the payroll tax threshold is cut by 75%, funding a large
  cut in personal income tax.” Murphy estimates that 54% of Australian company
  taxes are based on so-called “economic rents”, such as super profits linked to
  oligopolistic sectors such as financial services, as well as rents from the
  country’s natural resources. Murphy says the answer would be a different type
  of company tax that cuts company tax rate, but introduces another tax to
  better target those rents – such as the 5% net cashflow tax recently proposed
  by the Productivity Commission. While the estimated benefits of these packages
  are large, the shifts in the tax base would be jarring. For example, Murphy’s
  analysis shows getting rid of stamp duties on residential property purchases
  and state-based land taxes on investment properties would remove two very
  inefficient taxes. But filling that budgetary hole would require a new land
  tax that would be equivalent to trebling municipal rates, Murphy said. “The
  states have to get back the money from abolishing conveyancing and state land
  taxes,” he said. Murphy said his next round of modelling would focus on the
  impact of the tax changes on the equity of the system, but that conceptually
  the household tax package – which included widening the net of the GST – would
  tend to raise the inequity of the tax system. In contrast, the corporate and
  property changes would likely be progressive. For example, Murphy said the
  evidence was that state land taxes drive up the cost of investing in property
  and artificially inflate rents. “There would be winners and losers, but
  there’s a strong argument that if you are doing tax reform, then go the whole
  hog, because what you lose on one thing, you might pick it up on something
  else,” he said.
