  Napoli are monitoring Rasmus Højlund, with the Italian champions considering
  making a move for the out-of-favour Manchester United forward. Antonio Conte,
  Napoli’s head coach, is an admirer of the Denmark international, and a loan
  deal is thought to be the favoured option. United would countenance a
  temporary deal for the 22-year-old, though there is no suggestion that he is
  being forced out of the club. United are, however, open to his departure due
  to the options Ruben Amorim now has in attack. Amorim left Højlund out of the
  matchday squad for Sunday’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford, with
  Matheus Cunha, signed from Wolvesin June, deployed instead as the hosts’
  centre-forward. Benjamin Sesko, who came on as a substitute, is expected to be
  Amorim’s first-choice in the position following his recent arrival from RB
  Leipzig. Højlund is also of interest to Milan. “We are evaluating him these
  days, but the transfer market is unpredictable,” the club’s sporting director,
  Igli Tare, told Sport Mediaset. “We know that we have to intervene in that
  position and we also know that they must be players who can give something
  more to this group.” Bournemouth have completed the signing of Ben Doak from
  Liverpool in a deal worth £25m. The 19-year-old attracted interest from
  Nottingham Forest and Leeds while Porto made a bid for the winger. But the
  Scotland international opted to join Andoni Iraola’s side and has completed
  the move following a medical. Liverpool negotiated a buy-back option in the
  transfer as they consider Doak has the potential to develop into a top
  attacking talent. The Anfield club did the same with Jarell Quansah’s £35m
  move to Bayer Leverkusen. Doak will make Liverpool a huge profit on the
  £600,000 they paid in training compensation to sign the teenager from Celtic
  in 2022. He made three Premier League substitute appearances for the club in
  total but impressed on loan at Middlesbrough last season before suffering a
  thigh injury. The departure of Doak means the Premier League champions have
  made £227m in player sales this summer, including add-ons. Liverpool remain
  keen to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle and Marc Guéhi from Crystal Palace
  before the transfer deadline on 1 September.” Nottingham Forest have completed
  the signing of the striker Arnaud Kalimuendo from Rennes for a fee of about
  £26m. Kalimuendo, who scored 17 goals in Ligue 1 last season, is the latest
  Forest addition after the arrivals of Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee,
  signed for £37m and £30m from Ipswich and Manchester City respectively at the
  weekend. Forest are also expected to sign Douglas Luiz, who is keen on a
  return to the Premier League from Juventus. The 23-year-old Kalimuendo, who
  started his career at Paris Saint-Germain, will provide Forest with welcome
  attacking depth. Igor Jesus, one of seven summer signings and one of two
  players to join from Botafogo, will provide competition for Chris Wood, who
  scored twice in the victory over Brentford on Sunday, and Taiwo Awoniyi.
  Forest explored a deal for Rico Lewis but the 20-year-old England defender has
  suggested he wants to stay with City. Pep Guardiola expects Lewis to remain at
  the club. “I’ve never ever seen myself leaving,” Lewis said after starting
  City’s 4-0 victory at Wolves on Saturday. “I’ve always wanted to play for
  City. It’s my dream. When I’m playing with the kind of players that I’m
  playing with, it brings out the best of me. I’m so happy.” The Aston Villa
  winger Leon Bailey is poised to join Roma on loan in a move that could become
  permanent. The Serie A club will pay about £2.5m for the season and have
  agreed a £19m option to purchase the Jamaica international. Bailey was used
  sparingly by Unai Emery last season and is one of several players Villa are
  keen to offload to generate financial headroom. Leander Dendoncker, who is
  close to joining Real Oviedo, and Àlex Moreno are among those surplus to
  requirements. Samuel Iling-Junior and Lewis Dobbin are wanted on loan by
  Championship clubs.
