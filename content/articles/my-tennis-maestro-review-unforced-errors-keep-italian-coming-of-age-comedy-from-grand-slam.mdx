  We have had some sparky tennis movies recently, such as Luca Guadagnino’s
  Challengers and Reinaldo Marcus Green’s King Richard, and it seemed at first
  as if this coming-of-age comedy from Italian actor turned director Andrea Di
  Stefano could be joining them. But despite a very robust lead performance from
  Pierfrancesco Favino, the enjoyably grizzled alpha male of Italian cinema,
  this completely runs aground in the third act, quite unable to decide if it
  should offer the traditional comeback story of an underdog sports movie, or if
  it should pursue its implied repudiation of the win-at-all-costs ethic. The
  other issue is whether its young hero should ignore what his dad has to say in
  favour of an attractive, if flawed, new mentor. The film does in fact appear
  finally to get off the fence on this last point, but not very satisfyingly or
  convincingly, and the final wink to the camera is irritating and misjudged.
  The setting is the early 1980s and Tiziano Menichelli plays Felice, a
  13-year-old kid who has been fanatically schooled by his dad in Italian
  tennis’s lower, relatively undemanding “regionals” competition. Felice has
  been taught to revere the stolid, machine-like baseline play of Ivan Lendl,
  and Felice’s grinding efficiency wears down his opponents. But the father then
  decides that his son deserves glory at the national level and to that end
  hires a professional coach with money the hard-pressed family really doesn’t
  have. That coach is the handsome, charming and yet somehow unreliable Raul
  “the Cat” Gatti, played with grinning machismo by Favino, who once got to the
  last 16 of a big competition, was pictured in the gossip mags, but dissipated
  his talent with booze and womanising, and now desperately needs the money
  after recovering from a breakdown in a clinic, a subject the movie treats with
  cheerful bad taste. While on the road with his new young pupil, doing the more
  demanding national under-16 tour, Pavino tells young Felice to forget about
  boring old Lendl and instead idolise the impossibly glamorous figure of
  Guillermo Vilas, the Argentinian man-about-town who loved clubbing and the
  good things in life, even or especially before a big game. But sobersided
  Felice won’t loosen up and it seems that his baseline style is crumbling in
  the face of attacking play from opponents in this higher league. Young Felice
  has got to come up to the net – in tennis, and in life itself. It all looks
  good for an enjoyable, sentimental comedy, and yet the movie’s running time
  drags closer and closer to the finish without Felice either winning a match or
  winning any new wisdom outside the court; nor is Raul coming to terms with his
  demons, which turn out to be far more complex and disconcertingly serious than
  we thought. Really, the movie can’t tie up all the loose ends it lays out in
  front of us. At the very beginning, Di Stefano hints that this film is
  inspired by moments from his own life, and real life can indeed be messy and
  complicated and fail to fit the Hollywoodised narrative template. This needed
  some script revision. • My Tennis Maestro screened at the Venice film
  festival.
