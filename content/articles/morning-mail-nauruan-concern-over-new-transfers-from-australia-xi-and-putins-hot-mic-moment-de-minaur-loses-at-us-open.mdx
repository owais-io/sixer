  Morning everyone. Nauruan residents are “worried for our pleasant island”
  under the Australian government’s controversial new $2.5bn plan to forcibly
  transfer a group of non-citizens there. Islanders are asking: “Where will they
  live? Will they work here?” Xi Jinping and Valdimir Putin have been caught on
  a hot mic talking about how organ transplants could lead to immortality,
  Florida scraps mandatory vaccines for children, and De Minaur has lost his US
  Open quarter-final. Australia Prized assets | The new federal parliament’s
  register of interests reveals that politicians have a wide range of sometimes
  surprising assets. These include part-ownership of race horses declared by
  Liberal MP Dan Tehan and Labor senator Helen Polley, and two senators gifted a
  book by Canberra scientologists. Nauru fears | The group of noncitizens
  described as “violent” and “appalling” by the Australian government, and set
  to be banished to Nauru for 30 years, have sparked concern among islanders.
  The deal is worth $408m upfront to Nauru, plus $70m a year for the life of the
  agreement, with a total cost to Australia of $2.5bn over 30 years. ‘Do they
  teach you this?’ | More than 100 properties have been searched in the hunt for
  the alleged Porepunkah police killer Dezi Freeman as footage emerged of the
  fugitive arguing with police about mask mandates and the law during the Covid
  pandemic. Labor split | The former Labor minister Ed Husic has rebuked Anthony
  Albanese’s assertion that “good people” attended last weekend’s
  anti-immigration rallies, saying “I haven’t seen a good fascist yet”. Neo-nazi
  Thomas Sewell – who has been charged with violent disorder over an alleged
  attack on a First Nations encampment after the Melbourne rally – will continue
  to commit violent offences that could lead to death, police told a court
  yesterday. Super idea | Couples could split their combined retirement savings
  without paying extra tax under a plan to address gender inequity in
  superannuation proposed by Liberal senator Jane Hume. World Hot mic moment |
  The authoritarian strongmen Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have mused on how
  organ transplants might lead to immortality during a brief exchange at a huge
  military parade in Beijing. Putin has invited Kim Jong-un to visit Russia as
  Kim promised to do “everything I can to assist” Moscow. Earlier, Xi told the
  gathering the world was facing a choice between peace or war. In God’s name |
  Florida is ending mandatory vaccines for children against preventable diseases
  with the state’s surgeon general saying the policy was a reflection of “God’s
  light”. Democrats have criticised the US state department over its oversight
  of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation amid concerns over rising death tolls near
  aid sites, the group’s apparent coordination with the Israeli army and links
  to intelligence operations. Failure of duty | Britain’s deputy prime minister,
  Angela Rayner, has admitted she underpaid stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside
  flat as problems mount up for the prime minister, Keir Starmer. Epstein’s
  ‘missing minute’ | A so-called “missing minute” of CCTV footage, a key
  ingredient of conspiracy theories surrounding the prison death of the sex
  offender Jeffrey Epstein, has been found. Survivors of his abuse have
  signalled their support for a bipartisan congressional resolution to release
  all the files on the convicted sex offender. Health | People who take a mobile
  phone to the toilet should keep to a two TikTok limit, according to doctors
  who found that toilet scrollers are more prone to haemorrhoids than phoneless
  lavatory-goers. Full Story Xi, Putin, Kim and a big parade: are we seeing a
  new world order? Helen Davidson talks to Nour Haydar about why Xi Jinping has
  invited some of the world’s most powerful men to China – and how these
  alliances are reshaping our world. In-depth For some, the weekend’s
  anti-immigration rallies showed a racist country, while others said they were
  the expression of ordinary people’s fears about migration. Whatever the
  answer, Margaret Simons argues, we can’t flinch and defend every time someone
  points out racism, and to fix that we need “a media and a politics capable of
  navigating and illuminating these complexities and ambiguities”. Not the news
  Common People Dance Eisteddfod, an annual gathering of people of all ages,
  abilities and bodies to dance together to 80s and 90s music – begins its
  seventh edition this weekend as part of the Brisbane festival. Dee Jefferson
  gets into the groove. Sport US Open | Alex de Minaur has been beaten by
  Canada’s Felix Auger Aliassime in their US Open quarter-final. Our live blog
  followed the action. Athletics | Teenage sprint sensation Gout Gout could
  still be growing, according to his coach, as he bids to emulate Usain Bolt in
  more than just his running style. AFL | After a series of controversial
  matches, the rivalry between the Crows and Magpies comes to a head in
  tonight’s qualifying final at the Adelaide Oval. Media roundup Reformed
  extremists tell the Courier Mail before today’s antisemitism summit in
  Brisbane that disinformation campaigns and foreign-backed propaganda are now

  cited by the Sydney Morning Herald. Melbourne has given up on proper
