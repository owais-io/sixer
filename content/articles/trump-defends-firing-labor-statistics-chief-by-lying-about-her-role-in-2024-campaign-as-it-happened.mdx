  This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the
  week. We will be back on Monday, once Donald Trump has concluded another long
  weekend of golfing. Here are the latest developments: US stocks slumped as
  Donald Trump unveiled new import tariffs on dozens of trading partners and a
  surprisingly weak jobs report spooked investors. Trump responded to new data
  showing that there were 258,000 fewer jobs created since May than previously
  estimated by firing the commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics, Erika
  McEntarfer. He then defended his decision by inventing an entirely false
  accusation that the fired economist had released false job numbers days before
  the 2024 election. The president repeated this lie several times. Bill Beach,
  a former Heritage foundation economist who was picked by Trump in 2018 to
  oversee labor statistics, denounced what he called the “totally groundless
  firing” of his successor. En route to his New Jersey golf club for the eighth
  time in six months, Trump cut off a reporter as soon as he said the words
  “Jeffrey Epstein” and moved away. Those who have not seen it, and are
  interested in the questions surrounding the death in federal custody of
  Epstein, the late sex offender who socialized with Trump for more than a
  decade, should watch this CBS News visual analysis of the jailhouse video
  released by Trump’s justice department. En route to another long weekend of
  golf on Friday, Donald Trump cut off a reporter as soon as he said the words
  “Jeffrey Epstein” and moved away from him. The interaction was captured on
  video streamed by the White House on YouTube, as Trump took questions from
  reporters gathered outside to watch him depart by helicopter. “Why did it take
  seven years, seven years”, the reporter began, “from the time that you learned
  that people were being stolen from Mar-a-Lago to the time that you kicked,
  that you took Jeffrey Epstein-” “Yeah, I don’t understand your question,”
  Trump interjected as the reporter tried to finish asking it, saying “off the
  members”. The president by then had stepped away and called on a different
  reporter to ask him another question. Although Trump has said on more than one
  occasion recently that he either could not hear or did not understand a
  question, he was surprisingly open to answering questions on his relationship
  with Epstein, the late sex offender, earlier in the week. On a flight back to
  Washington on Tuesday, after a family trip to Scotland, where he opened a golf
  course that was to have been named for his late mother, but was instead
  dedicated to him, Trump even revealed, while standing next to two of his
  grandchildren, that Epstein “stole” a 16-year-old spa attendant, Virginia
  Roberts Giuffre, by hiring her away from Mar-Lago. Court documents indicate
  that Giuffre was hired as Epstein’s personal masseuse by his former girlfriend
  Ghislaine Maxwell at the Mar-a-Lago spa in the summer of 2000. Giuffre, who
  died this year, alleged in court documents that she was first abused by
  Epstein and Maxwell together that year, and then “lent out to other powerful
  men”, including Prince Andrew. Trump maintained on Tuesday that he banned
  Epstein from the club soon after that, when he learned that he had hired away
  Giuffre and another club employee. But Sarah Blaskey, a Miami Herald
  investigative reporter, pointed out in her 2020 book on Mar-a-Lago that
  Epstein remained on the membership rolls of Mar-a-Lago until October 2007,
  more than a year after he had been arrested and charged with unlawful sex with
  a minor. It was apparently this discrepancy in Trump’s timeline that the
  president was unwilling to discuss on Friday. Why are the federal government’s
  monthly job reports on US employment revised so often? William Beach, a
  conservative economist who was Donald Trump’s hand-picked labor statistics
  commissioner during his first term, explained to CNN in January that the core
  problem, making initial estimates of job gains often inaccurate and subject to
  revision, is that the federal agency still relies on surveys, conducted
  in-person and over the phone, in an era when response rates have plummeted.
  “With lower response rates, our estimates are going to be more volatile, and
  our benchmark revisions (which typically factor in hard data sources such as
  tax records) are going to be greater,” Beach told the broadcaster. “With the
  larger revisions and the statistical system kind of on its heels, people are
  taking pot shots at the data,” Beach said days after Trumps’ second inaugural.
  “It’s very unfortunate that they’re doing it, and it’s being done left and
  right. It’s not a Republican or Democrat thing. It’s just politicians finding
  good targets.” Despite Beach’s both-sides framing, there is no doubt that when
  it comes to suggest that the government labor data is manipulated for partisan
  reasons, Trump is the Truther-in-chief. Trump has claimed this for years,
  frequently casting doubt on job numbers, and other economic data produced by
  the bureau of labor statistics, like inflation data and the Consumer Price
  Index (CPI). Just last week, Trump repeated the claim he has made since
  returning to office, that prices on “groceries are down”. In fact, the CPI
  shows that prices are up 0.6% since January. And when it comes to job reports,
  Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign that the Biden-Harris administration
  had been “caught fraudulently manipulating job statistics” when the bureau of
  labor statistics reported in August that new data showed that 818,000 fewer
  jobs had been created in the previous year than it had initially estimated.
  “New Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Administration
  PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER
  DID. The real Numbers are much worse than that,” Trump wrote on Truth Social
  the morning that revised data was released. The obvious flaw in Trump’s logic
  then was that the initial estimates he called fake and the downward revision
  he cited as evidence of that fakery were both produced by the same people: the
  team of over 2,000 economists, researchers and data scientists led by Erika
  McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics he fired on Friday for
  reporting another downward revision. As the University of Michigan economist
  Justin Wolfers observed on Friday: “When preliminary payrolls numbers
  overestimated job growth under Biden – and were later revised down – Trumpland
  claimed this was the BLS trying to prop up the President. Today he interprets
  it as the BLS is trying to undermine him.” Firing “the wonk in charge of the
  statisticians who track economic reality”, Wolfers added, “is an authoritarian
  four alarm fire. It will also backfire: you can’t bend economic reality, but
  you can break the trust of markets. And biased data yields worse policy.”
  Speaking to reporters on Friday, Donald Trump defended his decision to fire
  Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics, and falsely accused
  her of having released reports just before the 2024 election that overstated
  the number of new jobs created by the Biden-Harris administration. Asked by a
  reporter, “Why did you fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics?” Trump
  replied: “Because I think her numbers were wrong, just like I thought her
  numbers were wrong before the election.” The president then went on to give a
  wildly inaccurate account of the jobs data released by the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics in 2024. “Days before the election, she came out with these
  beautiful numbers for Kamala, I guess Biden-Kamala, and she came out with
  these beautiful numbers trying to get somebody else elected,” Trump said,
  entirely misrepresenting the jobs report released on 1 November 2024, four
  days before the election, which in fact showed the US added just 12,000 jobs
  over the previous month. At the time, the Trump campaign called the jobs
  report “a catastrophe” that “definitively reveals how badly Kamala Harris
  broke our economy”. On Friday, however, the president offered a very different
  account of that report released just nine months ago. “Then, right after the
  election,” Trump claimed, “she had an 8- or 900,000 dollar [sic] massive
  reduction, said she made a mistake.” What Trump was misremembering is a Bureau
  of Labor Statistics announcement, on 21 August 2024, that updated data showed
  that there had been 818,000 fewer jobs added in the US in the previous year
  than it had initially estimated. That downward revision was large, but part of
  an annual process, in which the bureau updates its initial estimates when it
  gets better data. The same day that revision was announced in 2024, Trump, who
  was then recalibrating his campaign to focus on Kamala Harris, posted on Truth
  Social that the Biden-Harris administration had been “caught fraudulently
  manipulating Job Statistics” and the “New Data from the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics shows that the Administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra
  818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID.” On Friday, however, Trump
  repeatedly insisted that the August revision had not come until after the
  November election. Before leaving for another long weekend of golf, Trump
  repeated his false claim about McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor
  statistics he just fired, to another reporter. “Before the election,” Trump
  recalled, wrongly, “she gave out numbers that were so good for the Democrats,
  it was like unbelievable.” “And then right after the election, she corrected
  those numbers with, I think, almost 900,000 correction,” he said, referring
  incorrectly to the revision that had taken place in August and had been a boon
  to his campaign. “Well today she did the same thing, with the 253,000,
  whatever the number was,” Trump added, referring to McEntarfer’s last act of
  office: Friday’s announcement that the US economy added 258,000 fewer jobs in
  May and June than previously estimated. Bill Beach, a former Heritage
  foundation economist who was picked by Donald Trump in 2018 to oversee labor
  statistics, denounced on Friday what he called the “totally groundless firing
  of Dr Erika McEntarfer, my successor as Commissioner of Labor Statistics at
  BLS”. Beach added that Trump’s order to remove the bearer of bad news on jobs
  “sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the
  Bureau”. He also co-signed a statement with Erica Groshen, who served as the
  commissioner before him, from 2013 to 2017, which began: Today, President
  Trump called into question the integrity of the Employment Situation report
  that the BLS released this morning. He accused BLS Commissioner Erika
  McEntarfer of deliberately reporting false numbers to reflect poorly on this
  administration. This baseless, damaging claim undermines the valuable work and
  dedication of BLS staff who produce the reports each month. This escalates the
  President’s unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the
  federal statistical system. The President seeks to blame someone for unwelcome
  economic news. The Commissioner does not determine what the numbers are but
  simply reports on what the data show. The process of obtaining the numbers is
  decentralized by design to avoid opportunities for interference. The BLS uses
  the same proven, transparent, reliable process to produce estimates every
  month. Every month, BLS revises the prior two months’ employment estimates to
  reflect slower-arriving, more-accurate information. This rationale for firing
  Dr McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal
  economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic
  decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers. US official
  statistics are the gold standard globally. When leaders of other nations have
  politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official
  statistics and in government science. Other experts and elected officials were
  equally scathing in their response to Trump’s move. “This will make it
  difficult to trust government sources on economic and financial data,” Rohit
  Chopra, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
  wrote. “Many businesses and investors use these data sets to determine where
  they want to launch or grow, so this will have real costs.” “Instead of
  helping people get good jobs, Donald Trump just fired the statistician who
  reported bad jobs data that the wanna-be king doesn’t like,” Elizabeth Warren,
  the Massachusetts senator and bankruptcy law expert, posted. “No. Mr.
  President,” Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, wrote. “In America, you do
  not fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for releasing a jobs
  report that you don’t like. That’s what authoritarians do. We need serious
  economists in these positions, not hacks who will only tell you what you want
  to hear.” US stocks slumped on Friday, with the S&amp;P on track for its
  biggest daily percentage decline in more than three months as Donald Trump
  unveiled new import tariffs on dozens of trading partners and a surprisingly
  weak jobs report spurred selling pressure. Shares in Amazon also fell after
  the company failed to meet expectations for its Amazon Web Services cloud
  computing unit. Just hours before Trump’s latest self-imposed tariff deadline
  on Friday, the president signed executive orders imposing import taxes on
  goods imported from around the globe, including key trading partners such as
  Canada, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the 27-nation European
  Union. Investor confidence was also hit by new data showing that US job growth
  slowed more than expected in July, and was significantly lower than previously
  reported in May and June. Those job numbers prompted Trump to fire the
  messenger, commissioner of labor statistics Erika McEntarfer. The jobs report
  significantly pushed up expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut
  interest rates at its next meeting in September. According to preliminary
  data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 101.60 points, or 1.60%, to end at 6,237.79 points,
  while the Nasdaq Composite fell 472.78 points, or 2.24%, to 20,649.67. The Dow
  Jones industrial average lost 543.97 points, or 1.23%, to close at 43,587.01.
  Donald Trump said he had ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in
  “appropriate regions” in response to “highly provocative statements” from
  former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who said yesterday that the US
  president should remember Moscow had Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities.
  It comes amid a spiralling war of words with Medvedev as tensions rise over
  Trump’s efforts to get Russia to end its war in Ukraine or face economic
  sanctions. Medvedev had earlier said that Trump’s threats to sanction Russia
  and a recent ultimatum were “a threat and a step towards war”. Leaders of more
  than 60 countries were plunged into a fresh race to secure trade deals with
  the US after Trump unleashed global chaos with sweeping new tariff rates last
  night. Our story is here and a table of all the tariff rates for each country
  is here. Trump ordered the firing of the federal government official in charge
  of labor statistics, hours after data revealed jobs growth stalled this
  summer, prompting accusations that he is “firing the messenger”. In a Truth
  Social post, Trump claimed (with no evidence) that Erika McEntarfer had
  “faked” employment figures in the run-up to last year’s election, in a bid to
  boost Kamala Harris’s chances of victory, and implied she “manipulated”
  today’s numbers for political reasons. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have
  directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will
  be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,” Trump wrote. The
  Bureau of Labor Statistics released revised job stats today which showed the
  US economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, far lower than expected, amid
  ongoing concerns with Trump’s escalating trade war. In the report, the BLS
  also slashed the number of jobs added in May, revising the figure down by
  125,000, from 144,000 to only 19,000, and in June, which was revised down by
  133,000, from 147,000 to just 14,000 – a combined 258,000 fewer jobs than
  previously reported. Trump also said once again that Federal Reserve chair,
  Jerome Powell, should also be “put out to pasture”, as he continued to insist
  the US economy is booming on his watch and implore the Fed to lower interest
  rates. The Fed later announced that Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler
  will resign from the central bank’s board as of 8 August, leaving a key
  vacancy for Trump to fill ahead of schedule. Ghislaine Maxwell was “routinely
  moved” to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Texas, a senior
  administration official has told NBC News, due to safety concerns. “Any false
  assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd.
  Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and
  danger concerns,” the official said of Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice, who is
  serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes. She has
  appealed to the supreme court to overturn her conviction. Continuing his
  attacks and baseless claims that the employment figures released today were
  “manipulated” for political reasons, Trump said the numbers were “rigged” to
  make him and his party look bad. He wrote on Truth Social: In my opinion,
  today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME,
  look bad – Just like when they had three great days around the 2024
  Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were ‘taken away’ on November
  15, 2024, right after the Election, when the Jobs Numbers were massively
  revised DOWNWARD, making a correction of over 818,000 Jobs — A TOTAL SCAM.
  Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell is no better! But, the good news is, our Country is
  doing GREAT! The Federal Reserve has announced that Adriana D Kugler will step
  down early from her position as governor of the Federal Reserve Board on 8
  August. Her term was due to expire in January, but her early resignation gives
  Donald Trump an opportunity to more quickly appoint someone who could
  eventually replace Jerome Powell as chair. In a speech earlier this month, the
  New York Times notes that Kugler said the Fed should not cut interest rates
  “for some time” as tariffs trickle through to consumer prices. Responding to
  Ghislaine Maxwell’s move to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Texas, a
  senior administration official has told NBC News that prisoners are “routinely
  moved” due to safety concerns. “Any false assertion this individual was given
  preferential treatment is absurd. Prisoners are routinely moved in some
  instances due to significant safety and danger concerns,” the official said of
  Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice. In a statement earlier today responding to
  Maxwell’s move from a Florida facility to the one in Texas, the family of
  Virginia Giuffre, along with Maxwell and Epstein accusers Annie and Maria
  Farmer, said: It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential
  treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. The New
  York Times (paywall) notes that the Senate confirmed Erika McEntarfer to the
  post of commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024 in an
  overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. Among her supporters at the time was then
  senator and now vice-president JD Vance. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Trump’s labor
  secretary, has said she “wholeheartedly” supports the president’s firing of
  Erika McEntarfer to “ensure the American People can trust the important and
  influential data coming from [the Bureau of Labor Statistics]”. Trump ordered
  McEntarfer’s firing hours after data revealed that jobs growth had stalled
  this summer and administration officials scrambled to explain the lackluster
  report. “A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised
  concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor
  Commissioner,” Chavez-DeRemer wrote in a post on X. She said William
  Wiatrowski, the deputy commissioner, would serve as acting commissioner during
  the search for McEntarfer’s replacement. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,
  may call a special election in November to begin the process of redrawing the
  state’s congressional maps in response to Texas’s plans to change their own
  maps to help Republicans keep their majority in the House of Representatives.
  Donald Trump is pushing Texas and other Republican-dominated states to carry
  out mid-decade redistricting that will favor the GOP and potentially stop
  Democrats from retaking control of the House in next year’s midterm elections.
  Governors in Democratic-led states have responded by warning they will move to
  redo their own maps if Texas goes ahead with its plans, which could create an
  additional five Republican-leaning districts. California is viewed as the best
  opportunity for Democrats to pick up seats through gerrymandering, but voters
  will first have to approve changes to an independent redistricting commission
  that was given the power to draw congressional districts in 2010. Speaking at
  a Thursday press conference, Newsom said “a special election would be called,
  likely to be the first week of November” to approve the changes. “We will go
  to the people of this state in a transparent way and ask them to consider the
  new circumstances, to consider these new realities,” the governor added. The
  party out of power typically regains control of the House in a president’s
  first midterm election, as the Republicans did under Biden in 2022 and Obama
  in 2010, and Democrats did during Trump’s first term in 2018. Newsom argued
  that another two years of unified Republican control of Congress would be
  especially harmful for California, noting that Los Angeles residents were
  still waiting for lawmakers to approve aid from the wildfires that ravaged the
  region earlier this year. “They’re doing a midterm rejection of objectivity
  and independence, an act that we could criticize from the sideline, or an act
  that we can respond to in kind – fight fire with fire,” Newsom said. While
  Republicans could gain the most seats by redrawing Texas’s maps, Ohio, another
  red state, must also redraw its maps before next year’s election, and there’s
  talk of redistricting to the GOP’s advantage in Missouri and Indiana.
  Democrats are seen as having a more difficult path to improving their odds of
  winning the House majority through redistricting, often due to their states’
  embrace of independent commissions intended to draw fair congressional amps.
  Voters created the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008 to
  draw its legislative maps, and in 2010 expanded its powers to congressional
  districts. Newsom said, “We’re not here to eliminate the commission,” but
  rather to respond to what he described as “the rigging of the system by the
  president of the United States. “And it won’t just happen in Texas. I imagine
  he’s making similar calls all across this country. It’s a big deal. I don’t
  think it gets much bigger,” Newsom said. In the same Truth Social post, Trump
  said Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell should also be “put out to pasture”,
  as he continued to insist the US economy is booming on his watch. The Economy
  is BOOMING under ‘TRUMP’ despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with
  Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before
  the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting ‘Kamala’ elected –
  How did that work out? Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell should also be put ‘out to
  pasture’. Donald Trump has said he’s ordered the firing of Erika McEntarfer,
  the commissioner of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, hours after data showed
  US employment growth was weaker than expected for the last few months.
  McEntarfer was nominated by former president Joe Biden to serve in the role in
  2023 and was confirmed by the US Senate the following year. In a Truth Social
  post, Trump suggested (with no evidence) McEntarfer had “faked” the employment
  figures in the run-up to last year’s election, in a bid to boost Kamala
  Harris’s chances of victory, and implied she “manipulated” the numbers for
  political reasons. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to
  fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with
  someone much more competent and qualified,” Trump wrote. “Important numbers
  like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political
  purposes.” The bureau released revised job stats today which showed the US
  economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, far lower than expected, amid ongoing
  concerns with Trump’s escalating trade war. In the report, the BLS also
  slashed the number of jobs added in May, revising the figure down by 125,000,
  from 144,000 to only 19,000, and June, which was revised down by 133,000, from
  147,000 to just 14,000 – a combined 258,000 fewer jobs than previously
  reported. Here is my colleague Andrew Roth’s report: Donald Trump has said
  that he has deployed nuclear-capable submarines to the “appropriate regions”
  in response to a threatening tweet by Russia’s former president Dmitry
  Medvedev, suggesting that he would be ready to launch a nuclear strike as
  tensions rise over the war in Ukraine. In a post on Truth Social on Friday,
  Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the nuclear submarines because
  of “highly provocative statements” by Medvedev, noting he is now the deputy
  chairman of Russia’s security council. Medvedev had earlier said that Trump’s
  threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum were “a threat and a step
  towards war”. Donald Trump also continues to voice his frustration over the
  war Russia continues to wage in Ukraine, writing on Truth Social earlier
  (before the submarine announcement): I have just been informed that almost
  20,000 Russian soldiers died this month in the ridiculous War with Ukraine.
  Russia has lost 112,500 soldiers since the beginning of the year. That is a
  lot of unnecessary DEATH! Ukraine, however, has also suffered greatly. They
  have lost approximately 8,000 soldiers since January 1, 2025, and that number
  does not include their missing. Ukraine has also lost civilians, but in
  smaller numbers, as Russian rockets crash into Kyiv, and other Ukrainian
  locales. This is a War that should have never happened — This is Biden’s War,
  not ‘TRUMP’s.’ I’m just here to see if I can stop it! As Trump and Medvedev
  have traded taunts in recent days following Trump saying on Tuesday that
  Russia had “10 days from today” to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or be hit,
  along with its oil buyers, with tariffs, Moscow has shown no sign that it will
  comply with Trump’s deadline. As my colleague Shaun Walker reports from Kyiv,
  Vladimir Putin has not responded to Trump’s ultimatum. He has claimed he wants
  a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but has given no indication that he is
  willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian
  missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine. “We
  need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both
  Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,” said
  Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before Trump’s new deadline
  for hostilities to cease. Trump has said if Russia and Ukraine do not come to
  an agreement to end the war by next Friday, 8 August, he will impose a package
  of economic sanctions on Russia. Per my last post, Medvedev on Monday accused
  Trump of engaging in a “game of ultimatums” and reminded him that Russia
  possessed Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort after Trump
  told Medvedev to “watch his words”. Medvedev has emerged as one of the
  Kremlin’s most outspoken anti-western hawks since Putin sent tens of thousands
  of troops to launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Reuters notes
  that while Kremlin critics deride him as an irresponsible loose cannon, some
  western diplomats say his statements illustrate the thinking in senior Kremlin
  policymaking circles. The Associated Press also notes that with his frequently
  wielded nuclear threats and lobbing of insults at western leaders on social
  media, some observers have argued that Medvedev is seeking to score political
  points with Putin and Russian military hawks with his extravagant rhetoric.
  The escalation from Trump comes amid a spiralling war of words with the former
  Russian president over Trump’s efforts to get Russia to end its war in
  Ukraine. Trump yesterday called Medvedev a “failed former president”, writing
  on Truth Social that he should “watch his words” and is “entering very
  dangerous territory”. Russia and the USA do almost no business together. Let’s
  keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia,
  who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very
  dangerous territory! Medvedev, who was prime minister of Russia from 2012 to
  2020 and is a very vocal supporter of its invasion of Ukraine, has ridiculed
  Trump’s ultimatum to the Kremlin to reach a peace deal. He wrote on X earlier
  this week: Trump’s playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10 … He
  should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn’t Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new
  ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine,
  but with his own country. Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road! In another post
  on X, Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, called US
  senator Lindsey Graham “gramps”, after he told him to “get to the peace
  table”. It’s not for you or Trump to dictate when to ‘get at the peace table’.
  Negotiations will end when all the objectives of our military operation have
  been achieved. Work on America first, gramps! The jabs continued on Telegram,
  where Medvedev threatened Trump with a cold war-era doomsday weapon known as
  the “Dead Hand” – a Russian nuclear system designed to automatically launch a
  retaliatory strike. If a few words from a former Russian president can cause
  such a nervous reaction from the supposedly powerful President of the United
  States, then clearly Russia is right about everything and will continue its
  own way. And as for the ‘dead economies’ of India and Russia and ‘stepping
  into dangerous territory’ – well, let him recall his favorite movies about the
  ‘walking dead,’ as well as how dangerous the supposedly non-existent ‘Dead
  Hand’ can be. Donald Trump has said he had ordered two nuclear submarines to
  be positioned in “appropriate regions” in response to threats from former
  Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who said on Thursday that Trump should
  remember Moscow had Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities. Trump said in a
  post on Truth Social: Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former
  President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the
  Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear
  Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these
  foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that. Words are very
  important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not
  be one of those instances. Thank you for your attention to this matter! The
  Canadian team working on a trade deal with the US could walk away from talks
  in the wake of Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 35% tariff on some goods
  from Canada, an adviser to that country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said on
  Friday. Flavio Volpe, a member of Carney’s hand-picked Council on Canada-US
  Relations, told CBC News that the negotiators would stay in Washington for the
  time being. Yesterday, Trump signed an executive order increasing tariffs on
  Canadian goods to 35% from 25% on all products not covered by the
  US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. The White House cited what it said was
  Canada’s failure to stop fentanyl smuggling and a failure to address US
  concerns about trade barriers. Trump has also cited Carney’s plan to recognize
  a Palestinian state in September as making it “very hard” to reach a deal.
  “Team Canada is still in Washington working on a deal and they’re going to be
  there until we either have a conclusion of a good deal for Canada or that it’s
  time to take a pause and walk away,” said Volpe, president of Canada’s
  national Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. Carney wants a new deal
  to reset bilateral relations, saying Trump’s move to impose tariffs had
  irrevocably upended the decades-old trading and security ties between the two
  neighbors. The talks though have so far produced little. Washington is also
  unhappy about Canada’s refusal to drop its own Trudeau-era countermeasures. In
  June, Carney had threatened to ramp up counter-tariffs in July unless there
  was progress on the deal. A statement he issued early today did not mention
  retaliation at all. Brian Clow, a senior Trudeau aide who was in charge of US
  relations inside the prime minister’s office for several years, noted that
  Trump had announced a number of deals with nations that declined to impose
  counter-tariffs. “Unfortunately, Canada stands on its own right now, along
  with China, because many other countries around the world refused to stand up
  to this President,” he told Reuters. “So I’m not sure that further retaliation
  is the way to go here.” The offices of Carney and Dominic LeBlanc, the federal
  cabinet minister leading the Canadian team in Washington, were not immediately
  available for comment. Kamala Harris has said that she currently has no desire
  to re-enter “the system” of American politics because it is “broken”. Last
  night the Democratic party’s defeated presidential nominee, who replaced Joe
  Biden late in the 2024 campaign after he dropped his re-election bid, gave her
  first interview since losing the election to Donald Trump, talking to Stephen
  Colbert on The Late Show. After she announced she will not run for the
  governorship of California just a day earlier, Harris told the TV show that it
  was about something more “basic” than whether she wanted to run for something
  else instead – with the subtext being whether she will attempt a White House
  run again in 2028. “Recently I made the decision that I just – for now – I
  don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken,” she said, provoking
  a collective groan from the studio audience. Colbert later returned to the
  subject, saying that her remark was harrowing. “Well, but it’s also evident,
  isn’t it?” she said. The former vice-president added: I always believed, that
  as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend
  our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that they’re not as
  strong as they need to be. And for now I don’t want to go back into that
  system. Harris’s choice of The Late Show as the channel for her first
  post-election defeat interview was pointed. The most-watched talkshow was
  cancelled last month by the CBS network, which pleaded financial stress,
  though the decision was widely denounced as being politically motivated. The
  cancellation was announced after Colbert had criticized CBS and its parent
  company, Paramount Global, for reaching a $16m settlement with Trump. The
  president had sued CBS News over an interview on the 60 Minutes show with
  Harris at the height of last year’s presidential campaign, which Trump claimed
  had been manipulated in her favour. None of this febrile backstory was
  mentioned by either Colbert or Harris on Thursday. But she did delivery a
  passionate lament for the numbers of people who she said had “capitulated” to
  the aggressive second Trump administration. When Colbert invited her to say “I
  told you so” after she had predicted many of Trump’s most contentious moves –
  including Medicaid cuts, ignoring court orders and “massive tax cuts to the
  rich” – she replied: “But Stephen, what I did not predict was the
  capitulation.” She went on: Perhaps it’s naive of me … There should be many
  who consider themselves to be guardians of our system and our democracy who
  just capitulated, and I didn’t see that coming. Americans are struggling
  financially, grappling with debt and the rising cost of living, and are
  blaming the Trump administration and corporate interests for worsening
  economic outlooks for working families, according to a new poll. Six out of 10
  Americans place blame on the Trump administration for driving up their cost of
  living, according to a poll conducted by Morning Consult for the Century
  Foundation, which asked 2,007 Americans how they are managing the high cost of
  living in the US economy, who they think is to blame and what are the
  solutions. The poll found 63% said Trump had had a negative impact on grocery
  prices, and 61% said he had had a negative impact on the cost of living.
  Nearly half, 49%, said the Trump administration had had a negative impact on
  their finances. Nearly eight out of 10 Americans, including 70% of
  Republicans, fear that Trump’s tariffs will increase the price of everyday
  goods. More than six out of 10 Americans said it had become more difficult to
  find a well-paying job, buy a home and afford childcare. Ghislaine Maxwell has
  been transferred from a Florida prison to a lower-security facility in Texas
  to continue serving her 20-year sentence, the US Bureau of Prisons said today.
  For Maxwell, an associate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the
  move from FCI Tallahassee, a low-security prison, to the federal prison camp
  in Bryan, Texas, comes a week after she met with deputy attorney general Todd
  Blanche, who said he wanted to speak with her about anyone else who may have
  been involved in Epstein’s crimes of trafficking underage girls. Maxwell’s
  lawyer David Markus confirmed that she was moved. The reason for the move
  isn’t immediately clear yet, but Maxwell is appealing her conviction to the
  supreme court. The Bureau of Prisons classifies prison camps such as Bryan as
  minimum-security institutions, the lowest of five security levels in the
  federal system. Such facilities have limited or no perimeter fencing.
  Low-security facilities such as FCI Tallahassee have double-fenced perimeters
  and higher staff-to-inmate ratios than camps, according to the bureau. The
  House oversight committee has said that it also wants to speak with Maxwell.
  Markus said Maxwell would be open to this but only if the panel gives her
  immunity from prosecution for anything she says. Democrats are launching a
  nationwide summer blitz designed to force vulnerable Republicans to defend
  Trump’s big tax and spending bill, especially Medicaid cuts. The Democratic
  National Committee’s “Organizing Summer” will feature events in Alaska, Texas,
  Colorado and California over the coming week. The party’s message will be
  reinforced by online advertising and billboard trucks at county fairs
  targeting House Republicans in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Jersey, among
  other states. The event aims to ensure that “Americans across the country know
  exactly who is responsible for taking away healthcare, food, construction jobs
  and nursing homes in order to give massive handouts to billionaires,” the
  chair of the DNC, Ken Martin, said. The package Trump signed into law on 4
  July may become the defining issue of next year’s midterm elections.
  Republican leaders encourage their members to promote more popular aspects of
  the law in appearances where they’re less likely to face difficult questions
  or protests. Thousands of license applications by US companies to export goods
  and technology around the globe, including to China, are in limbo because
  turmoil at the agency in charge of approving them has left it nearly
  paralyzed, reports Reuters. While the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick,
  has long touted Trump’s tariff and trade deals, sources said the export bureau
  under Lutnick’s command has failed to issue expected new rules, stifled
  communications with industry representatives, pushed out experts, and lost
  staff through buyouts and resignations. Shipments of artificial intelligence
  chips from tech giant Nvidia to China are the most high-profile example of
  licenses not being swiftly approved. The company said on 14 July that the
  government assured it licenses would be granted for its H20 chip, and it hoped
  to start deliveries soon. Lutnick and other officials confirmed sales would be
  allowed. But sources said this week no licenses have yet been issued, and
  billions of dollars of AI chip orders are at stake. One US official said the
  backlog of license applications is the lengthiest in more than three decades.
  The US Transportation Department said today that it is cancelling $26m in
  grants for a long-delayed proposed high-speed rail project between Washington
  and Baltimore. The USDOT said it was rescinding funds for the proposed $20bn
  Baltimore-Washington Superconducting Magnetic Levitation, or Maglev project,
  after “nearly a decade of poor planning, significant community opposition,
  tremendous cost overruns, and nothing to show for it”. An environmental review
  of the project has been on pause since 2021. Further to my earlier post,
  Donald Trump has (yet again) called on top Federal Reserve officials to seize
  control from its chair, Jerome Powell, if he fails to cut interest rates,
  stepping up his extraordinary attacks on the central bank’s independence. The
  US president called Powell “a stubborn MORON” in a series of critical social
  media posts on Friday, days after the Fed held rates steady for the fifth
  consecutive time. It comes as Trump faces heightened questions over the impact
  of his aggressive economic policy, and the White House presses forward with
  plans for a fresh wave of tariffs next week. Hours before the federal
  government released data which underlined a significant deterioration in the
  jobs market, Trump again broke with precedent to pin blame on the Fed – and
  urge it to change course. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell, a stubborn MORON, must
  substantially lower interest rates, NOW,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his
  social network. “IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL,
  AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!” The Fed chair does not
  unilaterally set interest rates, which are decided by its rate-setting federal
  open market committee. Presidents typically respect its independence, leaving
  the central bank to make an objective decision – without political
  interference – about the best policy on interest rates for the US economy.
  Some countries received a reprieve from Donald Trump when he announced
  sweeping new levies yesterday. Lesotho was facing 50% tariffs on 2 April, an
  existential threat to its textile industry, but came out on Friday with a 15%
  rate. That should make it easier for manufacturers in Lesotho – which last
  month declared a national state of disaster over the country’s “high rates of
  youth unemployment and job losses” – to sell their goods to American
  consumers. That’s a relief for a nation which Trump said “nobody has ever
  heard of” when he halted USAID earlier this year. Also getting a drastic
  reduction in tariffs are Madagascar, down from 47% on 2 April to 15% on 1
  August, and Botswana, down from 37% to 15%. Liechtenstein, the wealthy
  European state best known as a financial centre, has seen rates slashed from
  37% to 15%, while the Falkland Islands have gone from 41% to 10%. Cambodia
  went from 49% to 19%, while Iraq only got a four-point reduction, from 39% to
  35%. Democratic lawmakers have slammed Trump’s “reckless and chaotic” tariff
  policies and federal cuts after today’s weak jobs report revealed that 258,000
  fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously thought. Senate
  minority leader Chuck Schumer said on X: The chickens are coming home to roost
  for Trump, and American families are paying the price. His reckless and
  chaotic tariffs and his drastic cuts are catching up with the economy which
  means fewer jobs and more people out of work. Trump must end his trade war and
  reverse his horrible cuts now. California governor Gavin Newsom wrote: A July
  jobs report way below expectations. May and June revised down as well.
  Unemployment rate ticked back up to 4.2%. We haven’t seen conditions like
  these since 2020. Don’t let Donald Trump gaslight you. He is failing Americans
  and crashing our economy. Kathy Hochul, New York’s governor, said: Donald
  Trump is killing jobs and jacking up prices with his tariffs. Sellout Stefanik
  calls his leadership a ‘masterclass.’ I call it bullshit. We will fight back.
  Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut wrote: Unsurprising bad jobs report. Just
  73,000 added in July, and most of those were health care. Even worse, May and
  June jobs numbers revised down by 258,000. Awful. Companies don’t want to
  create jobs in Trump’s chaos economy with weakening rule of law and rampant
  corruption. Representative Richard Neal, of Massachusetts, said: The American
  people didn’t ask for this. Hiring has stalled, prices are surging, and this
  administration is actively undermining the labor market Democrats rebuilt.
  This goes beyond failed Republican leadership, it’s actively making life
  harder for people. The main US stock indices have fallen sharply at the start
  of trading, as investors react to the flurry of tariffs announced last night
  and today’s weak US jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average (which
  contains 30 large US companies) has fallen by 1.1% at the start of trading,
  shedding 501 points to 43,629. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is down 1.2%,
  while the tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 1.5% – with Amazon falling almost 7%
  after issuing disappointing forecasts last night. The Swiss government is
  disappointed by the US tariffs imposed on Switzerland, president Karin
  Keller-Sutter has said, with the shock 39% figure much higher than expected –
  and one of the highest rates for any country. “The Federal Council is
  disappointed,” Keller-Sutter told Reuters on the sidelines of a Swiss national
  day event in Ruetli. “It is a pity that there is a tariff that is much higher
  than what we negotiated.” Although the pharmaceuticals sector was not included
  in the tariffs, the increased duties would have a “very bad” effect on the
  Swiss economy, she said. The government has already been in touch with
  Washington to find a solution, she added. The White House said on Friday that
  Switzerland is facing a higher 39% tariff rate on its exports because it
  refused to make “meaningful concessions” by dropping trade barriers with the
  US. “Switzerland, being one of the wealthiest, highest income countries on
  earth, cannot expect the United States to tolerate a one-sided trade
  relationship,” a White House official said. Here’s more on Canadian prime
  minister Mark Carney’s comments from earlier, when he said Ottawa is
  “disappointed” by the US decision to raise tariffs to 35% on Canadian goods
  not covered under a pre-existing US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. The US
  application of the USMCA treaty “means the US average tariff rate on Canadian
  goods remains one of its lowest for all of its trading partners”, Carney said.
  “Other sectors of our economy – including lumber, steel, aluminium, and
  automobiles – are, however, heavily impacted by US duties and tariffs,” Carney
  said. “For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian
  jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversify
  our export markets.” He also criticized Trump’s justification for raising the
  tariffs. “Canada accounts for only 1% of US fentanyl imports and has been
  working intensively to further reduce these volumes,” Carney said. Trump has
  long complained about a “flood” of fentanyl” coming from the north. He also
  said earlier this week that it would be “very hard” to make a trade deal with
  Canada after Carney’s announcement that he plans to join other countries in
  recognizing a Palestinian state. “Canada will be our own best customer,”
  Carney went on. “We can give ourselves more than any foreign government can
  ever take away by building with Canadian workers and by using Canadian
  resources to benefit all Canadians.” Here’s Carney’s full statement: Donald
  Trump has again repeated his plea for the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell
  to cut interest rates. Shortly after today’s weak jobs report was released,
  Trump posted on his Truth Social site: Too Little, Too Late. Jerome “Too Late”
  Powell is a disaster. DROP THE RATE! The good news is that Tariffs are
  bringing Billions of Dollars into the USA! The US dollar is being hammered on
  the foreign exchange markets, following the news that employment growth across
  America has been much weaker than previously thought over the last three
  months – a sign that the US labor market may be cooling. The latest non-farm
  payroll, just released, shows that US employment rose by just 73,000 in July,
  rather weaker than the 110,000 new jobs expected. But the big shock comes in
  the latest revisions to payrolls, with previous estimates for both May and
  June being revised sharply lower. The Bureau of Labor Statistics now estimates
  that just 19,000 new jobs were created in May, 125,000 fewer than the 144,000
  previously estimated. June’s data has been revised down too - showing that
  just 14,000 new jobs were created, not the 147,000 reported a month ago. That
  means 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously thought.
  The US unemployment rate has risen to 4.2% from 4.1% in June. This
  surprisingly weak data may be a sign that Trump’s trade wars, and the
  associated uncertainty, have cause more damage to the US economy than
  previously thought. There could also be an impact from cost-cutting Doge
  program pushed by Elon Musk. Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has visited
  Gaza today and been shown one of the controversial aid sites around which
  Israeli forces have killed hundreds of Palestinian people waiting for aid.
  Witkoff, the US president’s special envoy for the Middle East, had earlier met
  with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid mounting international
  horror over starvation in Gaza that follows months of Israeli-imposed aid
  restrictions. The visit to the site in Rafah by Witkoff – a former real estate
  lawyer with no foreign policy or humanitarian background, who has also met
  Vladimir Putin on Trump’s behalf – was reported by a number Israeli media
  organisations and comes as Human Rights Watch on Friday described the aid
  sites run by the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – as
  “death traps” that had become the scene of regular “bloodbaths”. The UN has
  said almost nine hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces
  attempting to reach the sites. According to the White House, the visit by
  Witkoff, accompanied by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, was aimed
  at finding ways to speed deliveries to Gaza. “The special envoy and the
  ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a
  final plan for food and aid distribution into the region,” the White House
  press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters. Trump on Thursday called
  the situation in Gaza “a terrible thing” when asked about comments from his
  ally and Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who became the
  first GOP lawmaker to call Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory a
  genocide. “Oh, it’s terrible what’s occurring there, yeah, it’s a terrible
  thing. People are very hungry,” Trump told reporters when asked about Greene’s
  social media comments, while also saying Washington had given financial
  assistance to address the hunger crisis in Gaza. My colleagues have created a
  searchable table of the countries and the “reciprocal” tariffs they face. The
  rates, which range from 41% for Syria to 10% for the UK, can be found in the
  table via the link below. A quick summary. Stock markets in Europe and across
  Asia-Pacific countries have fallen after Donald Trump announced new tariffs on
  dozens of US trading partners. Last night, as the latest deadline to reach
  deals approached, Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging
  from 10% to 41%. Rates were set at 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for
  South Africa ahead of the US president’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August for
  striking trade deals with countries worldwide. Trump also extended the
  deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico by another 90 days. Share prices
  have weakened in response – with Germany’s DAX down 1.9% and France’s CAC
  losing 2.2%, as European stock markets fell to a one-month low. Asia-Pacific
  stock markets were on track for their worst week since April, with Japan’s
  Nikkei 225 losing 0.6%, South Africa’s stock market is now down almost 1.5%.
  Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said he was disappointed that Donald
  Trump was raising its tariffs from 25% to 35%. And there was shock in
  Switzerland, which has been lumbered with a 39% tariff rate – which
  manufacturers fear will lead to job losses. You can follow more on our
  business live blog: Cambodia’s prime minister has praised the new tariff rate
  and said it is good news for the nation’s economic development. Prime minister
  Hun Manet said in a statement posted to Facebook late on Thursday night that
  “this is the best news for the people and economy of Cambodia to continue to
  develop the country.” “The United States has decided to reduce the tax on
  goods imported from Cambodia to the United States by 19% (down 30% compared to
  the initial tax rate of 49%),” Manet wrote in a translation of the post. This
  comes after Donald Trump had originally threatened a 49% tariff on Cambodia as
  part of his “Liberation Day” measures, but cut it to 36% last month. India is
  engaged with further trade talks with the US, a source said on Friday. This
  comes after Donald Trump signed an order imposing a 25% tariff on New Delhi’s
  export. “We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries
  have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to
  move forward,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday.
  Previously, trade talks between Washington and New Delhi have been bogged down
  by issues including access to India’s highly protected agriculture and dairy
  sector. Trump set steep import duties on dozens of trading partners, including
  a 35% tariff on many goods from Canada, 50% for Brazil, 20% for Taiwan and 39%
  for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order. Good morning and
  welcome to our rolling coverage of US politics as Donald Trump has signed an
  executive order ranging from 10% to 41% on imports from dozens of trade
  partners in his latest attempt to reshape the global economy. The order
  applies to 68 countries and the 27-member European Union. Rates were set at
  25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan, 19% for Thailand and 15% for
  South Korea. It includes an executive order to increase tariffs on Canadian
  goods imported to the US from 25% to 35%. He cited Canada’s failure to curb
  fentanyl smuggling across the border as a reason for why. Canadian prime
  minister Mark Carney said in a statement that he is “disappointed” by the
  announcement, then said Canada accounts for just 1% of US fentanyl imports.
  Carney also said that Canada remains committed to the US-Mexico-Canada
  Agreement. He closed the statement by saying that Canadians will be their “own
  best customer”. “We can give ourselves more than any foreign government can
  ever take away by building with Canadian workers and by using Canadian
  resources to benefit all Canadians,” it reads. We’ll be bringing you all the
  developments on this story today. In other news: World stock rates have
  fallen. Germany’s DAX index has dropped by 1.1% at the start of trading in
  Frankfurt, while France’s CAC fell by almost 1% and Spain’s IBEX lost 0.6% –
  even though Europe reached a trade deal with the US at the start of this week.
  Historian Rashid Khalidi has cancelled plans to teach this fall at Columbia
  University in response to the school’s recent agreement with the Trump
  administration. A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration’s
  plans and extended temporary protected status (TPS) for 60,000 people from
  Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.
  The US dollar has hit its highest level in two months against a basket of
  currencies today. The dollar index has risen by 0.1%, on track for its seventh
  daily rise in a row.

This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the week. We will be back on Monday, once Donald Trump has concluded another long weekend of golfing. Here are the latest developments: US stocks slumped as Donald Trump unveiled new import tariffs on dozens of trading partners and a surprisingly weak jobs report spooked investors. Trump responded to new data showing that there were 258,000 fewer jobs created since May than previously estimated by firing the commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer. He then defended his decision by inventing an entirely false accusation that the fired economist had released false job numbers days before the 2024 election. The president repeated this lie several times. Bill Beach, a former Heritage foundation economist who was picked by Trump in 2018 to oversee labor statistics, denounced what he called the “totally groundless firing” of his successor. En route to his New Jersey golf club for the eighth time in six months, Trump cut off a reporter as soon as he said the words “Jeffrey Epstein” and moved away. Those who have not seen it, and are interested in the questions surrounding the death in federal custody of Epstein, the late sex offender who socialized with Trump for more than a decade, should watch this CBS News visual analysis of the jailhouse video released by Trump’s justice department. En route to another long weekend of golf on Friday, Donald Trump cut off a reporter as soon as he said the words “Jeffrey Epstein” and moved away from him. The interaction was captured on video streamed by the White House on YouTube, as Trump took questions from reporters gathered outside to watch him depart by helicopter. “Why did it take seven years, seven years”, the reporter began, “from the time that you learned that people were being stolen from Mar-a-Lago to the time that you kicked, that you took Jeffrey Epstein-” “Yeah, I don’t understand your question,” Trump interjected as the reporter tried to finish asking it, saying “off the members”. The president by then had stepped away and called on a different reporter to ask him another question. Although Trump has said on more than one occasion recently that he either could not hear or did not understand a question, he was surprisingly open to answering questions on his relationship with Epstein, the late sex offender, earlier in the week. On a flight back to Washington on Tuesday, after a family trip to Scotland, where he opened a golf course that was to have been named for his late mother, but was instead dedicated to him, Trump even revealed, while standing next to two of his grandchildren, that Epstein “stole” a 16-year-old spa attendant, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, by hiring her away from Mar-Lago. Court documents indicate that Giuffre was hired as Epstein’s personal masseuse by his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell at the Mar-a-Lago spa in the summer of 2000. Giuffre, who died this year, alleged in court documents that she was first abused by Epstein and Maxwell together that year, and then “lent out to other powerful men”, including Prince Andrew. Trump maintained on Tuesday that he banned Epstein from the club soon after that, when he learned that he had hired away Giuffre and another club employee. But Sarah Blaskey, a Miami Herald investigative reporter, pointed out in her 2020 book on Mar-a-Lago that Epstein remained on the membership rolls of Mar-a-Lago until October 2007, more than a year after he had been arrested and charged with unlawful sex with a minor. It was apparently this discrepancy in Trump’s timeline that the president was unwilling to discuss on Friday. Why are the federal government’s monthly job reports on US employment revised so often? William Beach, a conservative economist who was Donald Trump’s hand-picked labor statistics commissioner during his first term, explained to CNN in January that the core problem, making initial estimates of job gains often inaccurate and subject to revision, is that the federal agency still relies on surveys, conducted in-person and over the phone, in an era when response rates have plummeted. “With lower response rates, our estimates are going to be more volatile, and our benchmark revisions (which typically factor in hard data sources such as tax records) are going to be greater,” Beach told the broadcaster. “With the larger revisions and the statistical system kind of on its heels, people are taking pot shots at the data,” Beach said days after Trumps’ second inaugural. “It’s very unfortunate that they’re doing it, and it’s being done left and right. It’s not a Republican or Democrat thing. It’s just politicians finding good targets.” Despite Beach’s both-sides framing, there is no doubt that when it comes to suggest that the government labor data is manipulated for partisan reasons, Trump is the Truther-in-chief. Trump has claimed this for years, frequently casting doubt on job numbers, and other economic data produced by the bureau of labor statistics, like inflation data and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Just last week, Trump repeated the claim he has made since returning to office, that prices on “groceries are down”. In fact, the CPI shows that prices are up 0.6% since January. And when it comes to job reports, Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign that the Biden-Harris administration had been “caught fraudulently manipulating job statistics” when the bureau of labor statistics reported in August that new data showed that 818,000 fewer jobs had been created in the previous year than it had initially estimated. “New Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID. The real Numbers are much worse than that,” Trump wrote on Truth Social the morning that revised data was released. The obvious flaw in Trump’s logic then was that the initial estimates he called fake and the downward revision he cited as evidence of that fakery were both produced by the same people: the team of over 2,000 economists, researchers and data scientists led by Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics he fired on Friday for reporting another downward revision. As the University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers observed on Friday: “When preliminary payrolls numbers overestimated job growth under Biden – and were later revised down – Trumpland claimed this was the BLS trying to prop up the President. Today he interprets it as the BLS is trying to undermine him.” Firing “the wonk in charge of the statisticians who track economic reality”, Wolfers added, “is an authoritarian four alarm fire. It will also backfire: you can’t bend economic reality, but you can break the trust of markets. And biased data yields worse policy.” Speaking to reporters on Friday, Donald Trump defended his decision to fire Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics, and falsely accused her of having released reports just before the 2024 election that overstated the number of new jobs created by the Biden-Harris administration. Asked by a reporter, “Why did you fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics?” Trump replied: “Because I think her numbers were wrong, just like I thought her numbers were wrong before the election.” The president then went on to give a wildly inaccurate account of the jobs data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024. “Days before the election, she came out with these beautiful numbers for Kamala, I guess Biden-Kamala, and she came out with these beautiful numbers trying to get somebody else elected,” Trump said, entirely misrepresenting the jobs report released on 1 November 2024, four days before the election, which in fact showed the US added just 12,000 jobs over the previous month. At the time, the Trump campaign called the jobs report “a catastrophe” that “definitively reveals how badly Kamala Harris broke our economy”. On Friday, however, the president offered a very different account of that report released just nine months ago. “Then, right after the election,” Trump claimed, “she had an 8- or 900,000 dollar [sic] massive reduction, said she made a mistake.” What Trump was misremembering is a Bureau of Labor Statistics announcement, on 21 August 2024, that updated data showed that there had been 818,000 fewer jobs added in the US in the previous year than it had initially estimated. That downward revision was large, but part of an annual process, in which the bureau updates its initial estimates when it gets better data. The same day that revision was announced in 2024, Trump, who was then recalibrating his campaign to focus on Kamala Harris, posted on Truth Social that the Biden-Harris administration had been “caught fraudulently manipulating Job Statistics” and the “New Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID.” On Friday, however, Trump repeatedly insisted that the August revision had not come until after the November election. Before leaving for another long weekend of golf, Trump repeated his false claim about McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics he just fired, to another reporter. “Before the election,” Trump recalled, wrongly, “she gave out numbers that were so good for the Democrats, it was like unbelievable.” “And then right after the election, she corrected those numbers with, I think, almost 900,000 correction,” he said, referring incorrectly to the revision that had taken place in August and had been a boon to his campaign. “Well today she did the same thing, with the 253,000, whatever the number was,” Trump added, referring to McEntarfer’s last act of office: Friday’s announcement that the US economy added 258,000 fewer jobs in May and June than previously estimated. Bill Beach, a former Heritage foundation economist who was picked by Donald Trump in 2018 to oversee labor statistics, denounced on Friday what he called the “totally groundless firing of Dr Erika McEntarfer, my successor as Commissioner of Labor Statistics at BLS”. Beach added that Trump’s order to remove the bearer of bad news on jobs “sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau”. He also co-signed a statement with Erica Groshen, who served as the commissioner before him, from 2013 to 2017, which began: Today, President Trump called into question the integrity of the Employment Situation report that the BLS released this morning. He accused BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of deliberately reporting false numbers to reflect poorly on this administration. This baseless, damaging claim undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff who produce the reports each month. This escalates the President’s unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system. The President seeks to blame someone for unwelcome economic news. The Commissioner does not determine what the numbers are but simply reports on what the data show. The process of obtaining the numbers is decentralized by design to avoid opportunities for interference. The BLS uses the same proven, transparent, reliable process to produce estimates every month. Every month, BLS revises the prior two months’ employment estimates to reflect slower-arriving, more-accurate information. This rationale for firing Dr McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers. US official statistics are the gold standard globally. When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science. Other experts and elected officials were equally scathing in their response to Trump’s move. “This will make it difficult to trust government sources on economic and financial data,” Rohit Chopra, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, wrote. “Many businesses and investors use these data sets to determine where they want to launch or grow, so this will have real costs.” “Instead of helping people get good jobs, Donald Trump just fired the statistician who reported bad jobs data that the wanna-be king doesn’t like,” Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and bankruptcy law expert, posted. “No. Mr. President,” Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, wrote. “In America, you do not fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for releasing a jobs report that you don’t like. That’s what authoritarians do. We need serious economists in these positions, not hacks who will only tell you what you want to hear.” US stocks slumped on Friday, with the S&amp;P on track for its biggest daily percentage decline in more than three months as Donald Trump unveiled new import tariffs on dozens of trading partners and a surprisingly weak jobs report spurred selling pressure. Shares in Amazon also fell after the company failed to meet expectations for its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit. Just hours before Trump’s latest self-imposed tariff deadline on Friday, the president signed executive orders imposing import taxes on goods imported from around the globe, including key trading partners such as Canada, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the 27-nation European Union. Investor confidence was also hit by new data showing that US job growth slowed more than expected in July, and was significantly lower than previously reported in May and June. Those job numbers prompted Trump to fire the messenger, commissioner of labor statistics Erika McEntarfer. The jobs report significantly pushed up expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 101.60 points, or 1.60%, to end at 6,237.79 points, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 472.78 points, or 2.24%, to 20,649.67. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 543.97 points, or 1.23%, to close at 43,587.01. Donald Trump said he had ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in “appropriate regions” in response to “highly provocative statements” from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who said yesterday that the US president should remember Moscow had Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities. It comes amid a spiralling war of words with Medvedev as tensions rise over Trump’s efforts to get Russia to end its war in Ukraine or face economic sanctions. Medvedev had earlier said that Trump’s threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum were “a threat and a step towards war”. Leaders of more than 60 countries were plunged into a fresh race to secure trade deals with the US after Trump unleashed global chaos with sweeping new tariff rates last night. Our story is here and a table of all the tariff rates for each country is here. Trump ordered the firing of the federal government official in charge of labor statistics, hours after data revealed jobs growth stalled this summer, prompting accusations that he is “firing the messenger”. In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed (with no evidence) that Erika McEntarfer had “faked” employment figures in the run-up to last year’s election, in a bid to boost Kamala Harris’s chances of victory, and implied she “manipulated” today’s numbers for political reasons. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,” Trump wrote. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released revised job stats today which showed the US economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, far lower than expected, amid ongoing concerns with Trump’s escalating trade war. In the report, the BLS also slashed the number of jobs added in May, revising the figure down by 125,000, from 144,000 to only 19,000, and in June, which was revised down by 133,000, from 147,000 to just 14,000 – a combined 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. Trump also said once again that Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, should also be “put out to pasture”, as he continued to insist the US economy is booming on his watch and implore the Fed to lower interest rates. The Fed later announced that Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler will resign from the central bank’s board as of 8 August, leaving a key vacancy for Trump to fill ahead of schedule. Ghislaine Maxwell was “routinely moved” to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Texas, a senior administration official has told NBC News, due to safety concerns. “Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd. Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and danger concerns,” the official said of Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and other crimes. She has appealed to the supreme court to overturn her conviction. Continuing his attacks and baseless claims that the employment figures released today were “manipulated” for political reasons, Trump said the numbers were “rigged” to make him and his party look bad. He wrote on Truth Social: In my opinion, today’s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad – Just like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were ‘taken away’ on November 15, 2024, right after the Election, when the Jobs Numbers were massively revised DOWNWARD, making a correction of over 818,000 Jobs — A TOTAL SCAM. Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell is no better! But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT! The Federal Reserve has announced that Adriana D Kugler will step down early from her position as governor of the Federal Reserve Board on 8 August. Her term was due to expire in January, but her early resignation gives Donald Trump an opportunity to more quickly appoint someone who could eventually replace Jerome Powell as chair. In a speech earlier this month, the New York Times notes that Kugler said the Fed should not cut interest rates “for some time” as tariffs trickle through to consumer prices. Responding to Ghislaine Maxwell’s move to a minimum-security federal prison camp in Texas, a senior administration official has told NBC News that prisoners are “routinely moved” due to safety concerns. “Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd. Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and danger concerns,” the official said of Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice. In a statement earlier today responding to Maxwell’s move from a Florida facility to the one in Texas, the family of Virginia Giuffre, along with Maxwell and Epstein accusers Annie and Maria Farmer, said: It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. The New York Times (paywall) notes that the Senate confirmed Erika McEntarfer to the post of commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024 in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. Among her supporters at the time was then senator and now vice-president JD Vance. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Trump’s labor secretary, has said she “wholeheartedly” supports the president’s firing of Erika McEntarfer to “ensure the American People can trust the important and influential data coming from [the Bureau of Labor Statistics]”. Trump ordered McEntarfer’s firing hours after data revealed that jobs growth had stalled this summer and administration officials scrambled to explain the lackluster report. “A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,” Chavez-DeRemer wrote in a post on X. She said William Wiatrowski, the deputy commissioner, would serve as acting commissioner during the search for McEntarfer’s replacement. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, may call a special election in November to begin the process of redrawing the state’s congressional maps in response to Texas’s plans to change their own maps to help Republicans keep their majority in the House of Representatives. Donald Trump is pushing Texas and other Republican-dominated states to carry out mid-decade redistricting that will favor the GOP and potentially stop Democrats from retaking control of the House in next year’s midterm elections. Governors in Democratic-led states have responded by warning they will move to redo their own maps if Texas goes ahead with its plans, which could create an additional five Republican-leaning districts. California is viewed as the best opportunity for Democrats to pick up seats through gerrymandering, but voters will first have to approve changes to an independent redistricting commission that was given the power to draw congressional districts in 2010. Speaking at a Thursday press conference, Newsom said “a special election would be called, likely to be the first week of November” to approve the changes. “We will go to the people of this state in a transparent way and ask them to consider the new circumstances, to consider these new realities,” the governor added. The party out of power typically regains control of the House in a president’s first midterm election, as the Republicans did under Biden in 2022 and Obama in 2010, and Democrats did during Trump’s first term in 2018. Newsom argued that another two years of unified Republican control of Congress would be especially harmful for California, noting that Los Angeles residents were still waiting for lawmakers to approve aid from the wildfires that ravaged the region earlier this year. “They’re doing a midterm rejection of objectivity and independence, an act that we could criticize from the sideline, or an act that we can respond to in kind – fight fire with fire,” Newsom said. While Republicans could gain the most seats by redrawing Texas’s maps, Ohio, another red state, must also redraw its maps before next year’s election, and there’s talk of redistricting to the GOP’s advantage in Missouri and Indiana. Democrats are seen as having a more difficult path to improving their odds of winning the House majority through redistricting, often due to their states’ embrace of independent commissions intended to draw fair congressional amps. Voters created the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008 to draw its legislative maps, and in 2010 expanded its powers to congressional districts. Newsom said, “We’re not here to eliminate the commission,” but rather to respond to what he described as “the rigging of the system by the president of the United States. “And it won’t just happen in Texas. I imagine he’s making similar calls all across this country. It’s a big deal. I don’t think it gets much bigger,” Newsom said. In the same Truth Social post, Trump said Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell should also be “put out to pasture”, as he continued to insist the US economy is booming on his watch. The Economy is BOOMING under ‘TRUMP’ despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting ‘Kamala’ elected – How did that work out? Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell should also be put ‘out to pasture’. Donald Trump has said he’s ordered the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, hours after data showed US employment growth was weaker than expected for the last few months. McEntarfer was nominated by former president Joe Biden to serve in the role in 2023 and was confirmed by the US Senate the following year. In a Truth Social post, Trump suggested (with no evidence) McEntarfer had “faked” the employment figures in the run-up to last year’s election, in a bid to boost Kamala Harris’s chances of victory, and implied she “manipulated” the numbers for political reasons. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,” Trump wrote. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes.” The bureau released revised job stats today which showed the US economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, far lower than expected, amid ongoing concerns with Trump’s escalating trade war. In the report, the BLS also slashed the number of jobs added in May, revising the figure down by 125,000, from 144,000 to only 19,000, and June, which was revised down by 133,000, from 147,000 to just 14,000 – a combined 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. Here is my colleague Andrew Roth’s report: Donald Trump has said that he has deployed nuclear-capable submarines to the “appropriate regions” in response to a threatening tweet by Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that he would be ready to launch a nuclear strike as tensions rise over the war in Ukraine. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the nuclear submarines because of “highly provocative statements” by Medvedev, noting he is now the deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. Medvedev had earlier said that Trump’s threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum were “a threat and a step towards war”. Donald Trump also continues to voice his frustration over the war Russia continues to wage in Ukraine, writing on Truth Social earlier (before the submarine announcement): I have just been informed that almost 20,000 Russian soldiers died this month in the ridiculous War with Ukraine. Russia has lost 112,500 soldiers since the beginning of the year. That is a lot of unnecessary DEATH! Ukraine, however, has also suffered greatly. They have lost approximately 8,000 soldiers since January 1, 2025, and that number does not include their missing. Ukraine has also lost civilians, but in smaller numbers, as Russian rockets crash into Kyiv, and other Ukrainian locales. This is a War that should have never happened — This is Biden’s War, not ‘TRUMP’s.’ I’m just here to see if I can stop it! As Trump and Medvedev have traded taunts in recent days following Trump saying on Tuesday that Russia had “10 days from today” to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or be hit, along with its oil buyers, with tariffs, Moscow has shown no sign that it will comply with Trump’s deadline. As my colleague Shaun Walker reports from Kyiv, Vladimir Putin has not responded to Trump’s ultimatum. He has claimed he wants a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but has given no indication that he is willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine. “We need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,” said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before Trump’s new deadline for hostilities to cease. Trump has said if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement to end the war by next Friday, 8 August, he will impose a package of economic sanctions on Russia. Per my last post, Medvedev on Monday accused Trump of engaging in a “game of ultimatums” and reminded him that Russia possessed Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort after Trump told Medvedev to “watch his words”. Medvedev has emerged as one of the Kremlin’s most outspoken anti-western hawks since Putin sent tens of thousands of troops to launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Reuters notes that while Kremlin critics deride him as an irresponsible loose cannon, some western diplomats say his statements illustrate the thinking in senior Kremlin policymaking circles. The Associated Press also notes that with his frequently wielded nuclear threats and lobbing of insults at western leaders on social media, some observers have argued that Medvedev is seeking to score political points with Putin and Russian military hawks with his extravagant rhetoric. The escalation from Trump comes amid a spiralling war of words with the former Russian president over Trump’s efforts to get Russia to end its war in Ukraine. Trump yesterday called Medvedev a “failed former president”, writing on Truth Social that he should “watch his words” and is “entering very dangerous territory”. Russia and the USA do almost no business together. Let’s keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory! Medvedev, who was prime minister of Russia from 2012 to 2020 and is a very vocal supporter of its invasion of Ukraine, has ridiculed Trump’s ultimatum to the Kremlin to reach a peace deal. He wrote on X earlier this week: Trump’s playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10 … He should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn’t Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road! In another post on X, Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, called US senator Lindsey Graham “gramps”, after he told him to “get to the peace table”. It’s not for you or Trump to dictate when to ‘get at the peace table’. Negotiations will end when all the objectives of our military operation have been achieved. Work on America first, gramps! The jabs continued on Telegram, where Medvedev threatened Trump with a cold war-era doomsday weapon known as the “Dead Hand” – a Russian nuclear system designed to automatically launch a retaliatory strike. If a few words from a former Russian president can cause such a nervous reaction from the supposedly powerful President of the United States, then clearly Russia is right about everything and will continue its own way. And as for the ‘dead economies’ of India and Russia and ‘stepping into dangerous territory’ – well, let him recall his favorite movies about the ‘walking dead,’ as well as how dangerous the supposedly non-existent ‘Dead Hand’ can be. Donald Trump has said he had ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in “appropriate regions” in response to threats from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who said on Thursday that Trump should remember Moscow had Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities. Trump said in a post on Truth Social: Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that. Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances. Thank you for your attention to this matter! The Canadian team working on a trade deal with the US could walk away from talks in the wake of Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 35% tariff on some goods from Canada, an adviser to that country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said on Friday. Flavio Volpe, a member of Carney’s hand-picked Council on Canada-US Relations, told CBC News that the negotiators would stay in Washington for the time being. Yesterday, Trump signed an executive order increasing tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25% on all products not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. The White House cited what it said was Canada’s failure to stop fentanyl smuggling and a failure to address US concerns about trade barriers. Trump has also cited Carney’s plan to recognize a Palestinian state in September as making it “very hard” to reach a deal. “Team Canada is still in Washington working on a deal and they’re going to be there until we either have a conclusion of a good deal for Canada or that it’s time to take a pause and walk away,” said Volpe, president of Canada’s national Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. Carney wants a new deal to reset bilateral relations, saying Trump’s move to impose tariffs had irrevocably upended the decades-old trading and security ties between the two neighbors. The talks though have so far produced little. Washington is also unhappy about Canada’s refusal to drop its own Trudeau-era countermeasures. In June, Carney had threatened to ramp up counter-tariffs in July unless there was progress on the deal. A statement he issued early today did not mention retaliation at all. Brian Clow, a senior Trudeau aide who was in charge of US relations inside the prime minister’s office for several years, noted that Trump had announced a number of deals with nations that declined to impose counter-tariffs. “Unfortunately, Canada stands on its own right now, along with China, because many other countries around the world refused to stand up to this President,” he told Reuters. “So I’m not sure that further retaliation is the way to go here.” The offices of Carney and Dominic LeBlanc, the federal cabinet minister leading the Canadian team in Washington, were not immediately available for comment. Kamala Harris has said that she currently has no desire to re-enter “the system” of American politics because it is “broken”. Last night the Democratic party’s defeated presidential nominee, who replaced Joe Biden late in the 2024 campaign after he dropped his re-election bid, gave her first interview since losing the election to Donald Trump, talking to Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. After she announced she will not run for the governorship of California just a day earlier, Harris told the TV show that it was about something more “basic” than whether she wanted to run for something else instead – with the subtext being whether she will attempt a White House run again in 2028. “Recently I made the decision that I just – for now – I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken,” she said, provoking a collective groan from the studio audience. Colbert later returned to the subject, saying that her remark was harrowing. “Well, but it’s also evident, isn’t it?” she said. The former vice-president added: I always believed, that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that they’re not as strong as they need to be. And for now I don’t want to go back into that system. Harris’s choice of The Late Show as the channel for her first post-election defeat interview was pointed. The most-watched talkshow was cancelled last month by the CBS network, which pleaded financial stress, though the decision was widely denounced as being politically motivated. The cancellation was announced after Colbert had criticized CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, for reaching a $16m settlement with Trump. The president had sued CBS News over an interview on the 60 Minutes show with Harris at the height of last year’s presidential campaign, which Trump claimed had been manipulated in her favour. None of this febrile backstory was mentioned by either Colbert or Harris on Thursday. But she did delivery a passionate lament for the numbers of people who she said had “capitulated” to the aggressive second Trump administration. When Colbert invited her to say “I told you so” after she had predicted many of Trump’s most contentious moves – including Medicaid cuts, ignoring court orders and “massive tax cuts to the rich” – she replied: “But Stephen, what I did not predict was the capitulation.” She went on: Perhaps it’s naive of me … There should be many who consider themselves to be guardians of our system and our democracy who just capitulated, and I didn’t see that coming. Americans are struggling financially, grappling with debt and the rising cost of living, and are blaming the Trump administration and corporate interests for worsening economic outlooks for working families, according to a new poll. Six out of 10 Americans place blame on the Trump administration for driving up their cost of living, according to a poll conducted by Morning Consult for the Century Foundation, which asked 2,007 Americans how they are managing the high cost of living in the US economy, who they think is to blame and what are the solutions. The poll found 63% said Trump had had a negative impact on grocery prices, and 61% said he had had a negative impact on the cost of living. Nearly half, 49%, said the Trump administration had had a negative impact on their finances. Nearly eight out of 10 Americans, including 70% of Republicans, fear that Trump’s tariffs will increase the price of everyday goods. More than six out of 10 Americans said it had become more difficult to find a well-paying job, buy a home and afford childcare. Ghislaine Maxwell has been transferred from a Florida prison to a lower-security facility in Texas to continue serving her 20-year sentence, the US Bureau of Prisons said today. For Maxwell, an associate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the move from FCI Tallahassee, a low-security prison, to the federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, comes a week after she met with deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, who said he wanted to speak with her about anyone else who may have been involved in Epstein’s crimes of trafficking underage girls. Maxwell’s lawyer David Markus confirmed that she was moved. The reason for the move isn’t immediately clear yet, but Maxwell is appealing her conviction to the supreme court. The Bureau of Prisons classifies prison camps such as Bryan as minimum-security institutions, the lowest of five security levels in the federal system. Such facilities have limited or no perimeter fencing. Low-security facilities such as FCI Tallahassee have double-fenced perimeters and higher staff-to-inmate ratios than camps, according to the bureau. The House oversight committee has said that it also wants to speak with Maxwell. Markus said Maxwell would be open to this but only if the panel gives her immunity from prosecution for anything she says. Democrats are launching a nationwide summer blitz designed to force vulnerable Republicans to defend Trump’s big tax and spending bill, especially Medicaid cuts. The Democratic National Committee’s “Organizing Summer” will feature events in Alaska, Texas, Colorado and California over the coming week. The party’s message will be reinforced by online advertising and billboard trucks at county fairs targeting House Republicans in Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Jersey, among other states. The event aims to ensure that “Americans across the country know exactly who is responsible for taking away healthcare, food, construction jobs and nursing homes in order to give massive handouts to billionaires,” the chair of the DNC, Ken Martin, said. The package Trump signed into law on 4 July may become the defining issue of next year’s midterm elections. Republican leaders encourage their members to promote more popular aspects of the law in appearances where they’re less likely to face difficult questions or protests. Thousands of license applications by US companies to export goods and technology around the globe, including to China, are in limbo because turmoil at the agency in charge of approving them has left it nearly paralyzed, reports Reuters. While the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has long touted Trump’s tariff and trade deals, sources said the export bureau under Lutnick’s command has failed to issue expected new rules, stifled communications with industry representatives, pushed out experts, and lost staff through buyouts and resignations. Shipments of artificial intelligence chips from tech giant Nvidia to China are the most high-profile example of licenses not being swiftly approved. The company said on 14 July that the government assured it licenses would be granted for its H20 chip, and it hoped to start deliveries soon. Lutnick and other officials confirmed sales would be allowed. But sources said this week no licenses have yet been issued, and billions of dollars of AI chip orders are at stake. One US official said the backlog of license applications is the lengthiest in more than three decades. The US Transportation Department said today that it is cancelling $26m in grants for a long-delayed proposed high-speed rail project between Washington and Baltimore. The USDOT said it was rescinding funds for the proposed $20bn Baltimore-Washington Superconducting Magnetic Levitation, or Maglev project, after “nearly a decade of poor planning, significant community opposition, tremendous cost overruns, and nothing to show for it”. An environmental review of the project has been on pause since 2021. Further to my earlier post, Donald Trump has (yet again) called on top Federal Reserve officials to seize control from its chair, Jerome Powell, if he fails to cut interest rates, stepping up his extraordinary attacks on the central bank’s independence. The US president called Powell “a stubborn MORON” in a series of critical social media posts on Friday, days after the Fed held rates steady for the fifth consecutive time. It comes as Trump faces heightened questions over the impact of his aggressive economic policy, and the White House presses forward with plans for a fresh wave of tariffs next week. Hours before the federal government released data which underlined a significant deterioration in the jobs market, Trump again broke with precedent to pin blame on the Fed – and urge it to change course. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social network. “IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!” The Fed chair does not unilaterally set interest rates, which are decided by its rate-setting federal open market committee. Presidents typically respect its independence, leaving the central bank to make an objective decision – without political interference – about the best policy on interest rates for the US economy. Some countries received a reprieve from Donald Trump when he announced sweeping new levies yesterday. Lesotho was facing 50% tariffs on 2 April, an existential threat to its textile industry, but came out on Friday with a 15% rate. That should make it easier for manufacturers in Lesotho – which last month declared a national state of disaster over the country’s “high rates of youth unemployment and job losses” – to sell their goods to American consumers. That’s a relief for a nation which Trump said “nobody has ever heard of” when he halted USAID earlier this year. Also getting a drastic reduction in tariffs are Madagascar, down from 47% on 2 April to 15% on 1 August, and Botswana, down from 37% to 15%. Liechtenstein, the wealthy European state best known as a financial centre, has seen rates slashed from 37% to 15%, while the Falkland Islands have gone from 41% to 10%. Cambodia went from 49% to 19%, while Iraq only got a four-point reduction, from 39% to 35%. Democratic lawmakers have slammed Trump’s “reckless and chaotic” tariff policies and federal cuts after today’s weak jobs report revealed that 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously thought. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said on X: The chickens are coming home to roost for Trump, and American families are paying the price. His reckless and chaotic tariffs and his drastic cuts are catching up with the economy which means fewer jobs and more people out of work. Trump must end his trade war and reverse his horrible cuts now. California governor Gavin Newsom wrote: A July jobs report way below expectations. May and June revised down as well. Unemployment rate ticked back up to 4.2%. We haven’t seen conditions like these since 2020. Don’t let Donald Trump gaslight you. He is failing Americans and crashing our economy. Kathy Hochul, New York’s governor, said: Donald Trump is killing jobs and jacking up prices with his tariffs. Sellout Stefanik calls his leadership a ‘masterclass.’ I call it bullshit. We will fight back. Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut wrote: Unsurprising bad jobs report. Just 73,000 added in July, and most of those were health care. Even worse, May and June jobs numbers revised down by 258,000. Awful. Companies don’t want to create jobs in Trump’s chaos economy with weakening rule of law and rampant corruption. Representative Richard Neal, of Massachusetts, said: The American people didn’t ask for this. Hiring has stalled, prices are surging, and this administration is actively undermining the labor market Democrats rebuilt. This goes beyond failed Republican leadership, it’s actively making life harder for people. The main US stock indices have fallen sharply at the start of trading, as investors react to the flurry of tariffs announced last night and today’s weak US jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average (which contains 30 large US companies) has fallen by 1.1% at the start of trading, shedding 501 points to 43,629. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is down 1.2%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 1.5% – with Amazon falling almost 7% after issuing disappointing forecasts last night. The Swiss government is disappointed by the US tariffs imposed on Switzerland, president Karin Keller-Sutter has said, with the shock 39% figure much higher than expected – and one of the highest rates for any country. “The Federal Council is disappointed,” Keller-Sutter told Reuters on the sidelines of a Swiss national day event in Ruetli. “It is a pity that there is a tariff that is much higher than what we negotiated.” Although the pharmaceuticals sector was not included in the tariffs, the increased duties would have a “very bad” effect on the Swiss economy, she said. The government has already been in touch with Washington to find a solution, she added. The White House said on Friday that Switzerland is facing a higher 39% tariff rate on its exports because it refused to make “meaningful concessions” by dropping trade barriers with the US. “Switzerland, being one of the wealthiest, highest income countries on earth, cannot expect the United States to tolerate a one-sided trade relationship,” a White House official said. Here’s more on Canadian prime minister Mark Carney’s comments from earlier, when he said Ottawa is “disappointed” by the US decision to raise tariffs to 35% on Canadian goods not covered under a pre-existing US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. The US application of the USMCA treaty “means the US average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest for all of its trading partners”, Carney said. “Other sectors of our economy – including lumber, steel, aluminium, and automobiles – are, however, heavily impacted by US duties and tariffs,” Carney said. “For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversify our export markets.” He also criticized Trump’s justification for raising the tariffs. “Canada accounts for only 1% of US fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,” Carney said. Trump has long complained about a “flood” of fentanyl” coming from the north. He also said earlier this week that it would be “very hard” to make a trade deal with Canada after Carney’s announcement that he plans to join other countries in recognizing a Palestinian state. “Canada will be our own best customer,” Carney went on. “We can give ourselves more than any foreign government can ever take away by building with Canadian workers and by using Canadian resources to benefit all Canadians.” Here’s Carney’s full statement: Donald Trump has again repeated his plea for the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. Shortly after today’s weak jobs report was released, Trump posted on his Truth Social site: Too Little, Too Late. Jerome “Too Late” Powell is a disaster. DROP THE RATE! The good news is that Tariffs are bringing Billions of Dollars into the USA! The US dollar is being hammered on the foreign exchange markets, following the news that employment growth across America has been much weaker than previously thought over the last three months – a sign that the US labor market may be cooling. The latest non-farm payroll, just released, shows that US employment rose by just 73,000 in July, rather weaker than the 110,000 new jobs expected. But the big shock comes in the latest revisions to payrolls, with previous estimates for both May and June being revised sharply lower. The Bureau of Labor Statistics now estimates that just 19,000 new jobs were created in May, 125,000 fewer than the 144,000 previously estimated. June’s data has been revised down too - showing that just 14,000 new jobs were created, not the 147,000 reported a month ago. That means 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously thought. The US unemployment rate has risen to 4.2% from 4.1% in June. This surprisingly weak data may be a sign that Trump’s trade wars, and the associated uncertainty, have cause more damage to the US economy than previously thought. There could also be an impact from cost-cutting Doge program pushed by Elon Musk. Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff has visited Gaza today and been shown one of the controversial aid sites around which Israeli forces have killed hundreds of Palestinian people waiting for aid. Witkoff, the US president’s special envoy for the Middle East, had earlier met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid mounting international horror over starvation in Gaza that follows months of Israeli-imposed aid restrictions. The visit to the site in Rafah by Witkoff – a former real estate lawyer with no foreign policy or humanitarian background, who has also met Vladimir Putin on Trump’s behalf – was reported by a number Israeli media organisations and comes as Human Rights Watch on Friday described the aid sites run by the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – as “death traps” that had become the scene of regular “bloodbaths”. The UN has said almost nine hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces attempting to reach the sites. According to the White House, the visit by Witkoff, accompanied by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, was aimed at finding ways to speed deliveries to Gaza. “The special envoy and the ambassador will brief the president immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters. Trump on Thursday called the situation in Gaza “a terrible thing” when asked about comments from his ally and Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who became the first GOP lawmaker to call Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory a genocide. “Oh, it’s terrible what’s occurring there, yeah, it’s a terrible thing. People are very hungry,” Trump told reporters when asked about Greene’s social media comments, while also saying Washington had given financial assistance to address the hunger crisis in Gaza. My colleagues have created a searchable table of the countries and the “reciprocal” tariffs they face. The rates, which range from 41% for Syria to 10% for the UK, can be found in the table via the link below. A quick summary. Stock markets in Europe and across Asia-Pacific countries have fallen after Donald Trump announced new tariffs on dozens of US trading partners. Last night, as the latest deadline to reach deals approached, Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to 41%. Rates were set at 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa ahead of the US president’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August for striking trade deals with countries worldwide. Trump also extended the deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico by another 90 days. Share prices have weakened in response – with Germany’s DAX down 1.9% and France’s CAC losing 2.2%, as European stock markets fell to a one-month low. Asia-Pacific stock markets were on track for their worst week since April, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 losing 0.6%, South Africa’s stock market is now down almost 1.5%. Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said he was disappointed that Donald Trump was raising its tariffs from 25% to 35%. And there was shock in Switzerland, which has been lumbered with a 39% tariff rate – which manufacturers fear will lead to job losses. You can follow more on our business live blog: Cambodia’s prime minister has praised the new tariff rate and said it is good news for the nation’s economic development. Prime minister Hun Manet said in a statement posted to Facebook late on Thursday night that “this is the best news for the people and economy of Cambodia to continue to develop the country.” “The United States has decided to reduce the tax on goods imported from Cambodia to the United States by 19% (down 30% compared to the initial tax rate of 49%),” Manet wrote in a translation of the post. This comes after Donald Trump had originally threatened a 49% tariff on Cambodia as part of his “Liberation Day” measures, but cut it to 36% last month. India is engaged with further trade talks with the US, a source said on Friday. This comes after Donald Trump signed an order imposing a 25% tariff on New Delhi’s export. “We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. Previously, trade talks between Washington and New Delhi have been bogged down by issues including access to India’s highly protected agriculture and dairy sector. Trump set steep import duties on dozens of trading partners, including a 35% tariff on many goods from Canada, 50% for Brazil, 20% for Taiwan and 39% for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of US politics as Donald Trump has signed an executive order ranging from 10% to 41% on imports from dozens of trade partners in his latest attempt to reshape the global economy. The order applies to 68 countries and the 27-member European Union. Rates were set at 25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan, 19% for Thailand and 15% for South Korea. It includes an executive order to increase tariffs on Canadian goods imported to the US from 25% to 35%. He cited Canada’s failure to curb fentanyl smuggling across the border as a reason for why. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney said in a statement that he is “disappointed” by the announcement, then said Canada accounts for just 1% of US fentanyl imports. Carney also said that Canada remains committed to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He closed the statement by saying that Canadians will be their “own best customer”. “We can give ourselves more than any foreign government can ever take away by building with Canadian workers and by using Canadian resources to benefit all Canadians,” it reads.
