  A highway outside of Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, was dizzy with glizzys on
  Friday after a truckload of hotdogs spilled across the I-83, as local
  commuters learned that even the weakest hot dog link can cause a chain
  reaction. State police said the tractor trailer had an unspecified mechanical
  problem on Interstate-83 a few miles north of the Maryland line as morning
  rush hour was wrapping up, causing it to push into a passenger vehicle. When
  the truck scraped along a concrete divider, its trailer was ripped open and
  the contents scattered. As crews worked to ketchup with the rolling dogs, they
  came face to face with the unpleasant nature of how the sausage is made when
  it comes to roadside cleanup. “Once those leave the truck and hit the road,
  that’s all garbage, and it’s still pretty warm,” Brad Dauberman, the
  Shrewsbury fire company chief, said as crews worked to snap up franks grilling
  in the summer sun. The dogs are sadly unusable, and will likely go to
  slaughter. Dauberman said that he did not relish the cleanup task. “I can tell
  you personally, hot dogs are very slippery,” the fire chief said. “I did not
  know that.” The four people injured might not feel like weiners, but need not
  fear for the wurst, as police said their injuries were not life threatening.
