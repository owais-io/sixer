  Iman Salim is used to seeing flood waters in the field of lush lilypads next
  to her home in the village of Kamanwala. But nothing prepared her for this
  week, when torrential monsoon rains that broke a 49-year record lashed the
  area, flooding her house with water that rose above her chest. “The whole
  house has drowned. The water left nothing,” the 24-year-old said. Kamanwala,
  just outside the city of Sialkot, from where the mountains of Kashmir can be
  seen on a clear day, is among more than 1,400 villages in Pakistan’s eastern
  Punjab province flooded after three large rivers – the Sutlej, Chenab and Ravi
  – overflowed their banks because of heavy rain and the release of water from
  over-full dams in neighbouring India. The rising waters have brought fears of
  disease, with the province’s chief minister, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, declaring an
  emergency in hospitals across Punjab over fears that cholera and hepatitis
  could spread and an increased risk of poisoning from snake bites. On Tuesday,
  the Phalku River, which flows out from India, Kashmir and into Pakistan’s
  eastern city of Sialkot, also overflowed its banks. In just a few hours,
  Salim’s family’s entire possessions were destroyed. In the face of soaring
  inflation and the depreciation of the rupee, replacing entire life possessions
  and repairing homes will be impossible for many. “This is the first time in my
  life that this much flood water has come,” said Salim’s father, Sayed Muhamad,
  a 60-year-old labourer. “There’s been no electricity, no water, no gas for
  three days. The damage that’s been caused is around 500,000 Pakistani rupees
  [£1,300].” Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to
  the climate crisis, despite producing less than 0.1% of global greenhouse gas
  emissions. Flooding is common during monsoon season, which occurs from about
  July to September every year. But this year’s monsoon rains – made more
  erratic, unpredictable and deadly by the climate emergency – have unleashed
  chaos that has left Pakistan and its government scrambling. New Delhi alerted
  Islamabad last week to expect cross-border flooding. Since then, nearly
  300,000 people have been evacuated from flood areas and Pakistani authorities
  have been forced to overflow riverbanks after their own dams threatened to
  burst. Across the country more than 800 people have been killed in floods
  since late June – most of them in the north-west Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
  An hour away from Sialkot, the Chenab River has risen so high it is almost
  touching a train track passing over it, and water rushed within a few feet of
  the base of huge electricity pylons. Entire villages are lying underwater
  across the affected areas in Punjab, Pakistan’s breadbasket and home to about
  half of its 255 million people. Dr Bilal Siddiq, a senior physician with
  Sahara Foundation, which has set up a medical camp in Kartarpur village in
  Jalandhar district to treat those with illnesses caused by a lack of clean
  water and food, told Associated Press: “Fungal and skin infections are
  everywhere. We’re also seeing rising cases of diarrhoea, gastric pain and
  malaria.” Some flood victims around Sialkot have been left alone to fend for
  themselves, spending at least two days without food, water and electricity.
  “No one has come to help us until today,” said Shabana Zubair, 38, who has
  five children and was without food and water. “Our flour, rice and chickpeas
  were all spoiled.” Across the streets and alleys of Naik Wadi Chownk, a rank,
  fish-like smell hangs in the air. Children play and swim in flood water that
  has lain stagnant in 30C (86F) heat and mixed with sewage from open drains
  blocked even before the floods. Sialkot is home to a thriving entrepreneurial
  business community who independently raised funds to build what they proudly
  proclaim as the world’s first privately owned international airport. That same
  community collectively financed the refurbishment of Sialkot’s roads 25 years
  ago. Nevertheless, like many other urban ares in Pakistan, the city has long
  suffered blocked sewers and a poor waste management system. In 2021 the Asian
  Development Bank and regional government embarked on a $250m (£185m) project
  to replace 30km of sewage pipes in Sialkot and install a sewage pump, but the
  problems have not gone away. Khawar Anwar Khawaja, the former chief executive
  of Sialkot international airport, whose father also built the city’s chamber
  of commerce, said local authorities bore partial responsibility. “Whenever
  there was rain, it drained very quickly but over the years, [Sialkot’s
  drainage system] has rotted because the local government is not playing its
  role in cleaning, de-silting the drains,” he said. “They’ve got billions of
  rupees but they’re not doing a proper job.” Voluntary and community-funded aid
  deliveries in Sialkot city have quickly sprung up to fill the gap where the
  government has been slow to react. A group of 14 volunteers from the charity
  Sherzan have been delivering cooked food, cartons of milk and water from the
  back of a truck pulled by a tractor – one of the few vehicles that can safely
  traverse the flooded alleys and roads of Sialkot and its surrounding villages.
  “We have no other option. The [government] doesn’t have full facilities and
  medication to deal with this,” said 28-year-old Wajahat Mirza, a volunteer who
  has been working for flood-relief initiatives for the past 15 years. “We can
  pray, we can do better on our end, but we cannot expect anything from our
  governments.”
