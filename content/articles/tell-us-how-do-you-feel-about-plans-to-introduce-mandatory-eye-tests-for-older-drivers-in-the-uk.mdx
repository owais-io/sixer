  Tell us: how do you feel about plans to introduce mandatory eye tests for
  older drivers in the UK?
sectionName: World news
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-11T09:19:54Z'
bodyText: >-
  Older drivers could face mandatory eye tests and the drink-drive limit could
  be cut as the government tries to reduce the number of road deaths. The
  proposals, expected to be published as part of a road safety strategy in the
  autumn, could introduce a new requirement for over-70s to take an eye test
  every three years when they renew their driving licence. The expected changes
  come amid concern about the number of people being killed or seriously injured
  on Britain’s roads. Last year, 1,633 people were killed and almost 28,000
  seriously injured in traffic incidents. We’d like to hear from older drivers
  about how they feel about taking a mandatory eye test to keep their licence.
