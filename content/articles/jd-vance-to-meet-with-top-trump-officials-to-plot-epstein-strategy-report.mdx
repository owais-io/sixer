  JD Vance will reportedly host a meeting on Wednesday evening at his residence
  with a handful of senior Trump administration officials to discuss their
  strategy for dealing with the ongoing scandal surrounding the convicted sex
  offender Jeffrey Epstein. The vice-president’s gathering, first detailed by
  CNN, is reportedly set to include the attorney general, Pam Bondi; the deputy
  attorney general, Todd Blanche; the FBI director, Kash Patel; and the White
  House chief of staff, Susie Wiles. Sources familiar with the gathering told
  CNN and ABC News that the officials will be discussing whether to release the
  transcript of the justice department’s recent interview with Ghislaine
  Maxwell, Epstein’s associate and a convicted sex trafficker. Two weeks ago the
  justice department sent Blanche, who is also one of Donald Trump’s former
  personal lawyers, to interview Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison for
  sex trafficking and other crimes. That meeting lasted two days and details
  from it have not been made public. According to ABC News, the administration
  is considering publicly releasing the transcripts from the interview as soon
  as this week. On Wednesday, Alicia Arden, who filed a police report against
  Epstein in 1997 accusing him of sexually assaulting her, appeared at a news
  conference and implored the government to release all of the files related to
  the Epstein case. “I’m tired of the government saying that they want to
  release them. Please just do it,” she said, adding that she would like to know
  what Blanche asked Maxwell during their meeting, and what Maxwell’s responses
  were. Maxwell, Arden said, “should not be pardoned”. “She was convicted of
  sex-trafficking children,” she added. “This is a terrible crime.” Arden was
  joined by her lawyer, Gloria Allred, who also said that the Trump
  administration should release the “entire transcript” of Blanche’s interview
  with Maxwell “including all of his questions and all of her answers”. Last
  week, Maxwell was quietly transferred from a Florida prison to a
  lower-security facility in Texas. Trump claimed to reporters that he “didn’t
  know” about the transfer. The Trump administration has faced mounting pressure
  and a bipartisan backlash after the justice department announced it would not
  be releasing additional documents related to Epstein, despite earlier promises
  by Trump and Bondi that they would do so. Epstein, who died in prison in New
  York in 2019 while awaiting federal trial, is the subject of countless
  conspiracy theories, in part due to his ties to high-profile and powerful
  individuals. On Tuesday, the House oversight committee subpoenaed the justice
  department for files related to the Epstein sex-trafficking investigation and
  issued subpoenas for depositions from several prominent figures. They included
  the former president Bill Clinton; the former secretary of state Hillary
  Clinton; multiple former attorneys general, including Jeff Sessions, Alberto
  Gonzales, William Barr and Merrick Garland; and the former FBI directors James
  Comey and Robert Mueller. Axios pointed out that Trump’s former labor
  secretary Alex Acosta was absent from the list despite his involvement in the
  2008 plea deal with Epstein when Acosta was a top federal prosecutor in
  Florida. Axios noted that Acosta’s boss during his time in Florida, Gonzales,
  is on the subpoena list. At the news conference on Wednesday, Allred, who has
  represented multiple Epstein victims, said she believes that Acosta should
  also be subpoenaed, as well as Blanche and Bondi. Allred said that she
  believes that “victims and survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
  should be invited to appear before the House and Senate committees” to share
  their stories, how “they were victimized by Epstein and Maxwell, the impact on
  them of these crimes, and how the criminal justice system has helped them or
  failed them”. Maxwell, who was found guilty of sex trafficking and other
  charges in December 2021, is appealing her conviction to the supreme court,
  citing Epstein’s plea agreement. This week, her attorneys also opposed the
  government’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Epstein
  case. “Jeffrey Epstein is dead,” her lawyers wrote. “Ghislaine Maxwell is not.
  Whatever interest the public may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify
  a broad intrusion into grand jury secrecy in a case where the defendant is
  alive, her legal options are viable and her due process rights remain.”
  Maxwell also said last week that she was willing to testify before Congress if
  she was granted immunity. The Democratic representative Raja Krishnamoorthi,
  who has introduced a resolution in Congress that opposes Maxwell receiving a
  presidential pardon or any other form of clemency, told CNN on Wednesday that
  he believes the “vast majority of Americans oppose any form of clemency for
  Maxwell, and we need to say that with one voice in Congress as well”. The
  White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment relating to
  the Vance meeting.
