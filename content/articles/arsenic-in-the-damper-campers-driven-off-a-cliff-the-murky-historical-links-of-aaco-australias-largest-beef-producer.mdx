  Warning: This article contains historical records that use racist and
  offensive language, and descriptions of events that will be distressing to
  some readers. It also contains references to Indigenous Australians who have
  died In a bustling Newcastle suburb there is a large park where families
  gather under giant fig trees. Few know it is named after a man who killed
  Aboriginal people. Gregson Park was given to the local council in 1889 by
  Jesse Gregson, then the head of one of the nation’s most important
  enterprises, the Australian Agricultural Company. AACo, today worth about
  $830m, is still Australia’s largest beef producer, with stations covering
  almost 1% of the nation’s land mass. Its majority shareholder is the UK
  billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family own Tottenham Hotspur, followed by the
  Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest and his ex-wife, Nicola Forrest. An
  investigation as part of Guardian Australia’s the Descendants series has
  revealed the company’s historical links with the dispossession, shooting and
  poisoning of Aboriginal people – through the exploits of Gregson before he
  joined the company, and others who helped establish its farming operations in
  the 19th century. The discoveries raise complex questions about how
  longstanding Australian companies can reckon with past harms. Before Gregson
  joined AACo in the 1870s, he managed a sheep station in central Queensland
  where he perpetrated a series of massacres that unleashed a bloody war.
  Gregson arrived at Rainworth station, 300km inland from Rockhampton, in June
  1861. Queensland had become a self-governing colony two years earlier and the
  frontier was moving north, assisted by the notorious native police –
  contingents of Aboriginal troopers led by white officers tasked with
  protecting the livelihoods of settlers and punishing Aboriginal resistance. As
  Gregson and his workers approached the station, they were greeted by
  Aboriginal people. “We had been met by blacks who made overtures of peace by
  attaching white feathers to our horses’ bridles or anywhere they could stick
  them,” the pastoralist wrote in his memoirs. “As soon as the drays reached the
  camp I gave the blacks to understand that they must keep clear which they did
  good humouredly enough.” The next month he and the native police went looking
  for some missing sheep, finding them on the side of a ridge with a Gayiri
  tribe. They opened fire. Gregson describes the encounter as a “brush” but
  native police records show at least four Gayiri people were shot. Months
  later, on the property next to Gregson’s, the Gayiri responded by killing 19
  men, women and children – including the Victorian sheep farmer Horatio Wills,
  the father of the Australian rules football co-founder Tom Wills. It was
  Queensland’s largest massacre of white settlers by Aboriginal people. Gregson
  assembled a group of settlers to track those he believed to be responsible.
  Finding them within days, they shot the sleeping tribe, killing at least 30.
  More reprisals would follow, led by native police and vigilantes, wiping out
  about 300 Aboriginal people. There are various theories about what provoked
  the Wills massacre but the commonly held view among historians, Indigenous
  knowledge holders and Wills’ descendants is that the encounter with Gregson
  and the native police was a tipping point. It is believed that the Gayiri
  thought Horatio Wills was Gregson’s brother, and therefore an appropriate
  target for retribution. About a decade later Gregson moved to Newcastle in New
  South Wales to take up the position of superintendent of AACo. He remains the
  company’s longest-serving superintendent, holding the position for 30 years,
  and wrote one of the first histories of the company. Darryl Black, a Bidjara
  and Ghungalu man from central Queensland who learned of the massacres from his
  father, said Gregson “wasn’t a very good person at all”. He described
  Gregson’s appointment to the prestigious company as his “reward” for opening
  up the region to farming and grazing. ‘A place to be shunned’ Founded in 1824,
  AACo is the oldest continuously operating company in Australia. It was
  established by an act of British parliament when a handful of UK politicians,
  banking directors and business leaders were granted 1m acres of land around
  Port Stephens to raise sheep for fleece to be sold on the London market. The
  Worimi historian John Maynard wrote that the company’s arrival on his
  ancestors’ country at a time when his people were being ravaged by violence
  and disease was both a lifeline and “another means of enforced organised
  brutality”. The company employed Aboriginal people as stockmen, sailors,
  constables and domestic workers. When AACo experienced convict labour
  shortages, the company’s records show that Aboriginal workers helped fill the
  gap and were an essential part of its success. Historical reports link the
  company to at least two shooting attacks on Aboriginal people near Newcastle
  in the Hunter Valley region, in 1830 and 1835, in retaliation for the spearing
  of shepherds and livestock. In the later encounter, according to a 1922
  newspaper article, soldiers retained by AACo joined local vigilantes in
  tracking an Aboriginal group who had speared five shepherds. The soldiers,
  fearing ambush, stopped before the rest of the group fired on the sleeping
  camp at a cliff’s edge – but, according to the report, later re-engaged to
  hunt down survivors. “Maddened with fear under the gunfire they broke hither
  and thither in vain attempts to escape,” the article says of the clifftop
  encounter. “Panic stricken they turned to the cliff edge and sprang into
  space.” About the same time, the same article claims that a group of convicts
  employed on an AACo station poisoned a group of Aboriginal people in
  retaliation for raids on cattle, by giving them damper laced with arsenic. It
  says they “lay down and died all around”. The modern-day suburb of Belbora
  (from the Worimi Baal Bora) is said to be named after the tragedy, meaning “a
  place to be shunned”. AACo eventually sold its NSW properties and moved into
  cattle production. Today it holds 7m hectares across the Northern Territory
  and Queensland, including two properties within an hour of Gregson’s former
  station. An AACo spokesperson told Guardian Australia: “We won’t and can’t
  comment on historical matters, especially given we don’t have access to
  records from the time.” Most of the company’s records, dating back to 1824,
  are held at the Australian National University. Last year, to mark its 200th
  anniversary, the company held an exhibition showcasing its history through
  archival photos, maps, drawings and papers held at the university. The
  exhibition’s section on Aboriginal history said the Worimi people had been
  largely displaced by cedar getters (convicts who harvested timber) before AACo
  was established, but the company “would also have displaced some of the local
  Worimi”. James Fitzgerald, a legal consultant for the Australasian Centre for
  Corporate Responsibility, said companies had an obligation to confront the
  “evils of the past”. “Just creeping along as though nothing happened is moral
  cowardice, particularly when it’s an enterprise that’s making money off
  dispossession,” he said. “The more a company’s wealth is built on that sort of
  dispossession, I would have thought, the greater its obligation to take
  account of that as a decent corporate citizen in 2025.” Fitzgerald said there
  were comparable cases in which mining companies had made reparations through
  apologies, working with traditional owners to improve cultural heritage
  management, setting Indigenous employment targets or negotiating financial
  compensation. The AACo spokesperson said the company had built “trusted
  relationships” with many traditional custodians across the properties managed.
  “We recognise their culture and deep connection to Country and work with them
  to ensure we engage respectfully,” they said. Joe Lewis, through a
  spokesperson, declined to comment to Guardian Australia. Andrew and Nicola
  Forrest did not respond to questions. Fitzgerald said the 1992 Mabo verdict,
  which recognised Indigenous peoples’ rights to their land, raised complex
  questions for Australian companies that had built their wealth on land taken
  from and cleared of Aboriginal people. “If you keep pulling at the thread long
  enough, it implicates the entire basis of our sovereign state and economy,” he
  said. “We are all the beneficiaries of these actions in one way or another,
  whether as real property owners, shareholders or super fund members.”
