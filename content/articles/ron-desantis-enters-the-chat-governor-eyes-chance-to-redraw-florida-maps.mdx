  With Gavin Newsom and Greg Abbott, the respective heavyweight governors of
  California and Texas, trading blows over plans to gerrymander the 2026
  midterms, it was always kind of inevitable that Florida’s Ron DeSantis would
  enter the chat. The Republican sees his state, the nation’s third-largest by
  several metrics, not least its 28 congressional seats, as pivotal in the
  redistricting wars for control of the House. So few were surprised this week
  when DeSantis gave his full-throated endorsement to two projects to try to
  save the Republican majority: Donald Trump’s call for an unprecedented
  mid-decade census that could blow things up nationally; and state Republicans’
  efforts to redraw existing district maps in their favor, similar to Abbott’s
  scheming in Texas. “We have 28 now, we might have 29, 30, 31, maybe. Who
  knows?” DeSantis said at a press conference in Melbourne on Monday, expressing
  his belief that a new national population tally that excludes undocumented
  immigrants could expand Florida’s congressional delegation. Currently, 20 of
  those 28 seats are held by Republicans. Even without a census, DeSantis and
  allies including the Florida house speaker, Daniel Perez, have concluded that
  tinkering with existing boundaries and dumping blocs of Democratic voters into
  heavily Republican districts could net them several more. Perez, bolstered by
  a Florida supreme court ruling in July that approved DeSantis’s wholesale
  stripping of Black voters’ influence in the north of the state, is convening a
  “select committee on congressional redistricting” to do the same in the south.
  The long-serving congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Trump bete noire
  Jared Moskowitz are two of the prominent south Florida Democrats in DeSantis’s
  crosshairs. “We are going to have to do a mid-decade redistricting,” DeSantis
  said. “Obviously you would have to redraw the lines. Even if they don’t do a
  new census, even if they don’t revise the current census, I do think that it
  is appropriate to be doing it.” To Florida Democrats who have promised to
  fight the emerging threat to the eight House seats they do still hold,
  DeSantis’s maneuvering is a stereotypical power-play by a governor who has
  frequently been able to bend the state legislature to his will. “This isn’t
  about drawing lines on a map, this is about who gets hurt and who gets
  silenced in this thing we call democracy, or in this democratic process,” said
  Shevrin Jones, a Democratic state senator whose district covers parts of
  downtown Miami and Miami Beach. “Floridians were extremely clear years ago
  when we voted on fair districts that the redistricting process should be fair
  and transparent, that it should be reflective of the people and not the
  political ambitions of those who are in power. Yet that’s what we’re seeing
  right now.” To many critics, the Florida supreme court’s ruling, authored by
  the chief justice, Carlos Muñiz, a DeSantis appointee, was a sleight of hand:
  it stated that the districts drawn – by Republicans – that ensured fair Black
  representation violated a 2010 voter-approved constitutional amendment banning
  partisan and racial gerrymandering during redistricting. Yet the effect of the
  ruling was to essentially nullify the amendment by validating DeSantis’s
  manipulation of the northern districts to the Republicans’ advantage, and to
  give him a green light to do the same anywhere else. Nikki Fried, the chair of
  the Florida Democratic party, said the governor had seized on the ruling to
  blatantly attempt to rig the 2026 midterms. “After gutting representation for
  Black Floridians and stacking the court to uphold it, he wants to further
  gerrymander and suppress the vote of millions of Floridians,” she said in a
  statement. “If Ron DeSantis spent half as much time solving real problems as
  he does scheming to steal elections, maybe we wouldn’t be in the middle of a
  housing, insurance and education crisis.” Republicans hold a supermajority in
  both chambers of the Florida legislature, so any walkout by Democrats, similar
  to that seen in Texas where lawmakers fled the state to deny quorum, would be
  ineffective. Instead, Jones said, his party, at state level at least, will
  continue to call out what they see as underhand efforts by the DeSantis
  administration to join the national Republican drive to save its House
  majority in support of Trump’s agenda. “I understand where Gavin Newsom and a
  great deal of Democratic governors are coming from when they say fight fire
  with fire. That’s fair, we can’t continue as Democrats to show up to a
  gunfight with slingshots,” he said. “I also understand that the Republicans
  are in power, and I understand they have no scruples about what they’re doing,
  I get that. The question is when or how can we find the alliances that exist
  to push back on the bullshit that the Republicans are doing, because it’s an
  absolute threat to not just democracy, but an absolute threat to our national
  security and our future.” Jones said that DeSantis, a lame-duck governor about
  to enter his final year in office before being termed out, had leapt upon the
  opportunity to inject himself back into the national picture. Still wounded by
  the humiliating collapse of his pursuit of the Republican presidential
  nomination a year and a half ago, DeSantis has seen himself eclipsed in the
  2028 race by emerging hopefuls including Vice-President JD Vance and secretary
  of state Marco Rubio, the former Florida senator. “This isn’t just about
  Florida, it’s about national political positioning. The only way Ron DeSantis
  can prove that his voice is still loud is doing or saying asinine things like
  this to continue to kiss ass to Trump,” Jones said. “I think the governor is
  trying to restart a failing campaign that lost gas quickly, and I think he’s
  trying to fill it back up. But that car doesn’t work any more, and I don’t
  know any mechanic that wants to work to fix it.”
