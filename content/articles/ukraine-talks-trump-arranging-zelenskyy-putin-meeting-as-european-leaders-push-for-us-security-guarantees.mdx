  Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to
  discuss a peace deal in Ukraine, according to Donald Trump and European
  leaders, although Moscow has not confirmed the meeting. The potential
  breakthrough came after a day of tense diplomacy at the White House in which
  Trump ruled out a ceasefire while Zelenskyy and his allies pushed for
  US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term agreement. The
  Ukrainian president said that following the talks security guarantees for Kyiv
  would be “formalised” within 10 days. “At the conclusion of the meetings, I
  called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a
  location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy,”
  Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, adding that a trilateral meeting
  including the US president would follow. British prime minister Keir Starmer
  and German chancellor Friedrich Merz appeared to confirm the meeting. Merz
  told reporters: “The American president spoke with the Russian president on
  the phone and agreed that there would be a meeting between the Russian
  president and the Ukrainian president within the next two weeks.” But the
  chancellor cautioned: “We don’t know whether the Russian president will have
  the courage to attend such a summit. Therefore, persuasion is needed.” Putin,
  for his part, said he was open to the “idea” of direct talks with Ukraine as
  he spoke by phone with Trump, according to Russia’s Tass news agency, but
  there was no confirmation that the meeting would take place. Earlier,
  Zelenskyy said Ukraine was ready to meet with Russia in “any format” and that
  territorial issues would be discussed on a bilateral level with the Russian
  president. Monday’s meeting came after Trump met Putin in Anchorage and said
  the onus would now be on Zelenskyy to agree to concessions that he said could
  end the war. Some commentators saw it as a damage limitation exercise after
  Trump was apparently swayed by Putin and began to echo his talking points.
  Trump, who only last week warned Russia of “very severe consequences” if Putin
  failed to agree to a halt the fighting, made clear that he had reversed his
  position. Welcoming Zelenskyy to the hastily assembled meeting at the Oval
  Office, Trump referred to other conflicts which he claimed to have ended,
  telling reporters: “I don’t think you’d need a ceasefire. If you look at the
  six deals that I settled this year, they were all at war – I didn’t do any
  ceasefires.” He did, however, say the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s safety
  – something Kyiv has long said would be essential for a lasting peace. Trump
  said: “When it comes to security, there’s going to be a lot of help.” But the
  US president made it clear that European countries would be expected to carry
  the burden, adding: “They are a first line of defence because they’re there.
  But we’ll help them out.” The Ukrainian president said his country has offered
  to buy $90bn worth of US weapons as part of the security guarantee, “which
  primarily includes aircraft, air defence systems”. “There indeed is a package
  with our proposals worth $90bn,” Zelenskyy said. “And we have agreements with
  the US president that when our export opens, they will buy Ukrainian drones.
  This is important for us.” After meeting the leaders of Germany, Britain,
  France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato, Trump wrote on his Truth
  Social platform that there had been discussion of security guarantees and
  “which guarantees would be provided by the European countries, with a
  coordination with the United States of America”. French president Emmanuel
  Macron said the talks did not include Kyiv surrendering territory to Russia.
  Trump’s initial conversation with Zelenskyy went more smoothly than their
  first encounter in the Oval Office six months ago, when the Ukrainian leader
  was ambushed and berated by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance. This time,
  doubtless to the relief of European leaders, Zelenskyy gave Trump effusive
  thanks for the invitation and the pair even shared good-humoured banter while
  Vance remained silent. Sitting with Starmer and other European leaders in the
  east room, Trump acknowledged: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate
  ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe something like that could
  happen. As of this moment, it’s not happening.” But some of the European
  allies refused to accept defeat on the issue, mindful that the lack of
  ceasefire buys Putin more time to wage his war of aggression. On Monday,
  Ukraine said Russian attacks on major cities had killed at least 10 people,
  including a toddler and her 16-year-old brother in Kharkiv. Merz insisted that
  “we would all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next
  meeting taking place without one. “Let’s work on that and let’s try to put
  pressure on Russia – because the credibility of these efforts we are
  undertaking today depend on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of the
  serious negotiations,” Merz said. Macron also backed the idea of a “truce” as
  a “necessity”. Unmoved, Trump suggested that would be left to Zelenskyy and
  Putin: “Well, we’re going to let the president go over and talk to the
  president, and we’ll see how that works out.” He added: “And again I say it,
  in the six wars that I’ve settled, I haven’t had a ceasefire.” The US
  president told his fellow leaders: “We also need to discuss the possible
  exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact
  – that means the war zone.” But he also said Putin had accepted there would be
  security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any peace deal. Trump said: “In a
  very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept
  security guarantees for Ukraine and this is one of the key points that we need
  to consider and we’re going to be considering that at the table, also who will
  do what essentially.” Several of the leaders emphasised the importance of the
  security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again. Macron said: “The
  first one is clearly a credible Ukrainian army for the years and decades to
  come.” Europe was also clear about carrying its “fair share” of the burden, he
  said, “so you can count on this as we can continue.” Giorgia Meloni, the prime
  minister of Italy, said: ‘We will talk about many important topics. The first
  one is security guarantees, how to be sure that it won’t happen again, which
  is the precondition of every kind of peace.” Asked by a journalist if it would
  be the “end of the road” for US support for Ukraine if no deal is struck,
  Trump said it was “never the end of the road. People are being killed and we
  want to stop that.” Trump added: “We’re going to make sure that if there’s
  peace, that peace is going to stay long-term … We’re not talking about a
  two-year peace and then we end up in this mess again.” Zelenskyy outlined what
  he said his country needed to feel secure, which included a “strong Ukrainian
  army” through weapons sales and training. The second part, he said, would
  depend on the outcome of Monday’s talks and any guarantees European Union
  countries, Nato and the US would be able to offer to the war-torn country.
  Trump declined to rule out sending US troops to Ukraine, noting it would be a
  discussion point with European leaders. Zelenskyy’s charm offensive included
  presenting a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Trump’s wife Melania,
  who over the weekend wrote to Putin urging him to consider children impacted
  by the war. In stark contrast to the acrimony in February, there were also
  lighter moments. Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump TV reporter, told Zelenskyy that
  “you look fabulous in that suit”. Glenn had asked the Ukrainian leader about
  his clothing during his last visit to the Oval Office, implying that his
  casual dress was disrespectful. Trump jumped in, saying: “I said the same
  thing.” Turning to Zelenskyy, Trump said: “That’s the one that attacked you
  last time.” “I remember that,” Zelenskyy said, before addressing Glenn: “But
  you are in the same suit ... I changed, you have not.”
