  Brazilian police have claimed in court documents that they have found a
  document on the mobile phone of former president Jair Bolsonaro suggesting he
  had planned to flee to Argentina ahead of his judgment for allegedly plotting
  a military coup. The far-right populist is facing a jail term of over 40 years
  when Brazil’s supreme court convenes next month to decide whether he is guilty
  of conspiring to overturn the result of the 2022 presidential election, which
  Bolsonaro lost to his leftwing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro
  denies the charges but some legal and political experts believe the weight of
  evidence means his conviction and a heavy sentence are virtually guaranteed.
  On Wednesday, federal police investigators filed a 170-page report to the
  supreme court claiming to have found a document that was saved on the
  ex-president’s phone in February 2024 – two days after his passport was seized
  as a result of the coup investigation. In the report – which was reviewed by
  the Guardian – police said the document indicated he was planning to seek
  political asylum in Argentina, which is governed by his far-right ally Javier
  Milei. “In my country of origin I am being persecuted for essentially
  political reasons and crimes,” Bolsonaro’s alleged draft asylum request
  claims, describing the former president as “a politically persecuted person”.
  The undated and unsigned letter was addressed to “the most excellent president
  of Argentina Javier Gerardo Miliei [sic]”. It claimed Bolsonaro was “facing
  imminent arrest” – something the asylum request said would be “unjust,
  illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional”. An Argentine government source told
  the Reuters news agency that Milei’s office had not received a letter.
  Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil from 2019 until the end of 2022, insists he
  hopes to challenge Lula in next year’s presidential election, despite having
  already been barred from running by the supreme court for spreading
  disinformation. He is currently living under house arrest in the capital,
  Brasília, after the supreme court found he had violated a court order
  forbidding him from using social media. In their report to the supreme court,
  federal police alleged the letter indicated that Bolsonaro had “planned to
  flee the country, in order to prevent the law being enforced”. The accusation
  that Bolsonaro had planned to flee Brazil for Argentina came as federal police
  formally accused the ex-president and his congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro,
  of trying to interfere in Bolsonaro’s upcoming judgment by encouraging US
  officials to pressure the supreme court. A formal accusation is a prelude to
  charges being brought. The judgement is due to start on 2 September and end on
  12 September. Eduardo Bolsonaro moved to the US in February and has spent
  recent months lobbying Donald Trump’s administration – with some success – to
  pile pressure on Brazil’s supreme court justices and President Lula’s
  government over his father’s trial. In July Trump slapped 50% tariffs on
  Brazilian imports in retaliation for what he called a “witch-hunt” against
  Bolsonaro and announced sanctions against Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme
  court judge presiding over Bolsonaro’s trial. Eight of Brazil’s 11 supreme
  court judges, including Moraes, have been stripped of their US visas, as have
  the wife and 10-year-old daughter of one of Lula’s closest allies, the health
  minister Alexandre Padilha. “It’s really a political execution that they’re
  trying to do with Bolsonaro. I think that’s terrible,” Trump told reporters
  last week. In other developments on a dramatic day for Brazilian politics,
  Silas Malafaia, a powerful and wealthy evangelical pastor who is one of
  Bolsonaro’s most vocal cheerleaders, was questioned by police after flying
  back from Portugal to Rio. Malafaia, who is also being investigated by federal
  police over suspicions he too tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s
  trial, has now been banned from leaving the country, communicating with
  Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo and ordered to surrender his passports. The
  police report to the supreme court also exposed the foul-mouthed infighting
  that appears to be playing out between members of the Bolsonaro clan and key
  supporters in the lead-up to the conclusion of the ex-president’s judgment. In
  one WhatsApp exchange found on Jair Bolsonaro’s phone – which was seized as
  part of federal police investigations – Eduardo Bolsonaro reacts to an
  interview in which his father criticized him, writing in all capitals: “Go and
  fuck yourself you fucking ingrate!” In another message, from Malafaia to Jair
  Bolsonaro, the firebrand church leader attacks Eduardo Bolsonaro for publicly
  celebrating Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian imports. “I’m sorry, president. This
  son of yours Eduardo is an inexperienced prick who is handing the nationalist
  discourse to Lula and the left ... a complete idiot. I’m fuming!” In a
  statement, Eduardo Bolsonaro criticised the police for “leaking private,
  absolutely normal conversations”. He called the move “shameful” and
  politically motivated. Polls suggest Lula has received a boost in the polls
  after Trump’s attempts to pressure Brazil’s institutions, with more than 70%
  of Brazilians opposed to the US president’s actions and only 21% supporting
  them.
