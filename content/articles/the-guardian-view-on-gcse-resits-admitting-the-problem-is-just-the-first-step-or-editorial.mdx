  The Guardian view on GCSE resits: admitting the problem is just the first step

  For years, rigid rules and a shocking failure rate in compulsory GCSE retakes
  have been one of the exam system’s dirty secrets. At last this dire situation
  is getting some of the attention it deserves. This year, nearly a quarter of
  all maths and English language entries in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
  were for students aged 17 or older on a repeat attempt – with just one in six
  of those retaking maths managing to pass. By calling this a crisis, Jill
  Duffy, who heads the OCR exam board, has thrown a spotlight on the problem.
  But admitting that there is an issue with resits, as officials are now doing,
  is only the first step. There are differing views about what ought to happen
  next. Reforming GCSEs is outside the scope of the review being led by Prof
  Becky Francis. But a proposal to ditch compulsory resits is on the table. The
  Sixth Form Colleges Association wants a second attempt to be followed – for
  those who fail – by a modular alternative. This would mean students not being
  forced to endlessly repeat the parts of the courses they have mastered, and
  focusing instead on the gaps. Nick Gibb, the former Conservative schools
  minister, has predictably set his face against change and demanded that all
  schools follow the example of the best. But while big variations in results
  should be drilled into, and successes learned from, this is not an adequate
  response. Many subject experts believe that the qualifications are poorly
  designed if their purpose is to serve as a universal gateway to the world of
  work. Rather than sticking to vital competencies (such as numeracy, statistics
  and reading comprehension), the current versions include calculus and geometry
  (in maths) and quasi-literary analysis (in English language). It is a great
  shame that these issues were not grasped more effectively by Labour in
  opposition. Changes to the curriculum and exam system are a painstaking
  process. Prof Francis’s review is the best chance of breaking a destructive
  cycle. But the Department for Education’s recent record of engagement with the
  further education sector – where most resits are taken – is not good. There is
  no secondary English specialist on the review, and teacher shortages and
  challenges around provision for special educational needs and disabilities
  remain concerning. Resits must also be seen in the context of a wider debate
  around the future of post-16 education, including the pledge by ministers to
  abolish courses that they see as unwelcome competition to T-levels. As with
  resits, critics of this policy are most worried about less academically able
  pupils with lower test scores. Even the government’s own figures show a gap,
  with tens of thousands of students on the threatened courses, including some
  BTecs, potentially unsuited to newer alternatives. With a skills white paper
  due in the autumn, it is not too late to tackle unanswered questions. A better
  balance between ambition and pragmatism can surely be found. Plenty of jobs in
  the UK do not require calculus or textual analysis. T-levels were meant to
  boost less academic, more practical teenagers. This year’s resit figures are a
  worrying addition to existing evidence that these are the pupils for whom the
  system works least well. Ministers must be absolutely confident that any
  changes they introduce make things better, and not worse.
