  Ruby Rodgers didn’t expect to cry. The 14-year-old singer-songwriter and
  granddaughter of Australian rock great Jimmy Barnes had promised herself she’d
  be strong. But when she found herself surrounded by other young people voicing
  their fears about the climate crisis, she let the tears fall. “I was really
  worried people were going to see that and think I was overly sensitive,” she
  says. “But I was a child. I am a child. And I realised how important it was
  for other kids to see that it’s OK to feel deeply.” Rodgers is one of eight
  children from around the world who are featured in Future Council, a new
  documentary from Damon Gameau, the Australian director of crusading
  documentaries That Sugar Film and 2040. The film follows Gameau and the group
  of young climate activists on a road trip across Europe in a yellow school
  bus, on a mission to voice their concerns about the planet’s great
  environmental challenges in the boardrooms of some of the world’s largest and
  most powerful corporations. They ask to be heard as a council of children,
  speaking for their future. It’s a bold premise, and one that invites scrutiny.
  Can a group of children really influence multinational corporations – or a
  well-meaning but ultimately futile symbolic gesture? Gameau is aware of the
  tension. “They’re not here to save the world or understand the complexities of
  geopolitics,” he says of his young subjects. “But they bring a refreshing
  creativity and moral clarity that makes adults think differently.” Future
  Council’s most compelling scenes are not the boardroom showdowns – “You’re not
  a powerful leader, you’re a disgrace,” 12-year-old Skye tells one
  multinational executive – but the quieter, more vulnerable moments. One takes
  place by Lake Geneva, where the children, overwhelmed after a visit to the
  Nestlé corporation headquarters, are given a moment to sit and offload some
  big feelings and fears about the future of the planet. A few are in tears. One
  child walks off, unable to continue filming. It’s uncomfortable viewing. Are
  these kids being exploited? Is this just there to tug at the viewer’s
  heartstrings? Gameau is acutely aware of the responsibility he had, and has,
  to the children. “We didn’t know what was going to happen,” he says of that
  day by the lake. “It wasn’t about making them cry. It was about creating space
  for real conversations.” After having watched it with audiences, he believes
  this scene is “incredibly potent because I think the children actually give
  permission for adults to let go and have a big cry around this stuff. I feel
  like so many of us are holding this overwhelm at bay.” When the cameras
  stopped rolling, Gameau jumped into the lake, fully clothed, to break the ice
  and relieve the tension. One by one, the children and their parents followed.
  “We were carrying so much,” he says. “That moment shifted everything.” The
  production team took duty of care seriously. Each child travelled with a
  parent or guardian. A coach full of parents and crew and luggage followed the
  yellow bus. Daily wellbeing check-ins were held. The children and adults
  stayed in shared houses, cooked meals together and played outside to unwind,
  and formed what Gameau calls “a beautiful travelling circus”. Since filming
  wrapped, the support has continued. Parents received guidance on social media
  exposure and the children remain in close contact. The group travelled to the
  United Nations general assembly to screen the film and conduct a global press
  conference; now they’re in Australia together for the release (only two of the
  children are Australian). Future Council has inspired a growing youth-led
  movement, with more than 150 children around the world forming their own
  councils to collaborate on environmental solutions and advise businesses on
  sustainable practices. Ten more children joined up at a preview screening on
  the Gold Coast last week. Council members have already started working with
  Officeworks to co-design eco-friendly school supplies, with profits going to
  Future Council regeneration projects where the children vote on how the money
  is allocated – an arrangement the Future Council hopes to set up with
  companies around the world in the coming years. The council’s manifesto is
  clear-eyed. “We will not be used for media stunts, marketing spin or
  greenwashing,” it reads. “We won’t be adult-washed and we don’t accept money
  unless there’s honesty and a visible commitment to change.” Still, the
  question lingers: does Future Council give children a false sense of agency –
  an illusion of hope? Rodgers doesn’t think so. “We were completely us,” she
  says. “And I think that’s what made the corporate leaders listen. They went
  from being a brick wall to becoming more human. We got through to them on an
  emotional level.” One of the film’s most talked-about scenes takes place at
  ING, where the children challenge bank executives on their environmental
  policies. Gameau recalls the shift in the room – from corporate detachment to
  genuine engagement. “To their credit, ING leaned in,” he says. “They’ve
  offered to support the Council and introduce [the film] to 40,000 of their
  clients. Of course, there are limits to what they can do. But they saw that
  these kids have something to offer.” Rodgers, who is now 15, has since signed
  a record deal with Universal, released a single inspired by her experience and
  given a TEDx talk on the film and the movement it has inspired. Her cover of
  Coldplay’s Fix You features in the film’s trailer. It’s a haunting, hopeful
  anthem for a generation grappling with uncertainty. She’s optimistic, but not
  naive. “It can be scary, especially when people aren’t listening,” she says.
  “But being in these communities where people truly hear each other, that’s
  where change begins. I don’t think we’re pretending we have all the power. But
  we’re not powerless either.” Future Council is in Australian cinemas now.
