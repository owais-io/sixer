  The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has stared down a revolt among his
  backbench over his handling of the weekend march across the Sydney Harbour
  Bridge, with caucus agreeing to a more moderate motion acknowledging the
  protests. Members of the right and some of the left faction had sought to move
  a motion condemning the destruction of Gaza and the “Israeli government’s
  endorsement of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the territory”. It
  condemned all crimes against against humanity, including genocide, the murder
  of civilians and hostage taking. The motion also called for a recognition of
  the right to protest and called on the Minns government to begin work on
  options for a human rights bill, similar to Victoria. But the motion was
  effectively removed from consideration by caucus and a far more modest motion,
  which recognised the scale of the protests, was passed. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email About a dozen caucus members voiced their unhappiness at the
  premier’s willingness to block the march and prioritise public safety over the
  right to protest. In the first two years of his government, Minns has enjoyed
  very solid support from his party and, through his top-down style, has avoided
  outbreaks of dissent from his backbench. But the huge public turnout
  emboldened backbenchers to express their concern about Minns’ stance to block
  the protests. Police estimated 90,000 people took part, while organisers
  estimated it was closer to 300,000. Meanwhile the NSW opposition put forward a
  private member’s bill in parliament on Tuesday morning to amend the summary
  offences act, which deals with approving protests. The bill proposed to limit
  each cause to three protests a year, with organisers potentially liable to pay
  for the costs of policing if more protests were held, unless a court ruled it
  could go ahead. The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said that every dollar
  spent on managing public safety at protests meant police resources were being
  drained from domestic violence and fighting organised crime. The government
  declined to support the opposition bill. Prior to the march, 72 organisations,
  including all major NSW trade unions, civil rights organisations and community
  groups signed a letter by the Australian Democracy Network calling for the
  premier to ensure police facilitated the march going ahead, and criticising
  what they called the premier’s anti-protest agenda.
