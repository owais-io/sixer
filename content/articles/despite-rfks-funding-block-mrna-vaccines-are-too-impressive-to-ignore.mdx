  It was a blow many were braced for, yet the block on US funding for mRNA
  vaccines by Robert F Kennedy Jr’s health department has left scientists
  reeling, with some stating the move could make the world less safe. On
  Tuesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it
  would cancel $500m (£376m) in funding for mRNA vaccines, ending 22 federal
  contracts – including one with the pharmaceutical company Moderna for its bird
  flu vaccine for humans. “We’re shifting that funding toward safer, broader
  vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate,” Kennedy said
  in a statement issued on Tuesday. In many ways, it is not a surprise: Kennedy
  has long been known to be a vaccine sceptic, despite saying he is “not
  anti-vaccine”, just “pro-safety”, and has himself spread misinformation around
  immunisation, including falsely calling mRNA Covid jabs the “deadliest vaccine
  ever made”. In the statement, Kennedy said HSS had “reviewed the science,
  listened to the experts and acted,” and went on to claim mRNA vaccines failed
  to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections such as Covid and
  flu. Yet scientists have been quick to refute the claims, emphasising that
  mRNA jabs saved millions of lives during the pandemic and, contrary to
  Kennedy’s assertions, do not increase the mutation rate of viruses. “There is
  no scientific evidence that this is the case,” said Robin Shattock, professor
  of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London. “Different
  viruses mutate at different rates, for example influenza virus changes on a
  seasonal basis, Sars-CoV2 continues to vary irrespective of whether
  individuals have received mRNA vaccines.” Kennedy has spent decades
  undermining vaccine science, including championing the debunked claim that
  “autism comes from vaccines”, yet his invective towards mRNA jabs has been
  particularly potent. “It is difficult to understand why these brilliant
  innovations should be the target of anti-science sentiment. But such a
  sentiment is not logical and so difficult to explain with logic,” said Prof
  Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group that led the
  development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. What is clear is that
  since mRNA vaccines came to public attention during Covid, they have been
  mired in misinformation. Such vaccines contain messenger RNA (mRNA) – a single
  stranded molecule that carries genetic instructions that can be used by
  protein-making machinery in human cells to churn out specific proteins. As
  well as saving millions of lives in the pandemic, mRNA vaccines have huge
  potential in other areas, including cancer, with the researchers who paved the
  way for the technology winning a Nobel prize in 2023. “MRNA is important today
  especially because it allows new vaccines to be made so consistently and
  quickly in comparison with other technologies which are slower and much more
  complex to make,” said Pollard. “If there was an influenza pandemic it would
  take five to six months to make a vaccine using the traditional – and
  old-fashioned – technology of growing the vaccine virus in hen’s eggs – but it
  takes just six weeks to make millions of doses with mRNA, which can be scaled
  to tens and hundreds of millions of doses much more quickly.” Yet sceptics
  were quick to spread false claims about the vaccines – from the idea mRNA
  integrates into recipients’ DNA, to allegations such vaccines have not been
  properly safety tested. While some have suggested vaccine hesitancy is tied to
  an anti-establishment worldview, in which elites and experts are viewed with
  mistrust, others see the situation differently. “I suspect the really hardcore
  anti-vaxxers just don’t understand the science of how mRNA works,” said Dame
  Kate Bingham, who led the UK’s vaccine taskforce during the early part of the
  Covid pandemic. Pollard added that claims mRNA vaccines are new and untested
  are somewhat ridiculous. “The technology has an excellent safety record with
  some of the best ever information collected on them because of the huge
  clinical trials and, in real-world use, the availability of modern digital
  records in many countries in the pandemic,” he said, adding that while there
  were some common side effects such as a sore arm and fever, these were also
  seen with other vaccines and were not of serious consequence. And while there
  could be extremely rare side effects, such as an inflammation of the heart
  muscle known as myocarditis, these were typically transient. The new block on
  research funding has caused consternation among researchers, not least in the
  area of influenza where Pollard notes there is a constant threat of a new
  pandemic that is worse than Covid. “At this moment, the USA is dealing with a
  massive outbreak of H5N1 influenza in birds and cattle – with some spread
  already to the UK – so this is just the moment when we need more investment in
  this area before [or] in case such a virus jumps to humans,” he said. Yet not
  everyone sees only disaster. “Will this dent what’s going on in the US?
  Unquestionably. Does that mean it’s negative for the world? Not necessarily,”
  said Bingham, adding that the UK has collaborations with both BioNTech and
  Moderna – companies that work on mRNA vaccines – and has invested in the
  Centre for Process Innovation (CPI)’s new £26.4m RNA Centre of Excellence to
  develop new RNA therapies and vaccines. Such research, she said, would bring
  global benefits. “The low and middle income countries didn’t use that much
  mRNA because [such vaccines required a] -70 degree cold chain, so it was
  difficult for them to deploy it,” she said. “And so the sort of thing that CPI
  is going to be doing is, how do you actually turn those vaccines into
  thermostable vaccines that can be deployed more widely?” Pollard was less
  sanguine. “If one of the largest markets in the world decides not to invest in
  mRNA, manufacturers will be less willing to invest their own resources in the
  technology. I fear that the wider implications of this decision could be that
  the world is less safe,” he said. Experts have also warned the move could have
  implications beyond curtailing research. “While this development is not only a
  retrograde step for the development of mRNA vaccines, of greater concern,
  perhaps, is that it reinforces the impression that, in spite of his
  protestations, RFK Jr is anti-vaccine,” said Dr David Elliman, an honorary
  associate professor at UCL, adding that has implications, not only for
  vaccination programmes in the US, but around the world. “At a time when
  vaccination rates are falling globally, we need to follow the evidence, not
  ideologically led beliefs,” he said. “Such misguided beliefs are likely to
  cause unnecessary suffering and death, particularly in children.”
