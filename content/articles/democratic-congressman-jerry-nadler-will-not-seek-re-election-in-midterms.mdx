  Jerry Nadler, a Democratic representative from New York, will retire next year
  after 34 years in Congress in a self-proclaimed move aimed at galvanizing a
  generational changing of the guard in the party. Nadler, 78, who represents
  one of New York’s wealthiest districts covering midtown Manhattan, said he had
  been persuaded not to run for re-election in 2026 after witnessing the
  implosion of Joe Biden’s presidential bid last year. The former president was
  pressured into abandoning his candidacy amid widespread doubts about his age
  and mental acuity. He was replaced by the former vice-president, Kamala
  Harris, who subsequently lost the election to Donald Trump. “Watching the
  Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change
  in the party, and I think I want to respect that,” Nadler told the New York
  Times, which broke the news of his forthcoming retirement. He told the
  newspaper that a younger replacement “can maybe do better, can maybe help us
  more”. Nadler, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992,
  suggested – without naming names – that other ageing Democrats should consider
  following his lead amid a widespread call for an infusion of new blood to
  combat Trump’s “America first” agenda. “I’m not saying we should change over
  the entire party,” he said. “But I think a certain amount of change is very
  helpful, especially when we face the challenge of Trump and his incipient
  fascism.” He said he had previously hesitated to step aside at a time when he
  believes Trump is threatening the basis of US democracy. Nadler was chair of
  the House judiciary committee between 2019 and 2023 and played a leading role
  in Trump’s two impeachments during the president’s first administration. His
  decision to retire comes after a 26-year-old Rhodes scholar, Liam Elkind,
  announced in July that he would challenge him in a primary campaign. Elkind
  told CNN that he was challenging Nadler after concluding that he lacked the
  energy or mentality to rebuild the Democrats or mount an effective challenge
  to Trump. The Times cited a person familiar with Nadler’s thinking as saying
  that he would likely endorse a former aide, Micah Lasher, 43, as his
  replacement in what is anticipated to be a crowed primary field. Long seen as
  a member of the Democrats’ left-leaning wing, Nadler recently endorsed the New
  York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who won the
  party primary against more established contenders after promising a rent
  freeze and government-owned grocery stores to combat cost of living rises. The
  Democrats have met a clamor of calls for a generational shift since losing the
  White House, the House and the Senate in last year’s elections. The drumbeat
  intensified after the new Congress returned last January, when senior party
  figures sought and retained key committee roles in the face of challenges from
  younger members. In one instance, representative Gerry Connolly beat off a
  challenge from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to become the party’s ranking members
  of the House oversight committee, only to announce in April that he was
  resigning the post after a return of the cancer for which he had previously
  been successfully treated. Connolly died the following month at the age of 75.
