  Chris Froome has been airlifted to hospital after suffering a collapsed lung
  and breaking his back and five ribs during a serious crash while training in
  France. The four-time Tour de France winner’s team confirmed that Froome would
  undergo surgery in Toulon on Thursday after the incident which took place on
  Wednesday. It said that the 40-year-old was now stable, and that no one else
  had been involved in the crash. “Chris was airlifted to hospital in Toulon
  yesterday afternoon following a serious training crash,” a statement posted on
  Froome’s X account said. “No other cyclists or vehicles were involved.
  “Fortunately, Chris is stable and did not sustain any head injuries, however,
  scans have confirmed a pneumothorax, five broken ribs, and a lumbar vertebrae
  fracture, for which he will undergo surgery this afternoon. “We will update on
  Chris’ condition following surgery.” It is the second serious training crash
  in Froome’s career, during which he has won the Tour de France in 2013, 2015,
  2016 and 2017 as well as the Vuelta a España in 2011 and 2017 and the Giro
  d’Italia in 2018. In 2019, Froome was left in intensive care after a freak
  accident while travelling at 37mph during a reconnaissance ride at the
  Critérium du Dauphiné. The incident occurred when Froome took his hand off his
  handlebars to blow his nose before a gust of wind destabilised his bike. He
  then crashed into a wall and lost consciousness. After being airlifted to
  hospital, Froome was discovered to have fractured his right femur and suffered
  a broken hip, as well as a fractured elbow and fractured ribs, and later
  admitted he was “lucky to be alive”. The Israel-Premier Tech rider, who is out
  of contract at the end of the year, is expected to miss the remainder of the
  season with his injuries.
