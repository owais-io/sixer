  Fashion is a vocabulary. Clothing communicates parts of who we are, what we
  are interested in and how we want to be seen. It reveals choices that we make
  – but it also exposes lack of choice. I am a disabled woman; I have dwarfism.
  My disability and stature is obvious and often shapes a first interaction.
  I’ve learned to love scouring through rails of clothes in high street stores
  and charity shops, and taking the items for alterations to make sure they fit.
  I know that if there are patterns or embroidery near the shoulder or ankle of
  a garment, altering it won’t work. I’ve found that jeans and trousers have to
  be elasticated at the back so they go over my hips with ease and don’t gape at
  the back. I’ve also learned that dresses and skirts should have an
  asymmetrical hemline to accommodate the curve in my spine. As I’ve got older,
  I’ve discovered that many of these alterations don’t just work for me, but
  would also improve comfort, independence and dressing for most people.
  Accessible design is better design. To show you what this looks like in
  action: I recently had the pleasure of attending a dinner to mark Jannik
  Sinner’s return to Wimbledon. Beforehand, I was nervous. I wanted to wear
  something that would instil confidence, be comfortable and allow me to move
  about with personality and dignity. I chose a blazer, cashmere jumper and
  black pants. During my time working in fashion, I had the privilege of
  building relationships with designers, and this jacket was custom-made by
  Gucci. The pocket is proportional and the buttons are deliberately placed to
  be mindful of my figure. The wool pants are also custom-made by Prada and
  close with a fastener and zip, rather than a button, to avoid dexterity
  issues, and the back of the waistband is elasticated. The jumper is from
  Johnstons of Elgin in Scotland – their store is step-free and has rails at
  multiple levels. I chose it because it needed no alterations; the short-sleeve
  is mid‑length for me, and wearable throughout the year. I’ve spent almost a
  decade working in the luxury fashion industry, because I want more choice,
  more representation and more respect for disabled customers – and across the
  industry there is lots to celebrate. The Victoria and Albert Museum currently
  has an exhibition called Design and Disability, curated by Natalie Kane, that
  shows the innovation in accessibility. It features the work of Victoria
  Jenkins, the disabled designer behind Unhidden, a leading adaptive brand that
  will be part of this year’s official London Fashion Week. Tommy Hilfiger has
  an adaptive collection, Liberare creates bras that close at the front rather
  than the back, Tilt Beauty has a line of products that allow you to put
  mascara on with greater ease, and Primark has increased representation in the
  in-store mannequins and begun to make their childrenswear range seam- and
  label-free for neurodivergent kids. But, we need to think of disabled people
  as more than customers. In 2020, I founded Tilting the Lens, a strategic
  accessibility consultancy that aims to create the conditions for disabled
  people to be successful. We’ve developed a scholarship for disabled designers
  with Parsons School of Design in New York, and we’ve spent the past year
  undertaking research with more than 200 disabled people across the UK to
  develop a white paper on adaptive fashion, to improve understanding of the
  market and innovation opportunities. We’ve learned so much about making
  clothing more inclusive, but also the need for stores and real estate, packing
  and delivery to be accessible, too. I want disabled people to be valued
  consumers – but for that to happen they also need to be decision-makers,
  leaders and trustees.
