  At the start of Three Days in June, Gail Baines, a 61-year-old teacher, has a
  meeting with her school head, who informs her she is about to retire. Gail
  assumes she is next in line for the job, but the head tells her she doesn’t
  have the people skills and asks if she has considered retirement herself.
  Affronted, she walks out of the school and from her job without collecting the
  photo on her desk of her daughter, Debbie, who is about to get married. After
  Gail gets home, her ex-husband, Max, arrives. He is staying with her for the
  wedding weekend and tells her he has forgotten to bring a suit – although he
  has brought a cat. Not for the first time, Gail wonders “why it was that I had
  so many irritating people in my life”. Set in Baltimore, Anne Tyler’s novella
  spans the before, during and after of Debbie’s wedding. Told through Gail’s
  eyes, the plot is deliberately slim as it explores subtle family dynamics and
  the mundanity of everyday life. Thus, we accompany Gail as she collects her
  outfit from the dry cleaners and visits a hair stylist with whom she declines
  to make small talk. J Smith Cameron, best known for her role as Gerri in
  Succession, is the narrator, and adeptly captures Gail’s social awkwardness
  that, unbeknown to her, can come over as chilly and detached. As she ponders
  the breakdown of her marriage to Max, we see that the headteacher had a point.
  Although we root for Gail and her future happiness, it is clear her people
  skills need work. • Available via Penguin Audio, 4hr 24min Further listening
