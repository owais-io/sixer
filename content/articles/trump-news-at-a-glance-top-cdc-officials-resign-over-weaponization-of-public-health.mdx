  The leading US public health agency faced a number of top-level resignations
  on Wednesday after its director was ousted from her job, with one departing
  official reportedly saying he was leaving “because of the ongoing
  weaponization of public health”. US officials announced CDC director Susan
  Monarez had left her role just weeks after being sworn in. This was followed
  by the resignations of three senior CDC officials – Dr Debra Houry, the chief
  medical officer, Dr Daniel Jernigan, director of the National Center for
  Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and Dr Demetre Daskalakis, director
  of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Daskalakis
  told colleagues “I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the
  ongoing weaponization of public health”, according to an email obtained by
  STAT, a health news site. Houry echoed his concerns and wrote that “ongoing
  changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency”,
  adding that science should “never be censored or subject to political
  interpretations”. Here is the key Trump administration news of the day. CDC
  director ousted after less than a month in job Reporting from the Washington
  Post and the New York Times indicated that Susan Monarez ran afoul of Robert F
  Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, after she declined to commit to fully
  support changing the coronavirus vaccine policy. Monarez was the agency’s 21st
  director and the first to pass through Senate confirmation following a 2023
  law. She was named acting director in January and then tapped as the nominee
  in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Read
  the full story Tony Blair attends White House meeting with Trump on postwar
  Gaza Former British prime minister Tony Blair has attended a White House
  meeting with Donald Trump to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, the Guardian
  understands. After stepping down as prime minister in 2007, Blair took on the
  role of Middle East envoy until 2015 and spent time in Jerusalem trying to
  formulate a plan for a two-state solution. The former Labour leader, 72, was
  in Washington DC on Wednesday for the meeting with Trump. The Axios website
  reported that Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser, Jared Kushner, was
  also in attendance. Read the full story Judge blocks Trump administration from
  deporting Kilmar Ábrego García again A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that
  Kilmar Ábrego García, who was already wrongfully deported once, cannot be
  deported again until at least early October, according to multiple reports.

  homeless camps National guard troops have spent their last days of the summer
  mulching cherry trees, collecting trash and clearing homeless camps across
  Washington DC, as Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the capital evolved the

  How hard will Trump’s tariff hit India, and what is Delhi doing about it?
  Donald Trump’s tariffs of 50% have come into force on most US imports from
  India. The US president followed through on his threat to punish one of the
  world’s largest economies for its purchases of discounted Russian oil. We
  explain how hard the tariffs will hit India and what it might do about that.
  Read the full story What else happened today: Republicans in California are
  proposing a “two-state solution” for the Golden state, in a move that is
  unlikely to go anywhere but is reflective of partisan divisions amid a
  nationwide battle over control of Congress. The US Food and Drug
  Administration has approved updated Covid vaccines but has placed new
  restrictions on who can get them. Florida’s immigration jail known as
  “Alligator Alcatraz” will probably be empty of detainees within days, a state
  official has said, indicating compliance with a judge’s order last week that
  the facility must close. The Fulton county commission in Georgia will be fined
  $10,000 a day for violating a court order to appoint two Republicans
  associated with Trump-aligned groups pushing voter fraud conspiracies to the
  county’s election board. Catching up? Here’s what happened 26 August 2025.
