  As I drive north through Angus, birch and rowan begin to replace ash and oak,
  and by the time I reach the foot of the glen, the purple-streaked tops of the
  Cairngorms have come into view. Glenisla is the last lowland valley before the
  mountains begin, and it’s home to a rare sight on either side of the Highland
  line: a thatched roof. The building is a lodge house on the Knockshannoch
  estate, and is believed to be the only remaining thatched roundhouse in
  Scotland. I’ve driven three hours north from the Scottish Borders to repair a
  hole in its roof (Scottish thatchers are few and far between, so travelling
  long distances is not unusual here). As I set to work, I’m met with the
  dreaded sight of wasps rising out of the thatch – I’ve uncovered a byke. A
  calm approach can prevent the slide towards mutual destruction, so I suppress
  the urge to swat them with my thatching leggett – a sort of large comb. After
  some half-hearted dive-bombing, the wasps lose interest, returning to their
  business as I attend to mine, gently teasing some new reed into position by
  their nest. I tighten the thatch on to the battens with “screw wires” – wood
  screws with two long wire attachments. The tool I use was originally designed
  to fasten potato sacks, one of many mongrel borrowings you find in thatching.
  With the thatch secure, I clamber down the ladder for a cup of tea. The
  homeowners, Pam and Mark, tell me that it’s been a bad wasp year (or a good
  one, depending on your perspective) – they’ve already had three bykes removed.
  Wildlife is never far away here: a heron nested in a neighbouring pine tree
  this spring and a pine marten has been a regular visitor to the garden. A few
  years ago, Pam found a bedraggled kitten sheltering from a summer deluge under
  the deep eaves of the thatch. It turned out to be a Scottish wildcat (a
  domestic cat hybrid, as most remaining wildcats are). I finish my tea and
  prepare a length of chicken wire to cover the patch of new reed. This is a
  normal precaution against bird damage, but it should also help deter the
  beaks, teeth and claws of this glen’s other wildlife. • Under the Changing
