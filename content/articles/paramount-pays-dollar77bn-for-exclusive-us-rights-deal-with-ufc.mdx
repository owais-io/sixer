  Paramount has struck a $7.7bn (£5.7bn) deal to become the exclusive US
  broadcaster of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, just days after its
  controversial merger with Skydance Media. Under the seven-year deal with the
  sports group’s parent company, TKO Group, all 13 of UFC’s marquee numbered
  events and 30 Fight Nights a year will be streamed on the Paramount+ service,
  with a selected number also simulcast on CBS, from next year. The agreement
  will mean the end of UFC’s current pay-per-view model on the Disney-owned
  ESPN+ service. The deal comes a week after David Ellison took over as chair
  and chief executive following Skydance’s $8.4bn takeover of the Hollywood
  studio and broadcasting business, with the media company saying it may pursue
  UFC rights in other markets as they come up for renewal. “Live sports continue
  to be a cornerstone of our broader strategy,” said Ellison. “[It drives]
  engagement, subscriber growth and long-term loyalty. The addition of UFC’s
  year-round must-watch events to our platforms is a major win.” Paramount is
  paying $1.1bn on average annually to TKO Group for the rights and will offer
  all the matches at no additional cost to consumers. Mark Shapiro, president
  and chief operating officer at TKO, said: “Paramount is a platinum partner
  with significant reach. Our new agreement unlocks powerful opportunities at
  TKO for years to come.” UFC is led by Dana White, an ally of the US president,
  Donald Trump, who spoke at his victory rally in Washington DC in January. He
  is also a board member of Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram. Ellison,
  the 42-year-old son of the multibillionaire co-founder of Oracle, Larry
  Ellison, is working with Paramount’s other co-owner, RedBird Capital, to cut
  $2bn in costs from the business. RedBird, which is run by Gerry Cardinale, is
  also in the process of pushing through a £500m takeover of the Telegraph. The
  rights deal follows completion of the protracted merger of Paramount Global
  and Skydance Media, a process which drew regulatory and political scrutiny and
  raised concerns among some investors. Last month Paramount Global agreed to
  pay $16m to settle a legal dispute with Trump over what the president claimed
  was misleading editing of a pre-election interview on its CBS News network
  with the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. While CBS initially called the
  lawsuit “completely without merit”, its parent company decided to settle. CBS
  also cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert days after the eponymous
  host said the settlement by the network’s parent company was a “bribe”.
  Paramount owns assets including MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Showtime and
  Channel 5 in the UK. The film studio has produced Hollywood blockbusters
  including Top Gun: Maverick, as well as the Mission: Impossible and Star Trek
  franchises.
