  Keir Starmer’s asylum plans have been plunged into turmoil after a high court
  ruling blocked people seeking refuge from being housed in an Essex hotel.
  Epping Forest district council was granted an interim injunction on Tuesday to
  stop asylum seekers from being placed at the Bell hotel, following continuing
  protests nearby. Thousands of people, including some rightwing agitators, have
  gathered near the hotel in recent weeks after an asylum seeker living there
  was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the town. Ministers
  are bracing for dozens of legal challenges from other council leaders after
  the ruling. Home Office lawyers warned the court that the decision could
  “substantially impact” the government’s ability to house asylum seekers in
  hotels across the UK. There were about 200 hotels housing about 30,000 asylum
  seekers at the end of March. Insiders at the Home Office admitted the
  department had been left “reeling” by the ruling. The department is obliged to
  house asylum seekers until their cases are assessed. Reacting to the judgment,
  the border security minister, Angela Eagle, said: “We will carefully consider
  this judgment. As this matter remains subject to ongoing legal proceedings it
  would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.” Mr Justice Eyre
  granted the injunction after hearing the local council’s complaints that
  planning law had been breached in changing the site’s use. Epping district
  council also cited disruption caused by the protests and concerns for the
  safety of the asylum seekers themselves. Sitting at the Royal Courts of
  Justice on Tuesday, the judge agreed with the council that an urgent order was
  required to stop the hotel housing asylum seekers. He said the hotel’s owner,
  Somani Hotels, had until 12 September to comply. The hotel has been at the
  centre of violent far-right protests since an asylum seeker was charged with
  sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu has denied
  charges against him and is due to stand trial later this month. A second man
  who was staying at the site, Mohammed Sharwarq, a Syrian national, has
  separately been charged with seven offences, while several men have been
  charged over alleged disorder outside the hotel. Before the ruling was handed
  down, the judge declined a last-minute application from the home secretary to
  intervene. A barrister for the home secretary argued that a ruling in the
  council’s favour would have a substantial impact on her statutory duty to
  house asylum seekers while their cases are considered, among other concerns.
  But the judge said the home secretary’s intervention was unnecessary and would
  merely use up court time. Speaking after Tuesday’s ruling, the council’s
  leader, Chris Whitbread, said: “I am delighted. This is great news for our
  residents. The last few weeks have placed an intolerable strain on our
  community but today we have some great news. This is not the end of the
  matter. Having obtained an interim provision, the next stage is for the
  council to return to the court and seek a permanent injunction.” Since 2020,
  there has been greater reliance on hotels to house asylum seekers, with 32,345
  being housed temporarily in England and Wales at the end of March this year.
  Labour has promised to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029
  by cutting small boat crossings and building new government-owned
  accommodation. Enver Solomon, the Refugee Council’s chief executive, said:
  “The use of hotels is completely unsustainable – and this ruling shows that
  the government’s plan to wait until 2029 to end their use is not viable.
  “Through our frontline work we see how protests and hostility leave people who
  have fled war and persecution feeling terrified and targeted in the very
  places they are forced to live. This makes an already traumatising situation
  worse and robs people of any sense of safety. “Instead of relying on costly
  hotels, the Home Office should partner with local councils to provide safe,
  cost-effective accommodation within communities. But to end hotel use for
  good, the government needs to think differently about how we can speed up and
  improve asylum decision-making.” The council said last week it was seeking the
  injunction due to “unprecedented levels of protest and disruption” in
  connection with asylum seeker accommodation. Whitbread had said the situation
  “cannot go on” but the government was not listening. At a hearing on Friday,
  barristers for the council said the site’s “sole lawful use” was as a hotel
  and that Somani Hotels had breached planning rules by using it to house asylum
  seekers. Philip Coppel KC, for the authority, said the situation was “wholly
  unacceptable” and had provided a “feeding ground for unrest”. He said: “There
  has been what can be described as an increase in community tension, the
  catalyst of which has been the use of the Bell hotel to place asylum seekers.
  It is not the asylum seekers who are acting unlawfully. It is the defendant,
  by allowing the hotel to be used to house asylum seekers.” He added: “It
  really could not be much worse than this.” One council leader said he would
  gather “more detail about what Epping has done” before considering a bid to
  shut down another hotel thought to be housing asylum seekers. Corina Gander,
  the Conservative leader of the borough of Broxbourne council, said crowds had
  gathered in protest outside the Cheshunt Marriott hotel in Hertfordshire,
  about six miles from the Bell hotel in Epping. Gander said the high court’s
  decision had set a “massive precedent” and added: “It’s just given us this
  massive boost and precedent that we can do something now.” Nigel Farage, the
  leader of Reform UK, hailed the high court decision in Epping as a victory and
  said he hoped it “provides inspiration to others across the country”. The
  Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, suggested those housed at the hotel “need
  to be moved out of the area immediately”, while the shadow home secretary,
  Chris Philp, said “residents should never have had to fight their own
  government just to feel safe in their own town”.
