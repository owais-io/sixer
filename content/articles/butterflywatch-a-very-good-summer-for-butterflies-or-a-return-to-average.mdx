  Is it a superlative summer for butterflies or simply a return to normal?
  Plenty of nature-lovers have delighted in the abundance of gatekeepers, red
  admirals and peacocks this year, particularly after the dire summer of 2024,
  the second worst for common butterflies since scientific records began in
  1976. We won’t know the answer until results from the Big Butterfly Count come
  in – add your 15-minute butterfly counts in your local green space using the
  free app or website until 10 August. Confirmation will come when UKBMS data is
  crunched early next year. My butterfly counts in Norfolk this week have been
  better than recent years but the nine peacocks on my garden buddleia is fewer
  than I counted in 2021. So I suspect a return to average. For a truly vintage
  summer, as the naturalist Matthew Oates points out, we require several
  reliably good years in a row. Then flying insect numbers really boom. He notes
  this happened in the late 1940s and again in 1974, 1975, 1976 as well as 1982,
  1983, 1984 and, to a lesser extent, 1994, 1995, 1996. This century, we’ve
  experienced scattered decent butterfly summers – 2003, 2006, 2009, 2013 and
  2018 – but no consolidation of good years. The fluctuations of global heating
  will probably thwart a run of truly brilliant butterfly summers but here’s
  hoping 2025 is start of something.
