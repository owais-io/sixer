  In 2010, Gerardo Ceballos and a group of other researchers set out to answer a
  burning question: how many jaguars were there in Mexico? They knew there
  weren’t many. Hunting, loss of habitat, conflict with cattle ranchers and
  other issues had pushed the population to the brink of extinction. Ceballos
  and his team from the National Alliance for Jaguar Conservation (ANCJ) thought
  there were maybe 1,000 jaguars across the country. They decided to carry out
  the country’s first census of the animal to find out exactly how many there
  were. They found 4,100. “It was a great surprise, terrific news,” Ceballos
  said. “Obviously 4,000 means the species is still in danger of extinction, but
  4,000 is a lot better than 1,000.” Fast-forward 15 years and the news has got
  even better. The group’s latest census found that in 2024 there were 5,326
  jaguars in Mexico, a 30% increase compared with 2010. “The fact that the
  country has managed to maintain and increase its population over the last 14
  years is extraordinary,” Ceballos said. “For me it’s great news for the
  country. Mexico and the world need good news.” The census took place over 90
  days across 15 states, using 920 motion-capture cameras and involving nearly
  50 researchers as well as local community leaders. Researchers looked at an
  area of 414,000 hectares, making it the largest census for any mammal in
  Mexico. Jaguars were found across the country, with the largest number in the
  Yucatán peninsula region (1,699), followed by the south Pacific area (1,541),
  north-east and central Mexico (813), the north Pacific (733) and the central
  Pacific coast (540). Ceballos credits three main factors for the population
  increase: maintaining natural protected areas where jaguars can roam freely,
  reducing the conflict between cattle ranchers and jaguars, and a publicity
  campaign that has put the jaguar on the map. “Before when we started, the
  jaguar was virtually unknown,” Ceballos said. “Right now it’s one of the most
  well-known species” in Mexico. Still, at the current rate of population
  increase it would take 25 to 30 years for the jaguar to no longer be
  considered at risk of extinction in Mexico. Ceballos and his team aim to
  reduce that time to just 15 years. There are many challenges in their way.
  Deforestation and loss of habitat continue to be a major issue: Mexico has
  lost 600,000 hectares of forest and jungle in the last six years. In the
  Yucatán peninsula alone, the country loses 60,000 hectares of forest and
  jungle each year, vastly reducing the areas in which the jaguar can live and
  hunt. “On the one hand it’s a travesty,” said Ceballos. “But on the other
  hand, it means that where there are still jungles and forests, the populations
  are growing.” Ceballos said there was also a thriving online marketplace for
  jaguar teeth, skin and claws, among other body parts. He hopes to work with
  social media companies to have pages marketing such products taken down. The
  construction of new highways is a continuing challenge. Not only do they
  fragment a jaguar’s territory but they increase the risk of the animals being
  run over. This can be mitigated by building specific points where animals such
  as jaguars can cross safely. There is continuing conflict with cattle
  ranchers, and the spread of diseases from domesticated animals also poses a
  threat to the jaguar population. Ceballos said a greater financial commitment
  to conservation from the federal government was needed, as well as support
  from the private sector, from scientists and from landowners to protect areas
  where jaguars may be living, if they were to meet their goal. “We are winning
  a battle in a war that is being lost. But it is a very important battle,” he
  said. “It gives us hope that if we articulate the right policies, we can
  achieve great results.”
