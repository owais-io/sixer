  Ziad Rahbani, who has died aged 69 of a heart attack, was a national hero in
  Lebanon. A composer, pianist, playwright, actor and political commentator, he
  shook up the Beirut theatre scene with his controversial musical plays and
  transformed his country’s popular music with his bravely original fusion of
  Middle Eastern and western styles. In the process he also transformed the
  career of his mother, Nouhad Haddad, better known as Fairuz, the most beloved
  singer in the Arab world. Fairuz had a vast following across the Middle East
  and North Africa, sold more than 150m records and performed in musical plays
  and films. Ziad’s father, Assi Rahbani, was a pioneering composer who, working
  with his brother, Mansour, as “the Rahbani Brothers” had written many of the
  songs made famous by Fairuz. She was initially best known for stories of
  Lebanese pastoral life, love and loss. Ziad proved that his mother could
  broaden her musical range and tackle wider, more adventurous themes. In 1979,
  at the age of 22, he produced her album Wahdon, hailed as a turning point in
  her career. It included Ziad’s funky composition Al Bostah (The Bus), in which
  a man remembers a bus journey with a woman he loved – and her remarkable eyes.
  It shocked some of his mother’s more conservative followers, but became a
  dancefloor hit. After his father’s death in 1986 he became her main
  songwriter, responsible for other successful albums including Maarifti Feek
  (1987), which showcased Ziad’s jazz and funk influences. A musician with
  widely eclectic tastes, he was a fan of American jazz stars including Charlie
  Parker, Stan Getz and Dizzy Gillespie, and though he used western influences
  in many of his songs, his music remained distinctively Lebanese. He once
  described his style as “oriental jazz – or something like a hamburger that
  tastes of falafel”. Kifak Inta (1991) took the eclectic mix even further,
  blending jazz and funk with Brazilian influences. The title track tells of a
  woman confessing to her love of a married childhood sweetheart – and it again
  startled some Fairuz fans. As well as composing and producing albums for his
  mother, Ziad performed with her. So when she played at the Royal Festival
  Hall, London, in 1986 (later released as a live album), Ziad was in the band,
  accompanying her on the piano. He also enjoyed a wildly adventurous solo
  career, much of it based around political satire and musical theatre. His
  first play, Sahriyya (1973), was much in the folklore style of the Rahbani
  Brothers, but with Nazl el-Sourour (1974) he branched out, telling the story
  of an unemployed betting addict. Ziad appeared in the play, which was praised
  for its music, humour and use of Beirut street slang. Much of his work during
  the long years of the Lebanese civil war (1975-90) reflected Beirut life in
  this era. Bennesbeh Labokra Chou? (1978) was set in a bar and included the
  celebrated line: “They say tomorrow will be better, but what about today?”
  Film Ameriki Tawil (1980) also reflected the anxiety and confusion of the era
  with a story set in a psychiatric hospital – with Ziad playing a militiaman.
  The play ends with him screaming. The war also influenced one of his
  best-known albums, Ana Moush Kafer (1985). The British musician and global
  music exponent Lu Edmonds describes the slinky, oud-backed title track as “a
  masterpiece – it should be on everyone’s playlist, and the lyrics should be
  translated into 100 languages…” It starts with the line: “I am not the
  infidel, but hunger is the infidel.” Edmonds remembers meeting Ziad in 1993
  and that he was “very funny, with a very dry wicked sense of humour”. They
  started drinking vodka at 10am, and discussed music, technology and their
  shared love of the Algerian pianist Maurice el Médioni until Ziad had to leave
  for an afternoon theatre performance. Fairuz refused to perform in Lebanon
  during the civil war, to avoid the appearance of taking sides, but her son
  took a very different approach, performing in Beirut throughout the conflict.
  A self-declared communist, he was an active supporter of the Palestinian
  struggle for statehood, and had been influenced by witnessing the 1976
  massacre of Palestinians by rightwing Christian militias at the Tel el-Zaatar
  refugee camp. He moved from Christian-dominated east Beirut to live in a
  Muslim area of the city. Ziad was born and grew up in Antelias, a few miles
  north of Beirut, and was educated at a Jesuit school, Collège Notre-Dame de
  Jamhour. He was already writing songs by the time he was a teenager, and at 17
  made his acting debut, appearing in a play by the Rahbani Brothers in which
  his mother played the lead. In the same year, he wrote the music for a lyric
  by his uncle Mansour, when his father was in hospital. Sa’alouni Al Nas was
  the first of his compositions to be sung by his mother. His marriage to Dalal
  Karam ended in divorce. He is survived by Fairuz, and by his brother, Hali,
  and sister, Reema. • Ziad Rahbani, musician and playwright, born 1 January
  1956; died 26 July 2025 • This article was amended on 10 and 13 August 2025.
  Some details of Ziad Rahbani’s divorce have been removed. And Al Bostah (The
  Bus) is not about a woman remembering a journey with her lover. Rather, a man
  remembers a bus journey with a woman he loved, and her remarkable eyes.
