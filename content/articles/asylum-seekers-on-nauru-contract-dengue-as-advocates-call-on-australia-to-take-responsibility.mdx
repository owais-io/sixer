  At least nine asylum seekers on Nauru have contracted dengue fever amid an
  outbreak on the island, including one man who was medically evacuated to
  Australia for treatment and then returned this week, according to a legal aid
  group and an asylum seeker there. Cases of dengue, also known as break-bone
  fever, rose sharply in July amid a broader outbreak of the virus in the
  Pacific. The infection is transmitted through mosquito bites, and those with
  symptoms can experience a high fever, body aches, headache and nausea. Severe
  cases may require hospitalisation, and in extreme cases lead to death. Those
  infected a second time are at even greater risk of severe dengue. Nauru’s
  president, David Adeang, said last week he was “overwhelmed by the increased
  number of dengue fever cases”, including among families and children. Sign up:
  AU Breaking News email Two children died of dengue in Nauru on Wednesday, the
  government said in a public statement on social media. “The health of our
  community depends on the actions we take now,” Adeang said. “This rapid spread
  of dengue requires every one of us to unite.” Heidi Abdel-Raouf, the manager
  of detention casework advocacy at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC),
  said the group was aware of nine men who have dengue “but there are reports of
  many more”. There are approximately 93 asylum seekers and refugees on Nauru,
  who mostly live in the community on a stipend of $230 a fortnight from the
  Australian government. They have been there between two and 22 months, and
  will never be settled in Australia under government policies. Those with
  refugee status currently have no resettlement options. “Many of the men have
  pre-existing health conditions, which mean that the illness that they have
  with dengue is just compounding,” Abdel-Raouf said. “We know from the history
  of offshore detention that … due to indefinite detention and poor living
  conditions and limited and inadequate healthcare services, that detention
  effectively makes people really unwell.” An asylum seeker on Nauru told the
  Guardian he was diagnosed with dengue four or five days ago. He said through
  an interpreter that he still had a fever, his entire body was painful and he
  could not eat. He was taken to a facility for blood tests and told to take two
  tablets of Panadol every six hours after his diagnosis. There is no specific
  treatment for dengue and doctors generally advise the use of analgesics to
  control pain. “I am very concerned because I don’t think the medication,
  Panadol, will be helping me, especially because I cannot eat,” he said. “It’s
  hard to move around, I don’t have enough strength because I cannot eat enough,
  so I am very concerned.” Accessing mosquito nets, he said, was “impossible”.
  “There are no mosquito nets available anywhere in Nauru.” The ASRC said some
  of the men on Nauru who were sick with dengue had reported difficulties
  getting enough paracetamol to deal with the pain caused by the virus, with
  some reporting receiving 10 tablets when they required at least 30 to help
  manage a few days of sickness. Abdel-Raouf also said the men had difficulty
  accessing Hydralyte and fruit and vegetables to aid their recovery. The asylum
  seeker who spoke to the Guardian said in his case he had been given enough
  Panadol to comply with his doctor’s treatment plan. The ASRC also said some of
  the men had requested mosquito repellant and insect netting but authorities
  and case managers were not able to help them. “Some men were particularly
  concerned because they live in a jungle-like area, with a higher number of
  mosquitoes, a higher chance of getting dengue,” Abdel-Raouf said. Guardian
  Australia contacted the Australian Border Force for comment on medical
  supplies and insect control measures provided to those on Nauru, as well as
  figures on the number of people sickened with dengue. The Nauru government did
  not reply to a request for comment on the outbreak. The Department of Home
  Affairs said it was aware cases of dengue fever were rising in Nauru, adding
  it is following the lead of the country’s government “to coordinate the
  response to the dengue outbreak”. A spokesperson said transfer to Australia
  for temporary treatment “may occur on a case-by case-basis depending on
  individual circumstances where necessary medical treatment is not available on
  Nauru or to support engagement with third country migration options”. The
  department added that transitory persons “do not have a settlement pathway in
  Australia”. The Department of Foreign Affairs’ website notes that severe
  dengue fever is rare but “a medical emergency that needs hospital treatment”.
  Islands across the Pacific including Samoa, Fiji and Kiribati all reported
  high numbers of dengue cases in recent weeks. At least two people died in
  Samoa in the latest outbreak. Abdel-Raouf said the situation on Nauru would
  only grow worse the longer people seeking asylum in Australia remained there.
  “The health system on Nauru is already fragile and easily overwhelmed – it
  will struggle to cope with this outbreak,” she said. “Australia has a clear
  responsibility for the refugees our government has banished there.” A UN
  watchdog ruled in January that Australia had violated the rights of asylum
  seekers detained on Nauru, finding a nation “cannot escape its human rights
  responsibility when outsourcing asylum processing to another state”. Australia
  has maintained it is not responsible for the treatment of asylum seekers of
  refugees there, saying it works “closely” with the country to “support the
  provision of health, welfare and support services”.
