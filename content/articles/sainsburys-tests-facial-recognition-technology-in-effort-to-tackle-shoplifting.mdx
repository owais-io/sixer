  shoplifting

  Sainsbury’s has begun testing the use of controversial facial recognition
  technology in its UK shops as part of efforts to tackle shoplifters. The UK’s
  second largest supermarket chain told staff in two stores – a supermarket in
  Sydenham, south-east London, and convenience store in Oldfield Park in Bath–
  that it was starting an eight-week trial before potentially rolling out the
  technology nationwide. Sainsbury’s has said the technology is part of its
  efforts to identify shoplifters and curb a sharp increase in retail crime in
  recent years, but privacy campaigners condemned the plans as “chilling”. The
  number of shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales rose
  last year to the highest level on record, according to the latest official
  figures released in April, surpassing half a million offences for the first
  time. Use of facial recognition in shops has been heavily criticised in recent
  years, with rival Asda facing thousands of complaints after launching its own
  similar trial earlier this year. A Metropolitan police plan to widen the use
  of live facial recognition technology at “mass events” was criticised by the
  equalities regulator as unlawful last month, after research indicated that
  black men were proportionally more likely to trigger an alert. The Equality
  and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said its use was intrusive and could have a
  “chilling effect” on individuals’ rights. Bosses at Sainsbury’s, which has
  more than 1,400 shops across the country, said the planned rollout was “not
  about monitoring colleagues” or customers. The supermarket chain is working
  with the facial recognition business Facewatch as part of the trial. Fellow
  retailers Home Bargains, Flannels, Costcutter and Sports Direct have
  reportedly used similar Facewatch technology in stores to identify
  shoplifters. Sainbury’s said the technology would be used to help it identify
  and potentially ban people who are “violent, aggressive or steal in the
  store”. The company said records would be deleted instantly if the software
  did not recognise the face of reported individuals. It added that the system
  issued an alert based on criminal behaviour submitted by the store or other
  retailers using Facewatch nearby. Madeleine Stone, the senior advocacy officer
  at the privacy group Big Brother Watch, told PA Media: “Sainsbury’s decision
  to trial Orwellian facial recognition technology in its shops is deeply
  disproportionate and chilling. “Sainsbury’s should abandon this trial and the
  government must urgently step in to prevent the unchecked spread of this
  invasive technology.” Sainsbury’s said incidents of theft, abuse and
  threatening behaviour “continue to rise” despite working with the police and
  the government, adding that it was “affecting Sainsbury’s teams across the UK
  daily”. Simon Roberts, the retailer’s chief executive, said: “We have listened
  to the deep concerns our colleagues and customers have and they’re right to
  expect us to act. The retail sector is at a crossroads, facing rising abuse,
  antisocial behaviour and violence. We must put safety first. “We understand
  that facial recognition technology can raise valid questions about data and
  privacy. This trial and subsequent rollout is not about monitoring colleagues
  or our valued customers. “It’s focused solely on identifying serious offenders
  who have committed acts of violence, aggression or theft, helping our teams
  prevent further harm.” Joanne Thomas, the general secretary of the Usdaw
  union, said: “We welcome Sainsbury’s ongoing programme of work to protect
  retail workers and customers from the continued threat of abuse and violence
  in stores. “We look forward to seeing the results of the trial of facial
  recognition software and will continue to work closely with Sainsbury’s to
  support a responsible, evidence-led approach to tackling retail crime.”
