  The call was unexpected but it brought good news: Bruce Stanwyck* was told
  that the monthly payments for his O2 phone contract would be reduced from £19
  to £12 if he switched to a new deal. Stanwyck, a pensioner, accepted the offer
  there and then. That was the start of an elaborate scam that nearly cost him
  his savings. The day after the call, Stanwyck received a message from O2
  confirming dispatch of a £1,000 iPhone 16 Pro Max handset. Perplexed, he
  called O2 to remonstrate. He told the company that a new handset had not been
  mentioned as part of the deal, and he didn’t want it. Nonetheless, the phone
  was delivered two days later. Stanwyck called O2 to reject it and was told he
  would be sent a prepaid bag to return it in. The next morning there was a
  knock on the door, and Stanwyck handed over the unopened box to the caller,
  who said he was a courier sent by O2. “I didn’t think about the fact that I
  had not been given a receipt until later, and that did worry me,” he says.
  Three days later, the promised returns bag arrived from O2. Alarmed, Stanwyck
  called customer services and says he was assured the handset had been
  received. What happened next threatened his good name and his savings. A
  letter from O2 informed him that it was terminating his contract and referring
  him to its fraud department. It told him to pay £1,072 within 14 days. It
  transpired the phone had vanished – the courier was nothing to do with O2.
  “Now I am classed as a thief and owe money I don’t have for a phone that I
  never wanted and have not got,” he says. “I can’t work out how this has
  happened or whether someone from O2 is in on it.” In fact, Stanwyck had fallen
  victim to a crime that began with a phishing call from a fraudster
  masquerading as an O2 sales agent. Criminal gangs call batches of phone
  numbers stolen from data hacks or bought on the dark web and offer tempting
  discounts on contracts or devices. They may not know who your mobile provider
  is – what they do know is that some of the people they call will be customers
  of the company they are posing as, and may be susceptible to the bogus deal. A
  clue to the scam was the quality of the line, which Stanwyck says was
  crackling, and the poor English of the caller, which he says he struggled to
  understand. During the call, the fraudster tricked Stanwyck into disclosing
  the “one-time authorisation code” (Otac) – also known as one-time password –
  with which O2 verifies identity when a customer logs in. That allowed the
  fraudster to order an iPhone on Stanwyck’s O2 account. The second part of the
  fraud was the fake courier who arrived to intercept the package before the
  genuine returns bag arrived. If Stanwyck had not already arranged to return
  the phone, the “courier” would have tried other means to dupe him into handing
  it over. Other victims have been told their parcel was sent in error. O2
  confirmed Stanwyck had been a victim of fraud after Guardian Money intervened.
  It wiped the debt, cancelled the credit agreement the criminals had signed him
  up to and closed its fraud case. “We always aim to take swift action whenever
  fraud is reported to us, and we apologise that in this case it took longer
  than it should have done,” says a spokesperson. “We urge customers to be
  vigilant if they receive a call out of the blue from someone claiming to be
  from O2, and remember that if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably
  is.” On its website, O2 has published a detailed warning to customers about
  these scams. Marina Gibbs, the policy director for networks and communications
  at the telecoms regulator Ofcom, says: “Customers endure a barrage of scam
  calls, and when people get caught out, the consequences can be devastating.
  The work we’ve collectively already done has led to 1m calls a day being
  blocked, but we’re always looking for new ways to shore up our defences in the
  fight against fraud.” * Name has been changed How to avoid being scammed •
  Always beware cold calls offering eye-catching deals, especially if you are
  being pressed into signing up immediately. • Companies will never under any
  circumstances ask for an Otac. If you are asked for one, hang up. • Companies
  will never ask you to disregard security warnings from your bank or any other
  service provider. • Beware calls and texts that begin with an impersonal
  greeting, ask for your bank details or passwords, prompt you to click a link
  or demand immediate payment. • Mobile phone providers will always provide a
  prepaid envelope for device returns, and it will always be to the address of
  their returns centres. • If you are suspicious of a caller, end the call and
  ring your phone company. Wait a few minutes so that the line to the scammer is
  not still open when you dial. • Report a suspicious call or message that
  purports to be from your phone company to your service provider.
