  The crosses of St George are flying all around me. Fair to say the opening
  line of Three Lions ’98 hits a little differently in 2025. The crosses of St
  George are being daubed on an Islamic centre in Basildon. The crosses of St
  George are being used to deface a Chinese takeaway in York. The crosses of St
  George are draped over men shouting at a three-star hotel from a
  mini-roundabout. The crosses of St George are retailing for about £2.36 on
  Temu, depending on whether you want them car-window sized, or big enough to
  write the words “GET OFF MY LAND” in the white spaces. Keir Starmer has
  declared that he is “a supporter of flags”. Alas, at the time of writing the
  prime minister’s position on other items of tactile fabric remains unclear.
  What does he think about blankets? Does he endorse or condemn the dishcloth?
  Not to be outdone, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, disclosed that she has
  St George’s bunting on display at home. “I would put them up anywhere,” she
  confirmed, which – anatomically speaking – is not an image any of us needed
  right now. Naturally it barely requires saying at this point that the recent
  wave of flag onanism is a thinly disguised trap laid by the resurgent
  far-right, a way of sneaking its toxic politics into our shared public spaces
  under the guise of broad-church patriotism. It’s just a flag. How can you get
  triggered by a flag? How can any right-thinking citizen possibly object to
  this most simple expression of collective pride? Albeit an expression largely
  being expressed by a few lone individuals in the dead of night, which is when
  all great expressions of collective pride traditionally occur. Into this
  stinking cheese dream of contested symbolisms, amateur semiotics and flag
  enemas step Thomas Tuchel’s England: refreshed and rebooted after their summer
  slump, facing games against Andorra this Saturday and Serbia next Tuesday.
  There are, of course, more banal sporting issues under scrutiny here. Can
  Elliot Anderson stake a claim in midfield? Can Tuchel find a less soporific
  way of breaking down a low block? And yet, at the same time, this is simply a
  very interesting moment for an England team to be taking the field under the
  England flag, with all its attached mythologies and meanings. Football has
  always been a reluctant participant in these conversations, and in particular
  English football, with its proud anti‑intellectual streak and reverence of the
  bottom line. After all, there are vibes to be maintained, disposable barbecues
  to be sold, pub gardens to be filled, Club Wembley corporate packages to be
  shifted. Far better to retreat into the usual bromides: no greater honour,
  play for the shirt, honestly thought it was a wind-up when I saw the number on
  my phone, and so on. Tuchel, for his part, has made no secret of the extent to
  which questions of identity and symbolism and nationalism concern him, which
  is to say not in the slightest. On his unveiling he affirmed that he was a
  “head coach, not a manager”, signalled his distaste for “sport-politics”, even
  admitting that he could use his foreignness as a kind of impregnability cloak
  on such matters. And, you know, fair enough. Seen through Tuchel’s eyes,
  football – even international football – probably does feel like an entirely
  neutral space, a hermetically sealed world where the borders are fluid and the
  dressing rooms are polyglot, where everyone is rich and talented, where all
  the football pitches are the same and all the football pitches are good. But
  at the same time it is important to be clear what Tuchel is really saying
  here. What he is saying is that his England team will stand for nothing
  outside itself. It will play football, and you will watch, and it will try to
  win, and you will be happy or sad, and these alone are the ceiling and four
  walls of its ambition. Whatever you think of that as an ambition it is also a
  desperately tricky line to maintain, and not simply because, in football,
  politics has a habit of finding a path through even the most impermeable
  cracks. For if Barthes – Roland, not Fabien – teaches us anything, it is that
  the very act of trying to mean nothing is in itself a form of meaning. Perhaps
  this is doubly true in a pursuit as mass-cultural as football, a sport utterly
  in thrall to its mythologies, its symbols, a phenomenon being constantly
  shattered and re‑shattered in the sheer heat of its collective gaze. However
  thoroughly you try to strip it of meaning – the pointless friendly, the
  infinite content scroll, games slopped upon games – meaning finds a way. I did
  promise you amateur semiotics. Images rely on captions for their meaning. Who
  gets to caption an England flag? The fan painting it on her cheek? The players
  walking out underneath it? The neo-Nazi plastering it on a zebra crossing at
  3am? Certainly not the tortured and grimacing Starmer, a man who has
  outsourced his dinner to a focus group and is now being forced to eat the
  results, mumbling “I get it, I really do” as he chews unhappily on his meal of
  roast chicken, custard and Haribo bhuna. However reticent they may be to admit
  it, the England team that take the field on Saturday are not simply athletes
  with a goal but bearers of an idea. The flag under which they play is
  freighted with connotations and mythologies they did not author and in which
  they probably have no interest. Perhaps this has always been England’s
  original sin: the absence of that idea, empty and unfocused fervour as a
  substitute for thought. But the more we recoil from defining these symbols,
  the more vulnerable we are to having them defined for us. As the Lionesses
  demonstrated so stirringly over the summer, Englishness as a trait need not be
  expressed in photographic negative. Like the Palestinian or Ukrainian or Pride
  flag, the England flag can be a reclamation of agency, a reassertion of our
  unity, diversity and shared values, a champion of the vulnerable, a rejection
  rather than an embrace of intolerance. And yes: it is tiring to have to keep
  having these arguments. It should feel depressing to have to restate the basic
  principles of our humanity, to debate those with no intention of listening, to
  be reminded over and over that international football is political by its very
  nature. To an extent this is simply a measure of the moment in which we find
  ourselves: a society stripped to a husk, hollowed and directionless, reduced
  to howling at symbols. But when the symbols are all that remain, they matter a
  great deal.
