  Queensland parliament has passed controversial legislation permitting police
  to issue on-the-spot domestic violence orders despite warnings from experts
  and advocacy group that the laws could be weaponised against victim-survivors.
  Liberal National party members of state parliament voted to pass legislation
  granting police the power to issue “police protection directives”, with
  conditions similar to other domestic violence protection orders. The new laws
  will take effect in January and do not require a judge’s oversight. Police are
  also not required to get the consent of a suspected victim before issuing an
  order. It passed over the opposition of every opposition and crossbench MP at
  its second reading debate, and much of the domestic violence sector. The
  Queensland police minister, Dan Purdie, said they would save “hundreds of
  thousands of hours” of police time”. But the Queensland council of social
  service argued that the approach prioritises “police efficiencies over the
  safety and wellbeing of victim-survivors,” it said. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email About 70 submissions to a parliamentary inquiry – including from experts
  and advocacy groups – called for the government to rethink the plan. Most
  raised concerns about misidentification – where police identify the victim of
  domestic violence as the perpetrator. According to evidence cited by the
  Queensland Council of Social Service, about 44.4% of women murdered in
  domestic violence incidents reviewed by the Queensland Domestic and Family
  Violence Death Review and Advisory Board had been misidentified at least once.
  “Nearly all” Indigenous women investigated had been identified as a
  perpetrator by police before they were murdered, it found. Queensland’s Mental
  Health Commission cited evidence from Women’s Legal Services New South Wales
  that more than half of women listed as respondents to apprehended domestic
  violence orders were in fact the primary victim of abuse. The Queensland
  Police Union of Employees general president, Shane Prior, strongly defended
  the legislation at its parliamentary inquiry. He said the rates of women
  identified as perpetrators had declined from 22% to 23% in 2022 to just 12%,
  and described the evidence about misidentification as “anecdotal”. About 97%
  of police domestic violence applications were upheld in court, he said. “We
  know that police can be trusted to get it right because the courts
  overwhelmingly back their decisions,” Prior told the inquiry. He pointed to a
  string of inquiries, including the commission of inquiry into the Queensland
  police service responses to domestic violence, for greatly improving “our
  understanding of the scale of the problem and deficiencies in system
  responses”. Police had improved training as a result, he said. The 2022
  inquiry into the Queensland police heard evidence that officers disbelieved
  female victims and actively avoided attending calls. Many of its
  recommendations have yet to be implemented. The new police protection orders
  were not recommended. The government also passed a series of unrelated
  amendments to the bill on Thursday that were introduced at the last minute.
  The amendments gave the attorney general the power to fire the director of
  Forensic Sciences Queensland (FSQ) – the state government’s independent DNA
  lab – and also to give them directions. It also exempts the state government
  from lawsuits after a recent damning report into FSQ.
