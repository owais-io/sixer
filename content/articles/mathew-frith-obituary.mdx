  My friend Mathew Frith, an urban nature conservationist, who has died aged 64
  from a glioblastoma (brain tumour), was best known for his work in London, but
  leaves a national legacy of championing urban nature, pioneering citizen
  science, saving wildlife sites from development, and improving public access
  to green space. In 1989 he joined the staff of the London Wildlife Trust, a
  charity founded on a vision for a greener, more inclusive city. As warden of
  Sydenham Hill Wood from 1990 to 1995, Mathew managed volunteers and learned
  how an urban woodland “works”. In 2000 he became urban adviser at English
  Nature, then joined the government’s influential Urban Green Spaces Taskforce,
  and revised the national standards for equal access to green spaces. In 2002,
  he joined the Peabody Trust, where he co-founded Neighbourhoods Green, a
  landmark £15.6m programme to improve life for its residents across 70 housing
  estates. Drawn back to LWT in 2009, he served successively as director of
  policy and research, deputy chief executive and director of conservation. He
  lectured at UCL Birkbeck, and advised the Commission for Architecture and the
  Built Environment, the Green Flag scheme, and the mayor of London’s Rewilding
  Taskforce. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society, a member of the Chartered
  Institute of Ecology &amp; Environmental Management, and a member of the
  Society for the Environment. Mathew was appointed MBE in 2023 for services to
  the natural environment. He was born in Purley, Surrey, to Margaret (nee
  Searle) and Edward, an insurance underwriter, and grew up in south Croydon
  with his siblings, Toby and Penny. He went to Trinity school of John Whitgift
  in Croydon, having won a scholarship at 11-plus. Early childhood involved
  watching butterflies emerge from pupae hanging from the lid of the family
  television – and exploring the “cool, chalky, hazelnut-covered” Croham Hurst
  Woods. Mathew studied zoology at the University of Exeter (1979-82), but was
  disenchanted with what he considered its “reductionist” approach, and instead
  turned to music. While touring as a guitarist with the rock band Loop in
  1988-89, he was known for disappearing in search of dragonflies. A
  self-confessed “failed rock star”, he then found his way back to nature with a
  job at the Greater London council’s ecology unit. He believed nature
  conservation was “a political act”. He railed against the “deserts” of
  London’s green belt, and fought to protect wildlife-rich sites such as
  Hutchinson’s Bank in Croydon. Other places that benefited from his campaigns
  included Woodberry Wetlands in Hackney – opened by David Attenborough in 2016
  – and his beloved Croham Hurst. Mathew was as devoted to the ordinary as the
  rare – delighting in magpies, and discovering Impatiens frithii, a plant
  endemic to highland Cameroon. His idiosyncratic style – white clothes, bangles
  and rings, changing hairstyles and calligraphic postcards – was matched by his
  wit, kindness and energy. Lately, he had been honing his uniquely florid prose
  via an MA in nature and travel writing at the University of Bath. Mathew met
  Keren Protheroe at a Christmas craft fair, and they married in 2011. She
  survives him, along with Penny and Toby.
