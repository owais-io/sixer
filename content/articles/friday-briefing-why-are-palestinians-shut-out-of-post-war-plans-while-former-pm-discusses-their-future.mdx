  Good morning. Tony Blair is back and he has plans for the Middle East. No, you
  have not woken up and jumped back two decades in time. The former Labour
  leader, who was put under pressure to resign after the disastrous decision to
  go to war with Iraq – which led to the death of a million Iraqis and created a
  vacuum later filled by the brutal Islamic State – is back in the headlines
  this week. Blair has attended a White House meeting with Donald Trump and his
  Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, according
  to recent reports. The former British prime minister has been working on a
  proposal for several months for the governance in Gaza after the war ends. The
  72-year-old has reportedly been doing so with Trump’s son-in-law Jared
  Kushner, the Israeli minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer, and the
  Emirati foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed. Who appears to be missing from
  this roundtable on who will govern Palestinians in Gaza? The Palestinians
  themselves. While reporting suggests Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas was
  briefed, there is little indication that Palestinians have any real say. But
  Palestinians are not voiceless as our current leaders often imply. Nor must
  they remain at the mercy of those more powerful. They also have their own plan
  for a postwar Gaza. To understand what leaders of Palestinian civil society
  are calling for, and what drives their continuing struggle for
  self-determination, I spoke to Ubai Al-Aboudi, director of the Bisan Center
  for Research and Development and member of the steering committee of the
  Palestinian NGO Network. He is based in Ramallah. That’s after the headlines.
  Five big stories Ukraine | The UK and European Union have summoned their
  Russian envoys after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people and
  damaged British Council and EU offices. UK news | The Treasury is reportedly
  considering a tax on landlords in the autumn budget that would target income
  from rents. The proposals are centred on the expansion of national insurance
  to include rental income. Iran | The UK, France and Germany have formally
  notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN
  sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to
  its nuclear sites. US news | The White House named non-scientist Jim O’Neill,
  a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr, to serve as acting head of the US Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), amid a standoff over the firing of
  director Susan Monarez whose lawyers said she could only be removed by Donald
  Trump himself. Environment | The collapse of a critical Atlantic current can
  no longer be considered a low-likelihood event, a study has concluded, making
  deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions even more urgent to avoid the catastrophic
  impact. In depth: ‘Palestinian narrative is being erased’ After stepping down
  as UK prime minister in 2007, Tony Blair served as the UN Middle East envoy
  until 2015. He spent years visiting Jerusalem pushing for a peace agreement
  between the Israelis and Palestinians, but there was no resolution, nor any
  meaningful development towards a Palestinian state. Details of the plans being
  discussed by Blair, the US and Israeli officials remain scarce for now. The
  far right in Israel remains animated by a proposal announced in February,
  weeks after Donald Trump was elected, in which the US president effectively
  called for Gaza to be ethnically cleansed, the land seized by the US, and an
  international resort built. The “Gaza Riviera” plan was widely condemned,
  including by western-backed Arab allies. Trump has been a lot quieter on this
  plan since. In July, reports emerged that Blair’s thinktank worked with a
  project developing a postwar Gaza plan that included the creation of a “Trump
  Riviera” and a manufacturing zone named after Elon Musk. The project was led
  by Israeli business people using financial models developed by the US firm
  Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change
  (TBI) said it was not involved in the authorship of the plan but two staff
  members took part in calls as the project evolved. BCG has distanced itself
  significantly from the work in Gaza, reportedly firing two partners who it
  said had misled senior management. “There is not a single Palestinian at the
  table” in these reported discussions, Ubai Al-Aboudi told me, “whether it’s
  the Palestinian political leadership or representatives of Palestinian civil
  society and the wider Palestinian communities.” He added: “This is colonial
  practice. Palestinians must decide their own governance and future. But
  instead, while we are being genocided, the same powers complicit in the
  genocide are planning our future.” *** What Palestinians want Al-Aboudi
  dismissed Blair not only as a war criminal who must answer for the horrors
  that unfolded in Iraq, but for his role as the Middle Eastern envoy, “which
  failed in reining in Israel’s policies of fragmentation, of, increased
  settlement activity, increased human rights violations against Palestinians,
  increased economic dependency of Palestinians”. From the early days of the war
  in Gaza, Palestinian civil society has emphasised that any governance or
  rebuilding must have Palestinian agency at its core, Al-Aboudi explained,
  which factors in Palestinian cultural, historical, and socioeconomic heritage.
  “It should take into account that 80% of the people living in Gaza, for
  example, are refugees whose fathers and grandfathers were ethnically cleansed
  from their villages back in 1948. It should take into account that there
  should be unity between the West Bank and Gaza, and it should take into
  account that the Israeli system of control over Palestinians cannot continue
  and should not be allowed or maintained. No Israeli should have a say or a
  call on the future of any Palestinian; this should be the number one lesson
  from this genocide,” Al-Aboudi said. “What’s happening right now is totally
  different. Palestinian voices are being totally ignored. The Palestinian
  narrative is being erased.” He said Palestinian civil society embraced the
  Egypt plan for Gaza, which was backed by the Arab league and Europe, which
  would rebuild Gaza and support Palestinian technocrats, operating under the
  management of the Palestinian Authority (PA), to take over Gaza’s governance.
  The plan, which includes elections, would eventually lead to Gaza and the West
  Bank coming together as part of a Palestinian state. “We have called for … a
  democratically elected leadership that would guide our people towards freedom
  … that would lift up our people. Unfortunately, all of these calls have fallen
  on deaf ears, whether from the international community or the US,” Al-Aboudi
  said. *** The denial of Palestinian autonomy Life for Palestinians in the West
  Bank means being trapped between a rock and a hard place: the Israeli
  occupation on one side and a Palestinian Authority that works with it on the
  other. Al-Aboudi’s organisation, Bisan, works to secure socioeconomic rights
  for Palestinians and to advocate on their behalf “not just against Israeli
  occupation but also the Palestinian Authority and big business when they
  violate people’s rights”. “Our work has put us in the crosshairs of everyone.
  I’ve been arrested by both Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian
  Authority. Our organisation has been targeted, but we’re still operational,
  pushing for the basic right of Palestinians to live in dignity.” But even the
  western-backed PA, widely criticised by many Palestinians for its role in
  working closely with the Israeli occupation, has been excluded from
  discussions about Gaza’s future. That’s largely down to the Israeli prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other Israeli ministers who have firmly
  ruled out any role for the PA in Gaza. “What we have now is a propped-up
  dictator, Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected in 2005 for a four-year period that
  has now stretched for more than 20 years. He has been kept in power by outside
  support, not popular support. And now, even this propped-up leadership is not
  being consulted on what kind of leadership or governance should exist; let
  alone … the Palestinian community itself, the people who are going through the
  genocide right now,” Al-Aboudi said. *** The work continues For Al-Aboudi, the
  denial of Palestinian agency has been a process that has unfolded over many
  decades. In 2021, Israel designated Bisan Centre and five other human rights
  organisations in the occupied territories as terrorists. This was widely
  rebuffed by the international community. “Israel has always worked to stifle
  any kind of Palestinian agency … We have always been subjected to Israeli
  harassment.” But he explained that the sucker punch was landed when the
  Israeli government designated Bisan under the same label as al-Qaida and
  Islamic State. “Can you imagine that? Civil society organisations that write
  reports, provide aid for people, provide legal counselling, communicate to the
  world, to the UN, what is happening here, are being treated in the same way as
  IS?” Al-Aboudi said. Yet the work continues. “We believe in every human being
  in the world. We believe in equality, we believe in dignity, and we believe
  our people deserve it like any other people around the world.” With the
  Palestinians living amid one of their darkest chapters in their history, I
  asked Al-Aboudi why he still holds on to hope. “This is the only thing that
  keeps us going … When we see millions of people on the streets of London or
  Manchester, or in Sydney, Australia … this gives us hope. We know that
  righteousness is on our side. We know that the people of the world feel for
  what we are going through,” he said. And, he added, that regardless of what is
  being planned in backrooms, he ultimately believes that political agency will,
  at the end of the day, lie with the people. “The people have the power, and
  the people can claim back their political agency from corrupt governments and
  businesses.” What else we’ve been reading Patrick Greenfield has a fascinating
  look at the genuinely serious work of tackling invasive hornets threatening UK
  pollinators. Phoebe I may be slightly (OK, very) biased, but I highly
  recommend my reported memoir Scattered, out in paperback now. It’s about the
  Somali civil war and how I went from being a child refugee to a Guardian
  journalist. Aamna Nice analysis from Jessica Elgot on how the light summer
  news agenda has left the perfect gap for a barrage of attention-seeking
  announcements from Farage, who is very much not on annual leave. Phoebe The
  number of families home-educating their children has more than doubled over
  the past five years. This interview with parents paints a worrying picture of
  the state of education today. Aamna Love this one-in-a-million photo of tennis
  player Jasmine Paolini at the US open, and it sounds as if she loved it too.
  Phoebe Sport Football | Crystal Palace sealed a place in the Uefa Conference
  League as a goalless draw at Fredrikstad was enough for a 1-0 win on
  aggregate. Cycling | Chris Froome was airlifted to hospital and due to have
  surgery after suffering a collapsed lung and breaking his back and five ribs
  during a serious crash while training in France. Football | A man has been
  arrested in Lancashire after racist and abusive messages were sent online to
  the England defender Jess Carter during the women’s Euros in July. The front
  pages “Russian envoys summoned as UK and EU offices hit in Kyiv” – that’s the
  lead story in the Guardian print edition. “Rayner dodges £40,000 stamp duty”
  says the Telegraph. The Financial Times has “City fears mount over Reeves’ tax
  raid on banks to help fill £20bn fiscal hole” while the Mail runs with “Now
  Asda boss tells Reeves: stop taxing everything”. “French police ‘won’t go in
  sea’ to stop boats” proclaims the Express. “Harry ‘to meet Charles’” – the
  Mirror tags that as an exclusive. “All babies to be offered chickenpox
  vaccination” announces the Times. More details in the i paper: “Free
  chickenpox vaccination on NHS for 500,000 a year for first time”. Still on
  that, “They think itch all over” – terrible, Metro, just terrible. Something
  for the weekend Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play
  and listen to right now TV Disaster at Sea: The Piper Alpha Story | ★★★★☆ On
  the evening of 6 July 1988, the Piper Alpha oil production platform in the
  North Sea suffered a catastrophic gas explosion in which 167 people were
  killed. After the disaster, a public inquiry struggled to form a complete
  picture of the event. This documentary series on iPlayer, copes with the
  challenge superbly, leaning heavily on survivor testimony – 61 men escaped
  from the rig – and combining it with a simple 2D diagram of the platform’s
  layout to give us the fullest picture possible. The shocking story is
  skilfully told by those unfussy dramatisations of the survivors’ words, as the
  actors leave us in no doubt about how deeply traumatised the men were by their
  experience. Jack Seale Music Blood Orange: Essex Honey | ★★★★★ This is an
  exquisitely eclectic portrait of grief. It combines gorgeous melodies with
  dancefloor rhythms, indie pop and languorous funk – and cameos from Lorde and
  Zadie Smith. Its primary mood is a very British kind of late
  summer-into-autumn melancholy: there’s a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the
  sounds. The melodies are frequently gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by
  the death of Hynes’s mother, the lyrics evoke both Greater London’s urban
  sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I hold dear,” he sings on The Last of
  England – and its more pastoral surroundings, the latter a relief from “the
  broken light” of the city on countryside. Alexis Petridis Film In the Nguyen
  Kitchen | ★★★★☆ In this heartwarming feature debut, Stéphane Ly-Cuong turns to
  the magic of the musical comedy to portray not only the dreams and the
  struggles of Vietnamese-French artists, but also a side of Paris seldom seen
  on screen. A hopeful performer and singer, Yvonne Nguyen (Clotilde Chevalier)
  can’t help but dream in songs. Without much luck getting cast in acting roles,
  Yvonne moves back in with her mother (Anh Tran-Nghia), who runs a restaurant
  in the outskirts of Paris. This push-and-pull lays bare the barriers faced in
  an industry where Asian characters are often seen as interchangeable. Phuong
  Le Theatre Juniper Blood (Donmar Warehouse, London) | ★★★☆☆ Mike Bartlett’s
  invigorating play is a drama about whether it is possible to live responsibly
  in our age of toxic capitalism. It begins as a blended-family satire with
  eco-arguments and generational clash bolted on. But with each act the ground
  on its earthy set turns, developing into what might be a state-of-the-nation
  play. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is localism just
  a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new pastoral idyll?
  Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling and
  ambitious. Bartlett masterfully weds levity through social satire with
  complexity and depth of subject matter. Arifa Akbar Today in Focus Missing in
  the Amazon: the fightback – episode five Revisited: Funerals are held for Dom
  Phillips and Bruno Pereira and there is hope that the election of President
  Lula will mean new protections for the Amazon – and that the killers of Dom
  and Bruno will face justice. But organised crime is widespread and
  deep-rooted. The investigative journalist Sônia Bridi tells the Guardian’s
  Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, about a man who allegedly not only
  may have helped plan the killings but may have ordered them. A man whose name
  strikes fear across the region Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A
  bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Two 13-year-olds
  have been leading an audacious project to save harvest mice – Britain’s
  smallest rodent. Best friends Eva Wishart and Emily Smith embarked on a
  project to restore the animals in Devon after finding out that the species is
  threatened due to farming practices and habitat loss. In the two years since,
  they have bred dozens of the tiny rodents in their garages. On Wednesday they
  released 250 of them into a local nature reserve. The pair managed to finance
  with £4,000 crowdfunded from the public. If the mice successfully breed, the
  girls plan to release more harvest mice, as well as common lizards. “I would
  like more people in my generation to have the chance to do things like this,”
  Wishart said. Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you
