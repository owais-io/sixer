  Record transfers and a managerial merry-go-round – but can anyone stop Chelsea
  in the WSL?

  After a breathless summer that included heart-stopping penalty shootouts, a
  swathe of managerial changes and even the women’s game’s first £1m transfer
  fee, as the new Women’s Super League season arrives, the million-dollar
  question is, can anyone stop Chelsea? The defending champions have won six WSL
  titles in a row and they notched up a record points tally last term to win the
  title by their largest margin yet – 12. Ominously for their rivals, they were
  trying to strengthen their squad even further during the final hours of the
  transfer window with the signing of the United States winger Alyssa Thompson
  from Angel City. Chelsea are, undeniably, the dominant force in the modern
  English women’s game and only appear to be getting stronger. Sonia Bompastor’s
  side, who also won the FA Cup and League Cup to clinch a domestic treble in
  her first season in England, will begin their campaign at home to Manchester
  City on Friday, a fixture with a blockbuster feel at Stamford Bridge. A third
  of the teams in the top flight have changed managers and the visitors’ new
  head coach, the Swede Andrée Jeglertz, is hoping to transform the fortunes of
  a team that have not won the league since 2016. As the former Denmark national
  team coach held his first pre-match press conference at Manchester City on
  Wednesday afternoon, Jeglertz was asked if Chelsea could be stopped and
  whether his new team could be the team to stop them, and he replied: “I
  wouldn’t sit in this chair if I thought something else. “That’s definitely
  something the club really wants us to do and the belief in us is big. But we
  will also need to grow into the season, so we also said to the players, ‘not
  everything will be perfect on Friday.’ We will definitely be ready for the
  game but we also need to have a little bit of patience.” Another of the title
  hopefuls, Arsenal, who finished second last term, enter the campaign riding a
  wave of optimism after winning the Champions League in May. The north
  Londoners made history by breaking the £1m transfer-fee barrier to sign the
  Canada forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool this summer, signalling their
  intent as they bid for a first league title since 2019. Manchester United, who
  finished third last term, are the only side other than Arsenal, Chelsea and
  Manchester City to have lifted a major domestic trophy in the past 11 years
  (the FA Cup in 2024) and it would be hard to look past one of that quartet
  claiming the main prize this term. The club doing the most to upset the apple
  cart is the newly promoted side London City Lionesses, the first fully
  independent women’s club to reach the WSL. Their owner, Michele Kang, has
  previously stated her ambition to win the league in the future, rather than
  merely stay up, and their transfer business reflects that target to be
  competitive. They have brought in star international names including the
  Netherlands midfielder Daniëlle van de Donk, the Italy centre-back Elena
  Linari and the England forward Nikita Parris. It has been a summer recruitment
  drive unlike anything witnessed before from a side that won promotion, and
  they are still not finished, with ever-strengthening reports linking the
  Bromley-based club with the France midfielder Grace Geyoro. It may still be a
  stretch to expect them to break into the European places just yet but, at the
  same time, no one is expecting them to go straight back down, which in turn
  could generate anxiety for the clubs who were in the bottom section of the
  table last term. Finishing second from bottom last time around were Tottenham,
  but they are one of four top-tier sides to be starting the season with a
  different manager, after hiring the former Brann coach Martin Ho to replace
  Robert Vilahamn, and hoping for a fresh new start. Finishing level on points
  with Tottenham, and one place higher in 10th, were Leicester, and they sacked
  their manager, Amandine Miquel, only 11 days before their opening game of the
  season. They are understood to have brought in the former West Ham assistant
  coach Rick Passmoor as an interim coach. The top flight’s other managerial
  change has been the appointment by Liverpool of Gareth Taylor, who was
  replaced by Jeglertz at Manchester City. Taylor’s tenure gets under way on
  Sunday with just the small task of a Merseyside derby at Anfield; no pressure.
  Everton have enjoyed their best summer in recent memory and on Wednesday they
  broke their club-record transfer fee to sign Ruby Mace from Leicester.
  Brighton and Aston Villa – who finished fifth and sixth last term – will also
  go into this campaign hopeful, after strong seasons, and West Ham also have
  some momentum after a decent second half of 2024-25. The chances of any of
  these sides being relegated this season have been greatly reduced by the new,
  one-off format for promotion and relegation; the WSL is expanding from 12 to
  14 next summer, so at the end of this season there will be a playoff between
  the bottom side and the team that finish third in WSL2, rather than an
  automatic relegation spot. There will also be major changes to broadcasting
  coverage this season; every game is being screened live and the majority
  kicking off in a new slot, with multiple games simultaneously at midday on
  Sundays every week, as well as more frequent Friday night games. Sky Sports
  has 118 live matches, with the rest on the BBC, and the sport is seeking to
  capitalise on England’s summer success. Both television audiences and
  match-going attendances decreased last term but there is optimism that the
  Lionesses’ inspiration, coupled with moves to larger stadiums such as Arsenal
  making the Emirates their home for every league game and Everton moving into
  Goodison Park, can help reverse that blip. If the summer’s drama is anything
  to go by, do not expect this season to be dull. Talking points Record amount
  spent: The latest mid-year transfer snapshot report from the governing body
  Fifa has revealed that, so far this summer, global spending on women’s
  football transfer fees has surpassed US$12m (£8.9m), which is an increase of
  more than 80% from the summer of 2024, moving past $10m for the first time.
  There have been a record 1,100 international transfers in this window and
  climbing. The average fee exchanged is just over $80,000, but only 13% of
  transfers involve a fee. Hera we go: Last December, this newsletter told the
  story of Hera United, a new, independent women’s club hoping to change the
  footballing rules in the Netherlands by gaining permission to run a
  professional women’s side, which was previously not allowed without an
  affiliation to an established men’s club. On Wednesday it was officially
  confirmed that the KNVB’s independent licensing committee has ruled in favour
  of the club and therefore granted them a women’s football licence, meaning
  they will take over Telstar’s licence in the Eredivisie Vrouwen immediately
  before the new season starting this weekend, when they are away to AZ Alkmaar.
  A new feel for a new season: Sky Sports, which shares the rights for domestic
  WSL television coverage with the BBC but which will show the vast majority of
  the live games, has announced its coverage will have a new format on Sundays,
  with an hour’s buildup from 11am followed by an around-the-grounds feel for
  the multiple kick-offs at midday. The broadcaster has also said that Ellen
  Ellard is its new “lead commentator” for the WSL while the former Scotland
  captain Rachel Corsie has joined as an analyst. Caroline Barker will continue
  to present its coverage, from a new studio. Recommended listening After what
  seemed like the shortest off-season ever, the WSL and WSL 2 are back. Faye
  Carruthers, Suzy Wrack and the panel preview what to expect in 2025-26. Listen
  here. Recommended viewing The WSL’s new-season launch video features
  everything from Ian Wright to great goals to Ed Sheeran in an Ipswich dressing
  room.  Recommended booking On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry
  Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and
  Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered football punditry at Troxy in
  London. The pod will also be livestreamed globally. Book now.  Quote of the
  day “It is a great feeling to join Everton. It is unreal that this [Goodison
  Park] is going to be the home of Everton Women. I am so excited to get
  started. I feel so at home here, the girls are lovely. Everyone is just
  backing everyone and I just can’t wait to get started on the pitch.” The
  England midfielder Ruby Mace speaking to Everton’s website about her
  club-record transfer from Leicester. Still want more? It is the transfer
  deadline in England and Germany on Thursday while those in Italy (10
  September), Spain and France (both 19 September) carry on for a bit longer.
