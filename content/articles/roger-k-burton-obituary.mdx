  Roger K Burton, who has died aged 76 from acute myeloid leukaemia, turned a
  derelict former stables for ailing cab horses into London’s most independent
  and outré arts space. “The building had been unused for about 10 years when my
  friend Guy Adams found it in 1992. There were pigeons flying about, rats and
  mice everywhere and ivy growing through the collapsed roof – not to mention a
  thick layer of printing ink covering up the fabulous floor,” he said. “It took
  a good six months to make the place habitable, but it was more than worth it.
  I still adore seeing the surprised faces of first-time visitors.” Since
  opening in 1993, the Horse Hospital, in a mews in Bloomsbury, has hung art by
  Joe Coleman, Ron Athey, Jamie Reid and Banksy; held transgressive film,
  literature and fashion festivals; run salons on all manner of unpopular
  culture; and hosted disparate performers such as Gavin Bryars, Lydia Lunch,
  Anita Pallenberg, Coil and Crass. The Turner prize-winning Tai Shani cut her
  teeth programming events under the wing of the unswervingly enthusiastic and
  generous Burton, whose magnetic presence drew in serious, but often
  marginalised, talent from around the globe. The Georgian building also houses
  the Contemporary Wardrobe Collection, the nation’s largest repository of
  postwar youth culture fashion, which Burton collected; it was sumptuously
  photographed in his 2017 book Rebel Threads: Clothing of the Bad, Beautiful
  &amp; Misunderstood, the last word on subversive style. A teenage mod, the
  farmer’s son was led from rural Leicestershire to London by an obsessive
  pursuit of sharp dressing at the end of the 1970s. He created the distinctive
  appearance of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood’s shops Worlds End in
  Chelsea and Nostalgia of Mud in St Christopher’s Place; he styled countless
  pop videos and films, including Julien Temple’s Absolute Beginners (1986),
  Iain Softley’s Hackers (1995) and Michael Haussman’s Blind Horizon (2003); and
  curated landmark exhibitions. He also served for many years on the jury board
  at Bafta. The Horse Hospital’s inaugural Vive le Punk! (1993) was the first to
  gather together artefacts from all of McLaren and Westwood’s shops. There was
  a 20-year anniversary show of the same name that included documentary films of
  British youth culture. Born in Burton Overy, Leicestershire, where his parents
  Joyce (nee Kinsley) and Kenneth Burton worked a tenant farm, Roger went to
  Gartree high school, Oadby. “I never had the opportunity nor desire to go to
  university. Hating authority, I left school as quickly as possible,” he said.
  “I became a jack-of-all-trades and wheeler-dealer, and have somehow managed to
  survive by ducking and diving while gaining loads of knowledge. I guess I
  turned into the perennial student.” His passion for fashion led to the opening
  of his first shop, Pioneer Antiques (later Hollywood Fashions) in Leicester.
  By 1976 he was making a living from vintage clothing and was searching for
  “dead stock” – pristine clothing unsold at the time of its manufacture. In
  1977, he opened the shop PX in Covent Garden, central London, with three
  friends from Leicester: Ric Carter, Steph Raynor and Helen Robinson. “We were
  offered this old warehouse by Andrew Czezowski, of Roxy club fame. I had a
  clear idea of what I wanted it to look like, and just happened to be passing a
  building in Mayfair that was being cleared out. We paid £20 for all this
  industrial ducting and metal cages, which fit perfectly with the boiler-room
  submarine vibe I was after – all courtesy of MI5.” Though hailed by Michael
  Roberts in the Sunday Times as the future of retail, having made his mark with
  PX, Burton moved on. However, his shopfitting talents still remained in situ
  at Worlds End, with its backwards clock and rolling floorboards: “Everything,
  from my favourite Midlands pub, the Crooked House in Himley, to Alice in
  Wonderland, pirate ships and William Hogarth were drawn upon.” After supplying
  the wardrobe department of Franc Roddam’s film Quadrophenia (1979) with mod
  suits that he had been selling on Portobello Road, Burton’s styling nous came
  to the fore in the golden age of the pop promo. He loved to recount how he had
  put both the Specials’ Terry Hall (Ghost Town) and the Kinks’ Ray Davies (Come
  Dancing) in the same 1940s pinstripe suit, describing both as “true
  professionals”. He said the same of David Bowie and George Harrison. Life at
  the Horse Hospital was never easy. Bloomsbury began to be redeveloped in the
  early 2000s, and the building’s owners tried to oust him. Researching its
  history, Burton discovered it had been built by James Burton, the most
  successful property developer of Regency and Georgian London. It was Grade II
  listed and registered as a community asset. But it wasn’t until late 2024 that
  Roger attained sufficient funding to secure its future – at the same time as
  he received his diagnosis. Throughout his treatment, he worked on the
  exhibition The In-Crowd: Mod Fashion and Style 1958-1966 at Brighton Museum,
  and was present at its opening in May (it runs until 4 January). Burton summed
  up his philosophy as: “A fierce determination and ability to deal with
  constant threat of failure. But if you put out enough positive vibes, you will
  find like-minded people, and they will gravitate to you.” Roger is survived by
  Izabel Blackburn, whom he met in 1975 and married in 1983, their children
  Stevie, William and Simon, and grandchildren, Sam, Harrison, Nancy, Emmett,
  Joe and Ben. • Roger Kenneth Burton, fashion historian and collector, born 12
  June 1949; died 28 July 2025
