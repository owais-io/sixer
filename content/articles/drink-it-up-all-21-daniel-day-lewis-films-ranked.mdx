  21. Stars and Bars (1988) Perhaps keen not to be pigeonholed in high-fibre
  roles, Daniel Day-Lewis took on a pair of zany culture-clash comedies (the
  other was Eversmile, New Jersey) that featured him singing in a bubble bath.
  In Stars and Bars, he is a prim English art expert who travels to the American
  south to retrieve a Renoir from its owner (Harry Dean Stanton) and butts heads
  with various irksome oddballs. Playing the sort of nitwit that would become
  Hugh Grant’s meal-ticket, Day-Lewis proves that wackiness is not in his
  wheelhouse. 20. Nine (2009) The movie of the Broadway musical of Fellini’s 8½
  is one of only two duds on the Day-Lewis CV. Surrounded by dazzling female
  actors (Nicole Kidman, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Sophia Loren), he ends up
  making heavy weather of Guido, the bewildered auteur caught at a creative
  impasse. A light touch eludes him: he’s no Marcello Mastroianni, that’s for
  sure. 19. Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971) John Schlesinger’s bisexual
  love-triangle drama gave Day-Lewis his film debut at the age of 14. He is
  briefly shown sauntering along a row of parked cars, scratching the paintwork
  with a broken bottle. The delinquent behaviour, the insouciant look, the south
  London setting: this could be a teenage snapshot of Johnny from My Beautiful
  Laundrette. 18. Nanou (1986) Ten minutes or so of screen time doesn’t give
  Day-Lewis much chance to make an impression as the debonair ex of young Nanou
  (Imogen Stubbs). He finds her in France, where she has fallen in with a
  would-be terrorist, but says “au revoir” shortly after. Still, he looks
  Delon-level dashing in a raincoat. 17. Gandhi (1982) Like Sunday Bloody
  Sunday, another hooligan cameo for Day-Lewis. He gets dialogue this time, all
  of it racist, as he tries to intimidate the young Gandhi, played by Ben
  Kingsley. Movies in which Day-Lewis played a more prominent role have
  attracted no shortage of Oscar nominations, but Gandhi is the only one of his
  to have walked off with the best picture prize. 16. The Bounty (1984) Pauline
  Kael was one of Day-Lewis’s early champions but she argued that he “stuck out”
  and “seemed like a bad actor” in this version of Mutiny on the Bounty. In his
  big scene, he is furiously reprimanded by Anthony Hopkins as Captain Bligh.
  Equally noteworthy is the sight of Day-Lewis sharing the screen for the first
  time with one of his own acting heroes, Phil Davis. Also among the Bounty’s
  crew is the comic John Sessions: in Gangs of New York, Sessions would play an
  actor playing Abraham Lincoln, and getting harangued and pelted for his
  troubles by Day-Lewis. 15. Eversmile, New Jersey (1989) In his second stab at
  fish-out-of-water comedy, Day-Lewis is an over-zealous Irish travelling
  dentist given to philosophical musings (“Did we somehow mislay our genetic
  memory or did God just forget to give us better teeth?”) as he brings good
  brushing technique to Argentina courtesy of the DuBois Foundation for the
  Development of Dental Consciousness. Tending to priests, peasants and
  gangsters alike, he roams the land on his motorcycle and sidecar, gets chased
  by multiple Santa Clauses, falls for a woman on the run from her wedding, and
  finally declares: “The world is collapsing! And I have an erection!” 14. The
  Crucible (1996) Put Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder together on screen and it never
  works out well for their characters (see also: The Age of Innocence). In
  Arthur Miller’s by-the-book adaptation of his own ageless play about the Salem
  witch trials, Day-Lewis is the farmer John Proctor, who pays a heavy price for
  dallying with young Abigail (Ryder). It was through the making of the film,
  directed by Nicholas Hytner, that Day-Lewis first met Miller’s daughter,
  Rebecca, whom he married at the end of 1996, and with whom he had two of his
  three children, including Ronan, co-writer and director of Anemone. 13. The
  Boxer (1997) Training under Barry McGuigan, Day-Lewis boxed twice a day, seven
  days a week, for nearly three years to prepare to play the IRA soldier who
  embraces his pugilist roots after serving 14 years in prison. More
  inflammatory is his rekindled romance with his teenage sweetheart, who happens
  to be another prisoner’s wife, played by Emily Watson. In his third film for
  Jim Sheridan, Day-Lewis gives a hushed, coiled performance (he doesn’t lose
  his rag until the 85-minute mark). It heralded his first retirement – after
  this, he didn’t make another film for five years – but is not exactly what
  you’d call going out on a high. 12. A Room with a View (1985) Central to the
  rise of Day-Lewis was the timing of this Merchant-Ivory adaptation of EM
  Forster’s novel, which opened immediately after My Beautiful Laundrette. Hard
  to imagine a better illustration of his range than the back-to-back sight of
  the sensually swaggering Johnny in Laundrette and the uptight prig Cecil Vyse
  in Room. The moment when jilted Cecil stands with his shoe in his hand was all
  Day-Lewis’s idea. “If you take your shoes off in a situation in which you’re
  vulnerable,” he said, “you’ll feel 10 times more vulnerable.” Spoken like the
  shoemaker he would eventually become during his first retirement. 11. In the
  Name of the Father (1993) As Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four who were
  wrongly convicted and imprisoned for the 1974 IRA pub bombing, Day-Lewis goes
  from impish troublemaker to broken wreck and finally folk hero. Terrific to
  see him sharing the screen again with Phil Davis: this time, Davis is a brute
  putting the screws on him in the interrogation room. And the scene in which
  Gerry brutally castigates his father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), when the
  two of them are cooped up together in the same cell, remains blistering.
  Ultimately, this is a moral work rather than a cinematic one, and there is
  nothing much for Day-Lewis to play in the final hour but righteousness. 10.
  Phantom Thread (2017) Less a coherent movie than a string of eye-catching
  confrontations, Day-Lewis’s second collaboration with Paul Thomas Anderson –
  and the catalyst for his second retirement – casts him as Reynolds Woodcock, a
  fastidious and imperious 1950s dressmaker. Fun though the standoffs are,
  especially Reynolds’s hilariously disproportionate hissy fit after his
  asparagus is cooked in butter rather than oil and salt, the movie is little
  more than an arthouse Devil Wears Prada, with Day-Lewis in Meryl Streep mode
  and everyone else (bar Lesley Manville, superb as his indomitable sister)
  running scared. 9. Lincoln (2012) Day-Lewis won his third best actor Oscar for
  a mesmerising performance as the president trying to pass the 13th amendment,
  which outlawed slavery, as the civil war rages. Under Steven Spielberg’s
  direction, he brings a lolling looseness to lines that sound as if they’ve
  only just occurred to him. A simple scene depicting Lincoln meeting wounded
  soldiers in hospital is rendered moving by the actor’s unforced affability,
  his warming burr. His charisma makes you understand why the soldiers would get
  a kick simply from standing in his shadow. 8. The Ballad of Jack and Rose
  (2005) Nothing to do with Titanic, the Jack and Rose here are a father and
  daughter, played by Day-Lewis and Camilla Belle respectively, whose
  off-the-grid lifestyle is jeopardised when Jack’s girlfriend (Catherine
  Keener) comes to stay, bringing her teenage sons (Paul Dano and Ryan
  McDonald). Under the direction of his wife, the novelist and film-maker
  Rebecca Miller, Day-Lewis exudes grumpy charm as the Scottish immigrant whose
  love for his daughter grows gradually suffocating and even unsavoury. Two
  years before he and Day-Lewis locked horns spectacularly on screen in There
  Will Be Blood, Dano comes off badly in their fracas in a treehouse. It was
  Dano’s fine work here that prompted the senior actor to recommend him to Paul
  Thomas Anderson for that movie. 7. The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988)
  Philip Kaufman’s ambitious film of Milan Kundera’s novel about the Prague
  Spring contains a lead performance for which Day-Lewis has expressed regret.
  Though the script was in English, he learned Czech but still found himself out
  of his depth as the priapic brain surgeon Tomas: “It was something to do with
  language. The idea of speaking English with a Czech accent meant it wasn’t
  coming from anywhere.” Accept that touch of inauthenticity and it’s still
  possible to savour Day-Lewis’s wry, carnivorous sexual magnetism, and the
  pitiful sight of Tomas’s spirit being crushed by the political regime and the
  betrayals it demands. Other pluses: that mane of liquorice-coloured hair, and
  the actor’s tingling rapport with Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin. 6. Gangs of
  New York (2002) It was Leonardo DiCaprio who coaxed Day-Lewis out of his first
  retirement during a stroll in Central Park. The young star’s reward? To be
  comprehensively acted off the screen. As bullyboy William Cutting, aka Bill
  the Butcher, Day-Lewis isn’t merely the dominant presence in Martin Scorsese’s
  misshapen, mid-19th-century gangster thriller: he is its sole source of
  dynamism. In stove-pipe hat, flapping trenchcoat and with an American eagle
  printed on his glass eye, he looks like the Babadook’s sleazy uncle, giving
  off strong proto-Trumpian energy as he decries “the foreign hordes defiling”
  his land. There’s also a nice Day-Lewis Cinematic Universe crossover when he
  strides through a crowd of anti-Lincoln protesters and lobs a knife that hits
  a portrait of the president he would portray a decade later. He also gets to
  describe Ireland, his real-life off-screen love, as “an excrementous isle”. 5.
  The Last of the Mohicans (1992) The method actor as matinee idol. Even those
  who haven’t seen Michael Mann’s stylish, swoon-worthy take on the James
  Fenimore Cooper novel will know the lengths to which Day-Lewis went to portray
  Hawkeye, adoptive son of a Mohican chief. He lived wild for weeks, ate only
  what he could hunt or forage, learned to load a rifle while running through
  the forest and built his own canoe. The North Carolina landscapes are
  ravishing, though they risk being upstaged by the magnificence of the actor’s
  mighty brow and glossy tresses as he darts among the trees in slow-mo. Then
  there is that emphatic demand to Madeleine Stowe: “Stay alive, no matter what
  occurs! I will find you!” Who could possibly disobey? 4. My Beautiful
  Laundrette (1985) Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi saw the influence of Clint
  Eastwood on Day-Lewis’s minimalist performance as Johnny, the gay former thug
  who helps spruce up a London launderette. Director Stephen Frears thought he
  was more like Marlene Dietrich. The actor described it as “the first film that
  I ever passionately wanted to do”. Hence the letter he wrote to Frears (“I
  know you think I come from a public-school background but I’ve got very nasty
  friends”) in which he threatened to break the director’s legs if he didn’t
  give him the part. It worked. As did his brooding, funny, horny performance. A
  star was born right there among the suds. 3. The Age of Innocence (1993) The
  critic Jonathan Romney floated the theory that Newland Archer, the elegant
  lawyer played by Day-Lewis in Martin Scorsese’s rapturous adaptation of Edith
  Wharton’s study of late-19th century New York mores, was a “soul brother” to
  Jake La Motta in Raging Bull: “He simply wears fancier gloves.” There is
  certainly a seam of cunning and coldness in Day-Lewis’s performance, but there
  is boyish wonder too, especially in the gasping, enchanted laugh he lets slip
  whenever Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) does something irreverent or
  iconoclastic. As Archer tries to expedite his marriage to her cousin May
  (Winona Ryder) in an attempt to quell his feelings for the countess, Day-Lewis
  strikes and sustains a note of tortured panache. 2. My Left Foot (1989) Two
  contradictory things are true of Jim Sheridan’s film about the artist and
  writer Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. One: there is no
  excuse for a disabled actor not to have been cast in the role. And two:
  Day-Lewis – who won his first Oscar for this – is astonishing in it. The first
  of three projects with Sheridan, this marked the beginnings of the Daniel
  Day-Loopy PR machine, as stories abounded of the lengths to which he went to
  stay authentically in character: never leaving his wheelchair, having to be
  carried over the cables on set, contorting his body so fiercely that he broke
  two ribs during filming. The movie hasn’t endured as well as it might: it ends
  on a happy-ever-after with Brown’s future-wife Mary Carr, who, it was later
  alleged by his biographer Georgia Louise Hambleton, isolated and abused him.
  1. There Will Be Blood (2007) The comedian Adam Riches once called Day-Lewis
  “the greatest actor never to appear in anyone’s favourite film”. Paul Thomas
  Anderson’s awe-inspiring character-study-disguised-as-an-epic gives the lie to
  that quip. Speaking in the corroded rumble of John Huston’s Noah Cross from
  Chinatown (another monstrous devourer of people and land alike), Day-Lewis is
  extraordinary as Daniel Plainview, a rapacious early-20th century Californian
  oil prospector. In a performance that can be summed up as long overcast
  periods interrupted by all hell breaking loose, usually with Paul Dano on the
  receiving end as the pipsqueak preacher who is Plainview’s sole adversary,
  Day-Lewis doesn’t make us like Plainview or even understand his cruelty, but
  we absolutely believe in him. And, as with all great monster movies, we are
  eager to see what he breaks next. After nearly three hours in his company,
  audiences are likely to develop a severe case of Stockholm syndrome.
