  Sir Kenneth Calman was a doctor, public servant and academic leader whose
  identity as a proud Scot underpinned his values of compassion, ethics and hard
  work. In the 1970s, as the University of Glasgow’s first professor of
  oncology, Calman, who has died aged 83, set up networks of cancer patients who
  could share their experience of living with the disease and its treatment with
  fellow sufferers and medical practitioners. Later, as chief medical officer
  for England, 1991-98, he advised the UK government on the risks to human
  health during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak.
  Demonstrating his skill at handling contentious issues, from 2007 until 2009
  Calman chaired the Commission on Scottish Devolution – known as the Calman
  commission – which had been set up by Scottish Labour and the other minority
  unionist parties in the Scottish parliament against opposition from the ruling
  Scottish National party. Its report was published in 2009, and its
  recommendations, described as “significant but gentle surgery on the body
  politic” by BBC Scotland’s political correspondent Andrew Kerr, were largely
  incorporated into the Scotland Act of 2012. After training in transplant
  surgery in Glasgow, from the mid-1970s Calman shifted to cancer medicine at a
  time when more effective treatments were becoming available. He was also
  influenced by the work of Dame Cicely Saunders on palliative care. Convinced
  that a patient-centred approach to treatment was essential, in 1980 he set up
  the Scottish charity Tak Tent (Take Care, later Cancer Support Scotland), to
  give patients a voice in their care. His first foray into public service came
  when he was appointed chief medical officer for Scotland, a post he held from
  1989 until 1991. At the time Edinburgh had an unenviable reputation as the
  “Aids capital of Europe”. On his watch the Lothian Health Board launched a
  “frank and fun” safe sex campaign, also called Take Care, which was in marked
  contrast to the doomy Aids: Don’t Die of Ignorance campaign that ran in
  England. Recognising that HIV in Scotland was transmitted principally through
  intravenous drug use, Scotland’s health authorities developed and expanded
  needle exchange programmes. Calman was immediately catapulted into the same
  role for England, based in the UK Department of Health (DoH), to succeed Sir
  Donald Acheson in 1991. Like Acheson, Calman was concerned about possible
  links between BSE and the human brain disorder known as new variant
  Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (nvCJD), but was falsely reassured by the Ministry
  of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) that no bovine offal, such as spinal
  cord, was entering the human food chain. Both he and Acheson faced criticism
  in the report of the subsequent Phillips inquiry for making unwarranted
  statements about the safety of British beef. But as the inquiry recognised,
  neither had been able to make statements independently of officials in both
  Maff and the DoH, who were determined to play down anything that might damage
  the beef industry. Reflecting on his decade as chief medical officer in two
  countries, Calman later wryly wrote: “The CMO is effectively at the head of a
  medical intelligence operation and in theory should be relied upon to have his
  or her finger on the pulse of new developments. In practice, this isn’t always
  possible.” Calman was born in the Knightswood suburb of Glasgow, the elder son
  of Grace (nee Don) and Arthur Calman. His father, a mechanic with a textiles
  company, died of a heart attack when Kenneth was nine, leaving his mother, who
  worked as a secretary, to raise Kenneth and his brother, Norman. He later
  credited the Knightswood library with feeding his thirst for learning. His
  precocious intelligence won him a place at the selective Allan Glen’s school,
  open at a much-reduced fee to Glasgow boys who passed the entrance exam. He
  then received a scholarship to study medicine at the University of Glasgow,
  receiving a degree in biochemistry in 1964 and qualifying in medicine in 1967.
  His connections with the university were lifelong. He held teaching and
  research posts in surgery there until 1972, when he went to London to take up
  a research fellowship at the Institute of Cancer Research’s Chester Beatty
  laboratories in Chelsea. He returned to Glasgow as its first professor of
  oncology in 1974, later becoming dean of postgraduate medicine and professor
  of postgraduate medical education. He was a strong advocate for the arts in
  medicine, for a public health approach to the training of doctors, and for
  recognition that social inequalities are significant determinants of ill
  health. After his major public service roles and a stint as vice-chancellor
  and warden of the University of Durham, in 2006 he was elected chancellor of
  the University of Glasgow, a position he held until 2020. During this time he
  became a student again, crowning his lifelong love of the literature of his
  country with a master’s in Scottish literature and medicine in 2012. A poet
  and author of almost a dozen books, including Storytelling, Humour and
  Learning in Medicine (2001) and an autobiography, It Started in a Cupboard
  (2019), he chaired the National Library of Scotland and was deputy chair of
  the British Library. Among many other honours, he was knighted in 1996.
  “Through learning I help others” was the translation of the Latin motto on
  Calman’s coat of arms. His dedication to knowledge was leavened by an impish
  sense of humour – though perhaps he was not entirely joking when he told his
  government bosses that the best way to improve the nation’s health would be to
  reintroduce rationing. His colleague at Glasgow University Beverly Bergman
  said: “He was a delightful man whose gentle manner concealed a brilliant,
  all-encompassing mind.” Calman met Ann Wilkie in 1960 when they were both
  students, and they married in 1967. A former deputy headteacher, she survives
  him, along with their three children, Andrew, Lynn and Susan. • Kenneth
