  humans’ jobs

  OpenAI has claimed to have taken a “significant step” towards artificial
  general intelligence (AGI) with the launch of its latest upgrade to ChatGPT,
  but has admitted there are still “many things” missing in its quest to create
  a system able to do humans’ jobs. The startup said its GPT-5 model, the
  underlying technology that will power its breakthrough AI chatbot, represents
  a big upgrade on its predecessors in areas such as coding and creative writing
  – and is also a lot less sycophantic. It said the upgrade was being made
  available to all of ChatGPT’s 700 million weekly users immediately. Sam
  Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, called the model a “significant step
  forward” to achieving the theoretical state of AGI, which the startup defines
  as a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically
  valuable work – or, in other words, can do their jobs. However, Altman
  admitted GPT-5 had not reached that goal yet. “[It is] missing something quite
  important, many things quite important,” said Altman, pointing to the model’s
  inability to “continuously learn”. Altman said GPT-5 was “generally
  intelligent” and a “significant step on the path to AGI” but had not reached
  it yet by most people’s definition. “I think the way that most of us define
  AGI, we’re still missing something quite important, many things quite
  important. But one big one is … this is not a model that continuously learns
  as it’s deployed from things it finds, which is something that, to me, feels
  like it should be part of AGI,” he said, adding that, nonetheless, it was a
  “huge improvement” on its predecessors. During a GPT-5 launch event on
  Thursday, Altman said this latest version of ChatGPT was like having “access
  to a PhD-level expert in your pocket”. He described the previous version of
  the chatbot as a college student, and the version before that as a high school
  student. AGI’s theoretical capabilities, and the determination of heavily
  backed tech companies to achieve it, has led to predictions from AI executives
  that white-collar jobs – from lawyers to accountants, doctors and bankers –
  will be wiped out by looming advances in the technology. Dario Amodei, the
  boss of AI developer Anthropic, has warned the technology could replace half
  of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. OpenAI said the main
  improvements in GPT-5 included: fewer factual errors, or hallucinations;
  better software coding, allowing it to create functional websites and apps;
  increased capability at creative writing; and, rather than “refusing” a prompt
  that breaches its guidelines outright, the model will instead try to give the
  most helpful response possible within safety guidelines, or at least explain
  why it cannot help. The agent feature in ChatGPT – which carries out tasks
  such as finding restaurant availability and shopping online – will also be
  able to access users’ Gmail, Google calendar and contacts, if given
  permission. As with its predecessors, GPT-5 can generate voice, image and text
  and can deal with queries in those formats too. The company on Thursday demoed
  how GPT-5 can write hundreds of lines of code in seconds and create tools such
  as a French-language learning programme. Staff said the technology is also
  writing less robotically and had the chatbot create a “more nuanced” eulogy.
  Altman said ChatGPT was a good tool for healthcare advice too, bringing on
  stage a woman who had been diagnosed with cancer last year to talk about how
  the chatbot helped her decide whether or not to get radiation therapy. The
  company said the upgraded ChatGPT would be better at answering health-related
  questions and would be more proactive at “flagging potential concerns” – such
  as serious physical or mental illness, too. The startup stressed the chatbot
  was not a replacement for professional help, amid concerns AI tools could
  worsen the condition of people vulnerable to psychosis. Nick Turley, the head
  of ChatGPT at OpenAI, said the model showed “significant improvements on
  sycophancy”, after the startup’s admission this year that the chatbot’s most
  sophisticated model had become too agreeable and could distress users or make
  them uncomfortable. The latest model release comes as tech firms pour
  multibillion-dollar sums into their attempts to achieve AGI. On Tuesday,
  Google’s AI unit outlined its latest step towards AGI by showcasing an
  unreleased “world model”, while last week Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook
  parent Meta, said the development of superintelligence – another theoretical
  state of AI even more powerful than AGI – was “now in sight”. Investors’ faith
  in the potential for further breakthroughs, and AI’s ability to transform
  modern economies, has also spurred a valuation boom in companies such as San
  Francisco-based OpenAI. It was reported on Wednesday that OpenAI is in early
  talks about a sale of shares held by current and former employees that would
  value it at $500bn, overtaking Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Although OpenAI also
  released two open models this week and has a free version of ChatGPT, the
  company makes its revenues from charging for subscriptions to the most
  powerful versions of the chatbot and from integrating its models into
  businesses’ IT systems. Use of the free version of GPT-5-backed ChatGPT will
  be capped, while users on the $200-a-month Pro package will get unlimited
  access.
