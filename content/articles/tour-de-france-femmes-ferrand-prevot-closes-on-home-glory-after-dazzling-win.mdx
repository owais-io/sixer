  Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, the Olympic mountain bike gold medallist at Paris
  2024, took a commanding overall lead in the Tour de France Femmes after a
  spectacular lone victory at the summit of the Col de la Madeleine. With one
  stage remaining in the nine-day race, the 33-year-old from Reims is on the
  verge of ending French cycling’s 40 years wait by ending the long wait for a
  successor to Bernard Hinault’s 1985 win in the men’s Tour de France.
  Ferrand-Prévot, unlike many of those watching at the roadside, held back the
  tears until after an embrace from the Tour director, Marion Rousse. “I’ve
  realised a little girl’s dream, it’s a perfect day,” Ferrand-Prévot said after
  taking the yellow jersey. “I have to thank the public and my family who were
  here at the roadside.” Her solo success on the Tour’s queen stage went beyond
  the host country’s highest expectations and crushed the hopes of the defending
  champion, Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney, as well as the 2023 champion, Demi
  Vollering, who were left behind on the long climb to the 2,000m Haute-Savoie
  mountain top. “It was a big effort for over an hour, hour and a half of
  climbing, and I had to manage it,” Ferrand-Prévot said. “But it’s really been
  a team effort all week and it’s as much for them as it is for me.” For a
  Visma-Lease a Bike team who were once again dominated by Tadej Pogacar in the
  men’s Tour de France, it was a sweet success. With just the final stage, from
  Praz-sur-Arly to Châtel, remaining, Ferrand-Prévot leads the Australian
  climber Sarah Gigante by more than two-and-a-half minutes and Vollering by
  three minutes and 18 seconds. Niewiadoma-Phinney is a further half-minute
  behind. Ferrand-Prévot said: “I’ve still got to finish the job, but one year
  after the Games in Paris, to win here, on this mythic climb, it’s incredible.”
  The sense the race had been unsettled before the summit finishes was
  emphasised by the stop-start racing on the approach to the beyond category
  summit finish on the Madeleine, where the fight for the yellow jersey finally
  began. The pivotal moment came 12km from the summit when Gigante pulled clear
  of the favourites, with Pauliena Rooijakkers and Ferrand-Prévot in pursuit.
  Gigante, teammate to the overnight race leader, Kim Le Court, has struggled to
  keep pace on the descents, but her rapid climbing has compensated for that
  shortcoming. This time, though, Ferrand-Prévot was quick to respond to her
  sharp acceleration and the pair soon joined forces. The French rider also
  benefited from her Visma-Lease a Bike team’s tactics. Marion Bunel went in the
  early break, waiting ahead to pace her teammate up the climb. That gave her
  the respite she needed, before she dropped her final companion, Niamh
  Fisher-Black, five kilometres from the finish. Le Court, Niewiadoma-Phinney
  and Vollering had little or no meaningful response so Ferrand-Prévot’s
  climbing speed. It was a tough day for Le Court. The descending speed that had
  saved her overall lead on the previous stage to Chambéry let her down 24 hours
  later, when she raced too fast into a tight left-hand bend and somersaulted
  into a ditch. None of her rivals waited for the race leader as she got to her
  feet and remounted. If anything the peloton of favourites pushed on even
  harder as Le Court dropped almost a minute behind. However, in the valley road
  leading to the next climb, the Côte de Saint-Georges d’Hurtières, the peloton
  slowed and Le Court rejoined the main group. After that, she led the way at
  the foot of the Madeleine, hoping to set up Gigante. Her efforts were not in
  vain, but she and Gigante had not factored in Ferrand-Prévot’s extended
  climbing powers. “Other teams don’t know what’s coming,” Le Court had said of
  Gigante’s climbing skills. But they had reckoned without Ferrand-Prévot. Now
  drawing huge crowds to the roadside and growing TV audiences, the fourth
  edition of the Tour Femmes, has built further on the success of the first
  three. “I really felt something big was happening,” Rousse said. “I had tears
  in my eyes. I was a little overwhelmed because women’s cycling has come so
  far.” Rousse also revealed that Christian Prudhomme, director of the men’s
  Tour, had said to her: “I no longer see any difference between the two Tours
  de France.” • This article was amended on 3 August 2025. An earlier version
  misspelled the surname of Marion Bunel.
