  Authorities in Copenhagen could face a bill of tens of millions of krone after
  it emerged that the city had illegally charged wedding fees to about 12,000
  couples over seven years. Most of those who were charged during the period are
  understood to have been from outside Denmark and did not have permanent
  residence in the country. Copenhagen municipality could be forced to repay up
  to 23m krone (£2.7m). A fee of up to 4,500 krone was charged for weddings at
  the city hall at particular times and for weddings at designated outdoor
  locations. But under Danish law, the municipality is allowed to charge the fee
  only if the couple has asked to be married outside the city hall. Wedding
  tourism represents big business for the city: last year, about 5,000
  international couples were married in Copenhagen, spending as much as 120m
  krone, according to the Danish chamber of commerce. Lars Ramme Nielsen, a
  director at the chamber of commerce, said the situation was “unfortunate”.
  “For many reasons, we have been very pleased that so many foreign couples
  choose Copenhagen as the place to seal their love,” he said. “At the same
  time, we are not blind to the significant revenue these guests bring with them
  – everything from hotels, restaurants and the airport, to local photographers,
  florists and many more. We very much hope a solution can be found.” Some
  politicians have called for the law to be changed so that the municipality is
  legally permitted to charge all non-Danish couples to get married. Niels Peder
  Ravn, a Conservative member of Copenhagen’s culture and leisure committee,
  said that although he was “delighted” the Danish capital had become such a
  popular international wedding destination, he was outraged that city taxpayers
  would be left to foot the bill. “I call it the wedding scandal, as it means
  Copenhagen taxpayers must now repay 23m krone to approximately 12,000 foreign
  couples,” he said. “These are funds we will have to find within the culture
  and leisure committee’s budget, which will result in fewer sports activities
  and cultural offerings for Copenhagen’s citizens.” He added: “I am also deeply
  concerned about the countless hours of work the administration will need to
  spend locating these many couples, who, as they do not live in Denmark, may
  not be so easy to track down.” Copenhagen’s mayor for culture and leisure, Mia
  Nyegaard, said the illegal practice, which had continued since 2018 until it
  was discovered earlier this year, was “really unfortunate and regrettable”.
  She added: “How Copenhagen has at the same time been able to market itself as
  a wedding destination, I simply do not know. I have no answer to that. But I
  have been informed that the practice started in 2018 and was discovered when
  the administration, in the spring of 2025, reviewed the financial and legal
  basis for the wedding office due to the increasing demand for weddings. At
  that point, the administration became aware of the incorrect practice and
  stopped it completely.” No longer being able to charge the fees, she said,
  “presents a financial challenge” that was expected to grow as demand for
  weddings increased. She added: “Therefore, the culture and leisure committee
  must now discuss how it should be handled. At the same time, the culture and
  leisure administration is in the process of planning the work for the
  repayments in collaboration with the city of Copenhagen’s internal audit unit.
  It is too early to say anything concrete about how this task will be carried
  out.” The Danish ministry of social affairs and housing has been contacted for
  comment.
