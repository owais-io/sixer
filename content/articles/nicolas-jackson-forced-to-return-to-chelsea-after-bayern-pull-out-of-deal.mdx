  Nicolas Jackson has been left frustrated after Bayern Munich called off their
  attempt to revive a deal to sign the striker on loan from Chelsea. Jackson is
  due to return to London but is understood to be disappointed with how the
  situation has played out. Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, may face a
  challenge to lift the forward’s spirits when he rejoins the squad after the
  international break. It had seemed Jackson was set for a new challenge when he
  was given permission to fly to Munich on Saturday after Bayern reached an
  agreement on a loan with an option to buy for €65m (£56m). However, Chelsea
  contacted the German club to inform them that they would not permit the deal
  to go ahead after Liam Delap sustained a hamstring injury against Fulham later
  in the day. Delap is due to have a second scan this week and although it is
  hoped that the damage is not severe enough to require surgery the striker is
  expected to be out for at least eight weeks. Maresca is reluctant to proceed
  with only one fit striker given his team’s packed schedule over the next two
  months. However, Chelsea’s instruction for Jackson to return to London on
  Saturday afternoon fell on deaf ears at first. The Senegal international
  remained in Bavaria with his representatives, who spent much of Sunday trying
  to find a solution with Bayern. But with Chelsea willing to consider only a
  permanent deal, the Bundesliga champions walked away from talks over Jackson
  last night. Bayern, who spent heavily 12 months ago, only wanted a loan and
  are moving on to other targets. Chelsea were willing to let Jackson leave
  after buying João Pedro and Delap this summer. Jackson, who has scored 24
  goals in 65 Premier League appearances, has dropped down the pecking order and
  asked to leave in August. He has also been targeted by Aston Villa, Newcastle,
  Napoli and Juventus. It remains to be seen if anyone moves for Jackson before
  the transfer window shuts on Monday night. Newcastle could be an option if
  they sell Alexander Isak to Liverpool. Chelsea have considered contingency
  plans in the unlikely event of Jackson leaving. They are looking at permanent
  deals rather than loans and have made inquiries about a number of forwards,
  including Sporting Lisbon’s Conrad Harder. However, they have reached an
  agreement to recall Marc Guiu from his loan at Sunderland. Harder, a
  20-year-old Danish forward, joined Sporting from Nordsjælland last year and
  has scored six goals in 32 league appearances. RB Leizpig have been linked
  with Harder. Chelsea head into deadline day looking to move a number of
  players. They are open to offers for Tyrique George, Raheem Sterling, Ben
  Chilwell and Axel Disasi. Josh Acheampong, a target for Manchester City and
  Bayern, is not for sale.
