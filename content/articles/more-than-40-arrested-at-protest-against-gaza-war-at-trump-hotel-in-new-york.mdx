  More than 40 people protesting the war and worsening humanitarian crisis in
  Gaza were arrested outside the Trump International hotel in New York City on
  Monday evening. The protest, organized by IfNotNow, a Jewish-American
  anti-occupation group, had begun earlier in the evening at Columbus Circle.
  Hundreds gathered under the banner “Trump: Jews Say No More” to demand an end
  to the war in Gaza and that the Trump administration pressure Israel to allow
  greater humanitarian aid to enter into territory, as health officials there
  continue to report deaths from starvation and malnutrition. “Let’s not mince
  words, the Israeli government’s blockade of Gaza is a policy of ethnic
  cleansing by way of forced mass starvation,” said Morriah Kaplan, IfNotNow’s
  interim executive director, during her speech to the crowd. “It is an
  unbearable, unspeakable, unfathomable affront to our shared humanity and those
  who are carrying it out and are deploying our Jewish symbols, language and
  traditions to defend and justify it, which is why I’m heartened to see such a
  range of Jews and Jewish organizations coming together today to say with one
  voice that we oppose these atrocities, not in spite of our Judaism, but for
  many of us, because of it.” “We need the US government to use its considerable
  leverage to end these horrors,” she added. Protesters held signs that read
  “stop ethnic cleansing”, “never again is now”, “stop starving Gaza” and “not
  in our name”, and speakers included Ruth Messinger, Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the
  T’ruah CEO, and Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller. “Yesterday was the
  Jewish holiday of Tisha B’Av in which Jews mourn the destruction of the people
  of Israel,” Lander said, “and what we’re witnessing right now is destruction
  caused by the state of Israel.” “Its been going on for many months,” he added.
  “But to witness forced mass starvation, emaciated children and starving of
  families, on top of all the bombing and destruction and displacement, it is
  necessary for Jews to cry out louder, to do more organizing to make sure that
  we stop sending offensive weapons and bombs and guns that we demand an end to
  what Israel is doing in Gaza. That’s why we’re here tonight.” Also in
  attendance was Lily Greenberg Call, a former special assistant to the chief of
  staff at the US Department of the Interior under the Biden-Harris
  administration who publicly resigned in protest in May 2024 over the
  administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. “I was the first, and
  unfortunately the only official Jewish official to publicly resign in protest
  of the administration’s unconditional support for Israel during the war in
  Gaza,” Greenberg Call said in an interview with Guardian. Greenberg Call said
  that she was noticing new people among the crowd protesting Israel’s war in
  Gaza. “There is something shifting,” she said. “Showing up is really
  important, and our role as Americans especially – our government and our tax
  dollars are funding this.” “We have an obligation, specifically as American
  Jews, to stand up against what’s happening in our name,” Greenberg Call added.
  Palestinian photojournalist, Motaz Azaiza, was also in the crowd and delivered
  brief remarks. Just after 8pm, the group began walking to the Trump
  International hotel. They gathered in front of the hotel, sitting in the
  street, singing and chanting. Around 8.15pm ET, New York police department
  officers began arresting protesters for blocking the street. It was unclear as
  of 9pm how many people were arrested but the Guardian counted at least more
  than 40 people. Those arrested were loaded on to police vans and the crowd
  dispersed shortly after. In a press release issued after the arrests occurred,
  IfNotNow said that this mobilization marked “the broadest tent coalition in
  the Jewish community against the atrocities in Gaza in the last two years,
  representing the vast majority of US Jews who are outraged by the actions of
  the Israeli government in Gaza”.
