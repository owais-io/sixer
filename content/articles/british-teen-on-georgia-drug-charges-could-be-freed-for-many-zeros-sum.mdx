  The pregnant British teenager Bella Culley has reportedly been told she will
  be released from the Georgian prison where she is being held on drug-smuggling
  charges if she pays a substantial fine. Culley, from Billingham, on Teesside,
  has been detained in the former Soviet country for more than three months
  after being accused of trying to bring in 14kg of cannabis in a travel bag.
  She has been told she faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Fears were
  first expressed for her safety when she went missing during a holiday in
  Thailand in May. She surfaced nearly 4,000 miles away in the Georgian capital,
  Tblisi, where she was arrested. She marked her 19th birthday in prison the
  following month, and during a court appearance in July it emerged she is
  expecting a baby boy. Her lawyer, Malkhaz Salakaia, had tried to secure her
  release pending a trial, telling Tbilisi city court: “I want her to feel this
  motherhood in freedom.” However, the judge decided no new evidence had been
  presented and ordered that Culley remain in prison. On Tuesday, the BBC
  reported Culley was back in court, where the judge, Giorgi Gelashvili, was
  told defence and prosecution teams had been negotiating the terms of a plea
  agreement that would result in Culley being freed in return for a sum of money
  with “many zeros”. It was reported the lawyers were referring to Georgian lari
  – £1 is worth ₾3.60. The prosecutor argued Culley posed a flight risk and
  could reoffend if allowed bail, the BBC reported. Gelashvili ruled that she
  must remain in custody until the next hearing, on 9 October, unless an
  agreement was reached sooner. The Foreign Office has previously said it was
  “supporting the family of a British woman who is detained in Georgia”.
  Cleveland police, on Teesside, have confirmed an 18-year-old woman from
  Billingham was arrested in Georgia on suspicion of drug offences in May.
