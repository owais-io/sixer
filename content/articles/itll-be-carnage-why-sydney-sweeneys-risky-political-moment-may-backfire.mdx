  It is one of the questionable perks of Donald Trump’s “wall of sound” approach
  to communication that the slightly icky moment when the world of Maga
  connected with one of Hollywood’s hottest young stars was broadcast live and
  uncut. As the US president boarded Air Force One, a reporter asked whether he
  had any thoughts on Sydney Sweeney, a “very hot actress right now”, being a
  registered Republican. Of course he did. “She’s a registered Republican? Ooh,
  now I love her ad. Is that right? Is Sydney Sweeney … You’d be surprised at
  how many people are Republicans. That’s what I wouldn’t have known. But I’m
  glad you told me that. If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think
  her ad is fantastic.” Sweeney, for the uninitiated, and there can’t be many,
  first gained prominence for her roles in HBO’s Euphoria and The White Lotus
  and more recently co-starred in the thriller Echo Valley with Julianne Moore.
  It has, however, been the 27-year-old’s “more is best” approach to commercial
  tie-ups and a tendency for the social media algorithms to promote her that has
  made the actor inescapable. She is everywhere, smiling with a dab of
  rejuvenating cream on her face, straining to inject cool into clog-shaped
  black loafers or taking selfies with a dog to promote Samsung flip phones. She
  can even be found in your bath tub thanks to a collaboration with a men’s
  personal care company to create a soap called Sydney’s Bathwater Bliss that
  contains a small amount of the actual water in which she has washed. Her
  latest advertising campaign has led her into more dangerous waters. “Genes are
  passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair
  colour, personality, and even eye colour,” she purrs in an advert for American
  Eagle denims. “My genes are blue,” she says as the camera lingers on her eyes.
  The strap line: Sydney Sweeney has great jeans. The whiff of controversy was
  inevitably picked up with claims that the ad was elevating the white, blond
  and blue eyed. One TikTok reaction video that received hundreds of thousands
  of likes commented “it’s literally giving … Nazi propaganda”. JD Vance, never
  one to miss such a moment, criticised the unhinged Dems and hailed an
  “all-American beautiful woman”. “So much of the Democrats is oriented around
  hostility to basic American life,” he added. Then, amid the extra scrutiny of
  the woman behind the storm, it emerged that Sweeney had registered as a
  Republican voter in Florida a few months before Trump won his second US
  presidency. As Trump’s delight illustrated, the benefit to the president is
  clear, said David Cracknell, a former political editor of Rupert Murdoch’s
  Sunday Times who now runs his own PR company. There is a long history of
  politicians chasing the celebrity endorsement, with JFK among the earliest to
  spot the benefits of having Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr on
  his side. Last summer, Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic
  Governance and Innovation published research that suggested celebrity voices
  could be “incredibly powerful” in promoting civic engagement and altering
  polling numbers. Online voter registration and poll worker volunteer rates
  were found to increase when a celebrity promoted them. Celebrity endorsements
  from the likes of Taylor Swift and Oprah Winfrey did not help Kamala Harris’s
  cause at the last election but the tacit endorsement of a young woman could be
  particularly helpful at a time when Trump is under pressure over his past
  relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. However,
  Cracknell said the upside for the celebrity was far less clear. “It usually
  does end in tears when any celebrity gets involved in politics, just look at
  Kanye West and how his endorsement for Trump was mixed up with his
  reputational downfall,” said Cracknell. “Then he said later that he felt used
  by Trump. More fool you for getting involved because the politicians are much
  better at manipulating the media, they are doing it on a second by second
  basis, Trump literally.” Mark Borkowski, whose PR clients have included
  Michael Jackson, Joan Rivers and Van Morrison, said avoiding political
  entanglements, particularly in the infancy of a career when hopefuls rely on
  goodwill from all sides, was vital. When Taylor Swift praised two Democratic
  candidates in her home state of Tennessee back in 2018 it led to a fearsome
  backlash but she stuck to her guns, going on to back Joe Biden and Kamala
  Harris for president. It can hardly be said that her career has suffered but
  Swift was established, said Borkowski, as were other celebrities, such as John
  Wayne and Charlton Heston who threw themselves into political causes, the
  former with the Republican party and the latter the civil rights movement and
  then the National Rifle Association. “I am fascinated by Sydney Sweeney,”
  Borkowski said. “She’s become the sort of delicious siren of the gen Z media.
  She has got all the echoes of Jayne Mansfield or Marilyn Monroe, but she’s
  totally overpromoted. “She’s clickbait and it’s the worst idea to declare a
  political affiliation, especially in the inferno that is American discourse.
  It’s a massive PR risk because she hasn’t made it yet. She is not Margot
  Robbie, she does not have Oscars behind her.” As if to illustrate the danger
  for celebrities who dip a toe in American politics, Trump later doubled down
  on his Truth Social platform to praise Sweeney’s instincts and castigate
  Swift. He said: “Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying
  on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!) She was booed out of the Super Bowl
  and became NO LONGER HOT. “The tide has seriously turned – Being WOKE is for
  losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention
  to this matter!” Sweeney is yet to comment on her political sympathies but
  plenty of others, beyond Trump, will have a say, said Borkowski. “Silence in
  politics is really important now because if you don’t, you’re going to be
  exposed by the full weight of the opposition on social media,” he said. “It’ll
  be carnage. She’s a bombshell, but she’s not box office yet.”
