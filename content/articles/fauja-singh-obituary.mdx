  The British Sikh marathon runner Fauja Singh, who has died aged 114 in a
  traffic accident, became known globally as the “Turbaned Tornado”. He was the
  first person over the age of 100 to complete a marathon when he ran the
  Toronto waterfront marathon in 2011. This achievement was not officially
  recognised by Guinness World Records as Fauja did not have a birth
  certificate, but his feat captured international attention. His love for
  running came late in life when, at the age of 89, after seeing people running
  on television, he decided to give it a go. He ran his first marathon in London
  in 2000. He was deeply committed to charitable causes, and saw running as a
  spiritual act of Sewa (selfless service). I first met Fauja around 13 years
  ago while hiking up Snowdon for a charity event with my parents. What stood
  out immediately was that he was wearing a suit and formal shoes, rather than
  trainers or sportswear, and despite the cold he was smiling warmly. We asked
  him how he had so much energy. He replied, “It’s all because of Waheguru,”
  meaning “wonderful God.” Fauja was born in Beas Pind, a village in the
  Jalandhar districtof what was then British India. Birth certificates were not
  issued in Indian villages at the time, although he later registered for a
  passport, and it is thought he was born on 1 April 1911. His father, Mehr
  Singh, was a farmer, and his mother, Bhago Kaur, was a housewife. As a child,
  Fauja was extremely frail and struggled to walk until the age of five. Over
  time, he gained strength, although he did not go to school, and was able to
  work on the family farm. He married Gian Kaur and they had six children. After
  her death in 1992, he emigrated to the UK to live with his son Sukhjinder in
  Ilford, east London, where running soon became his passion. He finished his
  first marathon in London in 6 hours, 54 minutes. When he completed the Toronto
  waterfront marathon in 2003 in 5 hours, 40 minutes, his personal best, the
  organisers were so surprised they re-measured the course, just in case. Fauja
  regularly appeared at charity events. On one occasion, when I was volunteering
  with Nishkam SWAT in 2015, he spent time learning about the work we were doing
  to feed homeless people. When I mentioned that my father wanted to run a
  marathon and asked if it was hard, Fauja smiled and said: “The first 20 miles
  of a marathon are not difficult. The last six miles – I run while talking to
  God.” He helped numerous charities, donating an endorsement fee from Adidas in
  2004 to Bliss, which supports premature and sick babies. He was a man of deep
  faith, joy, humility and service. Having travelled to India in 2019 shortly
  before the Covid pandemic began, he never returned to Britain but settled
  again in his home village of Beas Pind, where he lived with his son Harvinder.
  He is survived by Sukhjinder and Harvinder, and by two daughters, 14
  grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
