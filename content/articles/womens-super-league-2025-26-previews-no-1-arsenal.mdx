  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 1st (NB: this is not necessarily Suzanne
  Wrack’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 2nd Prospects Just how impactful can a stunning Champions League win
  be on the psychology of a team that has struggled to challenge domestically in
  recent years? We are about to find out. Arsenal’s battling run to Lisbon and
  subsequent victory over Barcelona ended a north London trophy drought, yet it
  has still been six years since the most decorated women’s team in England won
  a Women’s Super League title. Back-to-back League Cup wins in 2023 and 2024
  ensured the cupboard was filled somewhat during that time, but those were
  widely viewed as not enough for a club with such an illustrious history, and
  certainly did not match up with the level of investment being pumped into the
  team. Ending Chelsea’s dominance of the WSL is the focus of every team looking
  to challenge at the top and Arsenal are no different. For the latest challenge
  they boast players riding high on the crest of a trophy-laden wave, with five
  European champions for club and country in their squad following England’s
  triumph in Switzerland. The key is finding consistency across the four
  competitions that have eluded them in recent years. Renée Slegers’ squad has
  been strengthened, with the world-record fee paid for Olivia Smith a real
  statement of intent. It has, however, also suffered the blow of Leah
  Williamson being ruled out for the start of the campaign following a knee
  procedure. Arsenal have for some time weathered accusations that they can sell
  out crowds but can’t win trophies. May’s glory in Lisbon has quashed that
  narrative, but the onus is on them now to deliver domestic success. All the
  ingredients for success are there and, in Slegers, they have a manager clearly
  capable of bringing them together and cooking up a treat. The manager Slegers’
  time at the helm following the departure of Jonas Eidevall in October has
  rightly led to a place on the shortlist for the Ballon d’Or women’s coach of
  the year award for the 36-year-old. At the start of last season, Slegers was a
  relative unknown; an assistant coach at Arsenal who stepped into the breach
  following a poor start to the season that led to Eidevall’s resignation. An
  unbeaten run up to the winter break and qualification for the Champions League
  knockout stage prompted a permanent contract and Arsenal flourished, her
  inclusive approach and the culture she has encouraged yielding remarkable
  results. Now Slegers has had the chance to further shape the team the way she
  wants it. Off-field picture The decision to host all WSL games at the Emirates
  Stadium this season will further elevate Arsenal’s financial position. The
  club have sold 15,000 season tickets for the main stadium, having increased
  the number of fixtures they’ve played at the ground year on year. From the
  2023 financial year to 2024, Arsenal’s matchday turnover rose from £2.7m to
  £4.4m; the impact of last season’s games at the Emirates on the club’s
  finances will be evident next year and the full effects of a permanent
  WSL-related move to the ground will be seen in the 2027 filings. The scale of
  the crowds at the Emirates is of benefit to other WSL clubs too, with players
  from across the world wanting to play there. Star signing The recruitment of
  Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal following the conclusion of her successful
  loan spell from Manchester City is significant, but the signing of Smith is a
  huge statement of intent. After missing out on Naomi Girma and Keira Walsh,
  who joined Chelsea, and having reportedly failed with record bids for Mary
  Earps and Alessia Russo (before the latter was signed on a free), Arsenal
  needed a big transfer. Smith shone at Liverpool and was named the Professional
  Footballers’ Association young player of the year earlier this month. She is a
  star. Stepping up Kyra Cooney-Cross made 19 WSL appearances for Arsenal last
  season, starting 10 times, and displayed maturity and confidence on the ball.
  The 23-year-old has spent time during the summer training with Myles
  Lewis-Skelly as she looks to ramp up her influence on the side. Supplanting
  the mercurial Kim Little and the defensive-midfield maestro Lia Wälti is no
  mean feat but Cooney-Cross is undoubtedly snapping at their heels. This season
  could well be the year where the Australian shakes off the prospect label and
  becomes a mainstay. It was a good summer for … It would be neglectful to pick
  out one of Arsenal’s victorious Lionesses given all of them were influential
  in a bruising and thrilling Euros campaign. Kelly was the gamechanger, Russo
  led the line, Beth Mead was hugely impactful and, despite not playing a minute
  of football, Lotte Wubben-Moy’s influence on the side is held in high regard.
  Then there was Williamson, the captain, and Michelle Agyemang, who was the
  tournament’s breakout star and has departed for another loan spell at Brighton
  as part of the 19-year-old’s ongoing development. Agyemang will no doubt
  return to Arsenal given how highly rated she is in north London. Main
  initiative to attract more fans The decision to host all WSL games at the
  Emirates has been in the works for some time, part of a long-term strategy
  that has led to large crowds for the women’s games in N5, and it is no
  accident Arsenal have broken attendance record after attendance record. The
  decision to play Champions League group-stage games at Borehamwood may feel
  like a step back, but with Arsenal struggling to maintain their high
  attendances on weekday evenings, there is logic to the decision. The next
  phase is managing player access with so many more fans in attendance, and the
  club will draw from a ballot of season-ticket holders and six-game bundle
  buyers before each game for a meet-and-greet to curb the growing pressure on
  players to spend up to an hour or more signing autographs and taking photos
  after games.
