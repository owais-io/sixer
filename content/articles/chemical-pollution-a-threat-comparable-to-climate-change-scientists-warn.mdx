  Chemical pollution is “a threat to the thriving of humans and nature of a
  similar order as climate change” but decades behind global heating in terms of
  public awareness and action, a report has warned. The industrial economy has
  created more than 100 million “novel entities”, or chemicals not found in
  nature, with somewhere between 40,000 and 350,000 in commercial use and
  production, the report says. But the environmental and human health effects of
  this widespread contamination of the biosphere are not widely appreciated, in
  spite of a growing body of evidence linking chemical toxicity with effects
  ranging from ADHD to infertility to cancer. “I suppose that’s the biggest
  surprise for some people,” Harry Macpherson, senior climate associate at Deep
  Science Ventures (DSV), which carried out the research, told the Guardian.
  “Maybe people think that when you walk down the street breathing the air; you
  drink your water, you eat your food; you use your personal care products, your
  shampoo, cleaning products for your house, the furniture in your house; a lot
  of people assume that there’s really great knowledge and huge due diligence on
  the chemical safety of these things. But it really isn’t the case.” Over eight
  months, as part of a project funded by the Grantham Foundation, Macpherson and
  colleagues spoke to dozens of researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs
  and investors, and analysed hundreds of scientific papers. According to the
  DSV report, more than 3,600 synthetic chemicals from food contact materials –
  the materials that are used in food preparation and packaging – alone are
  found in human bodies, 80 of which are of significant concern. Pfas “forever
  chemicals”, for example, have been found in nearly all humans tested, and are
  now so ubiquitous that in many locations even rainwater contains levels
  regarded as unsafe to drink. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global population
  breathes air that breaches World Health Organization (WHO) pollution
  guidelines. When these chemicals contaminate our bodies, the results can be
  disastrous. The report found there were correlational or causal data linking
  widely used chemicals with threats to human reproductive, immune,
  neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney and metabolic
  systems. “One of the main things that came out quite strongly was links
  between pesticide exposure and reproductive issues,” said Macpherson. “We saw
  quite strong links – correlation and causation – for miscarriage and people
  basically struggling to conceive.” The DSV research adds to previous findings
  by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research that we have already far
  exceeded the safe planetary boundary for environmental pollutants, including
  plastics. On Sunday, another report warned that the world faces a “plastics
  crisis”, which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age amid a
  huge acceleration of plastic production. The report also highlights critical
  shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research and testing methods,
  exposing the ways in which existing checks and balances are failing to protect
  human and planetary health. “The way that we’ve generally done the testing has
  meant that we’ve missed a lot of effects,” Macpherson said. He singled out the
  assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are substances that
  interfere with hormones, causing problems ranging from infertility to cancer.
  These have been found to confound the traditional assumption that lower doses
  will invariably have lesser effects. “One of the things is that when you have
  a chemical which is interfering with the endocrine system, it sometimes has a
  nonlinear response. So you’ll see that there’ll be a response at a very low
  dose, which you wouldn’t be able to predict from its behaviour at a high
  dose.” DSV describes itself as a “venture creator” that spins out companies
  aimed at tackling big problems in environmental and human health issues. Part
  of the purpose of the report is to identify problem areas that can be tackled
  by innovation. Currently, chemical toxicity as an environmental issue receives
  just a fraction of the funding that is devoted to climate change, a
  disproportionality that Macpherson says should change. “We obviously don’t
  want less funding going into the climate and the atmosphere,” he said. “But
  this we think – really, proportionally – needs more attention.” However, there
  were features of the problem that mean it lends itself more easily to
  solutions. “The good thing is that this can be potentially quite easily
  consumer-driven if people start to worry about things they’re personally
  buying,” Macpherson said. “There isn’t necessarily the need for a massive
  collective action; it can just be demand for safer products, because people
  want safer products.” For his part, since starting the research, Macpherson is
  careful about what touches his food. He cooks with a cast-iron skillet. He
  especially avoids heating food in plastic. “Unfortunately, it is a
  recommendation to eat more organic food, but it is more expensive in general.
  So at least washing fruit and vegetables before eating them, but organic if
  you can afford it.”
