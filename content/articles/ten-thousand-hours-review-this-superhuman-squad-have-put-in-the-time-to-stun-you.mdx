  Ten Thousand Hours review – this superhuman squad have put in the time to stun
  you

  This may be the ideal festival show – it has supreme levels of skill but also
  humour and audience participation. There are gasps and laughs and even a
  gymnastic game of Pictionary. Australian circus company Gravity and Other
  Myths have already picked up multiple plaudits for Ten Thousand Hours,
  originally premiered in 2024 and still packing them in. There’s no shortage of
  Australian circus acts at the fringe, but this is one of the best.
  Contemporary circus isn’t just about the “ta-da!” moment: it likes to show its
  workings. It doesn’t present tricks as magic but as hard-won rewards for the
  effort involved. This show is an ode to the countless hours spent building the
  muscle, the reflexes and the precision skills that allow you to make your
  living flying through the air. It’s also a portrait of a group of friends
  having a good time. The camaraderie of the crew bounces off the stage as they
  set themselves challenges and games, starting fairly simply and quickly
  building difficulty. They do it with a light touch – there’s a good bit with a
  trick shot of throwing a water bottle and getting it to land upright. Then, of
  course, the troupe casually do the same thing with people, with the same
  bursting sense of delight. Bodies fly from one human tower to another, spring
  directly from the floor up on to someone’s shoulders, or jump into handstands
  (backwards, forwards, over the width of six people lying on the floor,
  balanced on someone else’s hands). There’s some serious gymnastics going on
  here; they’re flipping all over the flipping place. By showing the audience
  different versions and slowly ramping up the difficulty, we start to notice
  the details – whether the acrobats in a three-man tower are holding on to each
  other or not, for example – things that might otherwise pass by in a blur.
  Complicated set pieces are deftly choreographed with impeccable timing. But
  there’s also plenty of quirky personality, such as in a scene where they miaow
  like cats, or when performer Shani Stephens takes amusing suggestions from the
  audience in an improv bit, inventing an impromptu floor routine in the style
  of both a dinosaur and a drunk festivalgoer. The team’s achievements might
  seem superhuman but this is a show full of down-to-earth charm. • At Assembly
  Hall, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
