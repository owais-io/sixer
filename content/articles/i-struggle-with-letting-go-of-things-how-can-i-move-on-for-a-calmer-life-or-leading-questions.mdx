  I struggle with letting go of things. Distressing situations, that occurred 40
  years ago and more, still regularly pop into my mind and stress me out. I
  don’t seem to be able to move past them and forget them. Even small irrelevant
  things annoy me and get me worked up. How can I either forget them or stop
  them raising my blood pressure? I seem to continually be stressing about
  insignificant things that I can’t change anyway. Can you suggest some
  techniques to move on and lead a calmer life? Eleanor says: Since you said a
  lot of these are small or insignificant upon reflection, I’ll assume we’re not
  talking about big traumas, or the kinds of insults a person shouldn’t aspire
  to forget. I assume they’re the kinds of sour memories we all have: bad luck,
  bad slights. Being yanked backwards through time to those hurtful memories can
  be so unpleasant. Not just for us, but for the people around us; it can keep
  us psychically stuck in old distress, each new event seen as a trace outline
  of the past. So why do we keep going back? One possibility is that we feel not
  enough has changed. Time might have passed, but in the respects that matter,
  we still feel as though we’re right there. Still scared in the same ways those
  situations made us feel, still vulnerable to those same stressors, even
  uninsured against the same mistakes. If you feel as though a lot has changed
  since an indignity, either in you or in your circumstances, the memory feels
  more like a postcard from somewhere distant. But if you feel the same in the
  ways that matter, an upsetting thing from the past can still seem threatening
  insofar as that version of us persists today. Or maybe we go back to these
  memories because there’s some unanswered question we keep trying to solve. Why
  did I say that? Why did they do that? If I’d done that differently, would this
  have changed? Maybe, more rarely, we go back because we’re bored. Sometimes if
  present-day life doesn’t quite feel stimulating or agential enough we can go
  back to conflicts or hard choices from the past, because even though they were
  unpleasant, they somehow feel more real. Therapy can help figure out which it
  is for you. When the distressing thought comes knocking, why does it seem
  worth opening the door? That would really help you tailor your strategies. The
  calm you’ll need if you’re trying to solve a question may not be the calm you
  need if you still feel vulnerable in those same ways. Well-meaning people
  might say you need closure, a way to tell a coherent story. Closure is great
  if you can get it, but I’m not convinced it’s essential. My worry is that
  hunting for narratively satisfying ways to transmute bad memories ultimately
  ransoms our ability to move on to our ability to make sense of events.
  Coherence may be genuinely beyond our reach. Bad luck doesn’t make sense.
  People don’t always have a “why”, much less one we can accept as an
  explanation. Our trials are not always an Act 1 to which our later life can be
  the satisfying Act 3. I think – at least sometimes – it’s less “I have to get
  closure” and more “I have to see this as past; over”. On good advice, I once
  went back to some of my haunted places and saw how tall the trees had grown,
  how the buildings were gone. The world I kept going back to in my head quite
  literally does not exist. Other people write the bad things down and tear them
  up, have a little funeral, set them on fire (safely). As you try to figure out
  what is captivating about these memories, it might help to try seeing them in
  past tense too. Not solved, just over – not a source of new pain, not part of
  a pattern; an echo of hurts gone by. Ask Eleanor a question
