  Thailand tycoon who championed cannabis legalisation takes lead in race to be
  PM

  Tycoon-turned-politician Anutin Charnvirakul appears to have taken the lead in
  a chaotic race to become Thailand’s next prime minister, after days of tense
  negotiations. Anutin, who is leader of the conservative Bhumjaithai party and
  perhaps best known for championing medical cannabis legalisation, has received
  the backing of MPs from the main opposition party People’s party to form an
  interim government, provided he signs an agreement laid out by its leaders.
  The People’s party said its lawmakers would supply the votes needed for Anutin
  to become prime minister, as long as he agrees to dissolve parliament within
  four months and commits to changing Thailand’s constitution, possibly through
  holding a referendum – a step the People’s party hopes will make the country’s
  system more democratic. The People’s party will not join his government. The
  Bhumjaithai party is due to hold a press conference later on Wednesday
  morning. Thailand’s politics was thrown into chaos last week when the
  constitutional court removed former prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from
  office, saying she had violated ethical rules during her handling of a border
  dispute. Paetongtarn, the daughter of the billionaire former leader Thaksin
  Shinawatra, had been in office for only a year. Thailand’s constitutional
  court has frequently intervened in politics, dissolving popular parties and
  banning leaders. Separately on Wednesday, Pheu Thai, the party of the
  embattled Shinawatras, told local media it had submitted a request to the king
  for parliament to be dissolved, paving the way for elections. However, it was
  unclear whether lawmakers in the current caretaker government have the
  authority to do so, or how quickly this could happen. A vote for a new prime
  minister could be held in parliament as early as Friday. The People’s party
  has emerged as kingmaker in the recent negotiations, and both Bhumjaithai and
  the Pheu Thai party had raced to secure its support. The People’s party has
  played a deciding role in which party can form a government, because it has
  the largest number of seats in parliament, 143, having won the most votes at
  the last election in 2023. It cannot attempt to lead a government itself
  because its prime ministerial candidate was banned from politics in a court
  ruling last year. The court also dissolved the party’s previous iteration,
  known as Move Forward, over its promise to reform the country’s strict lese
  majesty law, under which criticism of the monarchy can lead to up to 15 years
  in prison. The People’s party has little love for either Bhumjaithai, a
  conservative party that does not share its pro-reform ideals, or Pheu Thai,
  which was perceived as blocking it from taking power in the past. People’s
  party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut said: “Both of these parties have track
  records, as everyone knows, of not exercising their power in the interests of
  the people and the country’s benefit.” But he added that his party had
  prioritised finding a way to bring about a new election and changes to the
  constitution. “I think everyone can see that this decision is not for our own
  popularity but it’s in the interest of finding a solution for the country.”
  Anutin, a royalist conservative whose family is a major shareholder in one of
  Thailand’s biggest construction companies, served as minister of public health
  during the pandemic. Until recently his party was in a coalition government
  with Pheu Thai, though it withdrew from government during the crisis that
  erupted over Paetongtarn’s handling of the border dispute with Cambodia.
  Wednesday’s announcement could prove a major blow to Thaksin, who has
  dominated Thai politics for decade but whose influence and popularity is now
  declining.
