  urban expansion

  Almost two decades ago, the Queensland historian Peter Spearritt issued a dire
  warning. If planning attitudes didn’t change, Brisbane would become “the 200
  kilometre city” – a giant conurbation, solid suburbs from Noosa to the New
  South Wales border, causing traffic chaos and dooming millions to a worse
  standard of living. “I don’t think many people realised just how dramatic
  continuing suburban sprawl would be,” he says. Queensland’s governments did
  put some legal limits on untrammelled expansion. But with the city facing an
  epic housing shortage, many planners are now concerned the new conservative
  state government will return to the city’s historic sprawl-or-nothing
  approach. The government has started test drilling on a proposed underground
  freeway designed to permit new suburbs in farmland west of Caboolture. At
  $14bn, the four-lane north-west transport corridor would be the most expensive
  road project in the city’s history. The first new suburb, Waraba, is set to
  boast 70,000 residents once complete. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Spearritt, now an emeritus professor of urban history at the University of
  Queensland, says legal limitations on sprawl are crucial for a city with few
  geographical barriers – unlike Sydney, Brisbane doesn’t have national parks on
  three of its four sides. “There were no green space barriers, and that makes
  it much easier to just basically develop former agricultural land forever,’ he
  says. ‘We are going to review every regional plan’ Brisbane has always been an
  unusually car-dependent and low-density city, even by Australian standards.
  There’s a simple reason for this: since 1885 Queensland has more or less
  banned townhouses and apartments. It worked. Just 11.3% of residents of the
  Brisbane local government area live in townhouses, which is even lower than
  the state average, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Ten times
  more people told the 2021 census they drove to work than took the bus or
  train. Locked out of the inner city, decades of newcomers have been forced
  into new communities in Logan, Ipswich, Moreton Bay and even further afield,
  swelling the populations of those outer areas by millions. In 2006 the state
  government stepped in, setting the first south-east Queensland regional plan.
  For the first time it established an “urban footprint” – a limited area where
  development is permitted. “It was a big political moment. I think it got
  fairly widespread support,” Spearritt says. “Was Brisbane actually thinking
  about how it would shape itself for the future? And I guess that sort of
  approach has been completely swamped by the rhetoric about the housing
  crisis.” As expansion slowed, the pace of inner-city development did not speed
  up. As a result, house prices and rents have skyrocketed, as development
  approvals head in the opposite direction. Under Labor, the state government
  used the regional plan to set density targets for councils – effectively
  requiring 60% of new homes to be apartments and townhouses. Now the Liberal
  National party planning minister, Jarrod Bleijie, has signalled radical change
  to the unpopular rule. “We are going to review every regional plan in
  Queensland and we are going to review them in consultation with local
  government,” he told parliament in March. “The time for state government
  acting like Big Brother over local government is over.” Asked last month if he
  would ditch the targets, he confirmed that there would be a move back to
  sprawl. “We need to look at the urban growth everywhere, across every regional
  plan, including the south-east Queensland regional plan,” he said. “The
  problem with the current south-east Queensland regional plan, the density is
  upwards, but developers are finding it incredibly difficult to afford to build
  vertical towers at the moment and to find buyers for them. So it’s no use
  putting in the regional plan to just go up, when the towers and housing is
  actually not being provided.” The government has also budgeted to spend $2bn
  subsidising council infrastructure to speed up development in new-build
  estates, including in regional Queensland. ‘No solution to the housing crisis’
  The Queensland Conservation Council (QCC) is one of many groups concerned that
  the city’s urban footprint boundaries might be expanded. Jen Basham, the
  council’s urban sustainability lead, says: “Further urban sprawl is not a
  solution to the housing crisis – it’s slower, more expensive and
  environmentally damaging.” A recent QCC report found the city could more than
  accommodate all new growth within its current boundaries – and that doing so
  would cost the taxpayer less and result in better social outcomes. New suburbs
  tend to be more car-dependent because there are few alternatives, the report
  says. That means greater emissions and many hours trapped behind the wheel for
  the residents. Sprawl also tends to cost more – an estimated $75,000 per
  dwelling in Sydney, according to the NSW Productivity Commission – due to the
  need to construct new infrastructure such as schools and hospitals. Instead,
  the OCC report concludes, Queensland should look to the long-banned “missing
  middle” housing typologies – townhouses and small apartments. Dorina Pojani,
  an associate professor of urban planning at the University of Queensland, says
  increasing density doesn’t have to mean tower blocks. “That’s a failure of the
  imagination,” she says. “What about the missing middle: row housing, four- to
  five-storey apartment complexes, co-housing, and so on? We need to move away
  from both the detached single-family and the tower typology. Zoning codes need
  be overhauled.” Travis Jordan, an organiser at Yimby (yes in my back yard)
  group Greater Brisbane, says there is another factor in favour of reform. The
  single-family house with a picket fence on 400 sq metres isn’t for everyone,
  he says. Some people want to live within walking distance of work, shops,
  schools and friends – and the law shouldn’t stop them. “Priorities change. The
  things we wanted to stop 40 years ago might be things we want to encourage
  now, and the kinds of homes our parents wanted might not be the ones our kids
  want to grow up in.” Jordan says other Australian cities are making better
  choices. The NSW and Victorian state governments have rolled out new rules
  limiting the power of councils to halt more sustainable development. Globally
  the real leader is New Zealand, he says. Since 2016, cities including Auckland
  have eliminated bans on apartments and townhouses, a policy that now has
  national support. Research has found that as a result, there has been a huge
  spike in construction and a resulting dip in rents. Jordan says it’s time for
  Brisbane to follow their lead. “For most of the last 20 years, ‘tall versus
  sprawl’ is all our planning schemes said you were allowed,” he says. “Instead
  of saying that’s too hard, the government should be standing up to the
  busybodies who want to tell everyone else what kind of homes they’re allowed
  to build on their land.” But Brisbane city council, the hemisphere’s largest
  and most powerful, flat out opposes missing middle development. It passed a
  new version of the century-old ban on townhouses in 2020. “Spreading the
  density right across every suburb of Brisbane is not the right answer,” the
  lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said at a candidates debate in the 2024
  election. In 2015, Spearritt announced that his warning had already come true.
  Brisbane had fused 200km of unending city. Ten years later, he doesn’t see
  much political will for reform. “I think it’s depressing that that there’s not
  more interest in the quality of community life and the quality of the urban
  environment. It’s almost as if people have sort of given up,” he says. “Maybe
  it’ll take another generation to realise – Jesus, this city is really getting
  awful.”
