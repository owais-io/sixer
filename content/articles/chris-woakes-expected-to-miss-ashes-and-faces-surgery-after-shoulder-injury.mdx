  Chris Woakes is expected to be ruled out of this winter’s Ashes tour and faces
  the possibility of surgery following the shoulder injury that has ruled him
  out of the remainder of the fifth Test against India. The 36-year-old suffered
  a dislocated left shoulder when diving to cut off a boundary late on the
  opening day at the Oval, tumbling over the rope and damaging the joint in the
  process. Scans overnight will be followed by further assessment in the coming
  days but the outlook is not positive. The fact the match is in progress means
  England have not officially confirmed the severity or exact nature of the
  injury but there is an expectation it will require an operation and a recovery
  period that runs into months. England land in Perth on 9 November. With Woakes
  having historically struggled for impact overseas in his career and averaged
  52 with the ball in this run-heavy series against India, there has been
  uncertainty as to whether he would be selected for the winter. But England had
  been considering him a likely traveller due to his depth of experience in an
  otherwise raw group of seam bowlers. There has also been a recent trend of
  more bowler-friendly surfaces in Australia which, along with a pink-ball Test
  in Brisbane, made him an option to be deployed tactically. In the short term
  the injury is understood to have devastated an England dressing room without
  captain Ben Stokes for the series decider with a shoulder issue. A two-time
  World Cup winner and Ashes player of the series in 2023, Woakes is among the
  most respected and popular members of the group – a wise head and a solid pro.
  Though a freak injury in one respect, it was in keeping with England’s mantra
  of chasing down every run. Woakes is not the first to get injured mid-Test
  this way since Brendon McCullum introduced it as a non-negotiable in 2022,
  with Jack Leach doing the same at Lord’s that summer. In the case of Leach it
  was concussion, which allowed for a substitute. One question is whether
  fatigue and heavy legs played a role in the incident. Woakes is the only
  member of England’s attack to play all five Tests in this series – likewise
  Mohammed Siraj for India – and bat dominated ball in the first four. A tally
  of 181 overs is his highest workload in a series. With Woakes among the
  England players whose central contract expires in October, and having
  specialised in red-ball cricket in recent years, there will inevitably be
  fears that a significant international career may be over. Much rests on the
  next few weeks and the establishment of a recovery plan. As regards Australia,
  the injury may open up a spot for Sam Cook, having been considered Woakes’
  new-ball understudy this season. Ollie Robinson’s record should in theory make
  him a contender here but the Sussex right-armer has not played for England
  since the 2024 tour of India when the management’s patience with his work
  ethic ran out.
