  Alleged killer Dezi Freeman may be hiding in one of hundreds of mine shafts
  sunk in the Porepunkah region over the last two centuries, which would prevent
  his heat signature being detected, one expert says. It’s been more than a week
  since Freeman fled into rugged bushland in the Victorian high country, and
  police are likely using helicopters and drones equipped with infrared imaging
  technology in the hunt for him. Locals and experts have speculated that he may
  be hiding down a mine shaft, or has an underground bunker. There are thousands
  of old mineshafts across Victoria. Horizontal tunnels called adits, made for
  drainage or access, provide ready-made caves. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  “We’ve found beds in there,” author and amateur goldfields historian Darby Lee
  says, adding that historically they have provided a warm, dry place for people
  with limited options. Freeman, who shares views with the “sovereign citizen”
  movement, vanished into the alpine wilds after allegedly shooting three police
  officers, killing two of them, in Porepunkah. Victoria Police chief
  commissioner, Mike Bush, says they believe the 56-year-old fugitive has “long
  arms, powerful firearms, multiple firearms”, and that Freeman’s bush knowledge
  is a challenge for them. “He knows that area. Even though we have experts in
  the area, he will know that area better than us, so we’re putting in every
  expert, supported by local knowledge as well,” Bush said. The Victorian Alps
  include the state’s highest mountains, multiple national parks and ski
  resorts. There are also rivers, dense bushland, vertiginous cliffs, and those
  mine shafts, which can act as booby traps. The police hunt – which includes
  the Special Operations Group, the fugitive squad, and the Critical Incident
  Response Team – has been hampered by the dangerous terrain, as well as bad
  weather. Lee, who also runs historic gold prospecting tours, has explored mine
  shafts in the area. “I’ve got a feeling he’s underground … a mine shaft, or a
  bunker. If they’re not getting pictures or heat signals, he’s underground.”
  Lee says that for every mine shaft registered, there’s another that’s not. And
  there’s a history of people camping out. “The old timers used to do it around
  Bendigo all the time, until the 60s and the 70s, when the councils got on to
  it,” he says. “We’ve found beds in there. It’s dry, it’s warm, and it might
  look a big gnarly but it’ll keep you out of trouble.” It’s not the first time
  police have been stymied by someone disappearing in the high country.
  Porepunkah is a couple of hours north of Wonnangatta Valley, where Russell
  Hill and Carol Clay went missing in 2020, before being found dead. Conrad
  Whitlock has been missing since 2019 – his car was found halfway up nearby
  Mount Buller. Hiker Niels Becker went missing on a solo hike in the national
  park in 2019. There are more. And it’s an area with a violent history. On the
  other side of Great Alpine Road is where the Buckland Riot happened in 1857.
  European miners attacked thousands of Chinese miners, killing dozens and
  driving thousands away. Heritage Victoria says there are likely more than 50
  graves at the site, covered in heavy vegetation. About an hour’s drive north
  west is Glenrowan, the site of Ned Kelly’s last stand after killing three
  policemen in the 1878 Stringybark Creek shootout. Survivalist and author Ky
  Furneaux said Freeman knows police will be looking for him on the ground with
  tracker dogs, and from the air with thermal imaging. She said in the alps, the
  first priority would be shelter. “In every survival scenario you’ll look at
  your location, your liabilities and assets,” she said. “At this time of year
  his biggest liability will be exposure to cold so he’ll need shelter first. If
  you’re lost in the alps you don’t worry about water, you’ll be OK.” She says
  if he’s a prepper, he’s likely to have an established setup in a bunker or a
  cave, a plan for “if the world went crazy”. “If they’re old-style peppers,
  they have it full of water, water filters, food supplies, stashes to get them
  through probably about three months … a cave maintains a temperature that’s
  livable all year round, and it’s heatable if it gets cold,” she said. On
  Monday, Victoria Police switched the focus of their investigations to call on
  people to reveal the gunman’s location. Supt Brett Kahan said people “know the
  whereabouts of the person who’s allegedly killed two cops” but have chosen not
  to come forward. “You are committing an extremely serious crime by harbouring
  or assisting in the escape of Dezi Freeman,” he said. Victoria Police declined
  to comment on the technology they are using, but have said they would use all
  resources at their disposal. The government has previously said that the
  police vehicle fleet provides “access to state-of-the-art camera and mapping
  systems, providing valuable intelligence and surveillance and better preparing
  them to respond to any emergency, rescue operation or threats of violence and
  terrorism” including infrared cameras. Terry Goldsworthy, associate professor
  in criminal justice and criminology at Bond University, said their available
  technology includes helicopters and drones, some with infrared imaging;
  armoured Bearcat vehicles that can travel off-road, are bullet resistant and
  blast resistant; and an ambulance helicopter. Michael Coates from C-Astral
  Aerospace Search and Rescue told the ABC helicopters would use optical
  cameras, infrared, and a thermal camera, that can see through vegetation, and
  filter out kangaroos and other animals. “The only way to really hide with a
  thermal camera is to get into a cave, or a big overhang … There’s goldmines in
  the area, you could drop down in one of them if it’s vertical or go in the
  side of the hill and that would allow you to evade detection as long as you
  stay there.” Heritage Victoria says there are thousands of mine shafts across
  Victoria, with hundreds sunk in the Buckland forest region near Porepunkah
  between 1853 – after the discovery of gold at Ballarat sparked the rush – and
  the early 20th century.
