  The weather is not the only thing putting a dampener on impromptu barbecues as
  consumers balk at the soaring cost of burgers, sausages and chicken to put on
  the grill. At nearly £4, a four-pack of supermarket own-label beef
  quarter-pounders costs 53%, or £1.37, more than this time last year, according
  to the price analysts Assosia. With steak and kebabs also off the menu because
  they are too pricey, Britons are switching to poultry. However, this extra
  demand is pushing up the price of chicken. A 600g pack of chicken thighs, for
  example, now costs £5.54. This is an increase of 64p, or 13%, on last year,
  based on the pre-promotion prices across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and
  Morrisons. Inflation has been mounting in the meat and poultry aisles since
  the turn of the year, which Andrew Keeble, the managing director and founder
  of Heck Sausages, described as a “perfect storm”. Chicken prices had risen in
  the past two years from £2.85 a kilo to £5.50, driven by a combination of
  avian flu and the industry drive to reduce the number of chickens in each shed
  on welfare grounds, he told the BBC. “We fully support it but you get fewer
  chickens in a shed [and] there aren’t enough sheds, to put it bluntly, and
  that is driving availability prices through the roof at the moment,” Keeble
  said. The pain doesn’t end at the patty cost for burger fans either, as the
  price of cheese slices and brioche buns has gone up, too, according to
  Assosia. Even the soft drink to wash it all down is more expensive because of
  soaring packaging costs, with polymer plastic prices more than doubling since
  November 2024. Drinks brands are also contending with the rising cost of sugar
  and fruit concentrates. According to the latest shop price monitor from the
  British Retail Consortium, food prices rose by 4% in July from a year earlier,
  up from 3.7% in June and above the three-month average of 3.5%. The BRC’s
  chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said households would have noticed their
  higher grocery bills after food price inflation rose for the sixth consecutive
  month. “Staples such as meat and tea were hit the hardest as wholesale prices
  for both categories have been hit by tighter global supplies,” she said. “This
  has helped push up overall shop prices.” The same pressures affecting the high
  street are pushing up the cost of food and drink in bars and restaurants, with
  another industry barometer, the CGA Prestige foodservice price index,
  recording a 2% month-on-month increase in June. This upswing in inflation was
  “yet another challenge to hospitality in the crucial summer months”, said
  Reuben Pullan, a senior insight consultant at CGA by NIQ. “Alongside labour
  cost rises of their own, and hesitant consumer spending, it puts some
  businesses under severe pressure and will force them to push menu prices up
  further,” he said.
