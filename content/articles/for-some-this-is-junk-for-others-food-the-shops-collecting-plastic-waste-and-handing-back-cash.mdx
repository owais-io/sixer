  When Mariama Kamara enters the new Statiegeld return shop on Nieuwezijds
  Voorburgwal, she is on a mission. She has been tasked by her aunt, who runs a
  nearby restaurant, with depositing three giant blue trash bags of bottles and
  cans. In about seven minutes she feeds the deposit machine about 350 cans,
  bringing in more than €50 (£43) which will go back into her aunt’s business.
  “It’s a really cool idea, and so convenient,” she says. In the Netherlands,
  whenever consumers buy goods in cans, glass or plastic bottles, they pay a
  slight fee (statiegeld) that ranges from 15 cents to 25 cents depending on the
  size and type. This money can be reclaimed, however, when you return the
  container to a “reverse vending machine”, while uncollected deposits go to
  enlarging the scheme. But the machines, which are usually located in grocery
  stores where they can catch foot traffic from customers, sometimes don’t work,
  or are not large enough. Stores will also only accept packaging from brands
  that they sell: for instance, Lidl won’t accept a Coca-Cola bottle because
  they don’t sell that brand there. And, unlike most of the other countries that
  have deposit return schemes, in the Netherlands there is no legal obligation
  for stores beyond supermarkets to have these machines. The Netherlands has an
  extremely ambitious national legal collection target set by the Dutch
  packaging management decree, which says that the beverage industry must
  recover at least 90% of all bottles and cans sold. The problem is it still has
  a long way to go. According to Verpact, 77% of all plastic beverage bottles
  and 84% of cans were returned last year – a high rate compared with many
  countries but still not high enough. So this year, Verpact is trying something
  new, launching shops that are solely for returning plastic bottles and cans
  (glass must be disposed of elsewhere). The first return store opened in May in
  Rotterdam, with a bulk machine that can process up to 200 bottles and cans at
  once and, according to Verpact, more than a million deposit packages have been
  handed in since then. Amsterdam now houses two Statiegeld stores and, because
  of their central locations, they have already brought in a lot of foot
  traffic. Users include those looking to dispose of waste, local businesses,
  intrigued tourists and people who spend entire evenings collecting cans and
  bottles. “For some people, it’s junk, for others, it’s something to eat,” said
  an employee from Kiepe Safety Group, the organisation tasked with staffing the
  stores. Deposit return schemes aren’t unique to the Netherlands. In 1970, the
  Canadian province of British Columbia introduced the first mandatory system to
  return beer and soft-drink cans and bottles. In 1984, Sweden created its own
  model, becoming the first in the European region to do so. The Netherlands has
  had a deposit return scheme for sometime: in 2006 they began accepting large
  plastic bottles and it has expanded over the years. Seventeen countries across
  Europe have systems in operation, including Norway, Germany and Ireland. And
  because of recent EU legislation that tasks member states with a 90%
  collection rate for single-use plastic bottles and cans, more countries are
  joining the pack. Hester Klein Lankhorst, the CEO of Verpact, sees this
  initiative as a way to help reach the ambitious national legal collection
  targets: “The goals we need to reach are really high and in a short time. We
  have to do it as quickly as possible.” Companies that release packaged
  products on the market are legally obliged to handle packaging collection and
  recycling, including the deposit system, says Verpact. It is the
  responsibility of the company, on behalf of the packaging industry, to report
  on an annual basis to the government. The containers collected are sorted,
  cleaned and then mainly processed into new raw material that can be sold back
  to manufacturing companies. According to Verpact, recycled PET (polyethylene
  terephthalate) is used in new PET bottles. In 2023, PET bottles already
  contained, on average, 44% recycled PET. The Netherlands also now requires
  that by 2025, 25% of the material of a PET bottle must be recycled material.
  Deposit return schemes are also seen as helping create a more circular economy
  and in some cases can help reduce litter. A study by the ministry of
  infrastructure and water management, the CE Delft consultancy and Utrecht
  University found that since the return shops opened (although they are not
  necessarily the only reason) the number of small plastic bottles and cans in
  litter decreased by 69%. But conversely, in some situations people who were
  gathering the bottles to raise money may empty out wastebins searching for
  them, making the litter situation worse. “In some cities, especially around
  garbage cans, there has been more litter, and it has incurred costs for cities
  that have to clean up that litter because they break cans, and then animals
  come in,” says Martin Calisto Friant of Circle Economy, an Amsterdam-based
  nonprofit. And the price of managing the technology and transport is
  significant. “It is quite an expensive system, but it really helps to lower
  the littering,” Lankhorst says. Finally, there are concerns over whether the
  financial returns – a key part of the incentive to recycle – are high enough.
  “There’s a low incentive, in my opinion, of a deposit value for small
  containers, and that I would say is one of the big weak points in the Dutch
  system,” says Thomas Morgenstern of Tomra, a Norwegian waste sorting company
  that supplies the reverse vending machines for many of the deposit return
  systems in the Netherlands. The low deposit doesn’t incentivise reduced
  consumption, which Calisto Friant sees as the main issue, while it’s also
  unclear whether these kinds of systems actually do anything to curb plastic
  production. “This could be a very important and useful kind of incentive to
  reduce consumption of single-use packaging, which is probably the most
  important thing we should do in the first place,” he says. The ideal, perhaps,
  say Lankhorst and Verpact, would be for every store to have recycling units
  that worked properly. But in the meantime, the Statiegeld shops are a good
  stopgap measure to continue to reduce litter and reach legal targets. “There’s
  not a silver bullet,” Lankhorst says. “But altogether we can make it more easy
  for people to get their deposit back and throw the cans and the bottles in the
  right way, in the right system.” And for Kamara, it’s more user-friendly.
  She’s used to going to one of three supermarkets and manually inserting
  bottles or cans one by one – an extremely tedious task. “If I had to manually
  do all the work, it would hurt my back,” she says. • This article was amended
