webTitle: Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre’s memoir to be published posthumously
sectionName: US news

bodyText: >-
  The posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most
  prominent accusers, will be published in the autumn, a publisher has
  announced. Giuffre had been working on Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving
  Abuse and Fighting for Justice, with the award-winning author and journalist
  Amy Wallace before her death earlier this year. The 400-page book will be
  released on 21 October, according to the Associated Press. Giuffre, who
  alleged she had been trafficked for sex to Prince Andrew, had completed the
  manuscript before she took her own life in April, the publisher Alfred A Knopf
  said. Prince Andrew has denied Giuffre’s allegations. In 2022, Giuffre and the
  prince reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual
  assault. Knopf’s statement includes an email Giuffre wrote to Wallace 25 days
  before her death, stating that it was her “heartfelt wish” the memoir be
  released “regardless” of her circumstances. “The content of this book is
  crucial, as it aims to shed light on the systemic failures that allow the
  trafficking of vulnerable individuals across borders,” the email reads. “It is
  imperative that the truth is understood and that the issues surrounding this
  topic are addressed, both for the sake of justice and awareness.” Giuffre had
  been hospitalised after a serious accident on 24 March, Knopf said, and sent
  the email on 1 April. She died on 25 April at her farm in Western Australia,
  where she had lived for several years. “In the event of my passing, I would
  like to ensure that Nobody’s Girl is still released. I believe it has the
  potential to impact many lives and foster necessary discussions about these
  grave injustices,” she wrote to Wallace. Knopf’s statement says the book
  contains “intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking new details about her time
  with Epstein, Maxwell and their many well-known friends, including Prince
  Andrew, about whom she speaks publicly for the first time since their
  out-of-court settlement in 2022.” Knopf editor-in-chief, Jordan Pavlin, said
  Nobody’s Girl was a “raw and shocking” journey and “the story of a fierce
  spirit struggling to break free”. In 2023, the New York Post reported that
  Giuffre had reached a deal “believed to be worth millions” with an undisclosed
  publisher. Knopf spokesperson Todd Doughty told AP that she initially agreed
  to a seven-figure contract with Penguin Press, but moved with acquiring editor
  Emily Cunningham after she was hired by Knopf as executive editor last year.
  Doughty declined to provide further details about the Epstein associates
  featured in Nobody’s Girl, but confirmed that Giuffre made “no allegations of
  abuse against [Donald] Trump”, who continues to face questions about the
  disgraced financier and his former friend. Nobody’s Girl is distinct from
  Giuffre’s unpublished memoir The Billionaire’s Playboy Club, referenced in
  previous court filings and unsealed in 2019. Through Doughty, Wallace says she
  began working with Giuffre on a new memoir in spring 2021. “Nobody’s Girl was
  both vigorously fact-checked and legally vetted,” a Knopf statement reads.
  Giuffre’s co-author on her memoir, Wallace, is an award-winning magazine and
  newspaper reporter whose work has appeared in the New York Times and the Los
  Angeles Times, among other publications. A representative for Andrew did not
  immediately return the AP’s request for comment. Buckingham Palace was asked
  for comment. Additional reporting by the Associated Press In the UK and
