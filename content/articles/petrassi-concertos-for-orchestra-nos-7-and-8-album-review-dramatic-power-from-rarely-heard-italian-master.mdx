  Petrassi: Concertos for Orchestra Nos 7 & 8 album review – dramatic power from
  rarely heard Italian master

  Though his music is rarely heard in the UK these days, Goffredo Petrassi was
  one of the most significant and influential Italian composers of the mid 20th
  century. Born in 1904, just a few months after Luigi Dallapiccola, Petrassi’s
  early works were firmly neoclassical, but after 1945 he began to incorporate
  elements from his younger contemporaries in the European avant garde. He was
  also a distinguished teacher; among the many who studied with him were Ennio
  Morricone, Peter Maxwell Davies and Cornelius Cardew. Petrassi’s eight
  concertos for orchestra are at the core of his orchestral output, and Naxos
  has now released recordings of all of them. The pairing of the last two,
  composed in 1964 and 1972, are typical of his later music, trenchantly argued,
  with fierce contrasts between strings and wind. It’s music of great resource
  and dramatic potency, even when the musical ideas themselves are not
  especially memorable. The performances from the Orchestra Sinfonica di Roma
  under Francesco La Vecchia feel utterly secure, and as a bonus they add the
  Sonata da Camera, for harpsichord and 10 instruments, which Petrassi composed
  in 1948. Stream it on Apple Music (above) or on Spotify
