  Today’s best bits … Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected
  by Newcastle and have let it be known they do not intend to submit a second
  offer for the striker in this transfer window. Hmmm … Tottenham Hotspur have
  brought the tough-tackling former Fulham midfielder Joao Palhinha in on loan
  from Bayern Munich in a deal that includes an option to make the move
  permanent for £27m. Spur have also sent their teenage winger Mikey Moore to
  Rangers on a season-long loan. Championship newcomers Wrexham have signed
  veteran centre-back Conor Coady from Leicester City in a deal believed to be
  worth around £2m. The culture secretary Lisa Nandy has urged National League
  club Morecambe to “do the decent thing” and sell the club to the Panjab
  Warriors consortium as a matter of urgency before the 105-year-old club goes
  out of business. It has been revealed that the Ineos Grenadiers head carer who
  left the Tour de France earlier this month after it was revealed he had been
  called to interview by the International Testing Agency (ITA) over alleged
  links to the convicted German doping doctor, Mark Schmidt, worked for
  Manchester United in 2024. And this season’s EFL gets under way this evening
  when Luton Town host AFC Wimbledon at Kenilworth Road in the first match of
  the season. Mikey Moore: Tottenham Hotspur’s highly regarded young winger has
  gone on a season-long loan to Ibrox, where head coach Russell Martin has said
  the teenager could play a crucial role in making Rangers successful again. “It
  was a reason why I got a job at Swansea from MK Dons, for sure, developing
  young players, and then a big reason why I got a job at Southampton as well,”
  he said. “We enjoy working with young players, enjoy playing a part in their
  development and I think we can help Mikey, but most importantly he can help us
  win on the pitch. “We’re not here to just have other teams develop football
  players. We’re here to win and he can help us do that. And if we can win when
  developing people and players as well, then that’s the ultimate goal. It’s a
  brilliant signing for the club. It’ll be good for us and good for Spurs,
  hopefully to help his development. It’ll be good for Mikey. “So I think it’s a
  really good move for everyone and I think he’ll definitely add to us as a big
  option on the pitch and in the forward line. He can play in a few positions
  and he’s a super-talented boy, so we’re excited to have him. I think age is
  irrelevant really. If you’re good enough, you’re old enough and I certainly
  think he’s good enough to impact games for us and help us win games of
  football.” Moore’s move to Glasgow is subject to international clearance and
  due to his age, may take more time than usual. He is unlikely to feature in
  his new side’s Scottish Premiership opener against Motherwell at Fir Park on
  Saturday. Football Daily: The latest thrilling instalment of our all-singing,
  all-dancing daily football email is here for your perusal. If you’re not
  already a subscriber, where have you been? Morecambe: I mentioned earlier that
  the culture secretary Lisa Nandy has called on Jason Whittingham to sell
  Morecambe Football Club in order to avoid the “heartbreaking” closure of the
  105-year-old institution within days. Here is the full and increasingly sad
  story from Josh Halliday, or North of England Editor.… Alexander Isak: It’s
  now being reported that having had their initial lowball offer for Alexander
  Isak rejected out of hand, Liverpool have said they have no plans to make
  another bid. I believe them but thousands wouldn’t and Andy Hunter has the
  latest … Alexander Isak: A quick scan of social media reveals that various
  self-styled In The Know experts who are linked to reputable news outlets,
  disreputable news outlets, or not linked to any media outlets but simply
  posting from their fetid bedrooms seem increrasingly at odds about what is
  going to happen next in the Alexander Isak-to-Liverpool saga. I’m not sure who
  their sources are, or if said sources even exist but they all seem to be
  “hearing” and “understanding” hiugely disparate things which are being lapped
  up by their respective audiences. It’s all nonsense, of course, but if I was
  as certain of just one thing as all those people claim to be about everything,
  I’d be a very content man. EFL: The Football League hamster wheels starts
  spinning for another season tonight at Kenilworth Road, where fan-owned League
  One sides Luton Town and AFC Wimbledon will get the new campaign under way.
  Luton Town are favourites to win the title after suffering back-to-back
  relegations, while AFC Wimbledon are many people’s tips to struggle after
  winning promotion through the playoffs following a three-year absence from the
  third tier. Morecambe: Morecambe owner Jason Whittingham has been urged to “do
  the right thing” and sell the club by Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, who
  clearly isn’t familiar with the work of a man who was happy to run Worcester
  Warriors rugby club into the ground and out of existence. The Shrimps, who
  were relegated to the National League at the end of last season, are at risk
  of closure amid a financial crisis. Nandy, who as the local MP for Wigan was
  involved in the club’s two fights for survival in recent years, has written to
  Morecambe’s owner urging him to act and has described the club’s plight as
  heartbreaking. “It is the Government’s firm view that owners need to act as
  custodians of their clubs,” Nandy said. “It is never too late to do the right
  thing and with so much at stake for this grand old town, the time for action
  is now. I call on you to effect a sale to a suitable owner, and give the club
  a chance for a brighter future.” The club were suspended by the National
  League on Monday because of their financial problems, a decision which means
  their first three National League matches of the season have been postponed
  and one that will be reviewed on August 20. The Panjab Warriors sports
  investment group insists it is ready to take over the club, and earlier this
  week it issued a statement alongside fans’ group the Shrimps Trust and local
  MP Liz Collinge, stating that all first-team operations had stopped after
  insurance cover at the club lapsed. Joao Palhinha: A case in point on the
  subject of high profile transfers that don’t necessarily work out – Joao
  Palhinha is a fine, tough-tackling midfielder who made it clear in no
  uncertain terms over two seasons, albeit without kicking up a fuss, that he
  wished to leave Fulham for Bayern Munich. He eventually got his wish last
  summer but failed to make much of an impression at the Allianz Arena during an
  injury-interrupted campaign. Now clearly surplus to Vincent Kompany’s
  requirements, the Portuguese has moved to Topttenham Hotspur on loan. An
  email: “There seems to be a lot of talk about how Liverpool will get Ekitike
  and Isak into the same team,” writes Bob Coyne. “People seem to be forgetting
  that we’ve sold Diaz and lost Jota (RIP) and so far only brought in Ekitike.
  So we’re a man down and I expect Nunez to also leave (along with Chiesa who
  doesn’t really count as he never played). It’s also interesting that Florian
  Wirtz is listed as a forward on the LFC website, not a midfielder.” Of course
  it is also worth factoring in the fact – and it is a fact –that getting
  polayers in is only half the battle and over a third of all football transfers
  don’t work out for one reason or another. Players often fail to settle and
  deliver, and they get injured (with reasonable frequency in the case of Isak)
  and suspended. While Liverpool don’t tend to sign too many duds, given the
  number of matches they’ll have to play next season I wouldn’t worry about how
  best to crowbar various players into the starting XI of each one. Alexander
  Isak: It is Keith to whom the Sky Sports News anchor throws and he reminds
  viewers of the background to Liverpool’s bid, the details of Isak’s
  self-imposed exile to Real Sociedad’s training ground and the details of the
  £120m package proposed by Liverpool earlier today. A proposal that was
  rejected out of hand by Newcastle. “As it stands Alexander Isak remains a
  Newcastle United player but we understand that Liverpool are set to come in
  with a second offer and they are very keen to get tyheir man,” says Keith.
  Good afternoon everyone. Have I missed anything? Sky Sports News certainly
  haven’t and have just announced they’ll be off to St James’ Park in a moment,
  where I’m guessing the intrepid Keith Downie will be standing outside,
  microphone-in-hand to let us know what he knows about Liverpool’s bid for
  Alexander Isak in his reassuring Scottish brogue. Will he be able to reassure
  Newcastle fans that Liverpool aren’t going to be able to prise the striker
  away from St James’ Park for anything less than the £150m most Geordies seem
  to their club should be paid for the Swedish striker? We’ll find out in due
  course. That’s all from me today. Barry Glendenning is here to take you
  through the rest of the evening’s news. Thank you for all your emails and
  happy Friday! Remember you can track all the latest men’s and women’s
  transfers with our interactives. Wrexham have confirmed the signing of Conor
  Coady from Leicester. It was earlier reported that a £2m fee was agreed
  between the two clubs. The Liverpool-born defender adds vital experience to
  the Championship new boys with 485 professional league appearances, 198 coming
  in the Premier League. Rangers were also interested in signing the
  32-year-old. I’m over the moon. It’s a special day, I’ll be honest. We’ve all
  seen what the club has done over the past few years and for me to join is
  really special and I can’t wait to meet the boys and get started. I have also
  got more emails on Clive Allen (see 13.29 BST and final entry in 14.23 BST).
  The forward signed for Arsenal in 1980, becoming the first £1m teenager in
  English football, played three pre-season matches and was sold to Crystal
  Palace in a swap deal with Kenny Sansom 62 days later. Allen told Arsenal he
  had wanted to stay after hearing the rumours before Palace’s Terry Venables
  talked Allen around. According to his 2019 autobiography Up front he was never
  given a clear cut reason as to what happened though the book does offer some
  theories: The QPR chair Jim Gregory would not sell Allen to his former
  employee in Venables so player was transferred through Arsenal. Palace were
  broke and could only do business via player trades. A football mystery … one I
  doubt will repeat itself with Hugo Ekitike. Some more of your thoughts on the
  Isak to Liverpool saga™. Justin thinks Liverpool should have other concerns:
  Writing is on the wall for Isak. Player power rarely fails in such a scenario
  and he has made his stance clear. Difficult for Newcastle with the current
  market and minimal options for a striker. Howe and co should be looking at
  Mateta for a solid Prem proven striker rather than chasing the likes of Sesko.
  I’m sure Slot will manage to give all his new look forward line playing time
  due to their positional flexibility. Overriding concern for me is the other
  end of the pitch. Three centre backs two of which, Gomez and Konate, are
  frequently injured. The latter has a year left on his deal. The back four was
  solid last season and now has to reset with new full backs. Consistency and
  depth is required and we’ve been in desperate need of a new centre back for a
  while now. I don’t understand why Quansah was sold. Overtures towards Guehi
  seem to have gone quiet at the mo. Flashbacks to the injury crisis and dubuous
  Hendo/ Fabinho centreback partnership the year after we last won the league.
  Having Endo and Gravenberch as cover isn’t a plausible plan and there is no
  Nat Phillip’s to save the season should injuries bite! Peter on the advantages
  of top clubs: So much for all the accusations of Newcastle having loads of
  (Saudi) money. Looks like Liverpool are offering to double his current wages,
  and we can’t match them. The positive spin being put on a sale is that it
  allows strengthening of the squad – in the same way that Liverpool did when
  they sold Coutinho (as mentioned in the Guardian a few days ago). However,
  Liverpool also came unstuck when they sold Torres to Chelsea and with the
  current management this seems the more likely outcome. We’ve missed out on
  Trafford and four or five others, and apparently Man City want Liveramento
  (and I can see his head now being turned). There have clearly been club (as
  opposed to team) management issues for a couple of years now, as evidenced by
  the mess we were in with FFP a year ago, and the current Isak fiasco. Everton
  are pursuing a deal for Tyler Dibling but are well below Southampton’s current
  valuation. A number of Premier League clubs have tracked Dibling’s progress
  and Everton have seen an initial approach in the region of £27m rejected by
  the Championship club. The Toffees are reportedly ready to make another move
  for the England Under-21s international but Saints want in excess of £40m for
  the academy graduate. Everton’s well-documented bid could spark moves from
  other clubs. Dibling has previously been linked to Tottenham, RB Leipzig and
  Chelsea, where he previously spent a short spell in the academy. West Ham,
  Aston Villa and Fulham are others reportedly interested in a player who is
  understood to have admirers at Manchester United. PA Media RB Leipzig will use
  the fee Liverpool paid for Hugo Ekitike as a benchmark for their valuation of
  Benjamin Sesko this summer according to reports in Germany. Ekitike moved to
  the Premier League champions in a £79m deal. Manchester United and Newcastle
  are both interested in the Slovenian striker. Everyone is still on a Euro 2025
  high after England’s historic triumph. But it’s never too early to look
  towards the future. Up next: World Cup 2027. Who will replace Lucy Bronze at
  right-back? Who are the Lionesses’ biggest challengers? Tom Garry has the
  answers. London City Lionesses announce the signing of Elena Linari. The
  defender has made 115 appearances for the Italian national team. In Italy,
  Linari has picked up the Serie A title on five occasions (twice with Brescia,
  once with Fiorentina and twice with Roma) and won the Coppa Italia six times
  (twice with Brescia, Fiorentina and Roma). She was the only Italian to be
  named in Uefa’s team of Euro 2025. Real Madrid are facing a conundrum on who
  to keep as backup to Kylian Mbappé according to reports in Spain. The club
  want to keep either Endrick or Gonzalo García – not both. Endrick does not
  want to go out on loan but the 19-year-old struggled in his first season at
  the Bernabéu last term, starting just three league matches. García also wants
  to stay this season after he finished as top scorer at the Club World Cup with
  four goals and one assist. I posed some questions (13:04 BST) and you have
  some answers! Michael on Newcastle’s strategy this window: There is a lot of
  questions to be asked about Newcastle’s nonexistent transfer business.
  Basically we’ve tried to eat at the top table, but no one wants to give us any
  food, no matter what we offer for it. Not helped by the fact that the top
  echelon have either resigned, left due to illness or got poached. We basically
  don’t have the PSR resources or turnover to match the top 4 or 5 clubs on that
  front in the EPL. That’s the brutal truth. So Isak going isn’t the worst thing
  in the world so long as we get two or three in return at around the £60/70m
  mark. I think the manager et al. have known he would go for weeks now and
  hopefully have been preparing for this. I think now the ball has been lobbed
  into court, there will be a bit of grandstanding and Isak will go for ~ £135m
  including these now commonplace “add-ons”. He’s great when he plays well, but
  does seem to be made of glass sometimes and then takes 4 to 5 games to get
  back into contention. But he gave us our first trophy in a lifetime for which
  he should be eternally thanked and we all move on. For those unaware Newcastle
  are operating without an official sporting director. Paul Mitchell left the
  club mutual consent at the end of June 2025 after less than a year in the
  post. Ben on Isak’s relationship with the supporters: As a Newcastle fan, it’s
  disappointing that it’s come to this, and Isak has definitely gone about it
  badly in a way that will probably sour his relationship with a significant
  portion of the fanbase, who have shown him so much adulation since he arrived.
  He was well on his way to legend status, if not there already after scoring
  the eventual winning goal against (ironically) Liverpool in the cup final only
  a few months ago. He could have tried to get his move while still going on the
  club’s tour even if he hadn’t played under the guise of injury, but this level
  of petulance is disappointing when he’s previously been a model pro. For what
  it’s worth I don’t think there’s much point keeping him against his will
  especially if there’s a record fee being put on the table, provided of course
  we could actually get a replacement in as our striker options if Isak goes
  comprise of 21-year-old William Osula. That said, with how things have gone in
  this window so far I’m not sure I trust our hierarchy to replace him, nor to
  be able to invest the rest of the funds raised by his sale in strengthening
  the rest of the squad. This was meant to be the summer we could finally spend
  after three windows of nothing, not to mention needing to avoid the issues we
  had with our thin squad last time we were in the Champions League, so to have
  only signed Elanga so far is bordering on negligent! And Kimos: Re Mathijs’s
  post (13:29 BST): Clive Allen moved from QPR to Arsenal in 1980 and then on to
  Crystal Palace without playing a competitive game. I would seriously doubt
  that is what Liverpool have in mind with regard to Ekitike and Isak.
  Sunderland have announced the signing of the 22-year-old goalkeeper Robin
  Roefs, subject to international clearance. Roefs arrives from the Dutch side
  NEC Nijmegen for an undisclosed fee and signs a five-year contract for the
  Black Cats. Prior to arriving on Wearside, Roefs enjoyed a breakout season in
  the Eredivisie last season keeping 10 clean sheets in 32 appearances, the
  second-most in the division. It feels really good to have signed for
  Sunderland. Joining such a big club with a rich history is a proud moment for
  me, and I’m excited for the challenge ahead in the Premier League. Last season
  was my first real experience as a senior goalkeeper, and I was happy with how
  it went, especially with the stats at the end of the campaign. He will be the
  16th Dutch goalkeeper to play in the Premier League. Edwin Van Der Sar was a
  big name in our country and also in England. Last year, you had Bart
  Verbruggen who has done a really good job at Brighton for his age. He’s the No
  1 goalkeeper for the Netherlands too. Tottenham have been informed that
  Heung-min Son and Los Angeles FC are in ongoing negotiations, according to
  reports. Son’s move to the MLS has been widely reported this summer. West Ham
  have signed Yu Endo on a two-year contract. The full-back’s arrival from the
  Japanese top-flight side Urawa Reds brings an end to her 15-year association
  with the club, having progressed through their youth ranks to become a
  mainstay in the side, featuring in every league game during her last two
  seasons. Endo won eight trophies in five years with her former side, including
  back-to-back league and AFC Women’s Champions League titles. Endo’s arrival to
  the WSL ups the Japanese international count in the league to 13. John Duerden
  wrote how British men’s clubs are turning to markets in Asia – especially
  Japan – to sign players and clearly that trend is in the women’s game too.
  Mathijs writes in: Could Liverpool legally offer Ekitike in a swap deal for
  Isak with Newcastle? Or is there a rule that any new signing has to have
  played a certain number of games for their new club before they can be
  sold/swapped? I am not sure there is a specific rule especially since we have
  seen players leave clubs without registering a single minute but it would feel
  like a huge waste of time and quite insulting to Ekitike if Liverpool were to
  sell him weeks after they signed him. The club officially announced his squad
  number today and the player has said Slot has a vision for him. It is clear,
  in an ideal world, Liverpool see both Isak and Ekitike as part of their plans.
  Aberdeen have sold Pape Habib Gueye to the Turkish Super Lig side Kasimpasa
  for what they described as “a significant undisclosed fee”. The 25-year-old
  Senegal striker moved to Pittodrie in August 2023 from Belgian club KV
  Kortrijk. After going out on loan to Norwegian outfit Kristiansund Ballklubb
  in the second half of his first season at Aberdeen, Gueye returned to the
  Granite City last summer and scored 12 goals last term before coming on in the
  second half of the cup final triumph over Celtic in May. “We wish Pape all the
  very best with his transfer to Turkey, and we thank him for his contributions
  during his time at Aberdeen, notably his positive impact in the Scottish Cup
  final,” said manager Jimmy Thelin. “We’re pleased with our recruitment so far
  this summer and the work remains ongoing to bring in further reinforcements
  and improvements ahead of the window closing. We are still shaping the squad.
  “We thank Pape for his efforts and wish him all the best with the next chapter
  in his career.” PA Media Is there any way Newcastle can persuade Isak to give
  them one more season? It was reported on Friday the club suggested penning new
  deal with a get-out clause for next summer but the player was not interested.
  Nottingham Forest have made an initial bid for the Southampton midfielder
  Mateus Fernandes. The Portuguese under-21 international was a shining light in
  a desperate Premier League season for the Saints after signing from Sporting a
  year ago. Fernandes made 36 league appearances for Saints in their relegation
  campaign but his performances attracted interest from rivals. West Ham are
  also believed to be keen on the 21-year-old who cost Southampton £15m. Forest
  are eager to add a central midfielder, recently bidding for Manchester City’s
  James McAtee but saw an offer worth up to £25m turned down. Southampton have
  already received a bid for Tyler Dibling for Everton, rejecting an opening
  offer in the region of £27m. The winger was the subject of interest from the
  Bundesliga at the start of the window but nothing came of it. Everton are
  understood to be plotting to make an improved bid for the teenager, who is
  valued at around £40m. Sterling shift as always, Will. Hello all. That bid,
  though expected, is huge news. Will be interesting to see how all parties –
  Newcastle, Liverpool and Isak – react. I want to hear your thoughts. Will
  Newcastle let him leave if Liverpool come in with an improved bid? Can Arne
  Slot keep everyone in his forward line happy if Isak walks through the doors?
  Should questions be asked about Newcastle’s business this window? Send me an
  email. What a an hour that was. Yara is back to pick up the pieces. Enjoy your
  weekend. It is understandable that Newcastle do not want to sell Isak,
  especially as their only other senior striker is Will Osula. There is one
  slight issue, however, mainly in the form that Isak is currently training
  alone in Spain. Will he return to the fold once the club’s tour to Asia
  concludes and be ready to go for the start of the season? In the meantime …
  why not try your hand at our quiz of the week? That should liven up the rest
  of the afternoon, while you tuck in your sandwiches. Something to discuss at
  the water cooler. Liverpool have seen their opening offer for Alexander Isak
  turned down by Newcastle. It is thought a £120m bid was made by the Premier
  League champions but Newcastle will hold out for more. Their situation is
  complicated by the fact they would first need to find a replacement for Isak.
  Can Morecambe be saved? Josh Halliday has been speaking to fans about the
  grave situation they find themselves in. “Great windows for Liverpool and
  Arsenal so far and they both finished above Man City last season,” writes Phil
  Grey. “I’m guessing this will be the first season a Pep club won’t start the
  season as favourites to win the league (and the other domestic trophies) since
  his first season as a manager at Barcelona in 2008.” I think Liverpool start
  as favourites. City have done plenty of business over the past seven months
  and you always back Guardiola to have something up his sleeve. City will be an
  interesting watch either way. The absolutely prolific Ben Fisher has been down
  to Newport for a chat with their new gaffer David Hughes about his first EFL
  job. Also a lovely mention of the new away kit, which is a stunner. More than
  £22m in Covid-related loans from the Scottish government to football clubs
  remained outstanding at the end of the last financial year, it has been
  revealed following a Guardian freedom of information request on the eve of a
  new Scottish Premiership season. I think the most interesting League One game
  of the weekend will take place at Edgeley Park, where Stockport are hosting
  Bolton. The Hatters have enjoyed another successful summer in the market, even
  if they have lost Isaac Olaofe, although the money recouped on him shows they
  are smart operators in the market. Nathan Lowe looks a smart signing on loan,
  while Joseph Olowu is an excellent centre-back. Two power hours on the trot
  from Yara and I. It is high-intensity stuff, going in short bursts like Jofra
  Archer, causing chaos and danger in equal measure. Will Unwin is back to bring
  you the latest for the next hour. Hopefully I lived up to expectations.
  Brentford have not dropped their interest in Ipswich’s Omari Hutchinson,
  according to reports. Last month the west London club’s £35m bid was rejected.
  The fee matched the winger’s relegation release clause but did not include
  enough cash up front. The relegation clause has since expired. Brentford’s
  club-record fee spent was the £30m the spent on Igor Thiago from Club Brugge
  last year. Some early lunchtime listening, perhaps? In our latest episode of
  Football Weekly Extra Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Sanny
  Rudravajhala and George Elek to preview the return of league football this
  weekend. Plus after almost two years since Football Weekly’s last live show,
  they are making a return for one night only to Troxy in east London on 11
  September. All the information and tickets (both in-person and for the
  livestream) can be found here. Rhian Brewster becomes Derby’s eighth signing
  of the summer, the 25-year-old joining the club on a two-year contract after
  leaving Sheffield United. The striker was a regular for the Blades in the
  2024-25 season, with 42 appearances in all competitions. They finished third
  in the table and reached the playoff final at Wembley. Sven Ulreich, the
  Bayern Munich goalkeeper, has posted on his social media that his six-year-old
  son Len died a few weeks ago after a serious illness. The player thanked
  family, friends and Bayern for “their discretion and great support over the
  past few months” before asking the public to respect his family’s privacy
  during this time. The Guardian understands Leicester are hoping to complete
  the signing of the American midfielder Celeste Boureille. The 31-year-old left
  the French side Montpellier earlier this summer and has been a key target for
  the WSL side. More on that exclusive from Tom Garry as it comes. A different
  type of transfer news: Liverpool unveil their new home shirt after switch from
  Nike to Adidas. Some clubs and kit sponsors just seem to make sense this.
  Liverpool and Adidas just screams of nostalgia. The club wore kits by the
  German apparel brand from 1985 to 1996, and again from 2006 to 2012. The
  unveiling launch video brings back those legends of yesteryear alongside the
  current crop of men’s and women’s players. An update on João Palhinha:
  Tottenham have agreed to sign the midfielder on a season’s loan from Bayern
  Munich, with the deal for the Portugal international including an option to
  make his move permanent for £27m. It is understood that Spurs will pay a loan
  fee of £4.3m and will also cover the whole of Palhinha’s wages, with the
  30-year-old expected to complete his medical in the coming days. Palhinha has
  three years remaining on his current contract but is believed to have been
  keen to return to the Premier League after enjoying two successful seasons in
  west London. He only made six starts in the Bundesliga under manager Vincent
  Kompany. Ed Aarons with the latest. Thanks Will, will try my best. Some loan
  news for you. Chelsea’s Mamadou Sarr has joined RC Strasbourg on a season-long
  loan. The defender joined the London outfit from the Ligue 1 side in June and
  was included in their squad for the Club World Cup. He joins two other Chelsea
  players – Mike Penders and Kendry Paez – on loan at the Ligue 1 side.
  Manchester United have also sent Ethan Wheatley on loan at Northampton Town. I
  think we can all accept I’ve done an incredible for the opening 90 minutes of
  this blog. Can Yara El-Shaboury maintain this standard for the next hour?
  That’s for you to decide. It is not just the players primed for the new
  campaign after a brutal pre-season. Ben Fisher went to see the referees get
  put through their paces in Alicante. It’s good work if you can get it. Looking
  ahead to tonight’s season opener … I am interested to see how Lasse Nordås
  gets on at Luton. I joined a sinking ship in January, made more difficult
  arriving from Norway during their pre-season. Now he has had chance to
  acclimatise, he could be very important to Luton’s chancers of bouncing
  straight back. What a relief for Lucas Paqueta that he can fully focus on
  playing football again and what must have been a difficult couple of years.
  Never a quiet day at Old Trafford. Sunderland have signed the highly-rated
  Dutch goalkeeper Robin Roefs from NEC Nijmegen. The 22-year-old has signed a
  five-year deal at the Stadium of Light, becoming the club’s eighth signing of
  a busy summer. “It feels really good to have signed for Sunderland,” Roefs
  said. “Joining such a big Club with a rich history is a proud moment for me,
  and I’m excited for the challenge ahead in the Premier League. Last season was
  my first real experience as a senior goalkeeper, and I was happy with how it
  went, especially with the stats at the end of the campaign. To be part of this
  journey at a Club like Sunderland is really special, and I’m looking forward
  to the campaign ahead.” When you watch a lot of League One and League Two it
  is easy to forget quite how sensationally good all these players are. At one
  point every one of the them was the best somewhere – school, youth, academy,
  wherever. It is a weird situation where they are living the dream – being paid

  Tottenham player to feature in the Premier League at the age of 16 years and
  277 days. Moore, who has played for England youth sides up to Under-19 level,
  told the Ibrox club’s official website: “I’m excited to get going. “As soon as
  I heard Rangers were interested and wanted me to come, it was a massive
  opportunity for me. I’m excited to be here and hopefully I can show the fans
  and everyone what I can do. I’ve always loved Rangers as a club. My family

  to come here.” PA Media We have a couple of transfer stories knocking around
  from last night. Where is Alexander Isak? He has wandered off to San Sebastian
  to enjoy a bit of solo training, some pintxos and hopefully the odd glass of
  Txakoli. I appreciate he might want to leave but it is always fascinating how
  these players go about it. Arne Slot says Liverpool are always keen on signing
  top quality players and there aren’y many – if any – better strikers than Isak
  around. It also helps that he really wants to move to Anfield. We might as
  well start in the traditional way with our League One and Two previews for the

Today’s best bits … Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle and have let it be known they do not intend to submit a second offer for the striker in this transfer window. Hmmm … Tottenham Hotspur have brought the tough-tackling former Fulham midfielder Joao Palhinha in on loan from Bayern Munich in a deal that includes an option to make the move permanent for £27m. Spur have also sent their teenage winger Mikey Moore to Rangers on a season-long loan. Championship newcomers Wrexham have signed veteran centre-back Conor Coady from Leicester City in a deal believed to be worth around £2m. The culture secretary Lisa Nandy has urged National League club Morecambe to “do the decent thing” and sell the club to the Panjab Warriors consortium as a matter of urgency before the 105-year-old club goes out of business. It has been revealed that the Ineos Grenadiers head carer who left the Tour de France earlier this month after it was revealed he had been called to interview by the International Testing Agency (ITA) over alleged links to the convicted German doping doctor, Mark Schmidt, worked for Manchester United in 2024. And this season’s EFL gets under way this evening when Luton Town host AFC Wimbledon at Kenilworth Road in the first match of the season. Mikey Moore: Tottenham Hotspur’s highly regarded young winger has gone on a season-long loan to Ibrox, where head coach Russell Martin has said the teenager could play a crucial role in making Rangers successful again. “It was a reason why I got a job at Swansea from MK Dons, for sure, developing young players, and then a big reason why I got a job at Southampton as well,” he said. “We enjoy working with young players, enjoy playing a part in their development and I think we can help Mikey, but most importantly he can help us win on the pitch. “We’re not here to just have other teams develop football players. We’re here to win and he can help us do that. And if we can win when developing people and players as well, then that’s the ultimate goal. It’s a brilliant signing for the club. It’ll be good for us and good for Spurs, hopefully to help his development. It’ll be good for Mikey. “So I think it’s a really good move for everyone and I think he’ll definitely add to us as a big option on the pitch and in the forward line. He can play in a few positions and he’s a super-talented boy, so we’re excited to have him. I think age is irrelevant really. If you’re good enough, you’re old enough and I certainly think he’s good enough to impact games for us and help us win games of football.” Moore’s move to Glasgow is subject to international clearance and due to his age, may take more time than usual. He is unlikely to feature in his new side’s Scottish Premiership opener against Motherwell at Fir Park on Saturday. Football Daily: The latest thrilling instalment of our all-singing, all-dancing daily football email is here for your perusal. If you’re not already a subscriber, where have you been? Morecambe: I mentioned earlier that the culture secretary Lisa Nandy has called on Jason Whittingham to sell Morecambe Football Club in order to avoid the “heartbreaking” closure of the 105-year-old institution within days. Here is the full and increasingly sad story from Josh Halliday, or North of England Editor.… Alexander Isak: It’s now being reported that having had their initial lowball offer for Alexander Isak rejected out of hand, Liverpool have said they have no plans to make another bid. I believe them but thousands wouldn’t and Andy Hunter has the latest … Alexander Isak: A quick scan of social media reveals that various self-styled In The Know experts who are linked to reputable news outlets, disreputable news outlets, or not linked to any media outlets but simply posting from their fetid bedrooms seem increrasingly at odds about what is going to happen next in the Alexander Isak-to-Liverpool saga. I’m not sure who their sources are, or if said sources even exist but they all seem to be “hearing” and “understanding” hiugely disparate things which are being lapped up by their respective audiences. It’s all nonsense, of course, but if I was as certain of just one thing as all those people claim to be about everything, I’d be a very content man. EFL: The Football League hamster wheels starts spinning for another season tonight at Kenilworth Road, where fan-owned League One sides Luton Town and AFC Wimbledon will get the new campaign under way. Luton Town are favourites to win the title after suffering back-to-back relegations, while AFC Wimbledon are many people’s tips to struggle after winning promotion through the playoffs following a three-year absence from the third tier. Morecambe: Morecambe owner Jason Whittingham has been urged to “do the right thing” and sell the club by Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, who clearly isn’t familiar with the work of a man who was happy to run Worcester Warriors rugby club into the ground and out of existence. The Shrimps, who were relegated to the National League at the end of last season, are at risk of closure amid a financial crisis. Nandy, who as the local MP for Wigan was involved in the club’s two fights for survival in recent years, has written to Morecambe’s owner urging him to act and has described the club’s plight as heartbreaking. “It is the Government’s firm view that owners need to act as custodians of their clubs,” Nandy said. “It is never too late to do the right thing and with so much at stake for this grand old town, the time for action is now. I call on you to effect a sale to a suitable owner, and give the club a chance for a brighter future.” The club were suspended by the National League on Monday because of their financial problems, a decision which means their first three National League matches of the season have been postponed and one that will be reviewed on August 20. The Panjab Warriors sports investment group insists it is ready to take over the club, and earlier this week it issued a statement alongside fans’ group the Shrimps Trust and local MP Liz Collinge, stating that all first-team operations had stopped after insurance cover at the club lapsed. Joao Palhinha: A case in point on the subject of high profile transfers that don’t necessarily work out – Joao Palhinha is a fine, tough-tackling midfielder who made it clear in no uncertain terms over two seasons, albeit without kicking up a fuss, that he wished to leave Fulham for Bayern Munich. He eventually got his wish last summer but failed to make much of an impression at the Allianz Arena during an injury-interrupted campaign. Now clearly surplus to Vincent Kompany’s requirements, the Portuguese has moved to Topttenham Hotspur on loan. An email: “There seems to be a lot of talk about how Liverpool will get Ekitike and Isak into the same team,” writes Bob Coyne. “People seem to be forgetting that we’ve sold Diaz and lost Jota (RIP) and so far only brought in Ekitike. So we’re a man down and I expect Nunez to also leave (along with Chiesa who doesn’t really count as he never played). It’s also interesting that Florian Wirtz is listed as a forward on the LFC website, not a midfielder.” Of course it is also worth factoring in the fact – and it is a fact –that getting polayers in is only half the battle and over a third of all football transfers don’t work out for one reason or another. Players often fail to settle and deliver, and they get injured (with reasonable frequency in the case of Isak) and suspended. While Liverpool don’t tend to sign too many duds, given the number of matches they’ll have to play next season I wouldn’t worry about how best to crowbar various players into the starting XI of each one. Alexander Isak: It is Keith to whom the Sky Sports News anchor throws and he reminds viewers of the background to Liverpool’s bid, the details of Isak’s self-imposed exile to Real Sociedad’s training ground and the details of the £120m package proposed by Liverpool earlier today. A proposal that was rejected out of hand by Newcastle. “As it stands Alexander Isak remains a Newcastle United player but we understand that Liverpool are set to come in with a second offer and they are very keen to get tyheir man,” says Keith. Good afternoon everyone. Have I missed anything? Sky Sports News certainly haven’t and have just announced they’ll be off to St James’ Park in a moment, where I’m guessing the intrepid Keith Downie will be standing outside, microphone-in-hand to let us know what he knows about Liverpool’s bid for Alexander Isak in his reassuring Scottish brogue. Will he be able to reassure Newcastle fans that Liverpool aren’t going to be able to prise the striker away from St James’ Park for anything less than the £150m most Geordies seem to their club should be paid for the Swedish striker? We’ll find out in due course. That’s all from me today. Barry Glendenning is here to take you through the rest of the evening’s news. Thank you for all your emails and happy Friday! Remember you can track all the latest men’s and women’s transfers with our interactives. Wrexham have confirmed the signing of Conor Coady from Leicester. It was earlier reported that a £2m fee was agreed between the two clubs. The Liverpool-born defender adds vital experience to the Championship new boys with 485 professional league appearances, 198 coming in the Premier League. Rangers were also interested in signing the 32-year-old. I’m over the moon. It’s a special day, I’ll be honest. We’ve all seen what the club has done over the past few years and for me to join is really special and I can’t wait to meet the boys and get started. I have also got more emails on Clive Allen (see 13.29 BST and final entry in 14.23 BST). The forward signed for Arsenal in 1980, becoming the first £1m teenager in English football, played three pre-season matches and was sold to Crystal Palace in a swap deal with Kenny Sansom 62 days later. Allen told Arsenal he had wanted to stay after hearing the rumours before Palace’s Terry Venables talked Allen around. According to his 2019 autobiography Up front he was never given a clear cut reason as to what happened though the book does offer some theories: The QPR chair Jim Gregory would not sell Allen to his former employee in Venables so player was transferred through Arsenal. Palace were broke and could only do business via player trades. A football mystery … one I doubt will repeat itself with Hugo Ekitike. Some more of your thoughts on the Isak to Liverpool saga™. Justin thinks Liverpool should have other concerns: Writing is on the wall for Isak. Player power rarely fails in such a scenario and he has made his stance clear. Difficult for Newcastle with the current market and minimal options for a striker. Howe and co should be looking at Mateta for a solid Prem proven striker rather than chasing the likes of Sesko. I’m sure Slot will manage to give all his new look forward line playing time due to their positional flexibility. Overriding concern for me is the other end of the pitch. Three centre backs two of which, Gomez and Konate, are frequently injured. The latter has a year left on his deal. The back four was solid last season and now has to reset with new full backs. Consistency and depth is required and we’ve been in desperate need of a new centre back for a while now. I don’t understand why Quansah was sold. Overtures towards Guehi seem to have gone quiet at the mo. Flashbacks to the injury crisis and dubuous Hendo/ Fabinho centreback partnership the year after we last won the league. Having Endo and Gravenberch as cover isn’t a plausible plan and there is no Nat Phillip’s to save the season should injuries bite! Peter on the advantages of top clubs: So much for all the accusations of Newcastle having loads of (Saudi) money. Looks like Liverpool are offering to double his current wages, and we can’t match them. The positive spin being put on a sale is that it allows strengthening of the squad – in the same way that Liverpool did when they sold Coutinho (as mentioned in the Guardian a few days ago). However, Liverpool also came unstuck when they sold Torres to Chelsea and with the current management this seems the more likely outcome. We’ve missed out on Trafford and four or five others, and apparently Man City want Liveramento (and I can see his head now being turned). There have clearly been club (as opposed to team) management issues for a couple of years now, as evidenced by the mess we were in with FFP a year ago, and the current Isak fiasco. Everton are pursuing a deal for Tyler Dibling but are well below Southampton’s current valuation. A number of Premier League clubs have tracked Dibling’s progress and Everton have seen an initial approach in the region of £27m rejected by the Championship club. The Toffees are reportedly ready to make another move for the England Under-21s international but Saints want in excess of £40m for the academy graduate. Everton’s well-documented bid could spark moves from other clubs. Dibling has previously been linked to Tottenham, RB Leipzig and Chelsea, where he previously spent a short spell in the academy. West Ham, Aston Villa and Fulham are others reportedly interested in a player who is understood to have admirers at Manchester United. PA Media RB Leipzig will use the fee Liverpool paid for Hugo Ekitike as a benchmark for their valuation of Benjamin Sesko this summer according to reports in Germany. Ekitike moved to the Premier League champions in a £79m deal. Manchester United and Newcastle are both interested in the Slovenian striker. Everyone is still on a Euro 2025 high after England’s historic triumph. But it’s never too early to look towards the future. Up next: World Cup 2027. Who will replace Lucy Bronze at right-back? Who are the Lionesses’ biggest challengers? Tom Garry has the answers. London City Lionesses announce the signing of Elena Linari. The defender has made 115 appearances for the Italian national team. In Italy, Linari has picked up the Serie A title on five occasions (twice with Brescia, once with Fiorentina and twice with Roma) and won the Coppa Italia six times (twice with Brescia, Fiorentina and Roma). She was the only Italian to be named in Uefa’s team of Euro 2025. Real Madrid are facing a conundrum on who to keep as backup to Kylian Mbappé according to reports in Spain. The club want to keep either Endrick or Gonzalo García – not both. Endrick does not want to go out on loan but the 19-year-old struggled in his first season at the Bernabéu last term, starting just three league matches. García also wants to stay this season after he finished as top scorer at the Club World Cup with four goals and one assist. I posed some questions (13:04 BST) and you have some answers! Michael on Newcastle’s strategy this window: There is a lot of questions to be asked about Newcastle’s nonexistent transfer business. Basically we’ve tried to eat at the top table, but no one wants to give us any food, no matter what we offer for it. Not helped by the fact that the top echelon have either resigned, left due to illness or got poached. We basically don’t have the PSR resources or turnover to match the top 4 or 5 clubs on that front in the EPL. That’s the brutal truth. So Isak going isn’t the worst thing in the world so long as we get two or three in return at around the £60/70m mark. I think the manager et al. have known he would go for weeks now and hopefully have been preparing for this. I think now the ball has been lobbed into court, there will be a bit of grandstanding and Isak will go for ~ £135m including these now commonplace “add-ons”. He’s great when he plays well, but does seem to be made of glass sometimes and then takes 4 to 5 games to get back into contention. But he gave us our first trophy in a lifetime for which he should be eternally thanked and we all move on. For those unaware Newcastle are operating without an official sporting director. Paul Mitchell left the club mutual consent at the end of June 2025 after less than a year in the post. Ben on Isak’s relationship with the supporters: As a Newcastle fan, it’s disappointing that it’s come to this, and Isak has definitely gone about it badly in a way that will probably sour his relationship with a significant portion of the fanbase, who have shown him so much adulation since he arrived. He was well on his way to legend status, if not there already after scoring the eventual winning goal against (ironically) Liverpool in the cup final only a few months ago. He could have tried to get his move while still going on the club’s tour even if he hadn’t played under the guise of injury, but this level of petulance is disappointing when he’s previously been a model pro. For what it’s worth I don’t think there’s much point keeping him against his will especially if there’s a record fee being put on the table, provided of course we could actually get a replacement in as our striker options if Isak goes comprise of 21-year-old William Osula. That said, with how things have gone in this window so far I’m not sure I trust our hierarchy to replace him, nor to be able to invest the rest of the funds raised by his sale in strengthening the rest of the squad. This was meant to be the summer we could finally spend after three windows of nothing, not to mention needing to avoid the issues we had with our thin squad last time we were in the Champions League, so to have only signed Elanga so far is bordering on negligent! And Kimos: Re Mathijs’s post (13:29 BST): Clive Allen moved from QPR to Arsenal in 1980 and then on to Crystal Palace without playing a competitive game. I would seriously doubt that is what Liverpool have in mind with regard to Ekitike and Isak. Sunderland have announced the signing of the 22-year-old goalkeeper Robin Roefs, subject to international clearance. Roefs arrives from the Dutch side NEC Nijmegen for an undisclosed fee and signs a five-year contract for the Black Cats. Prior to arriving on Wearside, Roefs enjoyed a breakout season in the Eredivisie last season keeping 10 clean sheets in 32 appearances, the second-most in the division. It feels really good to have signed for Sunderland. Joining such a big club with a rich history is a proud moment for me, and I’m excited for the challenge ahead in the Premier League. Last season was my first real experience as a senior goalkeeper, and I was happy with how it went, especially with the stats at the end of the campaign. He will be the 16th Dutch goalkeeper to play in the Premier League. Edwin Van Der Sar was a big name in our country and also in England. Last year, you had Bart Verbruggen who has done a really good job at Brighton for his age. He’s the No 1 goalkeeper for the Netherlands too. Tottenham have been informed that Heung-min Son and Los Angeles FC are in ongoing negotiations, according to reports. Son’s move to the MLS has been widely reported this summer. West Ham have signed Yu Endo on a two-year contract. The full-back’s arrival from the Japanese top-flight side Urawa Reds brings an end to her 15-year association with the club, having progressed through their youth ranks to become a mainstay in the side, featuring in every league game during her last two seasons. Endo won eight trophies in five years with her former side, including back-to-back league and AFC Women’s Champions League titles. Endo’s arrival to the WSL ups the Japanese international count in the league to 13. John Duerden wrote how British men’s clubs are turning to markets in Asia – especially Japan – to sign players and clearly that trend is in the women’s game too. Mathijs writes in: Could Liverpool legally offer Ekitike in a swap deal for Isak with Newcastle? Or is there a rule that any new signing has to have played a certain number of games for their new club before they can be sold/swapped? I am not sure there is a specific rule especially since we have seen players leave clubs without registering a single minute but it would feel like a huge waste of time and quite insulting to Ekitike if Liverpool were to sell him weeks after they signed him. The club officially announced his squad number today and the player has said Slot has a vision for him. It is clear, in an ideal world, Liverpool see both Isak and Ekitike as part of their plans. Aberdeen have sold Pape Habib Gueye to the Turkish Super Lig side Kasimpasa for what they described as “a significant undisclosed fee”. The 25-year-old Senegal striker moved to Pittodrie in August 2023 from Belgian club KV Kortrijk. After going out on loan to Norwegian outfit Kristiansund Ballklubb in the second half of his first season at Aberdeen, Gueye returned to the Granite City last summer and scored 12 goals last term before coming on in the second half of the cup final triumph over Celtic in May. “We wish Pape all the very best with his transfer to Turkey, and we thank him for his contributions during his time at Aberdeen, notably his positive impact in the Scottish Cup final,” said manager Jimmy Thelin. “We’re pleased with our recruitment so far this summer and the work remains ongoing to bring in further reinforcements and improvements ahead of the window closing. We are still shaping the squad. “We thank Pape for his efforts and wish him all the best with the next chapter in his career.” PA Media Is there any way Newcastle can persuade Isak to give them one more season? It was reported on Friday the club suggested penning new deal with a get-out clause for next summer but the player was not interested. Nottingham Forest have made an initial bid for the Southampton midfielder Mateus Fernandes. The Portuguese under-21 international was a shining light in a desperate Premier League season for the Saints after signing from Sporting a year ago. Fernandes made 36 league appearances for Saints in their relegation campaign but his performances attracted interest from rivals. West Ham are also believed to be keen on the 21-year-old who cost Southampton £15m. Forest are eager to add a central midfielder, recently bidding for Manchester City’s James McAtee but saw an offer worth up to £25m turned down. Southampton have already received a bid for Tyler Dibling for Everton, rejecting an opening offer in the region of £27m. The winger was the subject of interest from the Bundesliga at the start of the window but nothing came of it. Everton are understood to be plotting to make an improved bid for the teenager, who is valued at around £40m. Sterling shift as always, Will. Hello all. That bid, though expected, is huge news. Will be interesting to see how all parties – Newcastle, Liverpool and Isak – react. I want to hear your thoughts. Will Newcastle let him leave if Liverpool come in with an improved bid? Can Arne Slot keep everyone in his forward line happy if Isak walks through the doors? Should questions be asked about Newcastle’s business this window? Send me an email. What a an hour that was. Yara is back to pick up the pieces. Enjoy your weekend. It is understandable that Newcastle do not want to sell Isak, especially as their only other senior striker is Will Osula. There is one slight issue, however, mainly in the form that Isak is currently training alone in Spain. Will he return to the fold once the club’s tour to Asia concludes and be ready to go for the start of the season? In the meantime … why not try your hand at our quiz of the week? That should liven up the rest of the afternoon, while you tuck in your sandwiches. Something to discuss at the water cooler. Liverpool have seen their opening offer for Alexander Isak turned down by Newcastle. It is thought a £120m bid was made by the Premier League champions but Newcastle will hold out for more. Their situation is complicated by the fact they would first need to find a replacement for Isak. Can Morecambe be saved? Josh Halliday has been speaking to fans about the grave situation they find themselves in. “Great windows for Liverpool and Arsenal so far and they both finished above Man City last season,” writes Phil Grey. “I’m guessing this will be the first season a Pep club won’t start the season as favourites to win the league (and the other domestic trophies) since his first season as a manager at Barcelona in 2008.” I think Liverpool start as favourites. City have done plenty of business over the past seven months and you always back Guardiola to have something up his sleeve. City will be an interesting watch either way. The absolutely prolific Ben Fisher has been down to Newport for a chat with their new gaffer David Hughes about his first EFL job. Also a lovely mention of the new away kit, which is a stunner. More than £22m in Covid-related loans from the Scottish government to football clubs remained outstanding at the end of the last financial year, it has been revealed following a Guardian freedom of information request on the eve of a new Scottish Premiership season. I think the most interesting League One game of the weekend will take place at Edgeley Park, where Stockport are hosting Bolton. The Hatters have enjoyed another successful summer in the market, even if they have lost Isaac Olaofe, although the money recouped on him shows they are smart operators in the market. Nathan Lowe looks a smart signing on loan, while Joseph Olowu is an excellent centre-back. Two power hours on the trot from Yara and I. It is high-intensity stuff, going in short bursts like Jofra Archer, causing chaos and danger in equal measure. Will Unwin is back to bring you the latest for the next hour. Hopefully I lived up to expectations. Brentford have not dropped their interest in Ipswich’s Omari Hutchinson, according to reports. Last month the west London club’s £35m bid was rejected. The fee matched the winger’s relegation release clause but did not include enough cash up front. The relegation clause has since expired. Brentford’s club-record fee spent was the £30m the spent on Igor Thiago from Club Brugge last year. Some early lunchtime listening, perhaps? In our latest episode of Football Weekly Extra Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Sanny Rudravajhala and George Elek to preview the return of league football this weekend. Plus after almost two years since Football Weekly’s last live show, they are making a return for one night only to Troxy in east London on 11 September. All the information and tickets (both in-person and for the livestream) can be found here. Rhian Brewster becomes Derby’s eighth signing of the summer, the 25-year-old joining the club on a two-year contract after leaving Sheffield United. The striker was a regular for the Blades in the 2024-25 season, with 42 appearances in all competitions. They finished third in the table and reached the playoff final at Wembley. Sven Ulreich, the Bayern Munich goalkeeper, has posted on his social media that his six-year-old son Len died a few weeks ago after a serious illness. The player thanked family, friends and Bayern for “their discretion and great support over the past few months” before asking the public to respect his family’s privacy during this time. The Guardian understands Leicester are hoping to complete the signing of the American midfielder Celeste Boureille. The 31-year-old left the French side Montpellier earlier this summer and has been a key target for the WSL side. More on that exclusive from Tom Garry as it comes. A different type of transfer news: Liverpool unveil their new home shirt after switch from Nike to Adidas. Some clubs and kit sponsors just seem to make sense this. Liverpool and Adidas just screams of nostalgia. The club wore kits by the German apparel brand from 1985 to 1996, and again from 2006 to 2012. The unveiling launch video brings back those legends of yesteryear alongside the current crop of men’s and women’s players. An update on João Palhinha: Tottenham have agreed to sign the midfielder on a season’s loan from Bayern Munich, with the deal for the Portugal international including an option to make his move permanent for £27m. It is understood that Spurs will pay a loan fee of £4.3m and will also cover the whole of Palhinha’s wages, with the 30-year-old expected to complete his medical in the coming days. Palhinha has three years remaining on his current contract but is believed to have been keen to return to the Premier League after enjoying two successful seasons in west London. He only made six starts in the Bundesliga under manager Vincent Kompany. Ed Aarons with the latest. Thanks Will, will try my best. Some loan news for you. Chelsea’s Mamadou Sarr has joined RC Strasbourg on a season-long loan. The defender joined the London outfit from the Ligue 1 side in June and was included in their squad for the Club World Cup. He joins two other Chelsea players – Mike Penders and Kendry Paez – on loan at the Ligue 1 side. Manchester United have also sent Ethan Wheatley on loan at Northampton Town. I think we can all accept I’ve done an incredible for the opening 90 minutes of this blog. Can Yara El-Shaboury maintain this standard for the next hour? That’s for you to decide. It is not just the players primed for the new campaign after a brutal pre-season. Ben Fisher went to see the referees get put through their paces in Alicante. It’s good work if you can get it. Looking ahead to tonight’s season opener … I am interested to see how Lasse Nordås gets on at Luton. I joined a sinking ship in January, made more difficult arriving from Norway during their pre-season. Now he has had chance to acclimatise, he could be very important to Luton’s chancers of bouncing straight back. What a relief for Lucas Paqueta that he can fully focus on playing football again and what must have been a difficult couple of years. Never a quiet day at Old Trafford. Sunderland have signed the highly-rated Dutch goalkeeper Robin Roefs from NEC Nijmegen. The 22-year-old has signed a five-year deal at the Stadium of Light, becoming the club’s eighth signing of a busy summer. “It feels really good to have signed for Sunderland,” Roefs said. “Joining such a big Club with a rich history is a proud moment for me, and I’m excited for the challenge ahead in the Premier League. Last season was my first real experience as a senior goalkeeper, and I was happy with how it went, especially with the stats at the end of the campaign. To be part of this journey at a Club like Sunderland is really special, and I’m looking forward to the campaign ahead.” When you watch a lot of League One and League Two it is easy to forget quite how sensationally good all these players are. At one point every one of the them was the best somewhere – school, youth, academy, wherever. It is a weird situation where they are living the dream – being paid to play football – but constantly having to acknowledge they are not the best at this. Max Rushden on the joys of transfers as a lower league fan, as they desperately every new face is the saviour they never knew. Need more hot transfer gossip? Get stuck into today’s Rumour Mill. A further transfer nibble from me … Luton’s Lamine Fanne is wanted around Europe. Turkish side Konyaspor have already made contact with the Hatters about the Senegalese midfielder, who only moved to Kenilworth Road in January. Istanbul Basaksehir, Empoli and Copenhagen are also interested in the 21-year-old. Leyton Orient should confirm the loan signing of Manchester United’s Jack Moorhouse today. The player was at the club yesterday finalising the deal ahead of a season working with Richie Wellens. Orient had a cracking record with last season’s loan signings, so United will be hoping they can work their magic with the highly-talented Moorhouse. What happens when two superstars collide? Ben Fisher and Tom Brady in one article is about as good as it gets in the world of sport. Oh and Wayne Rooney gets further mention. A big day for him at Guardian HQ. Dominic Booth went down to Moss Rose to have a chat with John Rooney about his brother, not being Robbie Savage and the joys of the National League North. I was always quite excited to read that Franny Jeffers is the assistant manager. It looks like friend of Football Weekly Conor Coady is on his way to Wrexham from Leicester after the two clubs, reportedly, agreed a £2m fee for the former England centre-back. The Welsh club have enjoyed a good summer of mixing potential and experience in their transfer dealings. Mikey Moore spoke of his love for Rangers after joining the Ibrox club from Tottenham on a season-long loan. The highly-rated attacker, who turns 18 later this month, came through the ranks at Spurs and made his senior debut against Manchester City a little over 12 months ago, thus becoming the youngest Tottenham player to feature in the Premier League at the age of 16 years and 277 days. Moore, who has played for England youth sides up to Under-19 level, told the Ibrox club’s official website: “I’m excited to get going. “As soon as I heard Rangers were interested and wanted me to come, it was a massive opportunity for me. I’m excited to be here and hopefully I can show the fans and everyone what I can do. I’ve always loved Rangers as a club. My family have always loved them. “I think with the new boss and the way that we play, it’s a great place to be at the minute. It was a pretty easy decision for me to come here.” PA Media We have a couple of transfer stories knocking around from last night. Where is Alexander Isak? He has wandered off to San Sebastian to enjoy a bit of solo training, some pintxos and hopefully the odd glass of Txakoli. I appreciate he might want to leave but it is always fascinating how these players go about it. Arne Slot says Liverpool are always keen on signing top quality players and there aren’y many – if any – better strikers than Isak around. It also helps that he really wants to move to Anfield. We might as well start in the traditional way with our League One and Two previews for the upcoming season. The really good news is that I wrote them, so you can email in to tell me what utter nonsense I am spouting. I think, technically, I am still Harrogate Town’s fourth choice goalkeeper, so I know what I am on about. In the monied leagues, the focus is on Alexander Isak’s future. The Swedish striker is currently training alone at Real Sociedad as he looks to force a move away from Newcastle, with Liverpool his desired destination. Down the pyramid the action is on the pitch. Obviously football at no point stopped thanks to the Club World Cup, Women’s European Championship, European qualifiers, constant transfer rumours swirling and the general lack of anything else in our empty lives. League One gets us going with Luton v AFC Wimbledon later, which would have been a Premier League v League Two clash a couple of years ago. It shows that football can still be quite fun and unpredictable. We welcome all your comments, predictions and insight heading into this glorious time when the Football League is given centre stage.
