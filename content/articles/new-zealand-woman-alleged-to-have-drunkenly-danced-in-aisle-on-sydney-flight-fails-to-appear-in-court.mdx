  A New Zealand woman has failed to appear in court after being charged for
  alleged drunken behaviour on a scheduled international flight from Sydney,
  including dancing in the aisle before takeoff. Sheree Young, 50, was on a
  flight from Sydney to Queensland around 4pm on 21 July when she performed
  allegedly intoxicated behaviour, including ignoring safety instructions,
  swearing at cabin crew and dancing in the aisle as the pilot was taxiing for
  takeoff, the Australian federal police alleged. The pilot aborted takeoff,
  returned to the gate and requested AFP assistance to remove Young from the
  aircraft. The AFP alleged she was asked to exit the plane and became
  argumentative and non-compliant. Sign up: AU Breaking News email She was
  eventually removed from the plane by the AFP so the flight could depart and
  returned to New Zealand the following day after being released from police
  custody in Mascot, the AFP said. Young was given a court attendance notice for
  failure to comply with cabin crew’s safety instructions, carrying a maximum
  penalty of $16,500, and breaching the criminal code by resisting, obstructing,
  hindering or intimidating a commonwealth official, carrying a maximum penalty
  of two years’ imprisonment. The New Zealand citizen was due to appear at John
  Maddison Tower in Sydney on Wednesday for a mention hearing but did not appear
  in court. Her case was adjourned until 17 September after the judge decided
  against executing a warrant due to the case’s lack of severity. Her residence
  was listed in the rural Queensland town of Barcaldine however she was a
  citizen of New Zealand. AFP Det Acting Insp Trevor Robinson said the alleged
  actions inconvenienced everyone on board. “The alleged behaviour of this woman
  … in this case caused a delayed takeoff, which inconveniences everyone on
  board,” he said. “They are potentially ruining the travel plans of hundreds of
  other people.”
