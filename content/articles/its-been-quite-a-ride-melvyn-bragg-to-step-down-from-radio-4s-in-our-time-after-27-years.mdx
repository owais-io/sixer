  Melvyn Bragg has announced that he will be leaving BBC Radio 4 show In Our
  Time after hosting it for 27 years. He launched it in October 1998, after
  being asked to present a programme during what was known as “the death slot”
  because of its low Thursday morning audience figures. The show, which explores
  the characters, events and discoveries that have shaped our world, has proved
  extremely popular. It celebrated its 1,000th episode in 2023 and is regularly
  one of the BBC’s most listened to on-demand programmes worldwide. It was also
  the BBC’s first podcast, and – 20 years since its 2004 launch – one of BBC
  Sounds’ most popular podcasts among under-35s. To this day, Bragg is the only
  person to have presented the show. “For a programme with a wholly misleading
  title which started from scratch with a six-month contract, it’s been quite a
  ride,” said Bragg. “I have worked with many extremely talented and helpful
  people inside the BBC as well as some of the greatest academics around the
  world. It’s been a great privilege and pleasure. I much look forward to
  continuing to work for the BBC on Radio 4. Thank you for listening.” Bragg’s
  final episode aired in August, and was a discussion on political speeches
  based on the fourth-century BC speeches of the Athenian orator Demosthenes. In
  Our Time will continue with a new host, who is yet to be announced. “Melvyn’s
  passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity and his unwavering commitment
  to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the
  lives of millions,” said Tim Davie, the BBC director general. “Through In Our
  Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight and humanity to our airwaves
  every single week for more than a quarter of a century. He leaves behind not
  just an extraordinary body of work, but a gold standard of broadcasting and
  interviewing excellence that will inspire generations to come.” Radio 4 will
  mark the end of Bragg’s tenure as host of In Our Time by airing some of
  Bragg’s favourite episodes. It will also launch a curated selection of past
  shows on BBC Sounds chosen by notable fans of the show.
