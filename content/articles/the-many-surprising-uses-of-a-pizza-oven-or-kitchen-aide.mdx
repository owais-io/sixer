  I have just got a pizza oven, but what else can I cook in it? Sure, Neapolitan
  pizza and negroni nights are great, but start thinking of your pizza oven as a
  high-temperature furnace and there will be even more reason to stay outdoors.
  “I’d lean towards food that you eat charred,” says Naples-trained Kit Delamain
  of Circus Pizza at Panzer’s Deli in London. That might mean aubergines to
  blitz into baba ganoush, finishing meat (think lamb) that’s been cooked low
  and slow “to get that really nice, charred flavour”, or to bake pitta: “They
  puff up ever so nicely, which is hard to achieve in a normal oven.” The same
  goes for pillowy naan, adds Arun Tilak, executive chef at Dishoom: “Roll the
  dough into a round or oval shape, prick lightly with a fork and bake until
  beautifully golden. Brush with butter and you’re in for a treat.” Of course,
  pizza ovens come in different shapes and styles, but, depending on which you
  have, they can be “really controllable”, says Rachel Jones, founder of ACE
  Pizza in east London, who recently cooked a whole turbot in hers. “Start with
  that intense heat, which will blister the skin, before turning it down and
  leaving the fish to cook through.” That said, you could also have chicken
  tonight: “Spatchcock a chicken and marinate it in lemon zest, garlic, olive
  oil, rosemary and salt and pepper for at least an hour,” says Jones, who then
  pops the bird skin side up in a skillet and into the pizza oven on low,
  rotating occasionally, until cooked. “While the chicken rests, throw summer
  veg [courgettes, peppers, tomatoes] into the skillet with olive oil and
  garlic, and get that pan back in the oven.” Start the flame on high (“to get
  some nice char”), then turn to low and cook for another 15 minutes: “Serve
  with a squeeze of lemon, a scatter of fresh herbs, maybe a dollop of yoghurt
  and some flatbread on the side.” A pizza oven could facilitate curry night,
  too. “Cook chicken or vegetables in the pizza oven, then just add them to a
  homemade sauce,” Delamain suggests. Tilak, meanwhile, would think about
  charring carrots or crisping potatoes to toss with a punchy kebab masala and
  finish with a zippy lime and chilli dressing: “The intense heat cooks
  everything quickly and locks in the most amazing flavour.” His preferred dish,
  however, would be biryani: “Yes, even that works in a pizza oven: layer
  marinated chicken in the base of a pot, top it with partially cooked rice,
  then finish with a little cream, butter, fresh mint and coriander.” Seal with
  a lid and cook “on dum [AKA low and slow].” And if you fancy something sweet,
  flaky pastry is “at its best with the dry heat of a pizza oven,” says Tomas
  Topolar, head chef at Oxmoor Farm in the Chiltern Hills, who adds that pizza
  oven galettes are easier than, well, pie: “The sweetest blackberries are those
  that come off easily; they almost fall into your fingers. You then only need
  to add lemon juice, a dusting of flour and sprinkle of sugar to make a
  beautiful filling.” And remember that residual heat is also your friend, Jones
  says: “Slice stone fruit [peaches, plums or nectarines, say], put them in a
  cast-iron pan, drizzle with honey and add fresh thyme.” After about 20 minutes
  in the oven “they’ll be lovely and sticky”. Just add yoghurt and chopped nuts
  for happy days. Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com
