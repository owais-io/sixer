  So much for the British &amp; Irish Lions’ winner-takes-it-all ambitions. This
  was far from their finest hour and almost nothing went to plan on a filthy
  Sydney night. Instead, it was the Wallabies who concluded the series on a
  high, defying the wet conditions and a mid-game lightning storm delay to end
  visiting hopes of a 3-0 clean sweep. The Lions also had to contend with an
  increasingly savage injury toll, losing their captain, Maro Itoje, Tommy
  Freeman and James Ryan to failed head injury assessments before the teams were
  instructed to leave the field as a safety precaution. The score was 8-0 in the
  hosts’ favour when play was halted at 9.12pm local time and play was suspended
  for 38 minutes. A 61st-minute try from Jac Morgan did give the Lions the
  faintest glimmer of hope, but it was the Wallabies who came away as the damp
  but delighted victors courtesy of an early try from Dylan Pietsch and
  second-half scores from Max Jorgensen and Tate McDermott. Will Stuart’s
  last-gasp score for the Lions was the slimmest of consolations and the series
  proved a rather closer contest than seemed likely at half-time in the first
  Test in Brisbane. The Wallabies will now be kicking themselves afresh for
  allowing a 23-5 lead to slip away in Melbourne in the second Test. As well as
  handling the conditions better, Joe Schmidt’s side were tactically smarter and
  at barely any stage did the Lions look like achieving their first clean sweep
  on a multi-Test Lions tour since 1927. Their kicking game was mixed, their
  depleted lineout fell apart and Australia’s back-row ultimately had more
  dynamic energy with and without the ball. This was the second time in two
  weeks that a Test has been halted for lightning, with Australia-Wales women’s
  international in Brisbane having been similarly interrupted. The weather had
  been wild all day, turning the Manly ferry crossing into a rollercoaster ride
  and drenching spectators en route to the game. Australia, though, were not to
  be distracted from the task at hand and had a try on the board after seven
  minutes, a no-look pass from Joseph Aukuso-Suaalii giving the eager Pietsch
  the chance to dive into the left corner. As well as enjoying more territory
  and possession, the Wallabies were also looking to ruffle their opponents’
  composure, with both captains being instructed to control their players by the
  Georgia referee, Nika Amashukeli. The recalled Taniela Tupou was also enjoying
  some scrummaging success and the net result was a frustrating first half-hour
  for the visitors. When Fin Russell could not grasp a slippery ball and the
  Lions were again penalised at the ensuing scrum it summed up their problematic
  start. The outlook was about to get even worse. Itoje never leaves the pitch
  without good reason so his departure for a head injury assessment was a
  setback in itself. When he failed to return, it left Ollie Chessum to hold the
  fort alongside Ryan with Dan Sheehan taking over the captaincy. Australia were
  also forced into a reshuffle when Tom Lynagh, having stretched his side’s lead
  by a further three points, copped a heavy hit from Sheehan and also failed his
  HIA. The trek to the medical room was increasingly becoming a procession, with
  Freeman also disappearing never to return. The most wince-inducing blow of the
  lot, though, was the one suffered by Ryan, who stooped to tackle the massive
  Will Skelton and was rewarded with a knee to the head. Play was halted for a
  considerable period before Ryan was transferred to a medical cart and driven
  away. If the Lions were hoping the lightning break would alter the rhythm of
  the contest they were to be sadly mistaken. Twelve minutes after the restart,
  Owen Farrell and Blair Kinghorn sought to shovel the ball to the left wing,
  but it went to ground and the pacy Jorgensen, not for the first time in the
  series, showed his predatory qualities to beat the cover. Morgan’s consolation
  did at least ensure the Lions were not kept scoreless for the first time since
  1983, but a defiant Australia were not to be denied. There was also some
  encouraging off-field news for the host nation, with the Lions chief
  executive, Ben Calverley, informing a pre-game roomful of top officials and
  VIPs that the touring team would definitely be returning to Australia. The
  Wallabies can also now claim to have made some significant on-field progress
  since hitting rock bottom at the 2023 World Cup. Build on this morale-boosting
  result and they could yet be in half-decent shape by the time they host the
  next edition in 2027. First, though, they have back-to-back Tests in South
  Africa to negotiate this month, starting in Johannesburg on 16 August. A big
  loss, should one materialise, would clearly put the overall outcome of this
  series into perspective, but maybe it is now the Springboks who may need to be
  watchful. As for the Lions, this tour has at least further underscored the
  brand’s enduring appeal. While the average age of the sea of red at every Test
  continues to rise, edging out Australia in any kind of sporting series never
  grows old. This final stumble, though, was not an occasion they will remember
  with any great affection.
