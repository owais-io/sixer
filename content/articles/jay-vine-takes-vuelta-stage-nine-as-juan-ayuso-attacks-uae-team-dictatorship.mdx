  Jonas Vingegaard looked casual while he slipped back into the red jersey at
  the top of the Larra-Belagua but it was a dramatic day at the Vuelta a España
  for UAE Team Emirates as Jay Vine, the mountains classification leader, took
  the stage win after his teammate, Juan Ayuso, has earlier accused management
  of acting “like a dictatorship”. Vine took his second stage win, the fourth of
  the race for UAE, with a well-timed attack on the final climb to distance his
  final challenger left in the breakaway, Pablo Castrillo. The Australian had
  originally called off plans to go for a stage win earlier in the day as the
  peloton attacked the hilly route at pace – with average speeds regularly
  topping 49km per hour – but as the race unfolded an opportunity arose for Vine
  to bridge over to the day’s breakaway group and he took it. Lotto’s Alec
  Segaert later attacked from that pack of leaders at the 20km banner, but was
  caught and passed on the way up Larra-Belagua by the nine remaining riders. As
  the pretenders fell away on a 6.3% average gradient, Castrillo (Movistar) and
  Vine were left to battle it out. It always looked like Vine would have too
  much for Castrillo and so it proved when he powered away on a chicane with 5km
  to go. Vine’s victory put a positive slant on a day that began with tumultuous
  scenes at the start as Ayuso hit out at UAE management. The Spanish rider
  described their decision to send out a press release on Monday’s rest day –
  confirming that the 22-year-old would be ending his contract three years early
  – as “like a dictatorship and an exercise of power over me”. Ayuso told
  Spanish reporters: “We’d made an agreement that it would come out after the
  Vuelta was over, so it wouldn’t affect things in the team at all on a sporting
  level during the race and not to affect any of the riders. I think that it’s
  clear why they’ve done it, to try and harm my image again.” Ayuso had said
  riding for the team would be “pointless” after stage nine on Sunday, but put
  in a strong effort on the final climb as the UAE team leader, João Almeida,
  tried push the other general classification contenders out of their comfort
  zones. Almeida is now third overall, only 12 seconds behind Norway’s Torstein
  Træen (Bahrain-Victorious), who lost the overall lead to Vingegaard after
  falling off the back of the GC group with 6km to go. Tom Pidcock is only 20
  seconds behind Almeida – who told the Briton to “grow some balls” after a
  ding-dong ride on stage nine – with the Briton now fourth in the GC standings.
  Pidcock looked comfortable going up Larra-Belagua, maintaining the form he
  showed before Monday’s rest day. “I backed up my ride from the other day and
  the more I do that, the more confidence I’m going to have,” said the Q36.5 Pro
  Cycling team leader post-stage. The double Olympic mountain bike gold
  medallist confirmed that he had received an apology from Almeida over their
  angry ecxhange, saying: “I don’t take anything to heart, it was in the heat of
  the moment. I’ve also said stuff to people in the past, so there’s no hard
  feelings.” Pidcockhas yet to put together a genuine challenge for a grand tour
  title, but has previously performed strongly at the Tour de France, winning a
  stage in 2022. Asked about his form, he said: “I feel super good. After a
  performance like I did on Sunday it fills you with confidence. The more that
  happens the better I’ll feel.” Vingegaard described Pidcock as a “very strong”
  rival for the GC and the Dane appeared pleased with the low-key way he was
  able to retake the red jersey. With the media focus currently elsewhere in the
  peloton, the Visma-Lease a bike rider now faces a tough week of climbing,
  including the famous L’Angliru climb on stage 13, with a target on his back.
  “Basically every day this week is going to be a fight for GC,” Vingegaard said
  at the finish line. “You need to choose your days and then go for it. That’s
  what we did.”
