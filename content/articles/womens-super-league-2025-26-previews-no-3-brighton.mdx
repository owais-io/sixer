  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 5th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie
  Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 5th Prospects After securing an impressive fifth-placed finish in
  Dario Vidosic’s first season, Brighton look increasingly settled, with
  historical management troubles firmly behind them and a clear identity shining
  through. It was a season of learning for their head coach as the team got off
  to an impressive start, then experienced a dip before finishing relatively
  strongly. An eye-catching victory over Arsenal and valiant 2-2 draw with the
  champions, Chelsea, were highlights. They made Crawley’s Broadfield Stadium
  into a fortress, losing only two games there, and secured a club record 28
  points in a WSL season. There has continued to be considerable player turnover
  as Vidosic develops his side. Ten outgoings have included the loss of some
  considerable experience. The departures of the club captain, Vicky Losada, and
  the forward Pauline Bremer were perhaps the least surprising with game time
  limited but they have left a knowledge gap. The loss of the defensive pairing
  of Maria Thorisdóttir and Guro Bergsvand raised eyebrows, particularly in the
  case of the vice-captain Bergsvand, who started every game of the campaign.
  The real shock, however, came with the announcement that Nikita Parris, a key
  figure in Vidosic’s attack, had moved to London City Lionesses. Replacements
  have been found, however, and the transfer activity has been astute. The Japan
  defender Moeka Minami brings a wealth of knowledge while the signings of
  Maelys Mpomé and Colombia’s left-back Manuela Vanegas were shrewd. Chiamaka
  Nnadozie adds world-class quality in goal and the 20-year-old Spanish forward
  Carla Camacho is an exciting prospect. Persuading Michelle Agyemang to return
  for another loan will be regarded as a coup after the youngster’s summer with
  England. She is joined by her Arsenal teammate Rosa Kafaji, whose raw talent
  is clear but who is in desperate need of game time. Brighton have had a strong
  pre-season to date. After a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace, they departed for
  Spain, where they beat CF Alhama 2-1 before putting eight past Levante without
  reply. Hosting duties await on opening day as Aston Villa visit and Vidosic
  will regard it as a real opportunity to set down a marker. The manager
  Vidosic’s style became clear very early, his desire for his team to have the
  ball and attack with intent shining through. Brighton registered the
  fourth-highest average possession in the league last season (53.1%) and the
  second-highest shot conversion rate (19.1%). It was, however, a season of
  development for the former Australia international. Heavy defeats by Arsenal,
  Chelsea and Manchester United were a wakeup call regarding the need to develop
  defensive resilience, although injuries played a part. There is no doubt that
  important foundations have been set for the 38-year-old to build on. Off-field
  picture Brighton continue to receive impressive support behind the scenes.
  Their training facility remains one of the WSL’s best and the club continue to
  invest in the playing squad and staff and to develop their player pathway.
  News is expected soon about progress made on the ambition to build a stadium
  for the women’s team in Brighton. The council approved the plans in 2023 and
  Brighton’s chief executive, Paul Barber, has said the 2027-28 season is a
  realistic goal for it to be finished. Bringing the team back to Brighton is
  key if they are to continue building an invested fanbase. Star signing
  Nnadozie could go down as one of the acquisitions of the summer. The Nigeria
  international brings top quality after a summer to remember. She played an
  integral role in the Super Falcons’ 10th Africa Cup of Nations title in July
  and was named Wafcon’s best goalkeeper. She arrives after five successful
  years in France, where she helped Paris FC make their first appearance in the
  Champions League for a decade. She left after helping Paris to a Coupe de
  France victory over Paris Saint-Germain, with Nnadozie saving two penalties in
  the shootout. Stepping up Maisie Symonds appeared to have put battles with
  illness and injury behind her last season with a series of impressive displays
  for club and country. At 22, she is Brighton’s longest-serving player and will
  be looking to establish herself consistently at the heart of the team. A
  versatile midfielder, she can play as a No 6 or an 8 with her composure,
  technical ability and strength in a challenge. A series of standout
  performances for Brighton and England’s Under-23s earned a first Lionesses
  call-up in March. It was a good summer for … Agyemang was one of the emerging
  stars of the summer. The 19-year-old played an influential role from the bench
  at Euro 2025, scoring an equaliser for the Lionesses against Sweden and Italy
  in the quarter-final and semi-final respectively. Her performances earned her
  the Euro 2025 young player of the tournament award. It has been a meteoric
  rise for the forward, who went from earning her first senior cap in April,
  marked by an unforgettable strike, to becoming a European champion and
  household name less than four months later. She will be looking for more game
  time than she got last season as she continues her development on loan from
  Arsenal. Main initiative to attract more fans Brighton will continue to play
  most home matches in Crawley. Season tickets went on sale in May and included
  an invitation to an open training session, priority access to cup and away
  games and free coach travel to Broadfield Stadium. There is also a new
  season-ticket option for under-10s. The “atmosphere section” has been moved to
  the East Stand to maximise its impact.
