  Does that back-to-school feeling ever fade? As someone who spends an
  inordinate amount of time in stationery shops, I’d posit that no, it doesn’t.
  There’s just something about September that feels like a fresh start – whether
  that’s cracking the spine of a new notebook or jamming your feet into shoes
  without toe posts for the first time since May. Admittedly, going back to the
  office after a summer spent corralling children, drinking canned cocktails, or
  some chaotic combination of both is less thrilling than heading into a new
  class when you’re a kid. But it still brings that same mixture of trepidation
  (emails) and excitement (new shoes). Of course, you don’t have to buy new –
  and of course, if you don’t need a new bag or loafers, you don’t have to buy
  anything at all. But a wardrobe or stationery refresh can help you feel more
  prepared for whatever the new (school) year throws at you. So if you’re in
  need of some new-term bits and pieces (or hoping to refresh your existing
  ones), read on for our favourite back-to-the-grind buys for all ages. The
  perfect bring-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink bag? A planner that won’t prove
  completely useless come January? We’ve got you. *** Everything you need to get
  back to the grind *** Womenswear *** The back-to-school blouse Pleated blouse
  £75 at Arket There’s nothing like the promise of a new white shirt to lure you
  back to the office – let’s be honest, none of us are rushing back for the
  interminable commute and the terrible coffee machine. This waisted poplin
  shirt from Arket makes for the perfect low-maintenance outfit: just add jeans
  and a pair of flats, and call it a day. *** The ludicrously capacious bag
  Suede-top tote bag £130 at M&amp;S Every woman should have in her arsenal a
  ludicrously capacious bag – or at least, one big enough to fit a laptop and a
  lunchbox. This soft, suede tote from Marks &amp; Spencer is a serious upgrade
  to the greying canvas kind you probably lug your gymwear in. It holds its
  shape thanks to a structured base, the top handle sits comfortably on the
  shoulder, and it goes with just about every outfit imaginable. *** The
  wear-forever trench A-line trench jacket £159 at Arket I’ve been on the hunt
  for a good transitional jacket since last autumn, and I’m now convinced the
  best ones sell out by late summer. You don’t always have to buy new – see
  Vinted and charity shops for great trenches that you can have altered to fit
  just right – but my money’s on this short cotton jacket from Arket. It hangs
  beautifully, can be worn for both work and weekend plans, and is heavy enough
  to last into the winter when layered over knitwear. (Plus, it’s brown in a
  chic way, not in a “why is Dad wearing that?” sort of way.) *** Refresh your
  knitwear Sweater stone £13 at Toast If there’s one item on this list that’s
  truly indispensable, it’s this recycled glass sweater stone. Yes, it’s more
  primitive-looking than those £30+ electric fabric shavers, but it does just as
  good a job at depilling and reviving tired knitwear. I’ve used it to smooth
  bobbly merino wool and cashmere, and I’m positive it would work just as many
  wonders on school jumpers and cardies. *** The perfect pumps Split suede
  ballerinas £35.99 at Zara I recently sprained an ankle from walking too far in
  ballet flats, so you think I’d have learned my lesson. Yet here I am, pining
  for a new pair of back-to-work ballerinas to smarten up jeans and replace the
  hideous gorpcore sandals that have been glued to my feet all summer. What this
  suede Zara pair lack in arch support, they make up for in good looks. Dress
  them up with a pair of tailored trousers, or down with indigo denim. *** The
  goes-with-everything shirt Classic striped shirt £95 at With Nothing
  Underneath Generally, you want to avoid difficult decisions early in the
  morning – such as working out what to pair with a print. But stripes are an
  exception. A blue striped shirt will go with everything (except further prints
  – sorry!). I like the classic from With Nothing Underneath – it’s neat in the
  shoulders, has a round hem short enough to tuck, and washes like a dream. I
  bought mine on Vinted, so keep an eye out on resale sites for similar styles.
  *** Resole and repair If your loafers or ballet flats have seen better days,
  extend their life by getting them resoled. Timpson does a good resole service
  at a reasonable price (you can get that emergency key cut at the same time),
  while most local high streets will have a cobbler ready with repair advice.
  *** Add interest to an old bag Stay Sharp key fob £8 at Ark Colour Design
  Thanks to Labubus, the plush monster dolls that have inexplicably become a
  fashion sensation, joyful bag charms are getting their due. If a brand-new
  work bag is out of budget – or your current one is still going strong – a
  charm can add a bit of fresh interest. Cambridge-based Ark Colour Design make
  beautiful ones in every shape you can imagine, using leather that’s a
  byproduct of the meat and dairy industry. *** The bad-hair-day hack Oversized
  stripe hair scrunchie £14 at Anthropologie Enough time has passed since the
  great scrunchie resurrection for us all to agree that they’re no longer a
  passing fad. From couture iterations at Celine to the ubiquity of Ganni’s
  cotton leopard hair tie, the scrunchie is here to stay – which is good,
  because it’s the most useful accessory around. Throw unwashed hair into a low
  bun for the school run or rush to the station to style out a bad hair day.
  (Wear at the nape of your neck to avoid looking like an eight-year-old dance
  prodigy.) *** The slip-on-and-go shoes Gathered leather moccasin £89.99 at
  Mango Whether you’re pining for a pair of Clarks light-up trainers or black
  leather loafers in Mango, the thrill of new shoes for the new school year
  never goes away. And loafers really are a wardrobe staple: invest in a
  comfortable pair and you’ll make your money back tenfold. (I’m told that
  that’s what they call “girl maths”.) *** Iron out the kinks Russell Hobbs
  handheld clothes steamer £22 at John Lewis I begin every school year with the
  resolve to become the kind of woman who irons her clothes. But as I’m still
  waiting for this to happen, a quick go-over with a steamer in the morning has
  saved many an outfit from looking as if I slept in it. I’ve just bought the
  Russell Hobbs Steam Genie: it heats up almost instantly, does a good job of
  getting out creases, and is cheaper than most. *** Hair up, head down
  Hand-painted Big Apple claw hair clip £28.12 at Solar Eclipse A novelty hair
  clip isn’t exactly what you’d call a new-term essential, but you’ve got to
  admit: it is fun. Solar Eclipse’s hand-painted acetate hair claws are designed
  by an all-women team in New York, and are great for keeping fringes and stray
  hairs out of your eyes when it’s time to get down to some serious business.
  *** Menswear *** The smart shoe Suede derby shoes £169 at Cos Loafers can look
  a little Hooray Henry on men (although if that’s the look you’re going for, by
  all means crack on). Derby shoes are a much more stylish alternative – a good
  halfway house between casual and formal, without looking too city trader. This
  chunky suede pair from Cos can be worn with everything from denim to
  tailoring. (Invest in a leather protector to make them last.) *** Pull your
  socks up Cotton-rich socks, seven-pack £7 for a pack of seven pairs at M&amp;S
  To misquote Allen Ginsberg, I have watched some of the best outfits of my
  generation destroyed by a bad pair of socks. Yes, they should always match.
  No, the tops of them should not be visible when your trousers ride up. In
  terms of bang for your buck, this super-soft M&amp;S pack of seven is pretty
  much the best there is. *** Down to a T Ecru textured organic cotton T-shirt
  £45 at Wax Does the perfect white T-shirt exist? Well, the perfect ecru one
  does. There’s something about an off-white tee that looks that little bit more
  office-appropriate than blinding bright white (possibly because it’s less
  likely to go grey after a few too many washes). This boxy cotton T-shirt is
  cut from a textured heavy-weight cotton you can wear well into the autumn
  under an open shirt or jacket. *** Smarten up your knits Milano ribbed
  cardigan £39.90 at Uniqlo Some men’s cardigans can look a little X Factor
  circa 2010, but this collared Uniqlo knit has the structure of a jacket, and
  is smart enough to be worn as one, whether that’s over a poplin shirt or
  T-shirt (see above). Be warned: it’s hand-wash only, but like most knitwear, a
  decent spot clean every so often should do the trick. *** Stationery and
  accessories *** A pencil case for grownups Small sage pouch £16 at Community
  Clothing A pencil case, but for adults in denial about owning a pencil case.
  Made from dead stock cotton, this Community Clothing pouch would make a nice
  addition to any cavernous work bag – just add pens, keys, hand cream and any
  other miscellaneous bits that are always falling to the bottom. *** The high
  fashion lunch bag £19.95 at Black + Blum Carting around last night’s stir-fry
  never looked so stylish. More micro-accessory than lunch box, Black + Blum’s
  roll-top mini cooler is leakproof, light and considerably more chic than a
  balled-up bag for life. Given that metal hardware, I wouldn’t be surprised if
  people thought it was a handbag. *** The bring-it-all backpack £65 at Eastpak
  If you’re lugging heavier-duty fare, then a backpack is much more practical
  than a tote – staving off shoulder pain, and allowing you to pile in
  everything from a laptop to a gym kit. Eastpak’s medium roll-top bag is a good
  size: big enough to fit what you need; not so big as to look like you’re
  running away from home. *** Strawberry sleeves for ever Strawberry laptop
  sleeve £30 at Baggu I’m a big believer in double-bagging your laptop: that is,
  putting it in a case and putting it in the protective pocket of your backpack.
  (Mainly because I’ve learned the hard way how expensive they are to repair.)
  Made from recycled ripstop nylon, Baggu’s envelope-shaped sleeves make the
  dreaded Monday morning power-on just that little bit sweeter. *** The fancy
  pen Rollerball pen £12.99 for a pack of five at Ryman Granted, they’re more
  expensive than your bog-standard stationery cupboard pen, but these Uni-ball
  fine liners really are the best. Do always keep one of those ballpoint pens
  nearby, though, should a colleague ask to borrow a pen. *** The waste-free
  planner Undated week planner £14 at Asobi If your well-intentioned resolution
  to keep a 2025 diary has gone out the window (honestly, who has either plans
  or inclination to fill one in January?) go for an undated planner that lets
  you map out your week in a more slapdash way. Margate-based Studio Todd makes
  beautiful planners with dyslexia-friendly coloured paper and 52 blank weeks to
  fill at your leisure. *** The fancy notebook Classic notebook From £15.90 at
  Leuchtturm1917 When someone whips out one of these in the office, you know
  they mean business. Well, that or they’ve just had a birthday and a relative
  didn’t know what else to buy them. If you’re looking for a fancy notebook to
  kick off the (academic) year right, Leuchtturm1917 is pretty much the best it
  gets. Think sewn pages, a pocket at the back, a choice of hard or soft smooth
  covers (note: it’s not leather) and a wraparound elastic closure. FYI: if
  you’re feeling especially fancy, you can use a fountain pen on its pages and
  it won’t bleed through. *** The everyday notebook A4 notebooks £4.95 for a set
  of five at Muji Sadly, a £16-a-pop notebook habit is unsustainable – at least
  for me. These are the ones I use come October when the fancy notebook runs
  out. With 30 faint-lined pages in each A4 exercise book (they come in a pack
  of five) and minimal bleed-through, they’re a decent everyday option to keep
  in your bag should inspiration – or your line manager – strike. *** The
  throwback pencil case Storage container pen case £13.46 at London Graphic
  Centre This Japanese brand is the stuff of a stationery lover’s dreams. Is
  this hardshell pencil case the most practical item in this edit? Not quite. Is
  it big enough to fit a lip balm and a couple of pens while, crucially, being
  chic? You got it. *** Kids *** The big family planner Family week planner
  £8.99 at Butler and Hill To some indispensable, to others tyrannical, the rise
  of the big family planner shows no sign of abating. And why should it? It’s a
  useful way of mapping out the week ahead while keeping hold of your sanity.
  This wipe-clean version from Butler and Hill will help you keep track of any
  after-school and evening commitments, without wasting reams of paper. *** The
  distinctive lunch bag Pack a Lunch bag £13.50 at Frugi If you want to make
  sure you see your kid’s lunch bag again, get a distinctive one with a label.
  Aside from being adorable, this rainbow lunch bag from Frugi has an insulated
  foil lining, and a small front pocket for snack storing. *** The raincoat
  Shower Resistant Mac £20 at Sainsbury’s It’s September, which most likely
  means that your child will cycle through four seasons in one school day. This
  gender-neutral mac is shower-proof but light enough to run amok in. *** The
  best budget water bottle Kids’ stainless steel water bottle £14.99 at Ion8
  There’s nothing like a fancy bottle to incentivise your kid to drink water.
  The adult version of Ion8’s stainless-steel water bottle was chosen by the
  Filter as the best budget bottle around (no small feat, given we tested 42 of
  them). The kids’ version is no different: leak-proof, dishwasher safe and
  small enough to slot into their school bag without weighing them down. *** The
  double-zip pencil case £10.19 at Small Kins If you’re a parent, chances are
  you’ve already been shepherded through Smiggle, getting the full disquisition
  on which pencil case and why, and who is likely to have the same one, and what
  this all means in the scheme of classroom politics. If not, though, this
  embroidered Forest Friends pencil case from Little Dutch has two handy
  compartments and is made from sustainable – and durable – material. (NB: if a
  new pencil case isn’t on the agenda – or in the budget – use a nail brush and
  some warm soapy water on last year’s, before laying it flat to dry.)
