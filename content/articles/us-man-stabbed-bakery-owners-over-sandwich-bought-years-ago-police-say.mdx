  A knife-wielding man recently slashed and stabbed two bakery owners because
  they gave him the wrong sandwich four years earlier, authorities in New Jersey
  said. Brothers Abed and Mohammed Assad were attacked at their store in
  Paterson on 31 July after the disgruntled customer complained that the
  sandwich they served him made him ill, according to Moneer Simrin, a friend of
  the victims. Simrin told WABC TV that the assailant launched into a tirade at
  Mohammed Assad over being given an eggplant sandwich instead of the egg
  sandwich he ordered four years ago. “He told him, ‘You give me eggplant in my
  sandwich and then my stomach was bothering me’ and stuff like that,” he said.
  “They told him: ‘OK, we’ll give you the money, we’ll give you credit, whatever
  you want,’ but he start[ed] cursing. They try to tell him, ‘OK, just get out,
  please, get out from the store,’ and he pulled a knife.” The man then
  allegedly stabbed Mohammed in the chest, and slashed Abed on his arm when he
  stepped in to help his brother. The victims were taken to a local hospital
  with non-life threatening injuries. Witnesses heard screaming from inside the
  bakery and saw one of the victims outside clutching his bloody arm, according
  to the local news outlet Pix11.com. “What happened surprised everyone because
  they are very nice people,” the witness, a worker in an adjacent building,
  told the outlet. The bakery was closed over the weekend, with calls seeking
  comment going unanswered. Rob Rowan, public information officer for the
  Paterson police department, confirmed details of Thursday morning’s attack in
  a statement, adding that the knifeman had not been identified and was still at
  large. “Officers responded to Baladna Bakery on reports of a stabbing,” he
  said. “They saw both victims being treated for lacerations made by a sharp
  instrument. The victim stated an altercation began between a customer and the
  victims with the customer unhappy about a purchase at the store.” Rowan said
  the department’s major crimes unit was investigating. Incidents of extreme
  violence in disputes over the serving of food have become increasingly common
  in the US in recent years. In 2019, a man was stabbed to death at a Maryland
  Popeyes restaurant in a fight over line cutting among customers eager to try
  the company’s new chicken sandwich. In May, a Checkers employee in Kissimmee,
  Florida, was accused of shooting and killing a customer who complained that
  sachets of mayonnaise were missing from his order.
