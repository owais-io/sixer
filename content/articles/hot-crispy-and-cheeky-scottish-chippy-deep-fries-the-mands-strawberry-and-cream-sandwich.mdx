  Marks &amp; Spencer has always been at the forefront of sandwich innovation,
  having launched the first pre-packed sandwich in the spring of 1980 and
  raising eyebrows this summer by selling one with strawberry and cream filling.
  But now a Scottish chip shop has gone a step further, offering to batter and
  deep-fry the viral snack. In a video posted on TikTok, staff at Hook and Catch
  near Glasgow can be seen dipping M&amp;S’s controversial “Strawberry and
  Creme” sandwich into batter, before deep-frying it, slicing it in half and
  serving with strawberry sauce. A staff member from the chip shop based in
  Bearsden in East Dunbartonshire said: “We love putting a playful Scottish
  chippy twist on things people already recognise. When the M&amp;S strawberries
  buzz kicked off, we thought, why not try them hot, crispy, and a bit cheeky?
  The strawberry sandwich was our way of leaning into summer with something fun,
  surprising and very Hook and Catch.” The clip has attracted thousands of
  views, with commenters describing the treat as a “crazy creation”. Staff say
  they have already had multiple people come in to try the sandwich, and say
  they love seeing the reactions. “The reaction’s been brilliant – lots of
  curious first-timers, plenty of ‘no way … OK, maybe’ moments, and a fair few
  instant converts,” said a representative. “It’s been a proper conversation
  starter in the shop and online, and we’ve had people coming in just to try it
  and film their first bite. “We’ve always had fun with desserts – our famous
  Glaswegian doughnut has been a customer favourite for ages. It’s our
  tongue-in-cheek take on the American-style deep-fried doughnut, but done the
  Glasgow way.” Its Glaswegian doughnut consists of a crispy battered roll
  stuffed with Nutella and strawberry jam and coated in sugar. The
  representative added: “Between that and the strawberry sandwich, we love
  seeing people’s reactions when they try something they never expected from a
  chippy.” In June, M&amp;S launched its take on the strawberry sando, a
  Japanese convenience store favourite, a sandwich made with soft milk bread,
  whipped cream and neatly layered fruit. The sandwich split opinion, but
  100,000 were sold in the first month after its launch, according to to the
  director of product development at M&amp;S Food, Kathryn Turner.
