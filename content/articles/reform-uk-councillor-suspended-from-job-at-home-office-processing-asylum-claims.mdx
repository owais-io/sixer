  A local councillor for Reform UK who works for the Home Office processing
  asylum and immigration claims has been suspended from his job while an
  investigation is carried out, the Guardian has learned. Paul Bean, who serves
  as a councillor for Crook ward at Durham county council, declared his day job
  as a civil servant at the Home Office in his register of interests. It is
  understood that an investigation by Home Office officials will look at whether
  any breach of the civil service code has occurred. The code states that all
  civil servants should be politically impartial and that civil servants must
  not “allow personal political views to determine any advice you give or your
  actions”. Bean’s role at the Home Office emerged after an investigation by the
  organisation Hope Not Hate. The group found posts criticising asylum seekers
  on a social media account they claim belongs to him. “I work as an asylum
  decision maker for the HO [Home Office] and I can tell you with authority that
  93% of asylum seekers to the UK are men between 18-35 and 92% of them are
  refused asylum,” a post on the account read, adding: “The truth is the vast
  majority of asylum seekers are actually economic migrants abusing the asylum
  system.” According to the most recent statistics, almost half of asylum
  seekers win their cases, with more granted asylum after an appeal. Another
  post reads: “97% of asylum seekers are lying about persecution in their home
  countries and the other 3% have been credible to the point of being
  believable. Source: me. Guess what job I do.” Other posts on the account use
  misogynistic language and are heavily critical of Reform, saying Nigel Farage
  has “submitted” to Islam and looks down on working-class people who give him
  power. Bean has also been suspended by Reform UK, but it is not known if that
  is because of his critical comments about Farage and his party or about other
  posts. Reform UK did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for
  Durham council said: “Due to relevant legislation, Cllr Paul Bean currently
  remains as a councillor representing Reform UK until we are informed by the
  party that he has ‘ceased’ to be a member. “Generally, where councillors are
  suspended as part of their group or party discipline, this is a neutral act
  pending the outcome of an investigation. Until then, Cllr Bean will continue
  to sit on the committees he has been appointed to, and our website will
  reflect his unchanged status.” Amanda Hopgood, the leader of the opposition at
  Durham county council, said: “It’s only right and proper that this issue is
  looked into in the interests of openness and transparency. I welcome the fact
  that the Home Office is looking into this.” Bean was one of 65 Reform UK
  councillors elected in May to Durham county council, giving the party a large
  majority and more councillors than the other parties – Liberal Democrats,
  Greens, independents, Labour and Conservatives – put together. The council was
  previously run as a coalition between the Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and
  independents. Reform UK’s latest policy announcement is for mass deportation
  of asylum seekers back to conflict zones such as Eritrea and Afghanistan, a
  plan Labour has called “pie in the sky”. A Home Office spokesperson said:
  “While it is our longstanding policy not to comment on individual cases, all
  civil servants must adhere to the civil service code, and are expected to
  carry out their role with integrity, honesty, objectivity and political
  impartiality. “Whenever the civil service code is breached, the matter will be
  fully investigated and disciplinary action taken as appropriate.” Bean has
  been approached for comment.
