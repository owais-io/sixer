  A national system to track childcare worker misconduct is key to keeping
  children safe, one of Australia’s largest early education providers has said,
  arguing every worker in every state should be subject to mandatory reporting.
  It comes amid disagreement among states and territories about moves to ban
  mobile phones in childcare centres, before a critical meeting of education
  ministers to decide on new rules about safety training, CCTV and a database to
  track worker movements. After several allegations of abuse of children in
  early education, state and federal governments have been scrambling to update
  rules and crack down on safety in childcare. Amid several snap state reviews,
  the federal education minister, Jason Clare, will bring together his
  counterparts on Friday, where a national register of workers is expected to be
  agreed. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Attorneys general last week agreed to
  work toward a nationally consistent working with children check scheme. Dr Ros
  Baxter, the chief executive of Goodstart Early Learning – which runs more than
  650 centres nationwide – said a national system to log worker misconduct was
  also critical. “We need a national reportable conduct scheme. Five states have
  these, each operating with different rules. Every person in every state should
  be subject to mandatory reporting rules,” she told Guardian Australia. Baxter
  backed a nationally consistent working with children check, raising concerns
  about employers in some states currently not being notified about problems
  registered in other states, and the national register of employment histories.
  South Australia is expected to strongly push for nationally consistent bans
  for personal mobile phones in centres. SA and Victoria have begun implementing
  bans on personal mobiles, which will become a national requirement from 1
  September, while Western Australia announced it would also soon implement a
  ban. SA’s early education minister, Blair Boyer, is expected to address
  Friday’s meeting, outlining how his state will monitor the ban and ensure
  compliance by childcare services. “South Australia was also the first
  jurisdiction with Victoria to implement a personal device ban in early
  learning settings,” he told Guardian Australia. “I’m looking forward to
  discussing with my state and territory colleagues about how we have rolled
  this out to ensure all jurisdictions are in line with each other.” Guardian
  Australia understands that Queensland is more hesitant to implement the mobile
  phone ban, and has concerns over unintended consequences for some centres.
  This week, Victoria, South Australia and WA have also committed millions in
  new funding to update and increase compliance measures. It is understood some
  major childcare providers are also hesitant to fully back calls for CCTV to be
  rolled out further, with questions about costs to install and maintain the
  technology, as well as concerns about keeping camera footage secure and
  avoiding misuse. The WA early childhood minister, Sabine Winton, said she
  would also be pushing for immediate actions including mandatory safety
  training. “I will also be placing strong focus on advocating for building the
  capacity of the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority and
  state-based regulators,” she said. “While all measures to increase child
  safety should be explored, my focus is on tangible actions that can be
  implemented now.” NSW and Queensland will be pushing for the national register
  of childcare workers as the highest priority. The Queensland education
  minister, John-Paul Langbroek, said a register will be critical to ensuring
  child safety, promising to, “continue calling for the urgent introduction of a
  national early childhood educator register at this week’s education ministers
  meeting”. Meanwhile, NSW will also push for a national register, but the
  acting minister for education and early learning, Courtney Houssos, said the
  state would be prepared to move alone if other states weren’t willing to
  rapidly implement stronger reforms. “While NSW is prepared to act alone if
  necessary to implement nation-leading reforms that will put children’s safety
  and wellbeing first, we are also working with other states and the
  commonwealth to reform childcare regulation at a national level. “This
  includes work on the proposed register for early childhood educators, which
  will be most effective if it is implemented nationally.” Baxter said Goodstart
  also wanted to see the extension of federal incentive payments to childcare
  workers beyond its December 2026 cut-off to help attract and retain
  high-quality workers. “Ultimately, the best protection for children remains a
  stable, well trained workforce and a strong safeguarding culture which
  welcomes and encourages reporting where any concerns arise.”
