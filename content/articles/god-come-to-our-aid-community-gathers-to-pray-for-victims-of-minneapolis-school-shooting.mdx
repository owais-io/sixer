  The line wrapped around the brick building, people flowing into a high school
  gym already nearly full of a community in mourning. The vigil at Academy of
  Holy Angels, 2 miles from the site where two schoolchildren were killed by a
  gunman during morning mass at Annunciation church, drew people of all faiths
  from around the Minneapolis metro area. A couple of miles down the road, many
  hundreds gathered in a park for another vigil that called for stricter gun
  control and an end to the senseless violence that has become a fixture of
  American life. Across the Twin Cities metro area, church leaders gathered
  their parishes in prayer and communion, joining together to find solace and
  make sense of the tragedy. Many had ties to the school, or saw their own
  children reflected in the faces of those affected. A shooter at the
  Annunciation Catholic school opened fire on Wednesday morning, spraying
  bullets through stained-glass windows into the pews during morning mass in the
  school’s first week of classes. The two children killed were aged eight and
  10. Fourteen other children and three adults were injured, and officials said
  they expected all to survive. The third casualty was the shooter, who killed
  himself. At Holy Angels, parents filed into the gym, with babies in arms and
  in strollers, and alongside their teens and pre-teens. The opening prayer
  called on God: “Our children were suddenly and violently taken from us. Come
  swiftly to our aid.” Inside, vocalists sang hymns as those gathered joined in.
  They wept and put their arms around one another. Archbishop Bernard A Hebda
  told the packed bleachers and full gym floor that he hoped the community
  gathered in prayer gave the families a sense that they were not alone. Amy
  Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, told the Minnesota Star Tribune the
  family of one of the deceased children was at the school vigil. “It is brave
  to be here tonight,” she told the paper. Hebda said he was struck by the
  children who said their friends shielded them from the bullets – that courage,
  that love in the middle of such tragedy. He implored people to look for hope
  amid their pain. The school’s scripture theme for the year, he noted, was
  Jeremiah 29:11: “For I know full well the plans I have for you, plans for your
  welfare and not for your misfortune, plans that will offer you a future filled
  with hope.” As the crowd inside prayed for the first responders, the families
  of the children who suffered losses, and people suffering from mental illness,
  two crosses were put up outside the door to honor the children who died, with
  “mercy and compassion” written on the back. The long lines and large vigils
  were reminiscent of scenes earlier this summer, after the state lawmaker
  Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were murdered at their home by a gunman
  imitating a police officer. The Hortman family issued a public statement late
  Wednesday, saying no one should have to deal with losing loved ones to gun
  violence. “Mark and Melissa believed that children should be able to gather in
  schools safely, that communities should be able to worship in peace, and that
  families should be safe in their homes,” the Hortman family said. “We hope
  this tragedy spurs elected officials to take action towards common sense
  measures on access to high-powered weapons so that no one else must suffer.”
  Flowers laid at a light pole outside the police line near the Annunication
  school earlier in the day had grown in number by nightfall, joined by signs
  showing support and solidarity with the community. “RIP angels,” one sign
  said. At nearby Lynnhurst Park, the crowd held candles and listened to elected
  officials talk about the need for action. As dusk settled, a sliver of a moon
  above, they applauded and cheered when speeches called for stricter gun laws.
  Bikes circled the park – people rode in from around the area. The mayor, Jacob
  Frey, said the shooting was an unspeakable tragedy that never should have
  happened, adding “how many times have you heard a politician at a microphone
  say that?” The city needed to move from “united in grief” to “united in
  action”, he said. The lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, said people needed
  to keep showing up to say that this violence would not be tolerated, she said.
  They needed to demand better laws. She said she was there as a mother and as a
  Catholic, more than as a politician. “God weeps, Jesus weeps in this moment,
  because we have free will and all the tools to stop this violence against our
  children. “We need to love our babies and our children more than our guns.”
