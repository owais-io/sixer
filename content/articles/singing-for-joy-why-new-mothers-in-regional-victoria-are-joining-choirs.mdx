  Toys, books and cushions are strewn over the floor of the community centre
  classroom. The gleeful babbling of babies and toddlers fills the air, rising
  above the background chatter of their mothers. But as soon as the singing
  starts, the children fall silent. The voices of their mothers, singing in
  harmony, fill the room. The lyrics are a mantra: “Go easy on yourself. Go easy
  on the other.” One Mum riffs on the words. “Go easy on the mother.” The group
  is called Singing Mamas. It launched in Ballarat last year as a way to provide
  support and connection to new mums and reduce symptoms of postnatal depression
  through music. Cath Matthews, who recently returned to work after the birth of
  her first child, says it helps her be “in the moment” and find stillness. “You
  can’t think about anything else when you’re thinking about harmonising,” she
  says. Lucy Price, a cellist who has paused performing and teaching since she
  gave birth to her first child, has been attending the sessions since late 2024
  as a way to connect to a part of herself that has been “sitting dormant”.
  “Connecting with other people [through music] is very special,” she says.
  “I’ve seen the powerful impact it has on calming the human nervous system.
  “It’s a nice place to come and it feels safe.” Sign up to receive Guardian
  Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter It’s the second session
  for mother-of-three Tara Mosswood. She says she had been looking for mothers’
  singing groups for a while. “I’ve been singing in a lot of community and a
  cappella choirs for the joy,” Mosswood says. “I’ve been really sad to give
  that up during motherhood.” Group singing can have a positive impact on the
  overall mental health and wellbeing of new mothers, according to research led
  by Prof Rosie Perkins from the Royal College of Music in London. Perkins has
  conducted a number of studies exploring how music activities can support
  mothers experiencing symptoms of postnatal depression and loneliness,
  including a 2018 study which concluded that community singing group
  interventions may reduce symptoms of postnatal depression through
  “facilitating a functional emotional response rooted in the needs of new
  motherhood”. Perkins says in the right environment, group singing can help to
  calm babies and provide mothers with some much-needed “me time”. “It can also
  help mothers to feel a sense of achievement and identity, and to feel
  connected and close to their baby,” she says. “Another one of our studies also
  suggested that group singing can decrease both psychological and biological
  markers of anxiety. I’ve seen these sorts of effects first-hand and heard
  about them from so many parents, musicians, and researchers.” It’s a
  relatively new area of research, Perkins says, adding that it is important to
  work with parents to understand barriers to accessing and attending music, and
  to embed interventions and programs into the health care system. “While the
  research evidence is promising, we still need more evidence about when, how,
  and for whom music can support new parents,” she says. “The research has
  tended to focus on mothers, so more work with fathers and partners will be an
  important next step.” Singing Mamas groups already operate in most Australian
  capital cities and have started popping up in regional towns including
  Ballarat and Bellingen in New South Wales. The MaCapella Singers in
  Castlemaine, central Victoria, runs on a similar ethos. George Williams is a
  co-facilitator at Ballarat’s Singing Mamas and says the program is focused on
  addressing suicide prevention and postnatal depression. Suicide is known to be
  one of the leading causes of death for women during pregnancy and one year
  after birth. Williams says it is important for these groups to spread out in
  more regional and rural communities. “We know Ballarat and we understand when
  you do something in Ballarat, you can see its impact,” she says. “That’s the
  beauty of going regional.” It also builds on a national push to lean on the
  arts and creative industries to play a role in addressing the growing mental
  health crisis in regional areas, by advancing a “whole of community” approach
  to combatting isolation and developing resilience. A 2022 report by the
  Australian Council for the Arts found that by operating outside healthcare
  settings, “artists are engaging communities that have low rates of ‘help
  seeking’, and communities that are marginalised, disadvantaged, regional and
  remote”. Williams says mothers’ voices don’t always get heard outside the
  house. She says spaces like Singing Mamas are the “upside downing” of the
  dominant narrative, focusing not on the babies, but on the mothers. “We
  recognise it’s the peer support that’s important and there’s so much
  intergenerational learning and wellbeing and co-regulation that occurs in each
  session,” she says. “The birthing parents have gone through such an incredible
  transformation and there’s no real formal safety net or recognition of that.
  The creative arts is a really smart way to help support that process.” In
