  The government is facing calls to explain why it has yet to implement all the
  recommendations from a 2023 review into a spate of serious public sector data
  breaches, including the exposure of Afghans who worked with British military,
  victims of child sexual abuse and 6,000 disability claimants. On Thursday
  ministers finally published the information security review, which was
  triggered by the 2023 leak of personal data of about 10,000 serving officers
  in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The review by Cabinet Office
  officials into 11 public sector data breaches, encompassing the HMRC, the
  Metropolitan police, the benefits system and the MoD, found three common
  themes: A lack of controls over ad hoc downloads and exports of aggregations
  of sensitive data. The release of sensitive information via “wrong recipient”
  emails and failure to use bcc properly. Hidden personal data emerging from
  spreadsheets destined for release. The release of the review, 22 months after
  it was completed and a month after the leak of an database of 18,700 Afghans
  became public, was welcomed by Chi Onwurah, chair of the science, innovation
  and technology committee. But she said: “It’s concerning that it took an
  intervention from my committee and the information commissioner to make this
  happen.” The Afghan data breach led to people fearing for their safety under
  the Taliban and to the UK government offering relocation to thousands of
  Afghans under a secret scheme. The government said it had delivered on 12 of
  the 14 recommendations about toughening up data security. Onwurah said: “The
  government still has questions to answer about the review. Why have only 12 of
  the 14 recommendations been implemented? And why has it kept the very
  existence of this review a secret for so long, even after the 2022
  Afghanbreach became public? “For the government to fulfil its ambitions of
  using tech to boost the economy and transform our public sector, it needs the
  public to trust that it can keep their data secure. If it can’t, how can
  anyone be comfortable handing over their personal information?” The
  information commissioner, John Edwards, called on the government to go
  “further and faster to ensure Whitehall, and the wider public sector put their
  practices in order”. He told the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, on
  Thursday that “as a matter of urgency, the government should fully implement
  the recommendations of the Information Security Review”. It was not
  immediately clear which of the 14 recommendations had yet to be implemented.
  The full list included the government working with the National Cyber Security
  Centre to assess existing guidance on technical controls for products and
  services hosting information marked “official”, the need to launch a
  cross-government “behavioural influence communications campaign to address
  persistent poor information handling practices”, and the necessity of a
  “review sanctions for negligence”. McFadden and Peter Kyle, the secretary of
  state for science, innovation and technology, told Onwurah in a letter on
  Thursday: “Good progress has been made but we must guard against complacency.
  This is an area on which we must keep a consistent focus to ensure standards
  continue to improve.” A government spokesperson said: “This review concluded
  in 2023 under the previous government. “Protecting national security,
  including the security of government data, is one of our primary
  responsibilities. Since taking power, we have strengthened security guidance
  across departments, updated mandatory training for civil servants, and
  announced plans to upgrade digital infrastructure across the public sector as
  set out in our Blueprint for Modern Digital Government.”
