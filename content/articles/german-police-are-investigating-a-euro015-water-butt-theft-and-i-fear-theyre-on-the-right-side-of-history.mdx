  German police are investigating a €0.15 water butt theft – and I fear they’re
  on the right side of history

  Here’s a silly season story for you: a 51-year-old woman in the German town of
  Spaichingen in Swabia is under criminal investigation on suspicion of filling
  watering cans from her neighbour’s water butt. The total estimated value of
  the purloined water: €0.15. It’s wonderfully daft. She allegedly hid behind a
  bin to evade detection and, according to reports, the police declared, with
  Solomonic gravity: “Once it is in the barrel, [the water] no longer belongs to
  the heavens.” Who knows what motivated this nano-crime: a moment of midlife
  madness? Some kind of grudge? But water is metered in Germany so there might
  be a kind of extreme parsimony at work (Swabian housewives are legendarily
  thrifty, apparently). Extreme frugality can be quite funny. Not the kind
  motivated by financial hardship, which is as unfunny as it gets (and deepening
  and widening in the UK, with “Dickensian levels” of child poverty being
  reported by the children’s commissioner). But the other kind – the Uncle
  Scrooge variety, where people choose the teabag-redunking,
  loo-roll-square-counting life – is presented as an entertaining personality
  type, the kind you might see spotlighted on a Channel 5 show (perhaps set in
  Yorkshire; after all, my people aren’t famous for their largesse). It’s
  probably too late to pitch Channel 5, though, because “Extreme Cheapskates” –
  a US import – already exists. I watched a bit, while thinking about the
  Swabian butt theft, and some of these people are, to put it mildly,
  exceptionally dedicated to thrift. There’s a woman who flosses with her own
  hair (it must be freakishly strong, what does she use on it?) and keeps chewed
  gum in the freezer to reuse multiple days, another – apparently a millionaire!
  – who pees in jars to keep her water bills down, and a man who does the
  washing up and warms soup in his hot tub. Other so-called cheapskate tricks,
  though, seem perfectly reasonable. Using roadkill for its fur sounds sensible
  (it’s dead anyway), as does reusing bathwater or keeping jeans in the freezer
  instead of washing them. Over time, I have started to find frugality more
  appealing myself, albeit inconsistently: I will place a leftover half potato
  on a saucer in the fridge with a reverence usually reserved for holy relics,
  but spend £4 on a basic cake I could make for pennies. But I certainly get
  more and more pleasure from minor domestic acts of meanness: I hoard and reuse
  plastic food bags and boxes eternally (microplastics be damned; I’m sure
  something else will kill me first) and redunk teabags, though purely for my
  own consumption and mostly camomile, which tastes of nothing in the first
  place, so no harm done. I even dunk myself in my husband’s bathwater
  occasionally. Does that sound weird and gross? Maybe, maybe not – there’s a
  spectrum, from last days of Rome profligacy to making lasagne in the
  dishwasher (another Extreme Cheapskate trick), and we are mostly somewhere in
  the middle. The extremely frugal by choice, though, measuring out their lives
  in coffee spoons pinched from the work canteen, are mostly seen as comical,
  silly and slightly sad. We have internalised an idea that lavishness is
  life-affirming – live a little, use the good bath oil, as Nora Ephron said
  (impossible: I’ll die with the good bath oil dusty and unopened, taking a grim
  last satisfaction at having saved it). But isn’t the opposite true? Aren’t the
  real sad weirdos the ones throwing yacht foam parties and sending Katy Perry
  into space? Appreciating every drop and crumb and being careful can be
  life-affirming, and life- (on Earth, in the wider sense) prolonging. We’re not
  facing the kind of horror we are seeing in Gaza, but this summer, UK farmers
  are sounding alarm bells at the prospect of poor harvests and the difficulties
  they are facing feeding livestock, and I have just read a bleak French news
  story about the effect of extreme heat on poultry farms (apparently 750,000
  chickens died there as a result of 2023’s less dramatic heatwaves; worse is
  predicted this year). Nicking your neighbour’s water isn’t OK (and
  disturbingly end of days), and I’m not up for hair flossing – I don’t even
  have hair to floss with. But when natural resources are becoming scarcer, a
  “scarcity mindset” starts to make a lot of sense and the extremely frugal
  might have the last laugh. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist
