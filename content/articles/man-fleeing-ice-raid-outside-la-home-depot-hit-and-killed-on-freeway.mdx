  A man was hit by a vehicle and killed as he attempted to get away from federal
  immigration officers who were raiding a Home Depot in Los Angeles county on
  Thursday morning, according to authorities. Little has been disclosed about
  the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) operation that led to the
  incident, but officials in Monrovia, a diverse LA suburb tucked into the
  foothills of the San Gabriel mountains, confirmed agents had been seen at the
  store by city police officers shortly before 10am local time. Shortly after,
  Monrovia fire and rescue responded to reports of a pedestrian struck on the
  210 freeway, a large interstate with four lanes in each direction. The man,
  who has not been identified, was transported to a local hospital, where he
  died from his injuries. “There is no ongoing Ice activity reported in Monrovia
  at this time, and the city has not received any communication or information
  from Ice,” said Monrovia city manager Dylan Feik in a statement, adding: “We
  extend our condolences for the individual and his family.” This raid was one
  of several in recent weeks that targeted southern California Home Depot
  locations; the home improvement store allows day laborers to wait for work
  opportunities outside. State assembly member John Harabedian, who represents
  the area, said in a statement provided to the Guardian that 10 people were
  detained during Thursday’s operation. “One individual, fearing for their
  safety, fled and was tragically struck by a vehicle,” he said. Donald Trump,
  who ran on promises of a heavy-handed crackdown and mass deportation, has
  presided over an intensely anti-immigrant agenda. More than 60,000 people were
  in immigration detention in August, according to reporting from the New York
  Times, breaking the record Trump set in his first term. The administration has
  strengthened the federal government’s ability to detain and deport, while the
  president’s Republican allies in Congress oversaw increases that more than
  tripled Ice’s budget. California, which has been a sanctuary state that
  protects immigrant rights, has been a prime target for federal raids. Earlier
  this month, the US justice department published a list of such states, cities
  and counties, claiming they “impede enforcement of federal immigration laws”
  and promising to eradicate the policies through litigation. The state’s
  protections haven’t stopped federal agents’ raids, which have continued in the
  face of local protests. They have also sparked widespread fear in immigrant
  communities. Cultural and musical events have been canceled across the
  country, religious gatherings have been dispensed, and workers have left jobs
  in areas where raids are occurring. A woman who is legally protected from
  deportation by her Daca status told the Guardian last month that she and
  others are fearful to even run errands. “We’re scared,” she said. “When we go
  to the store to get groceries, we have the feeling that someone is following
  us. Sometimes we don’t want to go to the doctor or dentist.” Calling the
  actions “inhumane”, Harabedian said the immigration enforcement actions were
  harming communities, not protecting them. “Raids like this do not make our
  streets safer – they terrorize families, instill fear and put lives at risk,”
  he said. “My thoughts are with those harmed and targeted by this frightening
  and chaotic raid. We will continue to stand with our immigrant communities.”
