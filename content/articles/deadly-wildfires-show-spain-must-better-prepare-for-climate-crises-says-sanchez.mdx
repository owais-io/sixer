  The wildfires that have devoured 382,000 hectares of land in Spain and killed
  four people underscore the need to “readjust and recalibrate” the country’s
  preparation and response capacities as part of a non-partisan effort to tackle
  the impacts of the climate emergency, the prime minister has warned. Speaking
  during a visit to the south-western region of Extremadura on Tuesday, Pedro
  Sánchez said that while the record-breaking 16-day heatwave that had fanned
  the flames was over, “difficult hours” lay ahead as firefighters continued to
  battle huge blazes across parts of the country. The prime minister said the
  wildfires – and last year’s disastrous floods in the eastern region of
  Valencia – were clear proof that the climate emergency was hitting Spain
  harder and harder each year. According to Spain’s Carlos III public health
  institute, 1,149 excess deaths across the country between 3 August and 18
  August are likely to have been linked to the heatwave. “We need to prepare and
  be better equipped with mechanisms and tools so that we can mitigate the
  effects of these climate emergencies when they happen,” said Sánchez. “The
  climate emergency is getting worse and more recurrent each year, and the
  effects of that emergency are accelerating each year.” He said that when he
  had spoken to people affected by the fires, they had told him that they
  expected a non-ideological approach to the climate emergency that went beyond
  four-year governmental terms. “For all the scientific predictions about how
  the climate emergency would apparently evolve, we’re seeing that it’s getting
  worse and hitting much harder each year, particularly across the Iberian
  peninsula,” he said. “We need to readjust and recalibrate both our response
  and prevention capacities.” The prime minister, who has already called for a
  “state pact” to address the climate emergency, said he would outline his plan
  early next month. “If the climate emergency is getting worse each year, we
  need to move beyond legislatures and turn climate emergency policies into
  state policies that bind all our institutions and all those that govern,” he
  added. The response to the wildfires across many of Spain’s self-governing
  regions has been beset with familiar political arguments. The opposition
  conservative People’s party (PP) has accused Sánchez of touting the pact as a
  means to deflect criticism of what it claims has been his poor handling of the
  crisis. “State pacts don’t put out the flames, nor do they restore what’s been
  lost,” a PP spokesperson said on Monday. “People were expecting a lot more
  than a smokescreen designed to save his reputation after he’d gone missing for
  a week.” The PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, said the prime minister had
  ignored repeated calls for more troops to be sent to the hardest-hit areas and
  had failed to invest sufficiently in prevention. “Sánchez’s duty is to send
  help, not to skimp and always improvise,” he said on Tuesday. Police in Spain
  have arrested 32 people for suspected arson since 1 June, while 93 others are
  under investigation, according to the interior ministry. Thousands of
  firefighters are still tackling blazes in neighbouring Portugal, where
  wildfires have claimed two lives and burned about 235,000 hectares of land. •

  incorrectly that wildfires in Spain had burned more land this year than in any
  year on record. This has been replaced.
