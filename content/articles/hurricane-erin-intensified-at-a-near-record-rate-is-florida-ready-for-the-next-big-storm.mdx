  This season’s first hurricane – and the first of the Trump administration’s
  new era of meteorological austerity – has been making its closest pass to the
  US this week. On Friday morning, weaker than days earlier, it was still a
  large storm, heading north-east, and affecting the US east coast with threats
  of coastal flooding. But at its peak earlier this week, Hurricane Erin was one
  of the strongest and largest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.
  Worryingly, Hurricane Erin also intensified at nearly the fastest rate ever
  seen in the Atlantic basin last weekend, going from a tropical storm to
  category 5 in about 24 hours. Only a handful of hurricanes in history have
  strengthened so quickly into as large and intense a storm as Erin. Erin’s
  extremely rapid intensification underscores the danger of hurricane season in
  an era of climate crisis, a diminished Fema and an understaffed National
  Weather Service. Although Hurricane Erin’s impact has been limited to some
  heavy rains in Puerto Rico and huge waves along the east coast, many emergency
  managers in storm-weary Florida took it as a warning sign. “My initial
  thoughts were: thank you, Jesus, it’s not coming to Florida,” said Heather
  Henderson-Scheu, the emergency management director of Suwannee county,
  Florida, which is about 80 miles east of Tallahassee. “This is becoming the
  new reality,” said Henderson-Scheu. “It’s really concerning because it doesn’t
  give you as much time to prepare, even though we’re inland.” In 2023,
  Hurricane Idalia grew from a category 1 to a category 4 in less than 24 hours,
  becoming the strongest storm to affect Florida’s Big Bend region in more than
  70 years. Including Idalia, four hurricanes have made landfall in Florida in
  less than two years. All four of them have tracked near or over Suwannee
  county, home to more than 50,000 people and the heart of the state’s poultry
  industry, which has suffered greatly since Helene’s landfall last year. “We
  got calls all weekend about Erin,” said Henderson-Scheu. “After what we’ve
  been through, people are real eager to not stay in their houses any more.”
  Rapid intensification just before landfall – defined as a windspeed increase
  of at least 35mph in less than 24 hours – is now happening five times more
  often than it did in the 1980s, a trend that scientists have recently
  attributed to global warming. The waters where the intensification happened
  were record warm, a record that was made at least 100 times more likely due to
  climate change per an analysis from Climate Central. Those record warm waters
  probably added about 9mph to its peak wind speed, enough to boost it from a
  category 4 to a category 5. The ability for scientists to forecast the
  conditions that lead to rapid intensification has improved greatly over the
  past 10 years or so, in part because these conditions are happening much more
  often now. There have been 42 hurricanes that have reached category 5 in the
  Atlantic since records began in 1851, and 11 of those have happened in the
  past 10 years. Erin’s intensification rate was not perfectly captured by the
  National Hurricane Center in advance, nor by any of the computer models it
  uses. Emergency managers told the Guardian they don’t need perfect forecasts
  to take appropriate actions in advance. “The situation just calls for
  understanding that our expected impacts can change very rapidly,” said Megan
  Milanese, the emergency management director for Lake county, Florida, just
  west of Orlando. “So, typically what we do is we plan for the worst situation
  and hope for the better one, and that way we have that preparation in place if
  the worst thing occurs.” Emergency planning under that kind of uncertainty
  isn’t a new struggle for emergency managers. During Hurricane Ian in 2022,
  initial forecasts showed the storm would track parallel to Florida’s west
  coast, which meant that small changes in the storm’s expected path resulted in
  large changes to the storm’s expected landfall location. “We’re all sort of
  expectant of these sort of small shifts in the grand scheme of Earth, but big
  changes for us,” said Lane Schneider, the emergency management director for
  Hardee county, Florida, east of Sarasota. “A lot of times, it just doesn’t
  necessarily matter where in the state it goes because we’re also used to the
  storms just being large and preparing for it anyways.” The onslaught of
  hurricanes in recent years have helped Henderson-Scheu and her team hone their
  county’s hurricane plans to the point that it now takes just several hours to
  coordinate resources with the governor’s office and the county’s school
  system, open up shelters, and begin the evacuation process. “What we’re trying
  to do in our community is change that mindset of it’s not going to ever happen
  here,” said Henderson-Scheu. “Now it’s about when it happens here, because it
  has happened here, and because of the temperatures of the ocean, it is going
  to continue to happen here. So we’re really pushing preparedness.” Eric
