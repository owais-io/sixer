  I recently came across a letter to an ethicist that made me stop. A doctor’s
  mother sustained a head injury from falling on concrete. The son bypassed two
  hospitals to take her to his institution where she received prompt treatment
  that led to her having a scan and staples in an hour. For any other patient,
  the writer argued, the ordeal would have taken five hours. After consulting
  religious leaders (with opposing views), the writer sought the ethicist’s
  opinion on the doctor’s conduct. Reading this, I thought mea culpa. When my
  son was three, he developed urinary retention. After watching his tiny abdomen
  swell, I didn’t know what was wrong but I knew where to go – overlooking not
  one but two children’s hospitals in favour of my own institution. Here I was
  met by the emergency physician who had once taught me to insert IVs in
  children. After performing a quick ultrasound he prescribed the sound of
  running water and patience. But with midnight approaching I worried that a
  longer wait in emergency meant cancelling my own patients the next day.
  Shortly, the consultant made time for an “in and out catheter” and we got
  home. The next day, my son became incontinent. Worried about a spinal cord
  issue, I called my paediatrician friend who calmly reassured me that the
  problem would fix itself – as it did. Some years later, when my dad collapsed
  at dinner, the ambulance whisked him to my hospital. He underwent the usual
  triage but that night, the head of cardiology, also a former boss, dropped by
  – not to take over but to reassure. Recently my mother called me in acute
  pain. Before dashing to hospital, I called a surgeon who confidently diagnosed
  her problem and advised staying home. He reassured her in Hindi and even
  offered to drop in, a generous and ultimately unnecessary offer. For a worried
  parent to have immediate access to paediatricians. For a worried daughter to
  have specialists as friends. You would have to be possessed of a special kind
  of imperviousness to not admit the privilege of this position, especially in
  an era of fragmented healthcare and long waitlists. When one’s child or parent
  is ill, clinical neutrality is impossible – indeed, I would consider it a
  dereliction of my parental or filial duty. So the real question I wrestled
  with is this: when I harness my connections, am I harming someone else? Social
  capital allows people everywhere to “jump the queue”. The banker negotiates a
  better mortgage rate. The CEO’s child nabs a place at a private school. The
  celebrity secures concert tickets the rest of us can’t. Medicine, of course,
  carries a distinct obligation – the Hippocratic oath. But even when (justly)
  judged by this high standard, most doctors exceed it. With ingrained training
  to put clinical need before social status, they would never knowingly
  compromise another patient’s care to help a colleague. The emergency physician
  did not leave the resuscitation bay to treat my child. The paediatrician’s
  reassurance did not move another child’s appointment. The cardiologist did not
  neglect someone’s heart attack and the surgeon did not abandon a patient on an
  operating table to answer my call. Doctors fulfil their duty to patients and
  then extend themselves to a colleague because this is how a social contract
  works. Some days, the healthcare “community” barely deserves that name, with
  every profession at odds with another. But when one of us gets sick – be it a
  doctor, porter or security guard – a remarkable solidarity emerges. When we
  help our own, we get them back on their feet to help our patients. This is
  cause for hope and succour. However, our solidarity is not confined. I receive
  terrified questions about cancer from all manner of people. In guiding them to
  the best of my capacity, I often think about the Bible verse: “From everyone
  who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been
  entrusted with much, much more will be asked.” My approach is repeated across
  all the medical chat groups I belong to, where the uncommon request for
  personal favours is outnumbered by doctors seeking help for a patient: Who can
  expedite patient care? Who can speak another language? Is there compassionate
  access to a new drug? Where is the nearest clinical trial? Day and night,
  doctors respond swiftly, intelligently and compassionately. This constant,
  behind-the-scenes hive of activity is the best illustration that most doctors
  recognise their privilege and, with it, the obligation to pay it forward. One
  of my all-time favourite accounts about social capital has little to do with
  medicine and everything to do with generosity. Years ago, my young patient
  died, leaving behind young children. Her husband would send me occasional
  updates about the kids, which inevitably made me sad. One day, her son got in
  touch. Now at university, he had curated a list of people he wanted career
  advice from but didn’t know how to approach them. Impressed by his
  preparation, I agreed to help but warned against great expectations. Here is
  the thing: every single person on that list I wrote to made time. While I had
  not been able to save his mother, it felt like a small, collective justice to
  lift up her son. The doctor who took his mother to emergency did what most
  children would do. The people who treated his mother did what any professional
  would do – assess, decide and act. If you have a doctor in your family, you
  are privileged. But if you don’t, rest assured, we have your back. Ranjana
