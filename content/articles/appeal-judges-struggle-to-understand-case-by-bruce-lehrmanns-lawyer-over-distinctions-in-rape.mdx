  Appeal judges have “struggled to understand” the case made by Bruce Lehrmann’s
  lawyer, who says the federal court judgment that her client raped Brittany
  Higgins in Parliament House in 2019 found the action was a “soft rape” but was
  characterised in a Network Ten broadcast as a “violent” assault. Sydney
  criminal solicitor Zali Burrows – representing Lehrmann because, as the court
  heard Wednesday, he “couldn’t afford” his chosen barrister – submitted that
  her client was not given an opportunity to be questioned about the type of
  rape found by Justice Michael Lee. “It was asserted against Mr Lehrmann … that
  he violently raped, that it was done in a violent nature,” Burrows said on day
  two of the appeal hearing. “Whereas His Honour found a totally different case
  as if it was, using the phrase, a soft rape.” One of the three judges, Justice
  Michael Wigney, did not accept Burrows’ summary of Lee’s judgment or her
  suggestion Lee “made a new case up”. “I don’t think His Honour said anything
  about a violent rape or a soft rape,” Wigney said. “He made findings about
  what happened and what Mr Lehrmann’s state of mind was. I’m struggling to
  understand by what you mean that it was a new case.” Colvin shut her down
  again when she said that no reporters had “anything nice to say” to her client
  and failed to ask him “are you OK?”. “Is this a speech or this a submission?”
  Colvin said. Lehrmann is appealing Lee’s April 2024 judgment, which found the
  former Liberal staffer was not defamed by Lisa Wilkinson and Network 10 when
  The Project broadcast an interview with Brittany Higgins in 2021 in which she
  alleged she was raped in Parliament House. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Burrows repeatedly asked the court to adjourn early to give her more time to
  prepare, but the justices refused, telling the solicitor she had had “plenty”
  of time. Wigney said Burrows had already “obtained the court’s indulgence” to
  commence her reply to submissions a day later than scheduled, and she should
  start her response. “If I can put it this way, nothing that has occurred this
  morning has impacted, or could impact, on your ability to reply to those
  matters,” Wigney said. Burrows tried again, saying the appeal was set down for
  three days. “We still have tomorrow … we were just thinking if we could have a
  10.15 start tomorrow, we’d be finished before lunchtime,” she said. Wigney
  again declined the request, telling Burrows to “start now” and reminding her
  she had “more time over lunch” to sort out any issues she had with the
  transcript. Burrows began speaking but immediately asked for a clarification
  to an earlier question from Colvin about a challenge to the underlying
  findings. “It seems to me to be a very important and central issue for your
  appeal,” Wigney said. “It’s your appeal. What are the… do you understand the
  reference to the underlying facts?” Wigney said Burrows had been in possession
  of Ten’s written submissions “for some time, quite clearly”, and they list the
  underlying facts “in quite simple terms”. “So you’ve had plenty of opportunity
  to consider this issue,” he said. Burrows came back a third time, asking:
  “Would it be possible if we could have an early lunch and then resume
  earlier?” Wigney agreed, adjourning about 10 minutes early. Burrows asked once
  more at the end of the day if she could finish early. “There are further
  documents I prepared but I’m embarrassed to say they’re not here. Can we
  finish early and resume tomorrow morning?” she asked. Wigney replied: “I don’t
  think so, I think we need to resume [now].” The court published written
  submissions from the appellant and respondents, including Lehrmann’s reply to
  Wilkinson’s notice of contention, which challenges Lee’s finding that she and
  The Project team had failed in their defence of qualified privilege, known as
  section 30. The Project’s decision not to name Lehrmann as the alleged
  Parliament House rapist was used as evidence of the “reasonableness” of
  Wilkinson’s journalism in her bid to assert qualified privilege. However,
  Lehrmann claimed the decision not to name him was a “crafted strategy” to
  increase interest in the interview with Higgins. “Mr Lehrmann does not agree
  with Ms Wilkinson’s assertion it was a factor to consider on assessing
  reasonableness, that in effect she should be commended for not naming Mr
  Lehrmann in the program is viewed as disingenuous, and viewed as a crafted
  strategy,” the reply said. Not naming him was a ploy to “maximise the ratings
  of a story, to achieve an exciting air of mystery akin to a ‘whodunnit’.”
  Lehrmann was charged with sexual intercourse without consent in 2021, and at
  his criminal trial in 2022, he pleaded not guilty, denying that any sexual
  activity had occurred. After his criminal trial was aborted in December 2022,
  prosecutors dropped charges against Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Higgins,
  saying a retrial would pose an “unacceptable risk” to her health. Lehrmann has
  maintained his innocence. The hearing wrapped up one day early and the
  justices have reserved their decision. • Information and support for anyone
