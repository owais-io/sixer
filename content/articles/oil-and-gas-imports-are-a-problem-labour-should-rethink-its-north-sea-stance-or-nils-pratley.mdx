  If the chancellor is looking for a pro-growth, pro-jobs, tax-raising policy
  that would be popular with major trade unions and might even be noticed by the
  bond markets, here’s one: boost production of oil and gas in the North Sea.
  And make the argument that the UK’s current over-reliance on imported supplies
  isn’t doing anything to help the climate emergency. There are obvious
  political problems, of course. First, Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, has just
  made her pitch to ramp up North Sea volumes and it’s rarely a good look to be
  accused of pinching the opposition’s clothes. But Labour’s vision could be
  different. It would not say that “all” our oil and gas must be extracted –
  Badenoch’s implausible ambition. It would emphasise that achieving net zero
  emissions by 2050 is still the priority and the energy transition will still
  happen. But it would concede that the decline in domestic oil and gas
  production must be addressed in light of geopolitical risks, the carbon
  consequences of relying on imports, and concerns over jobs. The second
  political problem is more basic: Labour’s manifesto ruled out new licences to
  explore new fields, arguing they would “only accelerate the worsening climate
  crisis”. But is there wriggle room there? The hard reality is that the UK will
  still consume a lot of fossil fuels even under a successful 2050 transition.
  From a climate perspective, an almost unarguable point is that the UK’s
  reliance on imported gas in liquefied form is an outrage. Such imports from
  the US, Qatar, Algeria and other countries made up a quarter of UK gas
  supplies last year and are demonstrably worse for the planet than gas produced
  at home. The government’s own licensing and regulatory body, the North Sea
  Transition Authority, has been clear on the pollution point. “The average
  carbon intensity of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) is almost four times
  the carbon intensity of UK production,” it said in a report a couple of years
  ago. The reason is straightforward: liquefaction, transportation across oceans
  and regasification all add emissions. At a push, one might argue that LNG was
  temporarily tolerable if UK consumption of gas were set to disappear by, say,
  2035. But you’ll struggle to find an energy analyst who thinks that will
  happen. Gas may dwindle to next to nothing for the purposes of electricity
  generation, but the lion’s share of its use is for domestic heating and
  cooking, where phasing out will inevitably be slower. The case for boosting
  oil production is trickier because most North Sea production is exported
  (partly because that’s how the oil industry works, and partly because of the
  closure of UK refineries such as Grangemouth). But the overall picture is
  still that oil and gas accounts for 75% of the UK’s energy needs today and the
  reliance on imports has reached 40%. Nobody pretends the UK will ever again
  become a net exporter of oil and gas – the North Sea is still a basin in
  long-term decline – but the net cost of energy imports last year was almost
  £21bn. It all counts against the balance of payments and ripples through the
  economy. Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), the industry’s trade body, thinks North
  Sea-dependent jobs are being lost at a rate of 1,000 a month. Gary Smith, the
  leader of the GMB union, joined the political dots in an interview with the
  New Statesman in July: “We have been decarbonising through deindustrialisation
  and it’s counterproductive because the communities that have seen their
  industries closed down, they’ve been abandoned and will end up voting for the
  right, and exactly the way that they have in America.” Is there a way to
  square the circle and interpret the manifesto pledge flexibly to boost
  homegrown production? The most interesting idea on that score came last week
  from Prof John Underhill, the director for energy transition at the University
  of Aberdeen. Switch to a system of “bespoke” applications for “near-field
  exploration or infrastructure-led drilling around existing fields and …
  strategically important pipelines,” he said. In other words, make best use of
  the existing infrastructure to ensure supplies aren’t shut in. But also,
  argued Underhill, ensure homegrown emissions are driven down by banning
  flaring and promoting electrification on platforms, which is how Norway’s
  modern industry has achieved its leading status. It sounds a more intelligent
  and nuanced approach than a blanket “no new licences” policy. The bottom line
  is that the UK, even under a successful transition, is still going to use
  10bn-plus barrels of oil (and gas equivalent) on the way to 2050 on most
  projections. The current trajectory is for 4bn-ish barrels of UK production,
  thinks OEUK, which reckons a “realistic target” would be 6bn under a more
  incentivising tax regime (the other political obstacle). The big-picture point
  is that a policy that encourages domestic production to the least polluting
  standards – while keeping 2050 targets intact – has merit if the UK will
  consume the oil and gas anyway. “The UK still relies heavily on oil and gas
  and, without a clear and pragmatic plan, we risk replacing homegrown supply
  with higher-emission imports,” argues Underhill. It is the point the
  government needs to address.
