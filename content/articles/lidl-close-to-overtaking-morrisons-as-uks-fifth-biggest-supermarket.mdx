  Lidl is close to overtaking Morrisons to become the UK’s fifth-biggest
  supermarket chain after a sales rise as shoppers attempted to offset higher
  household bills with cheap groceries. The German-owned discounter increased
  sales by 10.7% in the three months to 11 August, according to the latest
  market share data from analysts at Worldpanel, formerly known as Kantar. This
  was more than double the pace of the wider market, which rose 4.5%. That put
  Lidl’s share of the grocery market at 8.3%, 0.1 percentage points off
  Morrisons’ share of 8.4%, as the Bradford-based chain continued to struggle
  with sales up just 0.9%. Morrisons is trying to turn around performance after
  building up debts in a £7bn takeover by the US private equity group Clayton,
  Dubilier &amp; Rice in 2021. Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket chain,
  notched up sales growth of 7.4%, taking its market share to 28.4%, well ahead
  of any rival. Its closest competitor, Sainsbury’s, increased sales by 5.2%,
  taking its market share to 15%. The UK’s No 3 chain, Asda, also continues to
  have difficulties, with sales falling for the 15th month in a row. Its sales
  were down 2.6% despite efforts to turn around performance after the return of
  its former boss Allan Leighton as chair. Asda is in danger of being overtaken
  by the discounter Aldi, which is just one percentage point behind it with a
  market share of 10.8%. Aldi’s sales grew 4.8% in the past three months. Aldi
  and Lidl continue to rapidly open stores, putting them on track to enter the
  top tier of British supermarkets and disrupt the traditional “big four”. The
  research also showed grocery inflation of 5% in August. Worldpanel said
  inflation had eased 0.2 percentage points in August from the 5.2% rate
  registered in July as prices of dog food, sweets and sparkling wine, including
  champagne, fell back. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight
  at Worldpanel, said: “We’ve seen a marginal drop in grocery price inflation
  this month, but we’re still well past the point at which price rises really
  start to bite and consumers are continuing to adapt their behaviour to make
  ends meet. “What people pay for their supermarket shopping often impacts their
  spending across other parts of the high street, too, including their eating
  and drinking habits out of the home.” He said casual dining and fast food
  restaurants had recorded a particular decline in visitors over the summer, and
  such trips had fallen by 6% during the three months to mid-July 2025 compared
  with last year. However, coffee shops bucked the trend as their sales
  continued to rise. While cutting back on dining out, households appeared more
  prepared to treat themselves at home. Sales of branded goods were up 6.1%,
  growing faster than own-label alternatives, which rose 4.1%, a turnaround from
  earlier in the year. Premium own-label goods, such as Sainsbury’s Taste the
  Difference or Tesco’s Finest ranges, were also up strongly – by 11.5%. While
  still relatively high, the potential peak in inflation could be good news for
  the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as she weighs spending cuts or tax rises in her
  autumn budget.
