  South Korean authorities have begun removing loudspeakers that blare
  propaganda broadcasts along its border with the North, Seoul’s defence
  ministry said on Monday, as the new government of President Lee Jae Myung
  seeks to ease tensions with Pyongyang. South Korea’s dismantling of the
  loudspeakers was a “practical measure that can help ease inter-Korean tensions
  without affecting the military’s readiness posture,” the ministry said in a
  statement. Lee Kyung-ho, a spokesperson for the ministry, didn’t share
  specific details on whether the speakers could be quickly redeployed to the
  border if tensions flared again. There were no discussions between the two
  militaries ahead of the decision, Lee said during a briefing. North Korea,
  which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian
  leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong-un, didn’t immediately
  comment. Shortly after Lee took office in June, his administration switched
  off propaganda broadcasts criticising the North Korean regime as it looked to
  revive stalled dialogue with its neighbour. Pyongyang – which had reacted
  furiously to the hardline policies of Lee’s conservative predecessor, Yoon Suk
  Yeol – has rebuffed recent overtures and said it had no interest in talking to
  South Korea. Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader,
  said last week that Seoul’s “blind trust” in its alliance with the US and its
  hostility toward North Korea made it no different from Yoon’s administration.
  Her comments implied that North Korea – now preoccupied with its expanding
  cooperation with Russia over the war in Ukraine – feels no urgency to resume
  diplomacy with Seoul and Washington. Seoul resumed loudspeaker broadcasts in
  June 2024 after Pyongyang sent nearly a thousand rubbish-filled balloons
  across the border in the space of a few weeks. The broadcasts would “deliver
  messages of light and hope to the North Korean military and citizens”, the
  South said at the time. South Korea’s broadcasts were blasted from multiple
  speakers stacked in large racks and included world news and information about
  democratic and capitalist society with a mix of K-pop music. The sound is
  believed to travel more than 20km (12.4 miles) into North Korea. The cold
  war-style psychological warfare campaign further heightened tensions already
  inflamed by North Korea’s advancing nuclear program and South Korean efforts
  to expand joint military exercises with the US and trilateral security
  cooperation with Japan. The countries remain technically at war after the
  1950-53 Korean war ended only in a truce, and relations have deteriorated in
  the last few years. With Reuters and Associated Press
