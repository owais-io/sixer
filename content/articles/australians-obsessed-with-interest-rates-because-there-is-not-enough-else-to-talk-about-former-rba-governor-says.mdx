  Australians are obsessed with interest rates because “there’s not enough else
  to talk about”, says the former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens. Stevens,
  now chair of Macquarie Group, raised the ire of the Howard government when the
  independent RBA lifted its cash rate target only a few weeks before the 2007
  election, which was won comfortably by Kevin Rudd. But Stevens told an RBA
  historian in newly released material as part of the central bank’s oral
  history project he still didn’t “really have a good answer” for why interest
  rates are “such a topic of political discussion in Australia”. “I think the
  problem is there’s not enough else to talk about seriously,” he said. “The UK
  has floating rate mortgages too and interest rates are a topic of discussion
  there politically, but so is the Middle East and a bunch of other stuff that
  the UK, as a bigger country, is sort of involved in; and of course, in America
  there’s so many other things to talk about. “But here, in little old
  Australia, what are we going to amuse ourselves with? We’ve got a lot of media
  capacity and not enough real news to fill it. That used to be my answer anyway
  – and I still don’t have a better one.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Stevens, a reluctant public figure during his 10-year stint in the top job
  ending in 2016, was the occasional target of bruising tabloid criticism, most
  memorably when interest rate rises led Sydney’s Daily Telegraph to describe
  him as “the most useless banker in Australia”. Reserve Bank officials have
  consistently maintained that interest rates are not to blame for chronically
  unaffordable housing, with homes averaging $1.5m in Sydney and only 14% of
  properties for sale nationally affordable for a household on the median
  income. But in his interview, conducted in February 2024, Stevens said fears
  of supercharging asset prices through the 2010s played a pivotal role in the
  decision not to follow the example of many overseas countries and push the
  cash rate to zero, despite inflation staying consistently below the RBA’s 2%
  to 3% target range. “I thought about it a lot, a lot,” he said. “I think the
  evidence of the past, the period really since the Japan bubble burst, through
  the GFC, and even into the last couple of years, has yet again demonstrated
  that asset valuations, leverage and movements in those things are very
  important.” Stevens argued that while “we know roughly” that inflation should
  be around two-point-something, there is no equivalent idea for where asset
  prices should be. “With asset values, what’s the right value of the ASX 200?
  It all depends; what’s too big a rise or fall in that price over a year?
  “Property prices are a bit the same. It can be problematic but it’s harder to
  pin down what the correct number is, so you wouldn’t make it a target I don’t
  think, but you can’t ignore it.” All five of the governors and deputy
  governors interviewed by the bank’s historian agreed that the inflation target
  had broadly served Australia well. In a separate interview, Stephen Grenville,
  who held the No 2 job at the RBA in the five years to 2001, said: “We had two
  decades where it worked well and one decade where, in my view, it didn’t work
  so well. “It worked well until 2010 – [the post-global financial crisis]
  period − and I think it showed its great virtues.” Grenville said there was
  evidence that the impact of monetary policy had been exhausted and that
  interest rate reductions were pumping up asset prices but doing little to spur
  the economy. “I think that’s an unresolved issue of the inflation targeting
  framework; [it encourages policymakers to go on reducing interest rates
  whenever inflation is too low],” the RBA’s transcript of the interview shows.
  “I don’t think it actually mattered that inflation was running at 1.5% − we
  weren’t deflating, so we could have just not worried about it − but because
  you’ve signed on so rigorously to inflation targeting, it’s very hard to say,
  ‘Oh look, conditions are a bit different now, 1.5 is OK, isn’t it?’”
