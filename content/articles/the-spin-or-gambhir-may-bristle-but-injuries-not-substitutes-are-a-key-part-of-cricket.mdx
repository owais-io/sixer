  I’ll be honest, I’m done in. Not feeling it. Quills deep in the red zone. This
  white blank page looks impossibly foreboding. I feel like I’m blinking up at a
  vast Eiger-shaped word document. Nine hundred words of Garamond from the
  summit and my crampons are made of blancmange. You think these Spin columns
  are easy? I had four days in bed after the last one. I need to get out of
  this. I’ve been called up, but now it’s plain to see it’s not working. Should
  I claim Scrivener’s palsy? The yips? Desperately and repeatedly slam the
  laptop lid on my knuckles? Channel Allan Border to Dean Jones at Chennai in
  1986? “Let’s get a proper cricket writer out here. A southerner.” Andy Bull.
  Tanya Aldred. Let’s be ’avin you! But sometimes you have just got to get on
  with it. Deal with the situation you’re given. Ben Stokes has not made it easy
  to get on board with all of his words and deeds at the end of the drawn Old
  Trafford Test, but on the issue of cricketing substitutions, well, I’ll snatch
  his hand off. He described the prospect as “absolutely ridiculous” and that
  “there would be just too many loopholes”. Injury replacements are due to be
  trialled by some boards at first-class level this year. Stokes – who will miss
  the final Test himself because of a shoulder injury – went on to state that
  the conversation should be “shut down and stopped”. England’s captain once
  again flying in the face of soft power and showing his interventionist
  tendencies. Naturally, as befits the Test series, India’s coach, Gautam
  Gambhir, took the opposite view. With Rishabh Pant’s fractured foot no doubt
  fresh in his mind Gambhir said an injury replacement should be allowed in such
  a scenario. Under the existing laws of the game, India’s reserve wicketkeeper
  Dhruv Jurel was allowed to replace Pant behind the stumps but not permitted to
  bat. Gambhir’s take is a surprising one. He is known for being tough and
  uncompromising as a player and a coach, instilling a Stakhanovite work ethic
  and training regime into his players and, as befits a man with such luxuriant
  Victorian sideburns, he seems to bristle at the merest whiff of weakness.
  Gambhir seems to bristle at almost anything; he has the air of a bloke for
  whom the entire universe is a perceived slight. The guy has got
  resting-death-stare-face, appearing permanently close to putting up his dukes
  and offering people outside. But on the issue of subs Gambhir has gone soft.
  Injuries are part of the game, they are bad luck and no one wants to see them,
  they can leave a side staring down the barrel of a significant disadvantage.
  James Anderson pulling up lame on the first morning of the 2019 Ashes left
  England a bowler short for almost the whole game. Nathan Lyon suffering a
  mid-game crooked calf at Lord’s four years later left Australia faced with the
  task of bowling England out without their premier spinner. (Reader, they
  managed it.) As anyone who has played or watched cricket for any length of
  time knows, the game has a way of levelling things out. It is a lesson learned
  by all amateur cricketers – call it mother cricket, call it reverse-swings and
  roundabouts, call it a peculiar case of oscillating cricketing equilibrium.
  You get away with one this week, you will get a stinker the next. That is just
  the way it goes. The fine balance between success and failure is baked in, it
  is all part of cricket’s beguiling and maddening alchemy. It is not just
  Stokes and Gambhir that disagree on injury replacements, former players and
  pundits are split down the middle. The former England captain Michael Vaughan
  is in favour, decrying the current ruling as being akin to something from the
  dark ages. Steven Finn was firmly against, posting on X about the fine balance
  and arm wrestling nature of Test cricket: “The game is played over five days
  for a reason. (Some) teams bat long in order to wear a bowling unit down. If
  you could substitute a fresh bowler in because of injury it would just be
  wrong. How on earth do you determine what an injury is? MRI scanners at every
  ground to check a muscle tear?” The cricketing world is increasingly one of
  hot takes and hypocrisy. Do we really want to go down the route of debating
  what constitutes an injury worthy of replacement, endlessly debating how it
  originated in an increasingly gruelling sport where nearly all players are
  constantly carrying something? As Stokes said: “If you stick me in an MRI
  scanner, I could get someone else in straight away.” The ensuing debates would
  be as endless and grim as those around the spirit of cricket and the
  impossibly spurious “line”. I can see the demands to see medical records now:
  “Call that a grade-three tear? Pah. This is a grade-three tear.” An Ashes tour
  in four years with Brydon Carse having to swat away accusations that the
  battered and bruised digit poking out of the hole in his boot was a
  prosthesis. Cue “Fake toe! FAKE TOE!” splashed on the front of the
  Courier-Mail. An exaggeration? Perhaps. Test cricket has constantly changed
  and adapted to the world around it, but in this day and age that might not be
  the best thing. Injuries are a part of the game, players battle through,
  sometimes they fade away, sometimes they come back stronger. As India and this
  column prove, despite the hand you are dealt, you can still get over the line.
