  Four years after her three life-changing weeks in New York, Emma Raducanu
  overcame a significant mental hurdle as she secured her first victory at the
  US Open since her 2021 title run in impressive fashion, dismantling the
  qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2 to finally return to the second round. After
  painful first-round defeats by Alizé Cornet and Sofia Kenin, plus a withdrawal
  in 2023 during an eight-month injury layoff, Raducanu showed her growth and
  newfound self-assurance by putting together a solid, clean performance against
  an inferior opponent. “It has been on my mind,” Raducanu said of her inability
  to win a match in New York. “It’s been four years, and it’s a very special
  tournament for me. I did feel different coming into it this year. I felt like
  I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it’s in the back of your
  head. So I’m just very pleased to have overcome that.” With the victory, the
  British No 1 is now 20-4 against lower-ranked players over the past year and
  her ability to consistently win favourable match-ups has been a key part of
  her steady rise up the rankings. She will next face either the 24th seed,
  Veronika Kudermetova, or Janice Tjen, a qualifier. It also signified a
  confidence-building first grand slam victory alongside her new Spanish coach,
  Francisco Roig, who again offered his charge a constant stream of positive
  reinforcement from a corner of Louis Armstrong Stadium. Roig was joined in
  Raducanu’s player box by Jerome Poupel, a chiropractor who has been helping
  Raducanu with her continued back injury. “He’s been helping me for the last
  year, I would say. I’ve had back problems for the last year, so he’s just
  really helped with that,” Raducanu said. “As I’ve been playing more tennis and
  training more, it’s just important for me to stay on top of that. It’s cool,
  you know, he’s worked in F1, he’s worked with horses, so it’s very different.
  But I’m just enjoying having him around. He’s a great, calm but eccentric kind
  of character.” During their time working together, Poupel has offered Raducanu
  unique insights on her character. “He said that my character is similar to a
  horse,” she said. “Can be quite stubborn, dig their heels in. He’s got
  experience. Hopefully he can read me. And also they kind of wear their emotion
  on their sleeve. “If they’re not feeling like they want to do something they
  probably won’t do it. I’m just happy to have him around. He’s got so much
  different, diverse experience that it’s great to have that insight.” This was
  a good first-round draw for Raducanu, but Shibahara is an interesting figure
  in her own right. An American-born Japanese player, the 27-year-old is a
  former top four doubles player and the 2022 French Open mixed doubles
  champion. Shibahara only opted to prioritise singles last year and she has
  performed admirably, rising from outside the top 500 to her current ranking of
  No 128. However, she has never defeated a top-50 opponent and this contest
  marked just the second grand slam main draw appearance of her career. From the
  beginning, Raducanu set the tone with a calming hold to love. As she rolled
  through the match, she found a nice balance between imposing herself with her
  early ball striking and remaining solid against an erratic opponent who
  finished the match with 36 unforced errors. While Raducanu once spent a
  significant amount of time scouting opponents, she puts part of her success
  down to finding solutions within herself. “I like watching the opponents,”
  Raducanu said. “I think I’m probably watching less now. I just have a good
  awareness of the opponent, what they like to do, and a lot more centred around
  me. I think I’m trusting myself, trusting my own abilities a lot more and I
  know what I need to do on the court as well, not necessarily searching so much
  to the box, asking for what to do, only if I feel like I really need it. I
  think that’s helped me keep my head in the match, rather than looking up,
  getting distracted, and kind of searching for something.” Before the
  tournament, Raducanu spoke in depth about how the US Open has generated
  conflicting emotions for her over the years. Her first‑round defeat against
  Kenin last year was a particularly low point, and Raducanu broke down in tears
  during her post-match press conference. Things are clearly different now. This
  summer Raducanu has become a more match tough and confident player than at any
  point in the past four years. Now she will try to turn that conviction and
  contentment into another positive run in New York.
