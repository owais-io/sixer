  US president Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing tariffs
  ranging from 10% to 41% on imports from dozens of trade partners in his latest
  attempt to reshape the global economy. However, in a minor reprieve that opens
  the door to further negotiations, the White House said these measures will
  take effect in a week, not Friday, the deadline previously set by Trump. The
  new rates, which Trump sees as benefiting US exporters, unleash a fresh round
  of uncertainty for dozens of countries, including longtime US allies. It has
  also raised fears of inflation in the US. Rates were set at 25% for India’s
  US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa. Switzerland faces a
  rate of 39%. The deadline for a tariff deal with Mexico was extended by
  another 90 days. Brazil’s tariff rate was set at 10%, but a previous order
  signed by Trump placed a 40% tariff on some Brazilian goods, to punish the
  country for prosecuting its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to
  overturn an election he lost and inspiring his supporters to storm the seat of
  government. Separately, the White House announced that Canadian imports will
  face tariffs of 35%, not the current 25%. The order stated that Canada had
  “failed to cooperate” in curbing fentanyl flows into the US. Trump had
  threatened on Wednesday that Ottawa’s move to recognise a Palestinian state
  would make agreeing a trade deal “very hard”. Some of the world’s poorest and
  most war-torn countries were hit with punitive rates, including Syria, which
  faces a levy of 41%; Laos and Myanmar with rates of 40%; Libya with a rate of
  30%; Iraq with 35% and Sri Lanka with 20%. The small African country Lesotho
  received a modified tariff rate of 15% – it had been left reeling in April by
  the threat of a 50% rate, the highest of any US trading partner. Trump’s
  initial tariff announcement three months ago sparked a market sell-off but
  this time reaction was more muted. Stocks and equity futures fell modestly in
  Friday morning trading in Asia. The rates on 68 countries and the 27-member
  European Union are set to go into effect in seven days, according to the
  order, and not the Friday deadline that the president initially set. The
  extension reflects the government’s need for more time to harmonize the tariff
  rates, according to a senior official who spoke to reporters on condition of
  anonymity. Trump said the new tariffs were going “very well, very smooth.” In
  an interview with NBC News he added that it was “too late” for the countries
  named in Thursday’s order to avoid the tariff rates but that he was open to
  offers. “It doesn’t mean that somebody doesn’t come along in four weeks and
  say we can make some kind of a deal.” The latest tariffs salvo came amid legal
  challenges against Trump’s use of emergency economic powers. After a lower
  court said the president exceeded his authority, the US Court of Appeals heard
  arguments on Thursday in cases against Trump’s blanket tariffs targeting
  different countries. Earlier, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said
  countries that have not received a prior letter on tariffs from Trump or
  negotiated a trade framework would be notified of their likely tariff rates,
  either in the form of a letter or Trump’s executive order. Some of the
  countries listed had reached tariff-reducing deals, such as Pakistan, which
  faces levies of 19%, while others had no opportunity to negotiate with the
  Trump administration. Nations not listed in the order will face a baseline 10%
  tariff, the administration said. China faces a separate deadline for its
  higher tariffs of 12 August, with an extension to the truce agreed in
  principle but yet to be approved by the White House. Taiwan’s President Lai
  Ching-te described the tariff for his country as “temporary” and said there
  was “the possibility of further reductions should an agreement be reached”.
  The government would “strive for a reasonable tariff rate”, he added in a
  Facebook post. Thailand meanwhile welcomed its 19% levy as a “major success”.
  “It represents a win-win approach aimed at preserving Thailand’s export base
  and long-term economic stability,” government spokesman Jirayu Huangsab said
  in a statement. The US president said he had made the decision to offer more
  time to Mexico because of the complexities of the trading relationship. He
  wrote on social media: “We will be talking to Mexico over the next 90 Days
  with the goal of signing a Trade Deal somewhere within the 90 Day period of
  time, or longer.” The extension avoids a 30% tariff on most Mexican
  non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada
  Agreement on trade and came after a Thursday morning call between Trump and
  Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum. “We avoided the tariff increase announced
  for tomorrow,” Sheinbaum wrote in an X social media post, adding that the
  Trump call was “very good”. Mexico’s rate will now continue at 25% for another
  90 days. A little more than two weeks ago Trump threatened the EU and Mexico
  with tariffs of 30% on most exports to the US from 1 August, but last Sunday
  he concluded a deal with Brussels with a 15% baseline rate from 1 August. The
  extension for Mexico may fuel more mockery that “Trump always chickens out” of
  his own deadlines, but after strong-arming leading economies including the EU
  and Japan into punitive tariff deals his threatening strategy seems to be
  paying off. A US official told reporters that more trade deals were yet to be
  announced. “We have some deals,” the official said. “And I don’t want to get
  ahead of the President of the United States in announcing those deals.” When
  Trump announced what he called “liberation day” on 2 April, he said he would
  impose punitive “reciprocal” tariffs on trading partners across the world in
  retribution for what he described as years of looting, pillaging and
  scavenging of the US. By 31 July just eight countries or economic blocs had
  reached formal agreements with the White House: the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia,
  Philippines, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan and the EU. Australia’s trade
  minister, Don Farrell, said on Friday the White House had confirmed that no
  country had reciprocal tariffs lower than Australia, suggesting Trump had left
  the 10% baseline tariffs on Australian goods unchanged. Australia last week
  eased restrictions on beef imports from the US, potentially smoothing trade
  talks with Trump, although prime minister Anthony Albanese said the decision
  had long been considered and was not related to any trade negotiations.
  Cambodia and Thailand were also in reach of a deal, according to the commerce
  secretary, Howard Lutnick, earlier this week. However they both appeared on
  Thursday’s executive order with rates set at 19%. Cambodian prime minister Hun
  Manet described the rate in a Facebook post as “good news”. With agencies
