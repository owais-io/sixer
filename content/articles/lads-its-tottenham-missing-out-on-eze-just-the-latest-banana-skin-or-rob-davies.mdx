  Earlier this month, my Spurs WhatsApp group was debating whether, if you could
  only have one, you’d sign Eberechi Eze or Savinho. Ever the ray of sunshine, I
  confessed that my “gut feeling” was that we wouldn’t get either. A few days
  later, I doubled down. Despite reports suggesting Eze was practically on the
  149 bus heading for N17, I had the nagging sense that Arsenal might gazump us
  at the last minute. The reason for such a grim forecast was that I’d seen this
  tragi-comic movie before. Spurs have “nearly” signed everyone from Jean-Pierre
  Papin to Eden Hazard to Rivaldo, who famously wrote to Glenn Hoddle outlining
  why he’d inexplicably chosen San Siro over White Hart Lane. All clubs miss out
  on transfers from time to time. My pessimism sprang from somewhere else,
  somewhere darker and more psychologically deep-rooted. Supporting Tottenham
  Hotspur so often means imagining the most ludicrous, embarrassing thing that
  could possibly befall the club and then knowing, with crystal clarity, that
  it’s going to happen. Fans of other clubs – Wimbledon, Bury or Morecambe –
  have had it much worse, but no other club so expertly combines the slapstick
  and the high-profile. At Tottenham we wait until everyone is watching, then we
  slip on the banana skin. Think missing out on the Champions League because of
  a dodgy lasagne, or blowing a 2-0 lead in a European tie to a team whose
  manager is in prison. Think the famous “Lads, it’s Tottenham” game, which
  warped my expectations of football – and indeed life – as an 18-year-old in
  the stands in growing horror. Far from breaking the curse, the Europa League
  triumph seems merely to have angered the footballing gods, who swiftly set
  about restoring the karmic balance via the Morgan Gibbs-White debacle, the
  heartbreaking injury to James Maddison, and now this. Missing out on Eze is a
  worthy addition to the pantheon of pratfalls, although not necessarily because
  of the player himself. A fine footballer he may be, but Eze isn’t necessarily
  the right fit for the gap left by Maddison’s injury. Right now, Spurs badly
  lack passing ability and there are better candidates who are younger, cheaper
  and have a higher ceiling than Eze. No, there are two reasons this one will
  stick in the collective psyche of Spurs fans. The first, of course, is that
  we’ve been done over by that lot up the road, who appear to have been
  stealthily plotting for weeks, even as details of our haggling over add-ons
  and chairman-to-chairman talks played out in public. Arsenal fans won’t tire
  of reminding us about this all season; in the office, the pub and in the
  ground. More than that, though, this episode encapsulates the reign of Daniel
  Levy in microcosm. While rivals act decisively, we dither in the hope of a
  better deal, then miss out entirely. We spend but not quite enough, unwisely,
  or at the wrong time. We are all mouth – Levy says he wants to win the Premier
  League and Champions League – and no trousers. When it comes to transfers, the
  failure of Levy-era Tottenham to match his supposed ambition does not even
  have in it, to paraphrase the great Bill Nicholson, an echo of glory. Rather
  it is an echo of incompetence. Nobody can argue with what Levy has achieved,
  delivering state-of-the-art facilities, a world-leading stadium and a regular
  place – albeit a fragile one – at football’s top table. For all the vitriol
  that is aimed at Levy, many of us are grateful for what he has done. But Levy
  is like a man who spends thousands of pounds tricking out a car that he never
  takes out of the garage because of the price of petrol. What was the point if
  you’re not going to test what it can do? There remain many reasons to be
  optimistic about this season. Tottenham have a tactically astute new manager,
  taking charge of a squad that is both young and underrated after last year’s
  freakshow. The scouting set-up and club administration have been
  professionalised, putting Tottenham on a good footing for the future. Yet, as
  long as the clownish blunders continue, the calls will grow louder for Levy to
  step aside, to find a new steward for Spurs, one who refuses to allow the club
  and its fans to be the butt of every joke. The game, after all, is supposed to
  be about glory.
