  A “freeze” in the war in Ukraine may be close, the Polish prime minister said
  on Friday, as the White House and the Kremlin push forward with discussions
  for a high-level summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in the coming
  days. Donald Tusk’s remarks came after he spoke with the Ukrainian leader,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has communicated with Trump and European leaders in
  recent days as the White House continues to try to broker an end to the
  three-and-a-half-year war. “There are certain signals, and we also have an
  intuition, that perhaps a freeze in the conflict – I don’t want to say the
  end, but a freeze in the conflict – is closer than it is further away,” Tusk
  said during a news conference. “There are hopes for this.” Tusk said Zelenskyy
  was “very cautious but optimistic” about the ceasefire, Reuters reported.
  Ukraine was keen that Poland and other European countries play a role in
  planning for a ceasefire and an eventual peace settlement, Tusk said. Trump
  has said he is willing to meet Putin one on one without preconditions,
  including direct negotiations between Putin and Zelenskyy, stoking fears that
  Ukraine may be left out of negotiations for the framework of a potential
  ceasefire. Bloomberg reported on Friday that the deal could cement some of
  Putin’s territorial gains in Ukraine, effectively freezing the battle lines in
  the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions
  in their entirety, although much of their territory remains under Ukrainian
  control. US and Russian officials were working on a deal under which Russia
  would halt its offensive in exchange for the territorial concessions – making
  it a politically fraught proposal in Ukraine, Bloomberg said. Zelenskyy has
  responded by speaking with European leaders including the German chancellor,
  Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who are key
  conduits to Trump. Fox News reported on Friday that the meeting could take
  place at the end of next week. Potential venues include Switzerland, Rome,
  Hungary and the United Arab Emirates, the conservative outlet said.
  Switzerland and Italy are parties to the international criminal court (ICC),
  which has issued an arrest warrant for Putin, and their law enforcement would
  theoretically be required to detain the Russian president. Hungary’s Viktor
  Orbán announced plans to withdraw from the ICC earlier this year. Speaking to
  reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said Putin did not have to
  meet Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents could meet. “No, he
  doesn’t,” Trump said. “They would like to meet with me and I’ll do whatever I
  can to stop the killing.” Putin said he was not ready to meet Zelenskyy, even
  as the Kremlin claimed preparations were under way for a bilateral summit with
  Trump next week. “I have nothing against it in general, it is possible, but
  certain conditions must be created for this,” Putin said of a meeting with
  Zelenskyy. “But unfortunately, we are still far from creating such
  conditions.” The US envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed a three-way meeting with
  Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy but the Kremlin had ignored that suggestion, said
  the Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, and was “focusing on preparations for a bilateral
  meeting with Trump in the first place”. No venue has been set for the
  potential summit but Putin did mention that Dubai in the UAE was a possibility
  during a meeting with its leader, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. In the
  past 48 hours, White House officials have offered conflicting statements about
  whether Trump would agree to meet Putin. Witkoff, a close friend of Trump’s,
  is seen as a strong proponent of the meeting and had proposed it to Putin this
  week, while the national security adviser and secretary of state, Marco Rubio,
  later said that “a lot has to happen before [a summit] can occur”. The wide
  gamut of foreign policy views in the administration, which includes JD Vance’s
  scepticism of Ukraine and belief that the US should turn its focus away from
  Europe toward more pressing threats such as China, has helped its approach
  appear haphazard, while Trump’s Oval Office comments suggest that the
  administration is still interested in holding a summit. Last month, Trump
  issued an ultimatum for Putin to agree to a ceasefire or face secondary
  sanctions with the deadline set for this Friday. That deadline appeared in
  place despite plans for the summit, although the White House has not said what
  secondary measures it could enforce. Trump did target India with a 25% tariff
  hike for purchasing Russian oil this week, singling out one of Moscow’s
  economic enablers in a move that New Delhi complained was unfair and
  selective. Trump had grown frustrated with Putin in public in recent months as
  the war dragged through its third year and Putin continued to launch nightly
  missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities despite Trump’s insistence that
  he could strike a deal within 24 hours of becoming president. “Putin … talks
  nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said last month. “So
  there’s a little bit of a problem there.” Asked on Thursday whether the
  deadline still applied, Trump said: “It’s gonna be up to him. We’re going to
  see what he has to say. It’s gonna be up to him. Very disappointed.” Trump
  last week also announced that he would reposition nuclear submarines in
  response to a social media post by Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev,
  who said that Trump was “playing the ultimatum game with Russia” and had taken
  a “step toward war”.
