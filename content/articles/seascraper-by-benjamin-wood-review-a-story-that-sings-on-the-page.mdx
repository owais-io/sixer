  You don’t think you need a novella about a folk-singing shrimp fisher living
  with his mother on a fictional stretch of isolated coast until you read
  Benjamin Wood’s Booker-longlisted fifth novel, Seascraper. Wood conjures
  wonders from this unlikely material in a tale so richly atmospheric you can
  almost taste the tang of brine and inhale the sea fog. As unexpected as his
  previous four books – which range from a campus intrigue (The Bellwether
  Revivals) to a sensitive study of a Glaswegian painter (The Ecliptic) –
  Seascraper follows the daily trials of Tom Flett, a “shanker” who scrapes the
  sand for its yield at low tide with his trusty horse and wagon, risking his
  life in a job that is simultaneously boring and dangerous. Tom is clearly in
  the Hardyesque tradition of unworldly young men who tend the land or work with
  their hands (Gabriel Oak, Jude Fawley), and it’s this that alerts us to his
  vulnerability to charmers and chancers. Apprenticed by his pop at 14 (“every
  other Flett had been a shrimper, going back to his great-grandpa”), Tom
  nevertheless longs for a life less circumscribed. He yearns to perform
  folksongs in the local pubs and court local girl Joan, but lacks the courage
  for both. An avid reader, he has swallowed “half a library” at a young age,
  yet finds himself tied to a job that gives him little fulfilment. Meanwhile,
  his widowed mother entertains gentleman suitors in the front room, perching on
  the sofa in her best clothes. When the latest suitor turns out to be a slick
  American film director named Edgar Acheson, Tom sees his chance of escape.
  Edgar is scouting locations for a movie adaptation and immediately looks to
  recruit Tom as his local guide, “a guy who knows the beach, the tides”. Tom
  agrees at once, though acutely aware of his antisocial stink of “pervasive
  sweat and shrimp rot, fish guts, crab flesh, seaweed, dander, forage, gull
  shit, horse dung”. The two form a fast friendship, with Tom warning his
  exuberant employer of the treacherous sinkholes that open up on the beach,
  deep enough to swallow a horse and drag you down after it. It’s this mortal
  danger that ramps up the tension for the book’s long and surreal central
  section where Tom and Edgar set out to recce the beach at night. What makes
  Wood’s writing such a pleasure is his attentiveness to the prosaic details of
  everyday life. Whether it’s harnessing a horse, cooking a fry-up or tuning a
  guitar, he transforms the quotidian into the poetic, making the exactitude of
  each task sing on the page. The book is full of visceral and evocative
  descriptions of the natural world, “the festering scent of bladderwrack … a
  strange, spasmodic crunch each time the wheels pass over razor shells and
  gnarls of driftwood … undulating sand that gives beneath the wheels as readily
  as butter”. He’s equally adept at creating warm and believable characters
  whose deep humanity makes you want to spend time in their company. Inevitably,
  Edgar isn’t all he purports to be, leading Tom back to his first love, music,
  as he composes a ballad to woo Joan. This precipitates an epiphany about the
  power of art: “A song, though – well, a song belongs to someone. To whoever
  dreamed it up.” In this sense, he achieves his dreams without turning his back
  on tradition, and much of the book is concerned with the tension between
  long-established ways of living and the insistent klaxon of modernity,
  embodied by Edgar, along with new technologies and their attendant ills. Early
  on, Tom notes that there is “all sorts in the water now that wasn’t there when
  he was just a lad. Strange chemicals and pesticides and sewage.” He also
  observes that “there’s more profit to be made using motor rigs and shrimping
  further down the coast”. While some of the dialogue veers close to folksy, and
  Edgar is straight from central casting, there’s a clarity of observation and
  lack of sentimentality that raises the book from a simple tale of unfulfilled
  lives and nostalgia for a vanished past. The short form feels Conradian,
  lending a welcome density and brevity – apt for a protagonist grappling with
  physical adversity and inner turmoil. Seascraper sees Wood join the ranks of
  adventurous mid-career British novelists such as Barney Norris and Ben Myers;
  all three are treading a singular path with unfashionable yet heartfelt
  accounts of lives that long for a wider horizon. • Seascraper by Benjamin Wood
  is published by Viking (£14.99). To support the Guardian order your copy at
