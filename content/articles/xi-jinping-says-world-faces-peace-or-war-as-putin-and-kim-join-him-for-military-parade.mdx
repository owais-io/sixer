  Xi Jinping said the world was facing a choice between peace or war as he held
  China’s largest-ever military parade, joined by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un
  in a show of defiance to the west. Putin and Kim, the authoritarian leaders of
  Russia and North Korea, were among dozens of world leaders who attended the
  parade, a massive display of military hardware and personnel, orchestrated to
  mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China
  calls the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression. “Today, humanity is
  again faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation,
  win-win or zero-sum,” Xi told the crowd of more than 50,000 spectators, adding
  that the Chinese people “firmly stand on the right side of history”. He said
  China was a great nation that “is never intimidated by any bullies” in an
  apparent veiled reference to the US and its allies and warned that China was
  “unstoppable”. After his remarks, Xi stood in an open top car to inspect the
  parade, greeting troops and receiving salutes, as miles of military hardware
  drove by and warplanes flew overhead. The event bookended a week of diplomatic
  grandstanding in China, with Xi hosting dozens of leaders in Tianjin, in a
  push to elevate groups dominated by the global south – and led by China – over
  western-led groups such as Nato. The years-long campaign has been aided by US
  president Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and volatile policymaking which has
  strained its relations with allies and rivals alike. But it was the
  unprecedented image of the three autocratic strongmen chatting and shaking
  hands as they walked the red carpet in Tiananmen Square on Wednesday, that
  analysts said sent the strongest message of defiance to the west. “Beijing is
  sending a message … that even if western countries continue to sanction Russia
  over the Russia-Ukraine war, Beijing will not be afraid to stand by its
  friend,” said Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s
  Global China Hub. China has touted the parade as a show of unity with other
  countries, and Kim’s attendance is the first time he has been seen with Xi and
  Putin at the same event. It is only Kim’s second reported trip abroad in six
  years. The event drew an almost immediate reaction from Trump. “May President
  Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of
  celebration,” Trump posted on his Truth Social account. “Please give my
  warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-un, as you conspire against
  The United States of America.” Just hours after the parade, officials reported
  that Kim and Putin had held a formal meeting, in which Kim said he was willing
  to do “everything I can to assist” Russia, describing it as a “fraternal
  duty”, according to Russian state media. According to South Korean
  assessments, North Korea has sent about 15,000 troops to Russia since they
  signed an agreement last year. Putin reportedly thanked Kim for the bravery
  and heroism of North Korean soldiers who fought alongside Moscow’s troops.
  Putin’s appearance in Beijing came as Russia launched a sweeping overnight air
  attack on Ukraine, injuring at least four railway workers and prompting Poland
  to scramble defence aircraft. Among the other guests in China are the Iranian
  president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and the Myanmar junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing. No
  major western leaders are attending. Kim has been accompanied by his daughter
  Kim Ju-ae, images released by North Korean state news showed. Analysts are
  watching closely to see if any formal meeting between Xi, Putin and Kim is
  held. “If all three were to meet, it would be very striking to the United
  States, highlighting a potential new cold war dynamic,” said Lim Chuan-Tiong,
  a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University
  of Tokyo. “If such a meeting does not take place, it is likely because China
  does not want to overly provoke the US while maintaining a certain degree of
  triangular ambiguity.” Analysts made much of the military hardware on display;
  from tanks and drones to long-range and nuclear capable missiles, fighter jets
  and stealth aircraft, with several newly developed assets unveiled. The
  hardware is intended to “give the United States, Europe and China’s neighbours
  pause should they consider challenging China’s core national interests”, said
  Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International
  Studies in Singapore Some of the weaponry being shown to the public for the
  first time included hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea,
  according to Chinese military officials. These weapons are of particular
  concern to the US navy, which patrols the western Pacific. Also on display
  were underwater drones including the AJX002 and a new intercontinental
  ballistic missile, the DF-61, which China says could carry nuclear warheads to
  distant targets. Jennifer Parker, adjunct fellow in naval studies at UNSW
  Canberra, said the parade was more about China sending a specific message than
  signalling new capabilities. “You don’t do a parade like this to commemorate
  the end of world war two. You do a parade like this to show force, and you are
  choosing the capabilities that you put into that parade to send a specific
  message,” she said. “What they’re trying to show is a conventional and nuclear
  force that can operate across all domains and with cutting edge technology.”
  Xi’s speech contained several references to the “rejuvenation of the Chinese
  nation” – a common phrase for Xi’s overarching plan for China’s future which
  hinges on annexing Taiwan as Chinese territory. Xi and the Chinese Communist
  party claim Taiwan is a Chinese province, currently run by illegal
  separatists. Taiwan’s government and people are opposed to this. The People’s
  Liberation Army has been undergoing a massive modernisation and advancement
  under Xi, but it’s also been beset by corruption issues, and in the last few
  years there have been purges of officials and personnel at levels not seen
  since the Mao Zedong era. Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Daisy
