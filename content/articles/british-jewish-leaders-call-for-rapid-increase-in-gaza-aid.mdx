  The UK’s largest Jewish organisation has called for a “rapid, uninhibited, and
  sustained increase in aid through all available channels” in Gaza in a rare
  implicit criticism of the Israeli government. The Board of Deputies held an
  emergency meeting on Tuesday evening amid growing horror among British Jews at
  the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with children malnourished and starving and
  desperate parents being killed as they try to secure food for their families.
  In a statement issued after the meeting, Phil Rosenberg, the board’s
  president, said the Israeli government’s recent moves to allow limited aid
  into Gaza in response to mounting international pressure was “long overdue”.
  He said: “The suffering we are witnessing in the Gaza Strip demands a
  response. The new measures announced by Israeli authorities to address the
  humanitarian crisis are essential if long overdue. “We need to see a rapid,
  uninhibited, and sustained increase in aid through all available channels, and
  we need to see all agencies cooperating in this endeavour. As we have been
  saying for months, food must not be used as a weapon of war, by any side in
  this conflict.” Rosenberg’s statement came a month after the board took
  disciplinary action against 36 elected representatives who signed an open
  letter that was strongly critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza. Five of the 36
  were suspended for two years. Before Tuesday’s emergency meeting, dozens of
  deputies had written to the board leadership saying it must appeal to the
  Israeli government to “end this suffering”. Their letter said: “Nothing could
  be more damaging to the British Jewish community than staying silent in this
  moment.” Last week, Marie van der Zyl, a former president of the board, wrote:
  “Hunger and human suffering, on this scale, are incompatible with the core
  values of our faith.” In an article in Jewish News, she called for “urgent
  action to alleviate the conditions affecting civilians in Gaza”. She added:
  “This is not a time for silence. It is a time for compassion.” More than 400
  rabbis from around the world, including Jonathan Wittenberg, the leader of
  Masorti Jews in the UK, and other leading UK rabbis, called on the Israeli
  government to cease its “callous indifference to starvation”. Their letter
  warned that “the Jewish people face a grave moral crisis”, adding: “We cannot
  condone the mass killings of civilians, including a great many women,
  children, and elderly, or the use of starvation as a weapon of war.” Under the
  headline “Jewish moral clarity means saying: Enough”, an editorial last week
  in the Jewish News, one of the two main Jewish news outlets in the UK, said
  the war in Gaza must end now. The co-leaders of Progressive Judaism said in an
  open letter last Friday the “deepening humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza was
  “not in our name, and not in line with the Judaism we teach, live and pass
  on”. Rabbi Charley Baginsky and Rabbi Josh Levy said: “This is not just a
  political moment, it is a moral and religious one.” In his statement,
  Rosenberg said the board supported a two-state solution but the UK
  government’s plan to recognise a Palestinian state without a negotiated
  agreement “risks putting gestures ahead of substance”. The board’s “primary
  concern regarding the government’s announcement is to avoid empowering or
  rewarding Hamas, or giving it incentives to continue evading a ceasefire”. The
  statement added: “It is clear that our community overwhelmingly rejects the
  appalling rhetoric and unacceptable proposals from some Israeli ministers,
  particularly in relation to the forced displacement of Gazans, as well as the
  intolerable violence perpetrated by extremist settlers in the West Bank, all
  of which are in complete contradiction to our values.” The war in Gaza was
  taking a toll on Israeli citizens and the UK Jewish community, “including
  through the unacceptable proliferation of hatred and discrimination directed
  at Jews in this country”.
