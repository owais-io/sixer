  “A stranger arrives, makes love to everyone and then leaves,” said Pier Paolo
  Pasolini to Terence Stamp, outlining the plot of his 1968 classic Theorem.
  “That’s your part.” Stamp exclaimed: “I can play that.” It was the role that
  the man was born to play and would play, with subtle variations, throughout
  his career. From his first appearance as the eerily beautiful sailor in 1962’s
  Billy Budd through to his last manifestation as “the silver-haired gentleman”
  in Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho, Stamp remained a brilliantly,
  mesmerisingly unknowable presence. He was the seductive dark prince of British
  cinema, an actor who carried an air of elegant mystery. “As a boy I always
  believed I could make myself invisible,” he once said. He showed up and made
  magic, but he never stuck around for as long as we wanted. Stamp’s talent was
  timeless but he was a creature of the 60s, forged in the crucible of postwar
  social mobility and as much a poster boy for the era as his one-time flatmate
  Michael Caine. “Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station, every Friday night,” Ray
  Davies sang on the Kinks’s Waterloo Sunset and while he wasn’t necessarily
  singing about Stamp and Julie Christie – at least not consciously – the actors
  and the song have now become intertwined, part of a collective cultural
  fabric, to the point where that mental image of the two of them by the Thames
  is almost as much a part of Stamp’s showreel as his actual 60s pictures. He
  was born in London’s East End, the son of a tugboat coalman who regarded
  acting with horror, and his rough-hewn swagger lent a crucial grit and danger
  to his refined matinee idol aesthetic. He gave a superb performance – full of
  seething chippy rage – in 1965’s The Collector, a role that won him the best
  actor prize at Cannes, made an excellent dastardly lover in Far from the
  Madding Crowd and whipped up a storm in Federico Fellini’s uproarious Toby
  Dammit. But he was always a more febrile movie actor than his compatriots –
  Caine, Sean Connery, Richard Harris, Peter O’Toole – and so his career proved
  more fragile and never truly bedded down. “When the 60s ended, I almost did
  too,” he once said, ruefully acknowledging a decade-long slump that only came
  to an end when he was cast as General Zod in 1978’s Superman. In the
  subsequent years he played too many off-the-peg Brits – thuggish gangsters,
  evil businessmen – in subpar productions, although this only made his
  occasional great role feel all the more precious. Stamp was at his
  full-blooded best in Stephen Frears’s 80s crime drama The Hit, sparked briefly
  as the devil in The Company of Wolves and was fabulous as Bernadette in 1994’s
  Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. But his great later role – and arguably the
  ultimate Stamp performance – was in The Limey, Steven Soderbergh’s 1999
  revenge tale. Soderbergh cast him as Wilson, an ageing career criminal who
  haunts LA like a ghost. It’s a film that is implicitly about Stamp’s youth and
  age, beautifully folding the present-day drama in with scenes in Ken Loach’s
  Poor Cow to show what happened to the golden generation of swinging 60s London
  – and by implication, what happens to all of us. Somewhere along the way,
  wending his way up the coast to Big Sur, Stamp’s knackered criminal stops
  being a ghost and becomes a kind of living sculpture, a priceless piece of
  cinema history, returned for one last gig to seduce the world and set it
  spinning before heading off towards the sunset.
