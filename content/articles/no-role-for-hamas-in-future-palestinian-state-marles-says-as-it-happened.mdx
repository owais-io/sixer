  We’re going to wrap the blog up for today. Here are the day’s key events: The
  deputy prime minister Richard Marles repeated the government’s denials it does
  not supply weapons to Israel when appearing on the ABC’s Insiders on Sunday
  morning. The Greens foreign affairs spokesperson David Shoebridge responded
  saying the government was “actively choosing to continue the two-way arms
  trade with Israel” and “international law is crystal clear, parts of weapons
  are weapons”. Anthony Albanese and his New Zealand counterpart, Christopher
  Luxon, discussed the Middle East war and Israel’s plans to take control of
  more of Gaza in coming days. The PM said Australia would make its own
  decisions about recognising Palestinian statehood, likely ahead of the United
  Nations general assembly in New York next month. Albanese also said Ukraine’s
  president Volodymyr Zelenskyy must be a party to Donald Trump’s upcoming
  ceasefire talks with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The two leaders are set to talk
  about the invasion of Ukraine in Alaska this week. The Tasmanian premier
  Jeremy Rockliff announced the Tasmanian Liberals would phase out funding for
  greyhound racing by 2029 – effectively ending the sport in the state – in a
  bid to secure the support of crossbenchers in minority government. The NSW
  government released CCTV footage taken onboard the state’s light rail network
  of near-misses involving pedestrians, cars and cyclists. Thanks for joining
  us. Enjoy the rest of your weekend and we’ll see you again on Monday. The
  lethal legacy of Aukus For Australia’s proposed nuclear-powered submarine
  fleet there is, at present, nowhere for that radioactive spent fuel to go. As
  a non-nuclear country – and a party to the non-proliferation treaty –
  Australia has no history of, and no capacity for, managing high-level nuclear
  waste. But Australia is not alone, writes my colleague Ben Doherty: there is
  no operational site anywhere on Earth for the permanent storage of high-level
  nuclear waste. Read the full feature here: Australia’s central bank appears
  set to offer mortgage holders some repayment relief a month on from its shock
  decision to keep interest rates on hold, AAP reports. The Reserve Bank of
  Australia board, which meets on Monday and Tuesday, is widely tipped to shave
  25 basis points off the official cash rate, taking the figure to 3.6%. Each 25
  basis point cut to interest rates shaves about $90 off monthly repayments on a
  $600,000 mortgage, assuming banks pass on the reduction in full. The cash rate
  was last at 3.6% in April 2023. A surprise jump in unemployment combined with
  inflation data within the RBA’s target zone should make a cut on Tuesday
  almost inevitable, Westpac Group chief economist Luci Ellis said, adding:
  Further cuts in November, February 2026 and May 2026 also look increasingly
  likely. David Shoebridge, the Greens’ foreign affairs spokesperson, released a
  strong statement after Marles denied Australia is supplying weapons to Israel
  this morning. Shoebridge said two years of “hollow talking points from the
  Albanese government aren’t washing with the public anymore”, accusing the
  Labor government of “actively choosing to continue the two-way arms trade with
  Israel”. He went on: Watching defence minister Richard Marles refuse to answer
  basic questions about Australia’s export of weapons parts and defence material
  to Israel is excruciating … International law is crystal clear, parts of
  weapons are weapons. Germany has stopped weapons exports to Israel, so why on
  earth won’t Labor stop Australia sending them? Australia is a key part of the
  F35 fighter jet program. We are the only place in the world that makes parts
  like the bomb bay doors and we operate as one of the few regional distribution
  hubs. WA business lobby says more public holidays could cost more than $100m a
  year AAP reports that more public holidays in Western Australia could cost in
  excess of $100m a year, according to claims by the state’s business lobby. The
  WA government is taking submissions into the addition of two public holidays
  to its calendar. WA already has the second-fewest number of public holidays in
  the nation with 11, two behind Victoria and the ACT, which have 13. NSW and
  Queensland both have 11, Tasmania 10, while South Australia and the Northern
  Territory have 12 Adding two additional days off could cost employers $115.42m
  every year, calculations from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA
  indicate. A rise in public holiday wages for Easter Saturday would amount to
  $67.87m and the addition of an undecided weekday public holiday, $47.55m.
  Small and family-owned business would be hit hardest off the back of already
  increasing costs, the chamber claims. “It’s clear that WA businesses can’t
  afford another two days where they’re paying someone $65 an hour to wash
  dishes,” acting co-chief executive and chief economist Aaron Morey said.
  Environmental benefits of NSW Return and Earn scheme Around 14bn bottles and
  cans have been returned since Return and Earn scheme started in New South
  Wales, according to the organisation that coordinates the container deposit
  scheme. Exchange for Change said the milestone meant more than $1.4bn in
  container refunds had been issued since the scheme’s launch in December 2017.
  The organisation said the environmental benefits of returning 14bn bottles and
  cans for recycling instead of making new containers with virgin materials
  included: Water savings equivalent to 32,840 Olympic swimming pools Energy
  savings equivalent to powering 191,100 homes for an entire year Carbon
  emission savings equivalent to taking 1,017,400 cars off the road annually.
  They said an additional 3.8bn drink containers had been returned through
  yellow kerbside bin collections and two out of every three eligible drink
  containers supplied in NSW were recycled through the scheme. Guardian
  investigation appears to show Israeli pattern of firing on Palestinians
  seeking food A Guardian investigation analysing visual evidence, bullets,
  medical data and patterns of injuries from two hospitals, as well as
  interviews with medical organisations and surgeons, across approximately 50
  days of food distribution, appears to show a sustained Israeli pattern of
  firing on Palestinians seeking food. You can read the full investigation by
  Manisha Ganguly here: We reported in an earlier post that the NSW government
  had released footage taken from onboard the state’s light rail network of
  near-misses involving pedestrians, cyclists and motorists. Here is some of the
  footage taken from the Sydney light rail: Man overdue from Tasmanian hike
  found safe and well A man in his 60s has been rescued and is safe and well
  after he was reported overdue from a day hike in Tasmania late yesterday. The
  man was reported overdue from his walk just before 10:30pm. Tasmanian police
  said while the man’s exact walking plans weren’t known, police commenced a
  search of likely locations and overnight found his car in the carpark for a
  trail to Bradys Lookout, near Poatina in the Central Highlands. Police were
  able to contact the man this morning and a ground search and rescue team and
  the Westpac Rescue Helicopter were dispatched to locate him. He was found safe
  and well just before 9:30am. The defence minister, Richard Marles’ statements
  this morning on exports to Israel are contested. Marles told Insiders on ABC
  TV that there was “misinformation” around Australian exports in the context of
  the war in Gaza, and said “we are not supplying weapons to Israel”. He said
  Australia was one of the countries signed up to contribute armoured steel used
  in the F-35 stealth fighter aircraft. Israel has previously confirmed the
  planes were being used to bomb targets in Gaza, but Australian officials say
  the country is contributing to a “global supply chain” that is “directed by
  the United States”. The Greens and human rights campaigners have pointed to
  export supply chains from Australia, and called for anything that could be
  contributing to the ongoing war to be stopped. Guardian Australia reported in
  November that Australia had amended or lapsed at least 16 defence-related
  export permits to Israel. A spokesperson said all of the 16 permits were
  approved before the conflict began and none of the permits related to weapons
  or ammunition. The ABC reported in April that a remote weapon system designed
  and built by Australian company Electro Optic Systems was one of dozens of
  counter drone technologies tested by the Israel Defence Forces earlier this
  year. It cited a defence industry source claiming the Australian-made
  components were first sent to an entity connected to the company in the United
  States for assembly, before being shipped to Israel without an Australian
  export approval. The Australian Centre for International Justice, a non-profit
  legal centre, is among organisations questioning the government’s claims that
  Australia does not export weapons to Israel. Executive director Rawan Arraf
  said earlier this year that the government and Australian companies were
  “complicit” and called for the exports, including via third countries, to end.
  Greens senator David Shoebridge has also raised doubts about the government’s
  statements. He says Australia stopped arms trade with Russia due to its
  invasion of Ukraine and that the government should do the same with Israel.
  Marles says Australia is not supplying weapons to Israel. Is it true? Back on
  Marles, Guardian Australia looked at the government’s claims denying it
  supplies weapons to Israel last year when defence officials confirmed in
  Senate estimates Australian businesses continued to contribute to the supply
  chain for items used in F-35 aircraft and the Greens pressed officials to
  confirm F-35 fighters were being used to bomb targets in Gaza. You can read
  that fact check here. Australian officials insisted at the time Australia was
  contributing to a “global supply chain” that was “directed by the United
  States” and that they “can’t speak for the IDF and how it engages in force
  deployment”. That prompted Greens senator David Shoebridge to tell the Senate
  committee there was “a moral vacuum at the heart of our export weapons
  scheme”. In November last year, my colleague Sarah Basford-Canales also
  reported on at least 16 defence-related export permits to Israel that had
  either been amended or had lapsed. Footage shows near-misses on NSW light rail
  network The Minns government has released footage of near-misses on the NSW
  light rail network. The transport minister John Graham said the CCTV footage
  from onboard light rail vehicles in Sydney, the Eastern Suburbs, Parramatta
  and Newcastle showed the vulnerability of pedestrians, bike riders and people
  on mobility scooters around trams. The government urged passengers and
  pedestrians to prioritise their safety by staying alert, putting down phones,
  not rushing and observing road rules and signs. Motorists were reminded that,
  unless signed otherwise, U-turns were not permitted at traffic lights and
  “illegally turning across light rail tracks puts everyone at risk”. The vision
  includes footage of cars and bikes crossing in the path of trams, which Graham
  said could have easily ended in injury or worse: These moments are hard to
  watch because in some cases there is just centimetres or milliseconds from the
  result being so much worse. Marles is asked a final question about tax reform
  in the context of the Albanese government’s forthcoming productivity
  roundtable. He says “the tax policies that we have are what we took to the
  election but we need to be lifting productivity in this country”. “And over
  the longer-term, we need to have a clear eye as to how best to do that. We’re
  not seeking to constrain the ideas that are put forward at the roundtable next
  week.” Richard Marles also repeated the government’s position that “we are not
  supplying weapons to Israel”. He was asked by host David Speers if the
  government would block the sale of armoured steel and F-35 components to
  Israel. Marles said: Let’s be clear we don’t supply weapons to Israel. We’re
  an F-35 country and we have been that for a couple of decades. That is a
  multi-lateral arrangement with supply chains that are organised by Lockheed
  Martin in the United States and have multiple supplies in respect of all of
  those supply chains. So really that is a very different question. We are a
  part of that process. More on Insiders, Marles is asked if he is concerned
  that any attempt by Israel to take control of Gaza City would be a violation
  of international law. Marles says the government is “opposed to this decision
  and we urge Israel not to take this step” and “we need to see an end to
  hostilities and we need to see that now”. We have got a humanitarian
  catastrophe playing out in Gaza. We need to see humanitarian assistance flow
  to the people in Gaza and we obviously need to see a return of the hostages
  from Hamas that are being held in Gaza and a return of those hostages to their
  families in Israel. He says the government is “worried” about whether Israel
  occupying Gaza City would represent a breach of international law, “but our
  fundamental point here is that food and aid being prevented is a breach of
  international law”. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is appearing on
  the ABC’s Insiders. He is asked if he agrees with statements by US secretary
  of state Marco Rubio that announcements by countries including France to
  recognise a Palestinian state had “encouraged Hamas to abandon ceasefire
  talks”. Marles said: If you support a two-state solution, what that means is
  that you support the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to a
  state but also you understand that the only enduring pathway to peace is to
  have two states living side by side with each’s security mutually assured.
  Asked the same question again, he adds: I think recognition is a separate
  question … it is important to talk about the factors that are part of
  recognition and we have articulated as we have discussed this question that
  there can be no role for Hamas in a future Palestinian state. Anthony Albanese
  and his New Zealand counterpart, Christopher Luxon, have discussed the Middle
  East war and Israel’s plans to take control of more of Gaza in coming days.
  The PM said Australia would make its own decisions about recognising
  Palestinian statehood, likely ahead of the United Nations general assembly in
  New York next month. On Saturday, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong,
  joined with ministers from New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany
  to issue a new statement condemning the plans and warning the moves risk
  breaching international law and putting the lives of hostages and civilians in
  renewed danger. Albanese said there were no immediate plans for additional
  sanctions on Israeli government figures but Australia took the suffering in
  Gaza very seriously. We called for an immediate ceasefire. We called for the
  release of hostages and we called for the unimpeded entry of aid into Gaza,”
  he said in Arrowtown on Sunday morning. We have a humanitarian catastrophe
  unfolding there. And the idea that it can just be continued is completely
  unacceptable. Anthony Albanese says Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  must be a party to Donald Trump’s upcoming ceasefire talks with Russia’s
  Vladimir Putin. The two leaders are set to talk about the invasion of Ukraine
  in Alaska this week. Trump has flagged “swapping of territories” between both
  sides but is unclear if the Ukrainian leader will be invited to attend.
  Speaking during his visit to New Zealand on Sunday, the prime minister said
  Ukraine must be included in any discussion about the war. He said: We must
  remember that it is Russia and Vladimir Putin who is the aggressor here, who
  has breached international law, who has engaged in an illegal and immoral
  invasion of Ukraine, who has taken action, which has resulted in death and
  destruction in Ukraine. And Vladimir Putin can end all this tomorrow. He can
  just withdraw behind his boundaries of Russia. It’s also had a huge impact, of
  course, on the global economy. It’s one of the factors that fed into global
  inflation that had consequences on supermarket shelves right around the world.
  The end of Tasmanian government support for the greyhound racing industry
  would coincide with the end of the current funding deed. Premier Jeremy
  Rockliff said on Sunday: It’s time to draw a line in the sand and ensure an
  orderly exit from greyhound racing in Tasmania. He acknowledged the news would
  be “extremely disappointing” for many in the greyhound industry, but said it
  had become increasingly clear it didn’t align with community expectations.
  It’s Lisa Cox with you to bring you up to speed as we start the day. AAP is
  reporting that the Tasmanian Liberals would phase out funding for greyhound
  racing by 2029 – effectively ending the sport in the state – in a bid to
  secure the support of crossbenchers in minority government. The Tasmanian
  premier, Jeremy Rockliff, who is looking to shore up the support of
  progressive independents, said the time had come to make a call on the future
  of greyhound racing in the state. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles,
  will appear on the ABC’s Insiders this morning, while Anthony Albanese has
  been meeting his counterpart, Christopher Luxon, in New Zealand. We will bring
  you all the latest as it happens.

The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, will appear on the ABC’s Insiders this morning, while Anthony Albanese has been meeting his counterpart, Christopher Luxon, in New Zealand. We will bring you all the latest as it happens.
