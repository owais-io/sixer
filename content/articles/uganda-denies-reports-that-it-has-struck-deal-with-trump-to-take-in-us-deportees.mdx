  Uganda said it has not reached any agreement with the US to take in
  undocumented immigrants, contradicting reports that the east African country
  had struck a deal with the Trump administration to do so. Henry Oryem Okello,
  Uganda’s state minister for foreign affairs, told Reuters the country does not
  have the capability to take in immigrants. It comes as the US has deported
  migrants convicted of crimes in the US to non-native countries including South
  Sudan and Eswatini. “To the best of my knowledge we have not reached such an
  agreement. We do not have the facilities and infrastructure to accommodate
  such illegal immigrants in Uganda. So, we cannot take in such illegal
  immigrants,” Oryem said. On Tuesday, CBS News, citing internal government
  documents, reported that the White House had reached deportation deals with
  Honduras and Uganda. CBS News wrote that Uganda had “agreed to accept
  deportees from the US who hail from other countries on the continent, as long
  as they don’t have criminal histories”. The White House did not immediately
  respond to a request for clarification. The US Department of Homeland Security
  said in June that third-country deportations – sending undocumented migrants
  from the US to countries other than their own – were necessary to expel people
  “so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won’t take them back”. Critics
  have said the deportations are unnecessarily cruel. In July, the US flew five
  immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini – an
  absolute monarchy with a troubling record. Eswatini, the subject of a damning
  human rights report by the state department in 2023, said it had accepted the
  US deportees after “months of robust high-level engagements” with the US.
  Though other administrations have conducted third-country removals, the Trump
  administration’s practice of sending immigrants to countries facing political
  and human rights crises have raised international alarm and condemnation.
  Uganda, a US ally in east Africa, hosts nearly 2 million refugees and
  asylum-seekers, who mostly come from countries in the region such as
  Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.
