  A quick left hook, a front kick to the chest, a few criss-cross jabs, and the
  crowd cheers. But it is not kickboxing prowess that concludes the match. It is
  an attempted roundhouse kick that squarely misses its target, sending the
  kickboxer from a top university team tumbling to the floor. While traditional
  kickboxing comes with the risk of blood, sweat and serious head injuries, the
  competitors in Friday’s match at the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games in
  Beijing faced a different set of challenges. Balance, battery life and a sense
  of philosophical purpose being among them. The kickboxers, pint-sized humanoid
  robots entered by teams from leading Chinese technological universities, are
  part of a jamboree of humanoid events taking place at China’s latest
  technology event. After spectators in the 12,000-seater National Speed Skating
  Oval, built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, stood for the Chinese national
  anthem on Friday morning, the government-backed games began. “I came here out
  of curiosity,” said Hong Yun, a 58-year-old retired engineer, sat in the front
  row. Seeing the robots race was “much more exciting than seeing real humans”,
  Hong added. The games put on display China’s prowess in humanoid robotics, a
  technological field that has been pushed to the forefront of the country’s
  artificial intelligence industry. The hype machine is in full swing. As well
  as kickboxing, humanoids participated in athletics, football and dance
  competitions. One robot had to drop out of the 1500-metre because its head
  flew off partway round the course. “Keeping [the head] balanced while in
  movement is the biggest challenge for us,” said Wang Ziyi, a 19-year-old
  student from Beijing Union University, who was part of the team that entered
  the robot. Ever since a troupe of humanoid dancing robots took the stage at
  the 2025 Spring Festival Gala, a televised lunar new year’s celebration viewed
  nearly 17bn times online, Beijing has been enthusiastically pushing the
  adoption of “embodied AI” – an industry that was singled out in this year’s
  government work report in March. The social-media-friendly events reflect a
  more serious geopolitical reality: an intensifying US-China technological
  competition that could reshape the frontiers of AI. The technology has become
  a lightning rod for relations between the two countries. And while the US
  still has the lead on frontier research, owing in part to Washington’s
  restrictions on the export of cutting-edge chips to China, Beijing is going
  all-in on real life applications, such as robotics. Several cities, including
  Beijing and Shanghai, have established 10bn yuan (£1bn) robotics industry
  funds. In January, the state-owned Bank of China announced plans for a 1tn
  yuan of financial support to the AI industry over the next five years. “If
  there is an area where [Beijing] thinks that China is ahead, or could be
  positioned as a world leader, then they really want to draw attention to that
  area,” said Dr Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University. There is
  something strangely ominous about seeing jerky, human-like robots with two
  arms, two legs, and blank heads being dragged out of the ring to be recharged
  by their human handlers. When it comes to humanoids, the Chinese industry has
  many advantages. Although US companies such as Tesla and Boston Dynamics are
  still seen as the overall market leaders, several Chinese firms such as UBTech
  and Unitree Robotics – which supplied the boxing robots in Friday’s games –
  are catching up. Tesla relies on China for many of the parts needed to build
  the company’s physical humanoids. The US investment bank Morgan Stanley
  estimates that China-based supply chains produce robots at a third of the cost
  of non-China suppliers. “It appears to be very difficult to entirely decouple
  from China in this space,” wrote Sheng Zhong, the bank’s head of China
  industrials research, in a recent note. As well as generating positive
  publicity on social media, China views humanoids as being part of the solution
  to the problems created by the country’s ageing population and shrinking
  workforce. A recent article in People’s Daily, a mouthpiece of the Chinese
  Communist party, said robots could offer practical and emotional support for
  older people. “The vision of robot-assisted elderly care is not far away,” it
  said. Humanoid robots could also take the place of employees on factory lines
  as China tries to retrain and redeploy its workforce into more hi-tech jobs.
  But for all the hype, there is a big gap between humanoids stumbling over
  footballs and reliably handling daily tasks. Safely interacting with
  vulnerable humans would be another leap. “The home is probably one of the last
  places you’ll ever find a humanoid robot because of safety,” said Chan. “My
  general view on the whole humanoid explosion … is honestly a bit of
  scepticism.” Two of the biggest barriers to the technology being useful
  outside of PR stunts are the complexity of the human-built environment and the
  hands needed to navigate it. While other forms of AI, such as large language
  models, can be trained using reams of digital data, there are much smaller
  datasets available for training an algorithm on how to walk through crowded
  restaurants or up and down flights of stairs. Although China’s efforts to get
  robots out into the real world can help companies to harvest more data, it is
  still a big bottleneck in the industry, Chan said. Dr Jonathan Aitken, a
  robotics teacher at the University of Sheffield, agreed. “The state of AI is
  nowhere near seeing humanoids operating out of uncontrolled environments,” he
  said. And while robots jumping and kicking looks impressive, mundane daily
  tasks such as handling a kitchen knife or folding laundry requires dexterous
  hands, a skill technology companies have yet to crack. A human hand has about
  27 “degrees of freedom” – ie, independent movements through space. Tesla’s
  Optimus humanoid, one of the most advanced models on the market, has 22.
  Still, China has beat the odds before when it comes to turbocharged advances.
  Just 10 years ago, the country exported fewer than 375,000 cars a year. Now
  China is the world’s biggest automobile supplier, shipping nearly 6m vehicles
  annually. The European Union has increased tariffs on Chinese-built electric
  vehicles in an attempt to stem the flow. In China, the political and public
  will is firmly behind the humanoids. Zhan Guangtao came to the humanoid games
  with her two daughters on Friday, after her elder child’s school gave them
  free tickets. “It’s good to have my children in touch with the world’s most
  advanced robotics,” Zhan said. “Exposing them to hi-tech will broaden their
  horizons.” Additional research by Lillian Yang
