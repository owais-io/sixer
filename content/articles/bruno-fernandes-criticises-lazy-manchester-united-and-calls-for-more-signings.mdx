  Manchester United’s captain, Bruno Fernandes, let rip at his teammates after
  their 2-2 pre-season draw with Everton, saying their performance was “lazy”
  and calling for further reinforcements. A second-half goal from Mason Mount
  had United on course for victory in Atlanta, Georgia, after Fernandes’s opener
  was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, but a bizarre 75th-minute own goal by
  Ayden Heaven gave Everton the draw. The result put a slight dampner on
  United’s tour of the US, after promising victories over West Ham and
  Bournemouth. “It’s been important for developing how we want to play and
  getting the new players involved,” Fernandes told NBC Sports. “We didn’t want
  to finish in this way. Our performance wasn’t the best and we were a little
  bit lazy. We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any
  moment.” United had their worst Premier League campaign last season, finishing
  15th, and have signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo – both of whom started
  against Everton. “It’s improving,” Fernandes said. “But it’s not the place it
  needs to be. I don’t want to take a dig at anyone, but the club is doing the
  best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about. “But it was
  crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more
  quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI. Hopefully,
  we can get one or two players more to help with that.” Asked about Fernandes’s
  comments, Ruben Amorim said: “I’m happy for the players to have that feeling.
  It’s saying they understand the situation. “The momentum of the tour was
  perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and
  then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season. We are
  going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].” The
  manager said during the US tour he hoped to be with the club for two decades.
  “I want to stay 20 [years]. That is my goal. I truly believe in that.” Amorim
  said he had a positive relationship with the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who
  heads the football operation. “It’s really easy to deal with Jim. If you know
  your stuff, how to explain any decision, you’ll be fine. I know he’s the owner
  of the club, I know my place. But when I need to say something, I’m really
  direct. I think it’s something he likes a lot.”
