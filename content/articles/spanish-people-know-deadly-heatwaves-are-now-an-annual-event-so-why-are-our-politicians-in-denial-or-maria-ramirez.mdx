  Growing up in Madrid, intense summer heat was nothing unusual. I quickly
  learned always to cross the street in search of shade, and never to be caught
  out in the sun at 3pm. But as a child in the early 1980s, I never felt dizzy
  after spending more than a few minutes outdoors, nor did I struggle to study
  or sleep at home because of the heat. Back then, air conditioning was a
  rarity, something only Americans had. But we were fine: the stuttering fan in
  my mother’s Ford Fiesta was enough to keep us comfortable on holiday escapes
  from the capital. What is happening in Spain now goes far beyond discomfort.
  More than 1,500 deaths have already been linked to heatwaves this summer
  alone. Public-sector workers are collapsing from heatstroke on our city
  streets. Entire communities in the Madrid suburbs have been devastated by
  wildfires. On Monday, 198 weather stations recorded temperatures of 40C or
  higher. Following a record-breaking July, the first 20 days of August will
  probably be the warmest on record. Alongside housing, the climate crisis is
  Spain’s most visible and most persistent problem: every summer reminds us of
  this. You can’t ignore it, or escape it; so why are Spain’s politicians still
  so reluctant to tackle the climate emergency? Fighting global heating is a
  worldwide challenge, but protecting populations against the consequences –
  with an awareness that Europe is heating faster than other continents – must
  also be a national and a local priority. Within Spain, the climate crisis too
  often becomes an excuse for superficial, party-political feuds. In the
  population at large, there has been years of broad popular consensus, but
  contrast that with Spain’s politicians, for whom the issue has become
  increasingly partisan, with the right and the left fighting over totemic
  policies about cars and bikes. Even Spain’s centre-left coalition government,
  led by Pedro Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), has taken only
  modest steps to reduce emissions from industry and transport. And as they do
  on other issues, the socialists rush to point the finger at regional and local
  governments run by the conservative People’s party (PP), supported in some
  cases by the far-right Vox, which has pushed falsehoods and conspiracy
  theories about the climate crisis. It is true that Spain’s regional and local
  governments, powerful and well funded, also bear great responsibility: for
  protecting the most vulnerable from extreme heat, adapting public spaces,
  planting trees and ensuring there is sufficient shade and water fountains. One
  urgent necessity is the creation of “cool banks”, especially for people in
  overcrowded and overheated homes, those with health vulnerabilities, the very
  young and the very old. Valencia has a network of these climate shelters,
  while Barcelona has mapped out hundreds of public spaces where people can
  escape the heat, from libraries to museums. But too many local governments are
  still failing to provide respite. Madrid is among the worst offenders. Public
  cooling centres are almost nonexistent, and shopping centres remain the most
  common refuge. The capital’s conservative regional and local governments have
  been passive or even hostile towards public demands to reduce dangerous heat
  levels in neighbourhoods, with too few green spaces and too many cars. When
  Madrid’s city hall does spend money, it often misses the point: the most
  absurd example is Puerta del Sol, the central square that after months of
  renovation work still feels like a concrete frying pan all summer. Only after
  protests did the city council finally install a few flimsy shades, at a cost
  of €1.5m. For those Madrileños who have the option, the traditional way to
  make August bearable has been to escape the city for the coast. My childhood
  memories of cooler summers visiting grandparents in northern Spain feel very
  distant now. The north still enjoys bearable nights and some rain in the
  summer, but heatwaves have become more frequent there too. The change is fast
  and visible, even in daily life. This year in the Basque country, beach
  bathing has been repeatedly banned because of the portuguese man o’war, a
  creature resembling a jellyfish, but one that is much more toxic and
  dangerous. Once confined to warmer Atlantic waters, it has only begun
  appearing here in recent years. On a recent walk along San Sebastián’s beach,
  I spotted dozens, fortunately tiny, each circled in the sand to warn
  passersby. More medical resources and surveillance are now being devoted to
  this new threat – another example of the small everyday adaptations we are
  having to make. The most dramatic consequences of the climate crisis make
  headlines around the world: the tragic deaths of workers in vulnerable jobs,
  picking fruit or cleaning streets, and wildfires killing people, destroying
  homes and even a Roman-era mining site – now a burned-out Unesco world
  heritage site. But across Spain, the signs are everywhere: crops ruined by
  hail, high-speed trains disrupted, and neighbourhoods baking in the heat. This
  is the new reality we are living with. It has become a regular fixture in our
  calendars. A journalist colleague of mine observed earlier this year that the
  most important annual climate event for the media is not Cop, it’s the summer.
  It was February in the northern hemisphere, and he was already preparing their
  annual heatwave coverage. My newsroom in Madrid does the same, with ever more
  sophisticated data and analysis. The frustrating question is why our
  politicians are still shrugging off this reality, as though it were just an
  inconvenience. How many broken records and how many heatwave deaths will it
  take to change this? María Ramírez is a journalist and the deputy managing
  editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in Spain
