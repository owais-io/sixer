  Mrs Robinson 8pm, Sky Documentaries “Climate change is a man-made problem and
  requires a feminist solution.” Mary Robinson has one hell of a legacy:
  Ireland’s first female president – she helped decriminalise homosexuality and
  legalised female contraception – who later became a UN high commissioner and
  has put global focus on the climate crisis. As women’s rights are going
  backwards in the US and the climate challenge is running out of time, she
  tells her story in this documentary. Hollie Richardson Eisteddfod 2025 With
  Huw Stephens 7pm, BBC Four The festival of Welsh arts is celebrated in Wrexham
  this year – with Wrexham FC and its Hollywood owners inspiring the opening
  show about supporting local teams. Events include a tribute to Dewi “Pws”
  Morris and a performance by classical harpist Catrin Finch, folk fiddler
  Patrick Rimes and singer Al Lewis. HR Parenthood 7.20pm, BBC One In India, a
  pregnant Hanuman langur babysits a mate’s little one to get some practice in.
  Will she get the hang of it? And how will she stay safe from stray dogs? It’s
  another round of nature’s sweet and scary parenting moments, this time
  focusing on animals in the grasslands across the globe. HR Ridley 8pm, ITV1 A
  new case for Adrian Dunbar as the grieving, jazz-loving detective in this
  Sunday night sleuther. A body found decomposed in thick local woodland belongs
  to a woman who went missing six years previously. With his team in shock,
  Ridley has to call on a disgraced ex-officer to help him find the culprit.
  Jack Seale The Narrow Road to the Deep North 9.20pm, BBC One The book launch
  is approaching in the final episode of this impressively realised novel
  adaptation, and the older Dorrigo is reflecting on his life. He’s still
  tormented by memories of his wartime experiences but will externalising them
  allow him a measure of peace? Phil Harrison The Veil 11pm, Channel 4 With
  suspected Islamic State operative Adilah (Yumna Marwan) having escaped her
  captors, and MI6 agent Imogen (Elisabeth Moss) getting blamed, the two women
  are separated for much of this episode. But that doesn’t mean their uneasy
  alliance is over. Meanwhile, has anyone in this show considered the ethics of
  kidnapping a child for leverage? Seems not. Ellen E Jones Live sport Premier
  League Football: Chelsea v Crystal Palace, 1pm, Sky Sports Main Event At
  Stamford Bridge. Followed by Man United v Arsenal at 4pm. Super League Rugby:
  St Helens v Huddersfield Giants, 2.15pm, BBC Two From Totally Wicked Stadium.
