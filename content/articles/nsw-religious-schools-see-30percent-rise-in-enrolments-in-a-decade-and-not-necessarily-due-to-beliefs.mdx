  When the Australian Christian College (ACC) in north-west Sydney began
  receiving a surge of enrolments after the pandemic lockdowns, its principal,
  Brendan Corr, was not surprised. ACC is located in Marsden Park, a major
  growth corridor of Sydney identified by the state government as an area where
  a failure to factor in the pace and scale of development has left families
  without access to local public schools. ACC has more than doubled in size,
  from 667 students in 2019 to 2,155 in 2024, the strongest growth of any
  independent school in New South Wales. While 60% of families are Christian,
  40% either have no religion or are from other faith backgrounds, predominantly
  Hindu. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The ACC is not an outlier. Enrolments
  in religious schools have increased by a record 30% in NSW in the past decade,
  new data shows – and not necessarily correlating with student beliefs. The
  Association of Independent Schools of NSW (AISNSW), the peak body for the
  state’s 430 independent schools, released a new report on Wednesday finding
  independent schools have enrolled almost two-thirds of the state’s additional
  students since 2000 – growing by 101,565. More new students were enrolled in
  NSW independent schools in the past five years than every state and territory
  government school sector combined. They now account for almost 20% of state
  enrolments, up from 13% in 2000. And religious independent schools, which
  represent more than 80% of the sector, have done the heavy lifting. Enrolments
  surged by 30% in a decade, compared with 2% in government schools and 6% in
  Catholic systemic systems. Growth was highest in Sydney’s north-west and
  south-west, including Blacktown, Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury, where 10 new
  low-to-medium fee independent schools opened over the past decade. The acting
  education minister, Courtney Houssos, says the former government “neglected
  growing suburbs”, leaving “many families” in western Sydney without a public
  school option. An audit of enrolment growth in NSW, released last year, found
  the top 10 student growth areas between 2018 and 2023, all located in Sydney’s
  north-west and south-west corridors, collectively accounted for almost 40% of
  the state’s student enrolment growth. Houssos says the state government is
  investing $9bn in new and upgraded schools, including $3.9bn in western
  Sydney, to address the backlog, including new schools in Leppington,
  Tallawong, Box Hill, Gables, Gledswood Hills and Jordan Springs. Corr believes
  his school’s success is not just down to geography. “Spiritual nurturing is
  something that’s important to our parents,” he says. “It’s not even just that
  people of non-faith are welcomed into the school, which they undoubtedly are.
  “Regardless of the faith position of a family, the students gain benefit of
  being part of our Christian community, because of the way we see humanity and
  serve it.” AISNSW’s chief executive, Margery Evans, says the face of
  independent schools is changing, led by low-to-medium fee Christian, Islamic
  and Anglican schools. “In 2025, the typical independent school is co-ed, K-12,
  faith-based, located west of Parramatta and charging less than $6,000 a year,”
  Evans says. That’s despite a decline in religious affiliation. The percentage
  of students who identified as having no faith in NSW almost doubled in the
  past decade, the report found, from 16% to 29%. But while affiliation with
  Christianity dropped from 55% to 38%, students identifying as Islamic
  increased from 8% to 12%. The findings aligned with the latest census data,
  which found religious affiliation had dramatically reduced overall, but
  non-Christian religions, including Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism, grew
  – from 3.5% of the population in 1996 to 10% in 2021, or 2.5 million people.
  Anglican schools enrolled the largest proportion of students in NSW
  independent schools (27%), followed by Catholic independent (18%) and
  Christian (16%), the AISNSW report found. They were among 15 different faiths
  represented in the state’s schooling system, from Hare Krishna to Seventh Day
  Adventist, Pentecostal and Brethren. Islamic schools experienced the most
  rapid annual enrolment growth of any sector in the past five years (5.2%, or
  an additional 5,074 students), representing 9% of the state’s religious
  schools overall. Four expanded by more than 20% in the past five years,
  placing them among the top 15 fastest-growing schools statewide. The religious
  schools sector has faced backlash in recent years for allowing staff and
  students to be discriminated against on the basis of sexuality and gender
  identity. Last year, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended the
  blanket exemptions should be repealed, a view backed by the majority of
  Australians, but the prime minister has ruled out legislating new laws without
  bipartisan support. Emma Rowe, an associate professor in education at Deakin
  University, says religious schools can be “very inclusive” towards different
  identities. But she is against private schools – disproportionately composed
  of religious schools – receiving taxpayer money. “I’m not opposed to religious
  schools receiving government funding. I’m opposed to private schools receiving
  government funding,” Rowe says. “If you want to practise a religion in school,
  but you’re not charging tuition fees, and you are accepting everyone at the
  door – I think that’s different.”
