  Back in the day there was a low-profile sport called women’s rugby union. Few
  people went to watch, the media seldom took an interest and the world’s top
  players were enthusiastic amateurs. Anyone predicting Twickenham would one day
  be packed to the rafters for a standalone women’s fixture would have been
  dismissed as crazy. And now? There is a different sport in town. It is simply
  known as rugby and now more than ever it belongs to both sexes. Next month’s
  World Cup final, accordingly, has attracted a full house in excess of 80,000,
  and a huge global television audience is guaranteed. If all goes to plan the
  Lionesses will not be the only female sporting queens adorning teenage bedroom
  walls in England. The Red Roses may or may not be crowned world champions at
  the end of September but public interest in them is about to soar. The
  organisers report that 375,000 tickets have been bought before the tournament
  has even kicked off. Given the entire 2017 competition in Belfast attracted
  45,412 people at an average of 1,514 spectators per game, the step change has
  been remarkable. Little wonder World Rugby’s leading officials cannot wait for
  the 2025 edition to commence. “It’s going to be an amazing tournament,” says
  Alan Gilpin, the governing body’s chief executive. “We knew when we took the
  decision to take the 2025 Rugby World Cup to England that it was going to be
  the right market at the right time. The Lionesses have given us a little
  reminder of what that means. The movement behind women’s sport, particularly
  in England and across the UK is significant. People are really excited about
  it.” Because, as Gilpin notes, the next few weeks have the potential to
  refresh rugby in all its guises. At men’s internationals there is usually a
  more traditional, crustier demographic. Starting with England’s opening game
  against the United States in Sunderland, this tournament is going to hit
  differently. “Younger audiences, younger ticket purchasers, a younger TV
  audience … I think it’s going to show a different face of rugby to the UK
  audience,” says Gilpin. As those of us lucky enough to be present in New
  Zealand in 2022 can testify, there is also another important ingredient. The
  number of truly competitive female teams may still be fewer than on the men’s
  side but the style of play is arguably even more marketable. Less meat-head
  physicality and mindless kicking, more high-class skills, more space in which
  to run … for novices and connoisseurs alike the games can be hugely watchable.
  For a prime example have a look back at the breathless finale between England
  and New Zealand in Auckland three years ago. It may be that England would have
  won had Lydia Thompson not been sent off in the first half for a high tackle.
  But what no one could possibly dispute was the quality of the Black Ferns’
  counterattacking game, their pace, their ability to exploit space and their
  willingness to take a calculated risk or two. Helped in no small part by the
  enlightened coaching of the great Wayne Smith and the vastly experienced Sir
  Graham Henry, New Zealand confounded expectations to win 34-31. Even more
  important, perhaps, was the feelgood atmosphere at Eden Park on that clear,
  dry November day. Happy families, compelling new role models, spectacular
  sport … it was a tantalising vision of just how inclusive the traditionally
  staid world of rugby could be. And therein lies the real opportunity of the
  next five weeks. Kate Zackary, the captain of England’s first-up opponents,
  the USA, has already underlined precisely what is at stake. “This Rugby World
  Cup isn’t just about us,” the back-rower said as the squad began preparations
  for England 2025. “We want kids across the US to see this team and think:
  ‘That could be me.’ Rugby in America is growing, and we’re here to kick that
  door wide open.” On and off the field there is a brighter future to be
  grasped, both by the sport more widely and the hosts in particular. “Where
  sisterhood meets rivalry” is the tournament’s slogan and the tag-line neatly
  reflects the friendly yet competitive vibe. Not that defeating the short-odds
  favourites will be remotely easy. New Zealand, France and Canada – probably in
  that order – loom as the major threats but the Red Roses’ biggest enemy
  potentially lurks closer to home. By the knockout stage the pressure will be
  mounting and nagging doubts will be multiplying. It is necessary only to
  rewind to the men’s World Cup in 2015 to be reminded that inflated
  expectations generated by home advantage can weigh heavily. So, yes, the Red
  Roses have greater depth than anyone else. Yes, the Rugby Football Union has
  spent millions of pounds on the squad’s preparation while Canada, for example,
  have been resorting to crowdfunding. But what if jangling nerves ultimately
  undermine all that? What if they were to ambushed by, say, France in a tense
  Bristol semi-final? Let’s just say a France v Canada final is not what the RFU
  ideally has in mind. Even World Rugby freely acknowledges that England are
  destined to be the tournament’s pivotal figures. “That’s not to say the Red
  Roses have to win for it to be successful because that’s not true at all but
  we obviously expect them to be highly competitive,” says Gilpin. At stake if
  they lose, however, will be the tournament’s carnival feel and, conceivably,
  the future funding structures of the entire women’s game. What if England’s
  long wait to replicate their triumph of 2014 – they have only ever conquered
  the world twice – is once more extended? It might even prompt all concerned –
  the RFU included – to wonder if committing millions to building fully
  professional programmes is absolutely necessary. Then again, let’s be honest.
  England winning every game by 30 points or more may cause some to lose
  interest, too. For all the thrilling running of Abby Dow and Ellie Kildunne,
  the midfield craft of Megan Jones, the relentless work-rate of Zoe Aldcroft
  and the all-round quality of their prop forwards Sarah Bern and Maud Muir, the
  Red Roses need to be pushed all the way. France only lost 43-42 on their last
  visit to Twickenham in April, while the Black Ferns are experts at peaking
  when it matters. Or could the combative Canadians emerge as the tournament’s
  dark mooses? Meanwhile, at the other end of the scale, it is similarly vital
  that teams further down the pecking order enjoy the experience. If Japan v
  Spain in York or Italy v Brazil in Northampton can attract decent attendances,
  the organisers will also be thrilled. Nor is an excessive number of one-sided
  blow-outs in anybody’s interests. Gilpin acknowledges that “the challenge for
  us all is how we drive investment in the women’s game … we want the tournament
  to be even bigger and better in Australia in 2029” and that in this year’s
  edition “there will be some matches that are less competitive because, in some
  cases, there is obviously a disparity in experience, professionalism and
  investment.” In that regard the opening game between John Mitchell’s England
  and the United States will be instructive given New Zealand put 79 points on
  the women’s Eagles in May. The first night crowd at the Stadium of Light will
  be hoping for a closer contest, not to mention a glimpse of the American
  social media favourite Ilona Maher. But if the stars align for the hosts even
  the Lionesses may be temporarily outshone.
