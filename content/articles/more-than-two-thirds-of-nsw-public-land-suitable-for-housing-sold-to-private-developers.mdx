  The New South Wales government has sold more than two-thirds of publicly owned
  sites identified as surplus and suitable for housing to private developers as
  a result of its much-vaunted statewide property audit. Many sites are being
  sold without requirements for social or affordable housing. Despite a Labor
  policy directing that government land suitable for housing should be
  prioritised for public housing, Homes NSW has bought just three of the 55
  sites that have been identified for sale. It is now in the planning stage to
  construct 208 homes. It has expressed interest in a further seven sites.
  “Homes NSW and Landcom have a first right of refusal on all sites identified
  as part of the land audit,” a spokesperson for the Department of Lands said.
  “Approximately a third of all sites identified have been transferred to or are
  currently undergoing due diligence by Homes NSW or Landcom.” Another way of
  putting it: more than two-thirds of the land is going to private developers.
  “It’s increasingly clear that this land audit is actually a scam – and it’s
  those struggling with the housing crisis who will suffer from this broken
  promise,” the NSW Greens MP Jenny Leong said. “What was an election commitment
  to identity public land in order to deliver more social and affordable housing
  has been exposed for what it really is – a systematic way of selling off
  public land to the highest bidder with no requirement for any social or
  affordable housing,” she said. The government has, however, boosted the number
  of social houses on sites it already owns, with 1,711 homes added to the stock
  since it came to office. The sale of surplus land is part of the Minns Labor
  government’s plan to deliver up to 30,000 homes through the $6.6bn Building
  Homes for NSW program announced in the 2024-25 budget. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The government promised to build 8,400 public homes and a further
  21,000 affordable and market-rate homes. But progress has been slow. Leong
  said not a single new home had been built two years into the program. Despite
  the acute shortage of public housing and long waiting lists, the government
  had disposed of livable homes to the private sector. For example, three
  terrace houses in Rozelle, which were acquired during by Roads and Maritime
  during the building of WestConnex, were sold off to the private market in
  April. They sold for between $1.6m and $2.33m. A review of government sales by
  Guardian Australia found that most of the vacant land being sold by the Minns
  government is going to private sector developers, with no firm requirements
  for social or affordable housing as part of the terms of sale. The sites
  included: The dive site for WestConnex at Camperdown will not have any social
  or affordable housing, although the project will earmark 230 units for
  essential worker homes out of a likely 600 units, because of its proximity to
  the Royal Prince Alfred hospital. A site at 164 Talavera Road, Marsfield, also
  owned by Roads and Maritime, was sold for $4.4m to a developer for
  high-density development. The agent on the sale, Ray White’s Peter Vines, said
  there was no requirement for social or affordable housing. The buyer intended
  to build student accommodation, he said. A major site at 870 Windsor Road,
  Rouse Hill, not far from the new metro station, is at the tender stage. The
  CBRE agent Ben Wicks said there were no firm requirements from the government
  about levels of social and affordable housing. Bidders had been invited to put
  in multiple proposals that included social and affordable housing as well as
  build-to-rent projects, he said. A spokesperson for the minister for lands and
  property, Steve Kamper, said: “The land audit has so far identified surplus
  government sites capable of delivering more than 9,000 homes. “Any proceeds
  from surplus government sites developed into housing by the private sector
  will be directed back into the construction of new public housing.” But this
  is not as it seems. Leong insisted that she has been told that a Treasury
  policy requires land sale proceeds to be returned to the department that owned
  the land – often the roads, education or health departments. NSW Homes
  clarified that “the sale of any private housing on these sites will be used to
  build public housing”. At this stage the amount of money it had received was
  “nil”. Labor’s shifting sands At the 2022 NSW Labor policy conference, 800
  delegates unanimously endorsed an ambitious public housing program. It
  committed the state Labor party to introducing laws banning “the sale,
  leasing, or outsourcing of any public housing assets or services”. The
  resolution also required Labor to increase the number of public dwellings “at
  a rate exceeding private developments”. In the lead-up to the March state
  election, Labor promised residents of Sydney’s Redfern and Waterloo public
  housing estates that a Minns government would tear up the Coalition
  government’s plans to redevelop these estates. After taking the reins,
  however, the premier, Chris Minns, sought to redefine his election
  commitments. As he explained, his promise to “freeze the sale of all public
  and social housing” didn’t mean freezing existing plans to demolish an entire
  estate at Waterloo and rebuild it with the private sector. Instead he would
  improve it by ensuring that 30% of units remained social housing. Announcing
  the policy of selling off surplus land for housing in May 2023, Minns said his
  objective was to ensure each new block would include 30% social, affordable or
  inclusive housing. “It’s not privatisation even by the loosest definition of
  it,” he said. “We were very consistent and clear about our plans in relation
  to government land prior to the last election,” he said. Homes NSW projects
  Homes NSW has acquired some sites and there will be some new public housing
  built. The historic Clothing Store at Eveleigh, near Redfern, will be
  developed by Homes NSW into 500 units with 50% public housing. Two sites at
  Box Hill and Riverstone will be transferred to Homes NSW for potential
  development of almost 50 social and affordable homes and more than 35 market
  homes. The government said a further nine sites across Sydney and three sites
  in regional NSW had been identified for future housing development by either
  Landcom or in partnership with the private sector, to allow the estimated
  delivery of more than 1,300 market and affordable homes. But Landcom
  developments do not necessarily deliver affordable housing options, with its
  brief being to act as a publicly owned commercial developer. “If the NSW Labor
  government won’t even build public housing on public land that they already
  own, where will they build it?” Leong said. “Instead of identifying publicly
  owned land on which to deliver homes, NSW Labor has simply identified more
  things they want to flog off – this isn’t an ‘audit’ so much as a stocktake
  sale.”
