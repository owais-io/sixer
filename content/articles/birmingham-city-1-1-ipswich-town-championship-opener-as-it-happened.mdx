  Ben Bloom was at St Andrew’s, and here’s his report. Thanks for reading this
  MBM. Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna speaks to Sky. “It was a really tough game …
  it was always going to be that, coming here on the opening night … we didn’t
  impose ourselves well enough … the boys kept going … good impact from the
  bench … late goals will be important … Birmingham’s pressure was good, their
  intensity was good … it gives us a base to start with … I’m certain we will
  improve … there were some good things as well … sticking at it and getting the
  late goal is a big confidence booster … we have got some work to do … it was a
  passionate night … two passionate teams … it’s normal you will get flashpoints
  … I think there might have been an incident with the crowd and one of the
  players … that maybe wasn’t ideal … emotions run high … there is a lot of work
  to do in every aspect.” Birmingham boss Chris Davies talks to Sky. “It was a
  very good game … really pleased with how we played … disappointed with the
  penalty … to concede so late is always a sore one … for the large part of the
  game we were the better team … played well … a lot of positives … a lot to
  take from that … the players are down … the penalty is really harsh … you
  won’t see many of those given … the context is more painful … it’s just
  scraped his finger … that’s ridiculous, that decision … over the course of the
  season hopefully we get those back our way … we didn’t let them settle … the
  boys were really focused … Ipswich are a very good footballing side … they
  normally keep the ball … they couldn’t do that tonight … there are mixed
  emotions right now … frustrated … but I can see how many positives we can take
  from that … that’s a team that was in the Premier League last year … we won’t
  play many teams as good as that … we have to keep building … we’re together as
  a club … for a long time it was pretty broken.” The top of the Championship as
  it stands. Nothing more than a purist-goading exercise at this point in time.
  Jacob Greaves, whose header onto Lyndon Dykes’ arm won the equalising penalty,
  and who was also involved in Kyogo’s disallowed goal, adds: “I was just
  concentrating on the ball … I thought he’d give a foul on the keeper … but
  he’s pointed to the spot … I knew George was going to score, I see it in
  training every day … he got us the point … Kyogo was clever to be fair … I got
  a whack from behind … it is a foul … I felt contact … the ref got it right to
  be honest.” Maybe I went a bit early with the Everyone Friends Again
  observation, because here’s George Hirst talking to Sky. “That’s what I get
  paid to do at the end of the day … that’s my bread and butter … the
  centre-half said it was a rubbish penalty … in slightly different terms (!) …
  but it’s in the back of the net … that’s all that matters at the end of the
  day … we stuck together.” Birmingham deserved to win. Ipswich snatched a point
  they didn’t really deserve. But that’s Championship football. Everyone friends
  again at the final whistle, which is nice to see. 90 min +10: As for the
  penalty award, Dykes’ arm was certainly up in an unnatural position, but he
  didn’t know what was going on, facing the other way as Greaves headed the ball
  onto it. Unfortunate for the hosts, but there you are. 90 min +9: Chaplin was
  booked for celebrating the equaliser by slamming the ball into the stand
  behind the goal. Klarer took great offence and threatened to knock his block
  off, leading to the aforementioned brouhaha. 90 min +7: From the kick-off,
  Hirst skittles Paik. Then Laird slams into Broadhead. This was always
  threatening to boil over, and now it has. 90 min +5: The equaliser, and
  perhaps Ipswich’s celebrations, prove too much for Birmingham. Both teams
  engage in a big shoving match. Young has quite a lot to say for himself, while
  Chaplin earns a booking. Hirst waits for Allsop to commit himself, then slots
  down the middle. It’s Ipswich’s first shot on target all night! 90 min +3:
  Davis drops deep on the right and crosses long. Osayi-Samuel is forced to head
  behind for a corner. Young sends it long … and then the referee points to the
  spot! Greaves heads onto the outstretched arm of Dykes, and it’s a penalty for
  the Tractor Boys! 90 min +1: Dykes gallops after a long pass down the
  inside-left channel, but is never getting there ahead of Palmer, who claims on
  the edge of his box. 90 min: There have been quite a few subs, and quite a few
  stoppages, so there will be a minimum of eight minutes of added time. 89 min:
  Anderson goes down with cramp and is eventually replaced by Gardner-Hickman.
  87 min: Ipswich string a few passes together for the first time in a long
  while. Al-Hamadi finds himself in space, just inside the Birmingham box on the
  right, but slips and loses the chance to shoot. As good an opportunity as
  Ipswich have had all night, gone in an instant. 86 min: Young crosses from a
  deep position on the right. Hirst wins a header at the far stick, but can only
  eyebrow it over the bar. Allsop has had very little to do this evening. 85
  min: Another Ipswich change, as Humphreys replaces the debutant Matusiwa. 83
  min: Birmingham make a double change. Dykes replaces the goalscorer
  Stansfield, while in a more defensively-minded switch, Laird comes on for
  Gray. 81 min: Gray snaffles Young’s loose pass and nearly breaks into the
  Ipswich box down the left. Birmingham keep the visitors pinned back but Iwata
  releases the pressure by hoicking a dreadful long-range effort high and wide.
  79 min: Another Ipswich change, as Al-Hamadi comes on for Clarke. 78 min:
  Kyogo, with an assist and a harshly disallowed goal to his name on debut,
  makes way for Doyle. Appreciative applause soundtracks his departure. 76 min:
  Stansfield spins Taylor, who clumsily clanks into him. Taylor, on a yellow, is
  very apologetic. Stansfield isn’t that willing to accept the hand of
  friendship. The referee gives Taylor the benefit of the doubt. Just a free
  kick. To be fair, it was more clumsy than aggressive, but there’s another
  Ipswich midfielder treading a fine line. 74 min: Cochrane wastes the resulting
  free kick, aiming for the top-left corner. An ambitious shot, with the box
  full of team-mates demanding a cross. 73 min: Stansfield nicks the ball off
  Matusiwa, who fouls him from behind. Having already been booked, the new
  Ipswich midfielder wants to watch himself here. Then Greaves drags Kyogo to
  the ground as the striker probes down the right. These two teams are falling
  out. 71 min: Paik is booked for a late lunge on Matusiwa. Quite a few knowing
  challenges going in at the moment. 70 min: To a chorus of ear-splitting boos,
  Young crosses from the right, looking for Hirst, who tangles with Neumann. A
  bit of shoving. Everyone still on edge. 69 min: The first change of the
  evening, and it’s made by Ipswich. A triple change, in fact. Chaplin,
  Broadhead and Young come on for Szmodics, Ogbene and Johnson. The 40-year-old
  Young, formerly of Aston Villa, receives the pantomime abuse you’d expect. 67
  min: … but Ipswich soon get back to their metronomic passing. Birmingham hold
  them at arm’s length though. 65 min: Ipswich had enjoyed 90 percent of
  possession since the goal, a fine response to falling behind. So the hosts
  pass it around the back for a bit to reassert themselves. Anderson then buys a
  cheap free kick by turning the clumsy Johnson, and now it’s Birmingham’s turn
  to take their sweet time over a restart. 63 min: The resulting free kick leads
  to a corner on the right. Davis swings it in, and O’Shea heads it high over
  the bar. This match continues to bubble away without quite boiling over.
  There’s still time. 61 min: Cochrane flips Szmodics into the air, and Matusiwa
  takes exception to the act. An exchange of viewpoints. The referee tells
  everyone to simmer down. 59 min: Ipswich have done a lot of sitting back, but
  now they need to come out and play. So that’s what they do. Davis nearly gets
  on the end of Szmodics’ right-wing cross. Then Szmodics and Hirst one-two
  their way down the inside-right channel, only for Klarer to slide into view
  and hook away elegantly. A crucial intervention, because Szmodics would have
  been clear in the box. 57 min: The likes of Tom Brady and David Beckham are
  all good and well, but here’s a proper old-school celebrity Blue celebrating
  in the stand: Jasper Carrott. Second-city royalty. Palmer’s clearance is met
  on the halfway line by Osayi-Samuel, who heads it back down the inside-right
  channel. Kyogo gets in ahead of O’Shea, extending a leg and lobbing over
  Palmer. The ball cannons off the left-hand post and back to the feet of
  Stansfield, who can’t miss, and roofs it from six yards. St Andrew’s erupts!
  53 min: Osayi-Samuel passes back to Allsop under intense pressure from Clarke.
  There’s plenty of juice on the pass, so the keeper does well to chip it back
  to his full-back over the head of the buzzing Clarke. Birmingham hearts in
  mouths for a split second there. 51 min: Hirst gets involved with Klarer on
  the halfway line, as the pair tussle under a long ball. A feeling that it
  wouldn’t take too much for this game to erupt in the precision-throwing of
  hands. 49 min: Iwata tries to return the favour with a curler from the right,
  but with Kyogo lurking, Greaves clears behind for a corner. The resulting set
  piece falls to Paik on the left-hand edge of the D; Paik swings a leg and
  hoicks harmlessly wide left. A long way left. 47 min: Kyogo tees up Iwata on
  the edge of the Ipswich box with a cushioned pass. Iwata blazes over. 46 min:
  The ball skims off the top of Osayi-Samuel’s head and nearly out for a corner.
  Osayi-Samuel chases back to stop the ball on the line, but is then flattened
  by Hirst, who had also been chasing and couldn’t slow his run. Free kick.
  Hirst not afraid to put it about. Ipswich get the second half started. No
  changes. “Maybe there was to much hype to this fixture because neither side
  looks very impressive,” argues Mary Waltz. “Plus the officials wearing out
  their whistle has not helped.” Half-time entertainment. Who and what to look
  out for this season in the Championship, courtesy of Ben Fisher. Ipswich are
  favourites to go up, Birmingham third favourites. Both teams have
  45-and-a-half more games to justify those predictions. 45 min +2: Johnson
  curls in from the right. Taylor comes in from the other flank and shoulders
  the ball wide. A decent enough chance to end the half. 45 min +1: The first of
  two additional first-half minutes passes without incident. 45 min: Gray takes
  the resulting free kick. A gentle curler towards the right-hand side of the
  goal that nestles gently in Palmer’s midriff. Easy. 44 min: Anderson barrels
  down the middle of the park and is unceremoniously skittled from behind by
  Matusiwa. A tug of the shirt, then a cheeky knee in the coccyx. No complaints,
  as he took one for the team. Anderson had options either side. 43 min: The
  expected goals so far: 0.18 to 0.15. Probably not too much by way of surprise
  in that statistic. 41 min: Anderson curls in from the left. Osayi-Samuel races
  in, hoping to slam home, but Greaves gets in ahead of him, hooking clear. In
  any case, the flag goes up – correctly – for offside. 40 min: Anderson scuffs
  a shot from 25 yards. It’s deflected as well. No good. Easy for Palmer. But
  then Matusiwa fluffs a pass upfield, and now Stansfield is gifted a chance to
  shoot from distance. He drags it wide left. 38 min: Szmodics is fine to
  continue. 37 min: Szmodics sits down so he can get some attention from the
  physio. As the doc trots on, everyone else migrates to the touchline to get a
  drink. 35 min: The officials have had a bit of a shocker so far this evening,
  to be fair. 33 min: A free kick for Ipswich in the centre circle, awarded for
  a fair challenge by Iwata on Hirst. It’s launched towards Davis on the left.
  Birmingham stand stock-still, playing the offside trap well. But the flag
  doesn’t go up, and Davis whistles a shot-cum-cross through the six-yard box.
  Just as well that didn’t go in, because Birmingham would have had two reasons
  to complain. No VAR, you see. 32 min: Iwata threads a pass down the
  inside-left channel for Stansfield, who takes a touch to make space in the
  Ipswich box before leaning back and larruping over the bar. Palmer should have
  been put to work there. 31 min: The game settles down a bit, with Birmingham
  now slowing things down a tad, in order to nix Ipswich’s growing influence. 29
  min: Neumann pings a long pass down the right channel for Kyogo, who brings
  the ball down with a deft touch. But O’Shea comes across to block and clear
  before the striker can get a shot away. Kyogo looks in fine fettle, his old
  Celtic self, despite that weird interregnum at Rennes. 27 min: Szmodics, out
  on the left, has the opportunity to find Hirst in space on the edge of the
  Birmingham box, but misplaces the pass. After the slowest of starts, Ipswich
  are beginning to impose themselves on this game. 25 min: Allsop shanks a pass
  straight to Szmodics, in a pocket of space on the edge of the D. You’d expect
  Szmodics to work the bumbling goalkeeper at the very least, but he slices a
  wild shot wide left of the target. A huge let-off for the Birmingham keeper.
  24 min: Szmodics wins a ball he had no right to win, out on the left. He loops
  immediately into the Birmingham box … but none of his team-mates have kept up
  with play, and the hosts calmly let the ball bounce away from danger. 22 min:
  Stansfield threads a pass down the inside-left channel for Kyogo, who swivels
  and aims a first-time shot towards the bottom-left corner. Side netting.
  Palmer then takes his sweet time over the restart. The home fans are on a
  rolling boil. 20 min: O’Shea bangs long down the middle. For a second, it
  looks as though Szmodics will take the ball under control and tear clear. But
  just as he’s about to enter the box and shoot … hello, Neumann! He appears out
  of nowhere to flick the ball off Szmodics’ toe. Great last-ditch defending. 18
  min: Taylor and Osayi-Samuel bundle each other into touch and square up
  momentarily. It’s over very little, it has to be said. Both are booked. 16
  min: The referee Andrew Kitchen is whistling for anything and everything right
  now. Neither manager appears particularly happy with his no-contact approach;
  the crowd are certainly fuming. It’s needlessly stop-start. Plus we’ve already
  seen a perfectly good goal disallowed as a result of this fussy nonsense. 14
  min: Iwata shapes to advance down the middle and is shoved crudely in the back
  by Hirst. Just a free kick, but the foul stopped a Birmingham attack, and
  could easily have led to the first booking of the season. 12 min: Birmingham
  have enjoyed 84 percent of possession so far. Ipswich have been strangely
  passive. 10 min: Cochrane whips a cross in from the left. Osayi-Samuel romps
  in from the other flank but can’t connect. This is a fast, impressive start by
  Birmingham. 9 min: An almost identical incident, but this time it’s Greaves
  nudging Kyogo to shepherd the ball back to his keeper … and this time no foul
  is awarded! The home fans are furious, and you can understand why. 7 min:
  Kyogo gently nudges Greaves out of the way, under a long ball, and lobs Palmer
  elegantly from 25 yards. It should stand as a gloriously cheeky goal, but the
  referee blows for a foul on Greaves. That’s soft, and very generous to
  Ipswich. 5 min: It’s all Birmingham in terms of possession, the home side
  buzzing around, pressing hard. Ipswich have hardly touched the ball. When they
  do finally get it, they deliberately slow things down, Johnson taking an age
  over a throw. Blues boss Chris Davies isn’t happy at these antics, and tells
  the fourth official how he sees it. 3 min: A bit of time and space for
  Anderson out on the left. He’s got four team-mates to find in the Ipswich box,
  but seriously overhits his cross, which sails harmlessly into the stand behind
  the goal. 2 min: A rare old atmosphere at St Andrew’s this evening.
  Expectation ahoy. A quiet start on the pitch, however. Blues get the ball
  rolling. The new Championship season is underway! The teams take to the field
  of dreams … and it’s the start of a new season, so let us introduce you to
  their brand-new threads. Blues will be wearing … well, you’d think so,
  wouldn’t you? But their 2025-26 jersey is bluer than just plain old blue: it’s
  [squints, adjusts spectacles] “HYPER COBALT”. Ipswich sport their red away kit
  today, but the shoulders and arms have [moves pince-nez down bridge of nose]
  “a unique pattern created from the current crest to mark 30 years since the
  club moved to this version” and also an advertising patch which shills their
  most famous fan’s hot-sauce business. (And so, already, I’ve now made
  reference to both Brady and Sheeran. I’m sorry. I have failed you.) We’ll be
  off in a minute. Birmingham boss Chris Davies talks to Sky. “It’s the first
  game … we have a long season ahead of us … I was pleased we got a home game …
  it’s a bit of a celebration at getting promoted and our first game back at
  this level … we can share that with our fans … we are expecting a really tough
  match … the favourites … a really strong team … it suits the occasion … we
  must prove we can compete … the next game is the most important one and this
  is it … the next league is usually quicker so we tried to address that … speed
  and athleticism … could we get more of that in the team? … I think we have
  managed to do that … more goal threats … we won a lot of games by just a goal
  … set pieces as well … quality of delivery … still a way to go before I have a
  squad that is complete and we are happy with … we can’t wait for this game to
  get going.” Birmingham co-owner Tom Wagner is at St Andrew’s tonight, and he
  chats to Sky Sports. “Chris Davies has been unbelievable … for his first
  coaching gig to set a points record … to dominate the way he did is a
  testament to the way he prepares the team and squad … keeps them motivated …
  very, very pleased with the work he has done … with Tom Brady there is no such
  thing as ‘good enough’, you are either striving for excellence every single
  day or you may as well find somewhere else to be … that holds true for every
  member of the organisation … that’s what it takes for us to get to where we
  want to be … my expectations are that everybody performs at their very best …
  every member of staff … the folks we don’t see every day … the highest level …
  it sounds trite to say it, but that’s the reality … I certainly will have
  nothing to offer on who we should recruit, how we should play and what they
  should do for the 90 minutes, but I can certainly help with the culture and
  the attitude … thinking about the game and the experience as a supporter might
  … what would I want if I were on the other side of the wall? … if you keep
  that mindset and remember the club is theirs and not ours, you get 99 percent
  of the way there … we care about this city and the people who live and work
  here … I trust people will take me at my word when I say that.” Ipswich boss
  Kieran McKenna speaks to Sky, and is asked for his thoughts on his side being
  favourites for promotion. “It’s a positive … it reflects we’ve done some good
  things over the last few years … in the end it doesn’t mean very much, you
  have to earn the right every game, every week … there is a lot of work ahead
  of us … we are ready for the challenge … it’s not alien to us … in League One
  we were one of the promotion favourites … our depth isn’t what it needs to be
  in some positions … we’re pretty tight … we expect to be stronger in a few
  weeks’ time … [Ajax striker Chuba Akpom] has been well publicised … it’s one
  we’re trying to get done … we’re hoping for good news on that one.” Birmingham
  name three debutants in their starting XI. Kyōgo, formerly of Celtic, starts
  up front, while Bright Osayi-Samuel and Phil Neumann line up at the back.
  Demarai Gray makes his second debut for his boyhood club, having since played
  for Leicester, Bayer Leverkusen, Everton and Al-Ittifaq. Ipswich have one new
  name in their starting line-up: midfielder Azor Matusiwa. Ashley Young, 40
  last month, is on the bench waiting for his first start since his move from
  Everton. Birmingham City: Allsop, Samuel, Klarer, Neumann, Cochrane, Paik,
  Iwata, Anderson, Stansfield, Gray, Furuhashi. Subs: Beadle, Laird, Bielik,
  Cashin, Leonard, Doyle, Gardner-Hickman, Willumsson, Dykes. Ipswich Town:
  Palmer, Johnson, O’Shea, Greaves, Davis, Ogbene, Taylor, Matusiwa, Jack
  Clarke, Szmodics, Hirst. Subs: Walton, Kipre, Woolfenden, Chaplin, Young, Al
  Hamadi, Humphreys, Broadhead, Barbrook. Referee: Andrew Kitchen (Durham).
  Birmingham City and Ipswich Town return to the Championship tonight, albeit
  from different directions, and possibly therefore in different moods.
  Birmingham slummed it in League One last season, racking up 111 points on
  their way to the second third-tier title in their history; meanwhile Ipswich,
  having reached the Premier League arguably ahead of schedule, won just four
  games all season and were cashiered back from whence they came. Ipswich’s
  sorry fate won’t have any bearing on the ambitions of these two clubs. Town
  want to bounce back to the top flight immediately, and are the short-priced
  favourites to win this division; Birmingham fancy following in Ipswich’s
  footsteps, given the Tractor Boys were the last team to leap from League One
  to the Premier League with successive promotions, and they’re third-favourites
  in the race for glory. Everyone can work out how to stay in the Premier League
  when they get there. An exciting way to begin the Championship season, then.
  The match kicks off at 8pm UK time, and if we can get through the entire
  evening without reference to either Tom Brady or Ed Sheeran that’ll also be
  great.

Birmingham hold them at arm’s length though. 65 min: Ipswich had enjoyed 90 percent of possession since the goal, a fine response to falling behind. So the hosts pass it around the back for a bit to reassert themselves. Anderson then buys a cheap free kick by turning the clumsy Johnson, and now it’s Birmingham’s turn to take their sweet time over a restart. 63 min: The resulting free kick leads to a corner on the right. Davis swings it in, and O’Shea heads it high over the bar. This match continues to bubble away without quite boiling over. There’s still time. 61 min: Cochrane flips Szmodics into the air, and Matusiwa takes exception to the act. An exchange of viewpoints. The referee tells everyone to simmer down. 59 min: Ipswich have done a lot of sitting back, but now they need to come out and play. So that’s what they do. Davis nearly gets on the end of Szmodics’ right-wing cross. Then Szmodics and Hirst one-two their way down the inside-right channel, only for Klarer to slide into view and hook away elegantly. A crucial intervention, because Szmodics would have been clear in the box. 57 min: The likes of Tom Brady and David Beckham are all good and well, but here’s a proper old-school celebrity Blue celebrating in the stand: Jasper Carrott. Second-city royalty. Palmer’s clearance is met on the halfway line by Osayi-Samuel, who heads it back down the inside-right channel. Kyogo gets in ahead of O’Shea, extending a leg and lobbing over Palmer. The ball cannons off the left-hand post and back to the feet of Stansfield, who can’t miss, and roofs it from six yards. St Andrew’s erupts! 53 min: Osayi-Samuel passes back to Allsop under intense pressure from Clarke. There’s plenty of juice on the pass, so the keeper does well to chip it back to his full-back over the head of the buzzing Clarke. Birmingham hearts in mouths for a split second there. 51 min: Hirst gets involved with Klarer on the halfway line, as the pair tussle under a long ball. A feeling that it wouldn’t take too much for this game to erupt in the precision-throwing of hands. 49 min: Iwata tries to return the favour with a curler from the right, but with Kyogo lurking, Greaves clears behind for a corner. The resulting set piece falls to Paik on the left-hand edge of the D; Paik swings a leg and hoicks harmlessly wide left. A long way left. 47 min: Kyogo tees up Iwata on the edge of the Ipswich box with a cushioned pass. Iwata blazes over. 46 min: The ball skims off the top of Osayi-Samuel’s head and nearly out for a corner. Osayi-Samuel chases back to stop the ball on the line, but is then flattened by Hirst, who had also been chasing and couldn’t slow his run. Free kick. Hirst not afraid to put it about. Ipswich get the second half started. No changes. “Maybe there was to much hype to this fixture because neither side looks very impressive,” argues Mary Waltz. “Plus the officials wearing out their whistle has not helped.” Half-time entertainment. Who and what to look out for this season in the Championship, courtesy of Ben Fisher. Ipswich are favourites to go up, Birmingham third favourites. Both teams have 45-and-a-half more games to justify those predictions. 45 min +2: Johnson curls in from the right. Taylor comes in from the other flank and shoulders the ball wide. A decent enough chance to end the half. 45 min +1: The first of two additional first-half minutes passes without incident. 45 min: Gray takes the resulting free kick. A gentle curler towards the right-hand side of the goal that nestles gently in Palmer’s midriff. Easy. 44 min: Anderson barrels down the middle of the park and is unceremoniously skittled from behind by Matusiwa. A tug of the shirt, then a cheeky knee in the coccyx. No complaints, as he took one for the team. Anderson had options either side. 43 min: The expected goals so far: 0.18 to 0.15. Probably not too much by way of surprise in that statistic. 41 min: Anderson curls in from the left. Osayi-Samuel races in, hoping to slam home, but Greaves gets in ahead of him, hooking clear. In any case, the flag goes up – correctly – for offside. 40 min: Anderson scuffs a shot from 25 yards. It’s deflected as well. No good. Easy for Palmer. But then Matusiwa fluffs a pass upfield, and now Stansfield is gifted a chance to shoot from distance. He drags it wide left. 38 min: Szmodics is fine to continue. 37 min: Szmodics sits down so he can get some attention from the physio. As the doc trots on, everyone else migrates to the touchline to get a drink. 35 min: The officials have had a bit of a shocker so far this evening, to be fair. 33 min: A free kick for Ipswich in the centre circle, awarded for a fair challenge by Iwata on Hirst. It’s launched towards Davis on the left. Birmingham stand stock-still, playing the offside trap well. But the flag doesn’t go up, and Davis whistles a shot-cum-cross through the six-yard box. Just as well that didn’t go in, because Birmingham would have had two reasons to complain. No VAR, you see. 32 min: Iwata threads a pass down the inside-left channel for Stansfield, who takes a touch to make space in the Ipswich box before leaning back and larruping over the bar. Palmer should have been put to work there. 31 min: The game settles down a bit, with Birmingham now slowing things down a tad, in order to nix Ipswich’s growing influence. 29 min: Neumann pings a long pass down the right channel for Kyogo, who brings the ball down with a deft touch. But O’Shea comes across to block and clear before the striker can get a shot away. Kyogo looks in fine fettle, his old Celtic self, despite that weird interregnum at Rennes. 27 min: Szmodics, out on the left, has the opportunity to find Hirst in space on the edge of the Birmingham box, but misplaces the pass. After the slowest of starts, Ipswich are beginning to impose themselves on this game. 25 min: Allsop shanks a pass straight to Szmodics, in a pocket of space on the edge of the D. You’d expect Szmodics to work the bumbling goalkeeper at the very least, but he slices a wild shot wide left of the target. A huge let-off for the Birmingham keeper. 24 min: Szmodics wins a ball he had no right to win, out on the left. He loops immediately into the Birmingham box … but none of his team-mates have kept up with play, and the hosts calmly let the ball bounce away from danger. 22 min: Stansfield threads a pass down the inside-left channel for Kyogo, who swivels and aims a first-time shot towards the bottom-left corner. Side netting. Palmer then takes his sweet time over the restart. The home fans are on a rolling boil. 20 min: O’Shea bangs long down the middle. For a second, it looks as though Szmodics will take the ball under control and tear clear. But just as he’s about to enter the box and shoot … hello, Neumann! He appears out of nowhere to flick the ball off Szmodics’ toe. Great last-ditch defending. 18 min: Taylor and Osayi-Samuel bundle each other into touch and square up momentarily. It’s over very little, it has to be said. Both are booked. 16 min: The referee Andrew Kitchen is whistling for anything and everything right now. Neither manager appears particularly happy with his no-contact approach; the crowd are certainly fuming. It’s needlessly stop-start. Plus we’ve already seen a perfectly good goal disallowed as a result of this fussy nonsense. 14 min: Iwata shapes to advance down the middle and is shoved crudely in the back by Hirst. Just a free kick, but the foul stopped a Birmingham attack, and could easily have led to the first booking of the season. 12 min: Birmingham have enjoyed 84 percent of possession so far. Ipswich have been strangely passive. 10 min: Cochrane whips a cross in from the left. Osayi-Samuel romps in from the other flank but can’t connect. This is a fast, impressive start by Birmingham. 9 min: An almost identical incident, but this time it’s Greaves nudging Kyogo to shepherd the ball back to his keeper … and this time no foul is awarded! The home fans are furious, and you can understand why. 7 min: Kyogo gently nudges Greaves out of the way, under a long ball, and lobs Palmer elegantly from 25 yards. It should stand as a gloriously cheeky goal, but the referee blows for a foul on Greaves. That’s soft, and very generous to Ipswich. 5 min: It’s all Birmingham in terms of possession, the home side buzzing around, pressing hard. Ipswich have hardly touched the ball. When they do finally get it, they deliberately slow things down, Johnson taking an age over a throw. Blues boss Chris Davies isn’t happy at these antics, and tells the fourth official how he sees it. 3 min: A bit of time and space for Anderson out on the left. He’s got four team-mates to find in the Ipswich box, but seriously overhits his cross, which sails harmlessly into the stand behind the goal. 2 min: A rare old atmosphere at St Andrew’s this evening. Expectation ahoy. A quiet start on the pitch, however. Blues get the ball rolling. The new Championship season is underway! The teams take to the field of dreams … and it’s the start of a new season, so let us introduce you to their brand-new threads. Blues will be wearing … well, you’d think so, wouldn’t you? But their 2025-26 jersey is bluer than just plain old blue: it’s [squints, adjusts spectacles] “HYPER COBALT”. Ipswich sport their red away kit today, but the shoulders and arms have [moves pince-nez down bridge of nose] “a unique pattern created from the current crest to mark 30 years since the club moved to this version” and also an advertising patch which shills their most famous fan’s hot-sauce business. (And so, already, I’ve now made reference to both Brady and Sheeran. I’m sorry. I have failed you.) We’ll be off in a minute. Birmingham boss Chris Davies talks to Sky. “It’s the first game … we have a long season ahead of us … I was pleased we got a home game … it’s a bit of a celebration at getting promoted and our first game back at this level … we can share that with our fans … we are expecting a really tough match … the favourites … a really strong team … it suits the occasion … we must prove we can compete … the next game is the most important one and this is it … the next league is usually quicker so we tried to address that … speed and athleticism … could we get more of that in the team? … I think we have managed to do that … more goal threats … we won a lot of games by just a goal … set pieces as well … quality of delivery … still a way to go before I have a squad that is complete and we are happy with … we can’t wait for this game to get going.” Birmingham co-owner Tom Wagner is at St Andrew’s tonight, and he chats to Sky Sports. “Chris Davies has been unbelievable … for his first coaching gig to set a points record … to dominate the way he did is a testament to the way he prepares the team and squad … keeps them motivated … very, very pleased with the work he has done … with Tom Brady there is no such thing as ‘good enough’, you are either striving for excellence every single day or you may as well find somewhere else to be … that holds true for every member of the organisation … that’s what it takes for us to get to where we want to be … my expectations are that everybody performs at their very best … every member of staff … the folks we don’t see every day … the highest level … it sounds trite to say it, but that’s the reality … I certainly will have nothing to offer on who we should recruit, how we should play and what they should do for the 90 minutes, but I can certainly help with the culture and the attitude … thinking about the game and the experience as a supporter might … what would I want if I were on the other side of the wall? … if you keep that mindset and remember the club is theirs and not ours, you get 99 percent of the way there … we care about this city and the people who live and work here … I trust people will take me at my word when I say that.” Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna speaks to Sky, and is asked for his thoughts on his side being favourites for promotion. “It’s a positive … it reflects we’ve done some good things over the last few years … in the end it doesn’t mean very much, you have to earn the right every game, every week … there is a lot of work ahead of us … we are ready for the challenge … it’s not alien to us … in League One we were one of the promotion favourites … our depth isn’t what it needs to be in some positions … we’re pretty tight … we expect to be stronger in a few weeks’ time … [Ajax striker Chuba Akpom] has been well publicised … it’s one we’re trying to get done … we’re hoping for good news on that one.” Birmingham name three debutants in their starting XI. Kyōgo, formerly of Celtic, starts up front, while Bright Osayi-Samuel and Phil Neumann line up at the back. Demarai Gray makes his second debut for his boyhood club, having since played for Leicester, Bayer Leverkusen, Everton and Al-Ittifaq. Ipswich have one new name in their starting line-up: midfielder Azor Matusiwa. Ashley Young, 40 last month, is on the bench waiting for his first start since his move from Everton. Birmingham City: Allsop, Samuel, Klarer, Neumann, Cochrane, Paik, Iwata, Anderson, Stansfield, Gray, Furuhashi. Subs: Beadle, Laird, Bielik, Cashin, Leonard, Doyle, Gardner-Hickman, Willumsson, Dykes. Ipswich Town: Palmer, Johnson, O’Shea, Greaves, Davis, Ogbene, Taylor, Matusiwa, Jack Clarke, Szmodics, Hirst. Subs: Walton, Kipre, Woolfenden, Chaplin, Young, Al Hamadi, Humphreys, Broadhead, Barbrook. Referee: Andrew Kitchen (Durham). Birmingham City and Ipswich Town return to the Championship tonight, albeit from different directions, and possibly therefore in different moods. Birmingham slummed it in League One last season, racking up 111 points on their way to the second third-tier title in their history; meanwhile Ipswich, having reached the Premier League arguably ahead of schedule, won just four games all season and were cashiered back from whence they came. Ipswich’s sorry fate won’t have any bearing on the ambitions of these two clubs. Town want to bounce back to the top flight immediately, and are the short-priced favourites to win this division; Birmingham fancy following in Ipswich’s footsteps, given the Tractor Boys were the last team to leap from League One to the Premier League with successive promotions, and they’re third-favourites in the race for glory. Everyone can work out how to stay in the Premier League when they get there. An exciting way to begin the Championship season, then. The match kicks off at 8pm UK time, and if we can get through the entire evening without reference to either Tom Brady or Ed Sheeran that’ll also be great.
