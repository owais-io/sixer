  The climate crisis is driving a sharp rise in dengue fever cases across the
  Pacific islands, experts say, as infections hit their highest level in a
  decade and several countries declare emergencies. Pacific Island countries and
  territories have reported 16,502 confirmed cases and 17 deaths since the start
  of 2025, according to the Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System (PSSS), which
  collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies.
  Infections across the region are at the highest level since 2016, the WHO
  said. Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are among the worst affected. Dr Paula Vivili,
  deputy director general of the Pacific Community (SPC), said historically
  dengue outbreaks were seasonal. “However, due to climate change, transmission
  seasons are lengthening, and some areas are experiencing year-round dengue
  risk,” Vivili said. Dengue fever, a viral illness spread by Aedes mosquitoes,
  causes high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and in severe
  cases can be fatal. Rising temperatures, rainfall and increased humidity are
  creating ideal breeding conditions for Aedes mosquitoes, even in areas
  previously unsuitable for transmission. “Dengue is one of the first real
  disease-related phenomena that we can lay at the foot of climate change,” said
  Dr Joel Kaufman, epidemiologist and director of the Center for Exposures,
  Diseases, Genomics and Environment at the University of Washington. “Rainfall
  raises the waterline over mosquito eggs laid just above the surface, which
  then hatch – that’s part of the natural breeding cycle. Heavy rains can also
  increase stagnant water sources, creating more opportunities for mosquitoes to
  breed,” he said. Kaufman warned these outbreaks pointed to a wider public
  health challenge. “It is in the vanguard of what will certainly be many types
  of human disease that become more common and more serious as the planet
  warms.” Since declaring an outbreak in April, Samoa has confirmed six
  dengue-related deaths, including two siblings, and more than 5,600 cases. This
  year Fiji has recorded eight deaths and 10,969 cases. Tonga has reported over
  800 cases and three deaths since declaring an outbreak in February. These
  outbreaks underscore the region’s vulnerability to climate-sensitive diseases,
  which are expected to intensify as global temperatures rise. Pacific Island
  countries produce just 0.03% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to
  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but face some of the
  most severe climate-related health threats, including vector-borne diseases.
  Recent months have brought extreme rainfall to parts of the Pacific including
  Palau, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, while severe drought has gripped
  parts of the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Nauru and Fiji, according to
  the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).
  Forecasts show these contrasts will continue into October. Although higher
  rainfall has been attributed to ideal conditions for mosquito breeding,
  Kaufman said that extreme weather events can also increase transmission of
  mosquito-borne diseases. Seriously dry or very dry conditions were recorded
  across large parts of the Pacific in the first half of the year, according to
  NIWA. “We might have thought the dryness would reduce mosquito-borne
  infections, but it seems that’s not what happens,” Kaufman said. “Instead,
  there’s an acceleration of transmission.”Across the Pacific, national
  responses have varied. Samoa, Cook Islands and American Samoa have declared
  emergencies. The Cook Islands has conducted island-wide clean-ups, intensified
  surveillance and targeted spraying. Tonga has worked with the WHO to bolster
  its outbreak response in its worst-hit islands, while Tuvalu has turned to
  social media and health campaigns to promote preventive measures. Samoa has
  held school clean-ups and boosted public health messaging. New Zealand has
  sent a clinical team and NZ$300,000 ($178,000) worth of medical supplies to
  Samoa, alongside on-the-ground personnel and ongoing coordination with Samoan
  health officials. But experts say these measures are being undermined by
  inadequate surveillance. “Current disease surveillance systems are rarely
  sufficient to manage dengue, as evidenced by the continual growth of dengue in
  the region, and more generally globally,” said Dr Bobby Reiner, disease
  ecologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University
  of Washington. Mosquito control tools are methods used to reduce the
  population of Aedes mosquitoes that spread dengue, such as removing breeding
  sites, applying larvicides or spraying insecticides. They can also include
  biological controls, personal protection measures and community clean-up
  campaigns to prevent mosquito bites and transmission. Still, Reiner said many
  mosquito control tools had never been proven to reduce transmission, with most
  responses reactive and often “wastefully chasing the outbreak, applying effort
  too late”.
