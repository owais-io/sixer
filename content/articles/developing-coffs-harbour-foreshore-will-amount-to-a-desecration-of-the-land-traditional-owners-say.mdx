  traditional owners say

  Traditional owners in Coffs Harbour are fighting against a “heartbreaking”
  proposal to build a six-storey private housing development near cultural
  heritage sites, in a project the state government says will “revitalise” the
  city’s foreshore. The proposal, still in the early planning stages, would see
  up to 250 residential dwellings and 200 short-stay units built on two
  “underutilised” lots within the 60-hectare foreshore precinct, subject to
  planning approvals. Property and Development NSW (PDNSW), the central property
  agency for the New South Wales government, is leading the process and says the
  development would “create a thriving economic hub by co-locating tourism,
  housing and non-residential uses” and include “shops, boardwalk cafes,
  restaurants, markets, entertainment, and water-themed play areas”.
  Gumbaynggirr Elder Uncle Reginald Craig, however, believes the plans equate to
  “desecration of the land”. “This is land on which we have lived and roamed for
  thousands of years, it would be heartbreaking to see it developed,” says
  Craig, a representative of the Garlambirla Guuyu-girrwaa Elders Group. A
  multi-level residential development is “inappropriate” in close proximity to a
  “web of sacred sites”, he says. Craig, now in his 70s, grew up surfing the
  beach breaks of the foreshore, and recalls Gumbaynggirr people living “amongst
  the environment, in the sand hills”. A draft Aboriginal Cultural Heritage
  Assessment Report, prepared for PDNSW by archaeological consultants Artefact
  Heritage and Environment, refers to “a number of highly significant Aboriginal
  Ceremony and Dreaming sites” within the precinct, including middens, a stone
  quarry and potential burial sites. • Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s
  fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter One potential site – assessed as
  being “likely to contain Pleistocene deposits”, which are between 50,000 and
  11,700 years old – was listed as being potentially impacted by proposed new
  infrastructure, as was a possible burial site where quartz artefacts were
  located. None of the significant sites identified sit directly within the
  footprint of the proposed residential development. Parts of the precinct are
  currently subject to two undetermined Aboriginal land claims. One significant
  site within the precinct boundary is the heritage-listed “Ferguson’s Cottage”,
  which became a safe haven for local children during the 1960s, and a refuge
  for Aboriginal people moved off missions. Another key site is a fenced-off
  area of land known as “Happy Valley”, which sits just outside the boundary of
  the proposed development, and has served as a campsite for Gumbaynggirr people
  for thousands of years. The site continues to be inhabited today and was the
  subject of a successful land claim by the Coffs Harbour and District Local
  Aboriginal Land Council in 2022. Christopher Mercy, who has lived at Happy
  Valley for 21 years, says he is largely unaware of the details of development
  plans and claims to have received no contact from the state government
  regarding the proposal. “I would have expected someone to come and have a yarn
  with me,” he says. PDNSW began consultation in 2019 and more than 3,600 people
  provided feedback on the initial master plan for the project in 2022. That
  same year, PDNSW engaged Aboriginal engagement specialists Murawin to
  coordinate a series of consultations with the Gumbaynggirr people. According
  to the resulting report, 50 community members engaged with the process, many
  repeatedly. A majority were “strongly opposed” to six-storey build heights and
  offered objections to the use of land for private residential accommodation.
  Aunty Yvette Pacey, the former chairperson of the Coffs Harbour and District
  Local Aboriginal Land Council, says the consultation process has felt
  predetermined. “I have spent more than 12 years with these people, trying to
  convince them of the importance of the site, that we need to have cultural
  spaces preserved, and no one is listening,” she says. According to PDNSW, the
  strategic plan makes consideration for the protection of significant cultural
  sites including Ferguson’s Cottage, Happy Valley and the nearby Muttonbird
  Island (Giidany Miirlarl). A rezoning proposal is currently being assessed by
  the Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure. The project has yet to
  be referred for cultural heritage and environmental assessment. The proposed
  redevelopment, introduced by the Coalition and picked up by Labor after the
  2023 state election, has the firm support of the Coffs Harbour MP Gurmesh
  Singh. Despite regular protests locally, he told NSW parliament last month
  that “most residents quietly support the project, even if they have been
  drowned out by the noisy minority”. “For decades, the Jetty Foreshores has
  been the subject of plans that never got off the ground,” Singh told Guardian
  Australia. “The plan is the most modest of all the plans proposed so far, and
  both the former Coalition Government and the current Labor Government have
  committed that all proceeds raised from the precinct will be spent improving
  the precinct.” Singh says the foreshore is “underused”, “tired” and doesn’t
  reflect the potential of Coffs Harbour. The proposal also has the backing of
  the current pro-development mayor and a majority of local councillors, despite
  the results of a poll – organised by the previous anti-development council for
  the local government election day last year – which asked residents if they
  agreed that some foreshore land should be used for multi-level private
  development. Some 68% of the 33,161 respondents answered no. The Coffs Harbour
  mayor, Nikki Williams, says the poll “lacked context and didn’t explain the
  full proposal”. “It’s impossible to identify community support for a full
  precinct master plan in one question,” she says. Williams says the proposed
  redevelopment would add “high-quality, medium-density homes in the right
  location” which would have “a positive impact across the entire housing
  spectrum”. Coffs Harbour is one the state’s worst housing stress hotspots.
  According to the New South Wales Regional Housing Need Report 2023, developed
  by the Regional Australia Institute and Shelter NSW, Coffs Harbour has the
  fourth highest housing needs of any regional local government area in the
  state. Pete’s Place, a local homelessness engagement hub, sees 70-120 people
  daily. Its team leader, Gai Newman, says housing availability and
  affordability – made worse by a succession of natural disasters – are key
  drivers of housing stress in the region. There is no explicit provision for
  affordable housing in the proposed foreshore development. The Labor councillor
  Tony Judge says the proposal would “change the whole character of the area”.
  “Everything we enjoy doing will be overlooked by 25-metre blocks of flats,” he
  says. Douglas Connor is a journalist and editor on the NSW mid-north coast
