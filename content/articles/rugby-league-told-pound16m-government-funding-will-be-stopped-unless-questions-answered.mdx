  The Rugby Football League has been told it will not receive the next
  instalment of government funding due next month unless it addresses concerns
  in Westminster about the sport’s governance. Officials from Sport England are
  due to meet the RFL leadership team of the interim chair, Nigel Wood, and
  chief executive, Tony Sutton, this week to address the issue, with the next
  payment of a £16m government funding package at risk. During preliminary
  discussions to arrange the meeting, the RFL was informed it will not receive
  next month’s payment without providing satisfactory answers regarding recent
  changes to its board to Sport England, which will be represented by its chair,
  Chris Boardman, and interim chief executive, Phil Smith. Sport England is
  understood to believe that the RFL’s decision to install Wood as interim chair
  may have breached the Code for Sports Governance, as it does not appear to
  have followed an “open and transparent” recruitment process. Complying with
  the code, which sets out minimum standards regarding transparency, diversity
  and inclusion, accountability and integrity, is a prerequisite for governing
  bodies seeking government and National Lottery funding. An RFL spokesperson
  said: “The RFL is working with Sport England on a governance action plan,
  following resignations from the board earlier in 2025, which required
  transitional arrangements. “We appreciate the need for Sport England to
  reassure themselves that our response will remain fully compliant with the
  Code for Sports Governance – the new RFL board are totally committed to this.
  “The outstanding work that is delivered by the sport, made possible partly by
  Sport England funding, continues unaffected.” Government money is critical to
  rugby league, the finances of which have been stretched in recent years by the
  impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the collapse in the value of its main
  broadcast deal with Sky Sports, which is paying the Super League clubs around
  half what it was five years ago to televise their matches. Salford are
  fighting for their future following a disastrous takeover that has left them
  with just two senior players due to the repeated late payment of wages, which
  has led to several of their games being cancelled, including a Super League
  fixture. The RFL receives £16m over five years from government in a deal
  managed by Sport England, with the money used to fund the elite end of the
  sport, as represented by England’s international teams, and the development of
  the grassroots and recreational game. Sport England’s concerns revolve around
  the processes involved in the return of Wood after the resignation of the
  former RFL chair Simon Johnson and three other directors this year. Wood was
  previously RFL chief executive for 11 years and received a £300,000 severance
  package after his departure in 2018, which accounted for almost one-sixth of
  the governing body’s losses at the time. The Code for Sports Governance states
  the chairs of governing bodies must be independent, but Wood was chair of the
  Championship club Bradford before being appointed. While he has relinquished
  that role at Bradford he retains a significant minority stake in the club,
  according to Companies House. Wood initially returned to the RFL in March as
  senior executive director and has since been appointed chair of Rugby League
  Commercial, the body that manages the sport’s broadcasting and sponsorship
  sales. In addition to Wood’s links to Bradford, Sport England is expected to
  ask questions about the processes involved in his appointment, and whether any
  other candidates were interviewed. In March RFL sources insisted it would not
  be a long-term arrangement, but that does not appear to be the case. Since
  returning to the RFL Wood has been instrumental in driving through an
  expansion of Super League from 12 to 14 clubs for next season, although Hull
  FC, Hull KR and Wigan Warriors failed to endorse the plan when it was voted
  through by the other nine clubs last month. In another twist Bradford are one
  of the clubs pushing to be promoted from the Championship to the expanded
  Super League, which has raised eyebrows given Wood’s previous role. As the
  Guardian revealed last month, Sky Sports has also yet to endorse the expansion
  and has made it clear it will not provide additional funding for the extra
  clubs to cover the final season of its three-year TV deal, which expires at
  the end of next season. In addition, it is unclear who will cover the
  approximate £500,000 cost of televising an extra game across 27 rounds next
  season. Some Championship clubs vying for promotion as part of expansion plans
  have indicated they are willing to enter Super League without central funding
  next season, which has raised further concerns about its competitiveness in
  the light of the Salford debacle. Salford were thrashed 80-6 by Hull FC last
  week before the fixture on Sunday against Wakefield was cancelled due to
  concerns over the safety of the younger players and triallists they were
  planning to field. Salford’s owner, Dario Berta, has said the club will not go
  bust. They are due in court next month over an unpaid tax bill of almost
  £700,000. • This article was amended on 18 and 20 August 2025. Nigel Wood is a
  senior executive director, not a “senior independent director”, of the RFL and
  is not on the Bradford club’s board as stated in an earlier version. Also,
  while Salford have cancelled several games, only one of them has been a Super
  League fixture; and the financial situation of the club, and others in the
  Super League, is not directly linked to Sport England funding as previously
  suggested.
