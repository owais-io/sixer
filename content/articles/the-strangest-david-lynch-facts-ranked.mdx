  7. He kept dead mice in his freezer David Lynch was an artist first, and a
  film-maker second (later, he’d also be a photographer, a songwriter and
  musician, a furniture designer and many other things). He would create works
  of visual art right up to his final days, but the most infamous would remain
  his “kits” – a pair of pieces he made in the late 1970s and early 80s, in
  which parts of a real, dissected animal (first a fish, then a chicken) were
  pinned to a board, along with kid-friendly instructions on how to reassemble
  and play with it. Later he would tell an interviewer that he was in the early
  stages of planning a mouse kit, with the requisite parts bagged up in his
  freezer. Sadly, this never came to pass, but Lynch would continue to use
  unusual objects – from dead bees to cigarette ashes – in his artworks over the
  coming decades. 6. He adopted, befriended and then ghosted five Woody
  Woodpeckers In 1981, Lynch was driving past a gas station on Sunset Boulevard
  when he noticed five stuffed Woody Woodpecker dolls hanging from a hook in the
  window. Executing a sharp U-turn, he went in to buy them. Naming them Bob,
  Dan, Pete, Buster and Chucko, he would keep them in his office, to make him
  happy. “These guys aren’t just a bunch of goofballs,” he would insist. “They
  know there is plenty of suffering in the world … But they tell me there’s a
  pervading happiness underneath everything, and the more time I spend with
  them, the more I believe it.” Sadly, the friendship couldn’t last – when the
  dolls began exhibiting “certain traits” that were “not so nice”, Lynch and his
  boys had to part ways. 5. He very nearly directed the third Star Wars movie
  The list of unproduced David Lynch projects is long and varied, but perhaps
  the most infamous is the film that came to be titled Return of the Jedi. After
  The Elephant Man and its eight Oscar nominations, Lynch was suddenly the hot
  new director on the block, with offers coming in from, among others, Star Wars
  mastermind George Lucas. They had a meeting to discuss the project, and Lynch
  always said that he called Lucas right away to say a firm no, and urge him to
  direct the movie himself. However, writer Max Evry recently revealed that, in
  fact, the discussions continued for some time, and Lynch remained Lucas’s top
  choice for several weeks after their meeting, only turning him down when the
  contracts came through for another sandy space saga – the ill-fated Dune. And
  it’s probably for the best – the thought of Lynch let loose in Jabba the
  Hutt’s palace is deeply unsettling. 4. He gave himself a hernia laughing at
  Angelo Badalamenti trying to sing During a recording session for a track
  featured on the soundtrack of his 1992 masterpiece Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With
  Me, Lynch laughed so hard at his close friend and musical partner, composer
  Angelo Badalamenti, that he ended up in hospital with a severe hernia. The
  track they were working on – pounding jazz-funk droner “A Real Indication” –
  required Badalamenti to speak-sing Lynch’s lyrics in a growling, booming,
  wildly over-enunciated pseudo-Midwestern accent, which the director found so
  hysterical he did himself a serious injury. It was worth it, though – the
  soundtrack is regularly voted among the best of all time. 3. He produced a
  whole album of 12th century religious music In the mid-1990s, despite the
  aforementioned hernia, Lynch was becoming ever more involved in writing,
  playing and producing music. It would be 2011 before Lynch would finally
  release an album of self-penned tracks under his own name, but in the meantime
  he’d embark on a number of musical explorations, from electric blues outfit
  BlueBOB, to the records he made with Texas-born chanteuse Chrystabell. But
  perhaps the oddest is Lux Vivens, or Living Light, an album credited to Lynch
  and Jocelyn Montgomery, formerly of Britain’s own sultry goth madrigal outfit,
  Miranda Sex Garden. Obsessed with the music of 12th-century German nun
  Hildegard Von Bingen, Montgomery persuaded Lynch to collaborate with her on an
  LP of Von Bingen’s spiritual songs, crafting a series of choral hymns backed
  by drones built from violin, guitar and manipulated “found sounds”, including
  swords and bulls. 2. He was totally obsessed with Mad Men Having been
  suspicious of television when he was younger (except for legal drama Perry
  Mason, which he loved) in the last decades of his life Lynch became a big fan
  of TV drama. It may have helped that he basically reinvented the format with
  Twin Peaks, and every show that came after it – from The Sopranos to Lost to
  Breaking Bad – owed him a huge debt. But his favourite show in this period was
  60s-set ad-exec drama Mad Men. Lynch became so emotionally engaged with it
  that when he met series stars Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss, he was unable to
  call them by their names, and instead simply referred to them as their
  characters, Don and Peggy. “We went with it,” Moss would reveal later, though
  it seems Lynch didn’t give them much choice. 1. He hated big tables Lynch was
  a builder – of worlds, of dreams, of furniture. As a kid he would undertake
  construction projects with his dad, learning how to use tools and mend fences,
  and in later life he would find employment as a house-builder, interior
  decorator and plumber. (“It’s a very satisfying thing,” he would say, “to
  direct water succesfully.”) Having built most of the props for his early,
  experimental films – including the mutant baby in his debut feature
  Eraserhead, whose precise components remain a mystery, though everything from
  umbilical cords to rabbit foetuses have been suggested – Lynch would later
  turn to crafting his own furniture, sometimes for a film shoot (several of his
  pieces appear in Lost Highway) and sometimes just for fun. He did, however,
  have strong opinions about what did and didn’t make an acceptable item of
  furniture. “Most tables are too big,” he would complain, “and they’re too
  high. They shrink the size of the room … and cause unpleasant mental
  activity.” • David Lynch: His Work, His World by Tom Huddleston is published
