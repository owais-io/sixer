  Wayne Rooney has bitten back at Tom Brady over comments aired in a recent
  documentary depicting their short spell working together at Birmingham. Brady,
  the legendary NFL quarterback and winner of seven Super Bowls, is heard during
  Built in Birmingham: Brady &amp; the Blues, to question Rooney when he was
  manager. “I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” Brady tells
  his business manager, Ben Rawitz. “I mean, I don’t have great instincts on
  that.” That follows a terse encounter between Rooney, the five-time Premier
  League winner and Manchester United record goalscorer, and Brady before they
  attend a meeting with the squad. Rooney was sacked after two wins in 15
  matches. Brady was at the training complex in his capacity as a minority
  owner, and as an adviser to the majority owner, Tom Wagner. “We’re trying to
  make this a world-class team,” Brady says in the introduction to a series that
  begins with the club’s relegation from the Championship. Rooney, relaunching
  his own media career with a BBC-affiliated podcast, has had his say. “I think
  Tom came in once, which was the day before a game where the days are a little
  bit lighter anyway, and I don’t think he really understood football that
  well,” he said. “But what he does understand is … he’s a hard worker – we know
  that.” Rooney defended his short spell in the second city, saying: “When I
  went into Birmingham, they were in a mess really. Hence the fact that the
  players weren’t really the players who could take the club forward. You had
  Tony Mowbray, Gary Rowett after me, who also struggled as well.” Brady is also
  heard to refer to Birmingham players from the 2023‑24 relegation campaign as
  “lazy and entitled”. The documentary’s brief meeting of the pair appears to be
  a case of two former sportsmen taking their next career steps and struggling
  to find the other’s wavelength. Rooney said: “Football is not NFL – NFL works
  for three months a year. Players do need rest as well, so I think he’s very
  unfair, the way he’s come out and portrayed that.” Brady, as a serial winner,
  would have played seasons spanning from September to February. Last season,
  Rooney was briefly the manager at Plymouth while Birmingham, after a summer of
  heavy spending, were promoted under Chris Davies as champions, collecting a
  record 111 points. Rooney was happy to offer credit for that revival. “I
  respect Tom Brady massively,” he said. “He’s one of the greatest, if not the
  greatest, athletes of all time and Birmingham do look like they’re getting it
  right now, which is good, and I think what they have done is got the players
  out that they needed to get out.” Birmingham were bought out by the Wagner-led
  consortium Knighthead Capital Management in the summer of 2023 and Brady
  became a shareholder two months later.
