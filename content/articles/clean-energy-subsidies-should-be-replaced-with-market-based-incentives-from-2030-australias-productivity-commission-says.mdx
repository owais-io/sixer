  The Productivity Commission says clean energy subsidy programs should not be
  extended beyond 2030, and that “market-based incentives” should guide
  investment in the clean energy transition over the coming decades. The
  commission’s interim report on investing in cheaper, cleaner energy and the
  net zero transformation is one of five which will be released over two weeks
  and which set out a series of reforms to reinvigorate Australia’s
  productivity. The commissioner Barry Sterland said: “Australia’s net zero
  transformation is well under way.” “Getting the rest of the way at the lowest
  possible cost is central to our productivity challenge,” he said. The
  commission stopped short of repeating previous recommendations for a broad
  price on carbon. But it advocated for a significant expansion of the safeguard
  mechanism, which sets emission limits for only the heaviest polluters, by
  slashing the threshold from 100,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide
  equivalent a year. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Chris Bowen, the climate
  change and energy minister, last week announced an increase in taxpayer
  subsidies available for green energy projects under its successful capacity
  investment scheme. The CIS and the government’s other clean energy subsidy
  scheme, the renewable energy target, do not extend beyond 2030, and the
  commission argued that the two programs should be replaced with “market-based
  incentives in the electricity sector”. The commission also said the
  implementation of the new vehicle efficiency standard meant federal and state
  governments should phase out specific concessions for electric vehicles,
  including on fringe benefits tax, stamp duties and registration fees. A new
  emissions-reduction incentive for heavy vehicles should also be introduced,
  the commission said. The commission said it took too long to develop green
  energy infrastructure and there were deep concerns that the government would
  not reach its 2030 climate targets, which include 82% of energy production
  from renewable sources. The report called for an overhaul of how green energy
  projects are assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
  Conservation Act, to allow decision-makers to consider whether a project is
  important to Australia’s clean energy transition. Martin Stokie, a
  commissioner who is leading the inquiry alongside Sterland, said Australia’s
  “sluggish and uncertain approval processes are not up to the task” of
  delivering the huge amount of clean energy infrastructure needed to meet
  national climate targets. “Overdue reforms to the EPBC Act would both speed up
  approvals and better protect the environment,” he said. The environment
  minister, Murray Watt, is reviewing the act as part of a new package of
  federal nature laws, which were shelved before the election after lobbying
  from mining companies and the Western Australian government. The commission
  also made a series of recommendations to build the country’s resilience to the
  effects of the climate emergency. The interim report called on the
  commonwealth to lead development of a public database of all climate hazards,
  and a series of goals and policies to improve the resilience of houses.
  Notably, the commission backed a climate resilience star-rating system that
  would reflect the potential damage from the climate crisis. “People’s
  experience of climate change will depend on the resilience of their home, but
  most lack the information they need to invest in upgrades,” Sterland said. “As
  climate risks intensify, boosting our resilience can lower the costs of
  disaster recovery and create a healthier, safer and more productive
  Australia.” The commission will now consult on its draft recommendations
  before the final report due at the end of this year.
