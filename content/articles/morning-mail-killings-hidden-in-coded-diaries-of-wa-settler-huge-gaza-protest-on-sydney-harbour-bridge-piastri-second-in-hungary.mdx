  Good morning. Our lead story today is a new investigation into coded diary
  entries from a Western Australian pastoralist. They describe a number of
  killings of Yamatji people in the 1850s, confirming knowledge passed down
  through Yamatji Naaguja families for generations. Descendants on both sides
  say it’s time to break the cycle of shame and silence. We report from the
  massive crowd of pro-Palestine protesters who made their feelings about the
  Gaza crisis clear by marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge yesterday. And
  the Hungarian F1 grand prix went down to the wire with Oscar Piastri beaten by
  just seven tenths of a second. Australia ‘This is a big moment’ | At least
  100,000 rain-soaked Sydney Harbour Bridge marchers, young and old, came in
  full force on Sunday to protest against Israel’s conduct in Gaza and to speak
  out about the children starving there. Anne Davies writes that the turnout
  highlights a failure of judgment by the usually slick NSW premier, Chris
  Minns. Exclusive | In a submission to the party’s election postmortem, the
  Young Liberals are urging the Coalition to distance itself from Sky News – and
  blame a “Maga mirage” for Peter Dutton’s election rout. Housing crisis | New
  data has laid bare how a lack of stable long-term housing means more
  Australian families are seeking crisis accommodation options to escape the
  grip of homelessness. ‘Ecosystem engineers’ | Almost 150 brush-tailed bettongs
  have been released at a sanctuary at Mount Gibson near Perth, in a move aiming
  to help the endangered species both survive and thrive. So long, Irene | Home
  and Away actor Lynne McGranger has won the Gold Logie award for most popular
  personality on Australian television as she ends her 32-year run playing Irene
  Roberts. World Gaza crisis | Israeli forces have killed at least 27
  Palestinians at a food site while the family of an Israeli hostage held in
  Gaza accuses Hamas of starving him. The British government will evacuate
  seriously ill and injured children from Gaza to the UK for treatment under a
  scheme to be announced within weeks. Russia-Ukraine war | A Ukrainian drone
  attack on an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi has ignited
  a raging fire, as the two sides traded strikes in one of the deadliest weeks
  in recent months. US politics | An irate Donald Trump has told Chuck Schumer
  to “GO TO HELL!” after a Senate standoff over confirmations; White House
  officials rushed to defend Trump after a shaky economic week; and bizarre
  public appearances have again cast doubt on Trump’s mental acuity, Adam
  Gabbatt writes. Royal family | As a biography of the Duke of York claims
  “punches were thrown” in a heated argument, Prince Harry has denied he gave
  Prince Andrew “a bloody nose” at a family gathering in 2013. Child rescued | A
  New Zealand woman was arrested after travelling on a bus with a two-year-old
  girl trapped in her luggage, after the bus driver became concerned about a bag
  moving during a stop. In-depth The coded diary entries of Major Logue, an
  early settler of the Geraldton region of Western Australia, flash up on the
  microfilm archives of the Battye Library in Perth. On 4 April 1852, he wrote
  in scrawling longhand that he and a group of other men had set out after
  breakfast in search of “the natives who had taken the cattle”, eventually
  finding and crawling up to a campsite. Then, in a modified version of the
  Freemason’s code, he wrote: “fired both barrels of my gun and wounded one
  fellow in the rump. Thomson and Dicky shot one dead.” The diary entries tell a
  bloody story of Australia’s frontier, and one which colonial families in the
  Geraldton region have only just begun to come to terms with. Guardian
  Australia is exploring these stories in a new series called The Descendants.
  Full Story The Descendants episode 1: decoding a massacre Colonial pastoralist
  Major Logue is a figure of note in the city of Geraldton, Western Australia.
  But his diaries, written partly in code, reveal a dark and confronting chapter
  of Australia’s past – a history that Yamatji people already know all too well.
  In this two-part special Full Story, Sarah Collard speaks to Lorena Allam
  about decoding the truth behind Logue’s diaries – and how descendants of
  colonial violence are coming together to heal from the horrors of the past.
  Not the news Brandon Jack’s Pissants are a group of Australian rules players
  relegated to the fringe of an unnamed footy team. They cushion themselves
  against humiliation and ego death by getting wasted, obsessing about their
  dicks, and treating women like disposable props. So, is the former AFL
  player’s debut novel a critique or a celebration of toxic masculinity? As
  Catriona Menzies-Pike writes, this is a book that cannot decide. Sport
  Motorsport | Lando Norris won a battle with his McLaren teammate, Australian
  driver Oscar Piastri, to take victory in a thrilling Hungarian F1 grand prix.
  AFL | The Brisbane Lions put a horror show behind them to thrive on the big
  stage, Jonathan Horn writes. Swimming | The US women set a world record in the
  medley relay at the swimming world championships, while Summer McIntosh won
  her fourth gold; and backstroke queen Kaylee McKeown pulled off another golden
  double. Cycling | Pauline Ferrand-Prévot wins the final stage and the yellow
  jersey in the Tour de France Femmes. Rugby union | Bundee Aki has revealed his
  wife gave birth to their daughter in the back of a car in New Zealand on the
  same day as the first Lions Test victory against Australia in Brisbane. Media
  roundup Scientists have developed a world-first mRNA vaccine in NSW that
  protects cows against foot-and-mouth disease, the Sydney Morning Herald
  reports. Victoria’s government is failing to enforce its own health guidelines
  for school canteens, the Age reports. An artificial reef is at the heart of
  plans to help revive fishing in South Australia after the toxic algae crisis,
  the Advertiser reports. What’s happening today NSW | A trial is set to begin
  for a western NSW health district accused of breaching duty of care under
