  Three states have moved to deploy hundreds of members of their national guard
  to the nation’s capital as part of the Trump administration’s effort to
  overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown. West Virginia
  said it was deploying 300 to 400 guard troops, while South Carolina pledged
  200 and Ohio said it would send 150 in the coming days. The moves announced on
  Saturday came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and
  national guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following
  Donald Trump’s executive order federalizing local police forces and activating
  about 800 District of Columbia national guard members. The office of West
  Virginia’s governor, Patrick Morrisey, said in a statement that the deployment
  was “a show of commitment to public safety and regional cooperation” and the
  state would provide equipment and “approximately 300-400 skilled personnel as
  directed”. The statement came after Donald Trump ordered hundreds of
  Washington DC national guard troops to mount a show of force and temporarily
  took over the city’s police department to curb what the president depicts as a
  crime and homelessness emergency in the nation’s capital. Data compiled by the
  DC police department shows that violent crime was actually at a 30-year low
  when Trump returned to office in January, and has declined a further 26% since
  then. Last weekend, Trump ordered the district’s homeless residents to leave,
  or face forcible relocation, after his motorcade passed a handful of unhoused
  people en route to his golf course outside the city. On Thursday, local
  officials cleared away one of the roadside encampments Trump had complained
  about, arguing that they could do so in a more humane fashion than untrained
  federal forces. A justice department order to replace the Washington police
  chief, Pamela Smith, with the DEA head, Terry Cole, as the city’s “emergency
  police commissioner” ran into problems after a challenge in federal court by
  the DC attorney general, Brian Schwalb. Without issuing a direct ruling on the
  challenge, US district judge Ana Reyes indicated that Smith had to remain in
  charge. But efforts to increase federal control of the district resumed on
  Saturday with the order to deploy West Virginia’s national guard. Drew Galang,
  a spokesperson for Morrisey, said the state’s national guard received the
  order to send equipment and personnel to DC late on Friday and was working to
  organize the deployment. A White House official told Reuters on Saturday that
  more national guard troops were being called in to Washington to “protect
  federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to
  carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter
  crime”. A protest against Trump’s intervention drew scores to Dupont Circle on
  Saturday before a march to the White House, about 1.5 miles away.
  Demonstrators assembled behind a banner that said, “No fascist takeover of
  DC”, and some in the crowd held signs saying, “No military occupation”.
  Fueling the protests were concerns about Trump overreach and that he had used
  crime as a pretext to impose his will on Washington. The Chamberlain Network,
  a veterans’ group that describes itself as “dedicated to protecting
  democracy”, commented on X that the order for West Virginia’s national guard
  to police DC was “pulling them away from their core mission of protecting our
  communities”. “From floods to winter storms, we count on our Guard on in a
  crisis,” the group said. “They should be home, ready to respond – not on a
  political policing mission.” Since arriving in Washington last week, about 800
  national guard troops under Trump’s direct control have served as a visible
  presence in public areas, assigned to administrative and logistical duties as
  well as “area beautification” work, according to the Wall Street Journal.
  Defense officials had said they would not be carrying weapons but “weapons are
  available if needed but will remain in the armory,” the US army said in a
  press release. A US official told Reuters that a formal order authorizing the
  national guard troops to carry firearms would be issued but it would largely
  affect military police officers with sidearms. The White House also said on
  Saturday that national guard in DC are conducting patrols on foot and in
  vehicles around the national mall and Union Station, adding that the troops
  were not making arrests at this time. Trump has indicated that he may take
  similar actions in other Democratic-controlled cities. A federal judge in San
  Francisco is expected in the coming weeks to issue a ruling on whether Trump
  violated the law by deploying national guard troops to Los Angeles in June
  without the approval of California’s governor, Gavin Newsom. Typically the
  national guard is deployed only in instances where a state governor requests
  it. However, the DC national guard reports directly to the president.
