  The second round of Women’s Champions League qualifying gets under way on
  Wednesday with several notable teams entering, among them Manchester United,
  Brann, Glasgow City and Roma. The winners of Wednesday’s semi-finals will
  progress to Saturday’s finals and play for a place in mid-September’s final
  round of qualifying. Here are eight players to keep an eye on this week. Julia
  Zigiotti (Manchester United): With Fridolina Rolfö continuing to recover from
  the injury that hampered her at Euro 2025, plenty of eyes will be on her
  compatriot and now club-mate Zigiotti. The Swede was United’s other marquee
  signing this summer and brings a wealth of experience. The tenacious defensive
  midfielder arrived after a double-winning season with Bayern Munich and was at
  the heart of her country’s run to the quarter-finals in Switzerland. Zigiotti
  will be familiar to Women’s Super League fans from her two-year spell at
  Brighton. Her key qualities lie in her ability to link the transition from
  defence to attack as well as her quality in the press and work ethic. Her
  introduction will perhaps allow Dominique Janssen to return to her more
  natural defensive position. Riola Xhemaili (PSV): The midfielder wrote her
  name into the Swiss football history books this summer with a 92nd-minute
  equaliser against Finland that sent the hosts to their first European
  Championship quarter-final. Xhemaili made a permanent move to PSV after a
  successful loan from Wolfsburg last season and will be looking to take another
  big scalp with the Eredivisie side when they face United on Wednesday. She
  scored 10 goals and provided six assists in the last campaign and has become
  an integral part of Roeland ten Berge’s side. Oona Sevenius (Rosengård): Euro
  2025 spectators will remember Sevenius’s impact in an exciting Finland team.
  Her beautiful finish against Norway on her first start at a major tournament
  and the celebration that followed marked the 21-year-old as one to watch on
  the European stage. After some time in Italy and a loan at FC Como, the
  forward signed for Rosengård in January and has made 13 appearances this
  season. The Swedish team will be favourites to come through an opening tie
  with North Macedonia’s Ljuboten. Signe Gaupset (Brann): The midfielder’s
  career has been on a steep upward trajectory since she broke into Brann’s side
  in 2021 and shows no sign of slowing. One of the best youngsters in
  Switzerland this summer, the 20-year-old Norwegian produced a memorable
  display against Iceland, scoring twice and providing two assists. Gaupset is
  the jewel in Brann’s crown with 11 goals and eight assists registered in this
  season’s Toppserien and she will be looking forward to the challenge of
  breaking down Inter’s defence. Some of the top clubs in Europe will be trying
  to prise her away from the Bergen-based team, with whom in March she signed a
  new contract until 2027. Alayah Pilgrim (Roma): After significant battles with
  injury last season, the Switzerland international recovered to finish the
  campaign with Roma and earn her selection for Pia Sundhage’s Euro 2025 squad.
  The 22-year-old had to settle for being an impact player from the bench but
  made her mark on her major tournament bow with a goal in the 2-0 victory over
  Iceland. A forward with pace to burn, she is a problem for any defence and
  will be relishing the opportunity to run at the backline of Aktobe, a club
  from Kazakhstan. Smilla Holmberg (Hammarby): The right-back had a summer of
  contrasting fortunes. The joy of her standout performance and goal in Sweden’s
  4-1 demolition of Germany was followed by the agony of missing the penalty
  that sent England to the semi-finals. The dynamic 18-year-old is a star in the
  making with the potential to become the complete modern full-back. Her
  emergence at Hammarby has been sensational and she is one of the side’s most
  productive players in the Damallsvenskan this season. Roisin Molloy (Athlone
  Town): The Irish club’s inaugural appearance in Champions League qualifying
  brought a 4-0 victory over Cardiff City last month and the 23-year-old Molloy
  was a standout performer with two goals and an assist. The right-winger has
  been catching the eye domestically since signing for Athlone in 2021. She made
  18 starts last season and scored five goals as Colin Fortune’s side won their
  first league title and is continuing in a rich vein of form. The quality of
  the seasoned Icelandic champions Breiðablik will be the next challenge for the
  exciting midfielder. Erín McLaughlin (Glasgow City): The Republic of Ireland
  international moved to Glasgow on a three-year deal this summer after a season
  with Portsmouth. The 22-year-old midfielder has shown strong potential, her
  vision, technical ability and energy shining through in her performances at
  Peamount United and, last season, in the Championship. She has caught the eye
  of Carla Ward, who called her up for Ireland’s summer friendlies against the
  USA. Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any of our
