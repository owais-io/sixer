  It was almost midnight when Hameed Jan was jolted awake in his bed by a deep
  rumble. Powerful tremors were shaking his small house in Piran village, in
  Afghanistan’s Kunar region, and he could see the walls beginning to crack. “I
  jumped out of bed and rushed to where my children and parents were sleeping,”
  Jan said. “I managed to rescue two of my children and brought them outside to
  safety. I went back inside to save my younger siblings, but as I did the roof
  and walls collapsed around me.” As the magnitude-6 earthquake hit eastern
  Afghanistan late on Sunday night, Jan found himself buried in the rubble of
  his own house. As much as he tried to claw at the debris, he struggled to push
  his head through the wreckage. It took villagers five hours to finally free
  him. When he finally broke through, he was greeted with scenes of tragedy and
  devastation. His wife, two sons and two brothers were among the dead after the
  powerful earthquake had razed entire villages across the region to the ground.
  In the poverty-stricken, mountainous terrain of Kunar, most homes in the
  affected villages had been made only of mud, giving people little defence from
  the debris and floods caused by the earthquake when it struck as they slept.
  Most homes lay in piles of rubble or had been washed away entirely. “It felt
  as if the entire mountain was collapsing on us,” Jan said. “Our village has
  been completely devastated and residential areas wiped out.” The official
  death toll stood at 800 on Monday evening, with more than 2,500 injured, and
  was widely expected to rise significantly. Many in the villages of Kunar
  remained unaccounted for and rescuers continued to pull bodies from the rubble
  as all local hospitals declared a state of emergency. The Taliban, who took
  control of the country more than four years ago when its internationally
  recognised government collapsed, dispatched helicopters but many areas
  remained impossible to access. Sanaullah, another resident of Kunar province,
  had been away from his village when the earthquake struck. When he travelled
  back on Monday, he found that his house had been reduced to rubble and his
  brother had been killed alongside his five children. “It is the story of each
  and every house here,” he said. “Everyone I know here has lost at least three
  to five family members.” Abdul Rahim, a cleric in Kunar, said graveyards in
  Mazar valley in Kunar were now overflowing with the dead. “Everywhere people
  are crying and embracing one another following a mass funeral,” he said. “The
  death toll is so high that graveyards are overflowing, and local people are
  busy digging graves in advance as bodies arrive every half hour.” Many of
  those affected were critical of the rescue efforts by the Taliban, which was
  widely seen to lack the resources, manpower and funds to deal with a crisis on
  this scale. Since the Taliban retook power in 2021, it has become increasingly
  difficult for NGOs to operate in the country, particularly amid the draconian
  ban on women’s employment and education, and most foreign governments have
  withdrawn aid from Afghanistan, now one of the poorest countries in the world.
  Sohail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesperson, called on international organisations
  to step in and offer assistance in the wake of the disaster. “Many villages
  are not accessible yet,” he said. “I fear the casualties are very high.” One
  resident from the Maza Dara area, who asked to remain anonymous to speak
  freely, criticised the Taliban rescue efforts. “There are women and children
  pleading for help but there are no authorities present to help them,” he said.
  “Everyone is trapped under the rubble and we are helpless and seeing them
  dying in front of our eyes,” he added. “There is no one here to help those
  buried and alive in the debris. There is no one here to remove the dead.”
