  Labour thinktank offers sponsorship packages to meet and influence ‘key
  policymakers’

  A Labour thinktank has been offering sponsorship packages where businesses can
  meet and influence MPs and ministers, according to a report. The Labour
  Infrastructure Forum (LIF) has been offering companies the chance to sponsor
  events at which they can meet “key policymakers” in private and “shape the
  discussion”, the Times said. An LIF prospectus lists a set of sponsorship
  packages on offer for companies, including a £7,850 deal for a “private
  breakfast/dinner roundtable with an influential Labour figure”. Other deals on
  offer include £11,750 for a “parliamentary panel event with key policymakers”,
  and between £21,500 and £30,000 for a “Westminster drinks reception”. The
  prices are not inclusive of VAT. The LIF describes itself on its website as “a
  thinktank focused on getting Britain building and growing again”. It states
  that it wants to “spark dialogue” between the party and “those working across
  the infrastructure sector”. The thinktank was launched in September last year
  at an event with speeches from Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the
  Treasury, and Varun Chandra, a business adviser to Keir Starmer. It is not
  part of the Labour party and is not a lobbying company, which means it does
  not need to abide by the rules or guidance for lobbying firms or political
  parties. A spokesperson for the LIF told the Times that the group used
  sponsorship money to cover its costs and that “any LIF activity that is
  supported by sponsors will be made publicly available at the time and in our
  annual report, as is common across the industry”. The group does not disclose
  its sponsors. The Labour party said it had no connection to LIF and does not
  endorse its activities. “Commercial partnerships at events are a longstanding
  practice and have no bearing on party or government policy. The party fully
  complies with all rules relating to the reporting of donations,” a party
  spokesperson said. The LIF states that its secretariat and work is supported
  by the lobbying company Bradshaw Advisory. The Times reported that a client of
  Bradshaw Advisory had been able to have a meeting last year with Jonathan
  Reynolds, the business secretary, at the Labour party conference, which has
  not been declared on transparency records. A Labour party spokesperson said:
  “This was a meeting at party conference that was held in a political capacity.
  All meetings held in a ministerial capacity are declared in the proper way in
  full accordance with the rules.” Labour came under fire last autumn for
  offering company bosses breakfast with Reynolds for up to £30,000. For £15,000
  plus VAT, companies were told they would get an opportunity to give a keynote
  speech, photographs with the business secretary and others, and a dedicated
  member of Labour party staff to help make introductions. For £30,000 they
  would also get to help decide who would attend. In the pitch, Labour’s
  commercial team called the offer a “unique opportunity to become a commercial
  partner at our business policy roundtable over breakfast”. The event
  ultimately did not go ahead and the party said Reynolds had been unaware of
  it. The Guardian reported last month that some Labour MPs were alarmed at the
  number of sponsored corporate receptions for backbenchers that have been
  arranged by the party, amid concerns about perceived conflicts of interest.
  MPs said they had received invitations for networking receptions that include
  explicit advertisements for property developers or public affairs firms, sent
  directly from the parliamentary Labour party office.
