  With hundreds of wildfires burning out of control, Canada’s 2025 fire season
  is already the second-worst on record, as scientists report climate change is
  prolonging and exacerbating the burning, leading to more destruction,
  evacuations and smoke-filled skies. More than 470 fires across the country are
  currently classified as “out of control”, according to the Canadian
  Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). 7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada
  have burned due to wildfires this year – close to 78% more than the five-year
  average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC’s latest data. The 2025
  fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted
  in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned. “This is our new reality… the
  warmer it gets, the more fires we see,” said Mike Flannigan, the BC research
  chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at
  Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops. A June analysis on the 2025 fire
  season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan,
  concluded that the fires are a “stark manifestation” of climate change and
  that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above
  average. The warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the
  frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate
  also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and
  the forest floor – creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.
  “It means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the
  fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be
  difficult to impossible to extinguish,” he said. So far, the worst of the
  fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and
  Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far
  this year in Canada. Tens of thousands of people in communities across the
  country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the
  Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the
  province from over 6,700 households to evacuate. Thirteen communities in
  north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are
  First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of
  this year’s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern
  village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze. The season has also
  now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across
  Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders. John
  Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of
  California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations
  University. Abatzoglou said this year’s fire season is the third year in a row
  Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also
  causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as
  well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is
  also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond
  evacuations. It’s an international element of the fires that officials are
  having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said. “This is a really
  key point that’s different from other natural hazards and its ability to
  impact everything from quality of life to … human health and even mortality,”
  he said. Governments and public health officials will have to address how to
  change public behaviour and public policy to contend with “smoke days”, where
  you have to stay inside, he said. “I know communities that may not have great
  infiltration systems … so more efforts there to provide resources to
  communities so that they can be safe indoors during acute smoke periods.”
