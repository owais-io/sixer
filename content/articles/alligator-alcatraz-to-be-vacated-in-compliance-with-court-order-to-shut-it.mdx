  Florida’s immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” will probably be
  empty of detainees within days, a state official has said, indicating
  compliance with a judge’s order last week that the facility must close. The
  Republican governor Ron DeSantis’s administration appealed the order by
  federal court judge Kathleen Williams that the tented detention camp in the
  Florida Everglades, which attracted criticism for its harsh conditions, must
  be dismantled within 60 days. But in an email reported Wednesday by the
  Associated Press, Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida department
  of emergency management, which operates the jail on behalf of the federal
  government, appeared to confirm it would be shuttered. “We are probably going
  to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” Guthrie wrote to Mario
  Rojzman, a Miami Beach rabbi who has been helping to arrange chaplaincy
  services. Representatives for Rojzman confirmed the authenticity of the memo
  to the news agency. Guthrie’s office did not immediately respond to a request
  for comment. The Miami Herald had previously reported that hundreds of
  detainees were moved from “Alligator Alcatraz” to other immigration facilities
  in the state in advance of Williams’s ruling. On Monday, protesters who have
  maintained an almost permanent presence at the gates of the jail reported
  seeing convoys of buses driving out. Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democratic
  congressman, said that he was told during a tour last week that only about 300
  to 350 detainees remained. “Alligator Alcatraz” was touted by Donald Trump as
  a holding camp for up to 3,000 undocumented immigrants as they awaited
  deportation. The jail, he said, was reserved for “the most vicious people on
  the planet”. Since it opened in early July after being hastily constructed in
  late June at a remote disused airstrip about 50 miles (80km) west of Miami, it
  drew waves of criticism. Several lawsuits sought its closure, and there have
  been claims that hundreds of those detained had no criminal records or active
  proceedings against them. Williams’s ruling was a significant victory for a
  coalition of environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians, who
  claimed the camp had caused permanent and irreparable damage to the
  ecologically fragile wetland and its wildlife. Another lawsuit, filed by
  groups including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), claimed detainees
  were abused by jail staff, and that their human and constitutional rights were
  denied because they were refused access to attorneys and due process. The
  plaintiffs said the Everglades facility was not needed, especially because
  Florida plans to open a second immigration detention facility in the north of
  the state that DeSantis has dubbed “deportation depot”. Williams had not ruled
  by Wednesday on a request by attorneys for the state to stay her order of
  closure. In her original 82-page ruling, she said she expected the population
  of the facility to decline within 60 days by transferring detainees to other
  facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be
  removed. She wrote that the state and federal defendants could not bring
  anyone other than those who are already being detained at the facility onto
  the property. The environmental groups and Miccosukee tribe had argued in
  their lawsuit that further construction and operations should be stopped until
  federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their
  lawsuit claimed the facility reversed billions of dollars spent over decades
  on environmental restoration. State officials have signed more than $245m in
  contracts for building and operating the facility at a lightly used,
  single-runway training airport in the middle of the rugged and remote
  Everglades. The center officially opened on 1 July. In their lawsuits, civil
  rights attorneys described “severe problems” at the facility which were
  “previously unheard-of in the immigration system”. Detainees were being held
  for weeks without any charges, had disappeared from the online detainee
  locator maintained by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency
  (Ice), and nobody at the facility was making initial custody or bond
  determinations, they said. Detainees also described worms turning up in the
  food, toilets that did not flush, flooding floors with fecal waste, mosquitoes
  and other insects everywhere and malfunctioning air conditioning that
  alternated the temperature between near freezing and extreme heat.
