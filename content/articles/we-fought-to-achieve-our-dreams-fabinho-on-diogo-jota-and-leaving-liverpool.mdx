  Fabinho attended Diogo Jota’s funeral unable to believe it was all true. His
  Portuguese friend, with whom he played for three years at Liverpool, had died
  in a tragic accident alongside André Silva, his brother. The Brazilian found
  himself reflecting extensively on life and how everything can be lost in a
  fleeting moment. “It was very difficult to absorb because he had a routine and
  a life just like mine,” Fabinho says. “When that happens, you put yourself in
  that situation. We’ve lived through a period together. We fought to achieve
  our dreams. Professional dreams, but personal dreams too. We had a lot in
  common. And then you think about it. There’s no way round it. It makes you
  think that life is but a breath.” Fabinho is talking from Spain, preparing
  with Al-Ittihad for his third season in the Saudi Pro League. Since joining
  the Portuguese club Rio Ave at the age of 18, he has lived outside Brazil.
  Over the following 13 years, he has become accustomed to the rhythms of
  travelling and working in football, but Jota’s death has changed his outlook.
  “Whether you like it or not, you start to appreciate the details of your
  life,” he says. “I’m a guy who tries to make the most of the life I have with
  my family. I’m very grateful to God. But when something like this happens, you
  start to value even more what really matters.” At Liverpool Fabinho enjoyed
  the most successful years of his career. He won the Champions League in his
  first campaign and was again a key player the following season as the club
  secured a first top-flight title in 30 years. Leaving in 2023 was not easy.
  “Liverpool is a sensational club that helps us with everything,” he says. “Not
  just on the pitch but in your life too. Everything they’ve done for me and my
  family has been spectacular; I’ve never seen anything like it. Everywhere you
  go, not only in England, the supporters show a lot of love for the club and
  the players.” Fabinho’s departure surprised many. First, because of his
  perceived importance: he made 219 appearances in five years, almost always as
  a first choice. Second, because it was not common for high-profile players to
  leave the Premier League for Saudi Arabia. He details, for the first time,
  what influenced his decision. “I didn’t want to leave the club and go to any
  other club in Europe,” he says. “I thought it was the best place in the world
  to play, to keep developing as a player. I wanted my legacy and my history at
  the club to grow even more but our last season was very gruelling, tiring. We
  didn’t do well and failed to qualify for the Champions League. I lost my
  position as a starter for a few games, but that happens. “I came back for the
  following season, even though the previous one hadn’t been good, with a very
  good mentality and wanting to fight for the Premier League title again. But
  before the season started, Al-Ittihad made an offer for me and the Liverpool
  directors said it was very good for the club and for me. I was afraid and
  decided to wait to see what [the coaching staff] would say. I thought I was an
  important player and that they would refuse any offer, but I realised that the
  club was open to selling me.” Fabinho next asked Jürgen Klopp for his
  thoughts. The manager was a huge admirer, to the point that he had described
  Fabinho as one of the best No 6s in the world and criticised Tite for rarely
  using him for Brazil. The conversation they had came as a disappointment. “He
  called me and asked me what I wanted,” Fabinho says. “I said that I’d heard
  the offer and liked it but that I wanted to hear from him what he thought. He
  said that if there are any players who want to leave, he won’t hold them back.
  It was a speech that kind of opened the door for me to leave. That
  conversation with the coach could have kept me at the club but he left it open
  and I didn’t like it very much. I always like to do a prayer before I make my
  decisions. Liverpool is a club I love but the things that happened at the time
  steered my life towards Arabia. I left in peace and happy with my decision.”
  At Al-Ittihad, Fabinho has not lost his golden touch. In May a player who
  helped Monaco to a first league win in 17 years and was part of Liverpool’s
  long-awaited Premier League triumph celebrated the title with the Jeddah-based
  club, coached by Laurent Blanc. He last played for Brazil in December 2022 but
  dreams of a call-up from Carlo Ancelotti. “My goal is to play in the [2026]
  World Cup,” the 31-year-old says. “I’m working towards it. I performed very
  well last season. That made me very happy and I was able to show myself that I
  still have a lot of quality and that I can help the Brazilian national team.”
  Fabinho is also looking to the future and thinking about coaching. “I’m
  starting to take a more boring view of football. Boring isn’t the word; I
  think it’s more demanding. When you want to win, you have to be more
  demanding. I’m very demanding, I’ve had a lot of experience in my career and
  what has always helped me is my tactical vision and my game reading. “It’s
  something I enjoy. I like watching games, observing and studying. I don’t know
  if this will make me a coach, but it’s something I really like and want to
  work on. I’m going to do a course to become a coach. I started to study it
  when I was at Liverpool but I didn’t finish. I’m going to prepare for that.
  Whether or not I go on [to coach professionally], that’s another story.” He
  has role models to draw from if it comes to it. Despite not liking that chat
  with Klopp, the German remains his inspiration. “I really like Klopp’s idea,
  with his style that many people say is like rock’n’roll. It’s the style I’ve
  most enjoyed playing and watching. I have always been impressed by Tite as
  well. His set pieces are very good, he’s a coach who works a lot on the
  details. Today, with Blanc, I like the relationship he has with the players.
  He knows how to manage a team. But when people ask me who is my best coach I
  already had, I always say the coach I’ve won the most with. And that’s Klopp.”
  Fabinho has a year on his contract and extending that deal is among the
  possibilities under consideration. “I’m happy at Al-Ittihad, I really like
  here,” he says. “The Brazilian league is also an option – it is getting
  stronger and stronger – but I also want to go back to Europe. I want to play
  and fight for another Champions League title. The Premier League is still the
  best league in the world, but I think I’d prioritise another country that I
  haven’t had the chance to play in yet.”
