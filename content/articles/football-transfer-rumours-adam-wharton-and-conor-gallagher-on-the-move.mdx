  An old adage of the transfer window dictates that only desperate clubs do
  business in the final days before the deadline, so it’s a surprise to
  absolutely no one that Manchester United, West Ham and the Old Firm clubs are
  involved in today’s tittle-tattle. United, who have rejected Kobbie Mainoo’s
  request to leave on loan before Monday’s 7pm deadline, are fumbling around
  trying to get their midfield ducks in a row, having seen the current, er,
  ducks dominated by Grimsby. Carlos Baleba looks like a no-go this window but
  Adam Wharton is a midfielder admired by United – though that’s also viewed as
  a tricky deal to do. Crystal Palace will surely not be parting with the
  21-year-old having already lost Eberechi Eze and possibly Marc Guéhi too.
  Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid also like Wharton. Palace have been
  credited with an interest in their former loanee Conor Gallagher this window,
  but West Ham have since emerged as a possible destination for the
  Chelsea-reared midfield chaser. Why Gallagher would want to swap Atlético
  Madrid for a relegation battle in east London at this stage is unclear.
  Dimitri Colau, a 19-year-old centre-back from Paris FC, clearly fancies
  himself some Stratford East frostbite this winter as a West Ham switch is
  close. Manchester City’s Manuel Akanji looks as if he will be following
  Christopher Nkunku from the Premier League to AC Milan, Nathan Ake could also
  be leaving the Eithad, with Tottenham circling, while Manchester United are
  going to ship unwanted left-back Tyrell Malacia (remember him?) to Elche on
  loan. Marco Asensio to Aston Villa – this time it’s permanent! Or at least it
  could be if Villa meet Paris Saint-Germain’s asking price for the former Real
  Madrid man. The French giants aren’t interested in loaning Asensio out again.
  Lucas Paquetá and Borussia Dortmund’s Max Beier are also on Villa’s last-ditch
  shopping list. North of the border, with both Glasgow behemoths licking their
  wounds after failing to qualify for the Champions League, new recruits are
  most certainly required. Celtic are about to send striker Adam Idah to Swansea
  for £7m with Kasper Dolberg, somehow now 27 and holed up at Anderlecht, viewed
  as the ideal replacement. Russell Martin’s Rangers revolution has started in
  stuttering fashion but a loan deal for Everton’s Youssef Chermiti could change
  all that. Or not. There are a host of high-calibre forwards who have been
  perma-linked with transfers this window yet could be left in limbo as that
  pesky deadline looms nearer. Ademola Lookman and Rodrygo are premium wing
  talents but will anyone stump up the cash and sign them? Tottenham are
  unlikely to, despite speculation. Then there’s £150m pair Jadon Sancho and
  Antony at United; will either get a move? Maybe the latter. And what about
  Raheem Sterling? So many unanswered questions, so little time. There’s always
  the Saudi Pro League or the Turkish league, whose windows remain open until 10
  and 11 September respectively.
