  Talks on the world’s first legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution
  have stalled just one day before the negotiations are due to end. Some of the
  countries calling for an ambitious treaty to include targets to reduce plastic
  production, including Colombia, the EU and the UK, have rejected as
  “unacceptable” and “unambitious” a draft treaty text that does not include
  production caps, nor address chemicals used in plastic products. Almost 100
  countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and many African and Pacific
  nations, have called for the adoption of legally binding measures to limit
  plastic production in order to address plastic at source. Many have said toxic
  chemicals in plastics need to be controlled. The main sticking point at the
  talks, now in their third year, has been whether to cap plastic production or
  to focus on issues such as better design, recycling and reuse. But oil- and
  plastic-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, the
  “like-minded group” which has reportedly been supported by the US as well as
  the chemical industry, reject production limits and instead want the treaty to
  focus on measures such as waste management and recycling. At a meeting in
  Geneva on Wednesday, many countries rejected the latest treaty text presented
  by the chair, Luis Vayas Valdivieso. They said they were “extremely concerned”
  or “disappointed” by the low level of ambition it contained. Colombia’s
  delegate, Sebastián Rodríguez, rejected the draft text as “completely
  unacceptable”, while Julio Cordano, head of delegation for Chile, said it
  contained gaps and shortcomings which did not reflect the scale of the
  problem. Panama’s delegate, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, also said it could
  not accept the draft text as a basis of negotiation and that its red lines had
  been “spat on and burned”. The negotiators had “only 30 hours” to find a
  solution to end plastic pollution, not “just a political solution”, he added.
  “This is not ambition, it is surrender,” he said. The UK’s head of delegation,
  minister Emma Hardy, said the text was the “lowest common denominator”. “We
  need an effective treaty for our people and for our planet. Time is running
  out,” she said. The new draft contains one mention of plastic production, in
  the preamble reaffirming the importance of sustainable plastic production and
  consumption. An article on production from a previous draft has been removed.
  There is no mention of chemicals. A reference to the “full life cycle” of
  plastics in a previous draft has also been removed. Kenya described the draft
  as a “waste management” instrument, which had “no democratic value” for states
  seeking to limit plastic, while Mexico said it represented a “crisis in
  multilateralism”. Dennis Clare, a negotiator for Micronesia, said: “Some
  parties, including ours, are not even willing to engage on that text, it’s a
  step backward.” “It certainly seems like it was very biased toward the
  like-minded countries [Saudi, Russia, Iran etc]. There’s problems across the
  board. There’s no binding measures on anything. There’s no obligation to
  contribute resources to the financial mechanism. There’s no measures on
  production or chemicals. This text is just inadequate.” Speaking before the
  release of the chair’s text, Juan Carlos Lozada, a member of the house of
  representatives of Colombia, said: “If the production keeps growing at the
  rate it has grown in the last decades, we have no hope for 2050, 2060. So if
  the treaty doesn’t have those elements, those key elements, there’s no treaty.
  I’d rather not have a treaty if we’re not going to have a very robust treaty.”
  Andreas Bjelland, the head of Norway’s delegation, which is the co-chair of
  the high ambition coalition, also speaking before the release of the text,
  said: “To keep production as part of the finalised treaty, that is important.
  If you look at what we agreed on in the mandate … sustainable production and
  sustainable consumption was explicitly mentioned. So there should be
  provisions to be able to work with that and develop that over time.”
  Greenpeace described the new text as a “gift to the petrochemical industry and
  a betrayal of humanity”. Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation, said:
  “By failing to address production or harmful chemicals in any way, this text
  glorifies the industry lie that we can recycle our way out of this crisis,
  ignoring the root cause: the relentless expansion of plastic production.” The
  treaty talks will continue on Thursday. • This article was amended on 14
  August 2025. The head of the UK delegation being quoted was the water minister
  Emma Hardy, not Jane Barton as stated in an earlier version.
