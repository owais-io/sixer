  Australia’s economy has wrapped up its weakest financial year since the early
  1990s, outside the pandemic, marking two years of weak growth in the wake of
  the post-Covid lockdown boom. But it’s not all bad news. The latest quarterly
  national accounts show the economy regained some momentum in the three months
  to June, underpinned almost entirely by a welcome recovery in household
  spending. Real GDP lifted by 0.6% in the quarter – and compared to the same
  period last year was 1.8% larger. Australia’s economic performance in recent
  years has been flattered by strong population growth. The Australian Bureau of
  Statistics figures, however, showed real GDP in per capita terms climbed in
  the quarter, if only by a modest 0.2%. Still, that was the second increase in
  per capita growth in the past three quarters, which in turn followed seven
  consecutive quarterly falls. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Jim Chalmers
  acknowledged “some persistent structural issues”, most notably weak
  productivity growth, but said “our economy is in an enviable position”. “If
  you look at last financial year, we achieved what no major advanced economy
  could: we had continuous economic growth, an unemployment (rate) in at least
  the low fours, and we had inflation below 2.5% on the most reliable measure,”
  the treasurer told reporters on Wednesday. “That combination does not exist in
  the major advanced economies, but it exists in our own economy.” Aussies hit
  the shops and cafes A key takeaway from the national accounts was that
  Australians proved more willing to open their wallets. Household consumption
  was the major bright spot, contributing 0.4 percentage points to the 0.6%
  overall economic growth in the June quarter. That was a welcome boost after a
  subdued and weather-affected start to the year. Reserve Bank rate cuts in
  February and May (followed by another in September) are certainly helping, as
  is the fall in the inflation rate to just 2.1% by the middle of the year.
  KPMG’s chief economist, Dr Brendan Rynne, said “households are starting (to)
  feel better about life in general”. “We are close to full levels of employment
  and the combination of stage-three tax cuts coupled with several rate cuts is
  helping Australian households to feel better about spending money,” said
  Rynne, who added he expected two more rate cuts by early 2026. Australians
  took more time off in the Easter and Anzac holidays – which were unusually
  close together – and spent big on travel, eating out and attending events, the
  ABS said. Shoppers also took full advantage of end-of-financial-year sales,
  and continued to buy cars. Household expenditure climbed by 0.9% in the
  quarter and 2% in the year – the fastest pace since the end of 2022. A less
  welcome impetus for higher household consumption was the expiry of government
  energy subsidies. Meanwhile, spending on cigarettes and tobacco plunged by
  8.2% in the quarter, in a further sign that smokers have been turning en masse
  to cheaper, tax-free black market cigarettes. Productivity is still poor While
  experts cheered signs the economy was transitioning away from government
  support, business investment remained a soft spot. The volume of business
  investment (that is, after adjusting for inflation) fell by 0.1% in the June
  quarter and was just 0.1% higher than a year earlier. Mining investment is the
  major drag – down 2.7% in the year, versus a 1% lift in non-mining investment.
  CBA’s head of Australian economics, Belinda Allen, said “the outlook for
  business investment is key to increasing the capital stock and productivity”.
  Chalmers has said that finding a way to spur more business investment was one
  of the priorities for future reform that emerged from the recent roundtable.
  The size of the productivity challenge was again clear in the national
  accounts. Despite a marginal lift in the June quarter, labour productivity has
  stagnated over the past two years following the bursting of the “Covid
  productivity bubble”, and is no higher than it was at the end of 2019. •
