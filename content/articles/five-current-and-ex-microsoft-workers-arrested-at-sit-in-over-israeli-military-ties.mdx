  At least two current and three former Microsoft employees – as well as two
  other tech workers – were arrested at the company’s headquarters after staging
  a sit-in demonstration at the company president’s office urging that Microsoft
  cut ties with the Israeli government. Police placed the protesters in
  full-body harnesses and carried them out of the building, according to Abdo
  Mohamed, a former Microsoft worker and who helped organize the demonstration.
  “No arrests, no violence, will deter us from continuing to speak up,” he said.
  In addition to the protesters who staged a sit-in at Microsoft president Brad
  Smith’s office, other employees, former staff and supporters had gathered
  outside the headquarters. The demonstration on Tuesday was part of a series of
  actions organized by current and former staff over Microsoft’s cloud contracts
  with the Israeli government. Twenty activists were arrested at the company’s
  headquarters in Redmond, Washington last week. The latest protests came after
  joint investigation by the Guardian, Israeli-Palestinian publication +972
  Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, revealed earlier this month
  that Israel’s military surveillance agency, Unit 8200, was making use of
  Microsoft’s Azure software to store countless recordings of mobile phone calls
  made by Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza. The company has said it
  was not aware “of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their
  cellphone conversations using Microsoft’s services”. Microsoft did not
  immediately respond to a query from the Guardian on Tuesday. The company said
  it was launching an independent investigation into the use of its Azure
  software, but activists wanted to escalate actions due to what they viewed as
  inadequate action from the company. “You continue to try to bury your head in
  the sand, so we are here today outside your blood-soaked thrones, to continue
  pulling your baby-killer necks out of your sand holes and continue to force
  you to confront your complicity, until you stop powering the murdering our
  people,” said Ibtihal Aboussad, one of the protesters who delivered a speech
  outside the company headquarters on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Microsoft has been
  taking extraordinary measures to quell demonstrations, which have been ongoing
  for months. According to a report from Bloomberg, the company has requested
  help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to track protests, and worked
  with local authorities to stop them.
