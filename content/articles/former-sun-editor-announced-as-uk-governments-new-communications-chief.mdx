  The former Sun editor David Dinsmore has been announced as the government’s
  new communications chief, despite concerns about his long service at the top
  of Rupert Murdoch’s News UK. Having worked as a tabloid journalist, editor and
  news executive since the 1990s, Dinsmore was appointed to the civil service
  role from a shortlist of two, beating the PR man Tim Allan, formerly an
  adviser to Tony Blair. He will join the civil service as a permanent secretary
  for communications in the Cabinet Office in November, having served as chief
  operating officer of News UK, which is run by Murdoch’s ally Rebekah Brooks.
  His appointment has been met with surprise and some consternation within the
  civil service and by some Labour figures, given the controversies that have
  dogged News UK over the years, from the phone-hacking scandal to its
  Hillsborough coverage, which led to an apology to fans. Although Dinsmore was
  not editor of the Sun at the time of either episode, he has been senior at
  News UK for the last decade while settlements for hacking have been reached.
  Hacked Off, the campaign group, described his appointment as being a
  “dangerous misjudgment and insult to the public”. Three Liverpool MPs – Ian
  Byrne, Kim Johnson and Paula Barker – sent a letter to Starmer on Wednesday
  expressing their concern about Dinsmore’s appointment. Some senior Labour
  women were also uncomfortable with his history of having defended publishing
  pictures of topless women on page 3 to sell newspapers, earning him an award
  for “sexist of the year” in a poll run by the End Violence Against Women
  campaign in 2014, before he finally oversaw the abolition of the practice at
  the end of his tenure. As Sun editor, he was also convicted of publishing a
  pixellated picture of a victim of sexual abuse that still accidentally allowed
  her to be identified, carrying a £1,000 fine. A staunch defender of the UK’s
  news media, Dinsmore told the Society of Editors in 2018 that he was “sick of
  our industry being done down” and once described the Leveson inquiry as having
  left “banana republic-style levels of secrecy” in the British state.
  Journalists who worked with him at News UK said he was a “tough operator”. But
  Giles Kenningham, the founder of the PR firm Trafalgar Strategy and a former
  Conservative communications chief, said Dinsmore was “straightforward,
  charming and likable” with a difficult job ahead of him to take more ownership
  of the government’s own media channels and “turn around the supertanker of the
  machine without letting the bureaucracy take over”. Those with knowledge of
  the decision said he had been picked to drive through change because of
  unhappiness within No 10 at the unwieldiness of government communications, a
  desire to modernise its operation and frustration. The government
  communications service has thousands of staff but some in Downing Street have
  been frustrated by the difficulty of getting it to convey core messages, with
  particular annoyance at “pointless” communications that cost at lot without
  reaching enough people. Despite coming from a traditional print background,
  starting as a reporter for the Sun in 1990 and rising to editor from 2013 to
  2015, Dinsmore oversaw big digital changes at News UK from the launch of Times
  Radio and Talk TV to more video output at the Sun, including its own TV
  programme, Never Mind the Ballots. Government sources said Dinsmore had
  impressed Starmer and No 10 with his ideas on new media and reaching audiences
  more directly. As well as directing overarching communications, he will
  oversee the “new media unit” driven by a Cabinet Office official, Ed
  Bearryman, who has previously worked with Dinsmore as a senior marketing chief
  at News UK. One senior source said Downing Street wanted government
  communications to be “more directional and reactive” and the news executive
  was “politically savvy” and “long in the tooth enough” to provide the
  authority they needed. However, they suggested there could be the potential
  for tensions with the political communications directors James Lyons and Steph
  Driver, as well as other senior Labour operators, unless Dinsmore’s role was
  clearly defined as focused on how the civil service operates. Another former
  Downing Street adviser said they viewed the appointment as a “stop Farage”
  play and in the tradition of many former prime ministers who had appointed
  red-top spinners to senior communications jobs in an effort to tap into more
  populist media. With the threat of Reform continuing to grow, and Nigel Farage
  broadcasting his own clips and talkshows across social media platforms, the
  government has been considering whether it needs to communicate more directly
  with voters. On Thursday, it is due to host dozens of social media influencers
  at a Downing Street reception. Covering areas such as personal finance, health
  and food, all the influencers have worked with Labour either in opposition or
  in government, with the aim of reaching people who consume most of their news
  via social media. “This isn’t instead of our normal communications, it’s an
  expansion,” one official said. “We’re alive to the way people often consume
  media on their own terms according to their particular interests.” While up to
  90 people are expected at the Thursday afternoon event, just four names were
  released in advance: the personal finance influencers Abigail Foster and
  Gabriel Nussbaum, the latter of whom posts under the moniker of That Money
  Guy; Georgia Harrison, who has campaigned about online imagery and so-called
  revenge porn, and Chetna Makan, a chef and writer who appeared on The Great
  British Bake Off. In a statement about his appointment, Dinsmore said it was
  an “honour to be asked to lead this important mission at such a pivotal
  moment”. “Clear and engaging communications are central to public trust,
  policy delivery and national resilience,” he said. “The media landscape is
  evolving at a rapid pace, supercharged by AI, and I look forward to helping
  the government leverage the exciting opportunities in front of us.”
