  Keith Serry was set to bring a show to New York City’s Fringe festival this
  year, but pulled the plug a few weeks out. After 35 years of traveling to the
  United States, he says he no longer feels safe making the trip. “The fact that
  we’re being evaluated for our opinions entering a country that, at least until
  very recently, purported to be an example of democracy. Yeah, these are things
  that make me highly uncomfortable,” said Serry, a Canadian performer and
  attorney. “You’re left thinking that you don’t want to leave evidence of ‘bad
  opinions’ on your person.” Serry is among a substantial cohort of foreign
  nationals reconsidering travel to the US under the Trump administration, after
  troubling reports of visitors facing intense scrutiny and detention on
  arrival. In March, a French scientist who had been critical of Donald Trump
  was refused entry to the US after his phone was searched. An Australian writer
  who was detained and denied entry in June said he was initially grilled about
  his articles on pro-Palestinian protests, and then watched as a border agent
  probed even the most personal images on his phone. He was told the search
  uncovered evidence of past drug use, which he had not acknowledged on his visa
  waiver application, leading to his rejection. German, British and other
  European tourists have also been detained and sent home. More than a dozen
  countries have updated their travel guidance to the US. In Australia and
  Canada, government advisories were changed to specifically mention the
  potential for electronic device searches. On the advice of various experts,
  people are locking down social media, deleting photos and private messages,
  removing facial recognition, or even traveling with “burner” phones to protect
  themselves. In Canada, multiple public institutions have urged employees to
  avoid travel to the US, and at least one reportedly told staff to leave their
  usual devices at home and bring a second device with limited personal
  information instead. “Everybody feels guilty, but they don’t know exactly what
  they’re guilty of,” said Heather Segal, founding partner of Segal Immigration
  Law in Toronto, describing the influx of concerns she’s been hearing. “‘Did I
  do something wrong? Is there something on me? Did I say something that’s going
  to be a problem?’” She advised travelers to assess their risk appetite by
  reviewing both the private data stored on their devices and any information
  about them that’s publicly accessible, and to consider what measures to take
  accordingly. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has broad powers to search
  devices with minimal justification. Travelers can refuse to comply, but
  non-citizens risk being denied entry. CBP data shows such searches are rare;
  last year, just over 47,000 out of 420 million international travelers had
  their devices examined. This year’s figures show a significant increase, with
  the third quarter of 2025 reflecting an uptick in electronic device searches
  higher than any single quarter since 2018, when available data begins.
  “Anecdotally, it seems like these searches have been increasing, and I think
  the reason why that’s true is, undoubtedly, I think they are more targeted
  than before,” said Tom McBrien, counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information
  Center. “It seems like they are targeting people who they just don’t generally
  like politically.” Travelers who are concerned about their privacy should
  consider minimizing the amount of data they carry, McBrien said. “The less
  data you have on you, the less there is to search, and the less there is to
  collect,” he said. Beyond using a secondary device, he suggested securely
  deleting data, moving it to a hard drive or storing it in a password-protected
  cloud account. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson rejected
  claims that CBP had stepped up device searches under the new administration or
  singled out travelers over their political views. “These searches are
  conducted to detect digital contraband, terrorism-related content, and
  information relevant to visitor admissibility, all of which play a critical
  role in national security,” the spokesperson told the Guardian in a statement.
  “Allegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are
  baseless and irresponsible.” The statement acknowledged, however, that there
  had been heightened vetting under Trump and the homeland security secretary,
  Kristi Noem. “Under the leadership of the Trump Administration and Secretary
  Noem, we have the most secure border in American history,” it said. “This has
  allowed CBP to focus to actually vet and interview the people attempting to
  come into our country.” Alistair Kitchen, the Australian writer who was denied
  entry to the US in June, said the DHS’s denial of political targeting directly
  contradicts what he was told on arrival. Border officials “bragged actively
  that the reason for my targeting, for my being pulled out of line for my
  detainment, was explicitly because of what I’d written online about the
  protests at Columbia University”, he told the Guardian. While he doesn’t plan
  to return to the US under the Trump administration, Kitchen said that if he
  ever did, he would either not take a phone or bring a burner. “Under no
  conditions would I ever hand over the passcode to that phone,” he added. “I
  would accept immediate deportation rather than hand over the passcode. People
  should think seriously before booking travel, especially if they are
  journalists or writers or activists.” Various foreign nationals told the
  Guardian they are rethinking travel plans for tourism, family visits, academic
  events and work. Donald Rothwell, a professor who teaches international law at
  the Australian National University, says he no longer plans to accept speaking
  invitations to the US over fears of being detained or denied entry – which, he
  noted, could also trigger red flags on his record for future travel. He’s even
  considered traveling without a device at all, but is concerned his academic
  commentary in the media could be used against him regardless. “I might be
  commenting on matters that could be quite critical of the United States,” he
  said. “For example, I was very critical of the legal or lack of legal
  justification for the US military strikes on Iran in June.” Kate, a Canadian
  whose name has been withheld due to privacy concerns, said she has wrestled
  with complicated decisions about whether to travel across the border to see
  American relatives, including for an upcoming wedding. During a trip earlier
  this year, she deleted her social media apps before going through customs.
  Despite DHS assurances that travelers are not flagged for political beliefs,
  she said “it’s hard to believe things that this government is saying”. “It
  would be really nice to have trust that those kinds of things were true, and
  that these kinds of stories that you hear, while absolutely horrific, are
  isolated incidents,” she said. “But I do feel like in many ways, the United
  States has sort of lost its goodwill.” • This article was amended on 25 August
  2025. An earlier version said CBP data showed there was no significant
  increase in device checks for travelers at the border; however, figures from
  the third quarter of 2025 are the highest recorded since 2018, when available
  data begins.
