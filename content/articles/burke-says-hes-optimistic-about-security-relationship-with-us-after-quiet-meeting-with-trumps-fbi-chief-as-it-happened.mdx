  We’ll leave our live coverage of the day’s news there for this evening. That’s
  the end of the 48th parliament’s first sitting fortnight. Krishani Dhanji will
  be back on the blog when MPs crowd back into Canberra on 25 August. Until
  then, Guardian Australia’s Nick Visser will keep you across each day’s
  breaking news. Here were today’s major updates: Tony Burke says he’s
  “optimistic” about the US-Australia security relationship after a quiet
  meeting with the FBI director Kash Patel. Jim Chalmers said Australian
  recognition of a Palestinian state was “a matter of when, not if” while Penny
  Wong said the government is “of course” considering moving to recognise a
  Palestinian state in September in line with Canada, the United Kingdom and
  France. Wong also admitted it was not possible to track if goods from
  sanctioned nations might be imported via a third country, after reports an oil
  tanker docked in Western Australia could be carrying Russian fuel processed in
  India. Labor has scheduled debate on Barnaby Joyce’s bill to drop net zero
  targets for when parliament returns next month, pressuring the opposition on
  net zero. The Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, backed Labor’s childcare bill but
  warned the “next part is very difficult” ahead of a federal, state and
  territory ministers’ meeting next month to reform the working with children
  checks system and discuss rules around CCTV footage. And Elon Musk’s X has
  lost a court case where it tried to claim that a notice issued to Twitter over
  its tackling of child sexual abuse material did not account for the company
  “ceasing to exist” when X Corp merged with Twitter in March 2023. Thanks for
  staying with us. See you tomorrow. Public Service Commissioner says he has
  been cleared over robodebt inquiry The Australian Public Service commissioner
  says he has been cleared of any wrongdoing over his role in the robodebt code
  of conduct inquiry after two complaints were made against him following the
  agency’s release of its report into the 12 public servants who it found had
  breached the code of conduct 97 times during their involvement in the debt
  recovery program. The commissioner, Gordon de Brouwer, said the merit
  protection commissioner had finalised its inquiries into the 10 allegations
  made against him, including that he failed to act impartially, released
  inaccurate and damaging information and improperly disclosed information. De
  Brouwer said the statement, released on Thursday afternoon, was necessary
  after a member of the public obtained relevant documents through a freedom of
  information request. He said: Given that I am reasonably identifiable in the
  documents, it is in the public interest to address any speculation on this
  matter and to maintain the reputation of the office of Australian Public
  Service Commissioner. The APSC’s report, released last September, found 12
  public servants, including former department heads Kathryn Campbell and Renée
  Leon, breached the code of conduct 97 times. As a result, the two former
  agency heads now have to declare the findings, if asked, for the next five
  years if they try to get work in the Australian public service or as a
  contractor. The other 10 public servants, including four that were still
  employed by the Australian public service at the time, were not named. The
  four still employed at the time faced a range of sanctions from demotion to
  reprimands and fines if they remained employed. Ten unions support
  pro-Palestine protest involving march across Sydney Harbour Bridge Ten unions
  are among the more than 60 organisations who have sent an open letter to the
  NSW premier urging him to facilitate a protest that would involve marching
  across the Sydney Harbour Bridge this Sunday. The letter, addressed to Chris
  Minns, said: The Sydney Harbour Bridge has a rich history of democratic
  community action, including the 2000 Walk for Reconciliation and the 2023
  World Pride march. Seeking to shut down this rally would be a serious
  departure from the NSW State and Police’s responsibility to uphold the
  democratic right of protest. The NSW branches of the unions which have signed
  on to the letter include: Nurses and Midwives Association Teachers Federation
  Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Public Service Association United
  Workers Union Australian Services Union Electrical Trades Union Independent
  Education Union National Tertiary Education Union Maritime Union of Australia,
  Sydney branch Minns said on Tuesday he was not questioning the motives of the
  protesters, just the route, saying he would not close the bridge “for any
  circumstances”. He acknowledged there was widespread community concern about
  the war in Gaza. Labor and Liberal MPs not keen to comment on Burke’s FBI
  meeting Tony Burke’s unannounced meeting with the Trump-appointed FBI
  director, Kash Patel, has drawn the ire of the Greens, but MPs in the two
  major parties aren’t so keen to comment. Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie and Labor’s
  Jerome Laxale were on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, discussing reforms to the
  early childhood education sector and new Australian federal police allegations
  against an after-school carer. Conversation then turned to Burke’s quiet
  dinner with Patel while the FBI chief was in the region to open a new office
  in New Zealand. McKenzie said she had no comment on the meeting as she had
  been busy with her legislative work. To be fair I have been so focused on
  early childhood this week and indeed the education legislation going through
  the chamber that I have nothing to add on that, I’ll leave the Labor party to
  [that]. Laxale also demurred: I’m sorry, I will have to let this one go
  through the keeper as well. I’ve been dealing with the breaking news of the
  AFP all afternoon, so I’m not aware of this reporting or these plans, you may
  have to ask your next guest. Tony Burke says he’s “optimistic” about what the
  US and Australia “can achieve together in the interest of national security”
  after a quiet meeting with the Federal Bureau of Investigations director. The
  home affairs minister had dinner with the FBI chief, Kash Patel, who was in
  the region to open the bureau’s first ever office in New Zealand on Thursday.
  In a statement, Burke said: We share a commitment to keeping our people safe,
  and I’m optimistic about what we can achieve together in the interest of
  national security. The new FBI office in New Zealand was set up to counter
  China’s activities in the Indo-Pacific, and crack down on cybercrime. Burke
  did not say whether Australia was considering allowing the FBI to open a
  similar office in the country. Patel is a Donald Trump ally, who has made
  headlines in recent weeks amid the Jeffrey Epstein controversy and previously
  praised the QAnon conspiracy-theory movement. Shadow minister for Indigenous
  Australians offers full support for Labor to turn around worsening outcomes
  The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians has offered Labor support to
  turn around worsening outcomes for First Nations communities as new data shows
  just four of 19 Closing the Gap targets are on track. Youth and adult
  imprisonment rates, children in out-of-home care, suicide and childhood
  development are among the outcomes continuing to deteriorate. Kerrynne Liddle,
  also the Coalition’s spokesperson for social services, said she wanted to help
  the government turn things around. She said: The minister talks about
  bipartisanship and she has my full support as I am sure she does many people,
  to actually focus and make progress in these issues. I’ve been calling from
  the beginning for more accountability on how the funding has been spent and
  what progress it is making in terms of outcomes … It’s also about bureaucrats
  doing more about those programs, that they manage to make sure that they are
  being delivered in the way it was intended. Liddle also endorsed the Northern
  Territory government’s move to reintroduce the use of spit hoods in youth
  detention centres. I wouldn’t appreciate being spat at. I’m sure nobody would
  appreciate that in the workplace. But [what] we need to do is work with these
  children earlier … so that they don’t feel the need to just spit at people.
  The FBI chief, Kash Patel, has met with the minister for home affairs, Tony
  Burke, Penny Wong has confirmed, drawing criticism from the Greens. The
  director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation today opened the bureau’s
  first-ever office in New Zealand in what he said was an attempt to help
  counter China’s activities in the Indo-Pacific, crack down on issues including
  cybercrime and strengthen protection of the Five Eyes nations. Wong declined
  to say whether she supported the FBI expansion but confirmed Patel met Burke,
  speaking to the ABC. Patel is a Donald Trump ally who has made headlines in
  recent weeks over the Jeffrey Epstein controversy and previously praised the
  QAnon conspiracy-theory movement. Greens senator David Shoebridge criticised
  what he described as “secret meetings,” demanding Burke share what he
  discussed with Patel. He told the ABC: Meetings that nobody knew about with a
  highly controversial Trump appointee … That’s not a good look for any
  government … I can understand why Minister Burke wanted nobody to know about
  it but they have an obligation to be honest with the Australian public, and
  not to be meeting behind closed doors without telling the public. Penny Wong
  has said the government is “of course” considering moving to recognise a
  Palestinian state in September in line with Canada, the United Kingdom and
  France. The foreign minister said the Albanese government welcomed Canada’s
  announcement it planned on a conditional recognition of a state of Palestine
  in which Hamas had no part when the United Nations’ general assembly meets.
  Asked whether Australia remained open to a similar declaration in September,
  Wong said: Of course these are discussions which are ongoing … This is
  something that we are thinking very carefully about, just as we think
  carefully about what can we do to contribute to bring about the ceasefire in
  Gaza. We know we are not a central player but what we can do is what we have
  done which is call for cease-fire, join with others. Wong would not be drawn
  on whether Labor was committed to matching leading allies, reiterating the
  government’s focus on securing peace through a two-state solution. She told
  the ABC: We welcome the momentum towards the pathway to peace and that is what
  two states is about. … I hope what happens in New York in September is we see
  the hostages released, we see the commitments from the Palestinian Authority
  and others in the region about the security of Israel, the demilitarisation of
  the Palestinian state and a move towards recognition … That’s what we want.
  Retail sales grow by fastest in more than two years Households have picked up
  their retail spending by the most since 2023, easing concerns that sales to
  consumers were collapsing. The final release of retail sales data shows
  household spending picked up 1.2% from May to June, taking the annual lift to
  4.9%. Household goods retail sales rose a strong 2.3% over the month, helped
  by furniture and a big swing in electrical goods, which Robert Ewing, the ABS
  head of business statistics, attributed to the Nintendo Switch 2: After steady
  growth throughout the year, mid-year sales events increased spending on
  discretionary items like furniture, electrical goods and clothing items
  Turnover for electrical and gaming retailers was lifted further by the
  much-anticipated launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which delivered record
  sales. Analysts at UBS said the uptick was enough to allay concerns spending
  could slide, writing in a note: We could now be seeing a shift in consumer
  spending momentum under way, after having earlier disappointed. Tailwinds of
  rising household disposable income from tax and interest rate cuts and still
  low unemployment should support [spending]. The ABS looked back at the
  statistics series in farewell before it’s replaced with new spending data, and
  noticed a major change in household’s spending. Food once was the single
  biggest share of household final consumption expenditure – at one-sixth in
  1964 – but fell to less than a tenth of spending by 2024. Housing costs are
  now the biggest expense, up from about a tenth in 1964 to a quarter in 2024.
  Thanks so much to Krishani Dhanji for guiding us through the first sitting
  fortnight of the 48th parliament! I’ll be with you for the rest of the day’s
  news. That’s it from me today, thank you so much for joining me on the blog
  this sitting fortnight. I’ll leave you with the wonderful Luca Ittimani for
  the rest of the afternoon. Despite the vague lack of energy in the chamber,
  there were a lot of energy questions today for Chris Bowen about whether
  energy prices have been increasing or decreasing. The government’s dixers were
  predictable – Hecs, penalty rates, healthcare and energy – but Jason Clare did
  provide an update on protecting children in childcare, which was supported by
  the opposition leader, Sussan Ley. Liberal MP Ben Small got kicked out. Helen
  Haines asked what the government will do for the tens of thousands of people
  waiting for a home care package before the government brings more online (the
  packages were supposed to be rolled out from July 1). The government didn’t
  provide any specific measures. Look, we’re at the end of the sitting
  fortnight, and some people (including Jim Chalmers) could not have walked out
  of the chamber faster as soon as QT was over. Delving back into question time
  briefly, there was a moment of unity in the chamber over the government’s
  childcare bill. During a dixer, the education minister, Jason Clare, addressed
  the latest allegations relating to a childcare worker in New South Wales. This
  is the start, not the end. To be brutally honest, this work will never end.
  And the sickening (alleged) news we heard from the Australian Federal Police
  in the last few hours is a reminder of why this is so important. There is a
  lot of work we need to do together to rebuild trust and confidence in the
  system that parents need to have confidence in. Jason Clare and the attorney
  general, Michelle Rowland, will meet with their state and territory
  counterparts next month to reform the working with children checks system and
  discuss rules around CCTV footage. Sussan Ley stood up afterward and said the
  government had done good work but that the “next part is very difficult”.
  Sitting down with the states and territories, as we have all done in
  ministerial positions in the past, can descend into a talkfest and ministers
  depart to their state and nothing happens. We cannot afford to have that this
  time. There have been so many points of order today, the opposition have even
  made a point of order on a dixer. The PM tried to have a bit of a go at the
  “split” opposition when he was watching Sky News this week: There was a
  national leader in the studio with Laura Jayes but in the corner in the little
  box there was … the renegades out the front along with one or two Liberals in
  the corner. A split screen showing a split party. He’s talking about the press
  conference that Barnaby Joyce and a group of other Coalition members made
  raging about net zero. Alex Hawke gets up, to no avail, and Anthony Albanese
  says he misses the former manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher. Every
  time the new manager of opposition business gets up you feel a little
  nostalgic for Paul Fletcher. Joni Mitchell was right, you don’t know what
  you’ve got until it’s gone. Put me in a big yellow taxi and get me outta here
  … with that, QT is over for another day. Opposition continue attacks over
  quarterly power price rise Bowen is back, with another question from the
  opposition on whether today’s data by the Australian Energy Regulator shows
  energy prices are going up or down. Despite all the numbers – which we don’t
  always get in question time – we don’t seem to be getting particularly far on
  the issue today. Bowen says prices have risen in the last quarter, but as per
  his previous answer, prices have gone down since Labor first came into
  government. Quarterly price rises, wholesale prices rose. That is what the
  report said, thanks for noticing. Bowen says that the reason wholesale prices
  have dropped over the last three and a bit years is because of all the new
  renewable energy that the government has helped bring online. Earlier in
  Senate question time, the independent senator Fatima Payman asked Penny Wong
  about reports of an oil tanker docked in Western Australia believed to be
  carrying Russian fuel processed in India. While Australia has joined other
  nations in banning the import of Russian oil in response to its invasion in
  Ukraine, it’s possible Russian oil is still being sold in Australia after it
  has been refined in a third country. Payman asked Wong whether the Albanese
  government had assurances Russian oil was not being sold in the country, given
  the sanctions imposed on them. Wong responded: I’ve said publicly,
  regrettably, the mechanisms we would need to track and monitor all energy
  products via third countries, are not in place in those countries, and
  obviously, we’ll continue to look at what options we can utilise to place
  further pressure on Russia’s oil revenues ... Australians do expect businesses
  to try and avoid their supply chains from inadvertently funding Russia’s
  illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Certainly, the government does call
  on businesses to uphold that responsibility. But the answer to the question,
  Senator, is … we have sanctioned. We’ve increased those sanctions, including
  on the shadow fleet. But secondly, regrettably, there are not the mechanisms
  in third countries to enable all of the issues you raised to be tracked.
  Albanese agrees with Katter than Glencore ‘should back the town that backed
  them’ after factory closures We’re back to the crossbench, and Bob Katter asks
  the prime minister about the closure of the Mount Isa underground copper
  operation, owned by Swiss multinational Glencore. He also asks whether the
  government will initiate an east coast gas reservation policy to protect
  industry, including the Mount Isa fertiliser plant. Anthony Albanese
  acknowledges the workers who are losing their jobs with the closure – around
  500 – and says Katter is right to call the closure out. Australia has been
  good to Glencore and they need to be good back to Australia. They should back
  the town that has backed them and has helped build the wealth of their
  shareholders … I assure the member I will continue to work constructively with
  him, as I always have, and that the industry minister is very engaged in this
  issue along with a whole of government response. Katter’s son, the Queensland
  state MP Robbie Katter, is also in the House today in the public gallery.
  Chalmers on superannuation: it’s possible to disagree with Paul Keating The
  shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, is up now, and asks Jim Chalmers about the
  superannuation tax. He quotes Paul Keating, who’s told the media the tax is
  “unconscionable” and asks Chalmers whether Keating, his political idol, is
  wrong. “No disrespect to Paul,” Chalmers says, but sometimes they don’t agree
  on policy. It is a matter of public record that I value my relationship with
  Paul Keating, someone I have known for a long time and somebody who I continue
  to admire. It is possible to admire Paul Keating and respect him and to
  occasionally have a different view to Paul Keating and this is what has
  happened on this occasion and I have said that publicly on a number of
  occasions, no disrespect to Paul when I say it. He ends saying “I won’t be
  taking lectures on superannuation from those opposite” and accuses the
  Coalition of “hating” super. Aged care minister says additional 80,000 home
  care packages to be rolled out from November The next crossbench question goes
  to Helen Haines, who asks the government what they’re doing to help families
  who are waiting for home care packages that have been delayed. She says the
  government ignored calls to bridge the gap by immediately funding 20,000 home
  care packages. There are currently 87,000 people on the home care wait list.
  Sam Rae, the new aged care minister, says he acknowledges that the Australian
  population is ageing and demand for home care packages are growing. After an
  interjection from Haines, asking what the government will do before the
  promised packages come online, Rae still won’t detail exactly how the
  government will look after those still waiting. From 1 November, [the
  government] will roll out an additional 80,000 packages in the first 12
  months. Until then, over the course of the period between now and November my
  number one priority is ensuring that older people continue [to] receive the
  care and services that they need, and until November we continue to assign the
  packages each and every week in accordance with the national priority system.
  Bowen defends answer as power prices pursuit continues Bowen is back… again.
  Another new MP, Liberal Leon Rebello, asks Bowen about a report released today
  that says wholesale energy prices have risen in Queensland in the last quarter
  by 25% and risen in Victoria in the last quarter by 21%. So did Bowen ignore
  those figures in Bowen’s previous answer? Bowen says that the question he
  received was the difference in price between now and when the government was
  elected – not the last quarter. “I apologise for using the frame that was put
  to me,” Bowen says. The CSIRO has found that renewables, including cost
  associated with additional storage and transmission remain the lowest-cost,
  lowest built-cost technology. Again, I should have issued a trigger warning
  that I was going to mention the CSIRO and science. Just a bit of a dig at the
  end there ... Liberal MP ejected for an hour as Bowen continues to field
  questions over power bills Well we’ve established a clear pattern in the
  opposition’s questions today. David Batt, a new LNP MP, asks Chris Bowen why
  Christine, a resident in his electorate, has been “forced to return to work”
  as electricity bills and rents increase. But before Bowen gets into his
  answer, we have our first eviction of QT today! It’s new WA Liberal MP (and
  former senator) Ben Small, who’s ejected for one hour. Remember: the new House
  rules mean a member can be ejected for either one hour or up to three hours.
  Anyway, back to Bowen’s answer, he says the government is working to help
  bring Christine’s energy bills down. He says renewable energy is the cheapest
  form of energy, which he accuses the opposition of being “prejudiced against”.
  Staying on energy, the shadow minister, Dan Tehan, asks Chris Bowen if the
  government will hit its target of 82% renewables by 2030. Bowen stands up and
  almost makes the commitment but then says … I can absolutely confirm … that it
  is this government’s intention to continue to work towards that target. That
  gets a quick groan from the opposition. We all know intention doesn’t
  necessarily mean it will happen – but Bowen adds that the government is making
  “good progress”, including having brought 4.4 gigawatts of energy online in
  the last financial year. Dan Tehan makes a point of relevance and asks for
  some reverence (insert chuckles here) and says that his question wasn’t about
  intention. The speaker, Milton Dick, says this is a “bad path” and let’s just
  not get into semantics. Bowen continues, saying that the government at least
  has a target that while those opposite don’t. He also mentions the “bromance”
  between Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack – the two Nationals senators
  leading the charge for dumping net zero within the party. Keogh says veteran
  and family hubs are being established as promised The first question from the
  crossbench comes from former Nationals MP turned independent Andrew Gee, who
  says parts of his community want to set up wellbeing hubs for veterans and
  their families. He asks the minister if he’ll come and visit Bathurst and
  Orange who want to establish them. Matt Keogh says he’d be happy to visit the
  two towns in Gee’s electorate, and that the hubs are being established as
  promised at the 2022 election. We went to the 2022 election, we made a
  commitment to rolling out 10 veterans and families hubs across the country, we
  made sure that we selected locations based on the highest concentrations of
  veterans and families around the country … [they are] the priority area[s] to
  focus on rolling out those hubs and it means that we are now in the process of
  having opened and are rolling out some 17 veterans’ and families hubs. Ley
  continues targeting power bills in question time Sussan Ley steps up again for
  the second question, this time to Chris Bowen, asking what the average monthly
  household power bill is today compared with when Labor took office three years
  ago. Bowen is speeding through some numbers, The Queensland bill is $139 and
  the average [bill on] election day was $347.28. In South Australia the average
  today is $125 and average on election day was $312.30. But before he gets too
  far, Ley stands up and says despite the “rapid-fire delivery”, he’s actually
  giving wholesale power prices rather than answering her question. The speaker,
  Milton Dick, says the point of order isn’t an opportunity to add new stuff to
  the question. Bowen starts again with some new numbers – which honestly can
  barely be heard because everyone is shouting in the chamber. After everyone
  settles (because Dick tells them to), Bowen continues: We on this side of the
  house agree that Australians have looked and will continue to look to the
  government to do more to assist on household energy bills. The work is far
  from done, we delivered three rounds of energy bill relief but we recognise
  that around the world, including in Australia, our prices hit higher than
  anyone would like. But that is why we have taken such action. Sussan Ley
  starts question time on the cost of energy. She asks why 63,000 more
  Australian families are on hardship assistance arrangements for their power
  bills today than on the day Labor took office three years ago. Anthony
  Albanese says the government has provided three lots of energy bill relief for
  households, and talks about the government’s intervention to cap prices in the
  gas market. He then tries to bring up a question from yesterday’s question
  time from Liberal MP Mary Aldred. Ley stands up on a point of order and says
  the PM isn’t saying why families are struggling. The speaker, Milton Dick,
  doesn’t take Ley’s side on this one, and Albanese finishes his answer talking
  about the home battery scheme (which also got a lot of mentions in QT
  yesterday by Chris Bowen) and arguing that the opposition’s solution was to
  propose building nuclear power plants. A disgraced state MP who sexually
  abused two young men has suffered yet another court defeat, AAP reports. Kiama
  MP Gareth Ward, 44, was convicted earlier in July in the NSW district court of
  sexual intercourse without consent and three indecent assaults. A day after
  being denied bail while he waits to be sentenced, his defamation lawsuit
  against radio station 2SM was heard in the district court. The nature of the
  defamation allegations was not revealed in a brief court hearing on Thursday –
  except that it related to his recent criminal convictions. Ward’s lawyer asked
  that the defamation case be adjourned until after his sentence hearing on 19
  September and while he considers appeal avenues. But Judge Judith Gibson
  knocked back that suggestion and removed the case from the court’s inactive
  list, instead setting the matter down for a directions hearing on 11
  September. The judge noted that Ward’s conviction would be “important” in the
  proceedings, but added it was unlikely his sentence would be finalised on 19
  September. “I don’t think that standing it over for close to a month is going
  to achieve anything much,” Gibson told the court. Lawyers for 2SM indicated
  they wanted the defamation matter dealt with as soon as possible. In February
  2013, Ward invited a drunk 18-year-old man, whom he met a year before, to his
  South Coast home. The man told the jury at trial Ward plied him with drinks
  before indecently assaulting him three times in one night, despite his
  attempts to resist. The long-time MP also sexually assaulted an intoxicated
  political staffer after a mid-week event at NSW Parliament House in 2015. The
  man, who was 24 at the time but is now in his 30s, said Ward climbed into bed
  with him, groped his backside and sexually assaulted him despite him
  repeatedly saying “no”. The Nationals to ‘settle’ on net zero position ‘in
  coming months’ The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, says his party will
  come to a settled position on net zero “in the next couple of months”, and
  strongly backed the ability of his members to bring forth private members’
  bills on topics like this. Of course this comes in the context of Barnaby
  Joyce putting up a bill to scrap the net zero target. Littleproud, asked about
  his party’s efforts in the first fortnight of parliament, said it was healthy
  for democracy for bills to be debated. “This place is about democracy … I
  think it’s a great thing that we have members of parliament, in the Senate and
  in the House of Reps, who come and bring forward private members’ bills that
  are important to their districts or important to this country,” Littleproud
  told a press conference. We should never try and subvert that process.
  Littleproud said the Nationals wouldn’t be “kicking it down the road too
  long”, adding that their answer on net zero would come in coming months. I’m
  pretty comfortable with that process, but we’ll be sure to nail our position.
  There is some drama going down in the house at the moment! Labor is moving to
  maximise pressure on the opposition on net zero by scheduling debate on
  Barnaby Joyce’s private member’s bill, for when parliament returns next month.
  It’s a tactical play, and has split Joyce and his colleague Michael McCormack,
  who is voting with the rest of the Coalition, against allowing debate on it.
  Joyce voted with the government to debate his own bill. Boarding call for
  furry friends In news outside politics, Virgin Airlines says it should be
  ready to allow our furry friends on domestic flights by the end of 2025. Last
  week, the food ministers’ meeting (today I also learned there’s a dedicated
  meeting for federal, state and territory food ministers) allowed small cats
  and dogs to be permitted on flights in controlled conditions. Virgin’s CEO,
  David Emerson, reportedly a summit in Cairns today that it’s been a “longer
  process than we thought” to get pets on board, but it will soon finally
  happen: We’re looking forward to launching before the end of the year. The
  opposition tried to move amendments noting that the government “failed to
  consult meaningfully with Australian small businesses” on the impact of the
  bill, and that the government should provide a regulatory impact statement
  immediately. The crossbench was split on the Coalition’s amendments – Allegra
  Spender, Monique Ryan and Kate Chaney voted with the Coalition, while
  Nicolette Boele, Sophie Scamps, Rebekah Sharkie, Helen Haines, Dai Le and Zali
  Steggall voted with the government to reject the amendment. The government put
  forward an amendments to its own bill – that has now passed, and will be sent
  over to the Senate. In another episode of politicians doing politics, during
  the debate, employment minister, Amanda Rishworth, tried testing her shadow
  counterpart Tim Wilson to say that the opposition doesn’t support penalty
  rates. Wilson countered saying the Coalition does support penalty rates, and
  was trying to get the government to say how many small businesses will be
  impacted by this legislation. Coalition’s efforts to investigate decision to
  allow US beef imports shot down Labor and the Greens have shot down the
  Coalition’s attempt to investigate the decision to allow more beef imports
  from the US. The Coalition has been calling for an independent review into the
  decision, and senator Matt Canavan put forward the motion to have the
  processes and advice provided by the department looked at by a committee. The
  decision to lift restrictions came after the Trump administration had publicly
  criticised the import blocks, but the government said Australia’s biosecurity
  won’t be weakened, and the decision was separate from discussions on trade
  tariffs. ABC ‘deeply concerned’ about health and safety of freelance
  journalists in Gaza The ABC is calling on Israel to allow international
  journalists to report independently from Gaza and is “deeply concerned” about
  the health and safety of freelance journalists it works with on the ground.
  ABC news director, Justin Stevens, wrote in a statement that the ABC is the
  “only Australian media organisation with a permanent presence in the region
  and we have repeatedly tried to get reporters back into Gaza”. The ABC relies
  on a “network of freelanced journalists and individuals on the ground”, and
  Stevens said the organisation is “seeing the effects of food shortages on
  journalists we work with”. We rely on a network of freelance journalists and
  individuals on the ground to tell the story of what they are witnessing. We
  are deeply concerned about their health and safety. According to the Committee
  to Protect Journalists, at least 186 journalists and media workers, mostly
  Palestinian, have been killed while gathering evidence of the war inside Gaza
  since 7 October. That number includes journalists who have done work for the
  ABC. We’re now seeing the effects of food shortages on journalists we work
  with. ABC Middle East correspondent, Matthew Doran, wrote about the
  deteriorating situation for journalists last week, describing one colleague he
  has worked with in Gaza who has lost 34kg and said he “does not have the
  strength to hold a camera any more”. As cost-of-living pressures continue to
  hit households around the country, the Greens say they will push a bill to
  make price-gouging illegal in the new parliament. The Greens treasury
  spokesperson, Nick McKim, plans to reintroduce legislation on Thursday. It is
  aimed at increasing pressure on Labor and follows a similar promise from the
  Albanese government during the election campaign. McKim said: Coles and
  Woolworths are using their enormous market power to squeeze every last dollar
  they can from people just trying to feed their families. The Greens’ bill
  would give the competition watchdog the power to investigate and prosecute
  corporations that exploit their market power to hike prices unfairly. We
  welcomed Labor’s election promise to ban supermarket price gouging, but since
  the election we’ve seen no action. Labor needs to honour their promise and
  take action against the profiteering supermarket corporations.” Education
  department ‘ready to act swiftly’ against childcare centres not meeting
  standards Going back briefly to Jason Clare’s press conference earlier, the
  education minister said his department will “act swiftly” against
  underperforming childcare centres when the new legislation passes parliament.
  The bill to crackdown on childcare providers with poor safety standards could
  pass the parliament today. Clare told us earlier this week that, once the bill
  passes, the department will start looking at taking action against those not
  meeting standards. He wouldn’t say which centres were on his priority list for
  taking action, but flagged he’d soon have more to say. He said today: The
  intention here is not for centres to close but for centres to raise their
  standards to meet the quality and safety standards that we expect them to
  have. But it’s not an idle threat … I think parents will want to know if their
  centres are not up to scratch. And that’s why, as part of this legislation,
  we’re saying that, if my department imposes a condition on a centre and says,
  “You’ve got this time to get up to scratch,” they have to tell the parents at
  that centre what’s happening as well so they’ve got the information they need
  to make the decisions they need to make, to make sure their children are
  getting the best-quality care and education they can. Clare said he wouldn’t
  go into the priority list today, but that he’d told the department “to be
  ready to act swiftly.” “I’ll have more to say next week,” the minister said.
  Ninety six homeless Queenslanders banned from emergency accommodation under
  crackdown Ninety six homeless Queenslanders have been banned from emergency
  accommodation for six months within the first two months of a new crackdown.
  Mark Cridland, director general for Queensland’s Department of Housing and
  Public, revealed just under 4,000 people were currently living in a hotel or
  motel paid for by the department under its ‘immediate housing response’
  scheme. Of the 96 people evicted under a new policy implemented in May, 59%
  had been evicted as a result of bad behaviour or a breach of hotel rules, he
  said. He added no people had yet been banned from both social housing and
  emergency accommodation, under the government’s new three-strike policy. Four
  “first and final notices were issued for dangerous and severe behaviors” have
  been issued since the policy came into effect in July, according to housing
  and public works minister, Sam O’Connor. How office buildings, factories and
  shopping centres can cause legionnaires’ outbreaks Following from the news of
  a legionnaires’ disease outbreak that has seen one man die and six others
  hospitalised, Guardian Australia’s Matilda Boseley is here to explain what the
  infection is and how legionella bacteria spreads: Elon Musk’s X has lost a
  full federal court appeal where the company tried to claim that a notice
  issued to Twitter over its tackling of child sexual abuse material did not
  account for the company “ceasing to exist” when X Corp merged with Twitter in
  March 2023. X had challenged whether the notice could have been issued in the
  first place because it was first brought against Twitter prior to the company
  becoming X. The full federal court dismissed the appeal, with costs, with the
  judgment noting that between the notice being issued to Twitter and X being
  fined, eSafety continued to engage with representatives of the company, and it
  wasn’t clear what issuing a fresh notice to X would have changed. The judgment
  stated the challenge “has no substantive merit” X and eSafety were approached
  for comment. X has several concurrent court cases running against eSafety. The
  X loss today means, barring a high court appeal, the case eSafety brought in
  the federal court seeking an fine of up to $610,500 can now proceed. • A
  previous version of this post stated that the merits of the notice were to be
  decided in a separate administrative review tribunal case. This was incorrect,
  as that case is related to a separate notice also related to the company’s
  handling of terror content on its platform. A man in his 80s has died as
  health authorities investigate an outbreak of legionnaires’ disease in a
  harbourside Sydney suburb. Another six Potts Point residents have been
  hospitalised with the infection since late May, one of whom is yet to return
  home. None of the patients are known to each other, though they may have
  become infected after exposure to a common source, according to South Eastern
  Sydney Local Health District (SESLHD). Water sources in the areas visited by
  the seven locals are being tested for potential contamination as health
  authorities and the City of Sydney seek to determine the source of the
  outbreak. Investigation are yet to find legionella bacteria but authorities
  have asked building owners to disinfect their cooling towers on two occasions
  since the investigation began in June, SESHLD’s public health unit director,
  Dr Vicky Sheppeard, said. She added: People who have recently been in Potts
  Point and develop these symptoms should see their GP or go to a hospital
  emergency department. Outbreaks can occur after contamination of bacteria from
  cooling towers on large buildings or other environmental sources, Sheppeard
  said. Legionnaires’ disease is not normally spread from person to person. The
  disease is a form of pneumonia, or lung infection, caused by legionella
  bacteria. The bacteria can be found in damp environments and, in Australia,
  the two most common types are found in water and soil. You can read more about
  the disease here: Education ministers to meet in August to discuss ‘key
  questions’ relating to childcare centre CCTV The issue of CCTV will be
  discussed at the next meeting of state, territory and federal education
  ministers. Clare says there are key questions on how that data will be used or
  stored, which will be addressed at that meeting in August. The last thing you
  want to do here is create a honey pot for bad people. So where does the [CCTV]
  data get stored? How does it get used? I’m on the record saying that I think
  it has real value in potentially deterring bad people from doing bad things. I
  think it also has real value for police in being able to use that in their
  investigations. That’s after – after the fact, though. If it can deter, that’s
  good. Asked about the Hecs legislation, and the push from the Greens to go
  further to wipe Hecs debt completely, Clare says it’s not just a one-off cut,
  and the reforms change the structure of how the debt is paid back for all
  students. The legislation increases the salary threshold for those paying
  student debts back, meaning graduates on lower salaries won’t have to begin
  paying their debt back until later, or will pay back less until they earn
  more. Instead of paying back around about $1,900 once they hit $70,000, it’s
  about $450 … When you’re on $70,000 and might be renting, that money matters,
  that money counts. That helps you to pay for rent, pay for food, pay for
  public transport. This was a recommendation of the Accord. It was a
  recommendation of a bloke named Bruce Chapman who for those who don’t know was
  the architect of Hecs back in the ‘80s. And he says that this is perhaps the
  most important change to the Hecs system in 35 years. ‘There is a mountain of
  work to do’ to fix childcare: Clare Clare says again that this legislation is
  only the start of reforms that governments – federal, state and territory –
  need to do to fix the system. The impact of the legislation, Clare says,
  should be to raise the standards of centres, not to force them shut, at a time
  when the government is also trying to boost the number of children accessing
  early childhood education. Clare says there’s already a list of providers
  prepared, that the government could take action against – but he won’t yet
  reveal who’s on it. I won’t expand on that today. I will have more to say on
  that when the department publishes that list. First, the bill needs to pass
  the parliament, then it needs to receive royal assent. But I have directed my
  department to be ready to act swiftly. I’ll have more to say next week. Hecs
  cut ‘promised and delivered’ says education minister The education minister,
  Jason Clare, is speaking to the media, after the passing of the government’s
  Hecs bill through the Senate. We promised it and we’ve delivered. Young
  Australians don’t always see something for them on the ballot paper, but they
  did this year. Clare says the debt relief will be backdated to 1 June this
  year, before indexation was applied. He also says he’s hopeful the childcare
  legislation will be passed in the Senate before question time today. Here’s a
  video of Lidia Thorpe moving the motion earlier this morning: Thorpe urges PM
  to use Garma festival speech to commit to deaths in custody royal commission
  recommendations Independent senator Lidia Thorpe has called on Anthony
  Albanese to use his speech at the Garma festival to implement the
  recommendations of the deaths in custody royal commission. Albanese will
  travel to the Northern Territory this weekend for the important Indigenous
  cultural and community festival. He will make a speech at the event, which is
  often where federal leaders commit to new policy and stances in Indigenous
  affairs. Speaking after her motion on deaths in custody was passed by the
  Senate, Thorpe told a press conference that she hoped Albanese would use Garma
  to commit to taking more federal action on hanging points and other concerns
  in prisons. No one’s had oversight of those recommendations for two decades,
  since the demise of Atsic. They’ve been sitting there for two decades. No one
  gave a damn that deaths in custody was still happening, so oversight and
  action on implementing the remainder of those recommendations, removing
  hanging points would be great. We know that there’s been hanging points that
  have been used 20 times. The prisons know. The cops know. The governments
  know, yet they allow people to continue to take their lives in known hanging
  points. A recommendation from the royal commission is to remove them, to
  provide mental health services, to allow communities to self determine their
  own solutions. So it’d be great if the prime minister took it seriously and
  not just rock up [to Garma] to see culture on display. The government’s Hecs
  debt bill has passed parliament, a key promise of the federal election. The
  Greens tried to move several amendments to the bill, but the government
  wouldn’t support them. Ultimately the bill passed without amendments – it’s
  the first bill to pass in the new term – supported by Labor, the Greens,
  independents including David Pocock, Tammy Tyrrell and Fatima Payman.
  Coalition senators abstained from voting, and three One Nation senators voted
  against the bill. Lidia Thorpe introducing her motion into the Senate this
  morning Thorpe’s motion expressed sympathies to the families of the 17 First
  Nations people who have died in custody this year, including 24-year-old
  Walpiri man Kumanjayi White, and to the families of the 602 Indigenous deaths
  in custody since the release of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal
  deaths in custody. The motion was supported by Labor and the Greens. RBA
  deputy governor says consumer price figures ‘very welcome’ The Reserve Bank’s
  deputy governor, Andrew Hauser, says yesterday’s consumer price figures were
  “very welcome”, in a further signal that the central bank has gained some
  comfort with the trajectory of inflation and that it will cut rates next
  month. Inflation dropped to 2.1% in the year to June, while the RBA’s
  preferred underlying measure fell to 2.7% - which Hauser said was in line with
  the bank’s forecasts. Still, Hauser also flagged that the central bank was in
  no rush. Our strategy for some time is to set interest rates to bring
  inflation back sustainably – that’s an important word – to the midpoint of the
  2-3% target range, and to do that through a policy that is gradual,
  considered, measured. Financial markets are pricing in a rate cut on 12 August
  and another by the November board meeting. Jim Chalmers on morning TV refused
  to comment on likelihood of a rate cut next month. I try not to make
  predictions about decisions that the independent Reserve Bank will take about
  interest rates, but I’m really pleased that inflation has come down so
  substantially. It’s a powerful demonstration of the progress that Australians
  have made together in the fight against inflation. Labor votes against Greens
  amendment to early childhood bill The Senate has now moved to the early
  childhood bill the government has said it wants to be passed this week (ie
  today). The Greens are trying to move an amendment to the bill that would note
  “the need for broader reform” to make early childhood education universal, and
  calls on the government to establish an independent national Early Childhood
  Education and Care Commission. Labor votes against it with a handful of
  Liberal senators. They’ll now continue debating – the minister, Jess Walsh, is
  currently answering questions on the bill in the chamber – before they vote on
  the bill. Lidia Thorpe’s condolence motion passes in Senate Lidia Thorpe’s
  condolence motion extending its sympathies to the families of the 17 First
  Nations people who have died in custody this year, including 24-year-old
  Walpiri man Kumanjayi White, who died in May after being restrained by
  officers at an Alice Springs supermarket, has passed in the Senate. Tears as
  Marion Scrymgour says deaths in custody ‘catastrophic for my communities’ The
  Labor member for Lingiari, in the Northern Territory, Marion Scrymgour, is
  tearing up in the chamber, as she also speaks on Aboriginal deaths in custody.
  She says two of the First Nations people who have died in custody this year
  have been from the area that she represents. This issue weighs heavily on me.
  As an Aboriginal person from the Northern Territory, these deaths have been
  catastrophic for my communities. As a mother, as a grandmother, these deaths
  have weighed heavily on my communities. I hear their calls for justice,
  Speaker. After Kumanjayi Walker’s tragic passing in Alice Springs during
  Naidoc, I called for the investigation with minister McCarthy to look into his
  death and to have suitably qualified and authorised professionals from outside
  the Northern Territory police. We didn’t take that decision lightly, we did it
  because of the systemic racism and the issues between our Northern Territory
  police and Aboriginal people. Murray Watt says rate of Indigenous deaths in
  custody ‘unacceptable’ Both houses are speaking on Indigenous deaths in
  custody this morning. After Thorpe, Murray Watt says it is “simply
  unacceptable that 602 First Nations people have died in custody since the 1991
  royal commission”. In the House, Amanda Rishworth is speaking on behalf of
  Malarndirri McCarthy: The royal commission was clear that the best way to
  reduce Indigenous deaths in custody is to reduce the high incarceration rate
  of First Nations people, including through social and economic responses. This
  is what the commonwealth government is focusing on. McCarthy told RN Breakfast
  this morning that justice and preventing mass incarceration of adults and
  young First Nations people is a key focus of the government. Independent
  senator Lidia Thorpe has put forward a motion in the Senate this morning,
  extending sympathies to the families of the 17 First Nations people who have
  died in custody this year, including 24-year-old Walpiri man Kumanjayi White
  who died in May after being restrained by officers at an Alice Springs
  supermarket. Labor and the Greens have agreed to pass the motion acknowledging
  White’s death while extending its sympathies to the families of the 602
  Indigenous deaths in custody since the release of the 1991 Royal Commission
  into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The motion also called on all
  parliamentarians to work constructively together to address the
  over-incarceration and deaths of First Nations people in custody. While moving
  the motion, Thorpe said: These are not just statistics. They are sons,
  daughters, mothers, fathers, cousins, siblings, grandchildren – lost to a
  system that continues to harm our people ... This motion is about preventing
  that pain from continuing. It’s about doing what we can, here and now, to
  ensure that Kumanjayi’s death is not just another entry in a long and shameful
  list. It must be a turning point. Thorpe also spoke of the impact on her
  family after the death of her cousin, Joshua Kerr, a 32-year-old Yorta Yorta
  and Gunaikurnai man who died in custody in August 2022. The motion this
  morning coincides with the release of the latest Closing the Gap report, which
  revealed only four of 19 targets were on track to be met by 2031. The 2023-24
  data showed the national rate of Indigenous youths in detention had increased
  compared with the previous year. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is
  holding a press conference at West Melbourne police station before a statewide
  machete ban coming into effect. From 1 September, owning, carrying, using,
  buying or selling a machete without a valid exemption or approval will be a
  criminal offence in Victoria. The state is the first in Australia to impose a
  ban and it follows a similar move in the UK. Allan says there will be an
  amnesty period until 30 November and announced the location of more than 40
  safe disposal bins that will be available 24/7 at police stations across
  Victoria to allow people to safely dispose of machetes. Machetes destroy lives
  and there is no place for them on Victorian streets. That’s why we’ve already
  moved to bring about the ban on the sale of machetes – and that ban on the
  sale of machetes is working. We’ve already seen machetes not just being taken
  off the shelves of retail stores, they’re also been taken offline as well.
  Amazon has stopped putting machetes for sale online for the entire nation.
  Wiggles share post featuring Wags the Dog dressed in black after Anika Wells’
  ‘black skivvies’ remark The Wiggles have another cheeky nod to the
  communications minister, Anika Wells, referring to the bosses at Wiggles HQ as
  wearing “black skivvies” in a post promoting the children’s group’s latest
  tour. Wells said yesterday she was lobbied against including YouTube in the
  under 16s social media ban not by individual Wiggles, but “it was the black
  skivvies, it was Wiggles Inc, it was Wiggles management”. Wiggles HQ already
  fired back saying they don’t wear black skivvies, but in the promo video
  posted on Thursday it features Wags the Dog in Wiggles HQ dressed in black.
  The group said it was “Big Wiggles” news. Guardian Australia reported
  yesterday a planned Google event in Parliament House was cancelled last night
  after the ban was announced. Google said it was “out of respect for the
  grieving families” at Parliament House who were there representing their
  children who had lost their lives as a result of issues such as bullying on
  social media. Queensland government ‘buried’ pill-testing report The operators
  of Queensland’s former pill-testing scheme have claimed the state government
  has “buried” a report into the now-cancelled program. The Loop Australia
  submitted an RTI request for the documents but was denied on the basis that
  they may be considered by cabinet. The state government closed both testing
  sites in April this year, a year after it opened. About 700 people used the
  service during that time, according to the Loop Australia. The Loop’s chief
  executive, Cameron Francis, said there would be “increases in overdose deaths
  in the community” as a result of the decision. This service saved lives,
  reduced harm and linked people into vital health supports. Pill-testing
  provides a doorway into the health system. We connect with people who have
  previously been reluctant to engage with the health system. Greens say
  Australia should recognise Palestinian state The Greens say Australia should
  join with the other nations in moving to recognise a Palestinian state,
  including France, as well as the UK and Canada, both who have conditions to
  that recognition. Sarah Hanson-Young told Sky News this morning Australia
  should follow our allies but wouldn’t say whether that should be at the United
  Nations General Assembly in September. I think it is a matter of time, but
  we’re also running out of time because people are dying, and I wouldn’t want
  to see this just get caught up in some kind of diplomatic, bureaucratic
  process … It’s time to end the illegal occupation of Gaza, to have to get aid
  into Gaza so that people can eat and have clean water, and we also need to
  recognise the state of Palestine. The sooner Australia can lift our diplomatic
  voices and join with other countries in sending a very strong message …
  Whatever Australia can do, we should be doing. The Greens have also been
  calling for more sanctions on Israel. The deputy Nationals leader, Kevin
  Hogan, sitting on the Sky News panel with Hanson-Young, says there shouldn’t
  be a timeline for recognising Palestine. I certainly understand the will of
  recognising a Palestinian state. But who right now would you do that with?
  There’s a peace proposal on the table at the moment from Israel, but Hamas
  won’t accept that. They are a terrorist organisation. You cannot deal with a
  terrorist organisation. I hope they [the government] don’t put a timeline on
  it, in the sense there happens to be a meeting in September, so that’s when
  they do it. That is not the right way to do this. Malarndirri McCarthy says
  more work needed to reduce Indigenous incarceration The minister for
  Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, says she’s concerned about the
  number of young First Nations people in prisons. In the Northern Territory,
  which McCarthy represents in the Senate, the Territory government has been
  defending a controversial plan to reinstate spit hoods in it’s youth detention
  centres, a decade after they were banned. Youth justice is one of the areas
  where there’s been no improvement, according to the latest Closing the Gap
  data. McCarthy told RN Breakfast a bit earlier this morning that there are
  prisons in Alice Springs where nearly 50% of prisoners are on remand, where
  young people are in overcrowded watch houses while they are going through the
  court process. It’s really tough when you have states who are focused on
  youth, in particular with the incarceration of young, Indigenous youth,
  certainly in the high rates of Indigenous people across here in the Northern
  Territory. Why is it that we see so many young people before the courts who
  are in watch houses, who are in overcrowding? Even the corrections staff have
  told me this, the police association of the Northern Territory has told me
  this. These are really worrying trends we see. McCarthy says justice is an
  area the government is “pursuing vigorously” to improve but also says the
  areas that are improving are “heartening to see”. Details of PM and Keir
  Starmer’s phone call revealed The prime minister spoke to his UK counterpart,
  Keir Starmer, last night, to discuss the war in Gaza. We’ve received a read
  out of the phone call, which states “the leaders agreed on the importance of
  using the international momentum to secure a ceasefire, the release of all
  hostages and the acceleration of aid, as well as ensuring Hamas did not play a
  role in a future state”. Albanese said during his press conference yesterday
  that he’d already spoken to Starmer before he announced that the UK would move
  to recognise a Palestinian state. In the latest call, the leaders also
  discussed Aukus and “welcomed the progress being made by all partners”. James
  Paterson says recognising Palestinian statehood would ‘lose all leverage over
  the Palestinian Authority’ The shadow finance minister, James Paterson, says
  recognising Palestine today would mean recognising a state “which is in part
  governed by a terrorist organisation”. Paterson says Hamas has shown “no
  interest” in demilitarising or returning hostages – two key conditions held by
  the Australian government. Canada is the latest country to declare its
  intention to recognise Palestinian statehood, after the UK and France.
  Paterson tells Sky News Australia shouldn’t follow based on an “artificial
  measure of momentum”. We should only recognise that Palestinian state after
  peace has been agreed and achieved, because otherwise you lose all leverage
  over the Palestinian Authority. They desperately want to achieve this
  international recognition, and they would be willing to do some things in
  exchange for that, including forswearing their desire to destroy the State of
  Israel in exchange for it. But if you hand over that recognition, you have no
  further leverage to expect them to negotiate over. Yesterday, Labor MP Ed
  Husic said momentum in Australia is building and that Hamas is “built largely
  on grievance”, which he said would be removed with the establishment of a
  Palestinian state. This morning, Canada has announced that it plans to
  recognise a Palestinian state, putting more pressure on Australia to do the
  same. The Australian government has said it’s a matter of “when, not if” a
  Palestinian state is recognised, but Canada joins key allies planning to do it
  by September at the UN General Assembly. In a statement, Canada’s prime
  minister, Mark Carney, says prospects for a two-state solution have been
  “steadily and gravely eroded” by the “pervasive threat of Hamas terrorism and
  its “violent rejection of Israel’s right to exist”, the accelerated settlement
  building by Israelis and settler violence, and the “ongoing failure by the
  Israeli government to prevent the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian disaster
  in Gaza”. Carney says the plan is conditional, and predicated on the
  Palestinian Authority’s commitment to reforms including: The commitments by
  Palestinian Authority president Abbas to fundamentally reform its governance,
  to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to
  demilitarise the Palestinian state. Canada will increase its efforts in
  supporting strong, democratic governance in Palestine and the contributions of
  its people to a more peaceful and hopeful future. Jim Chalmers says delay in
  US sending new ambassador ‘not unusual’ Moving on to the Today Show, Chalmers
  is facing more questions about the relationship between the US and Australia.
  There are a few elements to it this morning – there’s the tariff situation,
  the delay in the Aukus review (which the administration announced yesterday
  would be completed this spring, outside the original 30-day timeline), and the
  fact that the US hasn’t sent over a new ambassador to Australia. It’s not
  super uncommon for the charges d’affaires (the second in charge in an embassy)
  to be the No 1 in charge for a while until an ambassador is selected. Under
  the last Trump administration, Donald Trump took two years to appoint veteran
  Republican lawyer Arthur B Culvahouse Jr to the role – and it took another
  couple of months on top of that for the US Senate to approve him. Chalmers
  says it’s “not unusual” for countries to take time to appoint an ambassador,
  and that “it hasn’t prevented us from working closely with the Americans”. He
  rejects the assertion that there’s a lot of “uncertainty” in the relationship
  and also says it’s “not unusual” for the new government to review the Aukus
  deal. Well, I’m not sure about that. I think that might be overdoing it but,
  more broadly, there’s a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. We’re seeing
  that play out. Tariffs are part of that. National security considerations are
  part of that as well. Anika Wells on social media ban: ‘We can’t police the
  ocean, but we can police the sharks’ The communications minister has explained
  the government is restricting children’s YouTube access instead of targeting
  social media companies’ responsibilities with an analogy that while it is
  impossible to police the ocean, they are “going to have a crack” at policing
  the sharks. Anika Wells appeared on ABC’s 7.30 program yesterday evening after
  news this week that children will be banned from having YouTube accounts from
  December, with the federal government backflipping on an earlier decision to
  exempt the video platform from the national under-16s social media
  restrictions. In response to being asked if the bigger question was not why
  social media companies are putting vile material on their platforms in the
  first place, Wells said: It is a question for the social media platforms.
  YouTube uploads 500 hours of content every 60 seconds. If you could put all of
  that social media content in a library, it would be the world’s worst library.
  You wouldn’t allow your child to walk into it, but the internet is here. The
  internet is ubiquitous. I’ve got little kids. We are all trying our best.
  Parents are trying their best, but it is like trying to teach your kids to
  swim in an open ocean with rips and sharks rather than at the pool. We can’t
  police the ocean, but we can police the sharks. We’re going to have a crack at
  it. Wells said the government remains committed to a plan that will also see
  legal responsibility put on social media companies to prevent harmful content
  on their platforms. On to international issues, Chalmers is asked whether
  Australia could recognise a Palestinian state by September for the UN meeting
  – as the UK said it will do, unless Israel takes “substantive steps” to end
  the conflict and commit to a peace process. Chalmers says he won’t put a
  timeframe on it but it’s “a matter of when, not if” – echoing comments made by
  both the prime minister and other ministers yesterday. There are a number of
  obstacles still in the way to recognition of a Palestinian state. For example,
  the treatment, the release of the hostages, making sure that there’s
  absolutely no role for Hamas. These are the sorts of things that the
  international community is working through. But that statement that came out
  yesterday that we signed as Australians via our foreign minister, Penny Wong,
  is a really important one. Chalmers is also asked about the tariff situation
  and says the government hasn’t “heard any different from the 10% baseline
  that’s been levied on Australia”. Donald Trump has said this week more
  countries could be levied at 15% to 20%. Chalmers won’t rule out Australia
  being hit with a higher rate. I think it would be a brave person to assume
  that there won’t be, whether it’s with other countries or – there will always
  be more announcements about this. These tariff announcements are a moving
  feast. But our expectation is we get the baseline. Jim Chalmers says Australia
  ‘needs to do much better’ on Closing the Gap Jim Chalmers starts on ABC News
  Breakfast this morning. He’s pretty happy with the inflation numbers and says
  the first two rate cuts this year were “very, very welcome” relief, but he
  won’t predict if there’ll be another. Asked about the latest Closing the Gap
  data, Chalmers says Australia “needs to do much better” and that some outcomes
  have gone backwards in “worrying ways”. Minister Malarndirri McCarthy is
  working in her characteristically diligent way with all of the stakeholders,
  all of the communities, to try to turn these numbers around. There has been
  progress in 10 of the 15. There has been some worrying outcomes in the rest,
  but overall, we need to do more and we need to do better. McCarthy and the
  prime minister will be visiting the Garma festival this weekend, held in
  remote north-east Arnhem Land. Good morning, Krishani Dhanji here with you for
  the final sitting day of the fortnight, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us
  started! Jim Chalmers is doing the media rounds this morning, off the back of
  what he called “outstanding” inflation data yesterday. The government has said
  it wants its childcare bill to be passed through parliament this week, which
  leaves today for it to be voted through the Senate (it has the support of the
  Coalition and the Greens). And as Martin brought you earlier, we’ll be
  following the reaction to the latest Closing the Gap data. Stay with us, it’s
  going to be a big one! Closing the Gap review finds community controlled
  organisations key to progress The new data follows a recent review of the
  Closing the Gap agreement, commissioned by the Coalition of Peaks. The review
  found Indigenous community controlled organisations are key to progress, and
  governments must listen to First Nations people and share decision-making
  power to create positive change. Productivity commissioner Selwyn Button said
  the review shows the outcomes of the agreement are falling well short of what
  governments have committed to. What the outcomes in the agreement reflect most
  of all is the limited progress of governments in collectively acting on the
  priority reforms: sharing decision-making and data with communities;
  strengthening the Aboriginal community controlled sector and changing the way
  governments operate. Coalition of Peaks Lead Convenor Pat Turner said
  improvements in early education enrolments, employment and land and sea rights
  show what’s possible when government partner with Indigenous organisations “in
  the right way”. But she said when governments fail to meet their commitments
  to work with community controlled organisations the gap widens. What’s
  important for Australians to understand is that Aboriginal community
  controlled organisations are not fringe services. We’re not asking for special
  treatment. We’re asking for a fair share. When we get that, we deliver. These
  are the Closing the Gap socioeconomic outcomes in the latest report in detail:
  89.2% of babies were born with a healthy birthweight (improvement, but not on
  track) 94.2% of children were enrolled in preschool (on track) 33.9% of
  children commencing school were developmentally on track (worsening) 2,304 out
  of every 100,000 adults were in prison (worsening) 26 out of every 10,000
  young people were in detention (no change) 50 out of every 1,000 children were
  in out-of-home care (worsening) 31 out of every 100,000 people took their own
  life (worsening) 4.3 million sq km of land were subject to Indigenous rights
  or interests (on track) 113,517 sq km of sea were subject to Indigenous rights
  or interests (on track) 88% of people used the internet (no assessment)
  Closing the Gap results ‘unacceptable’ “It’s not enough to hope the gap will
  close, governments must hold themselves to account for the commitments they’ve
  made under the national agreement,” Coalition of Peaks lead convener Pat
  Turner said of the latest Closing the Gap report. “That requires smart
  investment, longer-term flexible funding and full implementation of the four
  priority reforms – shifting power, not just policy. “Without real power shift,
  we’ll keep seeing the same patterns repeat, and our people will continue to
  pay the price.” The Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council chief
  executive, Paula Arnol, said the latest Closing the Gap report card was
  disappointing. “It’s 2025 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are
  still not experiencing the health outcomes that non-Indigenous Australians
  enjoy. This is unacceptable,” she said. Without changing the approach to
  Closing the Gap, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will continue to
  “pay the price”, Indigenous organisations say. Just four of the 19 Closing the
  Gap targets are on track to be met, according to the latest data from the
  Productivity Commission, Australian Associated Press reports. But key targets,
  including adult imprisonment rates, children in out-of-home care, suicide and
  childhood development, are continuing to worsen. While there have been
  improvements in year 12 attainment, tertiary education and housing access,
  these are not on track to meet deadlines. Good morning and welcome to our live
  politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it
  will be Krishani Dhanji with the main action. The latest Closing the Gap
  report has been released this morning and it shows that progress is being made
  on only four of the 19 targets. Indigenous groups and advocates say
  governments need to do more. More details coming up. Anika Wells, the
  communications minister, appeared on 7.30 last night to explain the
  government’s decision to restrict children’s YouTube access. More details
  coming up on that as well.

We’ll leave our live coverage of the day’s news there for this evening. That’s the end of the 48th parliament’s first sitting fortnight. Krishani Dhanji will be back on the blog when MPs crowd back into Canberra on 25 August. Until then, Guardian Australia’s Nick Visser will keep you across each day’s breaking news. Here were today’s major updates: Tony Burke says he’s “optimistic” about the US-Australia security relationship after a quiet meeting with the FBI director Kash Patel. Jim Chalmers said Australian recognition of a Palestinian state was “a matter of when, not if” while Penny Wong said the government is “of course” considering moving to recognise a Palestinian state in September in line with Canada, the United Kingdom and France. Wong also admitted it was not possible to track if goods from sanctioned nations might be imported via a third country, after reports an oil tanker docked in Western Australia could be carrying Russian fuel processed in India. Labor has scheduled debate on Barnaby Joyce’s bill to drop net zero targets for when parliament returns next month, pressuring the opposition on net zero. The Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, backed Labor’s childcare bill but warned the “next part is very difficult” ahead of a federal, state and territory ministers’ meeting next month to reform the working with children checks system and discuss rules around CCTV footage. And Elon Musk’s X has lost a court case where it tried to claim that a notice issued to Twitter over its tackling of child sexual abuse material did not account for the company “ceasing to exist” when X Corp merged with Twitter in March 2023. Thanks for staying with us. See you tomorrow. Public Service Commissioner says he has been cleared over robodebt inquiry The Australian Public Service commissioner says he has been cleared of any wrongdoing over his role in the robodebt code of conduct inquiry after two complaints were made against him following the agency’s release of its report into the 12 public servants who it found had breached the code of conduct 97 times during their involvement in the debt recovery program. The commissioner, Gordon de Brouwer, said the merit protection commissioner had finalised its inquiries into the 10 allegations made against him, including that he failed to act impartially, released inaccurate and damaging information and improperly disclosed information. De Brouwer said the statement, released on Thursday afternoon, was necessary after a member of the public obtained relevant documents through a freedom of information request. He said: Given that I am reasonably identifiable in the documents, it is in the public interest to address any speculation on this matter and to maintain the reputation of the office of Australian Public Service Commissioner. The APSC’s report, released last September, found 12 public servants, including former department heads Kathryn Campbell and Renée Leon, breached the code of conduct 97 times. As a result, the two former agency heads now have to declare the findings, if asked, for the next five years if they try to get work in the Australian public service or as a contractor. The other 10 public servants, including four that were still employed by the Australian public service at the time, were not named. The four still employed at the time faced a range of sanctions from demotion to reprimands and fines if they remained employed. Ten unions support pro-Palestine protest involving march across Sydney Harbour Bridge Ten unions are among the more than 60 organisations who have sent an open letter to the NSW premier urging him to facilitate a protest that would involve marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge this Sunday. The letter, addressed to Chris Minns, said: The Sydney Harbour Bridge has a rich history of democratic community action, including the 2000 Walk for Reconciliation and the 2023 World Pride march. Seeking to shut down this rally would be a serious departure from the NSW State and Police’s responsibility to uphold the democratic right of protest. The NSW branches of the unions which have signed on to the letter include: Nurses and Midwives Association Teachers Federation Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Public Service Association United Workers Union Australian Services Union Electrical Trades Union Independent Education Union National Tertiary Education Union Maritime Union of Australia, Sydney branch Minns said on Tuesday he was not questioning the motives of the protesters, just the route, saying he would not close the bridge “for any circumstances”. He acknowledged there was widespread community concern about the war in Gaza. Labor and Liberal MPs not keen to comment on Burke’s FBI meeting Tony Burke’s unannounced meeting with the Trump-appointed FBI director, Kash Patel, has drawn the ire of the Greens, but MPs in the two major parties aren’t so keen to comment. Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie and Labor’s Jerome Laxale were on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, discussing reforms to the early childhood education sector and new Australian federal police allegations against an after-school carer. Conversation then turned to Burke’s quiet dinner with Patel while the FBI chief was in the region to open a new office in New Zealand. McKenzie said she had no comment on the meeting as she had been busy with her legislative work. To be fair I have been so focused on early childhood this week and indeed the education legislation going through the chamber that I have nothing to add on that, I’ll leave the Labor party to [that]. Laxale also demurred: I’m sorry, I will have to let this one go through the keeper as well. I’ve been dealing with the breaking news of the AFP all afternoon, so I’m not aware of this reporting or these plans, you may have to ask your next guest. Tony Burke says he’s “optimistic” about what the US and Australia “can achieve together in the interest of national security” after a quiet meeting with the Federal Bureau of Investigations director. The home affairs minister had dinner with the FBI chief, Kash Patel, who was in the region to open the bureau’s first ever office in New Zealand on Thursday. In a statement, Burke said: We share a commitment to keeping our people safe, and I’m optimistic about what we can achieve together in the interest of national security. The new FBI office in New Zealand was set up to counter China’s activities in the Indo-Pacific, and crack down on cybercrime. Burke did not say whether Australia was considering allowing the FBI to open a similar office in the country. Patel is a Donald Trump ally, who has made headlines in recent weeks amid the Jeffrey Epstein controversy and previously praised the QAnon conspiracy-theory movement. Shadow minister for Indigenous Australians offers full support for Labor to turn around worsening outcomes The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians has offered Labor support to turn around worsening outcomes for First Nations communities as new data shows just four of 19 Closing the Gap targets are on track. Youth and adult imprisonment rates, children in out-of-home care, suicide and childhood development are among the outcomes continuing to deteriorate. Kerrynne Liddle, also the Coalition’s spokesperson for social services, said she wanted to help the government turn things around. She said: The minister talks about bipartisanship and she has my full support as I am sure she does many people, to actually focus and make progress in these issues. I’ve been calling from the beginning for more accountability on how the funding has been spent and what progress it is making in terms of outcomes … It’s also about bureaucrats doing more about those programs, that they manage to make sure that they are being delivered in the way it was intended. Liddle also endorsed the Northern Territory government’s move to reintroduce the use of spit hoods in youth detention centres. I wouldn’t appreciate being spat at. I’m sure nobody would appreciate that in the workplace. But [what] we need to do is work with these children earlier … so that they don’t feel the need to just spit at people. The FBI chief, Kash Patel, has met with the minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, Penny Wong has confirmed, drawing criticism from the Greens. The director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation today opened the bureau’s first-ever office in New Zealand in what he said was an attempt to help counter China’s activities in the Indo-Pacific, crack down on issues including cybercrime and strengthen protection of the Five Eyes nations. Wong declined to say whether she supported the FBI expansion but confirmed Patel met Burke, speaking to the ABC. Patel is a Donald Trump ally who has made headlines in recent weeks over the Jeffrey Epstein controversy and previously praised the QAnon conspiracy-theory movement. Greens senator David Shoebridge criticised what he described as “secret meetings,” demanding Burke share what he discussed with Patel. He told the ABC: Meetings that nobody knew about with a highly controversial Trump appointee … That’s not a good look for any government … I can understand why Minister Burke wanted nobody to know about it but they have an obligation to be honest with the Australian public, and not to be meeting behind closed doors without telling the public. Penny Wong has said the government is “of course” considering moving to recognise a Palestinian state in September in line with Canada, the United Kingdom and France. The foreign minister said the Albanese government welcomed Canada’s announcement it planned on a conditional recognition of a state of Palestine in which Hamas had no part when the United Nations’ general assembly meets. Asked whether Australia remained open to a similar declaration in September, Wong said: Of course these are discussions which are ongoing … This is something that we are thinking very carefully about, just as we think carefully about what can we do to contribute to bring about the ceasefire in Gaza. We know we are not a central player but what we can do is what we have done which is call for cease-fire, join with others. Wong would not be drawn on whether Labor was committed to matching leading allies, reiterating the government’s focus on securing peace through a two-state solution. She told the ABC: We welcome the momentum towards the pathway to peace and that is what two states is about. … I hope what happens in New York in September is we see the hostages released, we see the commitments from the Palestinian Authority and others in the region about the security of Israel, the demilitarisation of the Palestinian state and a move towards recognition … That’s what we want. Retail sales grow by fastest in more than two years Households have picked up their retail spending by the most since 2023, easing concerns that sales to consumers were collapsing. The final release of retail sales data shows household spending picked up 1.2% from May to June, taking the annual lift to 4.9%. Household goods retail sales rose a strong 2.3% over the month, helped by furniture and a big swing in electrical goods, which Robert Ewing, the ABS head of business statistics, attributed to the Nintendo Switch 2: After steady growth throughout the year, mid-year sales events increased spending on discretionary items like furniture, electrical goods and clothing items Turnover for electrical and gaming retailers was lifted further by the much-anticipated launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which delivered record sales. Analysts at UBS said the uptick was enough to allay concerns spending could slide, writing in a note: We could now be seeing a shift in consumer spending momentum under way, after having earlier disappointed. Tailwinds of rising household disposable income from tax and interest rate cuts and still low unemployment should support [spending]. The ABS looked back at the statistics series in farewell before it’s replaced with new spending data, and noticed a major change in household’s spending. Food once was the single biggest share of household final consumption expenditure – at one-sixth in 1964 – but fell to less than a tenth of spending by 2024. Housing costs are now the biggest expense, up from about a tenth in 1964 to a quarter in 2024. Thanks so much to Krishani Dhanji for guiding us through the first sitting fortnight of the 48th parliament! I’ll be with you for the rest of the day’s news. That’s it from me today, thank you so much for joining me on the blog this sitting fortnight. I’ll leave you with the wonderful Luca Ittimani for the rest of the afternoon. Despite the vague lack of energy in the chamber, there were a lot of energy questions today for Chris Bowen about whether energy prices have been increasing or decreasing. The government’s dixers were predictable – Hecs, penalty rates, healthcare and energy – but Jason Clare did provide an update on protecting children in childcare, which was supported by the opposition leader, Sussan Ley. Liberal MP Ben Small got kicked out. Helen Haines asked what the government will do for the tens of thousands of people waiting for a home care package before the government brings more online (the packages were supposed to be rolled out from July 1). The government didn’t provide any specific measures. Look, we’re at the end of the sitting fortnight, and some people (including Jim Chalmers) could not have walked out of the chamber faster as soon as QT was over. Delving back into question time briefly, there was a moment of unity in the chamber over the government’s childcare bill. During a dixer, the education minister, Jason Clare, addressed the latest allegations relating to a childcare worker in New South Wales. This is the start, not the end. To be brutally honest, this work will never end. And the sickening (alleged) news we heard from the Australian Federal Police in the last few hours is a reminder of why this is so important. There is a lot of work we need to do together to rebuild trust and confidence in the system that parents need to have confidence in. Jason Clare and the attorney general, Michelle Rowland, will meet with their state and territory counterparts next month to reform the working with children checks system and discuss rules around CCTV footage. Sussan Ley stood up afterward and said the government had done good work but that the “next part is very difficult”. Sitting down with the states and territories, as we have all done in ministerial positions in the past, can descend into a talkfest and ministers depart to their state and nothing happens. We cannot afford to have that this time. There have been so many points of order today, the opposition have even made a point of order on a dixer. The PM tried to have a bit of a go at the “split” opposition when he was watching Sky News this week: There was a national leader in the studio with Laura Jayes but in the corner in the little box there was … the renegades out the front along with one or two Liberals in the corner. A split screen showing a split party. He’s talking about the press conference that Barnaby Joyce and a group of other Coalition members made raging about net zero. Alex Hawke gets up, to no avail, and Anthony Albanese says he misses the former manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher. Every time the new manager of opposition business gets up you feel a little nostalgic for Paul Fletcher. Joni Mitchell was right, you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone. Put me in a big yellow taxi and get me outta here … with that, QT is over for another day. Opposition continue attacks over quarterly power price rise Bowen is back, with another question from the opposition on whether today’s data by the Australian Energy Regulator shows energy prices are going up or down. Despite all the numbers – which we don’t always get in question time – we don’t seem to be getting particularly far on the issue today. Bowen says prices have risen in the last quarter, but as per his previous answer, prices have gone down since Labor first came into government. Quarterly price rises, wholesale prices rose. That is what the report said, thanks for noticing. Bowen says that the reason wholesale prices have dropped over the last three and a bit years is because of all the new renewable energy that the government has helped bring online. Earlier in Senate question time, the independent senator Fatima Payman asked Penny Wong about reports of an oil tanker docked in Western Australia believed to be carrying Russian fuel processed in India. While Australia has joined other nations in banning the import of Russian oil in response to its invasion in Ukraine, it’s possible Russian oil is still being sold in Australia after it has been refined in a third country. Payman asked Wong whether the Albanese government had assurances Russian oil was not being sold in the country, given the sanctions imposed on them. Wong responded: I’ve said publicly, regrettably, the mechanisms we would need to track and monitor all energy products via third countries, are not in place in those countries, and obviously, we’ll continue to look at what options we can utilise to place further pressure on Russia’s oil revenues ... Australians do expect businesses to try and avoid their supply chains from inadvertently funding Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Certainly, the government does call on businesses to uphold that responsibility. But the answer to the question, Senator, is … we have sanctioned. We’ve increased those sanctions, including on the shadow fleet. But secondly, regrettably, there are not the mechanisms in third countries to enable all of the issues you raised to be tracked. Albanese agrees with Katter than Glencore ‘should back the town that backed them’ after factory closures We’re back to the crossbench, and Bob Katter asks the prime minister about the closure of the Mount Isa underground copper operation, owned by Swiss multinational Glencore. He also asks whether the government will initiate an east coast gas reservation policy to protect industry, including the Mount Isa fertiliser plant. Anthony Albanese acknowledges the workers who are losing their jobs with the closure – around 500 – and says Katter is right to call the closure out. Australia has been good to Glencore and they need to be good back to Australia. They should back the town that has backed them and has helped build the wealth of their shareholders … I assure the member I will continue to work constructively with him, as I always have, and that the industry minister is very engaged in this issue along with a whole of government response. Katter’s son, the Queensland state MP Robbie Katter, is also in the House today in the public gallery. Chalmers on superannuation: it’s possible to disagree with Paul Keating The shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, is up now, and asks Jim Chalmers about the superannuation tax. He quotes Paul Keating, who’s told the media the tax is “unconscionable” and asks Chalmers whether Keating, his political idol, is wrong. “No disrespect to Paul,” Chalmers says, but sometimes they don’t agree on policy. It is a matter of public record that I value my relationship with Paul Keating, someone I have known for a long time and somebody who I continue to admire. It is possible to admire Paul Keating and respect him and to occasionally have a different view to Paul Keating and this is what has happened on this occasion and I have said that publicly on a number of occasions, no disrespect to Paul when I say it. He ends saying “I won’t be taking lectures on superannuation from those opposite” and accuses the Coalition of “hating” super. Aged care minister says additional 80,000 home care packages to be rolled out from November The next crossbench question goes to Helen Haines, who asks the government what they’re doing to help families who are waiting for home care packages that have been delayed. She says the government ignored calls to bridge the gap by immediately funding 20,000 home care packages. There are currently 87,000 people on the home care wait list. Sam Rae, the new aged care minister, says he acknowledges that the Australian population is ageing and demand for home care packages are growing. After an interjection from Haines, asking what the government will do before the promised packages come online, Rae still won’t detail exactly how the government will look after those still waiting. From 1 November, [the government] will roll out an additional 80,000 packages in the first 12 months. Until then, over the course of the period between now and November my number one priority is ensuring that older people continue [to] receive the care and services that they need, and until November we continue to assign the packages each and every week in accordance with the national priority system. Bowen defends answer as power prices pursuit continues Bowen is back… again. Another new MP, Liberal Leon Rebello, asks Bowen about a report released today that says wholesale energy prices have risen in Queensland in the last quarter by 25% and risen in Victoria in the last quarter by 21%. So did Bowen ignore those figures in Bowen’s previous answer? Bowen says that the question he received was the difference in price between now and when the government was elected – not the last quarter. “I apologise for using the frame that was put to me,” Bowen says. The CSIRO has found that renewables, including cost associated with additional storage and transmission remain the lowest-cost, lowest built-cost technology. Again, I should have issued a trigger warning that I was going to mention the CSIRO and science. Just a bit of a dig at the end there ... Liberal MP ejected for an hour as Bowen continues to field questions over power bills Well we’ve established a clear pattern in the opposition’s questions today. David Batt, a new LNP MP, asks Chris Bowen why Christine, a resident in his electorate, has been “forced to return to work” as electricity bills and rents increase. But before Bowen gets into his answer, we have our first eviction of QT today! It’s new WA Liberal MP (and former senator) Ben Small, who’s ejected for one hour. Remember: the new House rules mean a member can be ejected for either one hour or up to three hours. Anyway, back to Bowen’s answer, he says the government is working to help bring Christine’s energy bills down. He says renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy, which he accuses the opposition of being “prejudiced against”. Staying on energy, the shadow minister, Dan Tehan, asks Chris Bowen if the government will hit its target of 82% renewables by 2030. Bowen stands up and almost makes the commitment but then says … I can absolutely confirm … that it is this government’s intention to continue to work towards that target. That gets a quick groan from the opposition. We all know intention doesn’t necessarily mean it will happen – but Bowen adds that the government is making “good progress”, including having brought 4.4 gigawatts of energy online in the last financial year. Dan Tehan makes a point of relevance and asks for some reverence (insert chuckles here) and says that his question wasn’t about intention. The speaker, Milton Dick, says this is a “bad path” and let’s just not get into semantics. Bowen continues, saying that the government at least has a target that while those opposite don’t. He also mentions the “bromance” between Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack – the two Nationals senators leading the charge for dumping net zero within the party. Keogh says veteran and family hubs are being established as promised The first question from the crossbench comes from former Nationals MP turned independent Andrew Gee, who says parts of his community want to set up wellbeing hubs for veterans and their families. He asks the minister if he’ll come and visit Bathurst and Orange who want to establish them. Matt Keogh says he’d be happy to visit the two towns in Gee’s electorate, and that the hubs are being established as promised at the 2022 election. We went to the 2022 election, we made a commitment to rolling out 10 veterans and families hubs across the country, we made sure that we selected locations based on the highest concentrations of veterans and families around the country … [they are] the priority area[s] to focus on rolling out those hubs and it means that we are now in the process of having opened and are rolling out some 17 veterans’ and families hubs. Ley continues targeting power bills in question time Sussan Ley steps up again for the second question, this time to Chris Bowen, asking what the average monthly household power bill is today compared with when Labor took office three years ago. Bowen is speeding through some numbers, The Queensland bill is $139 and the average [bill on] election day was $347.28. In South Australia the average today is $125 and average on election day was $312.30. But before he gets too far, Ley stands up and says despite the “rapid-fire delivery”, he’s actually giving wholesale power prices rather than answering her question. The speaker, Milton Dick, says the point of order isn’t an opportunity to add new stuff to the question. Bowen starts again with some new numbers – which honestly can barely be heard because everyone is shouting in the chamber. After everyone settles (because Dick tells them to), Bowen continues: We on this side of the house agree that Australians have looked and will continue to look to the government to do more to assist on household energy bills. The work is far from done, we delivered three rounds of energy bill relief but we recognise that around the world, including in Australia, our prices hit higher than anyone would like. But that is why we have taken such action. Sussan Ley starts question time on the cost of energy. She asks why 63,000 more Australian families are on hardship assistance arrangements for their power bills today than on the day Labor took office three years ago. Anthony Albanese says the government has provided three lots of energy bill relief for households, and talks about the government’s intervention to cap prices in the gas market. He then tries to bring up a question from yesterday’s question time from Liberal MP Mary Aldred. Ley stands up on a point of order and says the PM isn’t saying why families are struggling. The speaker, Milton Dick, doesn’t take Ley’s side on this one, and Albanese finishes his answer talking about the home battery scheme (which also got a lot of mentions in QT yesterday by Chris Bowen) and arguing that the opposition’s solution was to propose building nuclear power plants. A disgraced state MP who sexually abused two young men has suffered yet another court defeat, AAP reports. Kiama MP Gareth Ward, 44, was convicted earlier in July in the NSW district court of sexual intercourse without consent and three indecent assaults. A day after being denied bail while he waits to be sentenced, his defamation lawsuit against radio station 2SM was heard in the district court. The nature of the defamation allegations was not revealed in a brief court hearing on Thursday – except that it related to his recent criminal convictions. Ward’s lawyer asked that the defamation case be adjourned until after his sentence hearing on 19 September and while he considers appeal avenues. But Judge Judith Gibson knocked back that suggestion and removed the case from the court’s inactive list, instead setting the matter down for a directions hearing on 11 September. The judge noted that Ward’s conviction would be “important” in the proceedings, but added it was unlikely his sentence would be finalised on 19 September. “I don’t think that standing it over for close to a month is going to achieve anything much,” Gibson told the court. Lawyers for 2SM indicated they wanted the defamation matter dealt with as soon as possible. In February 2013, Ward invited a drunk 18-year-old man, whom he met a year before, to his South Coast home. The man told the jury at trial Ward plied him with drinks before indecently assaulting him three times in one night, despite his attempts to resist. The long-time MP also sexually assaulted an intoxicated political staffer after a mid-week event at NSW Parliament House in 2015. The man, who was 24 at the time but is now in his 30s, said Ward climbed into bed with him, groped his backside and sexually assaulted him despite him repeatedly saying “no”. The Nationals to ‘settle’ on net zero position ‘in coming months’ The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, says his party will come to a settled position on net zero “in the next couple of months”, and strongly backed the ability of his members to bring forth private members’ bills on topics like this. Of course this comes in the context of Barnaby Joyce putting up a bill to scrap the net zero target. Littleproud, asked about his party’s efforts in the first fortnight of parliament, said it was healthy for democracy for bills to be debated. “This place is about democracy … I think it’s a great thing that we have members of parliament, in the Senate and in the House of Reps, who come and bring forward private members’ bills that are important to their districts or important to this country,” Littleproud told a press conference. We should never try and subvert that process. Littleproud said the Nationals wouldn’t be “kicking it down the road too long”, adding that their answer on net zero would come in coming months. I’m pretty comfortable with that process, but we’ll be sure to nail our position. There is some drama going down in the house at the moment! Labor is moving to maximise pressure on the opposition on net zero by scheduling debate on Barnaby Joyce’s private member’s bill, for when parliament returns next month. It’s a tactical play, and has split Joyce and his colleague Michael McCormack, who is voting with the rest of the Coalition, against allowing debate on it. Joyce voted with the government to debate his own bill. Boarding call for furry friends In news outside politics, Virgin Airlines says it should be ready to allow our furry friends on domestic flights by the end of 2025. Last week, the food ministers’ meeting (today I also learned there’s a dedicated meeting for federal, state and territory food ministers) allowed small cats and dogs to be permitted on flights in controlled conditions. Virgin’s CEO, David Emerson, reportedly a summit in Cairns today that it’s been a “longer process than we thought” to get pets on board, but it will soon finally happen: We’re looking forward to launching before the end of the year. The opposition tried to move amendments noting that the government “failed to consult meaningfully with Australian small businesses” on the impact of the bill, and that the government should provide a regulatory impact statement immediately. The crossbench was split on the Coalition’s amendments – Allegra Spender, Monique Ryan and Kate Chaney voted with the Coalition, while Nicolette Boele, Sophie Scamps, Rebekah Sharkie, Helen Haines, Dai Le and Zali Steggall voted with the government to reject the amendment. The government put forward an amendments to its own bill – that has now passed, and will be sent over to the Senate. In another episode of politicians doing politics, during the debate, employment minister, Amanda Rishworth, tried testing her shadow counterpart Tim Wilson to say that the opposition doesn’t support penalty rates. Wilson countered saying the Coalition does support penalty rates, and was trying to get the government to say how many small businesses will be impacted by this legislation. Coalition’s efforts to investigate decision to allow US beef imports shot down Labor and the Greens have shot down the Coalition’s attempt to investigate the decision to allow more beef imports from the US. The Coalition has been calling for an independent review into the decision, and senator Matt Canavan put forward the motion to have the processes and advice provided by the department looked at by a committee. The decision to lift restrictions came after the Trump administration had publicly criticised the import blocks, but the government said Australia’s biosecurity won’t be weakened, and the decision was separate from discussions on trade tariffs. ABC ‘deeply concerned’ about health and safety of freelance journalists in Gaza The ABC is calling on Israel to allow international journalists to report independently from Gaza and is “deeply concerned” about the health and safety of freelance journalists it works with on the ground. ABC news director, Justin Stevens, wrote in a statement that the ABC is the “only Australian media organisation with a permanent presence in the region and we have repeatedly tried to get reporters back into Gaza”. The ABC relies on a “network of freelanced journalists and individuals on the ground”, and Stevens said the organisation is “seeing the effects of food shortages on journalists we work with”. We rely on a network of freelance journalists and individuals on the ground to tell the story of what they are witnessing. We are deeply concerned about their health and safety. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 186 journalists and media workers, mostly Palestinian, have been killed while gathering evidence of the war inside Gaza since 7 October. That number includes journalists who have done work for the ABC. We’re now seeing the effects of food shortages on journalists we work with. ABC Middle East correspondent, Matthew Doran, wrote about the deteriorating situation for journalists last week, describing one colleague he has worked with in Gaza who has lost 34kg and said he “does not have the strength to hold a camera any more”. As cost-of-living pressures continue to hit households around the country, the Greens say they will push a bill to make price-gouging illegal in the new parliament. The Greens treasury spokesperson, Nick McKim, plans to reintroduce legislation on Thursday. It is aimed at increasing pressure on Labor and follows a similar promise from the Albanese government during the election campaign. McKim said: Coles and Woolworths are using their enormous market power to squeeze every last dollar they can from people just trying to feed their families. The Greens’ bill would give the competition watchdog the power to investigate and prosecute corporations that exploit their market power to hike prices unfairly. We welcomed Labor’s election promise to ban supermarket price gouging, but since the election we’ve seen no action. Labor needs to honour their promise and take action against the profiteering supermarket corporations.” Education department ‘ready to act swiftly’ against childcare centres not meeting standards Going back briefly to Jason Clare’s press conference earlier, the education minister said his department will “act swiftly” against underperforming childcare centres when the new legislation passes parliament. The bill to crackdown on childcare providers with poor safety standards could pass the parliament today. Clare told us earlier this week that, once the bill passes, the department will start looking at taking action against those not meeting standards. He wouldn’t say which centres were on his priority list for taking action, but flagged he’d soon have more to say. He said today: The intention here is not for centres to close but for centres to raise their standards to meet the quality and safety standards that we expect them to have. But it’s not an idle threat … I think parents will want to know if their centres are not up to scratch. And that’s why, as part of this legislation, we’re saying that, if my department imposes a condition on a centre and says, “You’ve got this time to get up to scratch,” they have to tell the parents at that centre what’s happening as well so they’ve got the information they need to make the decisions they need to make, to make sure their children are getting the best-quality care and education they can. Clare said he wouldn’t go into the priority list today, but that he’d told the department “to be ready to act swiftly.” “I’ll have more to say next week,” the minister said. Ninety six homeless Queenslanders banned from emergency accommodation under crackdown Ninety six homeless Queenslanders have been banned from emergency accommodation for six months within the first two months of a new crackdown. Mark Cridland, director general for Queensland’s Department of Housing and Public, revealed just under 4,000 people were currently living in a hotel or motel paid for by the department under its ‘immediate housing response’ scheme. Of the 96 people evicted under a new policy implemented in May, 59% had been evicted as a result of bad behaviour or a breach of hotel rules, he said. He added no people had yet been banned from both social housing and emergency accommodation, under the government’s new three-strike policy. Four “first and final notices were issued for dangerous and severe behaviors” have been issued since the policy came into effect in July, according to housing and public works minister, Sam O’Connor. How office buildings, factories and shopping centres can cause legionnaires’ outbreaks Following from the news of a legionnaires’ disease outbreak that has seen one man die and six others hospitalised, Guardian Australia’s Matilda Boseley is here to explain what the infection is and how legionella bacteria spreads: Elon Musk’s X has lost a full federal court appeal where the company tried to claim that a notice issued to Twitter over its tackling of child sexual abuse material did not account for the company “ceasing to exist” when X Corp merged with Twitter in March 2023. X had challenged whether the notice could have been issued in the first place because it was first brought against Twitter prior to the company becoming X. The full federal court dismissed the appeal, with costs, with the judgment noting that between the notice being issued to Twitter and X being fined, eSafety continued to engage with representatives of the company, and it wasn’t clear what issuing a fresh notice to X would have changed. The judgment stated the challenge “has no substantive merit” X and eSafety were approached for comment. X has several concurrent court cases running against eSafety. The X loss today means, barring a high court appeal, the case eSafety brought in the federal court seeking an fine of up to $610,500 can now proceed. • A previous version of this post stated that the merits of the notice were to be decided in a separate administrative review tribunal case. This was incorrect, as that case is related to a separate notice also related to the company’s handling of terror content on its platform. A man in his 80s has died as health authorities investigate an outbreak of legionnaires’ disease in a harbourside Sydney suburb. Another six Potts Point residents have been hospitalised with the infection since late May, one of whom is yet to return home. None of the patients are known to each other, though they may have become infected after exposure to a common source, according to South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (SESLHD). Water sources in the areas visited by the seven locals are being tested for potential contamination as health authorities and the City of Sydney seek to determine the source of the outbreak. Investigation are yet to find legionella bacteria but authorities have asked building owners to disinfect their cooling towers on two occasions since the investigation began in June, SESHLD’s public health unit director, Dr Vicky Sheppeard, said. She added: People who have recently been in Potts Point and develop these symptoms should see their GP or go to a hospital emergency department. Outbreaks can occur after contamination of bacteria from cooling towers on large buildings or other environmental sources, Sheppeard said. Legionnaires’ disease is not normally spread from person to person. The disease is a form of pneumonia, or lung infection, caused by legionella bacteria. The bacteria can be found in damp environments and, in Australia, the two most common types are found in water and soil. You can read more about the disease here: Education ministers to meet in August to discuss ‘key questions’ relating to childcare centre CCTV The issue of CCTV will be discussed at the next meeting of state, territory and federal education ministers. Clare says there are key questions on how that data will be used or stored, which will be addressed at that meeting in August. The last thing you want to do here is create a honey pot for bad people. So where does the [CCTV] data get stored? How does it get used? I’m on the record saying that I think it has real value in potentially deterring bad people from doing bad things. I think it also has real value for police in being able to use that in their investigations. That’s after – after the fact, though. If it can deter, that’s good. Asked about the Hecs legislation, and the push from the Greens to go further to wipe Hecs debt completely, Clare says it’s not just a one-off cut, and the reforms change the structure of how the debt is paid back for all students. The legislation increases the salary threshold for those paying student debts back, meaning graduates on lower salaries won’t have to begin paying their debt back until later, or will pay back less until they earn more. Instead of paying back around about $1,900 once they hit $70,000, it’s about $450 … When you’re on $70,000 and might be renting, that money matters, that money counts. That helps you to pay for rent, pay for food, pay for public transport. This was a recommendation of the Accord. It was a recommendation of a bloke named Bruce Chapman who for those who don’t know was the architect of Hecs back in the ‘80s. And he says that this is perhaps the most important change to the Hecs system in 35 years. ‘There is a mountain of work to do’ to fix childcare: Clare Clare says again that this legislation is only the start of reforms that governments – federal, state and territory – need to do to fix the system. The impact of the legislation, Clare says, should be to raise the standards of centres, not to force them shut, at a time when the government is also trying to boost the number of children accessing early childhood education. Clare says there’s already a list of providers prepared, that the government could take action against – but he won’t yet reveal who’s on it. I won’t expand on that today. I will have more to say on that when the department publishes that list. First, the bill needs to pass the parliament, then it needs to receive royal assent. But I have directed my department to be ready to act swiftly. I’ll have more to say next week. Hecs cut ‘promised and delivered’ says education minister The education minister, Jason Clare, is speaking to the media, after the passing of the government’s Hecs bill through the Senate. We promised it and we’ve delivered. Young Australians don’t always see something for them on the ballot paper, but they did this year. Clare says the debt relief will be backdated to 1 June this year, before indexation was applied. He also says he’s hopeful the childcare legislation will be passed in the Senate before question time today. Here’s a video of Lidia Thorpe moving the motion earlier this morning: Thorpe urges PM to use Garma festival speech to commit to deaths in custody royal commission recommendations Independent senator Lidia Thorpe has called on Anthony Albanese to use his speech at the Garma festival to implement the recommendations of the deaths in custody royal commission. Albanese will travel to the Northern Territory this weekend for the important Indigenous cultural and community festival. He will make a speech at the event, which is often where federal leaders commit to new policy and stances in Indigenous affairs. Speaking after her motion on deaths in custody was passed by the Senate, Thorpe told a press conference that she hoped Albanese would use Garma to commit to taking more federal action on hanging points and other concerns in prisons. No one’s had oversight of those recommendations for two decades, since the demise of Atsic. They’ve been sitting there for two decades. No one gave a damn that deaths in custody was still happening, so oversight and action on implementing the remainder of those recommendations, removing hanging points would be great. We know that there’s been hanging points that have been used 20 times. The prisons know. The cops know. The governments know, yet they allow people to continue to take their lives in known hanging points. A recommendation from the royal commission is to remove them, to provide mental health services, to allow communities to self determine their own solutions. So it’d be great if the prime minister took it seriously and not just rock up [to Garma] to see culture on display. The government’s Hecs debt bill has passed parliament, a key promise of the federal election. The Greens tried to move several amendments to the bill, but the government wouldn’t support them. Ultimately the bill passed without amendments – it’s the first bill to pass in the new term – supported by Labor, the Greens, independents including David Pocock, Tammy Tyrrell and Fatima Payman. Coalition senators abstained from voting, and three One Nation senators voted against the bill. Lidia Thorpe introducing her motion into the Senate this morning Thorpe’s motion expressed sympathies to the families of the 17 First Nations people who have died in custody this year, including 24-year-old Walpiri man Kumanjayi White, and to the families of the 602 Indigenous deaths in custody since the release of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. The motion was supported by Labor and the Greens. RBA deputy governor says consumer price figures ‘very welcome’ The Reserve Bank’s deputy governor, Andrew Hauser, says yesterday’s consumer price figures were “very welcome”, in a further signal that the central bank has gained some comfort with the trajectory of inflation and that it will cut rates next month. Inflation dropped to 2.1% in the year to June, while the RBA’s preferred underlying measure fell to 2.7% - which Hauser said was in line with the bank’s forecasts. Still, Hauser also flagged that the central bank was in no rush. Our strategy for some time is to set interest rates to bring inflation back sustainably – that’s an important word – to the midpoint of the 2-3% target range, and to do that through a policy that is gradual, considered, measured. Financial markets are pricing in a rate cut on 12 August and another by the November board meeting. Jim Chalmers on morning TV refused to comment on likelihood of a rate cut next month. I try not to make predictions about decisions that the independent Reserve Bank will take about interest rates, but I’m really pleased that inflation has come down so substantially. It’s a powerful demonstration of the progress that Australians have made together in the fight against inflation. Labor votes against Greens amendment to early childhood bill The Senate has now moved to the early childhood bill the government has said it wants to be passed this week (ie today). The Greens are trying to move an amendment to the bill that would note “the need for broader reform” to make early childhood education universal, and calls on the government to establish an independent national Early Childhood Education and Care Commission. Labor votes against it with a handful of Liberal senators. They’ll now continue debating – the minister, Jess Walsh, is currently answering questions on the bill in the chamber – before they vote on the bill. Lidia Thorpe’s condolence motion passes in Senate Lidia Thorpe’s condolence motion extending its sympathies to the families of the 17 First Nations people who have died in custody this year, including 24-year-old Walpiri man Kumanjayi White, who died in May after being restrained by officers at an Alice Springs supermarket, has passed in the Senate. Tears as Marion Scrymgour says deaths in custody ‘catastrophic for my communities’ The Labor member for Lingiari, in the Northern Territory, Marion Scrymgour, is tearing up in the chamber, as she also speaks on Aboriginal deaths in custody. She says two of the First Nations people who have died in custody this year have been from the area that she represents. This issue weighs heavily on me. As an Aboriginal person from the Northern Territory, these deaths have been catastrophic for my communities. As a mother, as a grandmother, these deaths have weighed heavily on my communities. I hear their calls for justice, Speaker. After Kumanjayi Walker’s tragic passing in Alice Springs during Naidoc, I called for the investigation with minister McCarthy to look into his death and to have suitably qualified and authorised professionals from outside the Northern Territory police. We didn’t take that decision lightly, we did it because of the systemic racism and the issues between our Northern Territory police and Aboriginal people. Murray Watt says rate of Indigenous deaths in custody ‘unacceptable’ Both houses are speaking on Indigenous deaths in custody this morning. After Thorpe, Murray Watt says it is “simply unacceptable that 602 First Nations people have died in custody since the 1991 royal commission”. In the House, Amanda Rishworth is speaking on behalf of Malarndirri McCarthy: The royal commission was clear that the best way to reduce Indigenous deaths in custody is to reduce the high incarceration rate of First Nations people, including through social and economic responses. This is what the commonwealth government is focusing on. McCarthy told RN Breakfast this morning that justice and preventing mass incarceration of adults and young First Nations people is a key focus of the government. Independent senator Lidia Thorpe has put forward a motion in the Senate this morning, extending sympathies to the families of the 17 First Nations people who have died in custody this year, including 24-year-old Walpiri man Kumanjayi White who died in May after being restrained by officers at an Alice Springs supermarket. Labor and the Greens have agreed to pass the motion acknowledging White’s death while extending its sympathies to the families of the 602 Indigenous deaths in custody since the release of the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The motion also called on all parliamentarians to work constructively together to address the over-incarceration and deaths of First Nations people in custody. While moving the motion, Thorpe said: These are not just statistics. They are sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, cousins, siblings, grandchildren – lost to a system that continues to harm our people ... This motion is about preventing that pain from continuing. It’s about doing what we can, here and now, to ensure that Kumanjayi’s death is not just another entry in a long and shameful list. It must be a turning point. Thorpe also spoke of the impact on her family after the death of her cousin, Joshua Kerr, a 32-year-old Yorta Yorta and Gunaikurnai man who died in custody in August 2022. The motion this morning coincides with the release of the latest Closing the Gap report, which revealed only four of 19 targets were on track to be met by 2031. The 2023-24 data showed the national rate of Indigenous youths in detention had increased compared with the previous year. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is holding a press conference at West Melbourne police station before a statewide machete ban coming into effect. From 1 September, owning, carrying, using, buying or selling a machete without a valid exemption or approval will be a criminal offence in Victoria. The state is the first in Australia to impose a ban and it follows a similar move in the UK. Allan says there will be an amnesty period until 30 November and announced the location of more than 40 safe disposal bins that will be available 24/7 at police stations across Victoria to allow people to safely dispose of machetes. Machetes destroy lives and there is no place for them on Victorian streets. That’s why we’ve already moved to bring about the ban on the sale of machetes – and that ban on the sale of machetes is working. We’ve already seen machetes not just being taken off the shelves of retail stores, they’re also been taken offline as well. Amazon has stopped putting machetes for sale online for the entire nation. Wiggles share post featuring Wags the Dog dressed in black after Anika Wells’ ‘black skivvies’ remark The Wiggles have another cheeky nod to the communications minister, Anika Wells, referring to the bosses at Wiggles HQ as wearing “black skivvies” in a post promoting the children’s group’s latest tour. Wells said yesterday she was lobbied against including YouTube in the under 16s social media ban not by individual Wiggles, but “it was the black skivvies, it was Wiggles Inc, it was Wiggles management”. Wiggles HQ already fired back saying they don’t wear black skivvies, but in the promo video posted on Thursday it features Wags the Dog in Wiggles HQ dressed in black. The group said it was “Big Wiggles” news. Guardian Australia reported yesterday a planned Google event in Parliament House was cancelled last night after the ban was announced. Google said it was “out of respect for the grieving families” at Parliament House who were there representing their children who had lost their lives as a result of issues such as bullying on social media. Queensland government ‘buried’ pill-testing report The operators of Queensland’s former pill-testing scheme have claimed the state government has “buried” a report into the now-cancelled program. The Loop Australia submitted an RTI request for the documents but was denied on the basis that they may be considered by cabinet. The state government closed both testing sites in April this year, a year after it opened. About 700 people used the service during that time, according to the Loop Australia. The Loop’s chief executive, Cameron Francis, said there would be “increases in overdose deaths in the community” as a result of the decision. This service saved lives, reduced harm and linked people into vital health supports. Pill-testing provides a doorway into the health system. We connect with people who have previously been reluctant to engage with the health system. Greens say Australia should recognise Palestinian state The Greens say Australia should join with the other nations in moving to recognise a Palestinian state, including France, as well as the UK and Canada, both who have conditions to that recognition. Sarah Hanson-Young told Sky News this morning Australia should follow our allies but wouldn’t say whether that should be at the United Nations General Assembly in September. I think it is a matter of time, but we’re also running out of time because people are dying, and I wouldn’t want to see this just get caught up in some kind of diplomatic, bureaucratic process … It’s time to end the illegal occupation of Gaza, to have to get aid into Gaza so that people can eat and have clean water, and we also need to recognise the state of Palestine. The sooner Australia can lift our diplomatic voices and join with other countries in sending a very strong message … Whatever Australia can do, we should be doing. The Greens have also been calling for more sanctions on Israel. The deputy Nationals leader, Kevin Hogan, sitting on the Sky News panel with Hanson-Young, says there shouldn’t be a timeline for recognising Palestine. I certainly understand the will of recognising a Palestinian state. But who right now would you do that with? There’s a peace proposal on the table at the moment from Israel, but Hamas won’t accept that. They are a terrorist organisation. You cannot deal with a terrorist organisation. I hope they [the government] don’t put a timeline on it, in the sense there happens to be a meeting in September, so that’s when they do it. That is not the right way to do this. Malarndirri McCarthy says more work needed to reduce Indigenous incarceration The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, says she’s concerned about the number of young First Nations people in prisons. In the Northern Territory, which McCarthy represents in the Senate, the Territory government has been defending a controversial plan to reinstate spit hoods in it’s youth detention centres, a decade after they were banned. Youth justice is one of the areas where there’s been no improvement, according to the latest Closing the Gap data. McCarthy told RN Breakfast a bit earlier this morning that there are prisons in Alice Springs where nearly 50% of prisoners are on remand, where young people are in overcrowded watch houses while they are going through the court process. It’s really tough when you have states who are focused on youth, in particular with the incarceration of young, Indigenous youth, certainly in the high rates of Indigenous people across here in the Northern Territory. Why is it that we see so many young people before the courts who are in watch houses, who are in overcrowding? Even the corrections staff have told me this, the police association of the Northern Territory has told me this. These are really worrying trends we see. McCarthy says justice is an area the government is “pursuing vigorously” to improve but also says the areas that are improving are “heartening to see”. Details of PM and Keir Starmer’s phone call revealed The prime minister spoke to his UK counterpart, Keir Starmer, last night, to discuss the war in Gaza. We’ve received a read out of the phone call, which states “the leaders agreed on the importance of using the international momentum to secure a ceasefire, the release of all hostages and the acceleration of aid, as well as ensuring Hamas did not play a role in a future state”. Albanese said during his press conference yesterday that he’d already spoken to Starmer before he announced that the UK would move to recognise a Palestinian state. In the latest call, the leaders also discussed Aukus and “welcomed the progress being made by all partners”. James Paterson says recognising Palestinian statehood would ‘lose all leverage over the Palestinian Authority’ The shadow finance minister, James Paterson, says recognising Palestine today would mean recognising a state “which is in part governed by a terrorist organisation”. Paterson says Hamas has shown “no interest” in demilitarising or returning hostages – two key conditions held by the Australian government. Canada is the latest country to declare its intention to recognise Palestinian statehood, after the UK and France. Paterson tells Sky News Australia shouldn’t follow based on an “artificial measure of momentum”. We should only recognise that Palestinian state after peace has been agreed and achieved, because otherwise you lose all leverage over the Palestinian Authority. They desperately want to achieve this international recognition, and they would be willing to do some things in exchange for that, including forswearing their desire to destroy the State of Israel in exchange for it. But if you hand over that recognition, you have no further leverage to expect them to negotiate over. Yesterday, Labor MP Ed Husic said momentum in Australia is building and that Hamas is “built largely on grievance”, which he said would be removed with the establishment of a Palestinian state. This morning, Canada has announced that it plans to recognise a Palestinian state, putting more pressure on Australia to do the same. The Australian government has said it’s a matter of “when, not if” a Palestinian state is recognised, but Canada joins key allies planning to do it by September at the UN General Assembly. In a statement, Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, says prospects for a two-state solution have been “steadily and gravely eroded” by the “pervasive threat of Hamas terrorism and its “violent rejection of Israel’s right to exist”, the accelerated settlement building by Israelis and settler violence, and the “ongoing failure by the Israeli government to prevent the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian disaster in Gaza”. Carney says the plan is conditional, and predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to reforms including: The commitments by Palestinian Authority president Abbas to fundamentally reform its governance, to hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarise the Palestinian state. Canada will increase its efforts in supporting strong, democratic governance in Palestine and the contributions of its people to a more peaceful and hopeful future. Jim Chalmers says delay in US sending new ambassador ‘not unusual’ Moving on to the Today Show, Chalmers is facing more questions about the relationship between the US and Australia. There are a few elements to it this morning – there’s the tariff situation, the delay in the Aukus review (which the administration announced yesterday would be completed this spring, outside the original 30-day timeline), and the fact that the US hasn’t sent over a new ambassador to Australia. It’s not super uncommon for the charges d’affaires (the second in charge in an embassy) to be the No 1 in charge for a while until an ambassador is selected. Under the last Trump administration, Donald Trump took two years to appoint veteran Republican lawyer Arthur B Culvahouse Jr to the role – and it took another couple of months on top of that for the US Senate to approve him. Chalmers says it’s “not unusual” for countries to take time to appoint an ambassador, and that “it hasn’t prevented us from working closely with the Americans”. He rejects the assertion that there’s a lot of “uncertainty” in the relationship and also says it’s “not unusual” for the new government to review the Aukus deal. Well, I’m not sure about that. I think that might be overdoing it but, more broadly, there’s a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. We’re seeing that play out. Tariffs are part of that. National security considerations are part of that as well. Anika Wells on social media ban: ‘We can’t police the ocean, but we can police the sharks’ The communications minister has explained the government is restricting children’s YouTube access instead of targeting social media companies’ responsibilities with an analogy that while it is impossible to police the ocean, they are “going to have a crack” at policing the sharks. Anika Wells appeared on ABC’s 7.30 program yesterday evening after news this week that children will be banned from having YouTube accounts from December, with the federal government backflipping on an earlier decision to exempt the video platform from the national under-16s social media restrictions. In response to being asked if the bigger question was not why social media companies are putting vile material on their platforms in the first place, Wells said: It is a question for the social media platforms. YouTube uploads 500 hours of content every 60 seconds. If you could put all of that social media content in a library, it would be the world’s worst library. You wouldn’t allow your child to walk into it, but the internet is here. The internet is ubiquitous. I’ve got little kids. We are all trying our best. Parents are trying their best, but it is like trying to teach your kids to swim in an open ocean with rips and sharks rather than at the pool. We can’t police the ocean, but we can police the sharks. We’re going to have a crack at it. Wells said the government remains committed to a plan that will also see legal responsibility put on social media companies to prevent harmful content on their platforms. On to international issues, Chalmers is asked whether Australia could recognise a Palestinian state by September for the UN meeting – as the UK said it will do, unless Israel takes “substantive steps” to end the conflict and commit to a peace process. Chalmers says he won’t put a timeframe on it but it’s “a matter of when, not if” – echoing comments made by both the prime minister and other ministers yesterday. There are a number of obstacles still in the way to recognition of a Palestinian state. For example, the treatment, the release of the hostages, making sure that there’s absolutely no role for Hamas. These are the sorts of things that the international community is working through. But that statement that came out yesterday that we signed as Australians via our foreign minister, Penny Wong, is a really important one. Chalmers is also asked about the tariff situation and says the government hasn’t “heard any different from the 10% baseline that’s been levied on Australia”. Donald Trump has said this week more countries could be levied at 15% to 20%. Chalmers won’t rule out Australia being hit with a higher rate. I think it would be a brave person to assume that there won’t be, whether it’s with other countries or – there will always be more announcements about this. These tariff announcements are a moving feast. But our expectation is we get the baseline. Jim Chalmers says Australia ‘needs to do much better’ on Closing the Gap Jim Chalmers starts on ABC News Breakfast this morning. He’s pretty happy with the inflation numbers and says the first two rate cuts this year were “very, very welcome” relief, but he won’t predict if there’ll be another. Asked about the latest Closing the Gap data, Chalmers says Australia “needs to do much better” and that some outcomes have gone backwards in “worrying ways”. Minister Malarndirri McCarthy is working in her characteristically diligent way with all of the stakeholders, all of the communities, to try to turn these numbers around. There has been progress in 10 of the 15. There has been some worrying outcomes in the rest, but overall, we need to do more and we need to do better. McCarthy and the prime minister will be visiting the Garma festival this weekend, held in remote north-east Arnhem Land. Good morning, Krishani Dhanji here with you for the final sitting day of the fortnight, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us started! Jim Chalmers is doing the media rounds this morning, off the back of what he called “outstanding” inflation data yesterday. The government has said it wants its childcare bill to be passed through parliament this week, which leaves today for it to be voted through the Senate (it has the support of the Coalition and the Greens). And as Martin brought you earlier, we’ll be following the reaction to the latest Closing the Gap data. Stay with us, it’s going to be a big one! Closing the Gap review finds community controlled organisations key to progress The new data follows a recent review of the Closing the Gap agreement, commissioned by the Coalition of Peaks. The review found Indigenous community controlled organisations are key to progress, and governments must listen to First Nations people and share decision-making power to create positive change. Productivity commissioner Selwyn Button said the review shows the outcomes of the agreement are falling well short of what governments have committed to. What the outcomes in the agreement reflect most of all is the limited progress of governments in collectively acting on the priority reforms: sharing decision-making and data with communities; strengthening the Aboriginal community controlled sector and changing the way governments operate. Coalition of Peaks Lead Convenor Pat Turner said improvements in early education enrolments, employment and land and sea rights show what’s possible when government partner with Indigenous organisations “in the right way”. But she said when governments fail to meet their commitments to work with community controlled organisations the gap widens. What’s important for Australians to understand is that Aboriginal community controlled organisations are not fringe services. We’re not asking for special treatment. We’re asking for a fair share. When we get that, we deliver. These are the Closing the Gap socioeconomic outcomes in the latest report in detail: 89.2% of babies were born with a healthy birthweight (improvement, but not on track) 94.2% of children were enrolled in preschool (on track) 33.9% of children commencing school were developmentally on track (worsening) 2,304 out of every 100,000 adults were in prison (worsening) 26 out of every 10,000 young people were in detention (no change) 50 out of every 1,000 children were in out-of-home care (worsening) 31 out of every 100,000 people took their own life (worsening) 4.3 million sq km of land were subject to Indigenous rights or interests (on track) 113,517 sq km of sea were subject to Indigenous rights or interests (on track) 88% of people used the internet (no assessment) Closing the Gap results ‘unacceptable’ “It’s not enough to hope the gap will close, governments must hold themselves to account for the commitments they’ve made under the national agreement,” Coalition of Peaks lead convener Pat Turner said of the latest Closing the Gap report. “That requires smart investment, longer-term flexible funding and full implementation of the four priority reforms – shifting power, not just policy. “Without real power shift, we’ll keep seeing the same patterns repeat, and our people will continue to pay the price.” The Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council chief executive, Paula Arnol, said the latest Closing the Gap report card was disappointing. “It’s 2025 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are still not experiencing the health outcomes that non-Indigenous Australians enjoy. This is unacceptable,” she said. Without changing the approach to Closing the Gap, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will continue to “pay the price”, Indigenous organisations say. Just four of the 19 Closing the Gap targets are on track to be met, according to the latest data from the Productivity Commission, Australian Associated Press reports. But key targets, including adult imprisonment rates, children in out-of-home care, suicide and childhood development, are continuing to worsen. While there have been improvements in year 12 attainment, tertiary education and housing access, these are not on track to meet deadlines. Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it will be Krishani Dhanji with the main action. The latest Closing the Gap report has been released this morning and it shows that progress is being made on only four of the 19 targets. Indigenous groups and advocates say governments need to do more. More details coming up. Anika Wells, the communications minister, appeared on 7.30 last night to explain the government’s decision to restrict children’s YouTube access. More details coming up on that as well.
