  patriotic Prom

  In one sense, this stroll along the highways and byways of 20th-century
  British music was a throwback to an earlier era when Proms audiences were
  treated to grab bags of the latest popular odds and sods. What made this such
  a stimulating affair was the juxtaposition of undeniable old masters with
  works by composers underrepresented in today’s concert halls. With the BBC
  National Orchestra of Wales on top form throughout, helmed by the energetic
  Italian-Turkish conductor Nil Venditti, there was much here to relish. The
  staples first, and Vaughan Williams’s The Lark Ascending received a poetic and
  thoroughly idiomatic reading at the hands of Bulgarian violinist Liya Petrova.
  The orchestra laid the velvet-cushioned groundwork over which Petrova soared
  with elegant phrasing, silvery tone and exquisitely delivered top notes. An
  assured account of Britten’s Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes teemed with
  atmosphere. Venditti was particularly adept at bringing out the music’s
  underlying menace, though the hectic pace adopted for the Sunday Morning bells
  episode left musical details muddied by the acoustic. If Walton’s Crown
  Imperial, taken a tad fast, lacked the final ounce of Technicolor chutzpah,
  Elgar’s Enigma Variations was a painterly tour de force, Venditti holding the
  architectural line despite twice being interrupted by overeager applause.
  Tempi were ideal, whether depicting the aquatic high jinks of a bulldog in a
  river or sustaining a breathtakingly controlled build through Nimrod. The
  rarities – all Proms premieres – were a fascinating if slightly mixed bag.
  William Mathias’s syncopated Dance Overture was a proper crowd-pleaser, the
  wizardly Welsh composer successfully locating his inner Carmen Miranda. The
  BBC Singers lent class to a pair of Edwardian part-songs by Samuel
  Coleridge-Taylor, while his daughter Avril’s The Shepherd, a haunting setting
  of William Blake for male voices and strings, was a fine discovery. Both
  rather showed up John Rutter’s sugar-coated Bird Songs, here receiving its
  world premiere. Schmaltzy and curiously derivative, they felt dated in a way
  the older music did not. It was left to Venditti to right the ship with Grace
  Williams’ affecting Elegy for Strings, its gently rocking rhythms and
  intricate interweaving lines crowned by Lesley Hatfield’s heartfelt violin
  solo. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue until
  13 September
