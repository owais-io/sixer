  Dealing with the unprecedented threats from Donald Trump’s threats to Canada’s
  economy and sovereignty have required unconventional strategies from federal
  and provincial leaders, including barring liquor sales and cancelling
  contracts with Tesla. But among the more unorthodox strategies to hit back
  against the US is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on novelty hats.
  In January, sensing a marketing opportunity after Trump threatened to annex
  Canada, an Ottawa-based company began selling hats with the message “Canada is
  not for sale” in capital letters. Days later, Ontario premier Doug Ford – a
  blunt-spoken, burly populist with a knack for politics – entered a high-stakes
  meeting with other premiers and the prime minister wearing the hat. The move
  kicked off a frenzy of online orders and created a rare moment of political
  consensus. But Ford’s love of the hat cost his party nearly C$300,000
  (US$218,000), according to reporting by the Trillium. According to newly
  disclosed public election finance filings, the Progressive Conservative party
  of Ontario paid C$278,910.71 to Jackpine Dynamic Branding, the company
  producing the viral hats, during the province’s election campaign period last
  spring. The party also transferred more than 600 hats – bought for C$23.19
  each before the election – to the campaign, according to the Trillium. Liam
  Mooney, who runs Jackpine Dynamic Branding with his fiancée, Emma Cochrane,
  previously told the Guardian the couple wanted a simple but firm message with
  the hat. “It was a small act of patriotism to respond to these big threats and
  this big bluster,” Mooney said. Their online store, which sold red and navy
  blue headwear featuring the wording “Strong and Free” and “Canada Is Not For
  Sale”, as well as “Fort et libre” and “Le Canada n’est pas à vendre”, was
  quickly overwhelmed with traffic. The couple ended up selling tens of
  thousands of the hats, which they eventually managed to produce in Canada
  after weeks of manufacturing headaches. Ford and campaign surrogates also wore
  the hat often during the provincial election in February, in which his
  government won in a rare, third majority mandate.
