  racing in Taiwan

  There’s almost nothing some handlers won’t do to win. Competitors have been
  kidnapped and then offered up for ransom. Others have reportedly been smuggled
  on to high-speed trains to get to the finish line first. Some are said to be
  kept hungry so that they move quicker on race day. This is the fast and
  furious world of pigeon racing in Taiwan. The sport is globally popular and
  centuries old, but few scenes are as bizarre as Taiwan’s, where the stakes are
  high and no scheme is too complex or crafty for some. But members want things
  to change. Wu Chung-ming is chair of the national pigeon racing body and his
  local racing association. His desk is adorned with a kitschy pigeon-shaped
  ashtray, near a computer mining “Pigeoncoin” cryptocurrency. Parked outside is
  the Tesla he bought specifically for its gull-winged doors. “At first, I
  wasn’t particularly into it,” he tells the Guardian. “But once I started
  getting involved, I met all these really passionate people who were crazy
  about the sport.” Wu is among members calling for regulation to address the
  shady sides of the sport and make it easier for rule-abiding competitors to
  compete cleanly and safely. Taiwanese pigeon racing originated during Japanese
  colonial rule a century ago, later evolving into a pastime among working-class
  people from outside the cities. Animals rights groups want to see pigeon
  racing banned while acknowledging it is deeply embedded in Taiwanese society
  It is now one of the world’s largest with about 200,000 breeder-trainers and
  countless investors, across about 80 regional clubs racing up to a million
  birds a year. While the demographics mostly stayed the same, it has grown into
  a multimillion-dollar competitive industry, with official prize pools that can
  exceed NTD$30m (US$1m) a season. But it sits in a legal grey area. “If it’s
  illegal, then please shut us all down as soon as possible,” Wu says. “But if
  it’s legal, then shouldn’t there be some policies in place to support us?” The
  chaotic combination of low regulation and lots of cash has led to
  extraordinary behaviour, including the high-speed rail stunt and what Wu says
  is a common scheme – cloning tracking chips to send a secret second bird over
  the finish line early. There are also methods that would probably be banned if
  a solid set of standards were established, such as the use of performance
  enhancing drugs, and trainers who separate their racing birds from its
  lifelong mate so it races home faster. Some trainers will even put a pigeon’s
  mate in a separate cage with another bird hoping the jealousy will fire up the
  racer’s wings. “Running a pigeon club in Taiwan is honestly tough, because
  there’s so much cheating,” says Wu. “There were all kinds of tricks – I’ve
  heard a lot of them.” Wu says he’s willing to work with welfare groups and the
  government to create “a healthier form of the sport”, brought out of the grey
  area, but the government has left them “stuck in limbo”. The government claims
  pigeon racing is linked to too much crime. As well as the cheating and
  kidnapping, there are also alleged ties in some cases to criminal gangs,
  accusations of animal cruelty and reports of billions of Taiwanese dollars in
  potentially illegal side-betting that total far more than the official prize
  pools. In other counties, Taiwanese police raid what they say are illegal
  betting rings operating out of local associations. Officials have been
  arrested or jailed and hundreds of millions of Taiwan dollars seized.
  “Gambling offences have long been a key enforcement target,” Taiwan’s ministry
  of interior told the Guardian, while the ministry of agriculture claimed
  illegal gambling was the industry’s “main source of revenue”. ‘Very
  competitive’ sport: at the summer sea race check-in Wu told the Guardian that
  his association does nothing illegal, and argues that the unofficial prize
  pools are not illegal. “What we do in pigeon racing is not gambling, it’s a
  competition prize. The government has never really given us a clear stance on
  it.” Kidnappings and ransoms The industry has tried to address the cheating.
  In the late 1990s all Taiwanese pigeon races were moved offshore, packing tens
  of thousands of birds on to container ships to fly a route almost entirely
  over the open ocean. But the format has been condemned by animal rights
  groups, which claim that huge numbers of pigeons are lost at sea, in races
  that appear to go ahead no matter the weather. Authorities say loss rates in
  some races are as high as 98%. The national pigeon racing body will register
  about 60% of birds returning home by season’s end The rights groups allege
  birds are often mistreated, and cruelly discarded once past their prime. Some
  want racing banned outright. But He Tsung-hsun, secretary general of the
  Taiwan Animal Protection Monitoring Network, (TAPMN) acknowledges the “culture
  is deeply embedded in Taiwanese society” and instead urges authorities to
  start with a ban on sea races and to better investigate allegations of illegal
  activity. Wu says of the mistreatment and theft allegations: “that kind of
  behaviour is terrible to us too. We want to fix that. I want to talk to these
  groups and say, ‘OK, if we go back to land-based races where fewer birds get
  lost or hurt, I’m all for it’.” Huang Nai-shun at his pigeon coop in Yunlin.
  His love of the sport takes every spare dollar he has, he says Pigeon racers
  say the loss figures misinterpret late finishers as dying or disappearing. At
  season’s end, Wu’s association will register about 60% of birds returning
  home. Handlers say improving animal welfare is a key argument for further
  regulation of the sport. “If races can be kept fair and clean, with no
  cheating and no shady characters, we wouldn’t necessarily have to rely on sea
  races,” says Huang Nai-shun, a pigeon breeder and racer. Huang decries the
  impact that crime and a lack of regulation has had on the sport. He says he
  has had to pay many a ransom to kidnappers for his own pigeons, and is
  distressed by the lack of standards for how to treat or dispose of those no
  longer racing. “Wherever there’s a competition, there will always be people
  trying to game the system,” he says. Inside his rooftop pigeon loft in Chiayi
  county, Huang tends his pigeons with affection. He says the racing season
  takes every spare dollar as well as months of early mornings and late nights
  for training flights. “It’s tough,” he says. “It’s all down to what you love –
  people only do this if they truly enjoy it.” Taiwanese pigeon-racing
  originated during Japanese colonial rule a century ago The path to legitimacy
  It’s the last weekend of the southern competition’s summer season and Wu is
  overseeing the pre-race check-in at a nearby warehouse. Even in the pouring
  rain there’s an air of excitement as a stream of mostly older men arrive
  carrying cages of racing pigeons for check-in. Pigeon breeder Lin Yo-zhen, 29,
  is one of the few people under 40 entering the southern sea summer race Race
  officials scan trackers and wave UV lights over wings for invisible markings.
  The birds are separated from their owners and strictly guarded, then loaded
  into a container to be sent offshore with dozens of others the next day. The
  handlers who speak to the Guardian push back on the criticism of their sport,
  and the Guardian is not suggesting that any of them are involved in illegal
  activity. For them, it’s not about the prize money, which they say they rarely
  see themselves, it’s about the thrill of the race and the payoff for hard
  work. “It feels like training your own Olympic athletes,” says 29-year-old Lin
  Yo-Chen, one of the few people under 40, registering his last three competing
  birds. He loves “everything” about the sport, he says, noting that the other
  27 birds he raced this season are all safely back at home. Octogenerian Chen
  Bi-chou has been racing pigeons for seven decades. He is feeling optimistic
  about his last remaining racer but says he loves the sport for the community,
  and the tactical thinking that he believes helps keep dementia at bay. In two
  days, a livestream from the ship’s deck will show the birds blast out of their
  cages into the sea air and hopefully make a beeline for home. “You’ve put so
  much care into training them, and when you release them far away – sometimes
  in rough weather – and they still find their way home, it’s moving,” says Mr
  Tu, a 61-year-old retired prison guard. Chen Bi-chou, 81, has been breeding
  and racing pigeons for more than seven decades Eventually bird No 81 wins the
  season, its owner taking home official winnings of about NTD$1.2m ($40,000),
  from a pool of about NTD$6m. But data published by the association online
  reveals they also won more NTD$1m in side bets, from a total pool of NTD$148m.
  In other counties people have been convicted over side bets, but nationally,
  authorities are not clear on whether it is illegal. There is no record of any
  raids or arrests in Pingtung – Wu’s county. To legitimise the sport would
  require new legislation, the creation of a “competent authority”, strong
  industry self-regulation and an end to illegal gambling, the agriculture
  ministry says. However, there’s little sign of progress.
