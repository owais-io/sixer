  The moment I discovered both of my children had been sexually abused by our
  babysitter’s partner, I was hollowed out by the greatest sorrow I’d ever
  known. They were aged four and two. A stain bloomed backwards through time,
  through all the moments that once felt delightful and perfect: fat little
  hands catching the light, unsteady feet in tiny sneakers, sleeping faces. All
  those times I kissed their soft cheeks goodbye. Time collapsed in on itself.
  There was no before and after – just an after that swallowed everything. As
  their stories unfurled, in the aftermath of reporting them, I held my children
  with all the strength and protective love a mother can muster. I reassured
  them always: We believe you. This is not your fault. I am so sorry I wasn’t
  there. Years later, they carry no shame, and their childhood brims with joy. I
  am one parent among countless parents affected by child sexual abuse. As the
  silent guardian of my children’s stories, as their fierce advocate, I am bound
  to protect their privacy. Their stories belong to them. There are countless
  voiceless parents like me, siloed in trying to simultaneously support their
  children’s healing while quietly reassembling their shattered selves. For so
  many other kinds of traumas and sorrows we have a shared language, grief and
  ritual. We know secrets are corrosive, that healing deepens when we share our
  experience with others. Communal care is vital for our wellbeing. We know,
  too, especially as women, the power of refusing to stay silent. But what
  happens when these stories belong to our children? I was lucky to have the
  love of close friends, family and professional support, but most people in my
  world had no idea – and still have no idea – of our family’s quiet
  devastation. Living in a close-knit small community, I struggled to contain
  this seismic rupture during early motherhood. In the midst of playdates, trips
  to the park and music classes, the “how are yous?” were answered with chirpy
  falsities – I was suffocating under an unrelenting shame and guilt, wrenched
  with fury and sorrow. The ongoing senseless injustice. Aching sadness. I
  blamed myself entirely. Traumatic stress held me in its vice for months. The
  reminders were everywhere, unbidden memories surfacing. One Christmas, a man
  dressed as Santa visited our local gathering place. The children swarmed
  around him and I was overcome by an internal, shrieking anguish. Those big,
  big hands and all the small, trusting hands. I wept uncontrollably in the car
  park. I felt haunted, and desperately lonely. I thought of all the other
  parents – and think of them still. It has now been six years. The grief ebbs
  and flows. I now know the shame and guilt doesn’t belong to me. I have learned
  ways to manage the inner chaos of post-traumatic stress. I delight in my
  wonderful children’s strength, humour and curiosity. As an advocate to end
  child sexual abuse, I stand in solidarity with those seeking to address a
  legal system that continues to fail children. “Children do not and cannot lie
  about such things” is what we know and what we hear, over and over. This truth
  was validated for my children by the highest sexual assault recognition payout
  from Victims Services. Yet when children need to locate a date and time in
  their testimony, with no witnesses, no forensic evidence or a confession, it
  is nigh impossible for a perpetrator to be arrested – let alone convicted. My
  children’s disclosures tumbled out over months and years; words upon words of
  irrefutable evidence. I believe my children were able to tell me their stories
  because of all of our early conversations about bodily autonomy and not
  keeping secrets. Ongoing protective education programs are integral, and there
  needs to be more awareness of ill-founded, damaging stereotypes: there is no
  evidence to suggest that children who experience abuse will then go on to
  offend as adults. It is crucial we implement early-intervention measures for
  those at risk of harming children. Child sexual abuse is endemic: it happens
  in our communities, our homes, with people we often know and trust. Their
  actions are monstrous, but if we continue to deem them inhuman monsters, we
  are failing to address the problem where it begins: in ordinary places. These
  are difficult, complex, but necessary aspects of our ongoing national efforts
  to protect children. The effects of sexual abuse ricochet in so many
  directions. More trauma support is needed for those of us standing in its
  shadows: both families of abused children, and the devastated families of
  those who abuse. All trying to quietly support their children and rebuild
  their lives. • In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can
