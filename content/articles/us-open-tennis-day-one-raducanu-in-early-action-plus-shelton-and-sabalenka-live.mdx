  Shibahara’s first point of the match is set up by a tidy drop shot. She
  double-faults to make it 30-30, and does so again – a chance for Raducanu to
  break. Shibahara finds the net with a forehand and Raducanu goes 2-0 up. And
  we’re finally up and running, with Raducanu to serve. An ace is her first act
  of the tournament, and she’s rapid in going to 40-0, that first serve looking
  in good order. She’s up to the net as Shibahara is quickly overpowered.
  Raducanu leads 1-0 in the first set. Raducanu has played Shibahara before,
  beating her 6-1, 6-4 in Nottingham last year. Shibahara is best known for her
  work in doubles, having won the mixed event at the 2022 French Open. She did
  reach the second round of the singles here last year. If you fancy indulging
  in some nostalgia. Quick: tuck into Tumaini Carayol’s preview. Swiatek and
  Sinner lead the pack. Hello, hello, hello and welcome to the last slam of the
  season. We’ve had the flashier version of mixed doubles; now to the solo show,
  with the tournament enjoying its first Sunday start. Ben Shelton, Aryna
  Sabalenka and Taylor Fritz are among the big names ready to get going in the
  next few hours, but our early focus will be on the 2021 champion Emma
  Raducanu. She hasn’t won a match at Flushing Meadows since that life-changing
  triumph but is carrying some good vibes into this year’s draw; the world No 36
  pushed Sabalenka all the way to a third-set tiebreak in Cincinnati this month.
  She faces Japan’s Ena Shibahara at the Louis Armstrong Stadium at 4pm BST/11am
  local time. I’ll try keep my eye on everything, of course, but drop me a line
  with the things I’ll inevitably miss. Share your thoughts, hopes, fears,
  dreams, whatever compels you. Here’s to a fun couple of weeks.
