  handpicked to support Coldplay

  ‘When I say ‘Hull’, you say ‘City’! Hull …” Chiedu Oraka grins, pointing his
  mic towards the middle of a near-empty recording studio. Silence – for now, at
  least. Next week, that pause will be filled by 20,000 voices at Craven Park
  stadium, where the local rapper will open Coldplay’s latest UK run of Music of
  the Spheres tour dates. And he is determined to make that crowd his own.
  “There’s going to be people there who haven’t seen me before, so I want to
  give them everything – new songs, old ones and a party,” he says. “I’m proper
  buzzing for it.” Last year, Oraka played Glastonbury, opened for Skepta at
  South by Southwest and supported the Brit-award-winning rapper Casisdead. But
  these Coldplay shows are the 37-year-old’s biggest gigs yet – and Hull’s most
  high-profile music events in years. The gigs reflect Coldplay’s effort to
  reach working-class areas, while 10% of the proceeds from ticket sales will go
  to the Music Venue Trust, which protects grassroots venues. Chris Martin
  enlisting Oraka fulfils part of that ethos to uplift communities. “Chris
  FaceTimed me from his studio in LA and said: ‘I’m coming to your city. How can
  I help you?’” says Oraka. We are speaking at Yankee Land, a Hull fast food
  spot renowned for its chips. Oraka is a family friend who has been anointed
  with his own box meal: a giant burger with turkey bacon, fries, chilli cheese
  bites and popcorn chicken. Today, however, he has opted for a chicken burger,
  strips and a chocolate milkshake. “I was just brazen with it,” he continues.
  “Like: ‘Mate, I wanna support you on both shows.’” They announced the news on
  social media with a staged video call, in which Martin repeatedly butchered
  the pronunciation of Chiedu, before conceding that Coldplay would be, Oraka
  says, “closing the show for me”. The line was Martin’s idea; the
  mispronunciation gag came from earlier conversations, when the frontman
  struggled with his name. Over email, Martin keeps up the shtick: “I discovered
  Chiedu while learning about the music scene in Hull, and after we spoke a bit
  I asked him if he’d be open to us closing for him there. He took his time, but
  eventually agreed, as long as we don’t look him in the eye.” In Yankee Land,
  at least, the 6ft 7in (2-metre) star wears his homegrown celebrity status with
  warm humility. Staff repeatedly offer to replenish our spread of food. “Hey,
  Chie!” is followed by promises to text meet-up plans. “Everyone’s my best mate
  now,” he laughs, recalling the frenzy that followed the Coldplay news. “Like:
  ‘Oh, I knew he was always going to do it!’” Oraka was born and raised by a
  single mother on a council estate in north Hull and his identity is at the
  core of his artistry. They were the only Black family in the area; he grew up
  surrounded by white classmates who didn’t understand his Nigerian heritage.
  Racism was so entrenched that some of his friends hid from their parents the
  fact they were hanging out with a Black kid. “We were eating pounded yam and
  when my friends came over they were weirded out by it,” he says. “I was
  embarrassed. I just wanted to fit in.” He soon started getting into trouble.
  By 10, he was arrested for shoplifting; in 2007, he went to prison for
  fighting. “I’ve gone through the system of crime, I’ve sold drugs – the
  stereotypical ‘Black thing’ to do.” Now, through music, Oraka wants to tell a
  different story. Sonically, the rapper is indebted to London, switching with
  ease between grime, garage and UK funky. But on his debut mixtape, 2024’s
  Misfit, Oraka raps about mental health and race through the lens of a
  working-class northerner. On Own Kind, he is candid about feeling like an
  outsider in mainstream Black spaces: “At home, I’m way too Black / When I
  leave it’s not the same.” On No Need, he voices his mum’s fear of him ending
  up like Christopher Alder, a Black man who died in police custody in Hull in
  1998. “I’m trying to northernise the Black experience, because it’s more than
  just inner-city London,” he says. Oraka says he has encountered hostility in
  the London-centric music industry, from comments about his accent to a lack of
  interest from Black music outlets. “I really wanted to be accepted in the GRM
  Daily, Link Up TV, Mixtape Madness world – you know, the main Black media. And
  I just wasn’t getting no love,” he says. “When a Black guy raps about drugs
  and jail, it unfortunately sells, because that’s the language people
  understand. But there are stories to be told from kids who grew up like me. I
  just want a level playing field.” Oraka has since learned to embrace his
  difference as a “superpower” – hence his slogan “The Black Yorkshireman”,
  which today is emblazoned on the back of his T-shirt. A new EP, Undeniable,
  will drop in October, accompanied by a UK tour that kicks off at the New
  Adelphi Club in Hull, a tiny venue that has hosted Oasis and fellow local
  success story the Housemartins. His new music, he says, is “going to show the
  listener that I mean business. I’m coming for the title of king of the north.”
  He catches himself to avoid disrespecting the incumbent royal. “I’m not trying
  to slate Bugzy Malone – I think he’s unreal. What he’s done for northern
  rappers is mad. He created the blueprint.” Diversity in Hull has improved
  significantly since Oraka’s childhood. But after last summer’s riots and the
  election of a Reform mayor in East Yorkshire this spring, Oraka acknowledges
  that there is still work to be done. “That was embarrassing,” he says, of last
  year’s violence. “That’s not a true reflection of Hull at all. It’s just a
  very small minority. The recent election was terrible – unfortunately, a lot
  of these people are sheep. They don’t do their own research and follow the
  bandwagon. It’s very toxic.” The weight of this moment is not lost on Oraka
  and he is prepared for the pressure that comes with increased visibility.
  “This is an opportunity for young Black kids from Hull to see me supporting
  the biggest band in the world. Like: if he can do it, there’s hope for us,” he
  says, beaming. “I feel that responsibility and I’m relishing it. I was born to
  do this.” • Undeniable is released via Republic of Music on 31 October.
