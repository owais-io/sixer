  The independent New South Wales MP Mark Latham has been referred to the
  privileges committee over allegedly revealing privileged material but has
  avoided, for now, a censure in the state’s legislative council. The NSW upper
  house voted on Tuesday night to refer Latham to the powerful privileges
  committee but delayed the condemnation motion until October, when it expects
  to have the results of the privileges investigation. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email Labor’s leader in the upper house, Penny Sharpe, had pushed for a
  censure motion but the opposition, Greens and some of the minor party members
  voted against the move, arguing members should wait for the results of the
  privileges inquiry. Two MLCs from the Shooters and Fishers party abstained,
  and the Marijuana party member, Jeremy Buckingham, voted with the government.
  The government lost the vote 22 to 16. Sharpe argued Latham, a former federal
  Labor leader and then state One Nation MP, should be condemned over three
  specific incidents. This included that he allegedly breached privilege in
  relation to certain documents about the former police commissioner Karen Webb
  and investigations into gifts of gin that were produced on the basis that only
  parliamentarians could view them. Sharpe also called out Latham’s “problematic
  behaviour” of taking “photographs of his colleagues at the chamber and sending
  them to a third party alongside derogatory remarks about their appearance”.
  Last month, the Daily Telegraph published messages, reportedly sent by Latham
  to his former partner Nathalie Matthews, in which he allegedly shared photos
  of female colleagues and made disparaging comments about their appearance.
  Sharpe detailed Latham’s use of parliamentary privilege, which protects MPs
  from defamation proceedings, to share the medical records of independent MP
  Alex Greenwich. The records had been part of a workplace sexual harassment and
  vilification claim that Greenwich won against Latham. “The idea that a member
  would stand in this place and reveal private medical reports, no matter where
  they got them from, or how they’re there, is a gross abuse of privilege as
  well,” Sharpe told parliament. Greenwich on Wednesday responded to the censure
  motions against Latham being deferred, saying: “Given the seriousness of the
  issue raised, and the public outrage, it’s deeply troubling that the Greens
  voted to protect Mark Latham.” During his response to the censure motion,
  Latham said of allegations that he breached parliamentary privilege relating
  to documents about the police commissioner’s conduct: “It’s got nothing to do
  with national security, police techniques, policing methodology. “There’s
  nothing in it that warranted a non-publication order. It’s about the
  integrity, the honesty of the police commissioner.” He also resurrected a 2015
  sexual scandal that embroiled several ALP figures, and accused the state
  premier, Chris Minns, of double standards in his treatment of sexual
  allegations. The opposition defended its decision to defer a vote on the
  condemnation motion against Latham until October. Opposition leader, Mark
  Speakman, said Latham was disputing whether certain documents were in fact
  privileged and so it made sense to have the multiparty privileges committee
  investigate the circumstances first. “There are some matters in there that
  require investigation, and that’s why it’s been referred to the privileges
  committee. We haven’t knocked it out of the park,” he said. “Some of his
  behaviour seems to be pretty obvious, pretty uncontested and should be
  condemned, like the texting on the floor of parliament. That is outrageous
  behaviour and is worthy of condemnation,” he said But he said there was a
  dispute of fact raised by Latham over whether he had used confidential
  information about Greenwich which was obtained from NSW Civil and
  Administrative Tribunal. “We need to get to the bottom of exactly the extent
  to which he has abused parliamentary privilege,” he said.
