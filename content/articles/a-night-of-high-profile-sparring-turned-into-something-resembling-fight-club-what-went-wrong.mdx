  The videos are troubling. They’ve made their way online through social media
  and other postings. A club fighter, Jacob Solis, is in the ring with a
  world-class fighter named Marquis Taylor. Both men are wearing headgear. Solis
  is under the impression that this is a sparring session. Taylor has been
  incentivized to treat the encounter as something more. Solis is staggered by a
  roundhouse right to the side of his head. Lurching forward, defenseless, he’s
  punched hard again; this time by an illegal blow to the back of his head. As
  he slumps forward, a third roundhouse right – also to the back of his head –
  drives him to the canvas. There’s no referee. No one helps Solis as he
  struggles to rise and staggers toward a corner. The overflow crowd loves it.
  The blow-by-blow commentator calling the livestream, watched by thousands of
  viewers, sounds enthralled. Welcome to Sparring Club. Sparring Club is the
  creation of BoxRaw, a British company that sells men’s and women’s apparel and
  combat sports equipment. Sparring Club is important branding for BoxRaw. Its
  website features a full-screen video that shows two men in a boxing ring with
  the superimposed legend: “SPARRING CLUB: THIS IS KILL OR BE KILLED.” Recently,
  BoxRaw entered into a partnership with The Ring, which is owned by Turki
  al-Sheikh, the most powerful force in boxing. On 11 July, BoxRaw and The Ring
  promoted a Sparring Club event at the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse in
  Brooklyn. Posts on social media advertised the date, time and site, promised
  free entry for fans, and described the event as follows: “Live Pro Sparring
  from New York’s Top Prospects … Raw, Handpicked, Dog Eat Dog … Two fighters
  competing will be selected to fight on the Canelo vs Crawford undercard.” The
  social media posts served the dual purpose of attracting fans and recruiting
  fighters. A post by trainer Eric Kelly (who served as BoxRaw’s point person on
  the ground on the night of the event) declared, “Slots is slimming up. There’s
  only a few slots left. I’m only looking for killers! Professional. Who man
  enough to hop in? You say you can fight right? Let me know!” A New York
  trainer who was at the event later told the Guardian, “Eric Kelly called and
  told me he was hosting a sparring session that was sponsored by BoxRaw and The
  Ring and I should tell any pros I have in the gym that it’s a big opportunity.
  If they look good, maybe they can get a spot on the Canelo-Crawford show. So
  right there; that tells you it won’t really be sparring. It’s more like a
  tryout to be on a team. You want to make an impression and leave a mark. And
  you do that by knocking the other guy out.” On 14 June, USA Boxing, which
  oversees amateur boxing in the United States, sent a memorandum to its members
  in the New York metropolitan area. The memo noted that USA Boxing had received
  reports of “an unsanctioned boxing event” titled “Sparring Club Presents: Dog
  City, NYC” and reminded members that: (1) “Sparring as entertainment, which
  includes sparring events of any capacity, is prohibited as outlined in the USA
  Boxing Sanction Manual.” (2) “A USA Boxing athlete member shall not box in any
  boxing competition that is not sanctioned under USA Boxing.” (3) “Any boxer,
  coach or official who participates in an unsanctioned or unregulated combat
  sport is ineligible to participate in competition as an athlete or non-athlete
  member of USA Boxing.” The memorandum closed with the declaration, “USA Boxing
  takes the participation in unsanctioned events very seriously, as these events
  may jeopardize one’s standing with USA Boxing while placing innocent lives at
  risk.” A 10 July email to all USA Boxing members titled “Important Notice:
  Participation in Unsanctioned Dog City Sparring Event” elaborated on that
  warning and read in part: “It has come to our attention that an unsanctioned
  sparring event operating under the name ‘Dog City’ is circulating within our
  boxing community. We must strongly advise all USA Boxing members not to
  participate in this event or any similar activity that is not sanctioned by
  USA Boxing. Unsanctioned events do not carry the required safety protocols,
  oversight, or insurance coverage that protect our athletes, coaches, and
  officials. These events compromise the standards we uphold as the National
  Governing Body of Olympic-style amateur boxing in the United States.” Faced
  with this obstacle, BoxRaw declared that all of the event participants would
  either be professionals or have the intention to turn pro and would never
  fight as an amateur again. That solved one regulatory issue but led to
  another. All professional boxing activity in the State of New York is subject
  to regulation by the New York State Athletic Commission. More specifically,
  the New York General Business Law states, “The conduct of combative sports
  outside the supervision of the commission or an authorized sanctioning entity
  is prohibited.” The NYSAC Rules and Regulations as they relate to professional
  fights require: (1) Pre-fight medical examinations for all combatants. (2) At
  least one commission-designated doctor and at least one ambulance with medical
  personnel consisting of at least one paramedic with appropriate resuscitation
  equipment to be continuously present at ringside. (3) A post-fight medical
  evaluation of each combatant by an on-site commission-designated physician
  immediately following each match. Additionally, promoters are required to
  provide medical insurance for both amateur and professional combat sports
  events. Sparring Club took the position that it was not subject to these
  requirements since its event would consist of “sparring” rather than actual
  fights. But the General Business Law includes “sparring” as a regulated combat
  sport that must be conducted under the supervision of the commission, albeit
  with fewer requirements. And the law specifically requires that any entity
  involved in the conduct of professional sparring first procure a license from
  the commission. For example, gyms where fighters train are required to have a
  sparring license. BoxRaw submitted an application for a sparring license to
  the New York State Athletic Commission well in advance. But some of material
  necessary to finalize the application wasn’t submitted until the day of the
  event, adding an element of uncertainty to the proceedings. The event itself
  was a huge draw. In addition to the in-ring activity, fans were drawn to the
  Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse by the promise of free pizza, ice cream, and
  tickets to the following night’s fights at Louis Armstrong Stadium which would
  include Edgar Berlanga v Hamzah Sheeraz and Shakur Stevenson v William Zepeda.
  One boxing veteran recounts, “I was shocked when we got to the terminal. There
  was a line several blocks long of people waiting to get in. And when we got
  inside, the place was packed.” Inside the terminal warehouse, the atmosphere
  was festive. Turki al-Sheikh was there with promoter Eddie Hearn and Ring
  Magazine CEO Rick Reeno, who is among Sheikh’s most trusted boxing advisors.
  Hearn left early to attend the fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano
  at Madison Square Garden. His companions stayed a bit longer. There was a lot
  of security outside the ring. Inside the ropes, security was lax. Trainer
  Andre Rozier looks back on the event and says, “It was something new and
  different. They had, I think it was 26 sparring sessions. Guys were supposed
  to go three two-minute rounds with 16-ounce gloves. I had six guys there.”
  Calvin Ford, the trainer who guided Gervonta Davis to stardom, arrived with a
  van full of fighters from the Washington DC area. There were no women on the
  card. “There were a lot of fights or sparring or whatever you want to call
  it,” says a New York trainer who was at the event. “Some of it was sparring.
  And some of it was fighting. One problem was, some guys were there to spar and
  didn’t know the guy they were in with was there to fight. And the matchmaking
  was set up wrong. There was a lot of mismatches. Jacob should never have
  fought the guy he was in with. Kurt Scoby was in with a guy who had, maybe, 10
  amateur fights. I talked one of my fighters out of it when we got there.” The
  event was streamed live by The Ring. Some combatants had cornermen. Others
  didn’t. Eric Kelly served as timekeeper and called the action for fans inside
  the terminal warehouse. During some of the early fights, a man wearing a blue
  T-shirt and light-colored slacks was in the ring and told the fighters to
  break a few times. “But he wasn’t really refereeing,” a member of the on-site
  production team recalls. “Just keeping the action going. Then someone decided
  that having him in the ring made it look too much like fights – which they
  weren’t allowed to do – so they took him out.” In theory, two slots on the
  Canelo-Crawford undercard were up for grabs. Kurt Scoby is a quality fighter;
  a puncher with 15 knockouts and 17 wins in 18 pro bouts. He was matched
  against Mike Austin, a fighter who had yet to have a professional fight. Scoby
  knocked Austin down hard. But when Austin rose, Scoby backed off and didn’t
  press his advantage. That was the right thing to do. Other “sparring” was
  fought to the finish. James Yarborough from Brooklyn has never had a pro
  fight. BoxRec.com lists his amateur record as 0-and-1 (the loss being a
  walkover when he was unable to compete in a scheduled bout). Josh Popper used
  to spar with Yarborough and was the beneficiary of that walkover. “I know
  James,” Popper says. “He’s a nice guy. But I’ve never seen him win a fight.”
  Yarborough was matched against a professional from Baltimore named Ehijele
  Ubuane, a relative novice with modest skills who is trained by Ford. The first
  two rounds might have been sparring. Round three was a fight with Yarborough
  being pummeled and Ubuane’s corner urging him on, exultant when the fight was
  stopped. “It was fun,” Rozier says. “The fighters enjoyed it. The crowd
  enjoyed it. People had a good time.” Jacob Solis didn’t have a good time.
  Marquis Taylor was born, raised, and lives in Texas. He’s 31 years old and has
  been fighting professionally for 12 years. His record stands at 18-1-2 and
  he’s ranked as the No 13 middleweight in the world by the World Boxing
  Council. Solis, age 33, has been fighting for 19 months and has accumulated a
  7-0-1 ledger against fighters who are opponents for opponents. The seven men
  he beat have a composite ring record of two wins against 31 losses with 22
  “KOs by” in their most recent 33 outings. Think of Taylor and Solis in terms
  of the difference between a ranked football team from a Power Five conference
  and a team from the lower echelons of the Ivy League. Wins and losses don’t
  tell the story of the difference between them. Bobby Harrison, Taylor’s
  manager, told the Guardian, “I wasn’t there. Marquis saw something about it on
  Instagram; that Turki was giving away opportunities to fight on the
  Canelo-Crawford undercard. I didn’t even know he was going. He jumped on a
  plane with his father, who’s his trainer, got there, set his bag down, and
  went almost directly into the ring.” Solis’s participation was also arranged
  without input from his manager. A member of Jacob’s team says that Pardeep
  Singh, a brand director and production director for BoxRaw, contacted Solis
  directly to make the fight. Solis went to the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse
  expecting a sparring session with an equivalent-level fighter. Late in the
  afternoon, he learned who he’d be in the ring with. “Two young women were
  making the matchups based on approximate weight,” a friend of Solis’s says.
  “But there was no weigh-in. There wasn’t any medical examination either.” Nor
  was there a third man in the ring for the Taylor-Solis encounter. “It wasn’t
  sparring,” a trainer who was onsite recalls. “Sometimes, when a fighter is
  preparing for a fight, you have hard sparring that feels like fighting. But if
  a fighter is hurt, the guy who hurt him backs off. That’s what Kurt Scoby did
  with his guy. Taylor didn’t.” Wade Plemons was the lead commentator for The
  Ring’s video stream. An excerpt from that stream has been posted on YouTube
  with the title “INSANE Sparring in Brooklyn! BOXRAW x The Ring Sparring Club.”
  The Solis knockout segment starts at the 5:06 mark of that excerpt. “Look at
  that left hook,” Plemons shouts. “It’s all Taylor on offense right now. A
  right hand. Ooooooh! Oh, my goodness. That right there, folks; it’s going to
  be the end of this sparring session.” As Solis staggers to his feet and
  wobbles to a corner with no assistance of any kind, a voice is heard shouting
  in the background, “Get the fuck in the ring. Why y’all ain’t getting in the
  ring!” Had the session been a properly regulated fight, Taylor would likely
  have been disqualified for deliberate flagrant fouls. Solis received no
  medical attention after he was knocked out. “There was a woman walking around
  with ‘EMT’ on her shirt,” an acquaintance of Solis says. “But when Jacob went
  down, we couldn’t find her. He went back to the dressing room. No one came
  back to ask if he was OK. He got dressed, got in an Uber with a friend, and
  went home.” Meanwhile, after Taylor knocked Solis out, Taylor went to the
  ropes, looked out at the crowd, and shouted, “Where you at, Turki? Where you
  at? I’m right here. I’m the one you’ve been looking for, baby.” Bobby Harrison
  defends his fighter’s conduct, citing the promise that two fighters who
  participated in the event would be selected to fight on the Canelo-Crawford
  undercard. “This was the opportunity of a lifetime for Marquis,” Harrison
  says. “No one will fight him. He hasn’t lost in 10 years. He’s a high-risk,
  low-reward opponent. He has this great opportunity in front of Turki al-Sheikh
  to put himself on the biggest card in a decade and he gave it everything. If
  you are going to create a winner-takes-all gladiator contest, then I suggest
  you have someone in the ring with those guys to ensure their safety as they
  are all fighting for a life-changing opportunity.” Solis could be forgiven if
  he has a different point of view. He was unprotected before, during and after
  his Sparring Club ring encounter. A neurologist he saw several days later
  confirmed that he had suffered a concussion. A 25 July fight that Jacob had
  scheduled for Atlantic City was canceled. It’s unclear when he’ll be medically
  cleared to fight again. Old-time boxing fans talk fondly about the “Philly gym
  wars” of the past. But those fabled sparring sessions in Philadelphia gyms
  were waged largely between evenly matched fighters. There’s no honor in a
  world-ranked fighter beating up a novice. And consider the possible
  consequences. Suppose Solis had suffered a brain bleed or, worse, wound up in
  a coma. The potential financial liability incurred by BoxRaw’s Sparring Club
  would have been enormous. And the toll in human suffering would have been
  greater. Josh Popper, a close friend of Solis, was invited to participate in
  the Sparring Club event but chose not to attend. “I don’t have much to say
  about it because I wasn’t there,” Popper told the Guardian. “But I will say
  that, in sparring, you’re not looking for knockouts. There’s different levels
  of sparring. Sometimes there’s an understanding that you’ll be going hard.
  Sometimes it’s about timing and working on things you’re trying to develop.
  And you might have a one-punch flash knockout. Those things happen. That’s
  just the way it is. But this wasn’t a one-punch flash knockout. Jacob went
  there with the intention of sparring. The other guy? You tell me.” Several
  days after the Sparring Club event, Samantha McEachin, counsel for the New
  York State Athletic Commission, sent an inquiry letter to Pardeep Singh,
  asking inter alia for a list of participants, injuries and all available
  videos of the action. Singh did not respond to two requests from the Guardian
  for an interview to discuss the event. The NYSAC might determine that no
  rules, regulations or statutes were broken. Alternatively, it could issue
  fines, suspend or revoke licenses, or refer the matter to the New York State
  Attorney General for civil proceedings. The event was poorly organized from a
  safety point of view. There were instances where the combatants were
  mismatched. There was no third man in the ring to properly protect either
  participant. Common-sense medical safeguards were non-existent. The key legal
  issue will be where the commission draws the line between sparring and
  fighting. Meanwhile, after the event, BoxRaw posted numerous “Sparring Club”
  clips on social media. “Respect isn’t given,” the narrator of one clip says.
  “It’s earned in blood.” On 30 July, Box Raw posted an invitation for “the
  Middle East’s top prospects” to appear at a new Sparring Club event to be held
  in Riyadh on 15 August with the lure of “food, drinks, chaos” and the promise
  that “1 fighter will be scouted for a Ring Magazine undercard.” “No crown
  without blood,” the post pledged. And on 30 July, Bobby Harrison told the
  Guardian, “We just got an offer for Marquis to fight in Las Vegas during fight
  week for Canelo-Crawford. The details haven’t been worked out yet, but I think
  it will happen.” Thomas Hauser’s email address is
  thomashauserwriter@gmail.com. His next book – The Most Honest Sport: Two More
  Years Inside Boxing – will be published this month and is available for
  preorder. In 2019, Hauser was selected for boxing’s highest honor - induction
  into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

A 25 July fight that Jacob had scheduled for Atlantic City was canceled. It’s unclear when he’ll be medically cleared to fight again. Old-time boxing fans talk fondly about the “Philly gym wars” of the past. But those fabled sparring sessions in Philadelphia gyms were waged largely between evenly matched fighters. There’s no honor in a world-ranked fighter beating up a novice. And consider the possible consequences. Suppose Solis had suffered a brain bleed or, worse, wound up in a coma. The potential financial liability incurred by BoxRaw’s Sparring Club would have been enormous. And the toll in human suffering would have been greater. Josh Popper, a close friend of Solis, was invited to participate in the Sparring Club event but chose not to attend. “I don’t have much to say about it because I wasn’t there,” Popper told the Guardian. “But I will say that, in sparring, you’re not looking for knockouts. There’s different levels of sparring. Sometimes there’s an understanding that you’ll be going hard. Sometimes it’s about timing and working on things you’re trying to develop. And you might have a one-punch flash knockout. Those things happen. That’s just the way it is. But this wasn’t a one-punch flash knockout. Jacob went there with the intention of sparring. The other guy? You tell me.” Several days after the Sparring Club event, Samantha McEachin, counsel for the New York State Athletic Commission, sent an inquiry letter to Pardeep Singh, asking inter alia for a list of participants, injuries and all available videos of the action. Singh did not respond to two requests from the Guardian for an interview to discuss the event. The NYSAC might determine that no rules, regulations or statutes were broken. Alternatively, it could issue fines, suspend or revoke licenses, or refer the matter to the New York State Attorney General for civil proceedings. The event was poorly organized from a safety point of view. There were instances where the combatants were mismatched. There was no third man in the ring to properly protect either participant. Common-sense medical safeguards were non-existent. The key legal issue will be where the commission draws the line between sparring and fighting. Meanwhile, after the event, BoxRaw posted numerous “Sparring Club” clips on social media. “Respect isn’t given,” the narrator of one clip says. “It’s earned in blood.” On 30 July, Box Raw posted an invitation for “the Middle East’s top prospects” to appear at a new Sparring Club event to be held in Riyadh on 15 August with the lure of “food, drinks, chaos” and the promise that “1 fighter will be scouted for a Ring Magazine undercard.” “No crown without blood,” the post pledged. And on 30 July, Bobby Harrison told the Guardian, “We just got an offer for Marquis to fight in Las Vegas during fight week for Canelo-Crawford. The details haven’t been worked out yet, but I think it will happen.” Thomas Hauser’s email address is thomashauserwriter@gmail.com.
