  A second woman has come forward to an inquiry investigating sexual abuse
  allegations against Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the international
  criminal court (ICC), the Guardian has learned. The woman has alleged that
  while working for the prominent British lawyer earlier in his career, he
  behaved inappropriately, subjecting her to unwanted sexual advances, abused
  his authority over her, and repeatedly sought to pressure her into sexual
  activity. Khan, who denies sexual misconduct “of any kind”, has temporarily
  stepped aside as head of the ICC’s prosecution division as he awaits the
  outcome of the inquiry into separate abuse allegations brought by a member of
  his staff at the court. Launched last year, the inquiry by a UN watchdog
  received the new allegations from the second woman this summer. Its
  investigators are understood to have conducted several interviews in order to
  examine her claims, which date back to 2009. At the time, the woman was in her
  20s and working as an unpaid intern for Khan. He was a leading defence lawyer
  at the ICC and other war crimes tribunals in The Hague, having notably
  represented the former Liberian president Charles Taylor. Speaking exclusively
  to the Guardian, the woman said Khan abused his power and influence over her
  and described his behaviour as a “constant onslaught” of advances. “He
  shouldn’t have been doing it,” she said. “He was my employer.” The woman spoke
  on condition of anonymity as she fears reprisals and adverse consequences for
  her and her family if publicly identified. She came forward after reading
  about the more recent allegations made against Khan by the ICC staffer. The
  second woman’s account of Khan’s alleged mistreatment of her contains several
  similarities to the staffer’s allegations, details of which have been shared
  by people familiar with her claims. Both women have alleged that Khan would
  ask them to come to work at his home. There, they each allege, he would sit
  beside them on a couch, touch them, kiss them and try to persuade them to lie
  down with him. Lawyers for Khan did not address specific details of either
  woman’s allegations but said: “It is wholly untrue that he has engaged in
  sexual misconduct of any kind.” They said Khan “categorically denies” having
  “harassed or mistreated any individual, or having misused his position or
  authority, or engaged in any conduct that could be interpreted as coercive,
  exploitative, or professionally inappropriate”. They claimed Khan had provided
  detailed evidence to the inquiry that “sits squarely at odds with the
  allegations that have been put to him” and “in a number of material respects
  show those allegations to be demonstrably untrue”. Khan, 55, was elected in
  2021 to serve a nine-year term as chief prosecutor. He is in effect the public
  face of the ICC, a permanent court of last resort that investigates and
  prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities. Since taking office, Khan has
  raised the court’s profile and thrust it into the crosshairs of major powers,
  with arrest warrants issued for suspects including the Russia’s Vladimir Putin
  and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu. His tenure was thrown into turmoil last year
  when the allegations made by the ICC staffer became public. The woman, a
  lawyer in her 30s who worked directly for him, alleges the misconduct occurred
  over an extended period between 2023 and 2024. Khan and his representatives
  have sought to cast the emergence of the allegations as part of a campaign by
  hostile external actors to discredit and put pressure on him in response to
  actions he has taken against Netanyahu and the former Israeli defence minister
  Yoav Gallant. While the Guardian understands there have been attempts by
  pro-Israeli actors to brief journalists and leak information about the ICC
  staffer’s complaint, it has found no evidence to suggest either woman has
  raised the allegations as part of an elaborate plot against the prosecutor.
  Once the UN watchdog’s investigation is completed, its findings will be
  reviewed by a panel of judicial experts who will advise the ICC’s governing
  body if any action should be taken against Khan. If he is found to have
  committed “serious misconduct” or a serious breach of his duties, the
  prosecutor could face an unprecedented reckoning: a secret ballot in which the
  ICC’s 125 member states would vote on whether to remove him from office.
  ‘Confused and humiliated’ As the sexual abuse allegations shook the ICC last
  year, Khan issued a statement insisting that in 30 years of working in
  “diverse contexts” there had “never been any such complaint lodged against me
  by anyone”. Patricia (not her real name) said that when she read about the
  allegations and saw Khan’s statement, her “heart sank”. She said that
  previously, as an intern at the start of her career, she had felt unable to
  make a formal complaint. Patricia said that before going to work for Khan she
  had viewed the internship as an “exciting and meaningful” opportunity. “Karim
  was a well-connected, well-respected person who could make things happen, and
  someone who would put a good word in for you,” she said. However, she said
  working for Khan “came at a price it shouldn’t have come at, and the price it
  came at did disturb and distress me for some time afterwards”. According to
  Patricia, an early experience of Khan’s alleged misconduct occurred at the
  court’s offices where she claimed Khan “groped” her breasts with a “prolonged”
  caress that was “completely unconsented”. “It wasn’t like ‘oops, I brushed the
  back of my hand against you, I’m sorry’,” she said. “He was too close.”
  Patricia said the incident in the office left her “confused and humiliated”,
  but over the following weeks she was required to work closely with Khan on
  preparing part of a case. During this period, she said, Khan asked her on at
  least six occasions to work at his home in The Hague, where they would be
  alone together. She said that when working at his apartment she had to
  negotiate his advances while trying to get work done. “I was trying to figure
  out how to stay in his good graces and get the work experience while not
  sleeping with him and succumbing,” she said. This was difficult, she said,
  “because when we were in his house it was just like a constant onslaught”. She
  claimed that each time she worked at the apartment “it would be another round
  of [Khan] sitting next to me on the couch and touching me and kissing me and
  trying to convince me to sleep with him”. Patricia said she “felt trapped” at
  the time. She was covering the costs of the internship and felt it was vital
  she received a positive letter of recommendation from Khan. Complaining was
  not an option, she said, and the choice she faced was to “either persevere or
  leave”. “It felt critical to me to get through the experience,” she said. “I
  remember walking to his house and feeling like I had to amp myself up, feeling
  like I had to fortify myself.” She said she refused Khan’s explicit requests
  to have sex. “I remember coming up with all kinds of dumb excuses for why I
  did not want to sleep with him, just to try and not make him angry.” She said
  although she was “miserable” and depressed while working for Khan, she decided
  to stay. After the internship had finished, she received a glowing
  recommendation letter from Khan. She said it “felt like a deal with the
  devil”. Patricia said she remained in touch with Khan for several years as she
  felt a professional need to keep on good terms with him. Over time, she said,
  she came to realise how Khan’s behaviour had affected her. She said Khan would
  send her messages from time to time long after the internship, though she
  eventually stopped responding. In 2019, she received what she described as a
  “weird message” out of the blue. Khan said he was thinking about her. He
  thanked her for her “good company” and for “being a very good friend to me”.
  She replied: “Karim, it does not make me happy to hear from you, that is why I
  do not respond. I wish you wouldn’t contact me, please don’t do it any more.”
  She did not hear from Khan again. ICC staffer: ‘Ceaseless’ advances After
  reading about the ICC staffer’s allegations against Khan last year, Patricia
  contacted the Guardian. She said she was “disturbed” that something similar to
  her experience was alleged to have happened again so many years later. This
  summer she provided formal testimony to the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight
  Services (OIOS), the body investigating the ICC staffer’s allegations. A
  source familiar with the inquiry said the watchdog had reviewed material
  shared by Patricia and interviewed people close to her. A spokesperson for the
  OIOS said it did not comment on its investigation activities. For the past
  nine months, investigators have been examining the ICC staffer’s allegations.
  As the Guardian reported last year, her claims include allegations of coercive
  sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. The alleged sexual misconduct is said
  to have occurred in hotel rooms during work trips, in Khan’s office at the ICC
  and at his home. Since then, new details have emerged about the staffer’s
  allegations. Several ICC sources and other individuals with knowledge of the
  claims said there were multiple instances of alleged sexual abuse said to have
  occurred at Khan’s home after she was asked to go there for work reasons.
  According to two sources, the staffer has alleged Khan would often bring her
  over to a couch in the living room where he would touch her and attempt to
  persuade her to engage in sexual activity. She is said to have tried to avoid
  his advances and attempted to make excuses to leave. The staffer has described
  Khan’s advances at his home as “ceaseless”. In one record of the allegations,
  she said: “He would try to kiss me and I would always move my head away and
  move back and he would tell me to stop moving and say ‘kiss me, kiss me’.”
  Khan’s position The law firm representing Khan, Carter-Ruck, said he had an
  unblemished record and denied the allegations. They said he was “cooperating
  fully and transparently” with the ongoing inquiry but that he had “grave
  concerns as to whether the investigation can deliver due process”. They
  claimed Khan “has been the subject of an orchestrated campaign” and said he
  was aware of attempts to “discredit him and destroy his personal reputation
  through the media, as a direct consequence of his role in issuing the arrest
  warrants” for Netanyahu and Gallant. Last year the Guardian, with the
  Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet
  Local Call, revealed how Israel’s intelligence agencies had run a campaign
  against the ICC. This included a Mossad operation that attempted to intimidate
  and smear Khan’s predecessor Fatou Bensouda. Against this backdrop, Khan and
  people acting on his behalf have sought to suggest in private and to
  journalists that he is the subject of a similar effort by Israeli
  intelligence. In recent weeks, outlets such as Middle East Eye (MEE) and Le
  Monde have published reports about pressures purportedly placed on Khan. An
  MEE article claimed the ICC’s investigation into Israeli war crimes had been
  “derailed by threats, leaks and sex claims”, and raised questions about the
  reliability of the staffer’s allegations. Five ICC sources familiar with
  Khan’s response to the claims when the allegations first surfaced told the
  Guardian that his team concluded it was highly unlikely the abuse claims were
  part of an intelligence operation. One of the sources said pro-Israeli
  interests “may have exploited the story but they didn’t create the story”. The
  ICC staffer at the heart of the inquiry has been particularly distressed by
  suggestions she is part of a pro-Israeli plot, according to people who know
  her. They noted that she is Muslim, and was known within the prosecutor’s
  office to have been supportive of its investigation into senior Israeli
  officials’ crimes in Gaza.
