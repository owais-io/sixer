  Two days before we meet, James Norton turned 40. To celebrate, he threw a
  massive party at his home in north-east London – and he’s still feeling the
  effects. “I didn’t get any sleep,” he admits, “and yesterday was just a huge
  clear-up, so if I struggle for a word or an anecdote, please forgive me.” To
  be fair, I’ve seen Norton in worse shape. The last time I encountered him in
  person he was naked, crawling around on all fours while being spat at. “Oh,
  yeah,” he smiles, realising I’m talking about his performance as Jude in the
  2023 stage version of A Little Life. In that play, an adaptation of Hanya
  Yanagihara’s cult tragic novel, he remained on stage at the Savoy theatre in
  London for its whopping three-and-a-half-hour length, fully immersed in a
  character who suffers an immense, seemingly never-ending ordeal of sexual
  abuse and self-harm. “That was a proper … ” He trails off and exhales. “That
  was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.” Norton has talked in the
  past about how playing Jude took it out of him – he would find himself unable
  to stop crying, or rendered catatonic. Despite all this, the moment the play
  ended he thought, “What if that’s it? What if it’s never as challenging again?
  It’s like those people who run a marathon, it nearly kills them, and then two
  weeks later they want to sign up for another.” This is what we’re here to talk
  about today: the career equivalent of that second marathon. For Norton, it’s
  two huge TV projects, the kind that could turn him from one of Britain’s most
  admired actors – known for playing complex men in shows such as Happy Valley
  and films such as Mr Jones – into a global name (not for nothing have rumours
  persisted that he could be the next Bond). First is King &amp; Conqueror, the
  new BBC drama he has been working on with his production company, Rabbit
  Track, for seven years. It tells the epic story of 1066 and the battle between
  Harold Godwinson (Norton) and William, Duke of Normandy (Nikolaj
  Coster-Waldau) for the English crown. Then there’s House of Guinness, a glossy
  Netflix drama about the Irish stout dynasty, written by Steven Knight who made
  Peaky Blinders. They are landing at a moment that feels transformative for the
  actor – and not only because of any just-turned-40 jitters. A few years ago,
  Norton had been worried that acting was frivolous – “dressing up and fucking
  around” as he puts it. But A Little Life made him realise that, no, it has a
  purpose. He would meet real-life abuse survivors at the stage door every night
  and learn how important the show had been for them. It made him think about
  his own past, as a victim of bullies while a young teen at boarding school.
  And by literally baring all on stage, he became more open, even if said
  openness – such as spilling his feelings about his 2023 split with former
  fiancee and fellow actor Imogen Poots, during a panel at this year’s
  Glastonbury festival, which went viral on TikTok – sometimes leaves him
  feeling exposed. “If I’d known there was a journalist in the audience I
  probably wouldn’t have been so honest,” he says with a smile. “I’m realising
  more and more everyone has a fucking phone.” We meet in Ham Yard, fittingly
  the same Soho hotel where Norton celebrated A Little Life’s closing party. He
  cycled here alone and I spot him wandering around the bar, looking for someone
  who might feasibly be a journalist. In his baggy trousers and T-shirt, he
  makes for cheerful, relaxed company, though he assures me he often turns up to
  interviews dripping in sweat from having pedalled frantically to make it on
  time. He has a puppyish enthusiasm for his work and when he smiles – which is
  often – his eyes crinkle up and close. When a passing woman interrupts us to
  tell him, “I think you’re an amazing actor,” he bashfully thanks her before
  turning to me and pretending he’s writing this piece: “And at this point, the
  actor’s mum turns up.” Norton orders tea – Earl Grey with a spot of oat milk –
  and tells me about King &amp; Conqueror. “I put my hands up and admit I didn’t
  know the story at all,” he says. “I just had a vague gloss of it from school.
  I wasn’t aware of the relationship Harold and William had before the battle,
  that they were friends and allies for many years before they realised that,
  because of the way Europe was being carved up, they would both inevitably end
  up on a battlefield – and one of them would have to die.” The Rest Is History
  podcast once compared the events leading up to 1066 to Game of Thrones, and
  Norton agrees. “It’s mad to think nobody has really done it before,” he says.
  “And that’s one of the reasons we spent so long developing it.” Producing is
  clearly new territory for Norton. King &amp; Conqueror was shot in Iceland,
  and he found himself struggling with concepts that don’t normally intrude on
  an actor’s consciousness, such as budget. “It’s the closest I’ve ever come to
  feeling like I’d bitten off too much,” Norton says. “I started using the word
  ‘burnout’, which is just, like, oh God.” He likes to play down any struggles
  he talks about, hyper aware people may be thinking, “Oh, give it a rest,
  you’re making television.” But he’s also keen to point out that being under
  pressure is really his ideal performance state: “I just do better. Too much
  time and space makes me slightly inert.” Far less stressful, he says, is his
  forthcoming role – purely as an actor – in House of Guinness. No budget
  worries here: he plays Sean Rafferty, a whip-cracking hardman who keeps the
  stout company’s workers in line while the Guinness siblings fall into a
  Succession-style squabble over inheritance, sparked by their father Sir
  Benjamin’s devilishly crafted will. Norton – who used a special accent coach
  to nail not only the area (Dublin) but also the period (mid-19th century) –
  says an awful lot of Guinness 0.0 was consumed on set. And off set? “We shot
  it in Liverpool, which is full of good Irish pubs. So, yeah, we were splitting
  the Gs and all that.” He’s referring to the art of making sure your first gulp
  of Guinness leaves the pint settled at the “G” on the branded glass. Did he
  perfect it? “I think I did,” he says, sounding very unsure. “It usually
  happened later in the night. I mean … I’ve got vague memories of jumping
  around a pub.” Whether on or off camera, Norton feels comfortable at the
  centre of the action these days, which hasn’t always been the case. Back when
  he was starting out as an actor, he auditioned for Fifty Shades of Grey. “And
  I remember the director saying, ‘Can you be a bit more charismatic?’” He
  laughs. “That’s the hardest thing to just try and do! Especially since I was
  too young and self-conscious to even really know what she meant.” These days,
  he thinks he has acquired the age and experience to perform a darkly magnetic
  character such as Rafferty. “And it felt great,” he says. “Because it taps
  into that alter ego of who you’d love to be. He’s violent, but he’s romantic,
  too. There’s a thug in all of us.” Norton portrayed one of the great villains
  of British television in Happy Valley’s Tommy Lee Royce. The character he
  helped create – charming, psychopathic, but in glimpses vulnerable, too – is
  what he does perfectly. His roles often strike a nerve because they wrestle
  with the pressures and flaws of modern masculinity. The secret to playing a
  character like Royce, he says, is that you have to like them on some level.
  “In the early stages, someone like Tommy was defined only by cruelty and
  violence, when in fact he’s defined by damage, trauma and fear. So the way in
  is trying to separate acts that are inherently abhorrent and unforgivable from
  the context. And the context is that, nearly always, anyone capable of that
  type of cruelty has been subjected to cruelty. So he’s just a deeply sad,
  damaged man. Maybe ‘like’ is the wrong word, but empathy for sure.” Happy
  Valley made Norton a household name, but he says he has been lucky that his
  career has involved big next steps rather than giant leaps that might have
  left him out of his depth. He started in theatre, and did some guest days on
  TV and film, before Happy Valley was followed by shows such as Grantchester,
  in which he played sleuthing vicar Sidney Chambers, and McMafia, as the son of
  a Russian mafia boss living in London. Then came the chance to do A Little
  Life. The thought of playing the lead terrified Norton – which was the reason
  Poots and his agent told him he had to do it. If playing Jude was gruelling,
  there were other factors that made it even harder for Norton. At 22 he was
  diagnosed with diabetes and, as a result, is constantly hooked up via
  Bluetooth to a glucose monitor (he has to self-inject up to 15 times a day).
  For A Little Life he carefully stashed sugar gels around the stage to help him
  stay on top of things. If the Bluetooth failed, a stage manager would be on
  alert to get the message to him. “Someone might be doing an intimate scene
  with me, or something violent, and when they were close up they’d whisper
  ‘three point two’, then carry on. It was intense.” On only one occasion did
  Norton fail to respond in time. “One horrible thing about having a
  hypoglycemic moment is you get a kind of clarity at first, which makes you
  think you don’t need sugar. Then what happens next is like a sort of terrible
  psychedelic trip, where you’re so confused you don’t know where you are.” It
  happened during a scene where he was required to run around the stage. “It was
  terrifying. I was dripping with sweat, dropping my lines, confused. The actors
  could all tell something wasn’t right.” When the play first opened, some
  audience members disobeyed the strict no-cameras rule and snapped Norton
  during his naked scenes – photos even ended up appearing on MailOnline. He
  must have felt violated? “Yeah … I mean, violated is probably too strong. My
  strongest memory is that it was just a bit sad, a bit gross, this idea that it
  would be framed in a kind of titillating way when the subject matter was so
  clearly vicious and upsetting. But I think the reaction, generally, was that
  it was misjudged, which was gratifying.” The naked scenes caused a lot of
  noise around the show. Norton said at the time he thought “as a culture”, we
  are “scared of the penis”, though he thinks we have since become a lot better
  at accepting male nudity on screen. Have we, though, I wonder? The biggest
  (excuse the pun) example of male nudity I can think of is The White Lotus,
  which involved the use of giant prosthetic ones. If those are what we’re all
  looking at, no wonder society is scared of the penis. “Yeah, that is a bit
  weird,” Norton muses. “But I think it’s deliberate – they want it to be big,
  right? It’s like in Pam &amp; Tommy, where there’s an animatronic penis that
  talks.” He laughs while considering his position on all of this. “I can say
  that I have never had a prosthetic or an animatronic penis. All my penis work
  is my own.” He falls silent. “Oh shit, that’s going to be the headline, isn’t
  it? Do I need to call my publicist?” * * * Norton was born in south London but
  grew up in Malton, North Yorkshire. He has described his childhood as
  “idyllic” but that’s not exactly true. He was sent to boarding school and
  found himself being tormented by bullies there. “It’s that thing where a lot
  of boys are having separation anxiety, feelings of fear and confusion as to
  why they’ve been taken out of their home at the age of 11,” he says. “A lot of
  people retreat into themselves, and others deal with that same confusion by
  doing that Lord of the Flies thing and becoming the bully. I was young for my
  year and I became an exciting target because I would react to things that were
  thrown my way. I didn’t have the self-awareness to just go: whatever.” Norton
  has a tendency to play it down, but he acknowledges that the scars have stayed
  with him. “Oh, for sure. It’s something that is part of the jigsaw puzzle of
  my 40-now years.” In fact, part of the reason he took on the role of Jude was
  that he thought it might somehow rid him of the bullied child within. Did it
  go deeper than that: did he see fame as an act of revenge on the bullies?
  “There’s a sort of byproduct to the acting thing, which is that the barometer
  of your success is the public reaction,” he says. “That can get hijacked by
  parts of your personality which are needing affirmation, which we all have.
  That part of me is gratified by the feeling of being on a billboard or
  whatever. Then you step away from that and realise it’s not going to really
  get rid of that need for affirmation, because nothing will.” Norton thought he
  had a decent gauge when it came to not letting work intrude on his personal
  life. “I’ve always been clear about it taking up too much space at the expense
  of relationships and friendships,” he says. “But A Little Life, more than any
  other job, was where that didn’t happen. It took everything out of me.” As an
  outside observer, it’s hard not to wonder if the pressure he put himself under
  contributed to his split with Poots after six years. But he says no. “That
  happened naturally and amicably. Two actors going out is always challenging
  because of scheduling. We were travelling a lot. And that was one of many
  factors that brought a very happy relationship to an end.” Norton has given a
  decent impression of a man pretty comfortable with all aspects of fame – but
  since the split he has found the attention on his love life oppressive. “I’ve
  always tried to balance authenticity with privacy,” he says. “I want to be
  honest but I don’t want to talk about my relationships at all and I don’t like
  it when I get photographed with a friend walking down the street and it’s then
  told the next day like it’s a romance. Another romance!” The week before we
  meet there has indeed been tabloid speculation about various women in Norton’s
  life. He was photographed with the stylist Flora Huddart; before that he was
  hanging out at the Lido festival in London with Lily Allen. “Snogging”, one
  tabloid reported, although if you actually looked at the pictures … “I’m not
  snogging them! Funny that, isn’t it?” he says. Norton is laughing while we
  discuss this, but there’s a subtle vibe shift in the room. Five minutes ago it
  felt as if he would have happily sat here chatting away for hours. Now, maybe
  he has an eye on the clock. “Look,” he says, “I’m a man in London going on
  occasional dates, meeting people, living my life, and it’s kind of no one’s
  business really.” Which is, of course, fair enough. The only reason he talked
  about his romantic life at Glastonbury, he says, was because Annie Mac asked
  him if he had experienced any big life changes, and he always tries to answer
  things honestly. “I was like, well, I had a breakup and that was a massive
  change.” He says he has been fortunate to go through life without having to
  deal with any major grief, but that he came to realise the split was a kind of
  grief in itself. “I lost the person,” he told the crowd, “but I also lost the
  life I was about to lead, the kids we had named, all that kind of stuff.” It
  probably didn’t help matters that, as he approached 40, Norton was starting to
  pick up roles as dads in shows such as Playing Nice (he calls it his “sad dad
  era”). “If you’d asked me at 25, I probably thought I might have a kid by 40,”
  he says. “But equally, I had a fucking great 30s, and hopefully kids might
  still be in my life at some point. That’s the privilege of being a man and not
  having to worry about my biological clock.” In a way, he says, he’s more
  relaxed now than he was a decade ago when everyone around him started having
  kids. “I think I did feel that pressure to get on the train, do the same
  thing.” If Norton sounds Zen about it all now, there are good reasons why.
  After the split from Poots he went to Plum Village, a Buddhist retreat in
  France set up by the Vietnamese monk and activist Thích Nhat Hanh. Norton
  actually studied theology at Cambridge before he trained at Rada, specialising
  in Buddhist and Hindu faith, and as a teenager he had a period where he became
  “very committed” to Catholicism. But this is different, he says. “With
  Buddhism, you don’t really talk about faith. The teaching isn’t about worship.
  It’s about the self. It’s about one’s own journey and experience of the world.
  And it’s been amazing for me. It’s an incredible community and it’s given me
  an opportunity to just stop and recognise the value of quiet, peaceful space,
  which I don’t often give myself in life. Even just to rest and sleep. I think
  for a lot of my younger years I thought inaction and stasis was just a waste
  of time.” There’s certainly not too much sleep or rest going on. Norton’s new
  producing gig is almost a full-time job, and a different one. “I sit at a
  desk, discuss ideas and read scripts. It’s broader and more empowering than
  just turning up very late in the development process as an actor.” He will be
  appearing in about half of the shows Rabbit Track produce, and there are other
  gigs, too – he has been filming Sunny Dancer, a British comedy about a teenage
  cancer survivor going to “chemo camp”, and will appear as Ormund Hightower,
  leading a march on King’s Landing, in season three of House of the Dragon. * *
  * Norton has been generous with his time, but it’s the moment to wrap things
  up. I sense a hint of relief that there will be no more prying questions. “Was
  that OK?” I ask. “Or was it a bit … ” “Yeah, you went close,” he says,
  laughing. It’s only later that I start to wonder what he meant by that. I went
  close … to what, exactly? Him storming out? Throwing me a Tommy Lee
  Royce-style punch before drenching me in Earl Grey and oat milk? It’s all
  rather hard to imagine. The James Norton of today seems to be able to smile
  gracefully, suck up any negativity and take it all in his stride. He seems
  extremely content; secure in his own skin while restlessly creative. And all
  of that with a whopping hangover. • King &amp; Conqueror airs on BBC One and
  iPlayer later this month. House of Guinness is on Netflix in September.

Two days before we meet, James Norton turned 40. To celebrate, he threw a massive party at his home in north-east London – and he’s still feeling the effects. “I didn’t get any sleep,” he admits, “and yesterday was just a huge clear-up, so if I struggle for a word or an anecdote, please forgive me.” To be fair, I’ve seen Norton in worse shape. The last time I encountered him in person he was naked, crawling around on all fours while being spat at. “Oh, yeah,” he smiles, realising I’m talking about his performance as Jude in the 2023 stage version of A Little Life.

Despite all this, the moment the play ended he thought, “What if that’s it? What if it’s never as challenging again? It’s like those people who run a marathon, it nearly kills them, and then two weeks later they want to sign up for another.” This is what we’re here to talk about today: the career equivalent of that second marathon. For Norton, it’s two huge TV projects, the kind that could turn him from one of Britain’s most admired actors – known for playing complex men in shows such as Happy Valley and films such as Mr Jones – into a global name (not for nothing have rumours persisted that he could be the next Bond). First is King &amp; Conqueror, the new BBC drama he has been working on with his production company, Rabbit Track, for seven years. It tells the epic story of 1066 and the battle between Harold Godwinson (Norton) and William, Duke of Normandy (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) for the English crown. Then there’s House of Guinness, a glossy Netflix drama about the Irish stout dynasty, written by Steven Knight who made Peaky Blinders. They are landing at a moment that feels transformative for the actor – and not only because of any just-turned-40 jitters. A few years ago, Norton had been worried that acting was frivolous – “dressing up and fucking around” as he puts it. But A Little Life made him realise that, no, it has a purpose. He would meet real-life abuse survivors at the stage door every night and learn how important the show had been for them.

Too much time and space makes me slightly inert.” Far less stressful, he says, is his forthcoming role – purely as an actor – in House of Guinness. No budget worries here: he plays Sean Rafferty, a whip-cracking hardman who keeps the stout company’s workers in line while the Guinness siblings fall into a Succession-style squabble over inheritance, sparked by their father Sir Benjamin’s devilishly crafted will. Norton – who used a special accent coach to nail not only the area (Dublin) but also the period (mid-19th century) – says an awful lot of Guinness 0.0 was consumed on set.

Did it go deeper than that: did he see fame as an act of revenge on the bullies? “There’s a sort of byproduct to the acting thing, which is that the barometer of your success is the public reaction,” he says. “That can get hijacked by parts of your personality which are needing affirmation, which we all have. That part of me is gratified by the feeling of being on a billboard or whatever. Then you step away from that and realise it’s not going to really get rid of that need for affirmation, because nothing will.” Norton thought he had a decent gauge when it came to not letting work intrude on his personal life. “I’ve always been clear about it taking up too much space at the expense of relationships and friendships,” he says. “But A Little Life, more than any other job, was where that didn’t happen. It took everything out of me.” As an outside observer, it’s hard not to wonder if the pressure he put himself under contributed to his split with Poots after six years. But he says no. “That happened naturally and amicably. Two actors going out is always challenging because of scheduling. We were travelling a lot. And that was one of many factors that brought a very happy relationship to an end.” Norton has given a decent impression of a man pretty comfortable with all aspects of fame – but since the split he has found the attention on his love life oppressive. “I’ve always tried to balance authenticity with privacy,” he says. “I want to be honest but I don’t want to talk about my relationships at all and I don’t like it when I get photographed with a friend walking down the street and it’s then told the next day like it’s a romance. Another romance!” The week before we meet there has indeed been tabloid speculation about various women in Norton’s life. He was photographed with the stylist Flora Huddart; before that he was hanging out at the Lido festival in London with Lily Allen. “Snogging”, one tabloid reported, although if you actually looked at the pictures … “I’m not snogging them! Funny that, isn’t it?” he says. Norton is laughing while we discuss this, but there’s a subtle vibe shift in the room. Five minutes ago it felt as if he would have happily sat here chatting away for hours. Now, maybe he has an eye on the clock. “Look,” he says, “I’m a man in London going on occasional dates, meeting people, living my life, and it’s kind of no one’s business really.” Which is, of course, fair enough. The only reason he talked about his romantic life at Glastonbury, he says, was because Annie Mac asked him if he had experienced any big life changes, and he always tries to answer things honestly. “I was like, well, I had a breakup and that was a massive change.” He says he has been fortunate to go through life without having to deal with any major grief, but that he came to realise the split was a kind of grief in itself. “I lost the person,” he told the crowd, “but I also lost the life I was about to lead, the kids we had named, all that kind of stuff.” It probably didn’t help matters that, as he approached 40, Norton was starting to pick up roles as dads in shows such as Playing Nice (he calls it his “sad dad era”). “If you’d asked me at 25, I probably thought I might have a kid by 40,” he says. “But equally, I had a fucking great 30s, and hopefully kids might still be in my life at some point. That’s the privilege of being a man and not having to worry about my biological clock.” In a way, he says, he’s more relaxed now than he was a decade ago when everyone around him started having kids. “I think I did feel that pressure to get on the train, do the same thing.” If Norton sounds Zen about it all now, there are good reasons why. After the split from Poots he went to Plum Village, a Buddhist retreat in France set up by the Vietnamese monk and activist Thích Nhat Hanh. Norton actually studied theology at Cambridge before he trained at Rada, specialising in Buddhist and Hindu faith, and as a teenager he had a period where he became “very committed” to Catholicism. But this is different, he says. “With Buddhism, you don’t really talk about faith. The teaching isn’t about worship. It’s about the self. It’s about one’s own journey and experience of the world. And it’s been amazing for me. It’s an incredible community and it’s given me an opportunity to just stop and recognise the value of quiet, peaceful space, which I don’t often give myself in life. Even just to rest and sleep. I think for a lot of my younger years I thought inaction and stasis was just a waste of time.” There’s certainly not too much sleep or rest going on. Norton’s new producing gig is almost a full-time job, and a different one. “I sit at a desk, discuss ideas and read scripts. It’s broader and more empowering than just turning up very late in the development process as an actor.” He will be appearing in about half of the shows Rabbit Track produce, and there are other gigs, too – he has been filming Sunny Dancer, a British comedy about a teenage cancer survivor going to “chemo camp”, and will appear as Ormund Hightower, leading a march on King’s Landing, in season three of House of the Dragon. * * * Norton has been generous with his time, but it’s the moment to wrap things up. I sense a hint of relief that there will be no more prying questions. “Was that OK?” I ask. “Or was it a bit … ” “Yeah, you went close,” he says, laughing. It’s only later that I start to wonder what he meant by that. I went close … to what, exactly? Him storming out? Throwing me a Tommy Lee Royce-style punch before drenching me in Earl Grey and oat milk? It’s all rather hard to imagine. The James Norton of today seems to be able to smile gracefully, suck up any negativity and take it all in his stride. He seems extremely content; secure in his own skin while restlessly creative. And all of that with a whopping hangover. • King &amp; Conqueror airs on BBC One and iPlayer later this month. House of Guinness is on Netflix in September.
