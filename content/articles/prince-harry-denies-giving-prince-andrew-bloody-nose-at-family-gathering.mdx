  Prince Harry has denied he gave Prince Andrew “a bloody nose” during a fight
  at a family gathering in 2013. According to an excerpt from a new biography of
  the disgraced Duke of York, published in the Daily Mail on Saturday, the pair
  had a heated argument that escalated into a physical altercation. “Punches
  were thrown over something Andrew said behind Harry’s back”, the author Andrew
  Lownie claimed. The alleged fight began when “Harry told [his uncle] he was a
  coward not to say it to his face. Harry got the better of Andrew by all
  accounts, leaving him with a bloody nose before the fight was broken up.”
  Lownie’s biography, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, also
  claims Andrew told his nephew that his marriage to Meghan Markle, now the
  Duchess of Sussex, would “not last more than a month”. He allegedly “accused
  Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding
  that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever,” and told his nephew he
  had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her
  past” before they got engaged in 2017. Late on Saturday, a spokesperson for
  Harry and Meghan said: “I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince Andrew have
  never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is
  alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.” The duke
  and duchess have sent a legal letter to the Daily Mail over the publication of
  what their spokesperson described as “gross inaccuracies, damaging and
  defamatory remarks”. The Guardian has approached Buckingham Palace and
  representatives for the Duke of York for comment. Prince Andrew fell from
  grace after a disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 about his friendship with
  Jeffrey Epstein, the late American financier and convicted sex offender. The
  duke was stripped of his royal and military titles in 2021. The book claims
  Harry and his brother, William, had “problematic” relationships with Andrew
  for years and that Andrew was also rude about William’s wife, Catherine, the
  Princess of Wales. King Charles has allowed his younger brother to stay in the
  Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park owned by the crown
  estate. However, last year the king ended Andrew’s allowance, estimated at £1m
  annually, raising questions about future arrangements. The source quoted in
  Lownie’s biography claims the Prince of Wales is keen to “evict” the duke and
  his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who lives with Andrew though the couple divorced
  in 1996. According to Entitled’s source, “[William] also loathes Sarah … and
  can’t wait for the day when his father throws them both out. If Charles
  doesn’t, I guarantee you the first thing William does when he becomes king is
  to get them evicted.” Harry broke ties with his family citing the “toxicity”
  of royal life and alleged racism towards his wife, moving with his young
  family to Canada and then the US in 2020. In 2022 he published a memoir,
  Spare, in which he detailed strains in his relationships with his father and
  brother. Earlier this year he told the BBC he had forgiven his family and
  would “love a reconciliation”.
