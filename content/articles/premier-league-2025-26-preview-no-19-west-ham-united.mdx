  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 15th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob
  Steinberg’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 14th Prospects The danger for West Ham is that this is the season
  when their dysfunction catches up with them. They have regressed since winning
  the Uefa Conference League two years ago, too many misguided moves preventing
  them from kicking on, and rebuilding has not been simple. Funds are tight
  after a series of costly errors in the transfer market and Graham Potter is
  yet to demonstrate he is capable of silencing the familiar sound of grumbling
  at the London Stadium. Some fans fear a relegation battle beckons. West Ham
  underwhelmed last season, attempts to move on from David Moyes’s pragmatism by
  replacing the Scot with Julen Lopetegui proving predictably short-lived. They
  finished 14th, their improvement marginal after Potter replaced Lopetegui in
  January, a subsequent run of five wins in 19 games telling its own story. The
  optimistic reading, though, is that this is the real start of the Potter era.
  The message was to judge him after a pre-season. Potter, who is expected to
  favour a 3-4-2-1 system, has worked on improving the team’s mentality. He
  wants more leadership. It is not a surprise that Potter has brought in a
  sports psychologist. The mood has also been lifted by Lucas Paquetá, the
  influential Brazilian midfielder, being found innocent of breaking betting
  regulations. Paquetá has impressed during pre-season. Jarrod Bowen, the
  captain, continues to deliver in attack and has shown signs of a productive
  partnership with Niclas Füllkrug. There have been some encouraging additions,
  El Hadji Malick Diouf in particular catching the eye at left wing-back in
  pre-season. Potter and Kyle Macaulay, the head of recruitment, won a little
  battle when they convinced the board to buy the Leicester goalkeeper Mads
  Hermansen. Callum Wilson, signed on a cheap short-term deal, offers
  experienced cover up front – if he can stay fit. More signings are required,
  though. Several veterans have departed, the sale of Mohammed Kudus to
  Tottenham leaves a creative deficit and Potter’s hopes of making West Ham more
  proactive at home and better in possession will depend on whether the club can
  deliver a No 6 and a No 8. A lot remains up in the air. The picture will be
  clearer when the window shuts. The manager Potter’s reputation is yet to
  recover after his brutal, ill-fated stint at Chelsea. Feted as the brightest
  young English coach around when he was at Brighton, it took only seven
  traumatic months at Stamford Bridge to throw his promising career off course.
  Now the challenge is to prove the doubters wrong. West Ham were unsure about
  hiring Potter but may benefit from his calm, dignity and ability to improve
  players on the training ground. Patience could be key. Potter is not about
  instant success. He has tended to build slowly, so West Ham will need to trust
  him if they start slowly. Off-field picture Concerns over profitability and
  sustainability rules meant West Ham had to sell to buy at the start of the
  window. Supporters, though, do not want to hear the club pleading poverty.
  Many still begrudge the move to the unloved London Stadium which, despite
  having a capacity of 62,500, has hardly led to a change in West Ham’s
  fortunes. David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, is heavily criticised. The
  76-year-old is not popular but remains highly influential. Less is made of the
  part played by the Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who bought his stake in
  2021. The Gold family put a proportion of their stake up for sale almost two
  years ago. Star signing West Ham tracked Diouf for more than a year but
  decided against moving for him last summer. Tim Steidten, the then technical
  director, is understood to have felt the Senegal international was not good
  enough for the Premier League. It is just as well, then, that the overhyped
  Steidten left last February. West Ham looked at Diouf again – they needed a
  left-back after releasing Aaron Cresswell and putting Emerson Palmieri up for
  sale – and took the plunge. They paid £22m for the 20-year-old, who was
  excellent in Senegal’s win over England in June, and are excited about his
  crossing ability. Stepping up There were high hopes for George Earthy after a
  productive season on loan at Bristol City. However the attacking midfielder
  sustained an ankle ligament injury at the start of pre-season and is still on
  the mend. Earthy will hope to press his claim once he returns but in the
  meantime all eyes are on Freddie Potts, who has done well in pre-season. The
  21-year-old, the son of the former West Ham defender Steve Potts, is a
  deep-lying midfielder and has looked comfortable on the ball in recent
  friendlies. Ollie Scarles, a 19-year-old left-back, will also hope for more
  minutes after being given opportunities last season. A big season for … The
  departure of Kudus means there will be pressure on Crysencio Summerville to
  step up and nail down a starting spot when he returns from a hamstring injury.
  The 23-year-old joined from Leeds last summer but the winger is yet to produce
  his best form for West Ham. He was a bit-part player under Lopetegui, who was
  reluctant to use the Dutchman’s speed and trickery, and has been out since
  tearing a hamstring during Potter’s first game. Surgery eventually followed
  and has left Summerville, who is expected to return next month, desperate to
  show what he can do. “When I’m back, it’s going to be showtime,” he said last
  month.
