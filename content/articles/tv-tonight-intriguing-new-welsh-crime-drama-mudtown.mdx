  Mudtown 9pm, U&amp;Alibi Another week, another introduction to a
  straight-talking crimefighter – but this one seems genuinely refreshing.
  Claire Jones (Erin Richards) is a working mother who is studying at night
  school and volunteering as a magistrate in Newport, south Wales. But when a
  family friend is charged with arson, Jones’s reputation in the community is
  rocked. Worse still, a local criminal with whom she shares a history is back
  on the scene. Hollie Richardson MasterChef 8pm, BBC One It’s week three of
  this slimmers’ MasterChef – served without the usual side of oily banter – and
  the home cooks are hoping to make it to the quarter-final. First, by turning a
  basic ingredient, such as cod or hazelnuts, into a standout dish. Then, by
  feeding 2022 champion Eddie Scott, who is is hungry to taste the best
  two-course menus. Ellen E Jones George Clarke’s Kitchen v Garden 8pm, Channel
  4 One-of-a-kind kitchen or dream Mediterranean garden? Property developer
  George and trusty garden designer Luke Millard put the question to a couple in
  Exmouth this week, along with their design proposals. The winning one gets a
  big cash injection. HR Destination X 9pm, BBC One The elaborate continental
  guessing game hosted by Rob Brydon continues, as the increasingly fractious
  passengers on the coach with blacked-out windows leave Venice behind to head
  for a new mystery destination. First, though, there’s a cliffhanger to
  resolve: surely they’re not all about to be arrested by angry Italian police?
  Jack Seale The Fortune Hotel 9pm, ITV1 Two new challenges see the contestants
  competing in the Can Tower Challenge, before a surprise twist all but upends
  alliances. Then, in Sink or Float, they must guess which objects will do one
  or the other when thrown into the pool. As contestant Fred says: “Power is
  knowledge. Er, no, I mean, knowledge is power.” Ali Catterall Amsterdam Narcos
  9pm, Sky Documentaries “I ended up buck-naked dancing on stage for six hours.”
  The series chronicling the dark side of Dutch drug culture examines the rapid
  rise of ecstasy in the 1980s via talking heads and dramatisations. If the
  early days were apparently full of peace and love, it did not take long for
  gangsters to throttle all the good vibes. Graeme Virtue
