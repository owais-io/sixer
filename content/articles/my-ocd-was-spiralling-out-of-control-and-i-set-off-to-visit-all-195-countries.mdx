  In May 2020, a month into the first Covid lockdown in Miami, Florida,
  20-year-old student Cameron Mofid found his obsessive-compulsive disorder
  (OCD) beginning to spiral out of control. “I was first diagnosed with the
  condition when I was 12. It produces obsessive thoughts that drive compulsions
  like washing hands, tapping or endlessly replaying conversations. When I was
  alone in the apartment with nowhere to go during Covid, those intrusive
  thoughts got much worse,” he says. “It can become paralysing being stuck in a
  mental loop. It was worrying and I felt like I really needed to get out of my
  head and that space.” With nothing else to do, Mofid began searching through
  travel destinations on his laptop, hoping for a near future where borders
  would reopen and he could leave. As he scrolled, he came across a fact that
  would change his life. “I saw that more people had been to space than had
  visited all 195 countries in the world,” he says. “I was shocked that so few
  people – about 300 – had seen the world, and I also learned that, according to
  the travel platform and community, Nomad Mania, the age of the youngest person
  to visit every country at that time was 27. I wanted to do something
  impossible: I decided to beat that record.” The age of the holder of the
  Guinness World Record for the feat, at the time, was 21, but Mofid noticed
  that the Guinness World Records rules had allowed the use of airport transits
  to gain new border stamps, in lieu of actually spending time in each country.
  Mofid wanted to break the record according to the rules of Nomad Mania, which
  meant setting himself the extra challenge of not only leaving the airport in
  each country but also spending at least a few days there. Five years later, on
  6 April 2025, only a few weeks after his 25th birthday, Mofid crossed the
  finish line and claimed the record in Pyongyang, North Korea. He was one of
  the first foreigners to enter the country in six years, forming part of a
  delegation allowed into the city to run a marathon. “I couldn’t believe it was
  real,” he says. “There were 50,000 people in the stadium cheering us on and my
  adrenaline was so high that at one point I thought I might even win the race!”
  Speaking from his parents’ home in San Diego, California, where he has been
  living for the past four months since his return, Mofid sports a close-cropped
  beard and is full of energy and enthusiasm, despite describing how, during his
  five years spent travelling, he experienced everything from severe illness in
  Algeria to imprisonment in Djibouti, detainment in Afghanistan, and witnessed
  horrifying poverty in Nigeria. “It’s no exaggeration to say it’s been
  life-changing,” he says. “My OCD has been much better for it and I’ve
  witnessed the kindness in humanity, as well as the luck that sees some of us
  born into privilege and others into awful poverty. I now want to do something
  with the rest of my life that has purpose.” Growing up in the coastal
  neighbourhood of La Jolla, San Diego, Mofid was raised by Egyptian and Persian
  American parents who encouraged him to take an interest in the wider world. “I
  would play a game where my grandmother called out the names of countries and I
  had to find them on a world map we had in the garage,” he says. “I was
  fascinated by the world and became really interested in visiting places like
  Lesotho and Somalia – not the usual places a kid might end up on holiday.”
  While his parents would take him every year to Egypt, where his grandmother
  eventually relocated, it was actually through his love of tennis that Mofid
  started travelling more widely. Training as a promising junior player, he
  achieved an international ranking and at 17 moved to Naples, Florida to join a
  tennis academy. It was there that he broke his elbow and, after two surgeries,
  was forced to retire from the game at 18. Faced without a future in the sport,
  Mofid decided to spend a gap year writing about tournaments for Florida Tennis
  magazine. “I spent that year covering professional tournaments in cities like
  Hong Kong, Marrakech, Milan, London and Singapore, and it was the first time I
  felt something shift in me,” he says. “Travel gave me a kind of escape from my
  OCD. I was breaking away from stressful situations in my mind and exploring
  new environments that my OCD hadn’t seeped into. I didn’t feel trapped in the
  same way.” Once he returned and enrolled at the University of Miami in 2019,
  Mofid continued to travel, as an escape from his OCD symptoms and the confines
  of his dorm room. He began working nights as a club promoter in Miami, selling
  entry tickets and packages to partygoers, to fund weekend trips to Guatemala,
  Belize, El Salvador and Nicaragua. By the time the world ground to a halt
  during Covid, he estimates he had already been to 50 countries. Still, if he
  was to beat the record for visiting every nation in the world, there was
  planning to be done and money to be made – in order to reach the other 145
  locations. He took extra credits at college so he could graduate earlier,
  while he expanded his freelance club-promoting into a nightlife business,
  holding events around the city. “I was at college in the day and then working
  nights, often until 4am, scanning tickets and dealing with drunk
  21-year-olds,” he says. “In March, during spring break, we had 30 events in a
  row. I was exhausted but it was worth it to fund my trip.” By December 2022,
  Mofid had completed his studies – including an MBA whittled down from two
  years to seven months – and had constructed a master spreadsheet of countries
  to visit, planned routes and airline costs. “My parents were worried about me
  going to places like Afghanistan and Iraq, but I took my last exam, packed my
  duffel bag and the next morning I flew out to Sudan,” he says with a smile. “I
  went to the ancient Nubian pyramids six hours from Khartoum, put on my
  graduation gown and got villagers to take pictures with me. I’d missed
  graduation back home but this was already so much more memorable.” Planning
  trips by region, Mofid spent the next two years veering between running his
  nightlife business in Miami and heading off for a month or two to tick off as
  many countries as possible on his list. “I would visit anything from seven to
  20 countries at once, planning everything meticulously to keep to a really
  tight budget. Usually, as soon as I got home from one trip, I was so excited
  I’d plan the next one the next morning,” he says. “The longest stint I went on
  was three months, which was my second to last trip. I started in Oman and then
  went to Iran, Dubai, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Russia, and then bussed
  and walked to Estonia.” When Mofid found out that air travel was suspended to
  Afghanistan while already en route through the United Arab Emirates, he had to
  enter via the notoriously dangerous Torkham border between Afghanistan and
  Pakistan. A local fixer encouraged him to dress in Afghan robes and to grow a
  beard in order to blend in, but he was immediately detained by Pakistani
  police on arrival, who were confused as to why an American citizen was
  disguising himself. “I was interrogated about my travels and tried to explain
  that I was just a tourist, not a spy, while in front of me another man was
  being whipped. It was terrifying,” he says. “Thankfully, I was released – and
  as soon as I crossed into Afghanistan, a member of the Taliban holding an
  enormous machine gun offered me tea.” In Djibouti, meanwhile, a market seller
  called the police after spotting him taking photos of the psychoactive
  substance khat. “Everyone surrounded me and I tried to talk my way out of it
  but I was taken straight to the local jail,” he says. “It was 43C (110F), they
  took my phone and I had a flight to catch that night. After half a day of
  waiting, the head of the national police arrived to interrogate me. Once they
  saw selfies of me at various locations they realised I was just a tourist and
  released me, but they told me to not come back.” While some might see these
  experiences as naive, Mofid is keen to emphasise the importance of what he has
  learned on his travels. “Travelling has made me so much more attuned to
  people’s stories and the complexities of what’s happening in the world,” he
  says. “Nothing is black and white, and we need to start treating migrants with
  humanity. People, at their core, are inherently good. In country after
  country, I was met with kindness. In Suriname, a man gave me shelter and a
  meal in his shack during a storm, and in Baghdad, everywhere I went, people
  offered me tea and hospitality, regardless of the fact that I am American.
  People who had almost nothing were willing to offer me everything; I realised
  that the more you travel, the more you realise how little you actually know.”
  In Nigeria, the 115th country he visited, Mofid spent time in the Makoko slum
  on the outskirts of Lagos, which is partly built on stilts over water. “It was
  the worst poverty I’ve ever seen, with more than 100,000 people living over
  sewage water,” he says. “Only 15% of kids in that section of Makoko go to
  school and they are totally cut off from the rest of the city. The one school
  we did visit, the teachers hadn’t been paid in months and most of the students
  lacked supplies. I decided I had to do something to help so I set up a
  GoFundMe.” Raising a few thousand dollars from fellow college students, Mofid
  was about to end the campaign in January 2023 when a donation for $45,000 came
  through from NBA player Kyrie Irving. “With that amount of money, I felt I had
  a responsibility to be a custodian,” he says. “I had been coming home between
  my trips and watching people drop $50,000 on a night out in Miami; that’s
  enough to fund an entire school in Makoko. It isn’t how the world should work.
  I left the business and the following month I founded the charity Humanity
  Effect as a way to support that community.” Two and a half years on, Mofid has
  completed the construction of a second school, built an orphanage for 40
  students and led a medical mission to Makoko. The charity is now his main
  focus. “Ninety per cent of our current circumstance in life is based on our
  birth, it’s the greatest luck we have,” he says. “These kids had bad luck and
  helping them is the thing in my life I’m most proud of.” Mofid also describes
  his OCD as “the best it’s ever been” since he began using his travels as
  exposure therapy to triggers such as dirt or unfamiliar social situations.
  “Through staying in places that were filled with worms or spiders or had no
  running water, I found the tools to manage it and reassure myself that I was
  OK,” he says. “Travelling can be very isolating and it taught me to be happy
  in my own company. Now, I can see OCD as my superpower, since it gives me a
  relentless curiosity – something that powered this mission to visit every
  country. I’m learning to accept it and live with it.” Mofid achieved his
  record, but it may already have been toppled. According to Nomad Mania, a
  23-year-old recently completed the round-the-world challenge. But Mofid
  believes the experience itself was worth the effort. “Travel teaches you the
  value of curiosity and empathy, and there are plenty of places I’d like to go
  back to and explore more thoughtfully,” he says. “Top of the list is Japan and
  then probably Iraq. First, though, I’ve never been to New York, so there is
  still plenty to see at home, and lots of time now to get there.”
