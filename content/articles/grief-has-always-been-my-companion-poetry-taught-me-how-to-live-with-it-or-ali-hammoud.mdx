  I have been well-acquainted with grief. As a Shiʿi Muslim, it permeates my
  religious consciousness and finds expression through annual mourning rituals.
  I find nourishment in mourning: from a young age I have lent my ears to
  lamentations and shed tears for martyrs felled in far-off lands. Recently
  though, grief, paid a more personal visit when news reached me of my
  grandmother’s passing. In response, I turned to my favourite poem, Lord
  Tennyson’s In Memoriam A. H. H., which ranks among the most profound and
  poignant elegies ever penned, in any language. Tennyson’s words are a balm for
  the soul, but some passages caught my eye for a different reason: I sometimes
  hold it half a sin To put in words the grief I feel; For words, like Nature,
  half reveal And half conceal the Soul within. But, for the unquiet heart and
  brain, A use in measured language lies; The sad mechanic exercise, Like dull
  narcotics, numbing pain. I was taken aback, for Tennyson’s words cast doubt on
  the effectiveness of poetry to deal with grief. It made me question whether
  the solace I sought in poetry was real, or merely a superficial remedy that
  lacked any substance. This spurred serious reflection on my part on the
  purpose of poetry in confronting grief, ably assisted by The Penguin Book of
  Elegy, which helped refine my thought process. I present some of these
  reflections below. All poetry is, in a sense, elegiac, as it attempts to
  preserve or recall that which has been, or will be, devoured by death. In
  wrestling with death, poetry attempts to distil the panorama of human
  experience into words, though it will inevitably fall short in describing the
  emotions and experiences of the poet. Tennyson alluded to this in the above
  excerpt when he wrote that words “half conceal the Soul within”. That is only
  half the picture, though, for Tennyson also conceded that words “half reveal”.
  It is in this tension that much of the beauty of poetry resides: it causes us
  to simultaneously hope and despair; urges us hold on and let go; and emboldens
  us to confront and flee from death. Poetry allows our hearts to hover in that
  mysterious realm that lies between life and death, to catch glimpses of our
  soul – for that part of us which yearns for something far greater than it.
  Words may not help us reach that which is beyond us, but they do help to
  reignite within us the innate desire to transcend ourselves. There is also
  something to be said for the role of poetry in transforming mourning from an
  individual into a communal experience. Poetry helps to unearth grief from one
  heart and plant it within the hearts of others; an individual pain is
  transformed into a shared sorrow. Words alone may not heal wounds, but I have
  found throughout my life that grief is easier to digest when it is shared.
  Tennyson’s own poem is proof of this: millions of readers have resonated with
  his words and perhaps found a degree of comfort and consolation that escaped
  Tennyson himself. A lone, pained voice of grief can feel meek before the
  shadow of death, but a symphony of sorrow orchestrated by hearts in sync can
  help soothe the grief. Some may read this and think I’ve overstated the
  significance of poetry in dealing with grief. This may be true, but I think we
  often fail to realise that words are magic: that with the assortment of
  letters cobbled together to form meaning, the emotions and thoughts that
  meander in our minds and hearts can flutter towards the minds and hearts of
  others. When we grieve, we mourn the most precious things that we have lost.
  But poetry helps us to not only preserve them, but to transform them: in
  allowing loss to sing, that which we have lost becomes beautiful and sublime,
  alive in ways we can only half comprehend. Ali Hammoud is a PhD candidate at
  Western Sydney University. He is broadly interested in Shīʿīsm and Islamicate
  intellectual history. More of his writings can be found on his Substack page
