  Robert Meldrum stalks the stage of the Explosives Factory in St Kilda in a
  long coat and hat, bewildered and buffeted by a lifetime of memories,
  grappling with grief and attrition in a dimming and desolate landscape. He’s
  not suffering from any loss of faculties; he’s simply an actor inhabiting the
  world of Samuel Beckett. Meldrum and his director and longtime collaborator,
  Richard Murphet (both in their mid-70s), are preparing to open Still, a
  compendium of six monologues cobbled from the Irish writer’s later works.
  While it speaks to universal themes of resilience and despair, it also
  captures the experience of any ageing actor who puts their body through the
  nightly rigours of stage work. As Beckett says in his 1953 novel The
  Unnamable, “ … you must go on. I can’t go on. I’ll go on.” “I don’t think I
  could in any way have done this in my 20s,” says Meldrum. “My ability to be
  completely still and present enables me to go into this work in a way I
  couldn’t before.” Murphet agrees, adding that Beckett’s “understanding of age
  and of maturity, the wealth of experience laid on top of you, is really deep.
  I sense it would be very difficult for a young person to do this.” Sign up for
  our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every
  Saturday morning As a culture we tend to talk about ageing as a series of
  losses, a whittling away of vigour and ability, but talking to actors in the
  latter part of their career reveals something more complex and moving. Apart
  from obvious issues with mobility and strength (Meldrum jokingly mentions
  “walking around and going up and down stairs” as areas of difficulty), these
  performers feel freer and more focused than ever. “I feel I’m performing the
  best I’ve ever performed,” Meldrum says. “As far as the idea of age slowing
  you down, it’s been a positive for me because I’ve always been a bit speedy.”
  Working with young actors as a lecturer at Victorian College of the Arts and
  now at the National Theatre, he notes the biggest challenge “is getting them
  to be still, not to constantly think ahead. It’s huge. Maybe it takes a
  lifetime?” Evelyn Krape has experienced something of a career renaissance
  lately, wowing audiences in Kadimah Yiddish Theatre’s production of Yentl,
  playing an ancient mischievous spirit – an irrepressible agent of chaos
  scampering up ladders and jumping on beds. She also recently finished a run in
  Tom Gleisner and Katie Weston’s musical Bloom, carrying the emotional stakes
  of the show as a vibrant, colourful woman coming to the end of her life in a
  soulless nursing home. The latter is a rare naturalistic, age-appropriate role
  for 76-year-old Krape, who has specialised in a more freewheeling and
  vaudevillian performance style, notably in the plays of her late husband Jack
  Hibberd. “I’ve never really played my age. In Dimboola I played a
  nine-year-old girl. At 21, I played Granny Hills in the Hills Family Show,
  where I had thick knitting yarn sewn in between two stockings to give me
  varicose veins.” At 61, actor and cabaret legend Paul Capsis is younger than
  Krape and Meldrum, but after the recent death of his mother he’s found himself
  thinking about second acts and what his might look like. “If anything, I’m
  planning on being crazier and more debauched,” he jokes over the phone from
  Lisbon, where he’s having a break before starting rehearsals for Sydney
  Theatre Company’s upcoming production of The Shiralee. “Because I don’t feel
  any different, you know? I still think I’m 35 – and then my body goes ‘Oh hell
  no, bitch!’” Capsis doesn’t necessarily place restrictions on himself as a
  performer these days, but he does want more agency over certain conditions.
  “I’ve turned down gigs because they were asking me to sing in that
  countertenor range, and I just don’t want to do that to my voice any more. I’m
  also much more interested in a director’s process. I want to know as much as I
  can before going in.” While fear – of forgetting lines or blocking, or folding
  under the pressures of a long run – can increase with age, so too does
  confidence in one’s skills. “I feel more certain about myself as a performer,”
  Krape says. “I’m not afraid to really go for things and if they work, they
  work. If they don’t, you try something else.” All the actors Guardian spoke
  with mentioned wanting more time in the rehearsal room. Most commercial
  theatre productions have a three-week rehearsal period, “which is not enough”,
  says Capsis. “Not nearly enough.” “A gift for an actor is a second or third
  season,” says Krape. “Because you can’t help but scratch the surface the first
  time. If you don’t get that time to really play, things are more token and
  superficial.” Meldrum and Murphet extended their rehearsal process over an
  entire year. It’s a method drawn from famed European theatre companies such as
  Berlin’s Schaubühne or Peter Brook’s Bouffes du Nord, where rehearsal periods
  are ongoing and open-ended. “There was no time frame [for Still],” says
  Meldrum. “We just worked until it was ready.” Of course, financial constraints
  mean this type of deep exploration is rare. Most actors in Australia, even at
  the pointy ends of their careers, work hand to mouth and can’t afford to
  luxuriate over roles. Retirement seems almost unthinkable. “There’s still so
  much I want to do. I hope not to have to retire,” says Krape. Meldrum is
  blunter: “I can’t afford to retire.” Why even countenance the idea when the
  work is so rewarding and the contributions these actors make are so vitalising
  for an industry often transfixed by youth? Murphet says the work “keeps me
  alive, it keeps me energised. And if I wasn’t doing it, then I would slip into
  senility. So I can’t say that there’s anything about it that makes me feel
  old, because there isn’t.”
