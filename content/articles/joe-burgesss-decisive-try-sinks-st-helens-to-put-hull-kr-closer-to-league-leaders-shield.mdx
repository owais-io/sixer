  With the nights drawing in and the temperatures starting to drop, it is
  already starting to feel like playoff season is just around the corner in
  Super League. But this match only reinforced it further as two sides with
  aspirations of reaching the Grand Final in October played out an absorbing
  dress-rehearsal for what is to come over the next six weeks. In the end, it
  was Hull KR who secured victory – and deservedly. Willie Peters’ side now know
  that victory next week will clinch a first League Leaders’ Shield in the Super
  League for the Robins, as well as leg two of what could be a historic treble.
  Their opponents next Sunday? Their arch rivals Hull FC. They certainly had to
  work hard for their latest victory in a meeting of Super League’s two best
  defensive sides. For large periods it looked as though the whole 80 minutes
  would pass without a try being scored. However, when one finally came it
  proved crucial, as Joe Burgess’s finish secured the points for Hull KR. Having
  been badly beaten at Leeds last weekend, this was the kind of response you
  would expect from a side that have been so dominant all season. They took
  their moments when they arrived, and were brilliant without the ball to move
  one step closer to another piece of history, having won the Challenge Cup for
  the first time in 45 years earlier this summer. “It was a good game. It had a
  semi-finals feel and it got a bit edgy at the end, but it was a good game,”
  Peters said. He was not wrong; this was a mesmerising encounter, in which both
  teams could muster up only a solitary penalty apiece by half-time as defences
  dominated. Both teams even survived 10 minutes without a player, as Rhyse
  Martin was sin-binned for Hull KR before George Delaney followed suit for the
  Saints. Crucially though, Martin’s tackle on Morgan Knowles after seven
  minutes ended the England international’s evening, and left the visitors
  without their most influential player for most of the night. Saints have shown
  huge improvement since they were hammered here earlier in the season. A run of
  nine wins in 10 meant they could have gone second with a win, but now they
  could be fifth by the end of the weekend. They have taken steps forward, but
  this showed they are still a fraction behind the very best sides. “The way we
  started the second half was poor,” their coach, Paul Wellens, said. “When you
  come here, it’s often an attritional battle and the way we started that second
  half, we were in trouble early.” Penalties from Martin and Mark Percival left
  it finely poised at 2-2 at the break, before the boot of Martin came into play
  again after the restart. As Wellens admitted, Saints’ discipline cost them in
  the second half. They were still holding Rovers’ attack at bay quite
  comfortably but three separate penalties gave Martin easy opportunities to
  open up a six-point lead. On a night when defences were firmly on top, that
  felt crucial. So too did Mikey Lewis’s pinpoint 40-20, which gave the Robins a
  chance to strike, and they finally opened the Saints up when Burgess finished
  a wonderful move in the corner to make it 12-2. To the visitors’ credit, they
  set up a grandstand finale when Deon Cross touched down in the corner, but
  they ran out of time. It means that while there are unanswered questions over
  this St Helens side’s ability to go the distance, Rovers are now only 80
  minutes away from another piece of silverware.
