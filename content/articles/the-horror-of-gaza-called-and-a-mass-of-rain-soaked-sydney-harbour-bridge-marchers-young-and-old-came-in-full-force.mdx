  They came in full force in the pouring rain, armed with umbrellas and ponchos
  and waterproof prams. One man even carried a surfboard. This is Sydney, after
  all. At least 100,000 people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on
  Sunday as part of a growing global call for a ceasefire in Gaza. It was double
  the estimated turnout, and described by New South Wales police as the largest
  protest to descend on the city in memory. Organisers estimated up to 300,000
  walked. The massive column of rain-soaked marchers snaked their way across the
  entire 1.2km length of the bridge. Police temporarily ordered a halt over
  fears of a crowd crush because of the “huge number of people taking part”. On
  Saturday, after the NSW supreme court had ruled in favour of the march
  proceeding, the Palestine Action Group had crystal ball gazed and said
  Sunday’s bridge crossing would be an “immense march for humanity”. The group
  has held a march every Sunday since 7 October 2023. But this was the first
  time it had taken its rally to Sydney’s world-famous landmark, last closed for
  public assembly in 2023 for World Pride. To regulars of those weekly
  gatherings, Sunday felt like a tidal wave. Ali, marching with his wife and
  young daughter, described it as “history in the making”. “This is a big
  moment,” Ali said, as his eight-year-old daughter, Aaliyah, sat on his
  shoulders calling out “Free Palestine”, her cheeks painted in black, red,
  white and green. “The people shut down the Harbour Bridge – the people did
  it.” But eventually, as scores of mobile phones buzzed on the bridge, the
  people were turned back. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Police orders were
  delivered to the masses via periodic text messages as helicopters circled
  overhead. The first read: “The march needs to stop due to public safety.”
  Later, protesters were told to stop walking north and return back to the
  central business district. The marchers took it all in their stride: everyone
  was already drenched. As the crowd began to turn around, a child stood on a
  pillar, leading a chant: “In our thousands, in our millions, we are all
  Palestinians.” The boy was among hundreds of infants and children in
  attendance. Many brandished homemade signs and banged empty pots and pans. The
  clanging of metal was meant to signify the ongoing starvation in Gaza. Maila,
  a year 5 student, said she would describe Sunday’s crowd to her own children
  one day. “I’m speaking out for the Palestinian kids like me, and for all of
  Palestine because of the war that’s been going on right now,” she said, her
  hair adorned with a keffiyeh. Despite the torrential rain and significant
  transport delays, spirits remained high. Volunteers in fluorescent hi-vis
  vests directed protesters away from puddles that had amassed on the concrete.
  Each time a train whistled past, marchers on the bridge, which links the north
  and south sides of the city, erupted into cheers and whistles, singing “Free,
  free Palestine” to passengers going past. Tourists summiting the bridge’s
  1,332 steps waved down from its steel arched peak, witnesses to an unfolding
  moment in history that the state’s premier, Chris Minns, had tried to stop.
  The NSW police acting deputy commissioner Peter McKenna described the protest
  as the largest he’d seen in his time in the force in Sydney. “Gee whiz, I
  wouldn’t like to try and do this every Sunday,” he said. “We’re very lucky
  today that the crowd was well behaved.” At the front of the march,several
  high-profile Australians, including Julian Assange, held a sign that read
  “March for Humanity Save Gaza”. Five NSW Labor MPs were alongside Assange,
  defying their premier. Two of Minns’ ministers were there too: Penny Sharpe
  and Jihad Dib. The federal Labor MP Ed Husic – dumped from the Albanese
  cabinet in May – was in the crowd. Husic reiterated calls for the Albanese
  government to sanction Israel and recognise Palestinian statehood. “People
  power has come out, I think, largely because they just cannot abide the
  treatment that has been seen of little kids,” he said. Abib, in the crowd,
  agreed. She marched across the bridge carrying a Palestinian flag alongside
  her daughter. She said it was “humanity” that had brought marchers out in what
  was truly atrocious weather. “I think a lot of people are starting to wake
  up,” she said. “We’re going on two years [of war]. People that were quiet in
  the beginning have started to speak.” Abib, whose husband is Palestinian, was
  struck by the diversity of people. Middle-aged women carried a banner
  crocheted by volunteers. Elderly couples completed the 4km journey on walking
  sticks. A group of British men held a sign reading “Gay Jews 4 Gaza”. As the
  day began to wind down, Josh Lees, one the main organisers of a march that
  will be long remembered, told Guardian Australia: “It’s even bigger than my
  wildest dreams. “It’s a mass march for humanity to stop a genocide, our
  politicians have to now listen to the will of the people and sanction Israel.”
