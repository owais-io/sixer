  A recent study examined the potential link between hearing loss and dementia,
  suggesting that treating hearing loss can help the brain. Although the
  possible connection is still being untangled, study co-author and audiologist
  Nicholas Reed advises prioritizing hearing health regardless. “There are
  already more than enough established benefits related to hearing care,” says
  Reed, a faculty member of the NYU Langone Health Optimal Aging Institute.
  What’s especially important about supporting hearing health is the effect it
  has on keeping people engaged in the world, Reed explains. Here’s what experts
  recommend in order to support your hearing as you age. How does hearing loss
  occur? Hearing loss can result from a wide range of genetic and environmental
  factors, such as chronic diseases and smoking. Some also experience
  age-related hearing loss, called presbycusis. Hearing loss is “not about
  volume”, Reed explains. Instead, it’s a clarity issue. We lose our hearing at
  different frequencies at different rates, which can make sounds garbled. There
  is a tendency to “normalize hearing loss as we age to some extent”, says Reed.
  Other conditions can seem more pressing, and hearing loss becomes a low
  priority. There can be “downstream effects” in a healthcare context because
  hearing loss can hinder patient-provider communication, says Reed. What is the
  relationship between hearing loss and dementia? Early research suggests that
  hearing loss is associated with increased cognitive decline and an increased
  risk of new cases of dementia, although further studies are needed to
  understand this connection. Researchers have not, however, found a
  cause-and-effect relationship between hearing loss and dementia. Reed and his
  colleagues wanted to calculate the number of cases of dementia there could be
  in a population if a potential risk factor, in this case hearing loss, was
  eliminated. They used a sample of nearly 3,000 adults aged 66 to 90 and found
  32% of the dementia risk in the sample group was potentially associated with
  audiometric hearing loss (hearing loss measured through testing). According to
  the authors, these results suggest that treating hearing loss may delay the
  onset of dementia in some older adults. However, this research cannot
  establish whether hearing loss causes dementia, explains co-author Jason
  Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina. One
  potential reason hearing loss is associated with cognitive changes is that it
  can lead to more social isolation, which may strain the brain and affect
  memory, says Reed. Another theory is that because auditory signals stimulate
  the brain, the lack of stimulation caused by hearing loss can lead to
  accelerated brain atrophy. If hearing problems are linked to an increased risk
  of dementia, are there ways to reduce that risk? An influential 2020 Lancet
  report recommended the use of hearing aids and protecting ears from excessive
  noise exposure. A 2023 analysis found a connection between the use of devices
  like hearing aids and a decreased risk of cognitive decline. However, further
  research is needed. What can you do to prevent hearing loss? Hearing loss is
  not an inevitable part of ageing. But certain factors, such as age-related
  changes to the inner ear and auditory nerve, as well as genetics, are beyond
  our control. We can still mitigate the likelihood of damage from other causes.
  For example, we can manage conditions associated with hearing loss, such as
  high blood pressure and diabetes. We can also limit exposure to sources of
  damaging noise, like construction equipment, lawn mowers, motorcycles and loud
  music. Small actions, like protecting your hearing at a loud concert with
  over-ear headphones, which Reed prefers to earplugs, can have a big impact. “A
  healthy lifestyle and healthy listening habits can go a long way,” says Reed.
  Reed also recommends that people start getting their hearing tested in their
  late 30s or 40s. Establishing a baseline can help you identify changes over
  time, and indicate if and when new habits might be useful. The longer you live
  with impaired hearing, the harder it is to adjust to tools like hearing aids.
  Is it possible to reverse hearing loss? Several treatments and devices can
  help alleviate hearing loss, but their effectiveness depends on the
  individual. If you suspect you have hearing issues, it’s best to have your
  hearing checked and discuss options with your healthcare provider. Hearing
  aids can be purchased over-the-counter or with a prescription. Reed says
  learning how to wear them takes time and practice. There’s a critical public
  health need to expand coverage for these tools, says Smith, because it’s
  well-established that hearing aids can improve quality of life. While studies
  haven’t proven that hearing aids will delay dementia, scientists are intrigued
  by their potential to support brain health. “The idea is that, in theory, if a
  person uses hearing aids, communication becomes easier and you lower the
  burden of cognitive load,” says Reed. “You’re stimulating the brain with more
  auditory signals.” Staying engaged in social networks is key to maintaining
  mental and physical wellbeing, says Reed. In a 2025 study, Reed and colleagues
  found that, among people with hearing loss, participants who received hearing
  aids and were counseled on their use experienced less loneliness and social
  isolation. They also had more varied types of connections, such as friends,
  family and acquaintances. Similarly, assistive technologies may help. These
  range widely in function and design, but generally amplify sound, reduce
  background noise, and improve communication. For example, apps that convert
  speech to text can assist with phone calls, and personal amplifiers can
  enhance hearing in conversations. People with mild to moderate hearing loss
  may find some relief in settings like crowded restaurants through items like
  the Apple AirPods Pro 2, which feature a built-in hearing aid, says Reed. In
  some instances, what can help a person manage hearing loss best is how they
  are supported by their community. There’s a need for more equitable
  environments that support people with sensory health needs, says Smith. “Some
  communication tips can go really far,” says Reed. “Good communication is
  looking someone in the face. It’s speaking slowly. It’s about rephrasing and
  adding context.”
