  rapist Gareth Ward delayed by supreme court

  Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward will face an urgent court hearing on Thursday
  after he sought an injunction to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling
  him from the New South Wales parliament. The Minns government on Tuesday
  sought the hearing in the state’s supreme court to lift an ex parte injunction
  granted the previous day to Ward. The injunction prevents parliament, until at
  least Thursday, from moving to expel the member for Kiama. Ward commenced the
  proceedings on Monday night via his lawyers from Silverwater jail, where he
  has been remanded pending sentencing in September. Ward has said he will
  appeal his July criminal convictions on three counts of indecent assault and
  one for sexual intercourse without consent involving two young men in
  incidents that occurred in 2013 and 2015. The parliament faced a potential
  constitutional showdown with the state’s supreme court after the leader of the
  Legislative Assembly, Ron Hoenig, told reporters the government did not
  believe the court had the constitutional power to restrain the parliament or
  any member from moving a motion in the lower house. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email However, “out of respect for the court”, the parliament would apply for
  a more urgent hearing date, when it would seek to have the injunction lifted,
  Hoenig said on Tuesday morning. The application for the hearing was put before
  the president of the court of appeal, justice Julie Ward, at midday. She
  deemed that the matter should be brought forward by a day and heard by the
  court of appeal on Thursday. She offered to bring it forward to Wednesday if
  that suited both parties. However, Ward’s barrister, Peter King, said getting
  instructions from Ward promptly was a challenge, given he was remanded in
  custody in the Hunter Valley. King also noted that an earlier date could
  interfere with his mother’s 95th birthday. “You’re the ones that have invoked
  the jurisdiction of the court,” Ward replied. “Ordinarily, one would not
  expect the matter would be going on for a long time.” Justice Deborah Sweeney,
  the duty judge in the supreme court, granted Ward the initial injunction on
  Monday night after the government notified the MP and his lawyers of Tuesday’s
  proposed motion to expel him. He was invited to submit any arguments to the
  parliament. The government did not have an opportunity to make submissions to
  the court on Monday night. Hoenig told reporters on Tuesday morning that the
  scheduled hearing on Friday was too late, because the parliament was due to
  rise then and would need to be recalled if Ward’s injunction was not dealt
  with more swiftly. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has made it clear Ward should
  resign – or the government would remove him via an expulsion motion. “We’ve
  got a week of parliament to sit, and I think that most people would
  appreciate, it’s an unconscionable situation to have someone who’s currently
  sitting in jail in Silverwater, convicted of serious sexual offences, who is
  demanding to remain a member of parliament and continue to be paid,” Minns
  told 2GB radio on Tuesday. Ward’s conviction has plunged the NSW parliament
  into uncharted territory. As an independent member, he has not been under the
  usual pressure to resign from a political party. Therefore, the parliament was
  having to rely on a little-used inherent power to protect itself if the
  conduct of a member could damage the integrity of the parliament and endanger
  its proper functioning. The government had planned to begin moves to expel
  Ward on Tuesday, with a vote expected on Wednesday. The opposition leader,
  Mark Speakman, said the Coalition would support the government seeking Ward’s
  expulsion. “Every day he clings to his seat from a jail cell, taxpayers are
  footing the bill, and the people of Kiama are left voiceless. It’s not just
  wrong, it’s offensive,” Speakman said on Tuesday. In 2021, Ward left the
  Liberal party and moved to the crossbench after identifying himself as the
  state MP under investigation by the child abuse and sex crimes squad. When
  charges were laid in March 2022, the then NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet,
  called for his resignation. Later that month, Ward was suspended after a
  motion unanimously passed the Legislative Assembly. In August 2022, Ward was
  committed to stand trial. But Ward’s voters in the south coast state seat of
  Kiama re-elected him in March 2023 and he returned to Macquarie Street.
