  Newcastle are close to signing Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa for £40m after
  resisting competition from West Ham for the versatile 24-year-old midfielder.
  With talks between the clubs advanced, it is understood personal terms should
  not be a problem. If the deal proceeds as planned Ramsey could be in
  Newcastle’s squad on Saturday for the opening Premier League fixture at,
  coincidentally, Villa Park. Ramsey can operate anywhere across midfield and
  this will appeal to Eddie Howe as Newcastle’s manager seeks to fill the gap
  created by Sean Longstaff’s £15m departure for Leeds last month while
  preparing for a Champions League campaign. Although Ramsey often started on
  the Villa bench he scored 17 goals in 167 appearances for the club and started
  about half of last season’s games. He made his debut in 2019 and Howe has long
  been an admirer. Ramsey has also been the subject of serious interest from
  Tottenham and West Ham, the latter this summer. Villa were not actively trying
  to sell Ramsey, but his sale would rank as pure profit in terms of
  profitability and sustainability regulations. Ramsey’s sale would allow Unai
  Emery to strengthen, with a versatile centre-back and an attacking player
  priorities. Villa could resurrect a deal for the Toulouse teenager Jaydee
  Canvot. The Milan winger Alexis Saelemaekers has admirers at Villa, who could
  target the Paris Saint-Germain forward Marco Asensio after he spent the second
  half of last season on loan at the club. The expectation had been Villa would
  seek an alternative to Asensio. Newcastle have completed the £35m signing of
  the Germany central defender Malick Thiaw from Milan and remain in the market
  for two strikers. With their Sweden centre‑forward Alexander Isak continuing
  to agitate for a transfer to Liverpool and training separately from the rest
  of Howe’s squad, Newcastle are locked in tricky negotiations with Brentford
  over a move for Yoane Wissa. Brentford have turned down a £25m bid and
  demanded £40m from Newcastle for a player who turns 29 in September. It had
  been hoped a compromise would be reached this week but, with Howe having made
  clear Isak will not be involved against Villa, it looks as if the England
  winger Anthony Gordon will be fielded out of position at centre-forward on
  Saturday. Once Newcastle sign at least one new forward, Liverpool are expected
  to submit an improved bid for Isak. They have had a £110m offer rejected.
