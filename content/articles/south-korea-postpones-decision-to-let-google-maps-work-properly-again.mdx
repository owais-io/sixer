  For tourists visiting South Korea, one of the world’s most technologically
  advanced nations, navigating the country’s urban heartlands can prove
  surprisingly frustrating for one simple reason: Google Maps just doesn’t work
  effectively. That could change soon, as South Korean authorities discuss
  whether to finally grant Google’s request to export the country’s detailed
  mapping data to overseas servers. But a decision on the matter was postponed
  for a second time this year on Friday to allow for further review of security
  concerns. Such a move would open up functionality that allows the app to give
  detailed directions and show users the best routes to travel. It is a debate
  spanning nearly two decades which has evolved into a broader test of how
  democracies balance digital sovereignty with economic openness. Local industry
  groups are warning of market domination from foreign companies, while those
  who back Google’s request argue restrictions harm tourism and innovation.
  South Korea is one of only a handful of countries – alongside China and North
  Korea – in which Google Maps fails to function properly. While Google
  dominates online services in most of the world, South Korea’s digital
  landscape is instead controlled by local “portal” companies Naver and Kakao.
  These platforms provide comprehensive services including search engines,
  email, news, messaging, music and maps, creating a formidable ecosystem that
  has long resisted foreign tech dominance. The firms provide precise public
  mapping data but store it on domestic servers as required by law. Google
  already licenses the same data from a domestic provider but can use it only to
  display information like landmarks and local businesses – and, crucially,
  cannot provide directions for users. Security concerns and local opposition
  Google says it needs to distribute and process the data through its global
  server network to provide real-time navigation for billions of users
  worldwide, including those researching Korean destinations from abroad. The
  government has consistently refused, citing national security risks. However,
  Google argues that the mapping data it seeks has already undergone security
  review and had sensitive locations removed – and the same data is used by
  domestic competitors. Google has said it will blur satellite imagery of any
  sensitive facilities if required by authorities. Opposition to Google’s
  request is fierce. The Korean Association of Spatial Information, Surveying
  and Mapping (Kasm), which represents 2,600 local companies, reports 90%
  opposition from 239 member companies surveyed, fearing market domination by
  the US tech company. “The government must listen to industry concerns,” says
  Kim Seok-jong, chair of Kasm, warning of potential “industry devastation”.
  Critics also warn that approving the request could set a precedent for other
  foreign companies, particularly from China. Apple has also applied for similar
  permissions, according to local media reports. The government has offered an
  alternative, saying Google could access the detailed mapping data if it built
  local datacentres, as domestic competitors do, although this would still not
  resolve the issue of processing data on Google servers around the world. In
  2022, the vulnerability of such an approach came to light when one of Kakao’s
  datacentres caught fire, leaving millions without access to the company’s
  messaging, mapping and ride-hailing services. Tourism impact Korea Tourism
  Organisation data shows complaints increased 71% last year, with Google Maps
  accounting for 30% of all app-related grievances, primarily due to the
  non-functioning directions functionality. Francesco from Italy said he was
  “surprised” to find that Google Maps didn’t work well when he arrived in Seoul
  for a 1-week trip. “It’s just so annoying. I search for a reviewed restaurant
  on Google, then I have to switch to Naver Maps (a local app) just for the
  walking directions,” he said. “I heard it’s a security issue,” said Loic, a
  tourist from France. “But I feel it’s more about protecting local businesses.”
  The restrictions have also drawn criticism from tourism startups and tech
  advocates, who argue that without access to internationally standard mapping
  tools, they will struggle to build globally competitive services, stifling
  growth. Previous government reviews in 2007 and 2016 both resulted in
  rejection. This time, an inter-agency committee including defence and
  intelligence representatives has twice extended the deadline – first from May
  to August, then again to October – citing the need for deeper consultation
  with security agencies and industry stakeholders. The issue has featured in
  broader US-Korea trade tensions, with Washington’s trade office listing South
  Korea’s mapping restrictions as a “non-tariff trade barrier”. South Korea
  recently concluded trade negotiations that secured 15% tariffs rather than the
  initially threatened 25%, with President Lee Jae Myung scheduled to meet
  President Donald Trump at the White House in the coming days or weeks. South
  Korea’s transport ministry was unavailable for comment ahead of the decision.
  Google says its Maps software helps people “navigate and explore with
  confidence using fresh information about places, roads and traffic” and that
  it works closely with “local governments to make Maps helpful for locals and
  visitors”.
