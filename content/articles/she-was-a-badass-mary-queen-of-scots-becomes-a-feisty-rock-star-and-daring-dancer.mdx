  ‘It was a time of extraordinary violence,” says James Bonas. “There’s
  Elizabeth I deciding to have her cousin’s head chopped off, when her father
  had chopped her own mother’s head off! It’s incredible what they lived
  through.” The mother in question was, of course, Anne Boleyn, and the royal
  cousin losing her head was Mary, Queen of Scots, sent to the scaffold in 1587
  and now the subject of a ballet co-created by director Bonas and choreographer
  Sophie Laplane for Scottish Ballet, premiering at this year’s Edinburgh
  international festival. There are actually multiple festival shows revisiting
  Mary’s legacy in Edinburgh this summer, which all take different slants on the
  story of the girl who inherited the throne at just six days old, became queen
  consort of France as well as Scotland’s ruler, and was executed at the age of
  44. “I think she was a badass,” says Mhairi McCall, whose show Mary, Queen of
  Rock! reimagines Mary as a rock star (drawing on icons from Tina Turner to
  Stevie Nicks), who returns to Scotland from France to find that rock music has
  been outlawed in favour of pop (that’s your Catholics v Protestants there).
  For Rona Johnston, writer/performer of Mary: A Gig Theatre Show, Mary’s story
  is a tragedy: “She could have done so much more but she was torn down in her
  prime.” For Scottish Ballet’s own investigation into the myth of Mary, Laplane
  tells me: “We didn’t want to do a historical ballet.” The 16th century is
  definitely history, but what she means is they didn’t want to make something
  ploddingly factual, but rather dig into emotions and relationships, especially
  the one with Mary’s cousin, Elizabeth I. The story is told through Elizabeth’s
  memory and imagination as she lies on her deathbed, and it does sound like a
  bit of a fever dream: Mary’s baby, James, is represented by a balloon; young
  Queen Elizabeth appears on stilts; and Mary turns into a spider and eats her
  second husband, Lord Darnley. Reinvigorating narrative ballet is very much
  Scottish Ballet’s agenda. Its last festival premiere, the hugely successful
  Coppélia in 2022, turned a corny 19th-century piece into a cautionary tale of
  AI and tech bros. The idea for this new ballet has been in the works for
  several years, back when Nicola Sturgeon was still first minister, “and we
  didn’t know if we’d be knocking on the door of another independence
  referendum,” says Bonas, putting English/Scottish friction to the fore. The
  rollercoaster of political fortunes plays out in contemporary life just as it
  did in Mary’s time, with leaders lauded one moment, hunted the next. McCall’s
  rock show, with its feisty frontwoman, makes this point by drawing comparisons
  with women in the music industry. “We love to build up women in the media, to
  such a point that the only way for them to come is down, and we relish in
  their downfall,” she says. The rapport and rivalry between Scottish Queen Mary
  and English Queen Elizabeth has been fodder for myriad books, TV shows and
  films. “It’s always very stereotyped,” says Laplane. “Elizabeth is frustrated
  and neurotic, and then Mary is riding her horse in the wild with her hair
  loose. When we started digging into it, it was interesting to find out that
  Mary was many, many things.” “They’re always pitted against each other,” says
  Johnston. “And [in our show] we say the reason for that is because of the men
  in their lives, who were all power hungry.” After Mary’s first husband,
  Francis II, Dauphin of France, died, she married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley,
  who orchestrated the murder of Mary’s friend and secretary David Rizzio. Mary
  may or may not have been involved in the subsequent plot to kill Darnley, but
  she did marry the man thought to be responsible, the Earl of Bothwell. “She
  met a lot of bad men, bad male influences,” agrees McCall. “And she kind of
  got shot down every step of the way.” The Scottish lords then turned against
  Mary, and Elizabeth perceived her as a threat and had her imprisoned. For
  Johnston’s gig theatre show, she wanted to imagine a different landscape for
  the two women, where instead of competition and political paranoia there would
  have been sisterhood and solidarity, “imagining the two of them could have
  been partners in some way, rather than enemies”. McCall, too, wanted to go
  against “the age-old narrative of two women trying to tear each other down”.
  Surprisingly, Mary and Elizabeth never actually met. However, they exchanged
  hundreds of letters, with an intensity Bonas jokingly likens to someone who
  strikes up a pen-pal relationship with someone in prison and falls in love
  with them. “They were very intimate in the letters, calling each other ‘my
  sister’,” says Bonas. “They absolutely recognised each other as two ruling
  queens and had a concept of their power and what that meant, being two women
  at the top of patriarchal power structures, both very vulnerable, actually, in
  their own ways. Needing one another, but in rivalry.” Laplane adds: “They were
  the only ones who could understand each other’s situation.” Despite being a
  “dear sister”, Mary did ultimately plot against Elizabeth (although some
  dispute this), and Elizabeth did send Mary to her death. “But it took her a
  long time to get round to signing the death warrant,” insists Bonas.
  “[Elizabeth’s spymaster] Francis Walsingham pretty much had to force her into
  it in the end.” Bonas talks of the “stunt” Mary pulled at her execution,
  “where she turned up wearing black, and then she’s standing on the scaffold
  and whips it off, and she’s dressed in red. They understood their own brands.
  They were aware of their own political and cultural identities.” All of which
  makes them fascinating characters to keep exploring on stage. For Bonas, Mary
  was “proud and strong and determined and passionate, but she was as much of a
  political actor as Elizabeth. She’s iconic, she’s emblematic of Scottishness,
  but telling the story through Elizabeth gave us a chance to investigate
  English guilt.” (Bonas is English, with a Scottish mother; Laplane, like Mary,
  has French and British parentage.) The atmosphere of political instability,
  and the sense of nowhere and no one being safe is something Laplane wanted to
  capture in the choreography, with a cast of shadowy figures ramping up the
  paranoia. She has brought her characteristic dance language to the work, full
  of sharp precision, detail and wit (as seen in previous works including
  Dextera, Click! (made for Ballet Black), and the film Dive, also co-created
  with Bonas). In her depiction of the three courts, Laplane finds humour amid
  the history. In the French court, she weaves in historical dance styles with a
  sense of refinement, but the men all have portly bellies (“Because back in the
  day, if you were rich, you ate a lot!”); in the English court, to show how
  stratified society was, she has Elizabeth rising up on stilts while the men
  all shuffle around her on their knees. The Scottish court was more horizontal,
  with genders mixing and more access to the queen, so they tried “to find that
  sense of community in the movement”, explains Bonas, “without just doing
  country dancing”. The score for the ballet is by Mikael Karlsson and Michael P
  Atkinson, who also wrote the music for Coppélia, mixing period and modern
  sounds. And the designs are by Soutra Gilmour (Evita, Sunset Boulevard),
  referencing fashion designers who themselves used historical motifs, such as
  Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. Cultural references bounce back and
  forth, with the aim of collapsing the five centuries between now and then, and
  synthesising eras – just as ballet itself does as an art form, forged in the
  Italian and French courts and now continually remade for the modern day, but
  always in touch with its roots. The aim is to help us see these distant
  figures as flesh-and-blood women. Bonas’s question is always: “How can you
  re-experience these characters in a way that makes them feel like people? How
  do you get them off the page?” Johnston says she easily connected to Mary when
  she started reading about her. “She was sort of my age, in her 20s, when she
  was in charge of Scotland. You see quotes about how fun she was and how much
  people loved her.” McCall was drawn to the fact that there’s still so much we
  don’t know. “Did she intentionally betray Elizabeth and turn against her? Was
  she pushed into that? Was she completely innocent? We’ll never really know for
  sure what she thought, what she felt. Mary’s a great example of somebody who
  tried to do the right thing at every turn and was just set up to fail. I like
  to believe she thought: ‘I’ve tried to do everything right [but when it went
  against her], I may as well just go down the wrong path now!’ And I love her
  as a person for that.” • Mary, Queen of Scots is at Festival theatre, 15-17
  August; Mary: A Gig Theatre Show is at Gilded Balloon Patter House, 14-21
  August; Mary, Queen of Rock! is at Cowbarn at Underbelly, Bristo Square until
