  Big hands might mean big feet, but it seems long thumbs are linked to large
  brains – at least in primates. Researchers say the results suggest the brain
  co-evolved with manual dexterity in such mammals. “We imagine an evolutionary
  scenario in which a primate or human has become more intelligent, and with
  that comes the ability to think about action planning, think about what you
  are doing with your hands, and realise that actually you are more efficient at
  doing it one way or another,” said Dr Joanna Baker, lead author of the
  research from the University of Reading. “And those that have longer thumbs or
  more ability to manipulate the objects in the way that the mind can see were
  likely to be more successful.” Large brains and manual dexterity are both
  thought to have played an important role in human evolution, with opposable
  thumbs a key feature that enabled a greater ability to grip and manipulate
  items – including tools. However, with some other primates having partly
  opposable thumbs, questions have remained over whether other changes in the
  hand – such as thumb length – could also be important in the evolution of tool
  use. “In general terms, you can say that the longer the thumb you have, the
  more motion you have to pick up and control small objects,” said Baker. To
  explore the issue Baker and colleagues studied the estimated brain mass and
  thumb length of 94 primate species, from five of our ancient hominin relatives
  to lemurs. The results, published in the journal Communications Biology,
  reveal humans and most other hominins have thumbs that are significantly
  longer than would be predicted based on the hand proportions of primates as a
  while. However, further analysis revealed an intriguing pattern. “When you
  have longer thumbs relative to your overall hand, that tends to come in
  conjunction with overall increased brain size,” said Baker. Indeed, once the
  size of our brains are considered, humans and their close relatives are no
  longer outliers among primates. “We’re not saying we don’t have exceptionally
  long thumbs. We do. And we’re not saying we don’t have exceptionally large
  brains. We do. But given the relationship between the two, that’s happening
  across all primates,” said Baker. “So if you have a longer thumb, you have a
  larger brain, regardless of what species you are.” Only the early hominin A
  sediba broke the trend, with a thumb that was longer than expected, even after
  accounting for brain size – something Baker said is probably related to a life
  lived in the trees and on the ground. Further analysis revealed that it is the
  neocortex, a brain region involved in cognition, sensation and planning of
  actions, that is larger in primates with longer thumbs. “The fact that it
  isn’t one of the other very important parts of the brain associated with motor
  control [such as the cerebellum] was really surprising,” said Baker. However,
  the study does not support the idea that thumb lengths alone can be used to
  identify tool use, with the relationship to brain size constant across all
  primates, regardless of whether they used tools. “Whilst not completely
  surprising, we did expect that there might be some marked shift in hominins
  that we just didn’t see,” said Baker. Dr Fotios Alexandros Karakostis, a group
  leader and senior researcher in biological anthropology at the University of
  Tübingen who was not involved in the work, said the study suggested that hand
  and brain adaptations probably co-evolved. But Karakostis said the study also
  noted that thumb length and brain size alone could not fully explain or
  represent human-like manual dexterity or the evolution of our brains. “A
  fuller understanding will require integrating other key hand anatomical
  traits, biomechanical model simulations, and further experimental research on
  the specific neural mechanisms linked to manual dexterity and human-like tool
  use,” he said.
