  An ancient and “nearly naked” black hole that astronomers believe may have
  been created in the first fraction of a second after the big bang has been
  spotted by the James Webb space telescope. If confirmed as a so-called
  primordial black hole, a theoretical class of object predicted to exist by
  Stephen Hawking but never before seen, the discovery would upend prevailing
  theories of the universe. Until now, the mainstream view has been that stars
  and galaxies appeared first and that black holes were created only when the
  earliest stars ran out of fuel and collapsed under their own gravity. But the
  latest observations by the space telescope, which reveal a gargantuan black
  hole with only a sparse halo of surrounding material dating back to the dawn
  of the cosmos, appear incompatible with this sequence of events. “This black
  hole is nearly naked,” said Prof Roberto Maiolino, a cosmologist at the
  University of Cambridge who is one of the team behind the observations. “This
  is really challenging for the theories. It seems that this black hole has
  formed without being preceded by a galaxy around it.” Primordial black holes
  are hypothesised to have been formed in the first fraction of a second after
  the big bang by denser and hotter regions collapsing in on themselves. In this
  scenario, black holes of varying sizes were stitched into the fabric of the
  cosmos from almost the beginning and acted as gravitational pockets around
  which the dust and gas that formed the first galaxies began to cluster.
  Hawking pioneered the theory in the 1970s, but with no observational proof in
  the decades since they have come to be viewed as speculative or “exotic”. The
  latest observations focus on a “little red dot” known as QSO1 dating back more
  than 13bn years to when the universe was just 700m years old. It is one of a
  scattering of such dots found by the JWST that are so red, so compact and so
  bright that astronomers have concluded they must be ancient supermassive black
  holes. Given that black holes are typically assumed to start small and
  snowball over time by gobbling up stars, scientists have been puzzled about
  how these black holes got so big so early in the universe’s history. Despite
  QSO1’s extreme distance, astronomers were able to track the orbital speed of
  the swirling halo of gas and dust. This measurement gave the mass of the
  central black hole as 50m solar masses, with the total mass of the surrounding
  material being less than half of this value, according to the findings posted
  on the preprint Arxiv website. “This is in stark contrast with what we observe
  in our local universe, where the black holes at the centre of galaxies [like
  the Milky Way] are about a thousand times less massive than their host
  galaxy,” said Maiolino. In a separate analysis, the glowing material around
  the black hole was found to be chemically “pristine”, comprising almost
  exclusively of hydrogen and helium, the two elements left over after the big
  bang. The absence of heavier elements, which are forged in stars, adds to
  evidence that there is no significant star formation in the black hole’s
  vicinity. “These results are a paradigm change,” said Maiolino. “Here we’re
  witnessing a massive black hole formed without much of a galaxy, as far as we
  can say from the data.” Another way this could have occurred is through a vast
  cloud of gas and dust in the early universe collapsing directly into a black
  hole rather than fragmenting and forming stars. But “direct collapse” is
  predicted to require very specific environmental conditions that are not
  evident in the observations, leading the scientists to have a slight
  preference for the primordial black hole scenario. Prof Andrew Pontzen, a
  cosmologist at University of Durham who was not involved in the research,
  said: “A confirmed primordial origin for black holes would have profound
  implications for fundamental laws of physics. “The researchers behind this
  study use new JWST observations to strengthen the case for primordial origins,
  but it’s an indirect argument and it will take time for the debate to be
  settled. A decade from now the next generation of gravitational wave
  detectors, perfect for sniffing out black holes across the entire universe,
  will settle the matter.”
