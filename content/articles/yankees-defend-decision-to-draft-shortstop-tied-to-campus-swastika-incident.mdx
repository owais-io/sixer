  The New York Yankees’ decision to draft University of Utah shortstop Core
  Jackson in the fifth round of last month’s MLB draft has drawn scrutiny after
  the Athletic reported that Jackson once drew a swastika on a Jewish student’s
  dorm room door. The incident took place in 2021, when Jackson was a
  17-year-old freshman at the University of Nebraska. He told the Athletic he
  had been “blackout drunk” and had no memory of it. “I felt like the worst
  person in the world,” he said. Nebraska fined him, assigned community service
  and required online sensitivity training, but did not suspend him from the
  team. Jackson said he wanted to apologize directly but was told by campus
  police not to contact the victim. Yankees amateur scouting director Damon
  Oppenheimer said the team carried out the most extensive background check of
  his 23-year tenure before selecting Jackson. The decision was approved by
  owner Hal Steinbrenner and supported by Jewish officials inside the club,
  including team president Randy Levine. “We were looking for accountability,”
  Oppenheimer said. “We believe his actions since the incident show remorse and
  growth.” Jackson signed for $147,500, well below the slot value of $411,100
  for the 164th overall pick. He has already reported to High-A Hudson Valley.
  His agent, Blake Corosky, initially considered dropping him but reconsidered
  under two conditions: that Jackson disclose the incident to every MLB team
  before the 2024 draft and that he work with Diamondbacks prospect Jacob
  Steinmetz, the first practicing Orthodox Jewish player ever drafted. Jackson,
  who grew up in a Christian household in Wyoming, admitted he knew little about
  Judaism or the historical weight of the swastika. “That doesn’t excuse it,” he
  said. “But it shows how much I had to learn.” The swastika incident is not
  Jackson’s only off-field trouble. In September 2024, while playing at Utah, he
  was charged with DUI. The case was reduced to misdemeanor impaired driving
  after he completed community service, substance-abuse training and paid fines.
  Jackson says he has not had a drink since. His winding college career took him
  from Nebraska to South Mountain Community College in Arizona and finally to
  Utah, where he hit .363 with four home runs and 41 RBIs in 2024. Scouts
  praised his arm strength, power and athleticism. For the Yankees, those tools
  – along with Jackson’s willingness to confront his past – were enough to
  outweigh concerns. But in New York, home to the world’s largest Jewish
  community outside Israel, the decision remains polarizing. “I think it’s
  important that this is part of my story,” Jackson said. “God has given me this
  platform, and I want to use it to show forgiveness and growth.”
