  For 50 long years, life in Hamilton, a town of 63,000 people a half-hour north
  of Cincinnati, was in decline. Factories closed and thousands of residents
  moved away to Cincinnati, Columbus and beyond. The scourge of the opioid
  epidemic during the early 2000s sucked the life out of Butler county’s seat of
  government. But then, slowly, immigrants came to town. And things began to get
  better. Inside Mary’s Comida Casera, an unadorned Mexican restaurant serving
  Guanajuato food on Hamilton’s southside, a telenovela plays on a pair of
  televisions while two elementary-age kids watch cartoons on a tablet in the
  corner. The restaurant, formerly a 136-year-old residential property, along
  with dozens of Latin American cafes, stores and businesses in the Jefferson
  and Riverview neighborhoods have helped bring life back to Hamilton’s
  southside. This month, the community’s growing presence was acknowledged when
  a huge mural titled Viva el Sueño – live the dream – was inaugurated in the
  Jefferson neighborhood. “As a brown woman who’s called this city home for over
  two decades, seeing public art that reflects our stories, struggles and dreams
  was incredibly moving,” says Mitzi Hernandez, a community leader who moved
  from Mexico City to Hamilton 23 years ago. “It felt like we were finally being
  seen.” Nearly four in 10 residents in a host of census tracts immediately west
  and south of downtown Hamilton identify as Hispanic. Despite its relatively
  small size, the number of people in the city who speak a language other than
  English at home is almost double the Ohio average. Not only are immigrants
  contributing to the renewed vibrancy of life in Hamilton through festivals and
  community outreach work, their income, property and business tax dollars are
  padding the coffers of local and state authorities. Fear in the heart of a new
  American community But in the center of the neighborhood, a stone’s throw
  across a grassy area from Mary’s Comida Casera, lies a place that’s
  increasingly striking fear into the hearts of Hamilton’s immigrants: the
  Butler county jail. A report by the Journal-News newspaper that analyzed the
  jail roster on 8 July found that of the 384 people detained at that time, more
  than 90% were there on immigration-related charges. “There’s a real and
  growing concern,” says Hernandez. “This fear isn’t limited to just the
  Hispanic community – it impacts all immigrant groups.” The jail is run by
  Richard Jones, an outspoken sheriff who among his long list of
  anti-immigration policies recently joked that while Florida has “Alligator
  Alcatraz”, his town has a “swamp squad” – posting images of inflatable
  crocodiles at the jail to his Facebook page this month. Many locals and rights
  groups called the posts “cruel”. Jones and his populist, anti-immigrant
  messaging enjoy significant support among the local population. Since 2004, he
  has won every election for sheriff, often prevailing by three-to-one margins
  or running unopposed. He has appeared on Fox News calling for the death
  penalty for drug dealers. But his controversial views go beyond mere rhetoric.
  The detaining of hundreds of people on immigration charges earns the jail more
  than $24,000 a day or $720,000 a month in fees paid by US Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement (Ice) – on top of $36 an hour in transportation fees the
  jail charges Ice. At this month’s Butler County Fair, the sheriff’s office
  display included two mangled cars that were involved in a fatal crash last
  year caused by an undocumented migrant from Mexico whose blood alcohol level
  was more than twice the legal driving limit. Why it picked this and not any
  one of the other 31 fatal crashes that happened in the county last year isn’t
  apparent – emails, calls, voicemails and an in-person visit to the jail by the
  Guardian failed to secure an interview with Jones. On the other side of the
  jail walls is Ayman Soliman, an Egyptian-born, Cincinnati-based imam who was
  detained this month following the termination of his longstanding asylum
  status. His confinement on 9 July, allegedly related to membership of a group
  purportedly linked to the Muslim Brotherhood – an organization outlawed in
  Egypt but not by the United States – has sparked recriminations, mounting fear
  and anger, and violent responses to protests in south-west Ohio. Soliman’s
  detention and the outpouring of anger that has followed are emblematic of the
  wider split in American society, between those who believe the repressive
  policies of the Trump administration are key to keeping the country safe, and
  those who think migrants are a cornerstone of the American way of life. During
  a court hearing on 22 July, Soliman appeared by video link in a
  yellow-and-white prison jumpsuit wearing brown glasses and a salt-and-pepper
  beard. When asked by the immigration judge whether he needed an interpreter he
  declined. Soliman’s calm demeanor during the hearing belies what’s at stake
  for him. Should he be deported to Egypt, he could face the death penalty; this
  month, an Egyptian news outlet accused him of being a leading member of the
  Muslim Brotherhood, which he has vehemently denied. Cincinnati seethes His
  predicament has fueled a groundswell of anger linked to police beatings,
  felony charges and seemingly impromptu firings. On 17 July, Madeline Fening
  and photography intern Lucas Griffith, two CityBeat journalists, were among 15
  people arrested on felony rioting charges following an until-then peaceful
  protest in downtown Cincinnati against Soliman’s detention. Footage of the
  arrests shows the demonstrators walking across the John A Roebling Bridge
  before Kentucky police, whose jurisdiction extends across the city’s Ohio
  River bridges, repeatedly punch, shoot pepper balls and violently subdue
  several participants. While the felony charges initially filed against the
  reporters have since been dropped (police claimed the journalists “knowingly
  participated in a riot”), they still face several misdemeanor charges. In an
  environment in which the Trump administration has repeatedly vowed to go after
  elements of the media it deems are hostile to its positions, press freedom
  groups have assailed the charges. “Our clients were doing their jobs and
  should have never been arrested in the first place,” said William Sharp,
  senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Kentucky, which is defending the
  journalists. “A free press is critical to a functioning democracy, and those
  members of the press who, like our clients, merely cover a story enjoy the
  full protection of the US and Kentucky constitutions to do so. We look forward
  to zealously defending them in court.” The journalists and others face a
  preliminary hearing on 14 August. “Journalists and journalism are under threat
  … It is disappointing that our efforts to cover a protest were deliberately
  misinterpreted as rioting,” says Ashley Moor, editor of CityBeat, in a
  statement provided through the ACLU of Kentucky. “The suggestion that we were
  rioting was baseless and designed to intimidate us into silence and
  complicity.” All the while, the Kenton county police department has placed
  Zachary Stayton, the officer who repeatedly punched protest participant
  Brandon Hill, on administrative leave with pay, pending an investigation.
  Stayton had been previously the subject of a 2023 lawsuit for excessive use of
  force. At a preliminary hearing for Hill, who was hospitalized due to the
  severity of his injuries and who is one of four protestors still facing felony
  rioting charges, the judge declined to view the video of the punching,
  stating, “The officer’s testimony is sufficient.” ‘This is my dream job’ Nor
  have Soliman’s former colleagues escaped apparent punishment for speaking out
  about his predicament. For the past decade, the Rev Lizzy Diop worked as a
  chaplain at the Cincinnati Children’s hospital, four of those years spent
  alongside Soliman. “Cincinnati Children’s has patients from around the world
  and quite a few from the Middle East. It’s a big thing to travel to a new
  country with a new culture to get medical care – it’s the most stressful time
  of their lives,” says Diop, who is one of three people Soliman has asked to be
  allowed to visit him in jail. “The delight in somebody’s eyes, and the joy
  they take in [caring for] the kids; he had that.” When Diop heard that Soliman
  had been detained, she was shocked. “He’s not somebody who talks a lot about
  himself, but early on, he said: ‘I came from Egypt to the United States to
  save my life.’” Five days after his detention, she visited Soliman at the
  jail. Days later, after being interviewed by a local television station – a
  move she believed was explicitly cleared by her employers – Diop was fired
  from the hospital. “I briefly talked to my manager and director, and we
  decided I would take PTO and meet off-campus and not wear any [hospital] gear
  [for the television interview],” she says. “I was talking about a former
  employee and some particular interaction about visiting a friend who was
  incarcerated.” When Diop arrived at work the morning after the interview
  aired, her director told her she was facing serious disciplinary action for
  violating media policy. “This is my dream job. It’s a huge part of my
  identity. I felt like my world, my life, my self had been torn apart,” she
  says. “I’ve been here for 10 years, and I’ve never had a disciplinary action;
  I got an ‘exceeds expectations’ review weeks before I was fired. I’ve done
  nothing but good work,” she says. Diop is still at a loss as to why she was
  fired. “Have I messed with a donor? Have I caused [the hospital] to fear
  repercussions from the Trump administration? I don’t have an answer, but those
  are the two things that I thought of that could have happened.” Diop isn’t
  alone. Days after Adam Allen, another chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s
  hospital, attended the vigil that preceded the bridge protest, the hospital
  fired him. “They’re firing people for speaking out,” Allen told the Cincinnati
  Enquirer. Cincinnati Children’s hospital is regarded as one of the top
  hospitals in the US and receives hundreds of millions of federal government
  dollars every year for treatment and research. In March, the hospital was one
  of three healthcare facilities investigated by the federal government on
  discrimination charges for programs aimed at helping students from minority
  backgrounds. “We don’t comment on current or former personnel,” responded a
  Cincinnati Children’s hospital spokesperson to the Guardian’s query asking why
  Diop and Allen were fired. Back in Hamilton, leaders in the Hispanic
  communities are further panicked by the move last month to allow local law
  enforcement officers in Butler county to do the job of Ice agents such as
  detaining and arresting people suspected to be undocumented immigrants. At
  least 10 Butler county deputies have become certified Ice agents having taken
  part in a 40-hour training program. With nearly three-quarters of Hamilton’s
  foreign-born population not US citizens, an overwhelming majority of the
  community is living in fear. “There’s anxiety, especially as we see Ice
  activity increasing in other states,” says Hernandez. “But our community is
  incredibly resilient. We’ve faced hardship before. Moving to a new country in
  search of a better life takes courage, and despite fear, people continue to
  push forward. The most important thing we can do is come together.” There are
  signs that Republicans in Butler county, where almost 63% of voters backed
  Trump in November’s presidential election, are growing uneasy with Jones’s and
  the White House’s anti-immigrant drive. On Friday, the Butler county
  prosecutor, Mike Gmoser, a self-declared “lifelong conservative Republican”,
  warned of “potential liability” and legal implications for county leaders and
  authorities for imprisoning hundreds of people on immigration rather than
  criminal charges, and said he had sought the opinion of the state attorney
  general. Soliman last week filed a lawsuit challenging the termination of his
  asylum status, and his next court hearing is set for 12 August, taking his
  detention at Butler county jail to more than a month.
