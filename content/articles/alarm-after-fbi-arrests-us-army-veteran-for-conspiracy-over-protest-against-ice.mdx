  The arrest of a US army veteran who protested against the Trump
  administration’s immigration crackdown has raised alarms among legal experts
  and fellow veterans familiar with his service in Afghanistan. Bajun Mavalwalla
  II – a former army sergeant who survived a roadside bomb blast on a special
  operations mission in Afghanistan – was charged in July with “conspiracy to
  impede or injure officers” after joining a demonstration against federal
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in Spokane, Washington. Legal
  experts say the case marks an escalation in the administration’s attacks on
  first amendment rights. Afghanistan war veterans who know him say the case
  against Mavalwalla appears unjust. “Here’s a guy who held a top secret
  clearance and was privy to some of the most sensitive information we have, who
  served in a combat zone,” said Kenneth Koop, a retired colonel who trained the
  Afghan military and police during Mavalwalla’s deployment. “To see him treated
  like this really sticks in my craw.” The 11 June protest against Ice that led
  to Mavalwalla’s arrest was confrontational, leaving a government van’s
  windshield smashed and tires slashed, but Mavalwalla was not among the more
  than two dozen people arrested at the scene. More than a month passed before
  the FBI arrived at his door on 15 July. The 35-year-old, who used his GI Bill
  to earn a degree in sustainable communities from Sonoma State University, was
  set to move into a 3,000-sq-ft house that day, which he had bought with his
  girlfriend, a nurse and fellow Afghanistan war veteran, with the help of a
  loan backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mavalwalla’s father, a
  retired US army intelligence officer with three Bronze Stars earned during
  tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, brought his truck for the occasion. He planned
  to move his son into a dream home in a bucolic, southern section of Spokane
  that was large enough to accommodate their blended family (Mavalwalla has one
  child; his girlfriend, Katelyn Gaston, has three) and solidify the couple’s
  life together. But at 6am the FBI knocked on Mavalwalla’s door and they
  arrested him. Cell phone video shot by Mavalwalla’s father shows the veteran –
  tall, fit, with wire-rimmed glasses, tight ponytail and trim goatee – smiling
  in apparent disbelief, his hands shackled behind his back. “This is not how I
  planned to spend my moving day,” Mavalwalla says, as agents search his pockets
  and force him into a black pickup truck. “I’m a military veteran. I’m an
  American citizen.” At 3pm, Mavalwalla, who receives disability compensation
  for post traumatic stress disorder connected to his service in Afghanistan,
  appeared in federal court along with eight other people indicted in connection
  with a protest against an Ice transport that occurred a month earlier. While
  the indictment alleges other protesters struck federal officers and let the
  air out of the tires of an Ice transport, Mavalwalla was not charged with
  obstruction or assault. Instead, he was charged with “conspiracy to impede or
  injure officers”. According to the indictment, Mavalwalla and his
  co-defendants “physically blocked the drive-way of the federal facility and/or
  physically pushed against officers despite orders to disperse and efforts to
  remove them from the property”. Mavalwalla, who has no criminal record,
  pleaded not guilty. His family says Mavalwalla’s actions were motivated by a
  commitment to non-violent protest, which traces back to the family’s deep
  connection to the Indian independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi. A one-minute
  video posted on Instagram shows the army veteran briefly jostle with an
  officer whose face is covered by a ski mask and sunglasses. Mavalwalla then
  locks arms with other demonstrators to block the gate. The conspiracy count
  carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three
  years of supervised release. He was released on his own recognizance while
  awaiting trial, with a judge even giving him permission to travel to
  Disneyland for a previously planned family vacation. ‘He’s a test case to see
  how far they can go’ The US attorney’s office in Spokane, which brought the
  charges, declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation. The indictment
  was handed down two days after career prosecutor Richard Barker, the acting US
  attorney for eastern Washington state, resigned. In a social post, Barker
  called his exit “a very difficult decision”. “I am grateful that I never had
  to sign an indictment or file a brief that I didn’t believe in,” he wrote. The
  current acting US attorney, nominated for the permanent post by Donald Trump,
  is Pete Serrano, a former litigator for the Silent Majority Foundation, a
  conservative advocacy group. In February, Serrano filed an amicus brief in
  support of Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, a position
  at odds with the 14th amendment. He has no prosecutorial experience and has
  described the January 6 US Capitol rioters as “political prisoners”. Patty
  Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington state, has pledged to block his
  confirmation. Legal experts say the conspiracy charges against Mavalwalla
  underscore the lengths the Trump administration will go to quash protests
  against Ice, giving the immigration agency a free hand as it steps up raids,
  adds agents and seeks to achieve the president’s goal of 3,000 deportations
  per day. So far, the Trump administration has primarily charged demonstrators
  for assault and obstruction, acts that typically involve a victim and an
  assailant. But a federal conspiracy charge is a crime of intent. In this case,
  prosecutors would just have to prove that defendants agreed in concert to
  impede or injure an officer. “He’s a test case to see how far they can go,”
  said Luis Miranda, a former chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland
  Security under Joe Biden. ‘Honest, direct, polite and very trustworthy’ The
  charges against Mavalwalla sent shockwaves through a tight community of
  veterans with connections forged in Afghanistan that intensified after the
  bungled August 2021 US withdrawal. The fall of Kabul to the Taliban brought
  them together again to evacuate Afghans who worked alongside the US military.
  After his arrest, Mavalwalla’s commanding officer, Col Charles Hancock, who is
  retired, wrote on Facebook that he knew the trained crypto-linguist to be
  “honest, direct, polite and very trustworthy” and was “deeply concerned about
  the current state of affairs in our country”. Koop, the retired colonel, said
  Mavalwalla put the diplomatic connections he gained due to his security
  clearance at the disposal of Koop’s translator, who escaped and otherwise
  might have been murdered by the Taliban. “It was no surprise to me that
  concern for the individual, human rights and safety would be right up Bajun’s
  portfolio and mindset,” Koop said. As word spread that Mavalwalla knew how to
  rescue people in the frenetic days after the fall of Kabul, more people
  reached out. When Erin Piper, the community director at a church in Livonia,
  Michigan, learned that a relative of one of her son’s friends had worked as a
  custodian on a US military base in Afghanistan, she called Mavalwalla to see
  if he could help bring over an extended family of aunts, uncles and siblings
  who had been left behind. Mavalwalla sprung into action, locating safe houses
  for 20 members of the former custodian’s extended family and at least a dozen
  other Afghan civilians whose family members collaborated with the US military,
  she said. He helped them acquire travel documents, arranged for safe transport
  over land to Pakistan and raised $130,000 to pay expenses, including visa
  applications and flights there to Brazil and eventually to the United States.
  “It was hard,” Piper said, but Mavalwalla was patient. In text messages, he
  urged Piper to be sure to take care of herself and her family. “It does no
  good for us to neglect those right in front of us,” he wrote on 25 September
  2021, a month after the Taliban takeover. “You cannot save the world,” he
  added. “It’s good to try though.” ‘An issue of selective prosecution’
  Mavalwalla was one of hundreds of people to respond to a 11 June social media
  post from the former president of the Spokane city council that encouraged
  protesters to block an Ice transport they believed would carry two Venezuelan
  immigrants who were in the country legally, petitioning for asylum when they
  were detained. “I am going to sit in front of the bus,” Ben Stuckart, the
  former city council president, wrote. “Feel free to join me.” In interviews,
  former prosecutors said the conspiracy statute was broad and afforded the
  Trump administration potentially sweeping powers. “Federal conspiracy charges
  are a wondrous thing,” said Bruce Antkowiak, a former federal prosecutor who
  teaches at Saint Vincent College in Pennsylvania. “It is a vast net which you
  can use to catch a bunch of people.” Under this law, prosecutors won’t have to
  prove that Mavalwalla blocked the bus or attacked agents, Antkowiak said. “The
  major issue in a conspiracy case is intent,” he said. “You have to prove an
  agreement. You don’t have to prove that people sat down together and made a
  pledge. You don’t even have to write up an agreement they have verbally, but
  you have to prove that these people agreed to act in concert,” he said.
  Because of the law’s sweeping power, prosecutors typically use discretion,
  experts said. “It seems like what we have here is an issue of selective
  prosecution,” Robert Chang, a law professor at the University of California,
  Irvine, said that will lead to a “chilling effect on free speech under the
  first amendment”. Antkowiak said he expected the justice department to bring
  conspiracy charges more frequently in the months ahead, given the Trump
  administration’s desire for Ice agents to pursue an agenda of rapid
  deportations unhindered. Jennifer Chacón, a Stanford University law professor
  who studies the intersection of immigration and criminal law, said she would
  not be surprised if Ice increased monitoring social media to bring more cases
  like the one against Mavalwalla. “You could view this as an attempt to send a
  message to everyone who feels a sense of justice and moral outrage over Ice
  raids – you could face prosecution, too,” she said. Mavalwalla’s mother, US
  army veteran Ellyn Mavalwalla, said her son did not know Stuckart, the former
  city councilman whose social media post sparked the demonstration, and only
  met him in jail on 15 July, after both were arrested on federal charges by the
  FBI. His father, retired intelligence officer Bajun Ray Mavalwalla, said he
  believed his son had been racially profiled – that in reviewing footage from
  the demonstration, federal authorities had fixated on the demonstrator “with a
  funny name”. He said he worried the United States was being “taken over by
  fascists”, but also that the promise of America that drew his family here
  generations ago would endure. “My father left India on the deck of a boat, at
  19 years old,” the elder Mavalwalla said. “He floated for six days across the
  Arabian Sea to Kuwait. He nearly died when he arrived. Then an American family
  sponsored him to come to the US.” Gandhi’s legacy In addition to military
  service, a commitment to peaceful protest has been at the heart of the
  Mavalwalla family for generations. Mavalwalla II’s great-great, grand-uncle,
  Parsee Rustomjee worked with Gandhi in South Africa and supported the Indian
  independence leader when he launched his legendary, non-violent revolution
  against British imperialism. The two families were close – according to the
  family, Gandhi was godfather to Mavalwalla’s great-grandmother – “and Bajun
  grew up with stories,” his mother said, with social justice at the center.
  After Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, his burial shroud was distributed among
  his family’s closest confidants, including members of Mavalwalla’s family, and
  is now held by Mavalwalla’s mother. Three days after the protest, his mother
  texted him: “Channel your inner Gandhi.” “I know, mom,” Mavalwalla replied.
  “Always non-violence.”
