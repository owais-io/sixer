  Travel operator Jet2 shares have dived after it cut back its seats on sale for
  the winter, warning of a difficult market with customers booking holidays ever
  nearer the departure date. Shares in the holiday group fell by 15% after it
  told investors its earnings for the year were now likely to be at the lower
  end of forecasts. Jet2 said it would have to cut 200,000 seats, from 5.8m to
  5.6m, over the winter season because of “a less certain consumer environment”
  – despite the viral spread of its marketing jingle this summer. The ad
  campaign – a Jess Glynne song ending with the message, “Nothing beats a Jet2
  holiday” – has been widely repurposed on TikTok and social media to ironically
  soundtrack disastrous vacation scenes. Jet2 said it would now be “reallocating
  marketing monies”. The firm said customers were booking later than ever, a
  trend that made for “limited visibility” and meant that pricing was only
  rising modestly, with much of winter seat capacity still to sell. Package
  holiday passenger numbers grew by 2% in summer 2025, slower than the 8% growth
  reported the previous year. Its flight-only passenger numbers were up 17%.
  Steve Heapy, Jet2’s chief executive, said: “Although we are currently
  operating in a difficult market, we have a proven business model, a loyal
  customer base, a flexible approach to capacity management and of course our
  multi-award-winning customer service. “We believe that these factors provide
  the foundation for a solid financial result this year and for further
  profitable growth in the years to come.” A hot early summer and economic
  uncertainty may have contributed to the late booking trend, which Jet2
  highlighted in July, when shares fell despite the firm unveiling record
  profits. Shares in easyJet, which also now has a growing holiday arm, fell
  almost 4% as trading opened on Thursday, while IAG shares also took an early
  dip before recovering to 1% down by late morning.
