  Freakier Friday review – puppyishly uninhibited Jamie Lee Curtis saves
  body-swap sequel
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  No one could be gamer or goofier than Jamie Lee Curtis in this latest twist in
  the Freaky Friday body-swap franchise; she finds some distinctly likable form,
  plays broad comedy to the hilt and pretty much carries the movie – with the
  help of some nice supporting cameo turns – when her co-star Lindsay Lohan
  isn’t exactly nailing the laughs. And it should be said that as an essay in
  alternative existences and parallel realities, this film and Curtis’s starring
  role are far more interesting than the bafflingly overrated Oscar-winner
  Everything Everywhere All at Once. The preceding film, from 2003, had Curtis
  and Lohan as a quarrelling mother and daughter who swap bodies due to the
  hilarious magical otherness of Chinese fortune cookies. (In 2025, the new
  version is a bit culturally wary of gags like that.) It is based on Mary
  Rodgers’s 1972 novel, first filmed in 1976 with Jodie Foster as the daughter,
  a formidably precocious young star who was in those days considered to be
  already body-swapped into fierce adulthood. The publicity for this film
  promises legacy cameos and when one teen character talks about her French
  boyfriend, many FF fans will have been excitably wondering if this French
  boyfriend has a French-speaking mom played by a certain French-speaking star?
  In this new contemporary reality, written by Jordan Weiss and directed by
  Nisha Ganatra, Curtis’s character Tess Coleman is a grandma, therapist and
  parenting podcaster, and her once-tearaway daughter, Lohan’s character Anna,
  is a music producer and single mom to a gen Z teen; this is Harper, played by
  Julia Butters, a young actor still legendary for her scene opposite Leonardo
  DiCaprio in Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. When Harper has a big
  fight in school with her obnoxious, princess-y British lab partner, Lily
  (played by non-Briton Sophia Hammons), she is horrified when Anna falls hard
  for Lily’s hot single dad Eric (Manny Jacinto); these enemies are both
  appalled at the prospect of becoming stepsisters. This situation becomes even
  more complicated – freakier in fact – when a zany palm reader and fortune
  teller triggers a new cosmic body-swap nightmare, this time involving four
  women, not two. Another version of this movie might have wanted to dip its toe
  into the issues of body image and identity: Freakier Friday keeps it light,
  partly as a result of Curtis’s jokey grandma, in whose knockabout generational
  presence there is no question of anything tricky. Curtis gets the laughs with
  her puppyishly uninhibited performance and there are some great gags,
  including one at the expense of oldsters who use a certain social media
  platform. There are also some amusing contributions from SNL trouper Vanessa
  Bayer as the fortune teller, comedian X Mayo as the school’s dyspeptic
  principal and Santina Muha as a US official who has to assess the authenticity
  of Anna and Eric’s marriage. As for Lohan, she does a reasonable job, although
  her own body-swapped status as the legendary wild-child of old who is now
  playing a stressed middle-aged person has to remain unemphasised, simply
  because Lohan doesn’t really have the comedy chops. It’s Curtis who embodies
  the story’s wacky spirit. • Freakier Friday is out on 7 August in Australia
  and 8 August in the UK and US.
