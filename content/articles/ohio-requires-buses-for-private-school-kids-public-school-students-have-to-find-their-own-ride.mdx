  For about 2,000 students attending high school in Dayton, Ohio, there won’t be
  a bus in sight when they walk out the door for the beginning of the school
  year this week. Ruben Castillo, an 11th grade student at Meadowdale Career
  Technology Center, is one of them. Ohio law means that public school districts
  such as Dayton’s are responsible for transporting students who attend private
  and charter schools. When they fail to do so, they risk fines of millions of
  dollars. A shortage of drivers and buses combined with the threat of fines,
  means that public school districts in Dayton and around Ohio find themselves
  relegating their own students to the back of the transportation line. “I’m
  going to have to use Uber, and it’s going to cost me $25-$30 a day to get to
  and from school,” says Castillo. “In wintertime, when demand is higher, it’s
  probably going to be more.” At 180 school days over the course of a year,
  that’s thousands of dollars he is set to fork out from his own pocket. For the
  past several years, school administrators in Dayton, Cincinnati and elsewhere
  have been trying to get around the problem by issuing students with bus passes
  for public transportation. But children riding public buses have reported
  being subjected to a variety of dangers. Public transportation administrators
  have also reported difficulties trying to serve the public and thousands of
  students all at once. The situation came to a tragic head on the morning of 4
  April when 18-year-old Alfred Hale III was shot dead at the public bus hub in
  downtown Dayton while en route to class at Dunbar high school. Shortly after
  Hale’s killing, Ohio lawmakers introduced a law making it illegal for Dayton
  public schools (DPS) to buy public bus vouchers for students. The burden of
  getting children to school now falls on students’ parents, grandparents, local
  churches and charities, say officials. Families who choose to continue to have
  their students use public buses to get to and from school will have to fork
  out at least $540 per high school student a year. “There seems to be an
  aggressive approach to the most vulnerable families and people in America,”
  says DPS’s superintendent, David Lawrence. “Not only is it unfair, it’s
  onerous that public schools have to provide transportation to non-public
  school students.” What’s happening in Ohio is a result of a wider effort by
  conservative politicians to push for more children to attend charter and
  private schools, many of which are run by religious organizations. Republican
  politicians hold a supermajority across Ohio’s legislature and have built up a
  $1bn fund in the form of vouchers for families who want to send their students
  to private and charter schools. Ohio is not alone. Republican-dominated state
  legislatures have been pushing for or have already enacted laws that see
  billions of dollars of taxpayer money directed to funding private school
  voucher systems in Texas, Florida, Iowa, Tennessee and elsewhere. In
  Pennsylvania and Minnesota, where political control is largely split between
  Democrats and Republicans, public schools are required to provide
  transportation for students attending non-public schools. In January, Donald
  Trump signed an executive order steering taxpayer funds from public schools to
  private schools. Many in Democratic-leaning cities say they are being
  targeted. In Cincinnati, children as young as 13 are being forced to use
  public transportation to get to and from school due to funding shortages that
  this year will see more than 100 yellow bus routes cut. In Columbus, where
  more than half of all students are African American, the public school system
  is required to bus students of 162 private and charter schools. About 1.8
  million, or 80%, of all school-going students in Ohio attend public schools
  and nearly two-thirds of students attending Dayton public schools are African
  American. In July, the state passed a budget that saw the smallest increase in
  spending on K-12 public education in more than a decade. “It’s simple – if we
  did not have to bus non-public school students on our transportation, we could
  transport every single one of our K-12 students on yellow buses,” says Jocelyn
  Rhynard, a member of the Dayton public school board. DPS transports between
  4,000 and 5,000 charter and private school students every school day. “It’s a
  direct result of the legislation from the extremist Republicans at the Ohio
  statehouse mandating that we must transport non-public students as well as
  public students in our district.” But Republican politicians disagree. “We had
  an 18-year-old get shot and killed. The environment for the students is not
  good down there. The NAACP interviewed the children, they don’t want to ride
  the public transportation buses, they want to ride the yellow school buses,”
  says Phil Plummer, a Republican party state representative who spearheaded the
  budget amendment banning DPS from giving its students public bus vouchers.
  Plummer says he and others “found 25 school buses” that DPS could purchase.
  “They decided not to transport their kids,” he says. DPS administrators, who
  pay drivers the highest rates in the region, say about 70 buses would be
  required to meet the need, a number that could take up to two years to
  procure. Lawrence says the process of buying buses and training drivers is not
  simple. “It’s an 18-month cycle. [Buses] are $150,000 to $190,000 each to buy,
  and ones with backup cameras and air conditioning are [even] more expensive.
  Then drivers have to take at least 10 tests before they become fully
  qualified,” he says. With the law coming into effect just months before the
  new school year, parents, students and public school managers have been left
  in a difficult situation. “I’m a single dad raising two kids on my own. We all
  have to be at school at the same time. That’s a big dilemma,” says William
  Johnson, an educator at DPS whose daughter is no longer able to get to school
  using a bus provided by or paid for the district. “I’m lucky that my
  80-year-old father is going to help out taking them to school. But I ask the
  state [politicians] – please come up with a solution. We’re going to lose a
  whole generation of kids if this continues.”
