  Beneath the Georgian city of Bath, a gleaming treasury of Renaissance
  masterpieces created for kings, queens, church leaders and scientists is about
  to be unveiled. Based on the idea of the Renaissance kunstkammer – an art
  chamber – the basement room at the Holburne Museum is crammed with scores of
  exquisite pieces of silverware, paintings, bronzes and ceramics. They include
  an astonishing model of a silver ship, a rare mechanical celestial globe and a
  bronze vessel likely to have belonged to Henry VIII. “It’s wonderful having
  pieces here that you’d usually see in places like the Met in New York or the
  British Museum,” said Chris Stephens, director of the Holburne. The treasures
  were collected over many decades by the Schroder family, who made their
  fortune as merchants and bankers, and have been loaned to the Holburne for at
  least 20 years. A £2m gallery has been created out of two store rooms to show
  off the objects, which have never been brought together in one place before.
  The relationship between the Holburne and the Schroders began about five years
  ago, when the family’s art curator wondered if the museum would like to borrow
  a few of the family’s Renaissance paintings. Stephens boldly asked if they
  could possibly loan all of them. “I thought they’d say no but they were
  delighted and we turned my office into a gallery for them.” The family then
  offered the Holburne other Renaissance treasures and the idea of creating
  Bath’s very own kunstkammer emerged. Stephens said: “The key decision was to
  have everything in there together, not to separate the different art forms.
  That created the sense of the kunstkammer, the Renaissance idea in which
  wealthy people would bring together exotic items from around the world.” Among
  the highlights of the collection is a celestial globe commissioned in the 16th
  century by one of the earliest modern astronomers, Wilhelm IV of Hesse-Kassel.
  When it was wound up, the globe turned to show the position of constellations.
  “It’s like those apps of the night sky you get that tell you which stars you
  are looking at,” Stephens said. “It was made in the 1570s. To have that level
  of precision and complexity and so many moving points is awesome.” The silver
  ship – the Schwarzenberg Nef – was created in about 1580. It is a ceremonial
  ewer – a pitcher or jug – that could be filled with drink through a hole in
  the deck with the spout concealed within the bow. “It’s miraculous,” said
  Stephens, pointing out details such as the rigging billowing out with the
  weight of a crew member and the hefty chicken on a plate in the captain’s
  cabin. It is not certain that Henry VIII handled the bronze cup that appears
  in another cabinet, but the signs are that it was his – one of his inventories
  describes such a vessel weighing exactly the same as this one. Most of the
  objects were collected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They have
  been held at various homes and offices owned by members of the Schroder
  family. The only collection comparable to Bath’s new kunstkammer, Stephens
  said, was the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum, a collection of
  Renaissance treasures collected by Baron Ferdinand Rothschild. “What’s really
  exciting is to see all these objects brought together in one place. It’s
  extraordinary, really.” • The Schroder Gallery opens to the public on 10
