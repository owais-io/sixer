  The last days of August in the UK could be hit by heavy wind, rain and “very
  large waves” if the tail end of Hurricane Erin lashes the country, the Met
  Office has warned. Forecasters are tracking the potential impact of Erin,
  which is now a category 2 storm moving eastwards across the North Atlantic,
  but say any effect on the UK would not happen until at least the middle of
  next week. Tom Morgan, a Met Office meteorologist, said it was “too early for
  specific details about which parts of the country will see the windiest and
  wettest weather” but that the weather across Britain would experience a
  noticeable drop in the next week. “What we can say is that it will gradually
  turn less hot and be more generally changeable,” said Morgan. There could be
  thundery showers during parts of next week, with Thursday and Friday in
  particular more likely to be stormy. The rain, which could spread across the
  UK, would also bring an end to the country’s dry spell. Morgan added: “Britain
  is likely to see some very large waves. Ex-hurricane Erin will bring quite a
  large swell in the sea so we could potentially see waves of 4 to 5 metres in
  height for the Western Isles of Scotland and Ireland and so for holidaymakers
  going to the coast, that could prove quite a hazard.” However, Morgan said the
  potentially unsettled weather was still “a long way in the future” with spells
  of sunshine expected this weekend, which is a bank holiday for England, Wales
  and Northern Ireland. Storm Erin has lost some strength in the past week as it
  moved along the east coast of North America, having previously been classified
  as a category 5, but has still caused more than 2,000 people to be evacuated
  in North Carolina and at least 60 swimmers to be rescued from rip currents at
  Wrightsville Beach on the state’s southern coast on Monday.
