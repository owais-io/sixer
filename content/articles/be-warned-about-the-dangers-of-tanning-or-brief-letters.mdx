  I can’t tell you how sad this article makes me (Burn notice: Gen Z and the
  terrifying rise of extreme tanning, 6 August). Sunbeds and extreme tanning
  cause skin cancer. My son, aged 23, discovered a mole on his back. It took
  quite a bit of persuasion for him to go to his GP. Seemed quite simple: cut it
  out, end of. The mole became more moles, more operations. It then became his
  arms, then his lungs, and then two brain tumours. Two years from his
  diagnosis, he died. I would plead with people to avoid sunbeds, tanning
  without sun cream and complacency. I will never get over the death of my son.
  Ruth Heggarty Sheffield • It is indeed regrettable that art nouveau has long
  been neglected generally in France (Editorial, 8 August), but the city of
  Nancy is an outstanding exception. Furniture, glass and other works by Émile
  Gallé, Louis Majorelle and others are richly represented in the Musée de
  l’École de Nancy. The Musée des Beaux Arts de Nancy has extensive collections,
  and the Villa Majorelle, the designer’s former home, is devoted to his work.
  An essential destination for the enthusiast. Ron Wells Eastbourne, East Sussex
  • Gaby Hinsliff’s interesting article on an artificial intelligence future can
  be usefully extended to historical studies. Finally, we will be able to read
  Genghis’s and Attila’s sides of the story (When a journalist uses AI to
  interview a dead child, isn’t it time to ask what the boundaries should be?, 8
  August). Peter Taylor Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear • Dr Nick Williams’ letter (6
  August), saying he uses planes rather than trains because the latter are
  unreliable, appeared on the same day you reported that flights were suspended
  from Birmingham airport, affecting thousands. John Shirley London • I went to
  the Millet exhibition on Thursday, and of course the sawyers aren’t cutting up
  a giant penis (Letters, 6 August). It’s clearly a very large salami. Anne
  Cowper Bishopston, Swansea • A clear case of apartheight (Blackadder star Tony
  Robinson vents anger over ‘heightism’, 7 August). Tracey Gilbert Exeter • Have
  an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
  letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.
