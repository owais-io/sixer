  Nicolette Boele and Gisele Kapterian’s legal teams will each begin
  re-scrutinising 792 votes cast in the 2025 federal election later this month
  as part of a court challenge to determine whether the Australian Electoral
  Commission correctly determined Bradfield’s winner. Boele was declared the
  member on 4 June by a slim margin of 26 votes, defeating Kapterian, the
  Liberal party’s candidate, after a month-long count. The seat had been held by
  the Liberal party since its creation in 1949. In July, the New South Wales
  Liberal party confirmed it would launch a court challenge to determine the
  validity of a “small number of ‘line ball’ ballots” reserved and considered by
  the electoral commission during its recount. The federal court ordered on
  Friday that Boele and Kapterian’s lawyers be given three days each between
  10am and 5pm to examine the ballots, which will be numbered 1 to 792, and
  provide reasons for any they dispute. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  legal teams will each be given another day in September to re-examine the
  ballots before they will be allowed to agree or dispute any of the issues
  raised by the other team. A final list of the disputed ballots will be
  submitted to the court by 25 September. The court ordered strict rules for
  both legal teams to examine the ballots under the watchful eye of a court
  official. Neither team will be allowed to photograph or photocopy the ballots,
  remove them from the inspection room nor mark the ballots in any way. The
  hearing to determine Bradfield’s final vote count is scheduled in Sydney on 2
  October 2025, and expected to last one day. The nail-biting contest in
  Bradfield between the teal independent, Boele, and Kapterian delivered twists
  and turns through the four-week recount. The AEC had initially said Kapterian
  won on the first distribution of preferences by eight votes, before a recount
  was ordered. The final result followed rulings on ballot formality. At the end
  of the recount, Boele had 50.01% of the total vote, ahead of Kapterian’s
  49.99%, or a margin of 26 votes. Kapterian’s petition to the high court in
  July claimed 56 votes for the Liberal candidate had wrongfully been rejected
  by the AEC while 95 votes for Boele had been wrongfully accepted. The case was
  referred to the federal court earlier in August for a “just and efficient
  resolution”. Within 40 days of the election writ being returned, any candidate
  or elector from the seat can “petition” its result. That process involves a
  formal pleading to the court of disputed returns. For national elections, that
  usually means the high court. Only 50 challenges to House of Representatives
  results have been considered by the court of disputed returns since 1907.
  Kapterian had been appointed a shadow assistant minister in Sussan Ley’s
  Coalition frontbench.
