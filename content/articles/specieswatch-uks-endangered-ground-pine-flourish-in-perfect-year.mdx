  The ground-pine (Ajuga chamaepitys) is found in only 32 sites in Britain and
  is endangered. Listed as one of 15 priority species in Bedfordshire, it sits
  alongside charismatic species such as the hazel dormouse, water vole, brown
  trout and nightingale. A member of the mint family, it is a primitive plant
  that appears in only three places in the county. It was popular in Tudor times
  for its medicinal qualities and its smell of pine when crushed – hence its
  common name – although it is also called dwarf bugle, yellow bugle or
  bugleweed. This year so far will probably have suited this plant, as it likes
  heat and is drought tolerant, growing in bare disturbed patches of ground. It
  looks like a miniature pine tree, and likes the chalky soils found in the
  Chilterns. This is the peak time of year to see ground-pine, an annual plant
  that cannot stand frost and currently reaching its maximum size of 30cm. About
  this time, the yellow flowers with red or purple spots are disappearing,
  changing into tough seeds that look like small nuts. These seeds can survive
  in the ground for a remarkable 50 years, waiting for the right conditions
  before germinating, and so ground pine could still crop up in unmapped sites
  and surprise us.
