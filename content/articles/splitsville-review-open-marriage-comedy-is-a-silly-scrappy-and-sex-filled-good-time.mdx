  If you have spent any time on a dating app in hetero-world, you’ve probably
  encountered the type: enthusiastic, communicative, “partnered” with someone
  but “open” and very eager to talk about it. Or, rather, explain it – how it
  works, what the rules are, why it’s right for them. There is, of course,
  nothing inherently wrong with ethical non-monogamy – actually, there can be a
  lot right – nor should there be any universal expectations of romantic
  relationships besides mutual respect. But the reputation of ENMs in the
  straight dating world, however rightly earned, is suspect: expected
  condescension, mutually projected emotional superiority. Perhaps right in
  principle but also often annoying, and thus ripe for comedic skewering. Enter
  Splitsville, a new so-called “unromantic comedy” from longtime friends and
  writing partners Kyle Marvin and Michael Angelo Covino about a foursome of
  friends imperiled by loose boundaries. Owing to the protracted timeline and
  gargantuan feat of simply making a movie, the 104-minute film arrives a few
  years after buzz around open relationships percolated again, at least in New
  York, the city around which these four characters spiritually orbit. One might
  worry that Splitsville, directed by Covino, might feel a little passé, though
  that’s dispelled when the hapless Carey (Marvin) reveals that he and his life
  coach / wife Ashley (a ridiculously luminous Adria Arjona) met at a concert
  for The Fray, the Grey’s Anatomy-core band from the late 2000s – if this idea
  is washed, well, they’re in on the joke. Those jokes are delivered at a
  rollicking pace, with unexpected and at times jolting zigs that land better
  than they should, owing largely to actors who imbue enough sensitivity to
  would-be stock characters. Splitsville begins, fittingly, with a rupture – a
  “termination event”, according to the first of six chapter headings – between
  Carey and Ashley in the car. A desperate attempt at intimacy turns into road
  head hell – a car careens off the road and, credit to cinematographer Adam
  Newport-Berra, it’s initially unclear if it’s their car, another car or this
  whole movie. Ashley summarily pronounces the end of their marriage, and off we
  go on this bumpy but ultimately enjoyable ride. Bereft, Carey comically
  stumbles to the idyllic beach house of his best friend Paul (Covino) a
  confident-on-the-phone New York real estate guy, and his wife Julie (Dakota
  Johnson), a ceramicist who seems to draw from the same enviable store of
  billowy button-ups as Johnson’s character in Celine Song’s similarly wobbly
  romcom Materialists. Marriage, they console, is hard. So is divorce, even if
  you don’t have kids or money. They have both (Simon Webster plays their
  elementary-age son), and during a night drinking wine on their pristine white
  couch, reveal another achievement: open marriage, harmoniously maintained,
  they claim, by emotional maturity and a recognition that the physical is not
  as important as the romantic or spiritual. Their glass house gleams. Carey, a
  well-meaning guy, takes them at their word: why not sleep with Julie, an
  eminently attractive woman with whom he has some decent banter? (It helps that
  Johnson, a supremely sylph-like and languorous screen presence, can wring
  untold sensuality out of lines like “I do pilates”.) Jealousy, of course, is a
  nimble beast that obeys neither rules nor logic – “kinda like a werewolf
  situation” says Paul after he attacks Carey despite their mutual pleas for
  civil discourse. It’s a genuinely funny scene of physical comedy, id wrestling
  ego tackling sense, and the highlight of the movie, which has a similarly
  scrappy and haphazard approach to this comedy of entanglements. You can
  imagine where this spiral of envy – Julie flirting with Carey to attract Paul,
  Carey smugly enjoying Julie to provoke Ashley, Paul scheming with Ashley to
  make both their exes jealous – might lead, but Covino and Marvin slick the
  ride with a couple of zingers skewering the woo-woo talk of the supposedly
  emotionally enlightened; “I feel like the universe is out of alignment and I
  can’t adjust it,” bemoans a heartbroken chiropractor, one of many former
  Ashley lovers communed by Carey in a bid to demonstrate enviable magnanimity.
  Arjona, criminally underused here as in Hit Man and Blink Twice, shines the
  most in these scenes, able to embody the inherent silliness of our fickle
  attractions. Like Carey, some of the Splitsville’s gambits tests the
  audience’s magnanimity; for one, it is never really clear why these two
  gorgeous, independent women are with these knowingly pathetic men, whose egos
  are ultimately the butt of the joke. The film’s tricky balance between farce
  and sincerity teeters too precipitously in the final two acts, and one
  development in particular strains credulity, though it allows for time to pass
  before the musical chairs begin again. That Splitsville stays on track to the
  finish is mostly credit to chemistry – that ineffable, unpredictable thing
  between two, or three, or maybe four people, with just enough variation for
  each relationship here. Splitsville may take shots at the loose-boundaried,
  but they’re laced with truth: partnered or single, open or closed, we’re all
  working with the same raw material. Splitsville is out in US cinemas on 22
  August and in the UK and Australia soon
