  on Gaza, GP peak body says

  A growing number of Australian GPs have reported being subjected to frivolous
  or vexatious complaints to the health regulator about social media posts
  opposing Israel’s war in Gaza. Dr Michael Wright, president of the Royal
  Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), wrote to the Australian
  Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) on 14 August about “concerning
  reports” from multiple members of the college who had “publicly expressed
  views on the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza”. The GPs were
  subjected to complaints to Ahpra after “expressing opinions, including those
  of a political nature, on social media, or participating in activities
  criticising the treatment of civilians in Gaza”, the letter said. The letter
  said RACGP members advised that the resulting investigations had tied up
  doctors for months, but ultimately they had incurred no disciplinary action.
  Noting the “growing number of complaints about social media activity linked to
  the conflict in Gaza”, the RACGP asked Ahpra to “commit to fast-tracking the
  assessment and finalisation of complaints of this nature”. The college also
  asked Ahpra to elevate the prominence of its guidance on what constitutes
  reportable social media activity, including making “a proactive statement” on
  its complaint information page, which now contains no obvious reference to a
  practitioner expressing personal views on social media. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The college had longstanding concerns about prolonged Ahpra
  investigations and the toll unresolved complaints and drawn-out investigations
  took on the mental health of practitioners, the letter said. “Every effort
  must be made to improve the timeliness of investigations to minimise the harm
  caused to practitioners, particularly where a complaint is made vexatiously or
  deemed frivolous by Ahpra,” the letter said. This week, Guardian Australia
  reported that the high-profile physician Dr Stephen Parnis had stepped down
  from his role as chair of the board of the Medical Insurance Group of
  Australia (Miga) in an apparent response to concerns about his social media
  posts opposing the war in Gaza. A letter-writing campaign to Miga in support
  of Parnis noted that the medical board’s code of conduct acknowledged the
  rights of doctors to express their personal views in line with their ethics,
  and said the matter raised “questions about whether … Miga will support its
  members who are targeted by vexatious complaints”. Miga declined to comment on
  the circumstances of Parnis’s resignation, but its acting chair, Prof Owen
  Ung, said Miga respected the rights of members to hold and express personal
  and diverse views, and that it supported, represented and advocated for all
  its members, regardless of identity. Ahpra’s social media guidance for medical
  practitioners says: “Registered practitioners will not be investigated purely
  for holding or expressing their views on social media.” It contains examples
  of posts that would not usually warrant regulatory action, such as advocating
  for a peaceful resolution of a war or conflict, urging the protection of
  health workers and health facilities caught in a conflict or war, or calling
  for accuracy, truth and impartiality in reporting on a conflict or war. Wright
  told Guardian Australia prolonged investigation processes by Ahpra could cause
  “undue stress and reputational harm” to practitioners. “The RACGP agrees with
  Ahpra’s statement that practitioners should not be investigated for expressing
  their personal views on social media,” he said. A spokesperson for Ahpra and
  its national boards confirmed that it had received the letter from the RACGP,
  and said notifications had been made to Ahpra about practitioners covering “a
  range of political views expressed on social media”, including allegations of
  antisemitism and Islamophobia. “We are carefully reviewing social media use in
  line with our assessment process and expect to be able to respond to
  individual concerns quickly,” the spokesperson said. “This includes taking
  into account the significant distress felt by practitioners concerned about
  the safety of individuals within the Jewish and Palestinian communities in
  Israel and Gaza.” • Do you know more? Contact:
