  Luke McQueen: Comedian’s Comedian review – lord of mischief gatecrashes the
  popular podcast
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-11T20:00:03Z'
bodyText: >-
  The Comedian’s Comedian podcast, in which comic Stuart Goldsmith interviews
  one standup per episode, has now featured more than 500 guests. But never the
  tricksy comedian Luke McQueen. So this show opens with a real (or is it?)
  phone call to Goldsmith, during which McQueen demands to know why he’s never
  been on the podcast. The answer is of little consequence. McQueen has a sample
  of Goldsmith’s voice so he can create a compliant AI version of the podcast
  host and record his own episode live on stage. McQueen’s past work on stage
  and TV has delighted in playing with the truth. He pretended to be the scorned
  former double-act partner of Jack Whitehall, lured audiences into a show on
  the false promise that Frankie Boyle would be there, and publicly debased
  himself to win back a fictional girlfriend. His persona, simultaneously
  high-status and desperate for approval, returns in Comedian’s Comedian, while
  McQueen explores AI, ambition and the nature of artistic vulnerability in
  deliciously fresh ways. The conceit is that he wants this interview to
  showcase him as a “misunderstood artist”, but his AI interviewer has other
  ideas, and undermines him with questions about his lack of fame, family and
  driving licence. There is tension between the pressure for comedians to bare
  their souls to achieve success, and McQueen’s conviction that true bravery
  means taking risks that might not pay off. And it’s all cut through with
  enjoyably grotesque jokes about McQueen’s online activities, a memorable
  segment featuring alter ego Professor Franklin, and an uncomfortable encounter
  with McQueen’s teenage self. There’s a heady mix of introspection and mischief
  as McQueen pulls the rug multiple times, teasing that we might finally get to
  see behind the metaphorical (and at one point, literal) mask. Directed by
  Jordan Brookes, it’s relentless fun from a master of ambiguity. • At Pleasance
  Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
