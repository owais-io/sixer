  I wonder, sometimes, if Katherine Kelly misses her days as Becky McDonald in
  Coronation Street. Yes, Becky was a once-homeless, thieving ex-con who worked
  her way through the full panoply of soap storylines (abuse, miscarriage, drink
  problem, buying a child, marrying Steve, smashing up Tracy Barlow’s front room
  with a sledgehammer, a stint in the Rovers Return) before her departure from
  the cobbled streets for a new life in Barbados after a triumphant
  wedding-reception-wrecking, but, y’know, she got to have a laugh while she was
  doing it. This was during the early 00s, when Coronation Street still dealt in
  comedy as well as tragedy, recognising them as two sides of the same life
  coin, especially among the barmaids – fully formed or embryonic battleaxes all
  – gazing out on the world and its punters as they wearily pulled pints behind
  the bar. Since then, Kelly’s output has largely been one of unrelenting
  grimness. I can’t remember the last time she took a main role in anything that
  required a lightness of touch, let alone the exercise of her comic chops. And
  never more so than in her latest outing, the exhausting six-part thriller In
  Flight, in which she plays a desperate single mother, Joanne, whose son,
  Sonny, is sentenced to 15 years in a Bulgarian prison for a murder he swears
  he did not commit. Oh God, the suffering! The bleak, bleak suffering! Joanne
  sits opposite her boy as he cries and gibbers at the thought of spending years
  – if he is not shanked by breakfast time – in the terrifying hellhole run by
  thugs (it is safe to say that the Bulgarian tourist board will not be happy
  with In Flight). She goes home and trawls through his case files again, in
  preparation for a hearing that promises to be just as unsuccessful as all the
  others. It is almost a relief when the thriller proper begins; give me raw
  suspense over emotional battery any day. Joanne, a long-haul flight attendant,
  is approached by a menacing man called Cormac (Stuart Martin) and presented
  with a non-opportunity: start smuggling drugs for the cartel he represents and
  get her son protected in prison – albeit at the risk of life imprisonment or
  the death penalty herself, depending on whether she gets caught and in which
  country – or refuse and get him killed. Cormac hands her a suitcase with a
  false bottom, tips on how to disguise the smell of the heroin she is told to
  pick up in Istanbul, and vanishes into the night after warning her not to tell
  anyone. She tells Dominic (Ashley Thomas). He is a customs officer and they
  had a thing while he was separated from his wife. He is now back with his wife
  and trying to make a go of things, but he and Joanne still gaze at each other
  yearningly across the baggage carousel. Thus the stage is set for – well,
  hours of ordinary people being terrorised into acts of increasingly inventive
  desperation, really. There are lots of set pieces ratcheting up the tension as
  Joanne is nearly caught in the act again and again and kilos of drugs have to
  be hidden in tampon dispensers. Ambiguous conversations are held and more and
  moren trusted folk turn out to be corrupt horrors; you would simply give
  anything to make it stop. Partly so Joanne and Sonny’s anguish can end, partly
  so yours can. I don’t know if this counts as a successful thriller or not.
  Clearly, it works to the extent that the viewer is invested enough to be
  discomfited along with the characters. Equally clearly, the choking
  airlessness of it all is … not entertaining, especially with a script that
  dispenses necessary information in as unadorned a manner as possible. But I am
  a coward when it comes to the drug-smuggling thriller format. I feel as if I
  am being forced to watch a dog chew off its own leg to escape from a trap. But
  for those who love precisely that about it, In Flight will be a classic of the
  genre: the claustrophobic nature of it all, the endangerment of hapless
  innocents and the reminder of the evil that spreads untrammelled across space
  and history are a cluster of superb selling points. It’s brisk, it’s well
  made, it’s entirely harrowing. I wish you your strange, strange joy of it. •
  In Flight airs on Channel 4 and is available online now
