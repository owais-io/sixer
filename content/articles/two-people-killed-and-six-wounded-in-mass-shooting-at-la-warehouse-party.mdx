  Two people were killed and six others were wounded in a mass shooting at a
  warehouse party in downtown Los Angeles early on Monday, officials said.
  Police first responded around 11pm on Sunday evening to shut down a “big
  party” after officers saw a person possibly armed with a gun go inside a
  building in the city’s warehouse district, Los Angeles police department
  spokesperson Norma Eisenman told the Associated Press. That person was
  arrested at the scene, she said. Initial reports suggested the gunfire had
  erupted at an unofficial afterparty for Hard Summer, a weekend music festival,
  but organizers for the festival said on Tuesday that the shooting was
  unrelated to any of its events, and promoters of that afterparty said the
  incident happened several blocks away. LAPD received reports of shots fired at
  the afterparty around 1am on Sunday, after officers had cleared the area. When
  police returned, they found one person had died and learned multiple people
  had been hit by bullets, Eisenman said. One man died at the scene and a woman
  died at a hospital, the spokesperson said. Six people were taken to hospitals
  in unknown condition, she said. A man told KABC-TV that his 29-year-old son
  was one of the two people killed. There was no information about a suspect or
  a motive. Investigators remained at the scene for hours. Karen Bass, the mayor
  of Los Angeles, condemned the shooting in a social media post, saying: “This
  senseless violence and loss of life is devastating and those who are
  responsible must be held accountable. There will be no tolerance for violence
  in this city. My thoughts are with the victims and their families.” Bass said
  the investigation was ongoing and gang interventionists were “providing
  support for families and continuing the everyday work of keeping our
  neighborhoods safe”. Interventionists function as social workers and mediators
  who work within communities to resolve conflict and prevent violence. One
  attendee at the party, who declined to give their name, told the LA Times that
  it sounded as if “100 shots” had been fired, and said people scrambled onto
  the street in a stampede. The LA violence happened two days after four people
  were killed in a shooting at a bar in Montana, which was the ninth mass
  shooting of the year so far, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a
  non-partisan group. A gunman also killed four people in Manhattan in an
  incident that shook New York city last month, and multiple shootings broke out
  across the country on the Fourth of July holiday. This article and headline
  were amended on 5 August 2025 to clarify that the shooting took place at a
  warehouse party that was not affiliated with an unofficial Hard Summer music
  festival afterparty, as initial reports suggested.
