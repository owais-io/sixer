  Good morning. The White House has chosen a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr to
  serve as the acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC), a decision that comes as lawyers for the fired director, Susan Monarez,
  claim she will not depart unless Donald Trump himself removes her. A White
  House official confirmed to the Guardian that Jim O’Neill, the deputy
  secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), had been
  selected to temporarily lead the public health agency, giving Kennedy an ally
  in his efforts to overhaul US vaccine policy. The decision to remove Monarez
  has sparked further turmoil within the CDC. Four other senior leaders resigned
  over what they condemned as political interference in their work, budget cuts
  and the spread of misinformation under the Trump administration. What’s
  O’Neill’s background? Unlike Monarez, O’Neill does not have a medical or
  scientific background. He is a former investment executive, served as a
  speechwriter for the health department during the George W Bush
  administration, and went on to work for the tech investor and conservative
  mega-donor Peter Thiel. Democrats seek ‘immediate answers’ after reported
  arrests of firefighters by US border agents Patty Murray, the Washington
  senator, has called for the Trump administration to provide “immediate
  answers” about reports that two firefighters were detained by border agents as
  they were responding to a wildfire in the state. Federal immigration
  authorities on Wednesday staged an operation on the scene of the Bear Gulch
  fire, a nearly 3,600-hectare (9,000-acre) blaze in the Olympic national
  forest, where they arrested two people who were part of a contract
  firefighting crew, the Seattle Times first reported. The fire is the largest
  burning in the state. Authorities made the firefighters line up to show
  identification, the newspaper reported. One firefighter said they were not
  permitted to say goodbye to their detained colleagues. What did Murray say?
  The Trump administration’s immigration policy was “fundamentally sick”, Murray
  said. “Trump has wrongfully detained everyone from lawful green-card holders
  to American citizens – no one should assume this was necessary or
  appropriate.” Trump faces key legal test in effort to exert control over
  Federal Reserve Donald Trump’s battle to exert control over the Federal
  Reserve faces a key legal test today, with a governor of the central bank
  seeking a temporary block on his extraordinary attempt to fire her. Lisa Cook
  sued the US president yesterday, with her lawyers describing his attempt to
  dismiss her as “unprecedented and illegal”, and based on “pretextual”
  allegations. The case is widely expected to be ultimately decided by the
  supreme court. While it makes it way through the courts, Cook is seeking a
  temporary restraining order against Trump’s attempt to dismiss her
  “immediately” from the Fed’s board. Why has Trump been attacking the Fed? Most
  of the Fed’s policymakers, including Cook, have so far defied Trump’s calls
  for interest rate cuts. He has spoken of rapidly building a “majority” on the
  central bank’s board, calling into question the future of its longstanding
  independence from political oversight. In other news … Mexico’s senate
  descended into violence as two of the country’s top politicians shoved,
  grabbed and shouted at each other after a heated discussion about the presence
  of foreign troops. The US tariff exemption for package shipments valued under
  $800 officially ended today, raising costs and disrupting supply chain models
  for a range of businesses. Russian missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 23
  people and damaged the British Council and EU delegation offices, in the
  deadliest aerial assault on the Ukrainian capital since the Alaska summit
  between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. A judge ordered a new trial for three
  former police officers who were convicted in the fatal beating of Tyre
  Nichols, a young Black man whose death prompted intense scrutiny of Memphis
  police, nationwide protests and renewed calls for police reform. Stat of the
  day: Humans inhale as much as 68,000 microplastic particles daily, study finds
  Every breath people take in their homes or car probably contains significant
  amounts of microplastics small enough to burrow deep into the lungs,
  peer-reviewed research has found, bringing into focus a little-understood
  route of exposure and health threat. Don’t miss this: ‘Hash court’ and high
  drama – how weed became the US Open’s new distraction The US Open has always
  been the unruliest of tennis’s four grand slam tournaments, a place where the
  soundtrack is as much screeching trains, the roar of air traffic overhead and
  well-lubricated crowds as it is the thwack of racket on ball. In recent years,
  though, one distraction has cut through even the normalized bedlam that gives
  the tournament its character: the pungent and unmistakable odor of marijuana.
  Climate check: Heatwaves, wildfires and the hot summers that could change
  tourism With rising temperatures causing chaos worldwide, what does it mean to
  be a tourist in a world on fire? Holiday hotspots are being ravaged by heat,
  fire, floods and drought as fossil fuel pollution warps the climate. Stefan
