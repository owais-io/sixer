  King &amp; Conqueror Sunday, 9.10pm, BBC One James Norton and Nikolaj
  Coster-Waldau go head-to-head in a blood-splattered war epic about the years
  leading up to the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The opening episode features a
  lot of stage-setting, queasy moments of gory injuries and loads of names to
  remember. After England’s most powerful earldoms agree to crown Edward the
  Confessor (Eddie Marsan), we meet Harold of Wessex (Norton) and William of
  Normandy (Coster-Waldau) as they cross paths at Edward’s rather eventful
  coronation. The two start an allyship – one that won’t be able to last for
  long … Clémence Poésy and Emily Beecham complete an impressive cast as the
  future kings’ wives and hardy co-rulers. Hollie Richardson The Castle:
  Rebuilding History 7.30pm, Channel 4 How’s this for a challenging renovation?
  Norwich Castle dates back to the early 1120s, and a project to restore it to
  its original palace design has been going on for seven years, with cameras
  recording progress throughout. But even a Norman icon must succumb to the
  rules of TV makeovers: curators and craftspeople have limited time and money,
  so there’s a race to finish the job. Jack Seale Great British Classics at the
  Proms 5.45pm, BBC Two From Ralph Vaughan Williams’s The Lark Ascending to
  Benjamin Britten’s Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes and John Rutter’s
  Bird Songs, this Prom lovingly celebrates the land and seascapes of Britain.
  It concludes with Elgar’s Enigma Variations. HR RuPaul’s Drag Race UK: Meet
  the Queens 9pm, BBC Three Start your engines! RuPaul is about to introduce the
  12 new queens competing to be the UK’s next Drag Race Superstar in season
  seven. Bonnie Ann Clyde, Paige Three and Catrin Feelings are some of the names
  who will kick off the series proper next month. HR Gilgo Beach Killer: House
  of Secrets 9pm, Sky Crime Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson and the New York Post are
  the brains behind this grim and slightly schlocky true-crime documentary about
  a Long Island serial killer who preyed on sex workers. Its only real draw is
  an interview with the alleged murderer’s ex-wife, who is still convinced of
  his innocence. Hannah J Davies Marc Maron: Panicked 10pm, Sky Comedy With the
  end of his longrunning podcast WTF on the horizon, Marc Maron is not afraid to
  take aim at his bro-ish peers in this HBO standup special, declaring that “if
  Hitler was alive today, he’d probably appear on Theo Von’s podcast”.
  Elsewhere, he ably wrestles with heavy topics including his dad’s dementia.
  HJD Live sport Premier League Football: Everton v Brighton, 1pm, Sky Sports
  Main Event Followed by Fulham v Manchester United at 4pm. Tennis: US Open ,
  11pm, Sky Sports Main Event The 2021 winner Emma Raducanu is back at Flushing
  Meadows as the grand slam starts.
