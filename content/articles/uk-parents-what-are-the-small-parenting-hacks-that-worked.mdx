  Parenting. Full of joys. But also full of challenges. And while the bigger
  picture of how you attempt to shape a human is important, sometimes it is the
  little things that can pose the biggest headaches. Can’t get your four year
  old in the bath? And then can’t get them out? Battling with your teen on
  screen time vs homework? You are not alone. So let’s help each other out. Have
  you discovered a tiny parenting hack that actually makes a difference? We want
  to hear from you. Perhaps it’s the one phrase you started using that got kids
  to the table to eat dinner without much fuss. Or the one little change you
  made that reduced the time your teenagers spent on their phones. Whatever it
  is, we want to hear how it works, how you discovered it, and what difference
  it makes to your family life. If you’re having trouble using the form click
