  California governor Gavin Newsom says the state will draw new electoral maps
  after Donald Trump “missed” a deadline on Tuesday night in an ongoing
  redistricting battle between Democratic and Republican states. “DONALD ‘TACO’
  TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, ‘MISSED’ THE DEADLINE!!!”, Newsom’s office wrote on
  social media. “CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE ‘BEAUTIFUL MAPS,’ THEY WILL
  BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE
  HOUSE!)”. “BIG PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM
  — YOUR FAVORITE GOVERNOR — THAT WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR ‘MAGA.’ THANK YOU FOR
  YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! — GN,” reads the post. The post follows a
  series of snarky, all-caps tweets meant to mimic Trump’s social media writing
  style. Newsom was mocking Trump’s moniker, “Taco”, short for “Trump always
  chickens out”, prompted by his flip-flopping deadlines. Several states have
  waded into the redistricting wars, where Newsom and other Democratic state
  leaders had threatened to draw retaliatory maps if Texas were to move ahead
  with its redistricting scheme. Texas Democrats had left the state to stop
  Republicans from passing a new congressional map. The Texas senate passed the
  new congressional map on Tuesday, but it will not earn full approval from the
  legislature because of the quorum-break. Lawmakers are set to adjourn on
  Friday and Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has said he will immediately convene
  a new special session. In a letter sent to Trump on Monday, Newsom said he
  would prefer to leave the matter of congressional map-making to independent
  commissions, not partisan legislative bodies and emphasized that he would
  “happily” stand down if other states abandoned their redistricting effort.
  But, Newsom said: “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab
  unfolds.” Newsom’s office summarized the letter Monday in a mocking social
  media post to Trump: “DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU DO NOT STAND DOWN, WE WILL BE
  FORCED TO LEAD AN EFFORT TO REDRAW THE MAPS IN CA TO OFFSET THE RIGGING OF
  MAPS IN RED STATES. BUT IF THE OTHER STATES CALL OFF THEIR REDISTRICTING
  EFFORTS, WE WILL DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!” At
  a press conference with several quorum-breaking Texas lawmakers, as well as
  California’s legislative leaders, Newsom outlined his plan to ask voters to
  override the existing congressional maps drawn by an independent commission
  and accept a new proposal to create five more Democratic-leaning seats. The
  governor expressed confidence that voters would approve the plan and said the
  state legislature would act in time to get the measure on the ballot this
  November. Trump has defended the Texas plan, arguing that he is “entitled to
  five more seats” because he won the state’s popular vote in the 2024
  presidential election. The argument, however, is flawed – a popular vote win
  does not necessarily mean a president’s party is awarded more congressional
  seats. Despite Newsom’s appeal, the White House is seeking to enlist other red
  states in the redistricting clash. Last week, vice-president JD Vance traveled
  to Indiana, where he met with state Republican leaders to lobby them on the
  effort. Republicans have also targeted Ohio and Missouri. Lauren Gambino
