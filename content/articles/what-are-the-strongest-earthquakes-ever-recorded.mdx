  One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck Russia’s far east early
  on Wednesday, causing tsunami waves to wash ashore in Japan and Alaska and
  prompting calls for people around the Pacific to be on alert and move to
  higher ground. The 8.8-magnitude temblor set off warnings in Hawaii, North and
  Central America and Pacific islands south towards New Zealand. Here’s a glance
  at some of the most powerful earthquakes recorded previously, according to the
  US Geological Survey. 1. Biobío, Chile A 9.5-magnitude earthquake struck in a
  central region of Chile in 1960. Known as the Valdivia earthquake or Great
  Chilean earthquake, the largest ever recorded temblor resulted in more than
  1,600 deaths in the country and beyond, most of which were caused by the
  resulting large tsunami. Thousands of people were injured. 2. Alaska In 1964,
  a 9.2-magnitude earthquake jolted the Alaska’s Prince William Sound, lasting
  for almost five minutes. More than 130 people were killed in the largest
  recorded earthquake in the US and subsequent tsunami. There were huge
  landslides and towering waves that caused severe flooding. The event was
  followed by thousands of aftershocks for weeks after the initial quake. 3.
  Sumatra, Indonesia A 9.1-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami devastated
  south-east and south Asia and east Africa in 2004, killing 230,000 people.
  Indonesia alone recorded more than 167,000 deaths as entire communities were
  wiped out. 4. Tohoku, Japan A 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of
  north-east Japan in 2011, triggering a towering tsunami that smashed into the
  Fukushima nuclear plant. It knocked out power and cooling systems and
  triggered meltdowns in three reactors. More than 18,000 people were killed in
  the quake and tsunami, some of whom have never been recovered. 5. Kamchatka,
  Russia In 1952, a 9.0-magnitude quake caused significant damage but no
  reported deaths despite a tsunami that hit Hawaii with 9.1-metre (30ft) waves.
  6. Biobío, Chile An 8.8-magnitude earthquake hit central Chile in 2010,
  shaking the capital for a minute and half and setting off a tsunami. More than
  500 people were killed in the disaster. 7. Esmeraldas, Ecuador In 1906, an
  8.8-magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami killed 500 to 1,500 people. Its
  effects were felt for miles along the Central American coast and as far away
  as San Francisco and Japan. 8. Alaska In 1965, an 8.7-magnitudequake struck
  Alaska’s Rat Islands, causing a tsunami with waves 11 metres (35ft) high.
  There was some relatively minor damage, including cracks in buildings and in
  an asphalt runway. 9. Tibet At least 780 people were killed when an
  8.6-magnitude earthquake struck in 1950. Dozens of villages were destroyed,
  including at least one that slid into a river. There were also major
  landslides that jammed the Subansiri River in India. When the water eventually
  broke through, it resulted in a deadly 7-metre (23ft) wave. 10. Sumatra,
  Indonesia In 2012, an 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of
  northern Sumatra, in Indonesia. Though the quake caused little damage, it
  increased pressure on a fault that was the source of the devastating 2004
  tsunami.
