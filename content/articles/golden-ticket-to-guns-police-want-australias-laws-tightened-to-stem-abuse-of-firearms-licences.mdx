  of firearms licences

  In a small courtroom in Lismore in northern New South Wales in June, a senior
  firearms registry official gave evidence of a disturbing gap in Australia’s
  gun control laws. The court was exploring the circumstances of a
  murder-suicide, in which a father, Wayne Smith, shot dead his 15-year-old son,
  Noah, before turning the gun on himself. Smith was licensed to own a firearm
  because he had told authorities he was going to use it for recreational
  hunting, one of a handful of genuine reasons used to possess guns across most
  jurisdictions. As evidence to support this, he produced a letter from a
  property owner that said Smith had permission to shoot on his land. The
  landowner was acting within NSW gun licensing laws when they provided the
  letter – but it was akin to a golden ticket. Once obtained, it could be used
  in perpetuity as a basis to hold the firearm and hunt anywhere, not just on
  the property cited in the letter. It could be relied on without scrutiny even
  if the landowner died, or moved, or stopped wanting people to hunt on their
  land. All gun owners had to do was check a box when they renewed their licence
  saying there hadn’t been any change of circumstances around their permission
  to shoot. Smith is believed never to have used the gun on the property that
  had issued him the permission-to-shoot letter. He may have taken it to other
  properties to shoot on occasion, the court heard. “That would have been
  permissible based on the license that he held,” Janelle Green, associate
  director of the NSW police firearms registry, told the inquest. But the
  problem ran deeper. Until recently, police had no way to track how many
  letters were being issued by individual property owners. The recent
  introduction in NSW of a new system called Gunsafe changed that, and the
  registry quickly detected a problem. Green said a “high volume of letters”
  were found to be coming from a single property – not the one that had issued a
  letter to Smith. “As a result of that, the Firearms Registry made a number of
  inquiries with the licence holders who had used that particular piece of land
  in support of their genuine reason for holding a firearms licence and a number
  of firearms licences were revoked as a result,” she said. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The revelations have prompted calls for an overhaul of the state’s
  licensing laws, with concerns that permission-to-shoot letters are not being
  adequately regulated. Separately, in NSW, police previously identified a
  business that allegedly fraudulently issued permission-to-shoot letters that
  were then used by organised crime members to obtain gun licences. NSW
  authorities are now pushing for stricter requirements for permission-to-shoot
  letters. Green said police wanted changes to ensure fresh permission-to-shoot
  letters were obtained whenever a firearm licence was renewed. That would
  require gun owners to provide new letters, or updates or confirmations, from
  landowners every time, bringing it in line with requirements for other licence
  requirements. “For sport target shooting as an example, someone is required to
  participate in a set number of participation activities, shooting activities
  per year,” she said. “At the moment, there is not the same requirement … for
  someone to continue to substantiate based on a letter of authority or
  permission to shoot. The Firearms Registry is seeking to change that.” Similar
  problems were found in Western Australia before the state government updated
  its firearms legislation, with the former premier Mark McGowan saying there
  had been an “abuse” of the system that allowed people to access firearms
  licences with letters to hunt. WA Police told Guardian Australia five
  properties in the state had sold almost 10,000 permission-to-shoot letters,
  with one property alone selling 3,000 letters. In another case, a firearms
  dealer had bought a property in order to sell the letters along with guns.
  “This was a bastardisation of what was a genuine process, and people were not
  being criminal, but just taking commercial advantage where it shouldn’t have
  been,” WA police commander Lawrence Panaia told Guardian Australia. “If it’s
  legitimate, it’s not a problem, [but] if you’ve got thousands of letters being
  issued by one property, for example, what are these people doing if they’re
  not genuinely hunting?” WA has now outlawed the selling of hunting authority
  letters as part of its revised firearms act. Other state police forces say
  they are unaware of large volumes of permission-to-shoot letters being issued
  by individual landowners, although some states do not allow them to be relied
  on in the same way as NSW. In Victoria, police can’t collate data on how many
  permission-to-shoot letters are coming from individual landowners because they
  are stored in their internal systems as scanned images and would need to be
  manually opened and counted individually. Queensland police says it does not
  have the resources to obtain data on permission-to-shoot letters, but it is
  “not aware of a small number of landowners offering permission to shoot on
  specific land-holdings”. The convener of the Australian Gun Safety Alliance,
  Stephen Bendle, says laxity around authority-to-shoot letters could be
  contributing to the proliferation of guns in the community and undermining
  genuine reasons for holding a firearm. “We think that the system seems to be
  being exploited when authorities to hunt are not being validated, and we would
  hope that police and firearm registries try to validate those more
  responsibly,” he says. Research from the Australia Institute shows there are
  shortcomings in the system that allow people to claim recreational hunting as
  a genuine reason for holding a licence. There are more than 200,000 Category A
  hunting licences in NSW, but according to data from government body AusPlay
  only 11,000 people participate in recreational hunting, each year. Bendle says
  it was difficult to know the extent of the problem on a national scale, given
  the lack of data. “We have evidence … that it is being rorted and there is no
  reason to think that the same level of exploitation is not also happening in
  other states.” In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
