  Australia’s economy grew by 0.6% over the three months to June this year, and
  by 1.8% over the year to June. This outcome was better than expected by most
  economists and, if you’re a glass half-full type of person, you would have
  been happy to see that the economy has picked up its pace from a very
  lacklustre performance in 2024. However, while we economists may be very
  excited to dig down into the “national accounts” stats on such thrilling
  concepts as per capita gross domestic product (GDP), the implicit price
  deflators and fixed capital formation, you may well be asking yourself what on
  earth does any of this have to do with me? Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Well, quite a lot, as it happens. These figures not only tell us how well, or
  otherwise, we are doing as a nation, they also point to the quality of that
  growth. Are we growing just because there are more people buying more Labubus?
  Or are we creating greater national worth for each of us (as measured by per
  capita GDP) because more of us are being more productive? When growth is
  purely population-driven, it’s like an empty sugar hit from a soft drink. We
  use up precious resources without making anyone better off. The latest figures
  tell us that the economy may be growing, and at a faster pace in nearly two
  years, but that is largely because population growth means more people are
  buying stuff. Put another way, the economic pie is growing, but so too is the
  number of people who need to share it. Our living standards, as measured by
  per capita GDP, did creep up a teeny bit in the June quarter, but we are still
  worse off on this measure than we were in June 2022. There will be some people
  who will tell you that no growth is in fact the best thing for our planet.
  There’s no doubt that it would be far better if statisticians could
  incorporate measures such as environmental health, carbon pollution and
  wellbeing into our economic report cards. But it is naive to think that zero
  growth wouldn’t have dire consequences, particularly for the most vulnerable
  in our society who rely on government spending. When the economy stands still,
  or even shrinks, so do government coffers and their ability to fund support
  programs and infrastructure. But back to this week’s news. The national
  accounts also give us the valuable information on how our economy is shaping
  up in response to international and domestic trends. This, in turn, has
  potentially important ramifications for monetary policy, that is, how the
  Reserve Bank of Australia sets interest rates. And, let’s face it, we are all
  pretty obsessed with interest rates these days. In the case of international
  trends, Donald Trump’s tariffs haven’t marred our export performance, at least
  for the moment. And in the case of domestic trends, the RBA’s first two
  interest rate cuts in this cycle have seen households more willing to open
  their wallets than they have been for a long time. With more recent data
  showing that consumers are becoming less pessimistic, if not yet optimistic,
  the RBA will be watching this space closely. Should consumers lift spending
  too rapidly in coming months, this could put upward pressure on prices,
  limiting the potential for further interest rate cuts. You can see how
  economists have a way of turning good news into bad – no wonder economics is
  known as the dismal science. Over the past year or so, the government has been
  the main driver of economic activity. Indeed, Australia would have been in a
  recession last year had the government not jumped in to support the economy
  with a wide range of additional spending measures including on health, energy
  supports, and childcare. However, that level of spending was never going to be
  sustainable, and we are now seeing state and federal governments investing
  less in major projects as well as pulling back on their regular spending. But
  we need more business investment, not just consumer spending, to really lift
  our longer-term living standards. When measured as a share of the overall
  economy, business investment accounts for a little less than 12%, and it has
  been inching lower over the past 18 months. Back in 2012, that figure was 30%
  higher. Not exactly a recipe for the productivity and “growth mindset” that
  the government warns we desperately need, but at least the latest figures show
  productivity moving in the right direction. Overall, I would give Australia’s
  latest economic report card a score of B-. It tells us that spending is
  shifting from the public to the private sector, which is good news but, even
  as growth picks up, we are falling short on business investment and
  productivity growth. We certainly warrant an “improved performance” stamp on
  the card, but we are still a good way off from “excellent”. Nicki Hutley is a
