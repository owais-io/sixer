  Arne 2.0 Arne Slot was perspiring, pacing his technical area, about to implode
  with fury. St James’ Park was bouncing, having just exploded with joy. The
  night billed as a battle over Alexander Isak had been hijacked by a new young
  king of the Gallowgate. William Osula gambled on a flick-on and it arrived off
  Ibrahima Konaté’s back into the path of the grateful 22-year-old, whose guided
  finish past Alisson sparked wild scenes in the stadium. The script had been
  perfectly written – until it was torn up minutes later by another young
  attacking star. Rio Ngumoha, days short of his 17th birthday, powered home a
  100th-minute winner in the manner of Federico Macheda, to steal the headlines
  for himself. Alexander who? It was the second time in as many weeks that
  Liverpool had been pegged back to 2-2 having flattered to deceive. On neither
  occasion, against Bournemouth or Newcastle, would their opponents have been
  fortunate to draw. On Monday night the 10 men in black and white were, by
  every measure, the superior outfit. Liverpool may have found a way to win once
  more but this is surely unsustainable. You cannot bank on an 88th-minute
  volley from Federico Chiesa to bail you out every week (it was his first
  Premier League goal), nor is Ngumoha – talented as he may be – always going to
  conjure the proverbial rabbit from the hat in stoppage time. Slot will have
  woken up realising this, for all his gripes about the Magpies’
  ultra-physicality, and has a problem to solve with Arsenal lurking at the
  weekend. Football Daily’s prevailing thought, however, after a rip-roaring
  night in the sweaty summer air on Tyneside, did not relate to Isak, nor
  Ngumoha, nor Liverpool’s title credentials. It was a feeling of pure relief
  that, for the second week in a row, a dreadfully dull weekend of Premier
  League soccerball had been saved by Slot’s fantastically flawed side. On the
  opening night they served up that ding-dong against Bournemouth, a brilliant
  contest marked by the emotional tributes to Diogo Jota and Antoine Semenyo’s
  robust reply to alleged racist abuse. But the rest of the TV games were
  abject: Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle offered nothing, Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace
  offered one disallowed goal (but otherwise nothing) and everyone tried to
  glean far too much from Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal. The second weekend
  wasn’t much better, bar Tottenham’s Etihad ransacking. It all got FD a little
  concerned as, with our shortening attention span, we checked our phones
  mid-match for the 117th time. Maybe the cynics are right … has Pep Guardiola
  really ruined football? Is it all rigid structures and pointless pressing? Is
  this shiny billion-pound global product actually a bit boring? If Slot brought
  a sense of quiet control to Jürgen Klopp’s heavy metal football upon arrival
  at Anfield, perhaps the Dutchman has decided to turn the volume back up this
  season. The team he picked at Newcastle had Dominik Szoboszlai at right-back,
  just one holding midfielder and four out-and-out attackers across the
  frontline. OK, Liverpool only mustered five shots in the game (their lowest
  tally of the Slot era) with a woeful xG of 0.7 but they were very watchable.
  So while Reds’ fans may be worrying about Virgil van Dijk’s capacity to keep a
  flimsy back four together, neutrals can tune into Liverpool and guarantee
  themselves a cracking night’s entertainment. QUOTE OF THE DAY We got Jobe
  Bellingham because we built a trusting relationship with the parents over
  years. Now the family came especially over from England for their son’s first
  Bundesliga game and wanted to meet Jobe after the match at the bus. Then they
  stood at the entrance to the locker room and also spoke emotionally with
  Sebastian, which isn’t a problem at all based on the relationship. Everything
  was cleared up already today” – Lars Ricken, Borussia Dortmund suit, on the
  kerfuffle that followed the younger Bellingham being subbed off at half-time
  and a tunnel row between dad Mark Bellingham and sporting director Sebastian
  Kehl. Nothing to see here apparently, though Kehl has also reiterated the
  tunnel area will be restricted for players, coaches and officials, not
  families or agents. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Following his England idols, Wayne
  Rooney and Paul Gascoigne, in wearing No 18 at Everton, will Jack Grealish
  become Jazza to Wazza and Gazza? And why no love for Gareth ‘Bazza’ Barry?” –
  Mike McNally. Last Friday’s [full email version] missive on player naming
  rights hit the spot. Who else but Sir Alex Ferguson, José Mourinho, Arsène
  Wenger and me would have recognised the strap line vineyard without much ado.
  Personally I prefer Chateau Margaux but when times are tight Chateau
  d’Angludet meets my needs at £30/£40 a bottle” – Alex Cameron. As a big fan of
  the late, great Terry Pratchett I was pleased to see the appearance of
  footnotes in last week’s Football Daily. I’ve always found them entertaining
  when used as a device for the odd humorous aside. Oh” – David Bell. If you
  have any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of
  our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Mike McNally. Terms and conditions for
  our competitions, when we run them, can be viewed here.  RECOMMENDED LISTENING
  Max Rushden is joined by John Brewin, Lucy Ward and Jonathan Liew to cover all
  the fun/anguish (delete as applicable) from St James’ Park. Plus, a quick look
  at how the Premier League has started for Leeds, Spurs and Manchester United.
  RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September, join Max Rushden, Barry
  Glendenning and Football Weekly all-stars Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and
  Jonathan Liew for an evening of dazzling punditry at Troxy in London. The pod
  will also be livestreamed globally. Book now. This is an extract from our
