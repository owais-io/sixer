  A man accused of throwing a sandwich at a US Customs and Border Protection
  agent in Washington DC has been charged with assaulting a federal officer – a
  felony that could result in up to a year in jail and significant fines.
  Captured in a now viral video, the man authorities have identified as Sean
  Charles Dunn, 37, could be seen yelling “Fascists!” and “Shame!” at a group of
  officers as they patrolled the district on Sunday night. Daina Henry, a local
  transit police detective detailed the altercation in a criminal complaint,
  alleging that Dunn pointed his finger in the officer’s face and yelled, “Fuck
  you! You fucking fascists! Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city,”
  minutes before “winding his arm back and forcefully throwing a sub-style
  sandwich”. The incident erupted as tensions simmered over Donald Trump’s
  looming takeover of DC and his administration’s use of force to brutally
  achieve his anti-migrant agenda. On Tuesday, the president deployed the first
  round of federal agents, including officers from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement
  Administration and the Department of Homeland Security, along with dozens of
  national guard troops, in an operation he said is only just beginning.
  Invoking a never-before-used clause that allows a temporary federal takeover
  of the district’s police department, Trump called on Congress to grant him the
  power for a long-term occupation, but told reporters there were other ways to
  extend his control. “If it’s a national emergency, we can do it without
  Congress,” he said, speaking on Wednesday during a visit to the Kennedy
  Center. Trump has threatened to send federal officers and military personnel
  into other US cities as well. Dunn’s case, filed in the US district court in
  Washington, was taken up by the US attorney’s office headed by former Fox News
  host and Trump appointee Jeanine Pirro, who threatened to prosecute him fully.
  She has been outspoken in her support for the president’s plan to crackdown on
  crime. “President Trump has vowed to make DC safe and beautiful again,” she
  said in a video posted to social media, championing the federal deployment.
  “The president’s message to the criminals was: if you spit, we hit,” she said.
  “This guy thought it was funny,” she continued, referencing the defendant’s
  alleged actions. “Well, he doesn’t think it’s funny today, because we charged
  him with a felony, assault on a police officer.” She added that she and her
  team were going to “back the police to the hilt”. Dunn has not publicly
  commented about the charges or the incident and court records do not yet list
  an attorney for him or any scheduled court hearings. In the video, the officer
  does not appear to be injured from the sandwich, which the video-taker zoomed
  in on to show it was still fully wrapped in a Subway wrapper, where it landed
  in the street. The agent and others with him could be seen chasing the man
  after he threw the sandwich. Henry, in the criminal complaint, alleges Dunn
  was apprehended soon after and later said: “I did it. I threw a sandwich.”
