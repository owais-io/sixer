  A manhunt is under way for Dezi Freeman, a 56-year-old so-called “sovereign
  citizen” accused of killing two police officers and injuring another in the
  Victorian town of Porepunkah, which is home to about 1,000 people. Here’s what
  we know so far: About 10.30am on Tuesday, 10 police were attending a rural
  property in Porepunkah to execute a search warrant when they were fired upon.
  Two officers were killed and another was wounded. The officers killed were
  detective leading senior constable Neal Thompson, 59, and senior constable
  Vadim De Waart, 35. Thompson, who was on the verge of retirement, joined
  Victoria police in 1987 and spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood
  police station before working as a detective at the major fraud squad and the
  state crime squad. De Waart had only recently arrived in Wangaratta when the
  shooting occurred. He started his policing career at the Victoria Police
  Academy in late 2018 and worked for three years at St Kilda police station
  before joining the public order response team as a senior constable in April
  2023. The police officer who was wounded has had surgery. He was in a stable
  condition at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne on Wednesday morning. According
  to the chief commissioner of Victoria police, Mike Bush, the officers were
  “met by the offender, and they were murdered in cold blood”. On Wednesday,
  Bush named the suspect as 56-year-old Dezi Freeman, or Desmond Filby, whom he
  described as “heavily armed” and said he “understands bushcraft well”. He said
  Freeman had been able to run into the bush near the property alone immediately
  after the shooting. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Bush said it was believed
  Freeman was armed with multiple firearms, including long arms. He said police
  were still examining the scene to understand whether he took any additional
  weapons from police. The area around the town, about 300km north-east of
  Melbourne, is steep and mountainous. On Wednesday afternoon police released a
  new image of Filby and a description of him as Caucasian, 183cm tall, with
  medium build, short dark hair and brown eyes. Police said he was last seen
  wearing “dark green (khaki) tracksuit pants, dark green rain jacket, brown
  Blundstone boots and reading glasses”. Police have deployed hundreds of
  specialist resources, including air and ground, to find him. Bush described
  the search area as “very wide”, with Freeman likely to “know that area better
  than us”. He said there had been no sightings of him. The Victorian premier,
  Jacinta Allan, said Wednesday evening there were “huge resources” being put on
  the ground in North East Victoria. New South Wales police have also offered
  support. Freeman has a history of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign
  citizen” ideas. Bush would not confirm this but said he was known to police
  before the shooting. The Porepunkah community was being urged to stay indoors
  on Wednesday until Freeman was apprehended. Bush said the team who went to
  Freeman’s property was made up of local officers and members of the sexual
  offences and child abuse team: “It’s a large area, so it required a large
  number of staff to search the area and also search for technology.” It was not
  a “hostage situation”, Bush said, as Freeman’s partner and children had
  attended a police station on Tuesday evening. He said police had spoken with
  Freeman’s partner. On Tuesday Bush described the suspect’s address as a
  semi-rural property with a bus on site, which housed the alleged offender, his
  partner and children. The local council closed all facilities “effective
  immediately”, and Porepunkah primary school was in lockdown for a period on
  Tuesday. Its principal, Jill Gillies, said on Tuesday afternoon almost all
  students had returned home, adding it had been “quite an ordeal”. At a press
  conference Wednesday evening, the state education minister, Ben Carroll, said
  the school would open again Thursday, and counselling services will be
  available. The Police Association Victoria chief executive, Wayne Gatt, said
  “hundreds of our members” were continuing to “put themselves in danger right
  as we speak” in an attempt to apprehend the suspect. Allan said the thoughts
  of “all Victorians” were with the police, saying the response showed first
  responders’ “extraordinary bravery and courage”. The prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, said his thoughts were with the “police for the work they do, each
  and every day”. He said “the men and women who wear the uniform of the police
  take risks” for everyone. The mayor of Alpine shire, Sarah Nicholas, said in a
  video message that Tuesday had been a day of “deep sorrow and shock” for the
  community: “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and
  colleagues of the two police officers tragically killed in Porepunkah. Our
  thoughts, love and unwavering support are with you during this incredibly
  painful time.” The Victorian government has offered support to the local
  council and the Porepunkah primary school, including trauma counselling for
  any students, staff and affected families. • In Australia, support is
  available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 and Lifeline on 13 11 14 • This
  article was amended on 27 August 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated
  that a 25-year-old senior constable was among two police officers killed.
  Vadim De Waart was 35.
