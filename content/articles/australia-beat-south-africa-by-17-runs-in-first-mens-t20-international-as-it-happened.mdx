  They really shouldn’t have won, after Maphaka’s 4-wicket performance and being
  so many wickets down so early, but Tim David’s 83 saved the day. Then it was
  really South Africa’s game again when Stubbs and Rickelton were together
  during the chance, making 60 off the last six overs is pretty standard T20
  fare, but Hazlewood and Zampa blew that away. Rickelton top scored and got
  moving late, but his struggles earlier meant there was too much left to do.
  Impressive by Australia to fight out of trouble, and I think we’ve seen that
  they intend to be an all-out-attack team in this format. Could be some dynamic
  viewing coming up. The second match is one Tuesday, we’ll be back with you
  then. 20th over: South Africa 161-9 (Maphaka 3) Smart last over from
  Dwarshuis. His slow bouncer is quality, it gets up high, but so slow,
  painfully slow, it rolls out the side of Dwarshuis’ hand, off the little
  finger almost, and floats up like a jellyfish. A couple of those in this over,
  then pitches up last ball to beat Rabada’s swing and hit his off stump. Rabada
  out for 10. What a catch from Glenn Maxwell! That’s the matchwinner. Rickelton
  smashed that. It was six all the way, after an initial dot ball. And then it
  would have been 15 required from four balls, and possible. But Maxwell toys
  with gravity. He’s the bubbles in the champagne. We’ve seen him take so many
  of those boundary line catches, but this one he has to get serious distance in
  his leap, a couple of metres beyond the rope as he takes the two-handed catch
  stretched out in front of him, reaches one arm back to flick the ball up just
  before his feet hit the ground, then jumps back inside the field of play to
  complete the catch at the second point of contact. Magnificent. Never retire.
  19th over: South Africa 158-7 (Rickelton 71, Rabada 10) SA need something
  huge. It starts with a Rickelton outside edge, heaving drive at Ellis that
  flies for four. Slower ball hit to cover, they run hard for two. Two more
  squeezing out the yorker fine of deep third, four more reaching for the wide
  full ball to slice the drive! Ok, handy. Getting that last-over target down
  into the realm of the possible, the deficit is 25 now. Ellis helps SA with a
  wide. Lands his wide yorker from the next ball, Rickelton gets one run. Free
  hit for Rabada, needs to smash this last ball. Not quite, but he finds two
  runs to deep cover, gets the ask down to 21. It’s possible… 18th over: South
  Africa 142-7 (Rickelton 58, Rabada 8) Finally, Rickelton gets onto one! Can’t
  hit the first ball of the Hazlewood over but he heaves into the second, lifts
  it over the leg side for six. Slices behind point to follow, but the fielder’s
  there, he takes two. Then a single to the leg side. High full toss and Rabada
  can only skew one run to cover. Rickelton cloughs an attempted pull, it lobs
  to long on for one. Hazlewood ends his night with 3 for 26, fine work. SA need
  37 from two overs. 17th over: South Africa 133-7 (Rickelton 50, Rabada 7) Wide
  yorker from Ellis, Rickelton can’t reach it. Short ball but it’s slower to
  follow, so Rickelton can smack it but can only find the midwicket sweeper.
  Ellis masterclass in variations here. Rabada doesn’t have any such troubles
  though. Rocks back and punishes six over midwicket, a high bouncer but he gets
  u on his toes and collects it. That’s the cleanest sound off the bat for any
  South African tonight, it’s their first six of the night, and their No9 did it
  first ball he faced. Rickelton gets strike back, slides his 50th run down to
  deep third, but he’s made that 50 off 43 balls, so he hasn’t been able to give
  his team any impetus tonight. They need 46 from 18. 16th over: South Africa
  123-7 (Rickelton 48, Rabada 0) Four wickets in two overs from Hazlewood and
  Zampa. SA need 56 in four overs. Two in two for Zampa. Muthusamy plays the
  reverse sweep, over the top of this ball, hitting low on the shin in front of
  middle and leg. He reviews but walks off immediately, and the video shows
  three reds. No hat-trick attempt for Zampa because that’s the end of his
  allotment. And one for Zampa! The skiddy straight one, Bosch lining up a big
  cut shot but fooled by the ball that stays low and comes on straight rather
  than turning. Not sure how he was fooled, that is Zampa’s bread and butter. It
  hits off stump. 15th over: South Africa 120-5 (Rickelton 47, Bosch 0) What a
  luxury as a captain. You feel the game slipping, so you hand the ball to
  Hazlewood whose over gives you two wickets for one run. That takes the
  pressure of Zampa at the other end. Two in the over! Stubbs gone just as he
  was getting going, then the left-handed George Linde follows, a six-hitter who
  couldn’t get going. Hazlewood bowled that tough Test-match length, cramps him
  for room, first playing and missing, then hitting back to the bowler, and
  finally one a little shorter that seams away, squares him up, and Marsh has
  been smart enough to bring in a slip. Hazlewood makes the difference! Marsh
  goes to his blue-chip bowler and gets the desired result. Comes back, gets
  away with a wide full toss because Rickelton went the other way and couldn’t
  reach it. Slices a run to deep backward, bringing Stubbs on strike, and a
  cross-seam delivery from deep in the hand takes some pace off it, the bounce
  doesn’t get up, and Stubbs plays over it with his pull, bottom edging it to
  the keeper. 14th over: South Africa 119-3 (Rickelton 46, Stubbs 37) Zampa’s
  third over, and Stubbs gets onto one. Drags the lofted on drive and lands it
  just inside the rope for four rather than six, Green wasn’t that far away
  either. Hits his batting partner’s foot with his next shot, keeps the scoring
  to two. And carves the next over cover for four! Here comes Stubbs, he’s got
  set. A couple of singles, they’ve taken him for 13 from that over, 30 from
  three, it’s been a good night against Zampa for the visitors. 60 from 36
  needed. 13th over: South Africa 106-3 (Rickelton 44, Stubbs 26) Maxwell’s last
  over starts with a run to deep point. Then another streaky boundary, Rickelton
  dragging it to fine leg as he tries to play across the line of the ball. Picks
  off a couple of doubles, they help, either side of the wicket. Maxwell driving
  the ball into the surface, both of which are damp. No run from the last ball,
  10 from the over, 1 for 29 for Maxwell, 73 from 42 the equation. Totally
  doable with a big over somewhere, but they haven’t had one yet. 12th over:
  South Africa 96-3 (Rickelton 35, Stubbs 25) Can’t time a thing. Both batters
  wheezing at a run a ball. Stubbs tries to smack a pull from Ellis but drags it
  straight for one. Rickelton drags a drive to mid on that Marsh keeps to one,
  diving. Then finally, one sounds sweet off the middle! Stubbs off his pads
  meets a ball with more pace from Ellis, through midwicket. Then luck! Bottom
  edge past the stumps, four after nearly bowling him. Spoons back a leading
  edge past the bowler. So, 11 from it, of which one shot was convincing. SA
  need 83 from 48. 11th over: South Africa 85-3 (Rickelton 34, Stubbs 15) The
  South Africans still can’t get away, Dwarshuis keeps the parachute attached to
  the back of the innings with some slower balls and an angled into the pads.
  Single, leg bye, two, two… 10th over: South Africa 78-3 (Rickelton 30, Stubbs
  13) Gives the ball some air, Zampa, and Stubbs drills it back past him. It
  clips Zampa’s thumb, then clips the stump, and Rickelton was aware enough to
  get his foot back into his ground, but the bail didn’t come off. Might have
  skimmed the umpire’s trouser leg, too? But none of those contacts took enough
  pace off the ball to stop four. That helps SA. A brace and a single to follow
  for Stubbs, Rickelton can’t follow his lead though, twice kept scoreless
  before a single. Barely above a run a ball is Rickelton, 30 from 27. Halfway,
  they need 101 from 60 balls. 9th over: South Africa 69-3 (Rickelton 28, Stubbs
  6) Ellis to begin his work for the night, back of the hand, seam up, right on
  the money, Stubbs can’t score from it. A single to deep square to follow.
  Slower ball dips into the blockhole like a homing missile. Finally Rickelton
  manages a boundary, dragging a pull through the leg side, but only 7 from the
  over. They need 10 an over from here. 8th over: South Africa 62-3 (Rickelton
  23, Stubbs 4) Time for Adam Zampa, who celebrated his 100th T20 for Australia
  in his last start. Gives a little air, then a little flat one. Googly, cut off
  middle stump for one. Dries the ball, top edged sweep… oh, unlucky, it goes
  fine for four. Shoulder of the bat? Reverse sweep from Rickelton, just got a
  corner of timber on it. And unlucky for Zampa on the regular sweep, top edge
  again, Ellis at deep backward square is a couple of metres too deep to try
  diving forward. Eight from the over. 7th over: South Africa 54-3 (Rickelton
  17, Stubbs 2) More from Maxwell, interestingly. More fielders outside the
  circle now. Unlike the Australians, who just kept swinging as wickets fell,
  South Africa are keeping their powder dry. Needing about 10 an over, as they
  dink a few singles from the spinner. Dew a factor, Maxwell drying the ball
  with a towel between deliveries. Six from that over, three from his previous.
  6th over: South Africa 48-3 (Rickelton 14, Stubbs 0) Stubbs to the middle now.
  Last over of the Powerplay. Maxwell has quietened it down. Dwarshuis doesn’t
  continue that trajectory at first, getting big lift from a bouncer that costs
  him five wides over the keeper. But he does the job as Brevis plays a bad
  shot, trying to whip length through the leg side, through the shot too early,
  wrong line, and it comes off the leading edge high and not very far into the
  off side, where sub fielder Sean Abbott takes the catch. The two top
  wicket-takers for the Sydney Sixers combining for Australia. 5th over: South
  Africa 42-2 (Rickelton 13, Brevis 2) Dewald Brevis the next in, and almost the
  next out, just skewing his square drive over the infield with two players
  running back. Close to being caught. Maxwell with another Powerplay over, and
  it bears fruit. A few quiet deliveries, then Pretorius plays a halfway shot,
  chips it in the air, very little swing or follow through, but times it so well
  that it sails to long off. Halfway between knocking the single or attempting a
  six, and he falls into that gap. Out. 4th over: South Africa 39-1 (Rickelton
  12, Pretorius 14) Almost a run out! Pretorius is a liability with his pace.
  Should have been a straightforward single with Rickelton knocking the ball
  away, he’s slow getting through, and would have been out had Maxwell’s fast
  flat throw been on a slightly different line from backward point. Very
  bottom-handed player, diverts a straight ball over backward square for one,
  then Rickelton drags Dwarshuis away for a couple of leg-side boundaries. 3rd
  over: South Africa 28-1 (Rickelton 2, Pretorius 13) Hazlewood gets through a
  good over, pulled for four by Pretorius but he can’t score from the three
  balls following that. 2nd over: South Africa 23-1 (Rickelton 1, Pretorius 9)
  So it’s time for Lhuan-dre Pretorius, who was poor in the field and has some
  ground to make up with the bat. Glenn Maxwell to bowl his off-spin early in
  the innings. Pretorius dinks him over short fine for three runs, dicey shot
  that popped into the air. Maxwell goes upstairs for an lbw review against
  Rickelton that is umpire’s call on leg stump, the ball sneaking through on the
  angle to hit the left-hander’s back leg, but slightly too much angle. Maxwell
  around the wicket to him if you’re picturing it. They get a leg bye, and the
  other left-hander drives two and then four. The over costs 11 including the
  extra. 1st over: South Africa 12-1 (Rickelton 0) Oh, skipper. Blazing start
  for Markram. He times Hazlewood through cover first ball of the innings,
  flicks off leg stump when Hazlewood changes the line, then pulls when
  Hazlewood changes the length, three boundaries in the first five balls. But
  the sixth, Markram tries to punch off the back foot, the ball moves a touch,
  outside half of the bat, and it spins off the bat face towards cover, in the
  air. Green goes down on his knees to take the catch. We’re away with the
  reply. So… is that good? South Africa bowled Australia out, but 178 looks a
  very tall score after 75 for 6. Maybe South Africa mow that down in 16 overs,
  but it gives the home team a proper chance. A bit of grip in the wicket for
  changes of pace, but it might get more dewy for the Australians and make
  bowling tougher. 20th over: Australia 178-10 (Ellis 12, Hazlewood 0) Bosch to
  bowl the last, and Ellis starts it with a crisp straight drive for four.
  Misses a big swing at a full toss from the next. Now it’s his turn to refuse
  singles, after hitting down the ground. But he gets another full toss, high,
  and edges it into his body. No-ball, free hit, but the free hit is a good
  yorker, inside edged into the toe. Finally Ellis gets onto one, driven
  straight for six! Front foot out the way and essays the high elbow. Last ball
  of the innings, dragged into the leg side while a flying chunk of the corner
  of the bat spins away, takes the first, risks the second, and Bosch nails the
  direct hit at the striker’s end to deny him an extra run and to bowl Australia
  out. 19th over: Australia 166-9 (Ellis 1, Hazlewood 0) Two wickets in the over
  for Maphaka, who dots up Hazlewood with the last ball to finish with 4 for 20
  from four overs. Terrific figures for the 19-year-old. Left-arm pace in T20
  cricket, it’s a thing. Now we’re down to the tail, with Zampa driving a run
  through the off side, and Ellis allowed to face, though his next ball produces
  a leg bye rather than a run, off the pad outside leg, deflected to the off.
  Zampa times a lofted whip nicely behind square, but so nicely that it carries
  to Brevis. Finally they hold David. First ball of the over, Brevis drops a
  backspinning ball at deep backward square leg, it was dipping and curving on
  him. David refuses a run, so the next ball he tries to belt over midwicket,
  gets it high and straight instead, and Stubbs running in from long on doesn’t
  make a mistake second time. 18th over: Australia 164-7 (David 83, Ellis 1)
  Rabada will bowl his last. Driven straight, single refused. Tries the big pull
  shot but doesn’t time it, slower from Rabada, bottom edge into the body. Gets
  the next one though! Slower again, had to wait a bit, had to whip the wrists
  to get any power, but hits it square for four one bounce. Next one he slices
  over the off side, lands in a gap, thought they had time for two but David
  doesn’t risk it, accepts one run from the fifth ball. Ellis with a free swing,
  aims for six over square leg, caught in the deep… but it’s a no ball! So, free
  hit, but they didn’t run. Had they taken one, David would have had the free
  hit. They should have run two on that ball, honestly. That’s basic batting
  surely, you have to assume that the catch could be dropped. Missed out on two
  runs there. Ellis slaps the freebie over the bowler’s head, but they would
  only have got one, so David says no. 17th over: Australia 158-7 (David 78,
  Ellis 1) Ngidi returns, David punches straight but refuses a run. Digs out a
  yorker and calls for two, with nobody anywhere near the circle on the leg
  side. Sharp call. Rabada slips trying to pick the ball up running in, any
  rate. David follows it up with six! Straight drive, just to the off side,
  gorgeous timing. Flat and long. Drags the following ball and refuses the run,
  fourth ball. Keeps out the yorker from the fifth. Takes the run to end the
  over. Ellis has still only faced the one ball when he first came in. Three
  overs to go. Still time for a David ton if he can connect as desired. 16th
  over: Australia 149-7 (David 69, Ellis 1) Muthusamy to bowl his last. David
  turns down a single from the first two balls, he’s going to launch… and he
  does! And dropped at long on! That went miles in the air, way up, and Stubbs
  underneath it has too much time to think. Has to lurch back at the last
  minute, off balance, shells it just inside the rope. So David puts them on the
  roof! Next ball, just short enough from Muthusamy, and he belts it flat onto
  the tall stadium roof here in Darwin. Didn’t run while the catch was being
  dropped. Kept strike, used it, and uses it again, as Muthusamy goes full,
  getting cleaned out by David’s drive over wide long on. Another huge hit.
  Stubbs hides his head behind his arm. David takes a run to keep the strike.
  He’s 69 from 39. 15th over: Australia 136-7 (David 56, Ellis 1) Nasty short
  one from Maphaka, Ellis rides the bounce down to deep third, would have been a
  slip catch if they’d had the fielder in. David finds a run to keep the strike.
  Five overs to go. When does David launch? Rotates the strike first ball does
  Dwarshuis, little bottom edge past his leg stump, David sharp and racing
  through to beat the keeper Rickelton in a foot race. Thumps the cut shot, but
  this time Pretorius does decide to do some fielding. He’s not a svelte figure
  there in the deep, slow across the ground. But when Dwarshuis tries to clear
  mid off, he scuffs the catch to mid off. 14th over: Australia 132-6 (David 54,
  Dwarshuis 16) Rabada is back, Dwarshuis does the job with a first-ball single,
  an edge poke past the keeper. Two runs to cover for David, who then crushes
  the pull shot along the ground but it’s straight to the deep fielder.
  Dwarshuis can’t beat point on his first attempt, but does so after a wide,
  nicely placed behind that position and running away for four. Less ideal that
  he keeps the strike with a dinked pull shot down the ground. 13th over:
  Australia 122-6 (David 51, Dwarshuis 10) Ellis, Zampa, Hazlewood, not much
  batting to come. It’s a weak bottom four by Australian standards. Corbin Bosch
  trades a few singles, but David finds the six ball eventually, short and not
  nailed, high on the bat, but still gets the distance to the fence, where a
  young bloke with a moustache, holding two cans of beer in his right hand,
  takes the catch casually in the left. David drives two runs past the bowler,
  then smokes four through cover, and raises his fifty. What a knock in the
  circumstances. He’s the Solo Man at the moment, bring him a kayak. 12th over:
  Australia 108-6 (David 38, Dwarshuis 9) “That’s the power of David!” yells the
  TV, channelling the Book of Samuel. Big Tim hits the shot that Maxwell was
  trying, sending Muthusamy miles over deep cover onto a nearby roof. Monster
  hit. The spinner keeps him quiet afterwards though, a couple of singles. Nine
  from that over, but 1 for 11 from three overs is still a fine night in this
  format. 11th over: Australia 99-6 (David 30, Dwarshuis 8) “Come on George,
  just give us your best here, George,” is very wholesome wicketkeeper chat as
  Linde comes back on. Dwarshuis gets off strike second ball. David gets rid of
  the helmet, goes bareheaded in the Darwin humidity. Hair shining with
  moisture. But doesn’t get anything to belt. Can only stab a run off his pads,
  Linde teasing away at the leg stump. Drops too short to Dwarshuis though who’s
  able to club a pull for four. What’s going on with Pretorius though? He’s out
  at deep mid and just trots to pick it up, didn’t make any effort to stop that.
  “Andre, move!” is the less friendly call from the keeper. Linde is pissed, but
  follows up with some trash bowling, five wides down the leg side. 10th over:
  Australia 88-6 (David 29, Dwarshuis 3) And somehow, in this helter-skelter
  match, Muthusamy bowls an over conceding one run. Dwarshuis soaks up most of
  it, David can’t keep strike at the end. 9th over: Australia 87-6 (David 29,
  Dwarshuis 2) Maphaka continues, glided away by Dwarshuis for one. David turns
  down a single, interestingly. Justifies that next ball when he nails a flat
  pull shot for six! Barely got off the ground, that one, incredible power over
  midwicket. Then drives four through the covers with another heavy hit. 8th
  over: Australia 76-6 (David 19, Dwarshuis 1) Ben Dwarshuis at the crease in
  the 8th over? Huh. A lot of work for Tim David to do from here. Maxwell all
  over the shop against Muthusamy’s left-arm spin. Tries to reverse a ball that
  is angled towards the leg side and pitching outside leg stump, there’s no way
  to drag that line to the off side. Tries leaving one in a similar arc,
  thinking it’s wide, but it hits the back of his boot. Then gets width and
  drills the lofted square drive, but Linde runs around in the deep and dives to
  take the catch firmly enough to keep it from jarring out as his elbows hit the
  ground. Good get. 7th over: Australia 75-5 (David 19, Maxwell 1) Glenn Maxwell
  to the crease, batting seven, in the seventh over. Steers the pace away for
  one. David can’t get anything off the last ball, after a wide. Maphaka comes
  on with the fielding restrictions expired. Left-armer, 19 years old, he falls
  away in his bowling stride and really yanks his shoulder through the action to
  give the ball energy. After three balls and a couple of singles, that energy
  produces the pace to go through Owen, backing away and trying to flay through
  the off side, but playing off his stumps as a right-hander facing a
  left-armer, and it knocks out off stump. Fierce bowling! 6th over: Australia
  71-4 (David 18, Owen 1) Mitch Owen in, another destructive player, who
  mistimes another slower ball but isn’t trying to mash it, so he gets a run
  down the ground. Four wickets and 71 runs in the Powerplay. My word. Green
  keeps going. Plays the shot that got Marsh out, but connects so cleanly it
  goes 20 rows back, off the hip over deep backward. Ngidi pitches up next, so
  Green smacks four over long off. He’s 35 off 10 balls. Ngidi takes a deep
  breath, quietens Green down with a slower ball before a perfect yorker, and
  after those two dots he goes the slower ball again at 114 kph. Big drive by
  Green, miscues it because of the pace, and it goes off the toe of bat that was
  already through the shot, and therefore straight up, and the keeper runs
  around into the off side to claim it. 5th over: Australia 60-3 (Green 25,
  David 18) So the run rate’s up and the wickets are falling. David doesn’t mind
  the latter, he maintains the former, thrashing Corbin Bosch’s first ball over
  backward point for four. It was full and wide but David has the reach to fetch
  what Travis Head couldn’t earlier. Bosch, tall and blond and built, looks
  annoyed, bowls the next into leg stump, and has David hitting to his
  outfielder at deep backward. That’s more the plan. No plan is containing Green
  though, who makes it look so easy slotting another six over long on. He’s 24
  off 7 balls! Then races a single. He’s six foot seventy-three but he’s also
  quick enough. One ball to come, and David drives it over cover for six! Oh
  boy. Three down and they’re going at 12 an over. The ground DJ is playing
  Chappell Roan. Hot to Go. 4th over: Australia 42-3 (Green 18, David 7) Tim
  David gets going just like Green. Blocks his first ball from Rabada, but skips
  down and belts his second off a length for six! Ball angled in at leg stump
  but he made enough room to swing through and middle it. Drags a single to mid
  on. Rabada bowls a fat full toss but Green misses it down the leg side. Gets
  another chance with a wide, and he whacks the replacement delivery off the
  pads for four through midwicket. Rabada strikes again! Gets the other senior
  opener too. On the hip, Marsh tries to lift a pull shot up and over deep
  backward. He gets it up, way up, but not over, and Maphaka does a good job in
  the deep to hold onto the ball coming down with snow on it. 3rd over:
  Australia 15-2 (Marsh 13, Green 14) No such worries for Cameron Green! Walks
  in and and ruins Linde’s over immediately. First ball is cracked to the point
  fielder, so the second ball he corrects and places a similar shot for four.
  Picks up the next over long on for four, then cleans out the following one for
  an even bigger hit in the same direction, six. Easy for Green, he’s 14 off 4!
  Golden duck! Early spin for South Africa, if you can call it that, but George
  Linde gets the slightest bit of purchase with his left-arm ortho dart from
  around the wicket. Stops in the pitch, perhaps, it’s tight on the line of off
  stump, Inglis leans away and thrashes an aerial cut, and Muthusamy is jumping
  and off balance at backward point but holds the catch. 2nd over: Australia
  15-1 (Marsh 12) Kagiso Rabada to be the other opening bowler, bowls short on
  the hip and Marsh belts it aerially behind square leg, but it’s slapped down
  by Ngidi in the deep after it bounces, saving the boundary. One run, then
  Rabada uses the angle across Head to hide the ball just out of his range,
  right on the wide line, and Head leaning back has two huge carves and misses
  both. Tighter line, cracks the cut, but straight to the fielder in the ring.
  Then again! Almost carries, that one… oh, it did. Flat low cut shot into his
  hands at ankle height. But straight away, the last ball of the over, Rabada
  gets his man. Full, wide outside off, squeezed out by Head reaching for it,
  and Maphaka at backward point lets the ball bobble off his hands into his
  stomach, then holds it. What a great over. 1st over: Australia 14-0 (Marsh 11,
  Head 2) Starts with a bang! Not a convincing bang, Marsh gets that straight
  drive low on the bat, near the toe, but still has enough power in his huge
  shoulders to get it over long off for six. It hung in the air like wet laundry
  but plopped down in a pile on the good side of the rope. Lungi Ngidi follows
  up with a horrible leg side wide, way down and nearly beats the keeper
  swinging away, then short width that Marsh crunches over cover for four. Ngidi
  eventually gets things right, with an in-ducker to cramp Marsh, then the right
  line to make Marsh and then Head hit to Ngidi’s boundary rider at deep
  backward point. Interesting new configuration for Australia, Marsh and Head at
  the top of the order. Both have had some big returns opening for Australia in
  one-day cricket in the past couple of years, especially the T20 World Cup, so
  after some recent experimenting, Australia are going for the tested senior
  players in the run-up to the next T20 global tournament early next year. On a
  pitch you don’t know, chase. That’s the wisdom. Australia Travis Head Mitchell

  This is a funny sequel to the World Test Championship final that South Africa
  won. And it’s a funny time to be playing in Australia, in early August. But
  that’s what we’re doing: Australia v South Africa winter cricket in Darwin, a
  T20 series, in the tropical north. Let’s slice a pineapple.

They really shouldn’t have won, after Maphaka’s 4-wicket performance and being so many wickets down so early, but Tim David’s 83 saved the day. Then it was really South Africa’s game again when Stubbs and Rickelton were together during the chance, making 60 off the last six overs is pretty standard T20 fare, but Hazlewood and Zampa blew that away. Rickelton top scored and got moving late, but his struggles earlier meant there was too much left to do. Impressive by Australia to fight out of trouble, and I think we’ve seen that they intend to be an all-out-attack team in this format. Could be some dynamic viewing coming up. The second match is one Tuesday, we’ll be back with you then. 20th over: South Africa 161-9 (Maphaka 3) Smart last over from Dwarshuis. His slow bouncer is quality, it gets up high, but so slow, painfully slow, it rolls out the side of Dwarshuis’ hand, off the little finger almost, and floats up like a jellyfish. A couple of those in this over, then pitches up last ball to beat Rabada’s swing and hit his off stump. Rabada out for 10. What a catch from Glenn Maxwell! That’s the matchwinner. Rickelton smashed that. It was six all the way, after an initial dot ball. And then it would have been 15 required from four balls, and possible. But Maxwell toys with gravity. He’s the bubbles in the champagne. We’ve seen him take so many of those boundary line catches, but this one he has to get serious distance in his leap, a couple of metres beyond the rope as he takes the two-handed catch stretched out in front of him, reaches one arm back to flick the ball up just before his feet hit the ground, then jumps back inside the field of play to complete the catch at the second point of contact. Magnificent. Never retire. 19th over: South Africa 158-7 (Rickelton 71, Rabada 10) SA need something huge. It starts with a Rickelton outside edge, heaving drive at Ellis that flies for four. Slower ball hit to cover, they run hard for two. Two more squeezing out the yorker fine of deep third, four more reaching for the wide full ball to slice the drive! Ok, handy. Getting that last-over target down into the realm of the possible, the deficit is 25 now. Ellis helps SA with a wide. Lands his wide yorker from the next ball, Rickelton gets one run. Free hit for Rabada, needs to smash this last ball. Not quite, but he finds two runs to deep cover, gets the ask down to 21. It’s possible… 18th over: South Africa 142-7 (Rickelton 58, Rabada 8) Finally, Rickelton gets onto one! Can’t hit the first ball of the Hazlewood over but he heaves into the second, lifts it over the leg side for six. Slices behind point to follow, but the fielder’s there, he takes two. Then a single to the leg side. High full toss and Rabada can only skew one run to cover. Rickelton cloughs an attempted pull, it lobs to long on for one. Hazlewood ends his night with 3 for 26, fine work. SA need 37 from two overs. 17th over: South Africa 133-7 (Rickelton 50, Rabada 7) Wide yorker from Ellis, Rickelton can’t reach it. Short ball but it’s slower to follow, so Rickelton can smack it but can only find the midwicket sweeper. Ellis masterclass in variations here. Rabada doesn’t have any such troubles though. Rocks back and punishes six over midwicket, a high bouncer but he gets u on his toes and collects it. That’s the cleanest sound off the bat for any South African tonight, it’s their first six of the night, and their No9 did it first ball he faced. Rickelton gets strike back, slides his 50th run down to deep third, but he’s made that 50 off 43 balls, so he hasn’t been able to give his team any impetus tonight. They need 46 from 18. 16th over: South Africa 123-7 (Rickelton 48, Rabada 0) Four wickets in two overs from Hazlewood and Zampa. SA need 56 in four overs. Two in two for Zampa. Muthusamy plays the reverse sweep, over the top of this ball, hitting low on the shin in front of middle and leg. He reviews but walks off immediately, and the video shows three reds. No hat-trick attempt for Zampa because that’s the end of his allotment. And one for Zampa! The skiddy straight one, Bosch lining up a big cut shot but fooled by the ball that stays low and comes on straight rather than turning. Not sure how he was fooled, that is Zampa’s bread and butter. It hits off stump. 15th over: South Africa 120-5 (Rickelton 47, Bosch 0) What a luxury as a captain. You feel the game slipping, so you hand the ball to Hazlewood whose over gives you two wickets for one run. That takes the pressure of Zampa at the other end. Two in the over! Stubbs gone just as he was getting going, then the left-handed George Linde follows, a six-hitter who couldn’t get going. Hazlewood bowled that tough Test-match length, cramps him for room, first playing and missing, then hitting back to the bowler, and finally one a little shorter that seams away, squares him up, and Marsh has been smart enough to bring in a slip. Hazlewood makes the difference! Marsh goes to his blue-chip bowler and gets the desired result. Comes back, gets away with a wide full toss because Rickelton went the other way and couldn’t reach it. Slices a run to deep backward, bringing Stubbs on strike, and a cross-seam delivery from deep in the hand takes some pace off it, the bounce doesn’t get up, and Stubbs plays over it with his pull, bottom edging it to the keeper. 14th over: South Africa 119-3 (Rickelton 46, Stubbs 37) Zampa’s third over, and Stubbs gets onto one. Drags the lofted on drive and lands it just inside the rope for four rather than six, Green wasn’t that far away either. Hits his batting partner’s foot with his next shot, keeps the scoring to two. And carves the next over cover for four! Here comes Stubbs, he’s got set. A couple of singles, they’ve taken him for 13 from that over, 30 from three, it’s been a good night against Zampa for the visitors. 60 from 36 needed. 13th over: South Africa 106-3 (Rickelton 44, Stubbs 26) Maxwell’s last over starts with a run to deep point. Then another streaky boundary, Rickelton dragging it to fine leg as he tries to play across the line of the ball. Picks off a couple of doubles, they help, either side of the wicket. Maxwell driving the ball into the surface, both of which are damp. No run from the last ball, 10 from the over, 1 for 29 for Maxwell, 73 from 42 the equation. Totally doable with a big over somewhere, but they haven’t had one yet. 12th over: South Africa 96-3 (Rickelton 35, Stubbs 25) Can’t time a thing. Both batters wheezing at a run a ball. Stubbs tries to smack a pull from Ellis but drags it straight for one. Rickelton drags a drive to mid on that Marsh keeps to one, diving. Then finally, one sounds sweet off the middle! Stubbs off his pads meets a ball with more pace from Ellis, through midwicket. Then luck! Bottom edge past the stumps, four after nearly bowling him. Spoons back a leading edge past the bowler. So, 11 from it, of which one shot was convincing. SA need 83 from 48. 11th over: South Africa 85-3 (Rickelton 34, Stubbs 15) The South Africans still can’t get away, Dwarshuis keeps the parachute attached to the back of the innings with some slower balls and an angled into the pads. Single, leg bye, two, two… 10th over: South Africa 78-3 (Rickelton 30, Stubbs 13) Gives the ball some air, Zampa, and Stubbs drills it back past him. It clips Zampa’s thumb, then clips the stump, and Rickelton was aware enough to get his foot back into his ground, but the bail didn’t come off. Might have skimmed the umpire’s trouser leg, too? But none of those contacts took enough pace off the ball to stop four. That helps SA. A brace and a single to follow for Stubbs, Rickelton can’t follow his lead though, twice kept scoreless before a single. Barely above a run a ball is Rickelton, 30 from 27. Halfway, they need 101 from 60 balls. 9th over: South Africa 69-3 (Rickelton 28, Stubbs 6) Ellis to begin his work for the night, back of the hand, seam up, right on the money, Stubbs can’t score from it. A single to deep square to follow. Slower ball dips into the blockhole like a homing missile. Finally Rickelton manages a boundary, dragging a pull through the leg side, but only 7 from the over. They need 10 an over from here. 8th over: South Africa 62-3 (Rickelton 23, Stubbs 4) Time for Adam Zampa, who celebrated his 100th T20 for Australia in his last start. Gives a little air, then a little flat one. Googly, cut off middle stump for one. Dries the ball, top edged sweep… oh, unlucky, it goes fine for four. Shoulder of the bat? Reverse sweep from Rickelton, just got a corner of timber on it. And unlucky for Zampa on the regular sweep, top edge again, Ellis at deep backward square is a couple of metres too deep to try diving forward. Eight from the over. 7th over: South Africa 54-3 (Rickelton 17, Stubbs 2) More from Maxwell, interestingly. More fielders outside the circle now. Unlike the Australians, who just kept swinging as wickets fell, South Africa are keeping their powder dry. Needing about 10 an over, as they dink a few singles from the spinner. Dew a factor, Maxwell drying the ball with a towel between deliveries. Six from that over, three from his previous. 6th over: South Africa 48-3 (Rickelton 14, Stubbs 0) Stubbs to the middle now. Last over of the Powerplay. Maxwell has quietened it down. Dwarshuis doesn’t continue that trajectory at first, getting big lift from a bouncer that costs him five wides over the keeper. But he does the job as Brevis plays a bad shot, trying to whip length through the leg side, through the shot too early, wrong line, and it comes off the leading edge high and not very far into the off side, where sub fielder Sean Abbott takes the catch. The two top wicket-takers for the Sydney Sixers combining for Australia. 5th over: South Africa 42-2 (Rickelton 13, Brevis 2) Dewald Brevis the next in, and almost the next out, just skewing his square drive over the infield with two players running back. Close to being caught. Maxwell with another Powerplay over, and it bears fruit. A few quiet deliveries, then Pretorius plays a halfway shot, chips it in the air, very little swing or follow through, but times it so well that it sails to long off. Halfway between knocking the single or attempting a six, and he falls into that gap. Out. 4th over: South Africa 39-1 (Rickelton 12, Pretorius 14) Almost a run out! Pretorius is a liability with his pace. Should have been a straightforward single with Rickelton knocking the ball away, he’s slow getting through, and would have been out had Maxwell’s fast flat throw been on a slightly different line from backward point. Very bottom-handed player, diverts a straight ball over backward square for one, then Rickelton drags Dwarshuis away for a couple of leg-side boundaries. 3rd over: South Africa 28-1 (Rickelton 2, Pretorius 13) Hazlewood gets through a good over, pulled for four by Pretorius but he can’t score from the three balls following that. 2nd over: South Africa 23-1 (Rickelton 1, Pretorius 9) So it’s time for Lhuan-dre Pretorius, who was poor in the field and has some ground to make up with the bat. Glenn Maxwell to bowl his off-spin early in the innings. Pretorius dinks him over short fine for three runs, dicey shot that popped into the air. Maxwell goes upstairs for an lbw review against Rickelton that is umpire’s call on leg stump, the ball sneaking through on the angle to hit the left-hander’s back leg, but slightly too much angle. Maxwell around the wicket to him if you’re picturing it. They get a leg bye, and the other left-hander drives two and then four. The over costs 11 including the extra. 1st over: South Africa 12-1 (Rickelton 0) Oh, skipper. Blazing start for Markram. He times Hazlewood through cover first ball of the innings, flicks off leg stump when Hazlewood changes the line, then pulls when Hazlewood changes the length, three boundaries in the first five balls. But the sixth, Markram tries to punch off the back foot, the ball moves a touch, outside half of the bat, and it spins off the bat face towards cover, in the air. Green goes down on his knees to take the catch. We’re away with the reply. So… is that good? South Africa bowled Australia out, but 178 looks a very tall score after 75 for 6. Maybe South Africa mow that down in 16 overs, but it gives the home team a proper chance. A bit of grip in the wicket for changes of pace, but it might get more dewy for the Australians and make bowling tougher. 20th over: Australia 178-10 (Ellis 12, Hazlewood 0) Bosch to bowl the last, and Ellis starts it with a crisp straight drive for four. Misses a big swing at a full toss from the next. Now it’s his turn to refuse singles, after hitting down the ground. But he gets another full toss, high, and edges it into his body. No-ball, free hit, but the free hit is a good yorker, inside edged into the toe. Finally Ellis gets onto one, driven straight for six! Front foot out the way and essays the high elbow. Last ball of the innings, dragged into the leg side while a flying chunk of the corner of the bat spins away, takes the first, risks the second, and Bosch nails the direct hit at the striker’s end to deny him an extra run and to bowl Australia out. 19th over: Australia 166-9 (Ellis 1, Hazlewood 0) Two wickets in the over for Maphaka, who dots up Hazlewood with the last ball to finish with 4 for 20 from four overs. Terrific figures for the 19-year-old. Left-arm pace in T20 cricket, it’s a thing. Now we’re down to the tail, with Zampa driving a run through the off side, and Ellis allowed to face, though his next ball produces a leg bye rather than a run, off the pad outside leg, deflected to the off. Zampa times a lofted whip nicely behind square, but so nicely that it carries to Brevis. Finally they hold David. First ball of the over, Brevis drops a backspinning ball at deep backward square leg, it was dipping and curving on him. David refuses a run, so the next ball he tries to belt over midwicket, gets it high and straight instead, and Stubbs running in from long on doesn’t make a mistake second time. 18th over: Australia 164-7 (David 83, Ellis 1) Rabada will bowl his last. Driven straight, single refused. Tries the big pull shot but doesn’t time it, slower from Rabada, bottom edge into the body. Gets the next one though! Slower again, had to wait a bit, had to whip the wrists to get any power, but hits it square for four one bounce. Next one he slices over the off side, lands in a gap, thought they had time for two but David doesn’t risk it, accepts one run from the fifth ball. Ellis with a free swing, aims for six over square leg, caught in the deep… but it’s a no ball! So, free hit, but they didn’t run. Had they taken one, David would have had the free hit. They should have run two on that ball, honestly. That’s basic batting surely, you have to assume that the catch could be dropped. Missed out on two runs there. Ellis slaps the freebie over the bowler’s head, but they would only have got one, so David says no. 17th over: Australia 158-7 (David 78, Ellis 1) Ngidi returns, David punches straight but refuses a run. Digs out a yorker and calls for two, with nobody anywhere near the circle on the leg side. Sharp call. Rabada slips trying to pick the ball up running in, any rate. David follows it up with six! Straight drive, just to the off side, gorgeous timing. Flat and long. Drags the following ball and refuses the run, fourth ball. Keeps out the yorker from the fifth. Takes the run to end the over. Ellis has still only faced the one ball when he first came in. Three overs to go. Still time for a David ton if he can connect as desired. 16th over: Australia 149-7 (David 69, Ellis 1) Muthusamy to bowl his last. David turns down a single from the first two balls, he’s going to launch… and he does! And dropped at long on! That went miles in the air, way up, and Stubbs underneath it has too much time to think. Has to lurch back at the last minute, off balance, shells it just inside the rope. So David puts them on the roof! Next ball, just short enough from Muthusamy, and he belts it flat onto the tall stadium roof here in Darwin. Didn’t run while the catch was being dropped. Kept strike, used it, and uses it again, as Muthusamy goes full, getting cleaned out by David’s drive over wide long on. Another huge hit. Stubbs hides his head behind his arm. David takes a run to keep the strike. He’s 69 from 39. 15th over: Australia 136-7 (David 56, Ellis 1) Nasty short one from Maphaka, Ellis rides the bounce down to deep third, would have been a slip catch if they’d had the fielder in. David finds a run to keep the strike. Five overs to go. When does David launch? Rotates the strike first ball does Dwarshuis, little bottom edge past his leg stump, David sharp and racing through to beat the keeper Rickelton in a foot race. Thumps the cut shot, but this time Pretorius does decide to do some fielding. He’s not a svelte figure there in the deep, slow across the ground. But when Dwarshuis tries to clear mid off, he scuffs the catch to mid off. 14th over: Australia 132-6 (David 54, Dwarshuis 16) Rabada is back, Dwarshuis does the job with a first-ball single, an edge poke past the keeper. Two runs to cover for David, who then crushes the pull shot along the ground but it’s straight to the deep fielder. Dwarshuis can’t beat point on his first attempt, but does so after a wide, nicely placed behind that position and running away for four. Less ideal that he keeps the strike with a dinked pull shot down the ground. 13th over: Australia 122-6 (David 51, Dwarshuis 10) Ellis, Zampa, Hazlewood, not much batting to come. It’s a weak bottom four by Australian standards. Corbin Bosch trades a few singles, but David finds the six ball eventually, short and not nailed, high on the bat, but still gets the distance to the fence, where a young bloke with a moustache, holding two cans of beer in his right hand, takes the catch casually in the left. David drives two runs past the bowler, then smokes four through cover, and raises his fifty. What a knock in the circumstances. He’s the Solo Man at the moment, bring him a kayak. 12th over: Australia 108-6 (David 38, Dwarshuis 9) “That’s the power of David!” yells the TV, channelling the Book of Samuel. Big Tim hits the shot that Maxwell was trying, sending Muthusamy miles over deep cover onto a nearby roof. Monster hit. The spinner keeps him quiet afterwards though, a couple of singles. Nine from that over, but 1 for 11 from three overs is still a fine night in this format. 11th over: Australia 99-6 (David 30, Dwarshuis 8) “Come on George, just give us your best here, George,” is very wholesome wicketkeeper chat as Linde comes back on. Dwarshuis gets off strike second ball. David gets rid of the helmet, goes bareheaded in the Darwin humidity. Hair shining with moisture. But doesn’t get anything to belt. Can only stab a run off his pads, Linde teasing away at the leg stump. Drops too short to Dwarshuis though who’s able to club a pull for four. What’s going on with Pretorius though? He’s out at deep mid and just trots to pick it up, didn’t make any effort to stop that. “Andre, move!” is the less friendly call from the keeper. Linde is pissed, but follows up with some trash bowling, five wides down the leg side. 10th over: Australia 88-6 (David 29, Dwarshuis 3) And somehow, in this helter-skelter match, Muthusamy bowls an over conceding one run. Dwarshuis soaks up most of it, David can’t keep strike at the end. 9th over: Australia 87-6 (David 29, Dwarshuis 2) Maphaka continues, glided away by Dwarshuis for one. David turns down a single, interestingly. Justifies that next ball when he nails a flat pull shot for six! Barely got off the ground, that one, incredible power over midwicket. Then drives four through the covers with another heavy hit. 8th over: Australia 76-6 (David 19, Dwarshuis 1) Ben Dwarshuis at the crease in the 8th over? Huh. A lot of work for Tim David to do from here. Maxwell all over the shop against Muthusamy’s left-arm spin. Tries to reverse a ball that is angled towards the leg side and pitching outside leg stump, there’s no way to drag that line to the off side. Tries leaving one in a similar arc, thinking it’s wide, but it hits the back of his boot. Then gets width and drills the lofted square drive, but Linde runs around in the deep and dives to take the catch firmly enough to keep it from jarring out as his elbows hit the ground. Good get. 7th over: Australia 75-5 (David 19, Maxwell 1) Glenn Maxwell to the crease, batting seven, in the seventh over. Steers the pace away for one. David can’t get anything off the last ball, after a wide. Maphaka comes on with the fielding restrictions expired. Left-armer, 19 years old, he falls away in his bowling stride and really yanks his shoulder through the action to give the ball energy. After three balls and a couple of singles, that energy produces the pace to go through Owen, backing away and trying to flay through the off side, but playing off his stumps as a right-hander facing a left-armer, and it knocks out off stump. Fierce bowling! 6th over: Australia 71-4 (David 18, Owen 1) Mitch Owen in, another destructive player, who mistimes another slower ball but isn’t trying to mash it, so he gets a run down the ground. Four wickets and 71 runs in the Powerplay. My word. Green keeps going. Plays the shot that got Marsh out, but connects so cleanly it goes 20 rows back, off the hip over deep backward. Ngidi pitches up next, so Green smacks four over long off. He’s 35 off 10 balls. Ngidi takes a deep breath, quietens Green down with a slower ball before a perfect yorker, and after those two dots he goes the slower ball again at 114 kph. Big drive by Green, miscues it because of the pace, and it goes off the toe of bat that was already through the shot, and therefore straight up, and the keeper runs around into the off side to claim it. 5th over: Australia 60-3 (Green 25, David 18) So the run rate’s up and the wickets are falling. David doesn’t mind the latter, he maintains the former, thrashing Corbin Bosch’s first ball over backward point for four. It was full and wide but David has the reach to fetch what Travis Head couldn’t earlier. Bosch, tall and blond and built, looks annoyed, bowls the next into leg stump, and has David hitting to his outfielder at deep backward. That’s more the plan. No plan is containing Green though, who makes it look so easy slotting another six over long on. He’s 24 off 7 balls! Then races a single. He’s six foot seventy-three but he’s also quick enough. One ball to come, and David drives it over cover for six! Oh boy. Three down and they’re going at 12 an over. The ground DJ is playing Chappell Roan. Hot to Go. 4th over: Australia 42-3 (Green 18, David 7) Tim David gets going just like Green. Blocks his first ball from Rabada, but skips down and belts his second off a length for six! Ball angled in at leg stump but he made enough room to swing through and middle it. Drags a single to mid on. Rabada bowls a fat full toss but Green misses it down the leg side. Gets another chance with a wide, and he whacks the replacement delivery off the pads for four through midwicket. Rabada strikes again! Gets the other senior opener too. On the hip, Marsh tries to lift a pull shot up and over deep backward. He gets it up, way up, but not over, and Maphaka does a good job in the deep to hold onto the ball coming down with snow on it. 3rd over: Australia 15-2 (Marsh 13, Green 14) No such worries for Cameron Green! Walks in and and ruins Linde’s over immediately. First ball is cracked to the point fielder, so the second ball he corrects and places a similar shot for four. Picks up the next over long on for four, then cleans out the following one for an even bigger hit in the same direction, six. Easy for Green, he’s 14 off 4! Golden duck! Early spin for South Africa, if you can call it that, but George Linde gets the slightest bit of purchase with his left-arm ortho dart from around the wicket. Stops in the pitch, perhaps, it’s tight on the line of off stump, Inglis leans away and thrashes an aerial cut, and Muthusamy is jumping and off balance at backward point but holds the catch. 2nd over: Australia 15-1 (Marsh 12) Kagiso Rabada to be the other opening bowler, bowls short on the hip and Marsh belts it aerially behind square leg, but it’s slapped down by Ngidi in the deep after it bounces, saving the boundary. One run, then Rabada uses the angle across Head to hide the ball just out of his range, right on the wide line, and Head leaning back has two huge carves and misses both. Tighter line, cracks the cut, but straight to the fielder in the ring. Then again! Almost carries, that one… oh, it did. Flat low cut shot into his hands at ankle height. But straight away, the last ball of the over, Rabada gets his man. Full, wide outside off, squeezed out by Head reaching for it, and Maphaka at backward point lets the ball bobble off his hands into his stomach, then holds it. What a great over. 1st over: Australia 14-0 (Marsh 11, Head 2) Starts with a bang! Not a convincing bang, Marsh gets that straight drive low on the bat, near the toe, but still has enough power in his huge shoulders to get it over long off for six. It hung in the air like wet laundry but plopped down in a pile on the good side of the rope. Lungi Ngidi follows up with a horrible leg side wide, way down and nearly beats the keeper swinging away, then short width that Marsh crunches over cover for four. Ngidi eventually gets things right, with an in-ducker to cramp Marsh, then the right line to make Marsh and then Head hit to Ngidi’s boundary rider at deep backward point. Interesting new configuration for Australia, Marsh and Head at the top of the order. Both have had some big returns opening for Australia in one-day cricket in the past couple of years, especially the T20 World Cup, so after some recent experimenting, Australia are going for the tested senior players in the run-up to the next T20 global tournament early next year. On a pitch you don’t know, chase. That’s the wisdom.

This is a funny sequel to the World Test Championship final that South Africa won. And it’s a funny time to be playing in Australia, in early August. But that’s what we’re doing: Australia v South Africa winter cricket in Darwin, a T20 series, in the tropical north. Let’s slice a pineapple.
