  A quiet transformation is unfolding in schools: commercial technology is
  rapidly reshaping how children learn, often without much public debate or
  inquiry. From the near-ubiquity of Google and Microsoft to speculative AI
  products such as Century Tech, big and ed tech alike promise “personalised
  learning” while harvesting vast amounts of data and turning education to
  monetisable widgets and digital badges. The so-called digitalisation of
  education is far less revolutionary in reality. Children sit at screens making
  PowerPoint slides or clicking through apps such as Dr Frost or Quizlet.
  Lessons are often punctuated by pop-up adverts and cookie-consent banners –
  the gateway to surveillance and profiling. Others chase Duolingo streaks,
  supposedly learning French, scramble coins or fight for leaderboard spots on
  Blooket. Teachers, meanwhile, are handed dashboards from platforms such as
  Arbor or NetSupport, where pupils appear as scores and traffic-light charts –
  a thin proxy for the complexity of classroom life. All the while, these
  systems are entangled in corporate turf wars and profit-making. Across this
  work, I’ve seen echoes of the same tactics once used by big tobacco (on
  health): manufacture doubt to delay regulation and market uncertainty as
  progress. Parents often feel a quiet unease watching their children absorbed
  by screens, yet worry that pushing back might leave them behind. That
  self-doubt is no accident. It mirrors the marketing logic that kept people
  smoking for decades – big tobacco sowed doubt and turned public concern into
  private guilt by funding skewed research insisting that there is “not enough
  evidence” of harm, shifting responsibility on to individuals and pouring vast
  sums into lobbying to delay regulation. As these systems scale and cheapen,
  however, a troubling divide is emerging: mass, app-based instruction for the
  many, and human tutoring and intellectual exchange reserved for the elite.
  What is sold as the “democratisation” of education may be entrenching further
  inequality. Take Photomath, with more 300m downloads: snap a photo of an
  equation and it spits out a solution. Convenient, yes; no need for a tutor,
  perhaps – but it reduces maths to copying steps and strips away the dialogue
  and feedback that help deepen understanding. Amid this digital acceleration,
  parents’ unease is not misplaced. The industry sells these tools as progress –
  personalised, engaging, efficient – but the reality is more troubling. The
  apps are designed to extract data with every click and deploy nudges to
  maximise screen time: Times Tables Rockstars doles out coins for correct
  answers; ClassDojo awards points for compliant behaviour; Kahoot! keeps
  students absorbed through countdown clocks and leaderboards. These are
  different veneers of the same psychological lever that keeps children
  scrolling social media late at night. Even if such tools raise test scores,
  the question remains: at what cost to the relationships in the classroom or to
  child development and wellbeing? And here the gap between promise and reality
  becomes clear: for all the talk of equity and personalisation, the evidence
  base for ed tech is narrow, industry-driven and shaky at best. There’s little
  record of the time children spend on school devices, what platforms they use,
  or the impact these have on learning – let alone on wellbeing and development.
  One study found that to achieve the equivalent of a single GCSE grade
  increase, pupils would need to spend hundreds of hours on one maths app in a
  year – with no evidence this closed attainment gaps for the least advantaged.
  The absence of definitive evidence is spun as proof of safety while digital
  promises are built on the appearance of certainty where none exists.
  Meanwhile, UK public funding continues to support classroom digitisation, with
  calls for AI even in early years settings. Schools in England feel pressured
  to demonstrate innovation even without strong evidence it improves learning. A
  study published this year by the National Education Union found that
  standardised curricula often delivered via commercial platforms – are now
  widespread. Yet many teachers say these systems reduce their professional
  autonomy, offer no real workload relief and leave them excluded from
  curriculum decisions. Moreover, all this is wrapped in the language of
  children’s “digital rights”. But rights are meaningless without corresponding
  obligations – especially from those with power. Writing privacy policies to
  meet data privacy laws isn’t enough. Ed tech companies must be subject to
  enforceable obligations – regular audits, public reporting and independent
  oversight – to ensure their tools support children’s learning, a demand widely
  echoed across the education sector. It’s time to ask tougher questions. Why
  are apps rooted in gamification and behaviour design – techniques developed to
  maximise screen time – now standard in classrooms? Why is a child’s future now
  assumed to be digital by default? These are not fringe concerns. They cut to
  the heart of what education is for. Learning is not a commercial transaction.
  Childhood is not a market opportunity. As educational theorist Gert Biesta
  reminds us, education serves not only for qualifications and socialisation,
  but also to support children in becoming autonomous, responsible subjects.
  That last aim – subjectification – is precisely what gets lost when learning
  is reduced to gamified clicks and algorithmic nudges. We can’t stop technology
  from entering children’s lives, but we can demand that it serves education,
  not industry. My message to parents is this: alongside teachers, your voices
  are crucial in holding tech companies to account for what they build, how they
  sell it and the values they embed in classrooms. Dr Velislava Hillman is an
  academic, teacher, writer and consultant on educational technology and policy.
