  The gender-critical Irish novelist John Boyne has said he has been brought
  “very close to the edge” by the backlash to his inclusion on the longlist for
  a literary prize for LGBTQ+ authors. Ten authors and two judges withdrew from
  the Polari prize and more than 800 writers and publishing industry workers
  signed a petition calling on Polari to remove Boyne’s novella Earth from its
  longlist. In his first response to the row, Boyne wrote on social media posts
  on X and Bluesky: “I came very close to the edge this week because of endless
  harassment at the hands of both strangers and fellow writers.” Boyne, who is
  best known for his 2006 novel The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, added: “I
  remained silent throughout but there’s been a few moments where I thought it
  would be easier not to go on. There’s really only so much abuse one person can
  take. However, I’m still here. Because I have too many books in me that I
  still want to write.” He urged new writers boycotting the prize to re-enter
  the award, saying they were either misguided or had been bullied or
  intimidated into withdrawing. Boyne, who describes himself as a Terf – the
  acronym for trans-exclusionary radical feminist – said that if the writers did
  re-enter the list, he would ask the judges not to consider Earth for the
  shortlist. Nominated writers boycotting the prize over Boyne’s inclusion
  included the Guardian journalist Jason Okundaye, whose Revolutionary Acts was
  nominated for the first book prize longlist and Andrew McMillan, the author of
  Pity, which was longlisted for the overall Polari prize for a non-debut book.
  Okundaye said he withdrew from the award because Boyne’s inclusion for him did
  not reflect “the stated values and politics” of the Polari prize. Alice
  Oseman, the author of Heartstopper, along with the writers Nikesh Shukla,
  Julia Armfield, Naoise Dolan, Seán Hewitt and Kirsty Logan are among the
  hundreds to have signed the statement against Boyne’s inclusion on the list.
  It said Boyne had “unequivocally associated himself with trans exclusionary
  sentiments” and that his inclusion on the list was “inappropriate and hurtful
  to the wider community of LGBTQ+ readers and writers”. “In any year, the
  decision to include Mr Boyne on the longlist would be, in our view,
  inappropriate and hurtful to the wider community of LGBTQ+ readers and
  writers,” the statement read. “That the decision has been made this year – in
  the context of rising anti-trans hatred and systematic exclusion of trans
  people from public life in the UK and across the world – is inexcusable.” But
  Boyne has received support from prominent gender-critical writers, including
  JK Rowling. Last week, Rowling responded to the authors’ statement against him
  by writing on X: “Oh, fuck off. I hope everyone buys twice as many John Boyne
  books, a) because he’s brilliant, and b) to piss off the Gender Taliban.” In
  response to Boyne’s statement, the writer and former Guardian columnist Julie
  Bindel posted: “I am proud to know you, John. Thank you for your support for
  women, including lesbians, and gay men. And shame on the bullies. You deserve
  to stand proud.” In his statement, Boyne set out his views on trans rights. He
  said: “All human beings should have the same rights, but if the rights of
  trans women come into conflict with the rights of what you call ‘cis’ women,
  then the latter must take precedence.” He said he accepted that the organisers
  of the petition against him may have “meant well”. But he said they had
  “forgotten a crucial fact”. “That the novelist you’re protesting, and the
  novel you tried to exclude, is part of a sequence about sexual abuse from a
  gay man who endured that very trauma at school, was denied justice because my
  abuser died in the months leading up to the trial, and is still coping with
  not getting my day in court.” Boyne said: “It seems absurd and wrong to me
  that so many debut writers are losing their opportunity for this, either
  through misguided ideas about who I am or, as I’m aware has happened in some
  cases, because you too were bullied or intimated into withdrawing.” He added:
  “I would encourage all the debut writers on the Polari longlist to return to
  the list, to look forward to the shortlist announcement and, in time, the fun
  and excitement of the ceremony. One of you gets to win the prize, and that’s
  as it should be. The organisers stood firm and didn’t expel me from the
  longlist, which I appreciated. And I am not withdrawing from the longlist.
  However, should the debut writers all return, I would respectfully ask the
  judges not to consider Earth for the shortlist. I don’t think I can say any
  fairer than that.” • This article was amended on 19 August 2025 to include a
  comment from Jason Okundaye.
