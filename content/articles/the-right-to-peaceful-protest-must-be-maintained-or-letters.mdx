  Andy Beckett is right that “the legally safe space for protest in Britain is
  shrinking again” (Anger, fear and a total rejection of politics: the Palestine
  Action protest was a snapshot of Britain today, 11 August). Yvette Cooper, the
  home secretary, might consider this as she ponders why so many ordinary
  people, not previously political activists, are volunteering for arrest as
  terrorist sympathisers. The proscription of Palestine Action sits among
  egregious violations of international law. People outraged by atrocities in
  Gaza and the West Bank are dismayed at the continued prevarications of our
  government. This is one motivation for those seated terrorists. However, there
  is another – the relentless attack on our civil liberties. This did not begin
  with Keir Starmer’s government, but it has doubled down on suppressing
  freedoms with renewed zeal. When the Terrorism Act (under which Palestine
  Action was proscribed) was debated in 1999, it was acknowledged: “We will have
  handed the terrorists the victory that they seek if … we descend to their
  level and undermine the essential freedoms and rule of law that are the
  bedrock of our democracy.” This was the then home secretary, Jack Straw. He
  reassured the Commons that the bill was “not intended to threaten in any way
  the right to demonstrate peacefully – nor will it do so”. Never would a
  British government misuse the huge power it was being given. More than 700
  arrests for supporting Palestine Action testify to his error. Not-so-ordinary
  people are risking jail sentences, travel restrictions, asset confiscation and
  ruined employment prospects. They are outraged at Gaza, but also outraged to
  see counter-terror legislation pressed into supporting a morally moribund
  government. Dr David Killick Kendal, Cumbria • Andy Beckett’s account of his
  sortie into the recent London demonstration in support of Palestine, and
  reports of the rightwing protest groups gathering outside hotels housing
  asylum seekers, are both indicators that few people now have a sense that Keir
  Starmer’s Britain reflects their views or priorities. As well as in London,
  people here in Derbyshire and other towns around the country gathered to
  express their frustration with our politicians’ response to some of their
  deepest concerns. We have become a country without a shared agreement on what
  constitutes right or wrong, on what is an acceptable form of dissent, or on
  what constitutes the real threats to the survival of our democratic freedoms.
  This government thrashes about desperately trying to make sense of the events
  happening all around it and making ill-judged knee-jerk responses that provoke
  even more hostility. It seems unable to articulate a narrative that will help
  people feel heard, or which can help foster a sense of social cohesion. The UK
  has become a country devoid of spiritual, moral and political leadership. The
  threats from without and within are beginning to fray the very fabric that
  once held everything together. The critical task for this government now is
  how it is going to heal and unite this fractured, divided country before it
  heads into yet further chaos and conflict and everything begins to fall apart.
