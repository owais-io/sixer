  predicts Potter

  Graham Potter has said a weight was lifted off Lucas Paquetá’s shoulders when
  the West Ham midfielder was cleared of spot-fixing after a two-year Football
  Association process. Paquetá was at risk of a lengthy ban after the FA charged
  him last year with four counts of deliberately getting booked to influence
  betting markets so that friends and family members may benefit. The
  investigation came to light in August 2023, ending the Brazilian’s hopes of
  joining Manchester City that month, and had the potential to end the
  27-year-old’s career. Confirmation of a regulatory commission finding the case
  against Paquetá to be not proved arrived last month. The Brazil international,
  who joined West Ham for £51m three years ago, has gone on to perform well in
  pre-season and Potter senses that the former Lyon player’s mood has been
  lifted by no longer being under suspicion. “I think he’s done really well,”
  West Ham’s head coach said. “Admirable in terms of how he dealt with the
  situation. Like any human being there are good days and bad. But he’s managed
  to stay relatively consistent throughout it all. I think there’s a weight
  lifted off him. He’s been fighting for his career, essentially. When that’s
  away, then you get a lighter version.” It is unsurprising that Paquetá’s
  performances dipped after he was charged. He looked unfocused at times and was
  dropped at the end of last season. His talent is not in doubt though, and
  Potter is pleased to have him available. West Ham have no intention of selling
  Paquetá. “We’re delighted to have him,” Potter said. “We’re delighted that
  what’s been hanging over him has been cleared. It’s been an incredible test
  for him and the support he’s had from his family and from his teammates and
  from the club has been incredible. I’m sure he’ll say the same. But for Lucas
  it’s been a tough time. “He’s a player that we understand, we love, his
  quality is incredible. Our challenge is to help him bring that out to the best
  of his ability, to fit with what we’re trying to do. If we can do that he’s a
  massive asset for us.” West Ham, who open with a trip to Sunderland on
  Saturday afternoon, have made four signings and are looking to buy two
  midfielders. They are reluctant to return with an improved offer for
  Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes, whose £60m valuation is deemed unrealistic.
  Potter is not working with a big budget and stressed the need to remain
  compliant with profitability and sustainability regulations but insisted West
  Ham were capable of playing exciting football even if they do not add more
  energy and creativity in midfield.
