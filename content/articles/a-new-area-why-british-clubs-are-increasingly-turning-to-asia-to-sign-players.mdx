  Arsène Wenger was ahead of the curve in 2013 when he identified one of the
  world’s fastest growing talent pools. “I find a new market that is very
  interesting and very competitive is the Japanese market,” he said. “Look at
  the number of Japanese players who play now in Germany for example.” And now
  England. This summer, Japan’s Kota Takai became part of the new Thomas Frank
  era at Tottenham while Birmingham have added another two Japanese players to
  take their contingent to three. They also have the South Korean midfielder
  Paik Seung-ho while his compatriot Park Seung-soo has joined Newcastle from
  Suwon Bluewings. “The idea is that we’re coming into a new area,” the
  Newcastle scout Oliver Slater says. “We’re coming into a new market, which we
  have not really looked too much into before.” Post-Brexit rules have made it
  easier for clubs to sign players directly from Japan and Korea but there is
  also a greater recognition of the talent available in East Asia. Japan were
  not just the first team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, but are no longer
  satisfied with just reaching a tournament with the captain and Liverpool
  midfielder Wataru Endo telling fans that it is time to talk of winning. The
  Japan FA long ago set a target of 2050, but now that seems a little
  unambitious. The talk is of a last-eight place next year, the semis by 2030
  and then to go and win. Given talent such as Kaoru Mitoma of Brighton and the
  fact that Japan’s youth development system is one of the best in the world, it
  would not be a shock. There are five Japanese players in the Premier League
  now that Takehiro Tomiyasu has left Arsenal after injury issues. There are
  nine in the Championship and – apart from the British nations and Ireland –
  only Jamaica, Denmark and Australia have more representatives in the second
  tier. “The Premier League has changed English football and that in turn has
  changed the Championship,” says Eddy Bosnar, who played in Japan and South
  Korea before heading home to Australia where he later became head of
  recruitment at Western Sydney Wanderers. “There is a lot more technical
  football now and it suits Japanese players more as they are excellent in that
  respect and also quick and always ready to listen and learn. In Australia, we
  were ahead of them back in the day, our team was full of players at big
  European clubs from 2000 to 2005 but now Japan are way ahead because of their
  development.” Not only are they good, they are also relatively cheap and
  heading overseas at a younger age. The Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said
  last week in Australia that clubs have to look elsewhere as the European
  market is expensive. As yet, Japan’s is not. Takai, a classy defender called
  “Japan’s Van Dijk” by the national team coach, Hajime Moriyasu, was the most
  expensive Japanese player in J.League history but the international joined
  Spurs for less than £6m. Even if the 20-year-old never plays for Tottenham,
  the club would probably get their money back. “In Japan, they want to give the
  players a chance to go to Europe as it is good for Japanese football in the
  long-term,” Bosnar, who was also at Dinamo Zagreb, says. “They also, like
  clubs in Croatia, wait for the second transfer – players come and then get
  sold and then there is a sell-on clause.” There is a debate in Japan whether
  clubs are undervaluing their talent and, as more players impress, the fees are
  sure to rise. For now, though, there is a desire to be seen to be helping
  youngsters move on and, for obvious reasons, J.League clubs would rather their
  best players join Tottenham or Celtic rather than a domestic rival. Korean
  clubs have historically received better fees for their young talents and while
  league leaders Jeonbuk Motors have, for now, denied their star Jeon Jin-woo a
  move to the Championship when they are in the middle of a title race, there is
  also a desire for their players to head to England. Park Ji-sung was the
  pioneer for many, joining Manchester United in 2005 and ensuring that his
  countrymen and women back home were served a weekly Premier League diet. Park
  made an international name for himself helping the Taeguk Warriors reach the
  last four at the 2002 World Cup, moving to PSV Eindhoven soon after and, after
  a slow start, becoming a star and heading to Old Trafford. “The World Cup
  helped both countries and the football has grown a lot since then,” Bosnar
  says. “As soon as a World Cup comes to a country, then everything changes, and
  it continues to change.” More than two decades on, Korean and Japanese players
  have shown their worth on the pitch. There are still comments about shirts
  being sold in the “Far East” when new signings are made, but these are much
  less common than in the past. Japan, especially, are becoming a force in the
  world of football, and increasingly in England. • On Thursday 11 September,
  join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and a host of your other Football Weekly
  favourites live on stage for an evening of unfiltered football punditry at
  Troxy in London and livestreamed globally. Book tickets here.
