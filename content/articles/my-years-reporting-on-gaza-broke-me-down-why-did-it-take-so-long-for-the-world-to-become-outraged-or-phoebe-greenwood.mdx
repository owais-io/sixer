  When I moved to Jerusalem in 2010, the foreign correspondents there offered me
  some unsettling advice: “The first year here you’ll hate the Israeli
  government, the second year the Palestinian leadership, by the third you’ll
  hate yourself.” It’s best to leave before four, I was told, in the interest of
  sanity. I nodded along thinking how sadly cynical they were. I would do better
  than that, I told myself. I did not. I lasted a little under four years in
  Israel and Palestine. In that time, I reported on forced displacement and
  punitive bureaucracy (Israel’s occupation is expanded through denied permits,
  home demolitions and revoked ID cards). I wrote about child killings, war
  crimes and terrorism (perpetrated by both sides). I tried to explain as best I
  could the annexation of the West Bank and the collective punishment of two
  million people in Gaza without using forbidden phrases such as apartheid or
  war crime. I included the necessary balance of voices and opinions. But still,
  every report of an atrocity in Palestine was met with highly personal
  accusations of bias. Editors were often twitchy, readers disengaged. After two
  years of this, a grim reality became clear: people did not want to hear about
  it. By year three, I had started giving up trying to make them listen and the
  self-loathing arrived. Cynicism among reporters is a useful cipher for the
  fear, desperation and impotence that news industry norms do not allow them,
  but it has a dangerous side-effect: it dulls outrage. Without outrage, crimes
  such as apartheid, ethnic cleansing and genocide can continue uninterrupted –
  and they have. Over a decade later, with Gaza’s annihilation playing in my
  social media feed, I have been finishing my first novel, Vulture, for the past
  two years. It is the story of a reporter, Sara Byrne, trying to make a name
  for herself amid a war in Gaza. She is a destructive character steeped in
  cynicism and self-loathing who emerged, in all her surprising unpleasantness,
  as I tried to resolve my own experience as a journalist covering Palestine.
  There were nagging doubts and questions I could not shift, like: why have
  those of us whose job it was to report the atrocities in Palestine been so
  spectacularly unable to stop them? The action in Vulture is fiction but set
  within the real time frame of the 2012 war in Gaza, which I covered. I was
  visiting Gaza City when the Hamas leader Ahmed al-Jabari was assassinated. I
  arrived at the site of his “liquidation” within an hour, the burned-out frame
  of his car still smouldering. I noticed the blood splatters reaching the
  second floor of surrounding buildings in the writing of my first front page.
  Israel had launched its Operation Pillar of Defence. Wars were never
  surprising in Gaza. Since 2006, when the last general election in Palestine
  paved the way for Hamas to take power and Israel and Egypt to impose their
  blockade, there has been a regular exchange of rockets fired by Hamas and
  bombs dropped by the Israeli military. Every few years, Israeli generals
  declared a military operation to bomb back Hamas infrastructure. Chatting
  comfortably off the record, retired military people called it “mowing the
  grass”. In the 2009 war – 1,400 Palestinians killed, 11,000 homes destroyed,
  white phosphorus shells dropped on markets and hospitals – Israel had not let
  foreign journalists into Gaza. In 2012, they did. Most of us stayed at the Al
  Deira hotel, eating and sleeping next to one another, reporting and filing the
  same stories. Uniformed staff brought us coffees and french fries as
  airstrikes threatened their homes and families. Every day, we visited bombed
  homes and I made notes: smell of cooking gas, kitchen gone little kids playing
  in rubble find a beetle a crying woman tugging at a buried mattress screams We
  watched a steady stream of dead and injured arrive at al-Shifa hospital
  missing limbs and heads, dust-covered children mute and shaking having seen
  their parents killed. Doctors told us of power and drug shortages. I noted
  them: no disposables anaesthetics running out, can’t do surgeries lots of
  women and children with amputated limbs, quite clean, bombs do the job for us
  We went to the funerals of whole families and spoke to mourners who asked us:
  “You see anyone here with a gun?” After 10 days of Israel’s operation – 167
  Palestinians killed, 1,500 targets in Gaza hit, 700 families displaced – a
  truce was declared. The particular camaraderie you form with your Palestinian
  colleagues under airstrikes is severed abruptly when they drop you off at the
  Israeli border; you are thrilled to be driving back to normality, but they are
  unable to. You’ll see them again when the next flare-up in violence brings you
  back. But when the next war came in 2014, I was already home in London, an
  editor on the Guardian foreign desk: 50 days of fighting, 2,104 Palestinians
  killed, 10,000 wounded. News audiences, we heard, were tuning out. The
  fighting ended, and I left the foreign desk to return to reporting. People
  looked at me warily when I brought up Palestine again. Was I a weird zealot?
  Or worse, an activist? I was neither, but outside of activist circles, the
  “political complexity” of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict left little
  appetite for anything other than its most violent escalations or worst
  humanitarian catastrophes. Cynicism, it turns out, is better company than
  outrage. So I stopped talking about what I knew was going on over there – the
  daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, the threat of settler
  terrorism backed by an occupation force, the extraordinary trauma of living a
  day in Gaza – until I sat down to start work on a novel in 2015 and Palestine
  poured out. I was drawn straight back to the Al Deira hotel, reimagined as The
  Beach. I found myself telling this huge, indigestible tragedy in small, messy,
  blackly funny, heartbreaking, angry human stories. It was a relief, describing
  freely the Gaza I knew. By 7 October 2023, I had left the Guardian. I watched
  news of the Hamas terror attack devastated and sickened, then gripped with
  cold dread for what would follow in Gaza. Like anyone who had covered the
  place for any length of time, I had seen what was coming rehearsed for
  decades. Those nagging questions became urgent: had I done everything I could
  to warn this was coming? No. Did that make me complicit? Maybe. Israel has not
  allowed foreign press into Gaza for this war. Our understanding of what is
  happening there comes from the Palestinian journalists living it and they are
  being killed in extraordinary numbers (176, a 10% mortality rate), their
  newsrooms obliterated along with their families and homes. The ones who remain
  are starving. Their reporting is not balanced, it is personal and outraged. A
  year before Israeli forces killed him on 24 March, local journalist Hossam
  Shabat told his 175,000 X followers: “The biggest problem is not Western
  journalists being unable to enter, but the fact that Western media doesn’t
  respect and value Palestinian journalists … No one knows Gaza like we do, and
  no one understands the complexity of the situation like we do. If you care
  about what’s happening in Gaza, you should amplify Palestinian voices.” His
  message stung deeply. It clarified the discomfort I had felt as an unnecessary
  interlocutor between western readers and Gaza’s tragedy, raising more
  questions about my work there. Western journalists reporting from Palestine
  did not stop the atrocities because we believed that was not our job, we were
  there to bear witness. Maintaining our impartiality is crucial if we are to be
  trusted. But were we not also meant to hold power to account? If we had
  condemned the US and Europe-backed power we knew was perpetrating these
  atrocities with the conviction and outrage they deserved, would 60,000 people
  still have been killed in 21 months? As Vulture lands on bookshelves in the
  US, UN experts have confirmed that famine is under way in the Gaza Strip.
  Starving people are being gunned down at food distribution sites. Its
  hospitals have been bombed, doctors and their families killed. The electricity
  has been cut off. Our Palestinian colleagues are being murdered in staggering
  numbers and western journalists say it is not on them to name the genocide.
  Yet fiction writers do. In the interest of balance, the BBC has decided not to
  air its documentary about doctors in Gaza. Until this week, when even Donald
  Trump was forced to acknowledge “real starvation”, a friend working in
  television news told me a new verb had emerged: to Gaza a story, meaning to
  downgrade its editorial importance. Finally, it seems the forbidden words are
  being named – genocide, famine, statehood – and our leaders may act to do
  something about them. But our outrage has come much too late. Why did we wait?
  Our wary silence abetted the tragedy in Gaza. Our cynicism allowed for the
  defining horror of a generation. Vulture by Phoebe Greenwood is out 12 August
