  Park rangers have removed an illegal marijuana cultivation site in
  California’s Sequoia national park spanning approximately 13 acres (5
  hectares). In a press release on Thursday, the National Park Service said that
  it had removed a total of 2,377 full-grown marijuana plants and approximately
  2,000lbs of trash and infrastructure last week by hand and helicopter
  sling-load operations. The site, which was initially detected and raided by
  law enforcement rangers in 2024, also contained a semi-automatic pistol and
  several hazardous chemicals. Among the chemicals included a gallon of
  Methamidophos, a highly toxic insecticide banned in the US since 2009, the NPS
  said. According to the NPS, the site was not rehabilitated until this year due
  to the presence of hazardous chemicals. No arrests have been made and the
  investigation is ongoing. The NPS went on to identify various damages done to
  the site including diversion of the natural flow of water form a nearby creek
  and installation of irrigation lines, construction of several large pits to
  store diverted water from a nearby creek, significant clearing of natural
  vegetation, as well as digging of terraces into the hillsides for marijuana
  planting. Other damages include development of campsites, kitchen areas and
  cultivation sites in a wilderness area, evidence of poaching activity, as well
  as illegally maintained trails covering approximately two miles. The NPS
  pointed to environmental impacts of large marijuana cultivation sites in
  California’s Central Valley, as a single marjuana plant uses six to eight
  gallons of water a day that would otherwise be used for other wildlife and
  vegetation. It also pointed to runoff water from the sites which may be
  tainted by various pesticides used to grow marijuana. Over the last two
  decades, drug trafficking operations have run what the NPS described as
  “large-scale operations” in and around the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national
  parks. Since then, nearly 300,000 plants worth almost $850m have been
  eradicated from the national parks. Despite marijuana being legalized in
  California in 2016, strict production restrictions have led to a thriving
  black market which has caused widespread environmental damage across the state
  in recent years. In Siskiyou county, more than 15,000 acres of illicit
  marijuana sites have resulted in a significant decline in wildlife, as well as
  the unregulated use of pesticides and chemicals. “We’ve gone down there on the
  ground and there’s really no wildlife. You’re lucky to find a lizard,” Rick
  Dean, the community development director for Siskiyou’s environmental health
  division, told the Guardian in an interview last year.
