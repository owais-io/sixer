  An employment tribunal brought by an NHS Fife nurse who objected to sharing a
  changing room with a transgender doctor has concluded its evidence with
  conflicting interpretations of how the supreme court’s landmark ruling on sex
  impacts on the case. Sandie Peggie, who has worked as a nurse for more than 30
  years, contends she was subject to unlawful harassment under the Equality Act
  when she was expected to share a changing room with Dr Beth Upton. After
  closing submissions were heard on Monday and Tuesday in Dundee, the judge
  Sandy Kemp had been expected to begin his deliberations. Instead, the tribunal
  was thrown into chaos after a last-minute application from NHS Fife’s lawyers
  to amend their pleadings. The tribunal began in February and reconvened in
  July to hear further evidence. It has been followed closely across the UK to
  see how April’s supreme court ruling that “woman” and “sex” in the Equality
  Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex should be applied
  in practice. It is likely to be used as a template for other legal actions.
  The application by NHS Fife could delay the outcome for months while Kemp
  considers it, along with any resulting appeals. Peggie’s lawyer said the nurse
  was “in tears” at the prospect of further hearings. The case centres around a
  disputed incident which took place in a changing room at Victoria hospital in
  Kirkcaldy on Christmas Eve 2023, after which Upton made an allegation of
  bullying and harassment, leading to Peggie’s suspension. In July, NHS Fife
  confirmed Peggie had been cleared of the separate gross misconduct allegations
  after an 18-month internal process. Summing up her case on Monday, Peggie’s
  lawyer Naomi Cunningham repeatedly referenced the supreme court case brought
  by the gender critical campaign group For Women Scotland. She told the
  tribunal: “Trans women are men. That reality is enshrined in law.” But Jane
  Russell KC, representing Fife NHS board and Upton, argued that the ruling
  “says that service providers – it doesn’t cover employers – can, but do not
  have to, exclude [trans women from single-sex facilities] by making use of the
  exceptions in schedule 3 of the Equality Act.” She added: “There is no
  authority that says an employer must do this.” Cunningham, who chairs the
  board of trustees for the gender-critical group Sex Matters, told the tribunal
  that excluding Upton was “the inevitable consequence” of the For Women
  Scotland judgment. “Trans-identifying men who possess gender recognition
  certificates (GRCs) are for certain purposes deemed to be women. But without a
  GRC they are both legally and factually simply men,” she said. Upton has no
  GRC and therefore “must be excluded” from women only spaces, Cunningham added.
  She described NHS Fife as being “in the grip of a delusion”, and that the
  board had “taken on gender identity belief as its institutional position”. It
  had then subjected the nurse to a “heresy hunt” when she challenged this.
  Russell said Peggie had faced disciplinary action not because of her
  gender-critical beliefs, but because of the “objectionable and inappropriate”
  way she expressed them. During the Christmas Eve altercation, Russell said
  Peggie had “repeatedly” misgendered Upton and that her reference to convicted
  rapist Isla Bryson was “an outrageously harmful hurtful and damaging slur”.
  “The claimants behaviour in confronting the young doctor in a professional
  setting in such a way and so unpleasantly is behaviour that ought not to be
  served protection of the Equality Act,” Russell argued. As a mark of the
  significance of the case, which has already cost NHS Fife nearly £220,500, a
  number of national groups were granted permission to intervene in the case,
  including Sex Matters and the trans-led advocacy organisation TransLucent.
  Aspects of the case have played out in parallel on social media. Cunningham
  accused the board of seeking to “drive a wedge between [Peggie] and her
  lesbian daughter” after witnesses claimed she was uncomfortable with her
  daughter’s sexuality. Peggie’s daughter, Nicole, then went on social media to
  challenge this, stating that her mother had always been supportive. And on
  Monday Kemp ruled after some legal argument that Upton’s birth name should be
  redacted from published submissions, only for that name to end up trending on
  X later in the day. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has written to
  NHS Fife regarding access to single-sex facilities for staff on several
  occasions since the tribunal began, most recently in August when it directed
  it to complete a equality impact assessment and apply to supreme court ruling
  “without delay”. Tuesday was the conclusion of final submissions, but Kemp
  warned that he would need time to consider NHS Fife’s amendment application
  first so it would be “very difficult to say” when his judgment would be ready
  and that it would not be before November.
