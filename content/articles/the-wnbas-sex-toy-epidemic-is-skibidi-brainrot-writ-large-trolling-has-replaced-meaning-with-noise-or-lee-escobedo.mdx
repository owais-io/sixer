  The first dildo dropped from the sky like a glitch in the matrix. For anyone
  tuned in to the 29 July game between the Atlanta Dream and Golden State
  Valkyries, the initial reaction was disbelief. In a world where feeds are
  increasingly AI-generated and algorithmically tuned for confusion, the
  boundaries between real and unreal have softened into clay. Our senses, once
  reliable, now compete with simulation. What does it mean when dildos become
  airborne at WNBA games? Not once, not twice, but repeatedly? Protest?
  Performance art? Or just another malformed blip in the automated dreamscape we
  scroll through daily? Two men have been arrested thus far in these grotesque
  affronts. One was 18, the other 23, part of Gen Z, the prime consumer of
  debased meme culture. Authorities have not identified suspects in the most
  recent two dildo-throwing incidents. However, Delbert Carver, a 23-year-old
  man, was arrested in connection with the first incident during a WNBA game in
  Atlanta. According to ESPN, Carver may face charges of disorderly conduct,
  public indecency or indecent exposure and criminal trespass. In an affidavit,
  he allegedly admitted that the act was “supposed to be a joke” and intended
  “to go viral”. When dildos become airborne at WNBA games more than once, the
  meaning shifts. It reveals the collapse of coherence under TikTok’s attention
  economy. These aren’t protests or insults that make a point. They’re
  spectacles. The goal is to provoke. In a memetic landscape poisoned by irony,
  absurdity is the point. The dildo isn’t symbolic. Its function is noise.
  Philosopher Guy Debord would be shocked at how on the nose we have become. His
  work argued we live in a “society of the spectacle,” where life is mediated
  through image, and authenticity is replaced by performance. Today, women’s
  sports are doubly mediated, first through the lens of athletic competition,
  then through the social gaze that still questions their legitimacy. Laura
  Mulvey’s theory of the “male gaze” further sharpens this: Women, particularly
  in visual media, are often positioned not as agents but as objects. In this
  context, female athletes are not merely participants in a game. They’re props
  in someone else’s viral moment. The dildo becomes mise-en-scène. The
  memeification of rebellion But this isn’t just theoretical. It’s real. So is
  the disrespect. The dildo is a weaponized farce. It’s thrown not just to
  interrupt but to dominate the narrative, to remind players that their gender,
  their careers and their stage remain vulnerable to mockery. It stops the game.
  Hijacks it, even. And reasserts the notion, violent and comical, that women’s
  achievements exist on borrowed time within a culture still conditioned to
  belittle them. So far, the suspects in these cases are part of Gen Z, a
  generation raised in and by the internet. Their actions cannot be dismissed as
  isolated provocations. They must be contextualized within TikTok’s cultural
  logic, or worse, the absurdist ethos of “Skibidi Toilet”. If you are a
  normally functioning adult with a job, you might ask, “What is Skibidi
  Toilet?” Skibidi Toilet is a viral animated web series featuring surreal,
  low-resolution battles between human heads protruding from toilets and
  humanoid characters with surveillance equipment for heads. Glitchy visuals,
  overstimulating pacing, and meme loops create a vibe without meaning. But to
  understand these trolls’ intentions, and see the direction society is headed,
  we must contextualize them within TikTok’s cultural logic. The garish green
  dildo mirrors the surreal, low-fi, uncanny aesthetic of Skibidi Toilet or any
  number of algorithm-fueled meme cycles. The dildo is an anti-symbol. Its
  meaning is its absurdity. Skibidi brainrot encapsulates a generation fluent in
  irony but starved for meaning. The dildo is funny not because it says
  something, but because it says nothing. It’s the irrational object breaking
  into a space of rationality. This kind of hyper-chaotic media serves as both
  entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online. Their
  minds normalize prank-as-expression. In this context, throwing a dildo on to
  the court during a WNBA game isn’t just an act of crude rebellion. It sadly
  mirrors the Skibidi Toilet ethos: low-effort disruption cloaked in irony,
  where the gesture is meant to be meaningless and provocative at once. As
  traditional signifiers of rebellion (punk, political protest, counterculture)
  fade or fragment in the digital noise, young men are absorbing frameworks of
  meaninglessness, where “funny = power” and shock is its own reward. Furthering
  the chronically online element of all this, in the last two days, a crypto
  memecoin group has claimed credit for the recent dildo-throwing incidents at
  WNBA games, reframing what seemed like rogue trolling as a deliberate
  guerrilla marketing stunt. The group, which openly mocks the league and brags
  about not watching women’s sports, celebrated the act online as a victory. If
  true, this spectacle is engineered by people who understand that visibility
  matters more than meaning in an algorithm-driven culture. This is how meme
  culture is rotting America: not from the inside, but from online. The
  internet’s lack of regulation is its greatest strength and its most dangerous
  flaw. It allows once-fringe ideologies and juvenile impulses to scale without
  resistance. Ideas that would have died in solitude or been challenged in a
  public square now find shelter in forums and meme loops, rewarded by
  engagement. In this new economy of attention, even humiliation has utility.
  We’re left with a culture where trolling becomes its own form of marketing.
  From trolls to Trump: the end of shame How did we arrive at this level of
  collective debasement? Despite living in an era of unprecedented digital
  access, over half of American adults (54%) read below a sixth-grade level, and
  21% are considered illiterate as of 2022. This foundational deficit in
  literacy undermines a person’s ability to evaluate online messages critically.
  Thus, a generation raised on irony struggles to decode satire, or even
  manipulation. Back in 2013, 66% of fourth graders couldn’t read proficiently.
  It was a warning sign that today’s adults would fail to distinguish viral
  provocation from genuine meaning. Online, many young people now build identity
  from meme fragments, unconsciously mimicking behavior they don’t fully
  understand. Lacking media literacy, they become perfect vessels for cultural
  incoherence. All of this really boils down to the death of shame within
  society. And it starts at the top. Donald Trump’s most enduring legacy isn’t a
  policy but a persona as the shameless troll who made humiliation a political
  strategy. His constant provocation and gleeful disdain for norms created a
  playbook both parties use now. Liberals respond with faux-moral outrage,
  conservatives with Nietzschean bravado, but the end result is the same: a
  culture addicted to performance, where shame is no longer a deterrent. This
  logic has trickled down into every corner of public life through race, class,
  gender and especially online culture, where symbolic acts of ressentiment
  become viral currency. The dildo thrown at a women’s basketball game isn’t
  just a crude joke but a memeified act of humiliation. It doesn’t challenge
  power on any level, it just wants attention. And in a culture without shame,
  the humiliation sticks to the target, not the perpetrator. In this case, the
  WNBA players themselves. The fact that these incidents have popped up
  simultaneously across the country, from New York to Atlanta to Chicago, shows
  that the lack of shame is collective, bipartisan and here to stay. This is
  where we are: everything is bait. We’ve collapsed the distinction between
  trolling and activism, and so we land – like the dildo itself – on the bottom
  of the floor, laughing, recording, retweeting, but never asking what it says
  about who we’ve become.
