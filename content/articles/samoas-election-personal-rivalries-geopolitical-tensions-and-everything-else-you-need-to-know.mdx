  Samoa will go to the polls on Friday in a national election called early by
  the caretaker prime minister, Fiamē Naomi Mata’afa, after months of political
  turmoil. Official campaigning ceased on Sunday with billboards blacked out,
  posters taken down and social media endorsements suspended under strict orders
  from the electoral commissioner. The vote is tipped as unpredictable, with
  three main contenders vying for leadership. While most Samoans are focused on
  cost-of-living pressures, the result will also shape the country’s approach to
  China, Australia and the US in a region marked by intensifying geopolitical
  rivalry. Why was the election called? The Pacific country of about 219,000
  people is hoping to usher in a new era of stability after a turbulent
  political chapter. Fiamē survived two no-confidence motions in the span of two
  weeks in February and March, but was forced to call the election in May when
  her minority government was unable to pass its national budget. Her opponents
  in parliament accused her of being unfit for office. Her leadership also came
  under pressure in April when widespread blackouts prompted a state of
  emergency and intensified scrutiny of Fiamē’s leadership. The outages hit an
  economy already strained by inflation. Fiamē’s term got off to a rocky start
  in 2021 after a knife-edge election result led to legal challenges and
  constitutional manoeuvring that left the country without a functioning
  government for 45 days. The country’s first female prime minister was sworn in
  under a marquee outside parliament after being locked out of the chamber.
  “Nobody wants the repetition of what happened in 2021,” broadcaster Tui Eddie
  Taualapini said. “People just want a government to be established quickly and
  bring in the budget.” Who are the frontrunners? A total of 187 candidates,
  including 46 independents, are running across six parties for 50 seats. Anna
  Powles, associate professor at Massey University, said the contest was
  “shaping up to be unpredictable, with a cast of old and new politicians and
  parties”. She said the race was centred on three frontrunners for the top job:
  Fiamē, now leading the Samoa Uniting party (Sup), after breaking away from
  Faatuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (Fast). Tuila’epa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi, the
  81-year-old leader of the Human Rights Protection party (HRPP) and
  long-serving former prime minister. La’aulialemalietoa Leuatea Polata’ivao
  Schmidt, former agriculture minister, now leader of Fast after a split with
  Fiamē. The campaign has been coloured by personal rivalries. Fiamē expelled
  La’aulialemalietoa from cabinet in 2023 after he was charged with offences
  including harassment and attempting to pervert the course of justice, which he
  denies. When he refused to resign, she dismissed him – only to be ousted
  herself from Fast, which installed him as leader. She responded by founding
  Sup and launching legal action accusing him of spreading conspiracy theories
  during the campaign. What have they promised? All three frontrunners are
  focused on cost-of-living relief. Fiamē has pledged to remove tariffs on
  staple foods and expand free healthcare and education. Tuila’epa has promised
  one-off 500 tala (US$182) payments to all Samoans. He has also pledged to
  construct a bridge between the two main islands – separated by 23km of water –
  which has been criticised by opponents as unrealistic. La’aulialemalietoa has
  offered monthly allowances for pregnant women and extra support for low-income
  families. What does it mean for Samoa - and the Pacific? “These elections are
  very much driven by domestic issues,” Powles said. For most voters, domestic
  issues dominate – especially restoring political stability and addressing
  inflation. According to the Samoa Bureau of Statistics consumer prices are up
  almost 30% from 2022. “Cost of living is the most important issue to local
  people now,” Taualapini said. “Everybody’s promising to fix it … but people
  are waiting to see who will actually deliver.” But the next government will
  also shape Samoa’s foreign policy at a time of intensifying competition
  between China and Samoa’s western partners. Samoa signed a strategic
  partnership with Beijing in 2022, which included a fingerprint laboratory and
  police training centre in Apia. Debt repayments to China are 2.6% of GDP – the
  fourth-highest rate in the world, according to Lowy Institute analysis. Fiamē
  has sought to balance ties with China and western allies. After taking office
  in 2021, she scrapped a proposed $100m China-backed port at Vaiusu Bay,
  calling it excessive for a small island country already heavily indebted to
  Beijing. She told Reuters at the time that Samoa’s debt to China was “a
  pressing issue for voters”, while stressing she wanted constructive relations
  with both Beijing and Washington. Tuila’epa, by contrast, fostered close ties
  with China during his two decades in power, backing the Vaiusu port as a way
  to boost jobs and trade. His return could signal a renewed openness to
  Chinese-backed infrastructure. The election also comes just weeks before the
  Pacific Islands Forum summit in Honiara, where leaders are expected to grapple
  with issues ranging from climate change to regional security. Regardless of
  who wins the election, Samoa is expected to maintain a pragmatic stance.
  “Samoa’s leaders from Tuia’epa to Fiame have been adept at leveraging
  bilateral partners in support of Samoan development priorities and national
  interest,” Powles said.
