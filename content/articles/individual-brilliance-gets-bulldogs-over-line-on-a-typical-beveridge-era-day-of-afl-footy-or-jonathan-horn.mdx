  With 10 minutes to go until the opening bounce of the Bulldogs’ game against
  Melbourne, Luke Beveridge stalked the MCG boundary line, a man careful not to
  slip on a banana peel. He was more clenched and coiled than usual. He looked
  as if he’d spent the last six months deadlifting trucks and moving magnets. He
  knew better than anyone how dangerous this game was. He’d seen Brisbane slip
  up the previous day. He’d seen Fremantle nearly throw away their season. He
  knew his own team’s history of self-sabotaging in games like this. When Aaron
  Naughton kicked his fourth goal and his second in as many minutes in the third
  term, his coach was entitled to loosen up a little. The first half had been a
  dozy affair, with both sides just trundling along. But now Naughton was
  marking everything, Bailey Dale and Marcus Bontempelli had about a thousand
  touches between them and the Dogs had their foot on the throat. But there were
  little distress signals that all was not well. Their deficiencies are glaring.
  They’re a poor intercepting team and struggle to score from turnovers. Their
  defensive zone is often sloppy. It only takes a couple of players to be a
  couple of metres out of place in the grid and the opposition can go to town on
  it. For about half an hour, every time the ball was in the air in their
  backline, they looked like conceding a mark, a free kick and a goal. Besides,
  the Demons are far from the worst team in the world. They annihilated West
  Coast a week ago and it’s worth remembering how well they were playing against
  St Kilda until Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera went berserk. They had a locum coach,
  but they had nothing to lose, and they were suddenly playing like it. Ten
  points down at the final break, the Bulldogs were forced to go as deep down
  the well as they have in a long time. This was a crackerjack contest, a most
  welcome heartstopper after weeks of blowouts. Both sides were superb, but some
  individual brilliance dragged the Dogs across the line. It was Naughton, who
  booted five goals for the fifth time in six weeks. It was Joel Freijah, whose
  clever handballs and tap-ons directly set up three goals. It was Ed Richards,
  whose two goals both had a high degree of difficulty, and both helped his team
  regain the lead. And with all chips on the table, and just a few seconds left
  on the clock, it was Sam Darcy who hurled himself into oncoming traffic and
  pulled down the match saving mark. There’s no wasted energy with Darcy. He
  doesn’t get mad at himself. He doesn’t bother with much push and shove. He
  misses a goal and just trots back to defend. Even when he did his knee, he
  didn’t seem very distraught. But with his team’s season on the line, he
  summoned the urgency and the hide that the moment called for. All up, it was a
  typical Beveridge-era day at the football. They’re one of the most potent
  teams we’ve seen in recent years. They’re a terrific team to watch. They have
  half a dozen of the best and most exciting players in the league. They have
  been competitive in every game they’ve played this year. They have a
  percentage of 135. And they still probably won’t make the eight. While all
  this was going on, one of the biggest upsets in decades was brewing in Perth,
  where the cellar-dwelling Eagles threatened but ultimately failed to roll the
  top team Adelaide. Heading into this weekend, the last time a bottom nine team
  had knocked off a finals contender was five weeks ago when Sydney beat
  Fremantle at the SCG. The Swans went in as favourites that day anyway. And
  they’re the last team you’d want to be playing right now, with a depth of
  talent that belies their ladder position. On the weekend, they finally had a
  full list to choose from, a score to settle and a platform to launch their
  2026 campaign. And they had Isaac Heeney, who even when he’s green-gilled
  still looks as if he should be playing in a bow tie. The Lions were wasteful,
  caught on the hop by Sydney’s slingshot game and suddenly in danger of missing
  the double chance. But Chris Fagan has an optimism that’s at odds with his
  careworn expression. “I don’t doubt this group in any way, shape or form,” he
  said. It’s the sort of thing Ken Hinkley has been saying for more than a
  decade. It has been a lean year for Port Adelaide, but they’re still one of
  those teams that can spring a major surprise every couple of months. With
  Hinkley and Travis Boak bowing out and Zak Butters scampering out the front of
  stoppages, they looked poised to sink Fremantle’s season. The Dockers had
  never beaten them at the Adelaide Oval and were playing dreadfully. But
  Fremantle are dogged, well-conditioned and finally reliable in close finishes.
  The cartoon villainy of Patrick Voss and the exquisite skills of Murphy Reid
  were pivotal in the final term. And with scores level, the music stopping and
  the chair being hoiked from underneath them, captain Alex Pearce drifted
  forward. He resembles Reno Raines from the 90s late night TV show Renegade and
  he sometimes kicks like him. But the set play and the set shot were perfectly
  executed and the Dockers dodged another bullet. That final round game against
  the Bulldogs is going to be excruciating.
