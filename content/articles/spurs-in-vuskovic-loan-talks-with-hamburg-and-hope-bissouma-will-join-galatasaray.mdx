  Tottenham have made progress in talks over the loan of Luka Vuskovic to
  Hamburg, with the expectation being that a season-long deal with no options
  will be finalised before Monday’s deadline. The London club are also looking
  to move Yves Bissouma to Galatasaray. The 28-year-old, who is out of contract
  next summer, has dropped to the bottom of the central midfield pecking order,
  having frustrated Thomas Frank with his timekeeping. Vuskovic joined Spurs
  this summer, albeit his move from Hajduk Split was agreed in September 2023,
  and announced his arrival with a goal and an assist in the pre-season win at
  Reading. The 18-year-old centre-half played in the next friendly against
  Wycombe before his minutes dried up; he has been an unused substitute since
  the season began. Hamburg, who won promotion back into the Bundesliga last
  season, have monitored Vuskovic throughout the summer and can see he is behind
  Cristian Romero, Micky Van de Ven and Kevin Danso in Frank’s thinking. The
  manager also has Radu Dragusin, who is fighting back from an ACL rupture
  sustained in late January, and the new signing Kota Takai as options at
  centre-half, not to mention Ben Davies. Takai has not yet featured as he has
  battled a heel injury. Bissouma was a £25m signing from Brighton in 2022 and
  he played the 90 minutes in last season’s Europa League final victory over
  Manchester United. The picture has changed for him under Frank, who dropped
  him from the squad for the European Super Cup against Paris Saint-Germain,
  complaining that “he has been late several times, the latest one too many”.
  Bissouma has not been in the squad for Spurs’ two Premier League matches
  having picked up an injury in training.
