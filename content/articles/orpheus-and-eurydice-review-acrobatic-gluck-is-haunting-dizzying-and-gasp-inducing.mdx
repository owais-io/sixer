  Orpheus and Eurydice review – acrobatic Gluck is haunting, dizzying and
  gasp-inducing

  Following on from their enthralling Southbank Centre Daphnis et Chloé earlier
  this year, Orpheus and Eurydice offers a second chance to experience the work
  of Brisbane-based Circa under the director, choreographer and set designer
  Yaron Lifschitz. With its streamlined dramatic structure and built-in ballets,
  Gluck’s great reformation opera proves fertile ground for the company’s agile
  blend of acrobatics and contemporary dance. The action opens with the dying
  Eurydice tumbling through space. So extreme is Orpheus’s grief, it seems, that
  he has wound up in an asylum, strapped to one of a series of hospital beds
  that, along with a tiny glass house, make up Lifschitz’s minimalist set. The
  acrobats swirl over and under him – every man an Orpheus, every woman a
  Eurydice – recalling the emotional volatility of their relationship and
  Orpheus’s feverish hopes and fears for their future. Throughout this stark yet
  reasoned production we are never entirely sure what is real and what exists
  merely in the protagonist’s head. Are the sombre chorus members disembodied
  hospital orderlies or fellow inmates? The final scene suggests the latter, but
  the director keeps us guessing. Lifschitz is a master of the striking image: a
  human tower that collapses to audible gasps; a staircase of bodies that one of
  the Orpheus figures must ascend. Only the occasional wobble reminds us of the
  extreme athletic demands. Suspended loops enable acrobats to float and fly
  while hinting at hangmen’s nooses or restraints. White institutional walls are
  deftly lit by Alex Berlage in vivid crimsons, greens and minty blues. Libby
  McDonnell’s black, white and red costumes are simplicity itself; Boris
  Bagattini’s sparing video projections include occasional closeups on a
  troubled face and surtitles that cleverly dissolve in trails of mist. Gluck’s
  three-hander opera is condensed here by combining the roles of Eurydice and
  Amor, as if Orpheus has lost the power to differentiate between the two.
  Iestyn Davies is outstanding as the bereaved husband, his tireless
  countertenor rich and even, with memorably light and lyrical top notes.
  Physically he holds little back, at one point balancing on the shoulders of a
  cluster of acrobats. The climax, an affecting account of Che Farò Senza
  Eurydice, finds him abandoned on a bare stage, arms wrapped around his body as
  if in a straitjacket. Samantha Clarke’s soprano rings out bright and frisky as
  Amor before turning lush and sorrowful as Eurydice. Laurence Cummings leads
  the Scottish Chamber Orchestra through a bracing, finely judged account of the
  score, the Scottish Opera Chorus matches his intensity, singing with power and
  discipline. Their unnerving final appearance as the bloodied Orpheus is strung
  up by the heels in his own private Bedlam is one of the production’s most
  haunting images. • At Edinburgh Playhouse until 16 August • All our Edinburgh
