  Sudesh Singh is surrounded by sequined saris that hang on the walls of her
  clothing store. For more than 30 years, Singh has sold clothing in Dandenong’s
  Little India precinct in Melbourne’s south-east. The precinct spills out from
  train station in Dandenong – one of Melbourne’s most culturally diverse
  suburbs. Colourful clothing shops sit alongside sweet stores selling
  confectionery from Kolkata. But as the construction date for a private
  redevelopment of the area looms, Singh and other traders fear they won’t
  survive. They say a planned revitalisation of the area – which will transform
  it into one made up of apartments, shops and offices – risks the preservation
  of the Indian shopping hub that began in the mid-1990s. Traders say business
  is slow and empty windows suggest some shop owners have already left the
  precinct. Others say they will close their doors before the end of the year,
  instead of temporarily relocating, before the first stage of construction
  starts in 2026. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The plan for the renewal
  includes a new Little India precinct. But Singh says traders remain uncertain
  whether rent increases will make them unable to compete with newer businesses
  in the area. Rendered images of the development show “Little India” shops
  lining an open-air laneway. But Singh says the traders have not been given
  assurances they will be able to lease shops in the new Little India.
  “Parliament didn’t make this street. The council didn’t make this street. The
  traders did,” Singh says. “But what have they given to Little India? Or what
  are they promising to give to Little India? Have they given anything in
  writing to Little India traders? No.” Victoria’s minister for development
  Victoria and precincts, Harriet Shing, told state parliament’s budget
  estimates inquiry last month that the new Little India would be a “fantastic
  addition to the heart of Dandenong” and would “reflect and respect the culture
  of the area”. “It will also offer modern and new facilities and improved
  retail spaces for tenants, creating more opportunities for businesses to
  thrive,” she said in a written response to parliament’s public accounts and
  estimates committee. Singh said the private developer, Capital Alliance, was
  contacting traders to commence discussions about the new tenancies planned.
  She said all current traders would be given an opportunity to be part of the
  area’s redevelopment but noted this would be on “commercial terms that reflect
  market values”, due to the landlord being a private developer. Singh is blunt
  in her assessment of what this means for current Little India shop owners:
  “The bottom line is, we can only survive if the rental is reasonable. “It’s no
  longer a precinct, it’s no longer Little India.” “They’re selling it as a
  Little India. But if we look at that, they’ve got hotels, motels and
  accommodation. They want to make it like Bourke Street.” Development Victoria
  informed Singh, who previously ran two shops on Foster Street, she was
  required to vacate one of her stores by the end of November due to the first
  phase of the redevelopment. A short walk along Foster Street, Purabi Das runs
  two clothing shops. She says business has been particularly sluggish since the
  start of the year. She points to the usual pressures on brick-and-mortar
  retail and a rise in home-run businesses for Indian clothing. “From Covid
  times, some people have been doing businesses from home. Every garage, people
  are selling stuff from home,” she says. In 2020, Development Victoria selected
  Capital Alliance to continue a wider revitalisation project for the suburb –
  first promised by the Bracks Labor government in 2006 – that will transform a
  two-hectare area of land opposite the Dandenong train station, which includes
  Little India. An estimated completion date for the new precinct is expected to
  be confirmed within the next year. Last October, the state’s planning minister
  greenlighted the development’s masterplan. The Allan government said the
  development would deliver 470 new homes, alongside commercial and retails
  spaces. The wider Revitalising Central Dandenong project includes $290m of
  state government funding and $1bn fron private investment. Singh wants all
  Little India traders to be given the opportunity to move into the new
  precinct. “They need to be given a fair opportunity. Not an opportunity where
  they can’t survive. That’s the only way,” she says. Ronan Mellan, the acting
  group head of precincts at Development Victoria, said it was developing a
  “brand new Little India precinct in Central Dandenong – offering modern
  facilities and creating more opportunities for businesses to thrive”. “We do
  not comment on confidential tenant-landlord arrangements” he said. The Liberal
  party’s shadow minister for multicultural affairs, Evan Mulholland, accused
  Development Victoria of “riding roughshod over this wonderful diverse
  precinct”. “The Little India precinct plays a significant role within the
  community, including the preservation of culture, it is critical the precinct
  and traders remain supported,” he said. Capital Alliance was contacted for
  comment. • This article was amended on 1 August 2025 to include a statement
  from the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, which was received after
