  The fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative aims to sidestep
  slow-moving UN climate talks by gathering together nations, cities and
  companies that want to rapidly phase out oil, coal and gas. At the coming
  Cop30 summit in Belém, it hopes to gather support so it can launch
  negotiations for a new treaty next year. The group’s founder, Tzeporah Berman,
  explains why the Amazon rainforest and the global south are an ideal
  springboard for the movement. Why will you be campaigning for a fossil fuel
  non-proliferation treaty? We have to change the way people think about oil,
  gas and coal, which are responsible for 86% of the carbon dioxide emissions
  that are trapped in our atmosphere. The world is on track to produce 110% more
  oil, gas and coal by 2030 than we can ever burn if we want to keep global
  warming below 2C [above preindustrial levels]. That’s because the market is
  distorted by trillions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies. And it’s only
  getting worse because every country is trying to artificially keep alive their
  fossil fuel industries, even though they know the damage they cause. At Cop30,
  we will be working to expand the group of countries participating in the
  development of the treaty. What do you say to those who say a
  non-proliferation treaty is unfeasible anytime soon? Change starts that way.
  When we first talked about renewable energy, people literally laughed at us
  because it was so expensive. But we’ve seen a tremendous change in technology
  and in prices so that today we are powering whole countries with renewable
  energy. Every day, we see major breakthroughs. Last year, one in five cars
  sold on the planet was electric. We can change very quickly when we want to.
  Yes, the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty is a big new idea, but at this
  moment in history, with floods, fires and heatwaves sweeping the planet, we
  need big new ideas. What progress have you made since the fossil fuel
  non-proliferation treaty initiative was founded? The push to negotiate a
  treaty is endorsed by more than 4,000 civil society groups including all of
  the world’s major faith, health, women’s and climate organisations. More than
  120 cities have passed motions to support the fossil fuel non-proliferation
  treaty and they are increasingly being joined by subnational governments such
  as California. We also now have 101 Nobel laureates and over 3,000 scientists
  who have endorsed the treaty. This growing movement helps create the political
  space for more countries to join. So far 17 countries are participating in the
  development of the treaty. In addition, 10 countries have been attending
  senior officials meetings as observers and are showing significant interest
  and we hope there will be another string of announcements at and before Belém.
  But what are the prospects of achieving a critical mass? Treaties for
  landmines and chemical weapons started with a core group of just 20 to 30
  countries who wanted ambitious, binding rules. That shifted the social norm so
  it became unacceptable to stockpile those weapons even for many nations who
  were not signatories to those treaties. Today, fossil fuels are our weapons of
  mass destruction. They kill more people on this planet every year than
  anything else. Even before we calculate the toll from climate change, air
  pollution alone kills 8 million people each year. Fossil fuels are the
  greatest threat to human life. We expect to have enough countries next year to
  begin negotiations. Before and during Cop30 we will be hosting major meetings
  of senior officials and ministers mapping the pathway toward negotiations,
  including the key convenings and conferences that need to be held in that
  process in the months ahead and we hope there will be a significant
  announcement on progress at Belém, so look out. This goes beyond the
  traditional left-right divide, doesn’t it? For me, this all started with the
  conversations I had in Canada with the oil industry over the tar sands in
  Alberta. The Trudeau government back then would say: “We know we need to
  reduce emissions and the world is going to get off fossil fuels but our oil is
  ethical,” even though the tar sands produce some of the heaviest carbon in the
  world. I later realised that whether you’re in Norway or Ecuador or Argentina,
  it’s the same conversation. Every company wants to produce the last barrel
  sold. So every year we miss our emissions reduction targets and every year we
  drill for more oil, we frack for more gas and we dig up more coal. And then we
  wonder why the system isn’t changing, even though renewable energy is cheaper.
  As long as there is no supply side climate policy, then we are trying to cut
  with one half of the scissors by solely focusing on reducing demand. This is
  true even with supposedly progressive climate leaders in office, such as
  Trudeau in Canada, Biden in the US or Starmer in Britain. The system has been
  designed in such a way that, domestically, elected officials don’t feel
  responsible for constraining production. That means we are continuing to put
  our intellectual, financial and political capital towards expanding a system
  that we say we’re phasing out. And it is almost always the case that what we
  build today will be what we use tomorrow. Why do you think the Brazilian
  climate summit is the place to expand this dialogue? Indigenous nations in the
  heart of the Amazon campaigned to keep fossil fuels in the ground long before
  anywhere in the global north. It has now spread across the world from Standing
  Rock and the tar sands in the US to anti-coal campaigns in Australia and
  Europe. In the run-up to Belém, we’ve been working with indigenous nations and
  associations across the region to promote the idea of a fossil-free Amazon
  zone so it can be a model for other parts of the world. We have tremendous
  support from civil society and significant backing from countries. Colombia
  was the first to endorse a fossil-free Amazon – a commitment to no oil and gas
  exploration and extraction in the region – and a global fossil fuel treaty,
  and it is doing diplomatic outreach to other countries. How do you tackle
  climate justice issues? For the last several years, we’ve been commissioning
  studies looking at how to apply equity and finance principles to a negotiation
  on fossil fuel production: who gets to produce and for how long? This takes in
  historical responsibility, just transition, social justice and levels of
  fossil fuel dependency. Brazil – the biggest nation in the Amazon region – has
  just sold more than 100 oil and gas exploration blocks, including some
  offshore from the rainforest. How do you make it worthwhile for countries such
  as Brazil and leaders such as Lula to give up on fossil fuels? At this moment
  in history, leadership is important. What Gustavo Petro, the president of
  Colombia, said when he joined the fossil fuel treaty was that the science is
  clear: no new fossil fuel expansion fits in a world where we meet our climate
  targets. The International Energy Agency has said the same and so has the UN
  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The international court of justice
  has now suggested that is not only a scientific finding but a legal
  obligation. It’s absurd that there’s this constant drumbeat of pledges and
  speeches to protect the Amazon, to support Lula and other leaders in the
  Amazon while, at the same time, financing new oil drilling in the heart of the
  rainforest, in the mouth of the river, and then buying that oil. We need
  responsibility along the entire chain and we need more than press releases and
  empty pledges. We need support for Lula and other leaders to move forward with
  protecting the Amazon and stopping drilling. How do you make it worthwhile for
  countries such as Brazil to give up on drilling particular fields? We’ve
  formed a finance working group that has experts predominantly from the global
  south. They’re producing a series of papers on trade agreements, tax
  agreements, debt relief and market access that would provide countries who
  have joined the fossil fuel treaty with financial support and benefits, as
  well as looking at specific just transition funds from the private sector
  available only to countries participating in the development of the fossil
  fuel non-proliferation treaty. A larger question is whether or not fossil fuel
  development in the global south can eliminate poverty. The plans for expansion
  in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa show the fossil fuel industry
  using these regions as a gas station for the global north: Europe and North
  America. They are unlikely to provide significant economic revenue or products
  to the areas that they’re exploiting. There’s a tremendous amount of evidence
  from the last 50 years to show the legacy is more likely to be poisoned
  waterways and expensive spills. This has been the case for countries that have
  had fossil fuel development for decades such as Ecuador or Nigeria. The
  ecological devastation dramatically diminishes local communities’ abilities to
  support themselves. New fossil fuel infrastructure has high costs and leads to
  ongoing dependency whereas renewable energy infrastructure creates
  independence and greater long-term health and economic benefits. But less than
  2% of global finance for renewables was in the global south. It’s great that
  we have seen a commitment from governments in the United Nations Framework
  Convention on Climate Change to triple renewables, but we need those
  commitments to be coupled with commitments to decommission existing fossil
  fuel assets and to ensure money flows into the global south. Won’t the likely
  absence of the US make it difficult to move forward? We don’t expect the US
  and other major producers to join at this point and that’s fine. That means
  the treaty being developed will be strong and built by those committed to
  ambitious action commensurate with the science calling for absolute decline of
  emissions and production. The far right is already on the offensive against
  net zero [emissions targets]. Won’t the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty
  initiative give them an even bigger target? Politicians can talk about the
  benefits and costs of fossil fuels and renewable energy all they want, but the
  real benefit for real people is that the sun doesn’t send you a bill at the
  end of the month. When we build renewable energy infrastructure, that means
  energy is free for life. Make no mistake about it, renewables are not just a
  different way of powering our cars and our homes; they’re about changing power
  in every sense of the word.
