  Scientists recently announced they had found an enormous new stick insect in
  Australia. At 41cm in length and weighing 44g, the main question I heard was:
  “Why didn’t scientists notice something that big before now?” The short answer
  is: it’s a stick. Stick insects spent over 100m years perfecting their cosplay
  as leaves, branches and moss. They are diabolically difficult to spot, even
  with fairly acute human vision. If you disturb a stick insect, its usual
  response is to fall to the ground and lie still. So now you are looking for a
  stick lying on the ground … among all the other sticks. Scientists were
  alerted to the presence of this new insect, Acrophylla alta, by a photo posted
  on iNaturalist, the community science sharing site. Based on that image, they
  spent several nights tramping through a rainforest with headlamps and
  flashlights, hoping for a glimpse of this rare new beast. They eventually
  located and knocked the stick insect off of its perch, which can be 30 metres
  up in the tree canopy, with a long (actual) stick. Phasmids (stick and leaf
  insects) are an incredible example of natural selection at work. As herbivores
  quietly munching leaves, stick insects are a delicious snack for many other
  animals. Evolution shaped the 3,500-plus described species of phasmids into
  stunning examples of camouflage, usually by pretending to be objects that are
  irrelevant to predators: sticks, bark and leaves. They solved the problem of
  hiding in plain sight through a variety of forms most beautiful and wonderful;
  their bodies range from long skinny tubes to wide and flattened leaf shapes.
  Stick insects are grouped into delightful categories with names like broad
  prickly sticks, winged bark huggers, stout crawlers, narrow leaf mimics and
  tree lobsters. The last is a group best described as insects that gave up on
  the whole delicate leaf and twig act to become heavily armoured, spiny tanks –
  determined to make a predator profoundly regret ever trying to eat them. As a
  former keeper of stick and leaf insects in a bug zoo, I can attest to just how
  good these animals are at being invisible. Even when you knew there were
  exactly 10 leaf insects in a cage, finding numbers 9 and 10 always involved a
  long manual search of every single branch and leaf, sometimes requiring
  multiple people. Jungle nymphs (Heteropteryx dilatata) are 17cm lime-green
  spiky monsters that somehow manage to disappear into foliage despite their
  size. Often you only discovered one by getting a painful kick from a spiny
  leg. The recently described Australian stick insect also lives in a rainforest
  tree canopy, so it’s not surprising it remained hidden for so long. Insects
  and their relatives are the animals science knows the least about, despite
  being some of the most abundant organisms on Earth. After almost three
  centuries of taxonomic research, scientists have only described and named
  about 1m insect species; thousands of new species are added to that total
  yearly. The question is not why weird new insects keep getting described by
  science, but why there aren’t more strange insects, spiders and other
  relatives with extra legs being discovered daily. Research suggests that at
  least 5m insect species exist, and insects and their relatives (arthropods)
  make up 85% of all known animal species. To put that in context, there are as
  many species of just ladybirds as there are of all mammals combined. The
  International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened
  Species is a good benchmark to get a sense of how little we know. IUCN is the
  primary information source on the global conservation status of animal
  species, but its database lists only 1.3% of known insect species for
  evaluation. For the entire category of insects, the most species-rich animals
  on our planet, IUCN’s data table simply says “insufficient coverage”. It
  simply doesn’t have enough data to estimate the percentage of threatened
  insect species. Naming and describing is just the first step of understanding
  and preserving our biological diversity. For many species, we have no idea
  where they live, what they eat, or what their lives are like. Of the insects
  listed in the IUCN database, 26% are listed as “data deficient”. This adorable
  little willowherb leafcutter bee is extinct in the UK, and we don’t know
  enough about it to say much more than that. By focusing on large, charismatic
  animals, we miss understanding the little animals that run our world and
  provide essential ecosystem services. It’s little invertebrates that pollinate
  plants, feed birds and other animals, and keep soils healthy. They deserve to
  be studied as much, or more, than their bigger vertebrate kin. Concentrating
  on common threats to animals, big and small, can help us make better choices
  about prioritising research and conservation. Gwen Pearson is adjunct faculty
