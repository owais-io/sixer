  It’s a sight that makes even the most hard-hearted millennial coo: an
  octogenarian couple expressing their affection towards one another. But Helen
  Mirren has railed against being so “insulting”, saying such condescension
  makes her want to tell people to “fuck off”. The actor said the hardest part
  of turning 80 last month was the “condescension” she was forced to endure when
  holding hands in public with her husband, Taylor Hackford. Speaking to the
  Times while promoting the release of her latest film, The Thursday Murder
  Club, she said: “It really annoys me. “If my husband and I are holding hands,
  someone might say: ‘Oh, look. How sweet.’ It’s like, excuse my language: ‘Fuck
  off.’ There’s something very condescending about some people’s attitudes and I
  think they think they are being kind and generous. But they’re not. They’re
  being insulting.” She recalled the words of her mother, who told her never to
  be afraid of getting older, and said there were great things about ageing: You
  “lose certain stuff but you gain other stuff”. “The tech bros think their
  billions are somehow going to hold back time,” she said. “They haven’t learnt
  my mum’s lesson. It’s a natural wave of life that has been going on for
  billions of years and it’s beautiful to be part of that wave. “It’s what
  humanity is all about in the end. So it’s important not to wimp out. You’re
  not going to be 30 when you’re 50. You’re just not.” Mirren has been reminded
  of mortality throughout her life by the deaths of loved ones. Her younger
  brother, Peter, died of skin cancer at 54 in 2002, and her stepson Rio
  Hackford died at 51 of cancer in 2022. “As you travel through life you realise
  death is absolutely part of life. And it’s always tragic and it can happen
  when you’re young,” she said. In The Thursday Murder Club, Mirren playing the
  former spy Elizabeth, who runs a murder investigation group alongside fellow
  residents of a retirement community. She said she loved the idea that life
  could continue to be beautiful while living in a residential home, and that
  she had been a fan of the story long before she was asked to be in the film.
  “Girlfriends recommended the first one,” she said, which was published in
  2020. “And it was so original, so drenched in charm: this eccentric British
  character thing mixed with murder mystery, set in a retirement home where
  people are in full possession of the faculties they had in their professional
  lives but want to use their brilliance again.” The Thursday Murder Club is in
  cinemas from 22 August, and on Netflix from 28 August.
