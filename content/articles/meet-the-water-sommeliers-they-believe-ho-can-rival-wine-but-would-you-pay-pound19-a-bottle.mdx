  For diners at a fancy restaurant in Cheshire, there is now a new twist to the
  usual routine. First comes La Popote’s menu, created by the owners, the chef
  Joe Rawlins and Gaëlle Radigon, who live upstairs with their children. Next
  comes the wine list, which includes more than 100 bottles. And then, in what
  is very much a first for Cheshire, a water list. Rawlins, 32, presents the new
  menu as I get comfy in the dining room in a converted redbrick barn in Marton,
  a village halfway between Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent. A choice of seven
  waters ranges from a £5 bottle of Crag, which comes from the nearby Peak
  District, to Vidago, a mineral-rich water from a Portuguese spa town, which
  will cost you £19. At a loss as to why I would need a water menu – or how a
  bottle could cost more than I would spend on wine – I consult La Popote’s
  water sommelier. Doran Binder, who created the menu, is part of a growing
  global mission of water evangelists with an unquenchable conviction. For
  Binder and his ilk, water has for too long been sidelined. He believes it
  deserves to be celebrated as a proper drink. “Water is a beautiful thing and I
  just want people to experiment and enjoy it in a way that they’ve never done
  before,” says Binder, 53, whose brimming passion gives his speech a staccato
  energy. Sensing my scepticism, he tells me it’s OK to laugh at the concept of
  water connoisseurship. “I’ve been trying to get restaurants to do this for
  years and I think people are nervous, because you’re either going to be a
  pioneer or a joke. It’s a gamble, but it’s actually better when people laugh,
  because, to me, it just shows how poor our relationship with water is.” I go
  for the crab starter, a classic mayonnaise-based dish with fennel and apple.
  “I’d probably try the Lauretana, or maybe Icelandic Glacial Water if you
  didn’t want sparkling, just because it’s also super-low and isn’t going to
  overpower the delicate crab,” says Binder, whose Viking-red beard (he is half
  Danish) inspired his online persona, the Bearded Water Sommelier. He tells me
  he gets 7m views a month across social media. “Super-low” refers to the
  minerality of water, the crucial factor in determining its taste. I am a water
  laggard, I warn Binder, who is helping to train the restaurant’s waiting
  staff. I never order bottled water and quite like my local hard,
  limescale-rich London tap water, with its notes of chlorine. Other than
  briefly noting the softer tap water in other parts of the country, I have
  rarely given water a second thought. Anyway, mineral content can be measured
  by evaporating a sample and weighing what is left as milligrams per litre of
  total dissolved solids (TDS). We are talking sodium, calcium, magnesium and
  potassium. Low‑TDS, or soft, waters are delicate and have changed little since
  they fell from the sky, whether they have been locked in a glacier or cycled
  quickly through a spring. High-TDS, or hard, waters may have spent years
  sloshing around rocks, absorbing minerals underground. Geology dictates the
  combination and quantity of these minerals and creates a water’s taste. “If
  it’s sodium, it’s salty. If it’s calcium, it’s slightly sweet. And if it’s
  magnesium, it’s slightly bitter,” Binder says. I go for the Lauretana (£12 a
  bottle), a gently carbonated spring water from the Piedmont region in
  north-west Italy. It has a TDS of just 14, which is about as low as it gets. A
  waiter pours me a glass. “We always serve water in wine glasses; it shows it
  respect,” says Binder, who also drinks it only at room temperature – he says
  chilling it kills any flavour. I swill a sip around my mouth before drinking.
  It’s a weird sensation. The water is so soft and smooth that it almost slides,
  rather than flows, off my tongue. It’s like drinking an Hermès scarf. Yet, a
  second later, I am left with a tacky, metallic dryness in my mouth – something
  to do with the water’s low pH level, apparently. When I follow a forkful of
  salty crab with another sip, the dryness goes away and the water enhances the
  crab’s creaminess. It works strangely well. During a fuller tasting session
  after lunch, Binder guides me to the opposite end of the scale with a glass of
  Vichy Célestins (£9), from the spa town of Vichy in central France. Its huge
  TDS of more than 3,300 (UK tap water tends to be below 400) is evident the
  second I take a sip. It takes me a moment to work out what is going on. “Tell
  me that isn’t flipping nuts!” Binder says, almost levitating as he watches me.
  “This is my favourite water in the world.” It has a sweet brackishness and a
  gentle, natural fizz (many waters absorb CO2 underground). It’s unlike
  anything I have tasted, like a softened, strangely moreish seawater. Binder
  recommends it as a complement to heavier dishes such as beef. Binder and La
  Popote see an opportunity in the shift away from booze, positioning water as a
  rival not just to wine, but also to the low- or no-alcohol drinks, seltzers
  and mocktails that are flooding the market. “Even in France, people are saying
  they want more non-alcoholic choices,” says Radigon, 37, who met Rawlins at
  another restaurant. They took over La Popote in 2019. “When I was pregnant, I
  found it was so limited. We need to move on with what people want.” If health
  is driving the shift, even if that means “zebra” drinking – alternating
  between booze and no alcohol – then hydro evangelists believe that waters of
  note are going to be hard to beat when so many alternatives are packed with
  sugar and additives. *** Yet even Binder was sceptical not long ago. He had
  been working in the haircare industry in New York when, after a divorce, he
  bought the Crag Inn, a failing pub in the Peak District, about 10 miles from
  La Popote. He thought about reviving it, despite being teetotal, while
  regularly travelling back to New York for work. But when he got the pub’s
  neglected spring fixed and tested, he learned he was sitting on a liquid
  goldmine of uncommonly clean, silky water. “I phoned Doran when he was in New
  York and said: ‘You should sell everything you’ve got, come back here and
  start bottling this stuff,’” says Richard Taylor, a veteran water supply
  engineer at Blair Water Group, who did the work. By 2018, Binder had quit his
  job to launch Crag spring water, turning the pub into a ramshackle bottling
  plant with a water bar for tastings. Today, a team of 15 produces more than
  12,000 bottles a week from the spring under the pub’s car park. They use only
  reusable glass bottles, which the company collects when it delivers. La Popote
  was one of the first restaurants to sign up. Other customers have included
  Sketch, the high-end restaurant in Mayfair, London, and the grocery service
  Modern Milkman. Stunned by early interest, Binder wanted to learn more about
  his water. He heard about Michael Mascha, an Austrian in Texas whom Binder
  describes as the “godfather of water”. An original 1990s tech guy, Mascha lost
  out in the first dotcom bust. At about the same time, his cardiologist advised
  him to give up wine. Although he had a cellar full of it, he reluctantly
  agreed to stick to water. Frustrated by the standard “still or sparkling?”
  offer, he began discovering new labels. In 2002, he founded FineWaters, which
  now has a spin-off society, academy, conference and consulting arm. His book
  of the same name is a guide to 100 premium waters, from Abatilles in France to
  Zaječická hořká, a rich Czech water that has been prized for its purported
  health benefits since the 16th century. Mascha runs an online training course
  for fellow enthusiasts and has certified more than 100 sommeliers, including
  Binder. He says demand is fizzing. “We’re finally moving away from considering
  water just for hydration and towards water as an experience,” he says. He is
  not alone in spotting momentum at the top end of the market. “What feels
  different now is the kind of customer we’re getting,” says Michael Tanousis,
  who in 2007 launched the British online water boutique Aqua Amore, which has
  seen demand grow steadily in recent years. “People are coming to us looking
  for specifics, not just ‘bottled water’. It’s ‘low-sodium’ or ‘high-mineral’,
  or more provenance-driven.” But isn’t bottled water an environmental disaster?
  Mascha acknowledges the impact of the wider industry, but says the vast
  majority of what people buy is processed. “It’s basically tap water that runs
  into a factory and then people drive to supermarkets to buy plastic bottles
  and take it home; it’s totally stupid,” he says. (If it doesn’t say “natural”,
  “spring” or “mineral” on the bottle, it’s probably packaged tap water.) He
  doesn’t see premium bottles as an alternative to tap water, which he drinks,
  but to wine or other occasional drinks. “What we’re talking about is waters
  that are unique, that have a terroir and deserve to be bottled,” Mascha says.
  Binder urges more water brands to commit to collecting reusable glass bottles;
  while glass bottles can be recycled, they often aren’t, which wastes even more
  of the huge amount of energy it takes to make and ship them. Rawlins may feel
  like a pioneer, but water menus are not new. Mascha says more than a dozen
  restaurants in the US have one. In the UK, Claridge’s tried one in 2007, but
  it didn’t stick. A growing community of water sommeliers and enthusiasts
  believe consumers are now ready after years in which water has served only as
  a staple. “In Italy or France, people have a much better understanding, but
  here there has been a bit of a disconnect,” says Milin Patel, an environmental
  scientist turned drinking water expert in south-west London. “I also don’t
  think Peckham Spring did us any favours,” he adds, recalling a 1992 episode of
  Only Fools and Horses (Mother Nature’s Son) in which Del Boy fraudulently
  bottled tap water in his flat. As part of his work, Patel carries out water
  tastings for school and corporate groups. “You see it in their eyes. They’re
  like: ‘Oh, wow, I’ve never looked at water in this way,’” he says. He hopes
  growing understanding of water may inspire new respect for all our water uses
  and sources. Growing awareness has inspired producers, too. In a few months’
  time, Murray Diplock will start selling the spring water that irrigates his
  cress farm from a chalk aquifer in the Test valley in Hampshire. Diplock and
  his family have always drunk the water themselves, filling old milk bottles
  with it. He has now invested in a small bottling plant and created a brand:
  Chorq. As well as using standard glass bottles, Diplock wants to lean into the
  no-alcohol market with carbonated Chorq in champagne-style bottles with corks
  that pop. “We want to start running courses and tastings to help explain to
  people what we’re doing and why,” he says. “Water is piquing everyone’s
  interest and we’re hoping it’s about to really take off.” Back in Cheshire,
  Rawlins hopes to add a water night to the steak and cheese nights he already
  offers. He insists the menu is no gimmick. “We might chop and change the
  waters, but the list is here to stay,” he says. Before I leave La Popote, I
  try the £19 Vidago, which is sold in limited numbers in Lalique-like frosted
  bottles. With a TDS of nearly 3,000, it’s almost as rich as Vichy Célestins,
  but it tastes more gently salted. I try another sip with some Parma ham; the
  salt in the water seems to disappear as the tastes mingle in my mouth. Whether
  or not I have soaked up all of Binder’s zeal, the experience has been
  eye-opening – and certainly more mindful than my usual approach to food and
  drink, which involves consuming it like a hungry pelican. “I spend my life
  playing with food and water like this and even now it’s still flipping
  mind-blowing for me,” Binder says. He pours out one more glass and hands it to
  me: “Wait till you try this ...” • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised
