  James Maddison faces a long period on the sidelines after Tottenham confirmed
  the midfielder had ruptured an anterior cruciate knee ligament. The England
  international sustained the injury during a pre-season game against Newcastle
  in Seoul and is to have an operation. Spurs said: “We can confirm that James
  Maddison will undergo surgery for a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his
  right knee … His surgery will take place in the coming days and, following
  that, James will then begin his rehabilitation with our medical team. Everyone
  at Tottenham Hotspur wishes James a full and speedy recovery. We will be
  supporting him every step of the way.” Maddison collapsed in pain with no one
  around him and left the pitch on a stretcher in the 86th minute. The
  28-year-old missed the end of last season with a knee injury but returned last
  month to feature under the new head coach, Thomas Frank. His creative role
  could be filled by Mohammed Kudus, the 25-year-old Ghana international whom
  Spurs bought for £54.5m in the summer. Kudus played all 90 minutes on Thursday
  night in a pre-season friendly as the former Spurs captain Harry Kane scored
  and missed a penalty in Bayern Munich’s 4-0 win over Tottenham at the Allianz
  Arena. Kane put Bayern in front in the first half they dominated, latching on
  to a Michael Olise pass to fire home. João Palhinha, making his first start in
  Spurs colours since his loan move from Bayern, then gave away a penalty for a
  foul on Josip Stanisic, but Kane miscued his effort. Kane had a shot cleared
  off the line and Luis Díaz, on his first start after his move from Liverpool,
  was unable to force home the rebound as Spurs held out until half-time. In the
  second half, Bayern continued to dominate, with Kingsley Coman, and teenagers
  Lennart Karl and Jonah Kusi-Asare getting on the scoresheet. “We were
  obviously playing a very good team,” Frank, whose side now go to face Paris
  Saint-Germain in the Uefa Super Cup next Wednesday, told the Tottenham
  website. “Bayern in my opinion are one of the teams that probably are
  favourites to win the Champions League. They hit a good level, we didn’t hit a
  good level. That’s a bad combination but we will learn from this one. “I
  definitely got some answers that we will look into but we will calmly reflect
  on it after the game now and look through it. Also it seems like we lacked
  some energy somehow which we need to find – no team can play without that
  energy. “We will 100% be ready for that [the Super Cup], I’m not in doubt
  about that. There are six days ahead, we have a normal week for the first time
  in the last two weeks so with everything – just getting down, less travel,
  energise them, three or four good sessions – then we will be ready against
  PSG.” Meanwhile, West Ham have confirmed Michail Antonio will not be signing a
  new contract. Antonio’s deal expired at the end of June but West Ham did not
  rule out keeping the forward, who is playing again after a serious car crash.
  They said on 8 June that an announcement would be made when “right and
  appropriate”. Antonio has played 45 minutes for the under-21 development team
  during pre-season. The 35-year-old joined from Nottingham Forest in 2015 and
  made 323 appearances, scoring 83 goals. West Ham said: “The club will continue
  to support and assist him in his ongoing rehabilitation, offering him access
  to training, facilities and medical care if needed. “Dialogue continues over
  his future involvement with the club in an alternative capacity – including
  one that would enable others to benefit from his experience and leadership
  qualities – and he will for ever hold a special place in our 130-year history.
  Everyone at West Ham would like to sincerely thank Michail for his
  outstanding, dedicated service in a claret-and-blue shirt over the last 10
  years.”
