  Wave of Spanish politicians edit CVs over incorrect claims of degrees and
  diplomas

  It began as a confession by a rising star in Spain’s conservative People’s
  party that her CV was not quite all it seemed. Last month Noelia Núñez, 33, a
  member of the PP’s steering committee, was forced to admit she had never in
  fact completed her double degree in law and public administration. She
  apologised and stood down – a move rarely seen in the country. Since then,
  however, Núñez’s contrition seems to have launched a trend, with a wave of mea
  culpas from politicians of various parties rushing to revise – downwards –
  their educational achievements. Some have even resigned, emulating Núñez, who
  said: “I apologise to anyone who feels disappointed but I also believe it’s
  not enough to say sorry.” This week Ana Millán, a senior figure in Madrid’s
  PP-run regional government, became the latest to admit there were errors in
  her official CV, downgrading a degree in political science to a diploma in
  public administration. Ignacio Higuera, a member of the far-right Vox party in
  the Extremadura regional government, had to back down on claims he had a
  degree in marketing when reports emerged that the university in question had
  not offered the course at the time. He has resigned. José María Ángel, a
  Socialist party member overseeing recovery efforts after the disastrous
  flooding in Valencia last October that left 220 dead, also stepped down after
  it was alleged he had faked a degree in order to get a civil service job. Also
  in Valencia, the Socialist party had to rectify the CV of Pilar Bernabé, the
  government’s regional delegate, to reflect that she had never completed her
  degrees in Spanish linguistics and audiovisual communication. Juan Manuel
  Moreno, the president of the PP-led Andalusian regional government, has been
  asked to explain the apparent vicissitudes of his CV, which stated in 2000
  that he had a degree in business management. The qualification was modified in
  2004 to “studies in business management”, before being upgraded in 2008 to a
  master’s in the same subject. Pedro Rollán, the president of the senate and
  another member of the PP, had to remove from his CV a diploma and a master’s
  in marketing after a TV programme reported that the college where he studied
  did not issue diplomas. One of the most sensational cases, however, predates
  this summer’s zeal for clarifications. Cristina Cifuentes, then the PP
  president of Madrid’s regional government, was accused in 2018 of claiming a
  master’s degree in business management from the King Juan Carlos University in
  Madrid without ever having attended classes or written a dissertation. When
  Cifuentes produced a certificate to back up her claim, two of three people
  whose names appeared on it said their signatures had been forged. Her downfall
  was complete when CCTV footage showed her having her bag searched by a store
  detective after allegedly stealing two pots of face cream. Cifuentes said the
  footage showed nothing more than an “involuntary mistake” but said she was
  resigning nonetheless to spare her colleagues and family any further
  embarrassment.
