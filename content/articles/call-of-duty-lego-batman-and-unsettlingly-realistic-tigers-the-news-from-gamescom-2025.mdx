  If you are in Cologne this week, you will find the place overtaken by cheerful
  nerds, as Gamescom, the world’s biggest gaming event, descends upon the city
  once again. (I first went in 2009 – before that it used to be held in Leipzig,
  a city home to a famous absinthe bar; perhaps this is why my memories of it
  are somewhat hazy.) Over 300,000 people are expected to visit the Koelnmesse
  to play upcoming games and enjoy each other’s company, to the extent that it’s
  possible to enjoy anyone’s company in a giant crowded convention hall with
  woefully insufficient food options. The event began, as is now tradition, with
  a showcase of games (pdf) whose publishers could afford the hundreds of
  thousands of euros necessary to show a trailer on an official livestream.
  (There was also a live performance of a piece of music from Clair Obscur:
  Expedition 33, the big, weird French hit of the year so far, as a welcome
  interlude.) As ever, I am here to spare you from watching a full two hours of
  trailers and pick out the most interesting stuff. Without further ado: The big
  hitters Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was the big opener: our reporter Alyssa
  Mercante got a full introduction to its futuristic military paranoia, which
  you can read about later this week. PlayStation is being pretty quiet in
  general at the moment, but Sony and Sucker Punch’s Japanese historical action
  game Ghost of Yōtei made an appearance and is looking honestly splendid –
  after Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ very successful take on feudal Japan earlier
  this year, samurai appreciators are truly being spoiled this year. It’ll be
  getting some extra multiplayer content in 2026. Capcom’s Resident Evil
  Requiem, meanwhile, came out with an upsetting new demo in which its young
  protagonist, Grace, follows her mother around a darkened apartment complex
  full of supernatural murderers; attenders will be able to play it, too. And
  there was a first look at the next game from the developers of Black Myth:
  Wukong, the huge Chinese folklore-based hit from last year, featuring a
  ghost-catching god riding on a gigantic, unsettlingly realistic-looking tiger.
  It’s called Black Myth: Zhong Kui. For me, though, the biggest news was new
  footage of Hollow Knight: Silksong, the mysterious sequel to one of my
  favourite games of all time. We haven’t seen anything at all of this game
  since 2022. It is still due to launch this year, and I am wildly jealous of
  anyone who gets to play the demo on the show floor. Unexpected announcements
  World of Tanks – a game that is exactly what it sounds like – has been around
  for ever, and to be honest I remain as baffled by it today as I was in the
  early 2010s, when its immense popularity in Europe and Russia made it one of
  the biggest games in the world. Its forthcoming 2.0 update is a huge presence
  at the show, but its developer Wargaming also has a brand new game coming out
  … which also very prominently features tanks. Heat is the OTT cartoonish
  counterpart to World of Tanks’ historical battlefields, and it does look
  rather fun. We also saw a new game from Ron Gilbert, creator of Monkey Island
  (and Maniac Mansion, for the real OGs). It’s not a pixel art adventure game
  like his previous work. Instead, Death By Scrolling is a shooter where you’re
  stuck in purgatory trying to avoid the Grim Reaper. There’s a distinct Vampire
  Survivors look to this. Most gladdeningly, though, there’s a new Lego Batman
  game that looks genuinely delightful. It’s called Lego Batman: Legacy of the
  Dark Knight, and it takes you on the whole Bruce Wayne journey from origin to
  Gotham hero, drawing on everything from the Nolan shows and comics to the
  beloved Arkham Batman games. Old games getting new stuff A couple of notable
  announcements from a seemingly endless stream of updates to existing games.
  Venerable online role-playing game World of Warcraft is huge in Germany, so
  Gamescom is a good place for it to debut its new Midnight expansion: it’s
  playable on the show floor, and Blizzard is running several developer panels
  dishing more details. Cult of the Lamb, a deceptively cute game about a
  resurrected sacrificial lamb who murders demon heretics while building his own
  devoted following, is also getting a “full-length” new chapter called
  Woolhaven. Modern updates to cult-classic series from the 00s There’s a huge
  trend this year for resurrecting fondly remembered but not particularly
  bestselling game properties from a couple of decades ago, perhaps powered by
  the huge success of remasters such as Capcom’s Resident Evil re-runs. Ninja
  Gaiden 4 is looking exactly as violent and challenging as you’d want if you
  suffered through the original games on Xbox. Silent Hill f, meanwhile, which
  our reporter Tom Regan recently played in Japan, looks truly horrifying, with
  its traumatised schoolgirls, unnatural convulsing skinless monsters and eerily
  deserted smalltown Japanese setting. And it’s not officially a new Dead Space
  game, but Bloober Team’s new sci-fi horror Cronos: The New Dawn looks like the
  Dead Space spiritual successor we truly deserve. Lastly: this one is a sequel
  to a game from the 90s, but nonetheless, fingers crossed for Vampire: The
  Masquerade Bloodlines 2, which has been in development hell for an absolute
  age. It’s out 21 October, and its first-person vamp fighting looked
  potentially exciting. We’ve got a couple of reporters on the ground in
  Germany, so look out for more from Gamescom very soon. In the meantime, here
  is a very useful Steam event page showing pretty much every game that’s
  playable at the show (or that debuted a trailer), which is an extremely good
  idea – it makes it much easier to wishlist and keep track of the ones that
  catch your eye. What to play I have just started playing Herdling, in which
  you are an alpine shepherd guiding a herd of strange creatures out of a grimy
  city and back to their natural mountain habitat. The creatures themselves are
  rather sombre things, awkward fluffy mammoths with curly horns and dolorous
  eyes. It reminds me of The Last Guardian, except instead of trying to guide
  just one obstinate flying cat-giant through a crumbling ruin, there are
  several creature-friends to wrangle, of various sizes (the little ones are
  more lively). I’m finding it a little awkward to play, because the animals
  have minds of their own, and I must admit that the crushing sense of
  responsibility that I feel for them is making my slightly worried about what
  lies ahead; I’ve been here before with these emotionally manipulative indie
  games. Available on: PS5, Xbox, Switch, PC Estimated playtime: 4-6 hours What
  to read Thomas Hobbs investigates the making of 50 Cent: Bulletproof, the
  faintly ludicrous but memorable 2005 shooter starring the rapper himself – who
  the development team never even met: “This was a game about these dudes from
  the hood, and yet here was this white guy from the north-west of England
  writing all their in-game dialogue.” Every now and then, someone writes in to
  ask why we don’t cover smartphone games much on the Guardian; the truth is
  that despite the many millions of people who play games on their phones, very
  few seem to want to read about them. Longtime games journalist Maddy Myers
  probes this interesting discrepancy over at MobileGamer. Someone has gone to
  the trouble of recreating several of the excellent songs from Netflix mega-hit
  KPop Demon Hunters within Animal Crossing (via Kotaku). I get such a kick out
  of the effort put into this beautifully pointless creativity. What to click
