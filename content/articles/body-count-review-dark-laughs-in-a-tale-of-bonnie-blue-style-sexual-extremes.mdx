  ‘I would love you to rearrange my insides.” It’s a shocking line that would
  stand out in an Edinburgh fringe show but belongs to OnlyFans content creator
  Bonnie Blue, whose invitation to more than 1,000 men to have sex with her over
  12 hours is the subject of a Channel 4 documentary. In actor-writer Issy
  Knowles’ monologue, the setup is similar: on a stage dominated by a bed and
  littered with condoms, Pollie arrives in a blue silk dressing gown to meet a
  thousand subscribers as she grants them each a freebie. Pollie is given her
  own queasy lines of enticement to her fans. But how do you satirise a
  phenomenon – sex as competitive sport – that is already so extreme in nature?
  Knowles humorously deadpans Pollie’s insistence that she finds her enterprise
  erotic, saying how sexy it is to oversee hundreds of legal waivers for the
  men. Pollie’s discovery that her first visitor is above the age of consent is
  played as comic frustration, though the question of the character’s predatory
  behaviour is not deeply pursued. Wearing fake plastic buttocks and breasts,
  Knowles trains a steely gaze and fixed smile on the audience, who are given
  the choice to wear balaclavas, like the men queueing for their turn, yet the
  scattering of masked theatregoers adds little to the atmosphere. Knowles
  considers Pollie’s religious upbringing and first boyfriends but also how
  society creates and reacts to such sexual extremities. This is done through a
  voiceover of interview-style questions, many of which are more probing than in
  Channel 4’s documentary. Pollie compares her “liberating” work with her past
  career as a consultant, the office tasks choreographed as sex acts. The
  movement direction is frequently bold to match the bluntness of the script.
  The flashbacks can be indistinctive but Knowles also delves into the minds of
  the men in the queue, generally less held to account than OnlyFans stars, and
  their parasocial relationships with Pollie. She plays an incel spouting
  conspiracy theories whose violent fantasies are followed by erectile
  dysfunction. The writing balances dark humour with serious assessment of the
  men’s discontent, anger and desire for control, recognising the role, too, of
  ragebait in Pollie’s success (“hate is money … money is power”). She is always
  compelling in the troubling encounters with expectant subscribers who believe
  they are not just “only” fans. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25
  August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
