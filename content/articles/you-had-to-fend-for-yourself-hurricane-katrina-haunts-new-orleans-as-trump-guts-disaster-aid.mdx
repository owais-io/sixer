  Darren McKinney grew up in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward. When Hurricane
  Katrina struck 20 years ago this week, he watched his neighborhood wash away.
  From his second floor apartment, he saw flood waters rise up to his window. “I
  had no food at all, no water, no electricity,” he recounted one rainy day this
  month, while taking a break from his job leading home restoration in the
  neighborhood as field operations director of the non-profit lowernine.org.
  After being trapped inside for four days, city officials rescued McKinney in a
  boat and dropped him off on a nearby bridge. He was told a military truck
  would bring him to an emergency shelter in the city’s superdome, but a vehicle
  never arrived because the shelter reached capacity. He was forced to walk to
  an evacuation point downtown. “You had to fend for yourself,” he said. “There
  just wasn’t enough shelter, wasn’t enough support.” Friends helped McKinney
  evacuate to Houston, Texas. Months later, when he returned to the city, he
  found his home in “real bad condition”. He eventually settled into a trailer
  provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). During his stay in
  the temporary home, he began to hear news reports that some Fema trailers were
  found to have high levels of the harmful chemical formaldehyde. With nowhere
  else to stay, he tried to ignore those reports. “What could you do?” he asked.
  The federal response to Katrina, particularly by Fema, came under intense
  scrutiny after the hurricane, which killed at least 1,833 people. In New
  Orleans, residents spray-painted curses at Fema on their boarded-up homes and
  wore T-shirts around the city that bore the slogan: “FEMA – Federal Employees
  Missing in Action.” Some on the right have called to shrink the agency or even
  abolish it. In recent months, the Trump administration has picked up on those
  calls, defunding key Fema programs, laying off hundreds of staffers, and
  threatening to dismantle the agency completely. But McKinney believes the
  administration’s policies will leave New Orleans worse prepared for future
  hurricanes. “You don’t know when you’re gonna have another disaster like
  that,” he said. “For people that don’t have money, without Fema, how you going
  to help them out?” In recent weeks, Donald Trump has walked back promises to
  abolish Fema. But disaster management experts fear the changes he has made
  will still leave the US just as underprepared to take on a hurricane like
  Katrina as it was in 2005. “It has been so demoralizing to realize how closely
  aligned we have become again to what Fema looked like pre-Katrina, and how
  quickly we’ve backslid on the progress of the last 20 years,” said Samantha
  Montano, a disaster response expert at Massachusetts Maritime Academy and
  author of the book Disasterology. ‘State-led, federally supported’ Since
  re-entering the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly called for states
  to bear more responsibility for disasters, signing a March executive order
  saying municipalities should “play a more active and significant role” in
  national resilience and preparedness. “If they can’t handle it, they shouldn’t
  be governor,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in June, as he spoke
  about a plan to “wean” states off Fema assistance. But states have always led
  disaster response, said Craig Fugate, who directed Fema from 2009-2017. “The
  current administration says states should lead, we should support, [but]
  that’s what it’s always been,” he said. “The federal government, at the
  direction of the president, through Fema, supports the governor.” Cuts at Fema
  could have particularly negative implications for poor, climate-vulnerable
  states like Louisiana, which received the most direct assistance from Fema
  between January 2015 and April 2024, according to data collected for the
  Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Disaster Dollar Database. “For
  states that are oftentimes underresourced, Fema gives the support that is
  needed to navigate disasters, both in the form of financial assistance and
  providing technical expertise,” said Reggie Ferreira, who directs the disaster
  resilience leadership academy at Tulane University in New Orleans. But even
  wealthier states will probably struggle to weather disasters without the
  agency’s support, said Montano. “The importance of Fema really just can’t be
  overstated. They’re the last line of defense that we really have in moments of
  crisis,” she said. “We know that our state and local capacity to respond to
  disasters in most parts of the country is relatively limited. And we know that
  our needs related to disasters are increasing in the context of climate
  change.” ‘Brain drain’ After Katrina struck New Orleans in August 2005, the
  support Fema was able to provide had dwindled due to policies enacted by
  former president George W Bush. “When Katrina happened, it’s really important
  to remember that Fema had just gone through a shock of their own,” said
  Montano. “Going into Katrina, Fema was deeply unprepared as an agency, which
  is a huge reason for the failure in the response.” In the wake of the 2001
  9/11 attacks, the Bush administration launched a government-wide
  reorganization to focus on the threat of terrorism, cutting disaster programs
  and, in 2003, stripping Fema of its independent, cabinet-level status. The
  agency was then absorbed into the newly created Department of Homeland
  Security. “The attention was only on terrorism at the expense of anything
  else,” said Fugate. The shifts at Fema led to a mass exodus of staff. Some –
  including senior leadership – were relieved of their duties and reassigned to
  terrorism-related posts, while others who were reportedly frustrated with the
  restructure resigned. That “brain drain” was a key reason that Fema was not
  able to provide an adequate response to Katrina, said Montano. Fugate said
  what is happening at the agency today is “very similar” to that moment. Under
  Trump, an estimated one-third of Fema’s workforce has been eliminated due to
  layoffs, firings and voluntary buyouts. In recent weeks, the Trump
  administration has also reportedly sent some remaining Fema staff to help
  speed the hiring of immigration enforcement agents. Lt Gen Russel Honoré, who
  led the military response to Hurricane Katrina, had choice words about the
  decision. “That adds insult to injury,” he said. “I really think these fucking
  people are stuck on stupid.” The staffing cuts threaten the relationships
  between state and federal officials, said Stephen Murphy, former planning
  section chief for New Orleans’s homeland security and emergency preparedness
  office. That could make disaster response less efficient. “When you have a
  strong team, a network, everybody has built trust in one another because
  they’ve been out there together, they’ve bled for one another,” said Murphy,
  who now leads Tulane University’s disaster management program. “When you
  disrupt that, you’re playing with fire.” The federal changes are difficult to
  witness, said Murphy, who said Katrina inspired his career in disaster
  response. When it struck, he had moved to New Orleans only six weeks earlier
  to pursue a graduate degree in emergency and security, expecting to focus
  primarily on the threat of terrorism. Classes had not even started when, as
  Katrina was gaining strength over the Gulf of Mexico, he decided to evacuate
  his new home. “As I was pulling out of my neighborhood, some new friends that
  I’d met in town said: ‘Hey, where are you going? We’re going to have a
  party,’” he remembered from his New Orleans office. “I had my kayak in my
  truck, and I asked: ‘OK, you want me to leave this for you?’ I didn’t realize
  how terrible a joke that would be.” In its aftermath, Murphy decided to devote
  his life to better managing disasters like Katrina, as did many others in the
  field. “There’s been tremendous improvements and growth since then,” said
  Murphy. “To dismantle a lot of what has been done does feel like a little bit
  of a gut punch.” Cutting funding, undercutting progress After Katrina, Fema
  also increased funding for disaster relief and mitigation. But under Trump,
  billions of those dollars have dried up. “A lot of the federal grants and
  money that helped fortify some of the most vulnerable areas, including New
  Orleans, are getting clawed back,” said Murphy. “You can’t just turn the
  spigot off and expect the system to still work.” Some of the Trump
  administration’s actions at Fema directly violate policies enacted by
  lawmakers to prevent future botched disaster responses, said Honoré. That
  includes the president’s January appointment of a new administrator for the
  agency. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which Congress
  passed in 2006, requires all Fema administrators to have experience in
  disaster management. The provision was inspired by Bush’s Fema administrator
  Michael Brown, who was critiqued for his limited background in the field. In
  the 19 years since the bill’s passage, only “seasoned emergency managers” have
  succeeded Brown, said Honoré. But that all changed when Trump picked David
  Richardson – who appears to have no disaster management experience – for the
  post, he said. Before leading Fema, Richardson oversaw a Department of
  Homeland Security program focused on weapons of mass destruction. In a June
  briefing, Richardson told personnel he was unaware that the US had a hurricane
  season, which the White House later said was a “joke”. The 2006 policy also
  empowered Fema to act with greater flexibility and clearer authority in
  emergency management, and designated its administrator as a principal
  presidential adviser. Trump does not appear to be following those provisions,
  Honoré said. As deadly floods overwhelmed Texas last month, Fema officials
  told CNN they were not able to pre-position search and rescue crews in the
  region because Trump’s homeland security secretary Kristi Noem insisted upon
  personally approving all agency contracts and grants over $100,000 before
  funds were disbursed. “Genius,” Honoré said sarcastically. This week, Fema
  employees wrote to Congress warning that the Trump administration’s changes at
  the agency could lead to another “catastrophe” on the scale of Hurricane
  Katrina. “The agency’s current trajectory reflects a clear departure from the
  intent” of the 2006 legislation,” they wrote. Daniel Llargués, Fema’s acting
  press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in the letter telling the New
  York Times the Trump administration “is committed to ensuring Fema delivers
  for the American people” and to cutting “red tape, inefficiency and outdated
  processes” in the agency. Fema did not respond to questions from the Guardian
  for this article. Equity threatened In the absence of federal support after
  Katrina, many advocacy groups worked to fill the gaps, particularly in the
  low-income communities of color that found it disproportionately difficult to
  rebuild. Even those non-governmental efforts have been undermined by Trump’s
  policies, said McKinney, the field operations director of lowernine.org. The
  organization has for years hosted international volunteers, but fewer want to
  travel to the US amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, he said. In May, the
  president also gutted AmeriCorps, leaving lowernine.org with fewer hands to
  help with their home construction efforts. “They cut the AmeriCorps funding
  [one] afternoon in the middle of a workday,” said Laura Paul, executive
  director of lowernine.org. “Our team had just taken a wall down on someone’s
  house that they were living in, and they just put their tools down and walked
  off site.” Trump has also ended grants to some environmental justice groups,
  including in New Orleans, further threatening efforts to promote equitable
  disaster recovery, while gutting Biden-era equity-focused government
  initiatives, including within Fema. “Fema, obviously, was not perfect in any
  way after Katrina,” said Montano. “But a lot of the progress on equity is just
  gone.” ‘More support, more help’ The scrutiny federal disaster response has
  received since Katrina is warranted, but Trump has moved in the wrong
  direction, said Betina James, a resident of New Orleans’s Hollygrove
  neighborhood. “We want more support, more help, not for them to take all that
  help away,” she said. From a senior citizens community meeting at the
  Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association’s Life Transformation Community
  Center this month, James recounted her experience after Katrina destroyed her
  house: Fema denied her request for a temporary shelter for two months, and
  when they finally approved it, the agency provided her with a trailer that had
  “no floor in the bedroom”. “It was just covered with carpet with nothing under
  it, so if you stepped on it, you’d go straight through to the ground,” she
  said. Officials provided a replacement, but living in it made her feel
  nauseated with burning eyes and itchy skin. She believes it was contaminated.
  At the senior citizens meeting, a dozen other residents chimed in with their
  harrowing Katrina experiences: stepping over human corpses in the streets and
  being left without shelter and financial aid. Some said they have even failed
  to receive adequate assistance during more recent disasters such as 2021’s
  Hurricane Ida. But those experiences should push officials to improve Fema,
  not gut it, said Terry Caesar, another senior attending the meeting. “It used
  to be when things broke, we took it to the shop to fix it,” he said. “You’re
  not supposed to throw it out.”
