  Frances Tiafoe is in his element when he talks passionately about the growing
  presence of black and mixed heritage players at the highest levels of men’s
  tennis. During a stroll on tournament grounds he reels off the names of
  players he competes with regularly on the tour. “Now they’re at a position
  where I have wars with them and go back and forth. So this is great, man. It’s
  great to see,” he says. “And then you have Giovanni [Mpetshi Perricard], you
  have Gaël [Monfils], who I looked up to.” Seconds after Tiafoe mentions his
  name, Monfils suddenly appears from around a corner as if magically summoned
  by the American’s utterance. His arrival naturally leads to a pause in this
  interview as an excited Tiafoe greets Monfils by heaping praise on his new
  haircut, particularly focusing his attention on the Frenchman’s sleek fade.
  Monfils responds with a compliment of his own: “You’re looking like a wedding
  day,” he says, laughing. This encounter perfectly encapsulates the dynamic
  between two different generations of black players in a sport where their
  success immediately marks them as trailblazers. Although they step on to the
  court with the sole intention of beating each other, there is also a deep
  understanding between them and they are extremely supportive. “He texts me all
  the time,” says Tiafoe. “He tells me, like: ‘Yo, you can do this.’ Don’t get
  it twisted, when he plays he still wants to beat my ass and so do I, but it’s
  just a lot of love.” Tiafoe, at No 14 in the rankings is the third-highest
  ranked US man behind Taylor Fritz, the world No 4, and Ben Shelton, who won
  the Toronto Masters 1000 on Thursday night, but in terms of name recognition
  the 27-year-old has become the most prominent US male tennis player in years.
  His matches attract NBA stars like Kevin Durant, he breaks bread with Taylor
  Swift and has earned a fan in Michelle Obama. In recent weeks Tiafoe has been
  name-dropped in songs from the rap duo Clipse and the rapper Wale. “I still
  think he’s the player on tour with the most clout, like every celebrity knows
  him, or he knows every celebrity. He’s mentioned in two rap songs, so he’s
  pretty iconic,” says Coco Gauff, laughing. Tiafoe, for his part, believes his
  burgeoning profile underlines the importance of tennis reaching beyond its
  traditional audience: “Just to be able to be in a position where I get
  crossover, people want to be a part of things I’m doing in a predominantly
  white sport. They see themselves in me, in the sport, and they want to get
  behind me. Hopefully I’m able to get that done,” he says. There is also simply
  nobody like Tiafoe. His extroverted character and bluntness can be abrasive to
  some spectators, but he is kind, warm and has time for everyone. Laughter is
  never far from his lips, which makes his energy infectious. He has also
  deliberately made a point of using his platform to promote female athletes.
  When he is not playing, he is often at WNBA games and he wears player jerseys
  throughout the tennis season during practice. He is friends with many female
  basketball players. “I think [female athletes] just need to get their
  flowers,” says Tiafoe. “They put in the work, just like we do. They just need
  to be getting their love, their notoriety, their compensation. Let them smell
  their flowers. That’s kind of what it is. And I think more women should
  support women, to be honest with you, because it’s a beautiful thing. It’s not
  just me showing up and supporting it. It’s me showing up and watching a good
  product.” In addition to his support for women’s sport, Tiafoe has also
  actively tried to help certain female tennis players follow in his path. His
  success has paved the way for others at the Junior Tennis Champions Center
  (JTCC), his childhood tennis club near Washington DC, particularly the WTA
  players Hailey Baptiste and Robin Montgomery. This year, while also working
  with Franklin Tiafoe, Frances’s twin brother, Baptiste has enjoyed a breakout
  season, reaching the top 50. Both players cite Tiafoe as a mentor they have
  constantly sought advice from and he has tried to be on hand to help them in
  any way he can. He takes great pride in their success. “I’m still young – I’ve
  still got a lot more to achieve. I still haven’t scratched the surface of my
  career. But with them, I’ve already won in so many ways,” says Tiafoe. “So
  it’s kind of how you look at the glass, but it’s amazing to be in that seat.
  It’s a blessing.” During tournaments, Tiafoe can sometimes be found training
  with other female players, which is still an unusual sight. He describes
  Jessica Pegula as his favourite training partner on the WTA: “She hits the
  ball so pure and right in pocket every time,” he says. “She’s pretty relaxed
  as well. But she doesn’t want to hit with me any more. She’s made some finals
  now in some slams, 1000s, and she doesn’t want to talk to me as much any more.
  She got too big time for me. She forgot about the little people.” Such is his
  jovial nature, Tiafoe is often the butt of jokes among his friends on the
  tour. They tease him for his questionable organisational skills, his lack of
  punctuality and his general unseriousness. His driving has also come under
  fire. Offered a platform to defend himself against his friends’ scorn, Tiafoe
  smiles. “I just recently got my license, so I was definitely shaky in the
  early days, probably when they were saying it,” says Tiafoe. “But I’m
  definitely nice [at driving]. I’m definitely [Lewis] Hamilton 2.0 behind the
  wheel so I don’t worry too much about it.” The story of Tiafoe’s past has
  already been told countless times, but it can never be repeated enough. The
  son of Sierra Leonean parents who immigrated to the United States, Tiafoe
  spent much of his formative years at the JTCC, where his father worked as a
  janitor. He has defied almost impossible odds to establish himself as one of
  the best tennis players in the world. After reaching his second grand slam
  semi-final at the US Open last year, when he lost to Fritz in five sets in
  heartbreaking fashion, this year Tiafoe will attempt to rediscover the magic
  on courts that have regularly inspired his best. Regardless of what awaits him
  as he enters the prime years of his career, however, it is obvious that in
  many ways Tiafoe has already won. “I’d tell guys from the [club] that I’d want
  to be a pro,” says Tiafoe. “They would just clown and not take it seriously. I
  was always like: ‘Don’t worry, man. I’m going to be the last person laughing.’
  Here we are today.”
