  Argentina’s 1976-83 military dictatorship tortured, killed and “disappeared”
  an estimated 30,000 people – political opponents, students, artists, union
  leaders: anyone it deemed a threat. Hundreds of babies were also taken, either
  imprisoned with their parents, or given to military families. The Abuelas de
  Plaza de Mayo have fought for almost 50 years to find these grandchildren.
  Buscarita Roa is one of two surviving active members. As Argentina’s military
  sank its claws into our country, our young people, the ones with ideas,
  started disappearing. They were taken from the streets, from their homes, from
  work. On 28 November 1978, my 22-year-old son, José, his wife, Marta, and
  their baby daughter, Claudia, joined the list of those “disappeared”. A squad
  of Argentina’s military police stormed their home and I couldn’t find out any
  more. I went everywhere to look for them – police stations, courthouses, army
  camps, churches. I was desperate. But nobody would answer me. Every door was
  closed. It was a suffocating, hermetic time. Then one day, not long after they
  were taken, I watched as a group of women walked in circles around the Plaza
  de Mayo in Buenos Aires. These mothers and grandmothers had started to gather,
  demanding answers about their missing relatives. I recognised one of the
  women. She said come with us, and I did. We – who would become known as the
  Abuelas – didn’t know each other before. But we would meet every week and walk
  round and round the square, identifying each other with our white headscarves.
  At first some of the husbands came, but we knew they risked being
  “disappeared” too, so then the men stayed at home and we went alone. It was
  still dangerous, a terrifying time, and some of the first mothers were taken
  themselves. When the police ordered us to leave, and we didn’t, they charged
  at us on horseback. But we were younger then, so we could run. Together we
  started going to the police stations and the courts, searching for answers. We
  cried in front of them, and they told us to go away, they didn’t want to see
  us. We knew the dictatorship was watching us from afar. My granddaughter’s
  disappearance haunted my life. She was only eight months old when she was
  taken, and whenever I would see a little girl who looked like her, I would
  follow her, unable to stop until I saw her face. If there were people at my
  front door I would think, oh she must have come home. Other times, people
  would tell us they had seen a neighbour with a new baby. So we would go to
  their houses, trying to glimpse the child, to see if they looked like one of
  ours. We were doing crazy, desperate things, but it was all we had. Many years
  passed before we started to receive any information. Most people didn’t
  believe us, and those that did thought our sons were terrorists. Still, we
  continued to go to Plaza de Mayo to pray for the return of our children. And
  when the country’s economic situation improved, we started travelling abroad
  to share our story too. In 2000, I found my granddaughter, and was able to hug
  her again for the first time in two decades. People had come forward with
  their suspicions, and a judge agreed to investigate. We learned that Claudia
  had been taken to the clandestine detention centre “El Olimpo” with her
  mother, where she was kept for three days before being illegally adopted by a
  military family. They created a fake birth certificate, signed by a military
  doctor. My son and daughter-in-law were tortured and killed. Claudia was in my
  heart every day that she was missing. I can’t explain what I felt when I found
  her. It was a pure, overwhelming joy. But I was also afraid, fearful that she
  would reject me. By then she was 21, and had been raised by a military family.
  I couldn’t invade my granddaughter’s life just like that, she needed to figure
  out the terrible truth and start trusting us. Slowly, over long afternoons of
  mate [a traditional herbal drink], we got to know each other and have built a
  beautiful relationship. Belonging to the Abuelas helped me to heal. We
  laughed, we cried and we became friends. We were relentless too – we women
  have not rested once in half a century. But while some of us found our
  grandchildren, others only found bodies, and most of us found nothing at all.
  And then there is the battle of time; it is cruel and many of the Abuelas have
  died. There were once many of us, and now there are fewer than 10. Estela de
  Carlotto, the president of the Abuelas, and I are the two last active members.
  But we are growing old too, and I don’t know how much further life will take
  us. We have found 140 of the grandchildren, with the last reunited last month,
  but we estimate that nearly 300 are still missing. The ones we have found have
  now taken up the mantle. This is the legacy de Carlotto and I leave behind: a
  generation of grandchildren still looking for the others. My lifelong work has
  consisted of searching for my son and daughter-in-law. I am 87 years old now,
  but I will never give up. As told to Harriet Barber
