  Each month has its weather folklore, and according to one old saying: “When it
  rains in August, it rains honey and wine.” Historically, vineyards were not
  irrigated, and some winemakers believe natural rainfall is needed to keep the
  all-important terroir characteristic of a particular area. Irrigation
  increases the grape yield, potentially quadrupling the weight per hectare, but
  supposedly reduces wine quality. Similarly drought years are sometimes said to
  produce the best vintages. So a wet August may significantly increase the
  quantity of wine produced, though arguably at the expense of the quality. In a
  dry year, late rain may keep vines alive and save a threatened grape harvest,
  as happened in Bordeaux in 1995. As for honey, the heavy rainfall typical of
  August thunderstorms is not favourable for bees. Heavy rain can damage
  flowers, and rain may wash nectar away or dilute it. Prolonged rain keeps bees
  in the hive and prevents them from foraging. However, moderate steady rainfall
  improves plant growth and boosts nectar production. Perhaps more importantly,
  August rain can extend the blooming season for some flowers. This gives the
  bees more time to collect nectar and make more honey. Much weather folklore is
  doubtful at best. But the idea that August rainfall increases wine and honey
  output does seem broadly plausible.
