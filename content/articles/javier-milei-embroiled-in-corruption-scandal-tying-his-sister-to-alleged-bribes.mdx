  Argentina’s president Javier Milei is facing his administration’s worst
  alleged corruption scandal – involving none other than his hugely influential
  sister, Karina – less than two months before key legislative elections. For
  more than a week, news in the country has been dominated by audio recordings
  in which a former government official is heard discussing the alleged payment
  of bribes linked to the purchase of medicines for people with disabilities. In
  the recordings, Diego Spagnuolo, the head of the National Disability Agency
  and a former Milei lawyer, claimed that the sister of the self-styled
  anarcho-capitalist allegedly pocketed 3% from each contract. Spagnuolo
  initially denied it was him in the tapes, but later admitted it and was
  dismissed by the government after the furore. After days of silence, Milei
  appeared alongside his sister – an influential figure in his administration –
  at a campaign rally, asking the crowd to give her a “big ovation”. After a
  summer in which the wild-haired president was celebrated even by the British
  right, political analysts in Argentina see the case as the most damaging blow
  yet to Milei. “It’s the biggest scandal his administration has faced,” said
  Juan Courel, an expert in political communication from Alaska Comunicación.
  The scandal first emerged on 19 August, when the streaming channel Carnaval
  released the first audio recordings, the source of which is still unknown. In
  the recordings, Spagnuolo claimed the alleged scheme was channelled through
  the pharmaceutical firm Suizo Argentina, which allegedly demanded 8% kickbacks
  from other companies seeking government contracts. The scheme reportedly
  generated between $500,000 and $800,000 per month in bribes, with 3% of that
  amount allegedly going to Milei’s sister, Karina, who is the secretary general
  of the presidency – a role she was able to assume because Milei scrapped a
  decree barring relatives from public office. Spagnuolo also said he had warned
  the president about the supposed fraudulent dealings: “I said to him: ‘Javier,
  you know they are stealing, that your sister is stealing’.” As the scandal
  spread, lawyer Gregorio Dalbón filed a criminal complaint against Milei,
  Karina, Spagnuolo and others named in the recordings. Dalbón has represented
  former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner – Milei’s main political
  adversary who was herself banned from politics for life and put under house
  arrest in June after the supreme court upheld a six-year sentence for
  corruption. Dalbón described the allegations against Milei’s government as
  “the greatest corruption scandal since democracy was restored in 1983”,
  adding: “I don’t rule out that this could be this government’s Watergate.” A
  federal judge ordered an investigation and police raids at dozens of
  addresses. At the home of one of Suizo Argentina’s owners, $266,000 in cash
  was seized. During a campaign event last Saturday, Karina did not mention the
  case directly, but said: “We are ready to fight, to keep watch so they [the
  opposition] don’t steal from us any more.” The president also avoided
  addressing the case directly, but reposted on his social media a statement
  from Suizo Argentina, in which the company said it was “fully available” to
  the courts to “clarify the facts under investigation, fully convinced it had
  acted in complete compliance with current rules and laws”. Opposition
  lawmakers filed a motion to establish an investigative commission to probe the
  corruption allegations. “So far, there have been no convincing explanations
  about what happened,” said Esteban Paulón, the socialist deputy who introduced
  the bill. “And that is serious because it undermines the government’s
  credibility.” On 26 October, Milei will face his first midterm election, with
  half the seats in the lower house and a third of the senate up for grabs.
  According to Lara Goyburu, a political scientist and executive director at the
  consulting firm Management &amp; Fit, the scandal could affect voter turnout
  and poses a greater risk to Milei than the cryptocurrency debacle. In
  February, the president promoted an obscure token called $LIBRA, which soared
  in value after his endorsement before collapsing, prompting dozens of criminal
  complaints alleging fraud. Goyburu said the “audio scandal” resonates more
  with the public because it occurred “in an organisation that works with a
  vulnerable sector of the population” and because it appears closer to the
  “old-fashioned corruption” Milei had promised to fight.
