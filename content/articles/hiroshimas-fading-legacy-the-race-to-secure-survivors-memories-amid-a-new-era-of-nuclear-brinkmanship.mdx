  The fires were still burning, and the dead lay where they had fallen, when a
  10-year-old Yoshiko Niiyama entered Hiroshima, two days after it was destroyed
  by an American atomic bomb. “I remember that the air was filled with smoke and
  there were bodies everywhere … and it was so hot,” Niiyama says in an
  interview at her home in the Hiroshima suburbs. “The faces of the survivors
  were so badly disfigured that I didn’t want to look at them. But I had to.”
  Niiyama and her eldest sister had rushed to the city to search for their
  father, Mitsugi, who worked in a bank located just 1km from the hypocentre.
  They had been evacuated to a neighbourhood just outside the city, but knew
  something dreadful had happened in Hiroshima when they saw trucks passing
  their temporary home carrying badly burned victims. As Hiroshima prepares to
  mark 80 years since the city was destroyed in the world’s first nuclear
  attack, the 90-year-old is one of a small number of hibakusha – survivors of
  the atomic bombings – still able to recall the horrors they witnessed after
  their home was reduced to rubble in an instant. At 8:15am on 6 August, the
  Enola Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a nuclear bomb on the city. “Little Boy”
  detonated about 600 metres from the ground, with a force equivalent to 15,000
  tonnes of TNT. Between 60,000 and 80,000 people were killed instantly, with
  the death toll rising to 140,000 by the end of the year as victims succumbed
  to burns and illnesses caused by acute exposure to radiation. Three days
  later, the Americans dropped a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki, killing 74,000. And
  on 15 August, a demoralised Japan surrendered, bringing an end to the second
  world war. Niiyama, one of four sisters, never found her father or his
  remains, which were likely incinerated along with those of his colleagues. “My
  father was tall, so for a long time whenever I saw a tall man from behind, I
  would run up to him thinking it might be him,” she says. “But it never was.”
  With the number of people who survived the bombing and witnessed its immediate
  aftermath dwindling by the year, it is being left to younger people to
  continue to communicate the horrors inflicted on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For
  decades Niiyama, who is a registered hibakusha, said nothing of the trauma she
  had suffered as a schoolgirl, not even to members of her own family. “I didn’t
  want to remember what had happened,” she says. “And many hibakusha stayed
  quiet as they knew they might face discrimination, like not being able to
  marry or find a job. There were rumours that children born to hibakusha would
  be deformed.” It was only when her granddaughter, Kyoko Niiyama, then a high
  school student, asked her about her wartime experiences that Niiyama broke her
  silence. “When my children are older, they’ll naturally ask about what
  happened to their grandmother,” says the younger Niiyama, 35, a reporter for a
  local newspaper and the mother of two young children. “It would be such a
  shame if I wasn’t able to tell them … that’s why I decided to ask my
  grandmother about the bomb.” She is one of a growing number of people in
  Hiroshima and Nagasaki studying to become “family successors” – a local
  government initiative that certifies the descendants of first-generation
  hibakusha to record and pass on the experiences of the only people on earth to
  have lived through nuclear warfare. “Now that the anniversary is approaching,
  I can talk to her again,” Kyoko says. “This is a really precious time for our
  family.” ‘I don’t want to think about that day’ Last year, survivors of the
  Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks won recognition for their campaign to rid the
  world of nuclear weapons when Nihon Hidankyo – a nationwide network of
  hibakusha – was awarded the Nobel peace prize. But survivors face a race
  against time to ensure that their message lives on in a world that is edging
  closer to a new age of nuclear brinkmanship. The world’s nine nuclear states
  are spending billions of dollars on modernising, and in some cases expanding,
  their arsenals. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has refused to rule out
  the use of tactical nuclear weapons in his war against Ukraine, and last week
  a veiled nuclear threat by the country’s former leader, Dmitry Medvedev,
  prompted Donald Trump – who had earlier compared US strikes on Iran’s nuclear
  facilities to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks – to claim that he had moved
  two nuclear submarines closer to the region. North Korea’s development of
  nuclear weapons continues unchecked. “The hibakusha have spent their lifetimes
  courageously telling their stories again and again, essentially reliving their
  childhood traumas – to make sure the world learns the reality of what nuclear
  weapons actually do to people and why they must be abolished, so that no one
  else goes through what they have suffered,” says Melissa Parke, executive
  director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “These
  brave hibakusha deserve to have their decades of campaigning vindicated and to
  witness the elimination of nuclear weapons in their lifetimes. This would
  provide some nuclear justice.” The number of registered survivors of both
  attacks fell to just below 100,000 this year, according to the health
  ministry, compared with more than 372,000 in 1981. Their average age is 86.
  Just one of the 78 people confirmed to have been within 500 metres of the
  hypocentre of the blast in Hiroshima is still alive – an 89-year-old man. On
  the eve of the anniversary, the ministry said it would no longer conduct a
  survey every 10 years to assess the living conditions and health of hibakusha,
  saying it wanted to “lessen the burden” on ageing survivors. Niiyama, who
  struggles to walk, will watch Wednesday’s ceremony at home and pause to
  remember her father, whose memory is represented by a teacup he used that was
  retrieved from the devastation. “I don’t like the month of August,” she says.
  “I have nightmares around the anniversary. I don’t want to think about that
  day, but I can’t forget it. But I’m glad I still remember that I’m a
  hibakusha.”
