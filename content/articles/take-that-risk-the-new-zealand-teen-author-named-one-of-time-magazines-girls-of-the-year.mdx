  When New Zealand teenager Rutendo Shadaya was nine years old, she wanted to
  create the perfect birthday present for her best friend – an act of kindness
  that has helped land her on the front of Time magazine. “I was very good with
  gift giving, and I knew she liked reading … so I was like ‘Why don’t I write a
  book for her?’” Shadaya tells the Guardian. Two months later she had her
  fantasy novella, Rachel and the Enchanted Forest, in her hands, and, despite
  having previously “despised” writing, had enjoyed the process so much she
  wanted to push it further. After finding out it was “unrealistic” for a girl
  her age to find a traditional publisher, Shadaya self-published, winning over
  a young local audience and going on to sell hundreds of copies. Shadaya, now
  17, has since published two more books in the series, and has just been named
  one of Time magazine’s girls of the year for featuring strong female leads in
  her work, and for using her platform to lift up other budding writers.
  Shadaya, who was born in New Zealand to Zimbabwean parents and lives in
  Tokoroa, a rural town in the central North Island, does not know how she ended
  up on the magazine’s radar. It was such a surprise, she thought their first
  email was fake and did not immediately respond. “What are the chances they
  would reach out to a 17-year-old in Tokoroa?” She only started feeling the
  scale of the recognition in the lead-up to it becoming public. “It’s surreal,”
  Shadaya says. “I’m being featured with these iconic young women and I feel
  like it’s such a privilege being honoured and [seeing] my hard work paying
  off.” Shadaya is one of 10 girls from around the world to feature in the
  magazine’s new list, and is the only girl representing Oceania. Her series
  traverses themes of adventure, friendship, mental health and perseverance, as
  her protagonist, Rachel, overcomes challenges through pushing herself out of
  her comfort zone, using her magical powers for good and surrounding herself
  with supportive friends. Shadaya wants “young girls to feel empowered when
  they read these books” and says it is “really cool to see people are
  interested”. Since publishing her books, Shadaya has used her platform to
  encourage other young writers, including appearing at community talks and
  events, and more recently running a competition for writers and artists
  between eight and 13 years old, the winners of which will feature in a
  soon-to-be-released book. Shadaya is also a keen netball player, a student
  volunteer, a YWCA young leader and is considering a future in dentistry
  alongside a writing career. Until then, Shadaya hopes her work will inspire
  others around her, particularly young women and girls. “Never let your
  background or age define you,” she says. “You’ll always face a lot of
  challenges but those challenges are built on to your journey … take that risk,
  you won’t regret it in the end.” Time’s girls of the year list – created in
  collaboration with Lego Group – is the magazine’s first list to highlight
  girls’ achievements, and builds on its existing women of the year list. Other
  entrants on the list include 13-year-old Scottish inventor Rebecca Young, the
  Olympic skateboarder Coco Yoshizawa, 15, from Japan, and an organ donation
  advocate, Naomi S DeBerry, 12, from the US. Time senior editor Dayana
  Sarkisova said the girls featured in the list “prove that changing your
  community and inspiring those around you can send ripple effects around the
  globe”. “These girls are part of a generation that’s reshaping what leadership
  looks like today,” she said. “Their generation understands that change doesn’t
  require waiting for adulthood – it starts with seeing problems and refusing to
  accept them as permanent.”
