  Sydney’s huge Gaza protest shows there’s now no stopping the tide of public

  The rain couldn’t stop us. At least 100,000 people took over the CBD and
  marched across Sydney’s Harbour Bridge to protest Israel’s continued genocide
  in Gaza. And it felt like a collective wave of energy, hope and determination
  against institutional and governmental intransigence, denial, obfuscation and
  enabling that has so many of us feeling despairing, disgusted and disquieted.
  Why aren’t they listening? How is this horror continuing unabated with
  impunity? Why won’t Australia impose sanctions and call for arms embargos
  against Israel’s senseless murder of civilians, unleashed by some of the most
  methodical and lethal autonomous weaponry on Earth and AI machines directing
  bombs, as claimed by intelligence sources? As doctors, aid workers and social
  media feeds document the livestreamed ruins of cities, we watch the killing of
  children, people killed in tents while sleeping, starving people fired upon
  and killed at aid stations, forced by their hunger to play Russian roulette
  with their lives. Sixty thousand human souls, around half of them women and
  children, dead and tens of thousands more maimed, injured without mercy or
  relief. Twenty one months of a nightmare for Palestinians that beggars belief.
  A year of protests on Sundays at Hyde Park fountain feels like secular church
  to me, group therapy where I meet with my Readers Against Genocide group,
  listen to Palestinian leaders and collectively bang pots, grieve and wonder
  why some weeks the protests feel smaller than others. We lament colleagues
  doxed, fired, threatened, stripped of funding, forced to resign. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email As Israel breaks new records in the number of journalists
  killed – at least 225 Palestinian journalist witness bearers, according to the
  Palestinian Journalists Syndicate – we try to brace ourselves against a
  growing climate of fear and intimidation prevailing in Australian arts, media
  and academia, where Orwellian tone policing codes dominate. It’s not the
  killing, but speaking out and protesting against these violations, and the
  manner it is done, that is absurdly surveilled and seen as a source of harm
  and violence, and is met with censure and punishment. Sunday felt different.
  The whole city turned up, not just students and activists, but middle class
  grandmothers and parents with prams. What was most striking were the children.
  Parents with toddlers astride their shoulders, holding little ones gently by
  the hand as they stood patiently in raincoats in the crowds, or cradling their
  small sleeping heads on their shoulders, holding signs, all saying the same
  thing: killing and starving children, children just like ours, is wrong and we
  do not consent. We do not consent to New South Wales premier Chris Minns’
  beefed up protest laws that presaged former Greens candidate Hannah Thomas
  allegedly being punched in the face, leaving her at one stage at risk of being
  blinded in one eye. We do not consent to a vast population being killed by
  starvation and malnourishment as Israel deliberately blocks plentiful supplies
  of life-saving food and aid. For the first time in two years, I felt like I
  was in the majority. It also gave the majority a picture of what these
  maligned and villainised protests really are: peaceful, powerful, loving
  declarations of freedom and democracy in action. As police helicopters buzzed
  overhead, and police text messages and speaker phones blasted messages that
  the bridge opening to the north was now blocked and to go back, it felt like a
  divide was both breached and dissolved. In a city of wealth divided –
  geographic, cultural and economic – where your postcode can determine your
  future, it felt like there was no more wealthy, white east, ethnic west, Shire
  south or privileged north. There was just a collective us. Emboldened and
  peaceful crowds kept calm through the confusion, moving with strength and
  power like a colourful cloud of umbrellas over this harbour city. There was no
  stopping this tide, and it’s a message that our governments, media and arts
  leaders need to take heed of: they can no longer isolate and censure the
  dissenting voices in their ranks, because behind them swell millions. • Sarah
