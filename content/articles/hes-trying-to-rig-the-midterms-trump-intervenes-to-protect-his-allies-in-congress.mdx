  They are more than a year away – a lifetime in today’s fast and furious
  political cycle. But one man is already paying attention, pulling the levers
  of power and trying to tip the scales of the 2026 midterm elections. Donald
  Trump has made clear that he is willing to bring the full weight of the White
  House to bear to prevent his Republican party losing control of the US
  Congress in the midterm elections next year, orchestrating a more direct and
  legally dubious intervention than any of his predecessors. The US president’s
  multipronged approach includes redrawing congressional district maps, seeking
  to purge voter rolls, taking aim at mail-in voting and voting machines, and
  ordering the justice department to investigate Democrats’ prime fundraising
  tool. “Nobody’s ever tried to do this,” said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow
  in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington.
  “Most American presidents, Democratic or Republican, have basically played by
  the same rules and been careful of the constitution. But in his business
  career Trump never cared about whether he was doing something legal or not; he
  just went to court and same thing here.” Campaigning, not governing, has often
  been Trump’s comfort zone. He is constitutionally barred from running for
  president again but already has an eye on the November 2026 elections that
  will determine control of the House of Representatives and Senate. He senses
  that law and order, a populist cause long exploited by Republicans, could play
  to his advantage. Earlier this month Trump deployed the national guard to
  reduce crime in Washington DC and threatened similar federal interventions in
  other big cities. Fifty-three per cent of the public approve of how he is
  handling crime, according to an AP-NORC poll, higher than other issues. Trump
  told a cabinet meeting this week: “I think crime will be the big subject of
  the midterms and will be the big subject of the next election. I think it’s
  going to be a big, big subject for the midterms and I think the Republicans
  are going to do really well.” But this is no ordinary campaign. Trump said at
  the same marathon meeting: “I have the right to do anything I want to do. I’m
  the president of the United States.” Taking a familiar political manoeuvre to
  new extremes, he has pushed Republican state legislators in Texas to redraw
  their congressional map because he claims “we are entitled to five more
  seats”, and he is lobbying other red states, including Indiana and Missouri,
  to take similar steps to pad the margin even more. Other steps involve the
  direct use of official presidential power in ways that have no modern
  precedent. He ordered his justice department to investigate ActBlue, an online
  portal that raised hundreds of millions of dollars in small-dollar donations
  for Democratic candidates over two decades. The site has been so successful
  that Republicans launched a similar venture, called WinRed. But Trump did not
  order a federal investigation into WinRed. Trump’s appointees at the justice
  department have also demanded voting data from at least 19 states in an
  apparent attempt to look for ineligible voters. Earlier this year he signed an
  executive order seeking documented proof of citizenship to register to vote,
  among other changes, though much of it has been blocked by courts. Last week
  the president announced that lawyers were drafting an executive order to end
  mail-in balloting, a method used by nearly one in three Americans, and
  threatened to do away with voting machines. He claimed that the Russian
  president, Vladimir Putin, told him mail-in voting was responsible for his
  2020 election loss. There is nothing remarkable about a sitting president
  campaigning for his party in the midterms and trying to bolster incumbents by
  steering projects and support to their districts. But Trump’s actions
  constitute a unique attempt to interfere in a critical election before it is
  even held, raising alarms about the future of democracy. Allan Lichtman, a
  distinguished history professor at American University in Washington, said:
  “We’re seeing a new concerted assault on free and fair elections, harkening
  back to the discredited efforts of the white supremacists in the Jim Crow
  south. He’s trying to rig the midterms and then of course beyond that the next
  presidential election in his political favour.” Trump previously attempted to
  overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which culminated in an
  insurrection by his supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. On that
  occasion, he was constrained by elected Republicans such as his then
  vice-president, Mike Pence, and the Georgia secretary of state, Brad
  Raffensperger. This time he has locked down near-total loyalty from the party
  and assembled a cabinet that again this week offered an ostentatious display
  of fealty. His power grab will not go entirely unchallenged. Gavin Newsom, the
  governor of California, signed legislation that will allow voters to decide in
  November on a redrawn congressional map designed to help Democrats win five
  more House seats next year, neutralising Republicans’ gerrymandering in Texas.
  But Democrats, activists and lawyers will have to find others ways to “fight
  fire with fire” when it comes to Trump’s more extreme meddling. Lichtman,
  author of a new book, Conservative at the Core, added: “Republicans have no
  principles; Democrats have no spine. Democrats need to grow a spine. They need
  to stop playing not to lose – that’s a sure way to lose. They need to respond
  to these outrages powerfully and aggressively by whatever means are possible
  or we’re going to lose our democracy.” Yet while Trump’s gambit is a flex of
  executive power, it could also be seen as an admission of potential weakness.
  The incumbent president’s party typically loses seats in midterm elections. In
  2018, Democrats won enough to take back the House, stymieing Trump’s agenda
  and leading to his impeachment. Only 37% of voters approve of the way Trump is
  handling his job as president, according to a Quinnipiac University national
  poll released on Wednesday, while 55% disapprove. House Republicans, who
  currently have just a three-seat margin, have faced a series of raucous town
  halls that bode ill for their fortunes. Wendy Schiller, a political science
  professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “President
  Trump and the Republicans would not be trying to stack the deck if they didn’t
  think they were going to lose the hand. They are looking at poll numbers and
  they know midterms are bad to incumbent presidents over the last 60 years and
  it’s a very slim margin in the House. “In order for Trump to sustain the
  loyalty of the House – he’s already gotten everything he pretty much wants –
  he needs them to think he’s on their side so he’s going to go out and be very
  public about rigging the voting system to keep them in power.” But Schiller
  added: “Will that be enough to overcome general unhappiness at the moment that
  the voters seem to have with the economy, inflation, even Trump’s border
  policies? It’s not enough to keep the Republicans in line. You have to get
  independent voters to vote for you again and that’s at risk for the
  Republicans right now.”
