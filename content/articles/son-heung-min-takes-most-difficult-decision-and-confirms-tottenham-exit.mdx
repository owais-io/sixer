  Son Heung-min has confirmed he has taken the “most difficult decision” to
  leave Tottenham during this summer’s transfer window after 10 years at the
  club. The 33-year-old made the announcement during Spurs’ pre-season tour of
  Asia, where he was speaking at a press conference in Seoul in his native South
  Korea. “Before we start the press conference I wanted to say I have decided to
  leave the club this summer,” Son said as he sat beside Tottenham’s new
  manager, Thomas Frank. “Respectfully, the club is helping me with this
  decision. “It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career. Such
  amazing memories. It was so hard to make the decision. “I need a new
  environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change – 10 years is a long
  time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years old, such a young age. I leave
  this club as a grown man, a very proud man.” Frank had indicated in July that
  the forward may be on his way out of Spurs and refused to confirm whether Son
  would remain as club captain for the new season. “If a player has been at a
  club a long time, then there will always be a decision for the club to take,”
  Frank said before Tottenham’s first pre-season fixture against Reading on 19
  July. Son has been at Tottenham since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in the
  summer of 2015, going on to score 173 goals in 454 appearances in all
  competitions. He registered just seven goals in the Premier League last
  season, when Spurs finished 17th, before lifting the Europa League – the first
  piece of club silverware of his career – after the victory against Manchester
  United in May’s final in Bilbao. “Winning a title in Europe felt like I had
  achieved everything I possibly could,” Son added. “I spent a lot of time
  reflecting on whether I wanted to experience football in a different
  environment, and I had those conversations with myself over and over again.”
  Los Angeles FC are interested in bringing Son to MLS and have been tracking
  the forward for some time but have yet to make an official bid. They signed
  Hugo Lloris, another Spurs captain, in December 2023. There is not yet thought
  to be any interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia. Son came on as a substitute in
  Tottenham’s friendly win against Arsenal in Hong Kong on Thursday and has
  featured in three of the club’s four pre-season matches this summer. Frank’s
  side are due to face Newcastle in Seoul on Sunday, when Son is expected to
  play and captain Spurs in what could be his final appearance for the club.
  “For me, personally, I would have loved to have worked with this fantastic
  person and player,” Frank said during Saturday’s press conference. “He is a
  true Spurs legend in every aspect, one of the greatest players to play in the
  Premier League. “It is never easy to find the perfect timing and me coming in
  from the side, it makes it a bit easier to end on a high.” Son will leave
  Tottenham with just one trophy, that Europa League triumph under Ange
  Postecoglou, but also with a host of individual awards, most notably the
  Premier League’s golden boot, which he shared with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah
  in the 2021-22 season. He won Fifa’s Puskás award in 2020 for a solo run and
  finish against Burnley. Despite the presence of Harry Kane, Son won
  Tottenham’s player of the year three times in the space of four years between
  2019 and 2022. He will leave fifth on the club’s all-time list of goal scorers
  behind Kane, Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Smith and Martin Chivers.
