  Mike Joyce, drummer for the Smiths, has announced the publication of his
  “no-holds-barred” autobiography, The Drums. A description by the publisher
  said: “The written history of the Smiths is not missing an encyclopaedic
  account of everything that happened over the years; but Mike’s honest,
  entertaining and deeply human memoir is what Smiths fans have been waiting
  for. This book truly conveys what it felt like to be a member of the Smiths.”
  The Drums follows Morrissey’s memoir, Autobiography, released in 2013, and
  guitarist Johnny Marr’s Set the Boy Free in 2016. Bassist Andy Rourke died of
  pancreatic cancer in 2023 without writing a memoir. Fans of the band will be
  hoping for insight into the 1996 high court case in which Joyce and Rourke
  sued Morrissey and Marr over earnings: the frontman and guitarist took 40% of
  the royalties each, leaving 10% apiece for Joyce and Rourke. The rhythm
  section argued that they had been treated like session musicians despite being
  equal partners in the band. The court found in favour of Joyce, who received
  £1m in back royalties and a 25% share going forward, with the judge famously
  labelling Morrissey “truculent and unreliable”. There remains next to no
  chance of the Smiths re-forming. Marr has said he turned down an
  “eye-watering” fee to re-form: “It was a little bit about principles, but I’m
  not an idiot, I just think the vibe’s not right,” he said, a reference to the
  differences between him and Morrissey. Joyce has said that without Rourke, a
  reunion would be “impossible”. Joyce has recently been performing with Pete
  Doherty’s solo band. The Drums will be published on 6 November by New Modern,
  an imprint of HMV owner Doug Putman’s new Putman Publishing house.
