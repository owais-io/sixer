  A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit off Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula early
  on Wednesday and has triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific, with the
  first waves hitting Hawaii. Tsunami waves were also felt in Russia and Japan,
  where evacuations have taken place, and Alaska. Warnings have been issued for
  North and Central America and Pacific islands south toward New Zealand. We
  would like to hear from residents, workers and tourists who have been affected
  by the tsunami or the earthquake. Have you evacuated? Please note that while
  we’d like to hear from you, your security is most important. We recognise it
  may not always be safe or appropriate to record or share your experiences – so
  please think about this when considering whether to get in touch with the
  Guardian.
