  Keir Starmer’s government has continued to diverge from EU environmental laws
  since the Labour party won the 2024 general election, meaning the UK’s
  environmental protections are weaker than before Brexit. From putting rare
  species at risk by ditching the habitats directive to failing to keep up with
  chemicals regulations that keep people and wildlife safe, here are some of the
  areas in which the UK has fallen behind. Protecting rare creatures When the UK
  was in the EU, it was under the habitats directive, which meant developers
  were not allowed to negatively affect the habitats of rare creatures such as
  nightingales, dormice and red squirrels without mitigation on the same site.
  Labour is ripping this up with its planning and infrastructure bill, which
  allows developers to pay into a general nature fund rather than keeping or
  creating new habitat nearby to make up for what is destroyed. Water policy The
  UK has failed to put into practice new, stronger obligations the EU has levied
  on water companies and municipal areas to keep sewage, chemicals and other
  pollution out of rivers and seas. The main divergence is with the 2024 urban
  wastewater treatment directive that the EU has introduced. This applies
  stricter treatment standards to water in urban areas, including the removal of
  micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and microplastics. There are also
  rules the UK still officially falls under, such as the water framework
  directive, which asks all EU member states to clean up their rivers by a
  certain point. However, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) has
  found England is falling behind, and is unlikely to meet targets. It has said
  England will miss them by a “considerable” margin. Its main target under
  regulations related to the water framework directive is to bring 77% of
  surface water bodies into good ecological status by 2027. In reality, this
  figure could be as low as 21%. In light of these findings, the OEP has
  launched an investigation into possible failures of the Department for
  Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency to comply with
  the water framework directive. Without the threat of punishment from the EU,
  there are few consequences for ignoring the directive. Clean air The EU
  recently made a change to the ambient air quality directive, which tightens
  air quality standards and which the UK has not followed suit on. Under this,
  there are much lower thresholds for safe levels of particulates, which can
  cause lung cancer and various other diseases. The EU has also made changes to
  the industrial emissions directive, ozone depleting substances and fluorinated
  gases (F-gases), which the UK has not kept pace with either. Under the
  national emissions ceiling regulations, the UK government under the
  Conservatives decided to regress from legislation as it was set at the point
  of Brexit. As a result of all these decisions, air quality regulations are
  significantly tighter in the EU than in the UK. Climate policy While UK
  emissions have fallen faster than in many parts of the EU, this is mostly from
  decarbonising the power supply, most notably phasing out coal. The next stage
  will be more difficult for the country, as it decarbonises the heating,
  transport, and land use and agriculture sectors. Though the UK and EU share
  broad goals such as the net zero 2050 target, the EU has set legally binding
  targets in areas including energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy
  performance of buildings, while the UK has not. The EU’s revised 2024 methane
  regulation requires the fossil gas, oil and coal sectors to measure, monitor,
  report and verify their methane emissions, and take action to reduce them. It
  also progressively implements stricter requirements on imported fossil fuels
  with the ambition that they will eventually be subject to the same monitoring,
  reporting and verification as providers inside the EU. The UK has not done
  this. Chemicals The EU has banned 13 dangerous chemicals since Brexit. The UK
  has not banned any, according to research by the Chem Trust. This is because
  the UK has replicated the EU’s chemicals regulator Reach, and the UK version
  is considered by experts to be underfunded and inadequate, meaning it takes
  longer to test and ban chemicals. The EU has added 41 chemicals to its
  watchlist, which means they may be banned soon subject to further analysis,
  while the UK has added zero. Banned chemicals include lead gunshot in wetland,
  intentionally added microplastics, and “forever chemicals” in firefighting
  foams. The UK promised a new UK chemicals strategy in 2018, but has still not
  released one. Other directives the EU has recently strengthened in relation to
  chemicals include the classification, labelling and packaging regulation,
  ecodesign framework, urban wastewater treatment directive and industrial
  emissions directive. Deforestation The UK was supposed to remove products such
  as cocoa, soy and palm oil from areas with illegal deforestation after the
  Environment Act was passed in 2021. However, this has still not happened. The
  EU, meanwhile, has implemented its deforestation-free products regulation,
  which is more ambitious than the UK equivalent, as it tackles not just illegal
  deforestation but all deforestation in sensitive areas for seven key products.
  Circular economy Experts say it is critical that people stop wasting so many
  consumer products, and have pushed for a transition to a circular economy.
  This means that as much is recycled, and as little wasted, as possible. The EU
  has legislated in a wide range of areas – critical raw materials, batteries,
  textiles and food waste, product liability, repair of goods, and ecodesign
  among others. There are fears the UK will become a dumping ground for products
  not designed to the EU’s new ecodesign standards, which stipulate their
  recyclability and energy efficiency. This is because they will not be allowed
  to be sold in the EU, but can be in the UK. Marine policy This is one area in
  which the UK has diverged positively. English North Sea waters and all
  Scottish waters were recently closed for sandeel fishing, which is crucial for
  seabirds such as puffins as these little eels make up most of their food
  source. This was contested by the EU, which took the UK to court, but the ban
  was upheld. The UK has also developed more marine protected areas since Brexit
  than the EU. However, there has so far been a lack of implementation and
  enforcement of fishing bans, leading campaigners to label these “paper parks”.
  Pesticides There has been a divergence in pesticide standards, with the EU
  having banned more and the UK not following suit. The UK has weakened
  pesticide maximum residue levels on a number of substances allowed on or in
  food of both animal and non-animal origin (ie plants) to below where they were
  at the point of Brexit. However, the government indicated that after the UK-EU
  reset talks this spring, there would be an alignment on pesticides. Details on
  this have yet to be released. The UK has also closed the gap on bee-killing
  neonicotinoids, which were banned in the EU but continued to be used in the UK
  for the four years after Brexit until this year, when they were finally
  removed from use. Agriculture After leaving the EU, the UK left the common
  agricultural policy, which was the method the EU used to subsidise farmers.
  Rather than paying farmers per hectare they managed, the UK government decided
  to pay them for delivering “public goods” such as restoring nature by creating
  habitats for rare creatures. However, the policy has stopped and started, and
  all UK farmers have had to contend with significantly less certainty over
  future payments than their EU counterparts. CAP budgets are planned in
  seven-year cycles, while the UK’s is subject to surprise cuts. The government
  recently announced the budget for farmers would be cut by an average of £100m
  a year until 2029. This lack of certainty and funding could hinder the
  environmental improvements these new schemes are intended to bring about.
  Invasive species The UK is far behind the EU on listing invasive species of
  special concern. The UK has listed 66, but the EU will soon have listed more
  than 100. This is partly because there are more pathways for entry into the
  EU, but the true number of invasive species is likely to be higher, and these
  pose a great threat to native wildlife as well as food production. The UK has
  not added any invasive species of special concern to its list since Brexit, as
  environmental regulation has stalled.
