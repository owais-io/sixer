  One of Graham Platner’s high school yearbooks shows him babyfaced with a
  buzzcut, holding a sign proclaiming, in part: “Free Palestine.” The image is
  accompanied by a superlative his classmates bestowed upon him: “Most Likely To
  Start A Revolution.” “Well see!” Platner wrote on X Thursday, posting a photo
  of the yearbook page, in a post that’s been viewed 4.5m times. Now bearded,
  burly and tattooed, with a sweep of dirty blond hair above a sunburnt face,
  Platner still believes in a free Palestine. He also thinks it’ll take
  something revolutionary to save the US, so earlier this week, when the
  oysterman announced his candidacy to be the next US senator from Maine, he
  pulled no punches. “I did four infantry tours in the Marine Corps and the
  army. I’m not afraid to name an enemy, and the enemy is the oligarchy. It’s
  the billionaires who pay for it, the politicians who sell us out,” he said in
  a campaign launch video, showing him chopping wood and at the helm of a small
  fishing boat. “And yeah, that means politicians like Susan Collins. I’m not
  fooled by this fake charade of Collins’ deliberations and moderation.”
  Platner’s video went viral, his message punching through in a crowded field of
  Democratic primary candidates, all vying for the chance to defeat Collins.
  Despite her protestations of being a “moderate”, Collins, a 72-year-old
  Republican senator, has often aligned herself with Donald Trump’s far-right
  agenda. Democrats thought they had a real shot to unseat Collins in 2020. Sara
  Gideon raised $40m more than Collins, and polls showed Gideon in the lead, but
  she still lost by nine points in a state her fellow Democrat, Joe Biden, won
  handily. Now, the Democratic party is trying again, seeing Collins’s seat as
  crucial to their chances of taking back the US Senate in 2026. Establishment
  Democrats have eyed Maine governor Janet Mills as a potential candidate, but
  Mills has yet to jump into the race. Platner believes the party needs an
  outsider. He believes that pedigreed, establishment Democratic candidates have
  failed repeatedly to appeal to working-class Americans, hastening the rise of
  Maga. “Most Trump supporters I know think that the system is screwing them,”
  Platner says. “They think it is not working on their behalf. They think that
  they are being robbed by the ultra-wealthy. And these are all true statements.
  When I talk to them about these things, we are all in full agreement. And in
  many ways, this is at the core of why we are in the straits that we are in.
  The Democratic party has in many ways lost those people, not all of them, but
  some over the years, by not being clearly a party of the working class,
  representing the interests of the working class.” Platner’s populist brand of
  politics grew, in part, out of his experience in the military. He enlisted in
  the Marine Corps after high school and deployed to Iraq three times. When he
  returned home, he went to George Washington University on the GI bill, before
  deciding to enlist again, this time with the army national guard. He was
  deployed to Afghanistan. “I witnessed the just horrific human cost of those
  wars,” he says. “Both for the young American men and women who were deployed,
  but also the people in the countries that we invaded.” He grew disillusioned,
  eventually realizing that the US’s “military adventurism” was “a mechanism of
  moving taxpayer dollars into the private bank accounts of defense companies,
  all on the backs of frankly working-class men and women, and on the backs of
  the people living in societies that we took the wars to”. Platner went from
  Afghanistan back home to Sullivan, Maine, taking a job on an oyster farm –
  across Frenchman Bay from Acadia national park – which he now runs. He got
  married and seemed to be settling down for a quiet life, but says he saw his
  friends and neighbors struggle with rising healthcare costs, shuttered
  hospitals and housing prices that forced many to move away. “This isn’t a
  vanity project,” Platner says of his Senate campaign. If anything, he says,
  the campaign has thrown his life into “a bit of disarray”. He’s doing it
  because he cares about the community that has cared for him and believes in a
  type of politics that may have appeal across the political spectrum – one he
  believes has the ability to stop the rising tide of fascism in the US.
  “Government can provide good things for people like I have been provided – a
  good life by the support I get from the VA [Department of Veterans Affairs],
  both in healthcare and in housing, and I don’t think that people should have
  to go fight in foreign wars to get those things. I think they should get those
  things just by being an American,” he says. His policy proposals – Medicare
  for all, the return of “serious federal support for building housing” and a
  “billionaire minimum tax”, among others – may not sound too dissimilar from
  the platforms of progressive Democrats like Bernie Sanders. But Platner is
  wary of labels, eschewing words like “liberal” or “leftie”. It’s not only
  because he doesn’t present like your stereotypical progressive – he’s a
  veteran, an oysterman and a competitive shooter, spending his weekends at the
  local gunnery. He doesn’t like political labels, he says, because “we have far
  more in common with our neighbors than we do with anyone who’s up in the
  stratospherically wealthy elite … By trying to force people into these little
  holes, that keeps folks divided, and I don’t think there’s any value in that.”
  Similarly, Platner sees “culture war” issues as distractions. His campaign
  platform – unlike a lot of establishment Democrats – is unequivocal in its
  support of marginalized groups. On immigrants, he’s called out the government
  for “kidnapping people off the streets and imprisoning them in hellish
  conditions” and says he “will support a path to citizenship and an end to the
  mass deportation machine”. On queer people, his website states he’s tired of
  “politicians using small groups of people as a punching bag – be it race, or
  gender identity, or sexual orientation”. “I will support passing, at last,
  federal LGBTQ anti-discrimination legislation,” it says. As he surveys the
  American political scene, Platner is enraged by a Democratic party he sees as
  more interested in raising money than helping people, a party willing to
  appease Maga, to meet it in the middle, instead of fighting it. “Nothing
  pisses me off more than getting a fundraising text from Democrats talking
  about how they’re fighting fascism…,” he tweeted on Wednesday. “Because it’s
  such bullshit. We’re not idiots. Everyone knows most of them aren’t doing jack
  shit right now to fight back. People are being kidnapped into unmarked vans by
  masked police. There is a genocide happening in Palestine. Literal
  billionaires have taken over our government. And all Democratic leadership can
  do is send us another fundraising text?” For now, Platner is an oysterman and
  harbormaster in Sullivan, diving into the water to moor boats so they don’t
  float out to sea in a storm, but he believes his next job will be in
  Washington DC. “We need to give people hope,” he says. “We need to show them
  that there still is an element in American politics that wants to fight on
  their behalf and comes from them. That’s not something that comes from on
  high. We need to build the concept of working-class politics again, and I
  think that is very much the mechanism of how we move forward.”
