  mile’

  Success breeds expectation as Lewis Hamilton, who has enjoyed both like few
  other drivers in Formula One, knows only too well. Having set himself the task
  of returning a title for Ferrari, anticipation for his first season with the
  team was off the scale but success has been far from forthcoming. As the
  Scuderia have struggled the seven-time champion has been drawing on every bit
  of experience in what may be the defining challenge of his storied career. At
  the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend Ferrari announced they were extending
  their contract with team principal, Fred Vasseur, backing the Frenchman who
  was instrumental in bringing Hamilton on board to complete his mission of
  reforging Ferrari into a championship-winning outfit after underachieving for
  so long. However as the season approaches its summer break, with 10 races to
  come after Budapest and Ferrari winless, Vasseur still has much to achieve.
  Hamilton has been outspoken in his support for Vasseur since he made the
  switch after 12 years with Mercedes but, during a season of acclimatisation
  and adaptation to a new team, the British driver has appreciated that he must
  do more than drive. Rather it seems, as Michael Schumacher managed to such
  great success with Ferrari, to take a leadership role. It is believed Hamilton
  was somewhat taken aback at the team’s organisation and methodologies when he
  began working with them and that he felt the decision making process was
  ungainly. He has repeatedly stressed he is convinced they have the talent in
  personnel to succeed but it has become clear he thinks they must be utilised
  better. At Belgium last week he was unusually candid in revealing he had held
  a series of meetings with the key players at Ferrari: Vasseur, the chair John
  Elkann and the chief executive, Benedetto Vigna. Moreover he had gone as far
  as compiling two documents detailing suggestions for the progress he believes
  is needed to turn around Ferrari’s fortunes, an admission that caused no
  little stir. One of said submissions was about the car, where he thought it
  could be improved and more crucially where they might take it under the new
  regulations next year. This might be considered the due diligence of any
  committed, ambitious and thoughtful driver. However of more significance was
  the second aimed at the operational approach at Ferrari, the “structural
  adjustments” he believed were required. “It is a huge organisation and there’s
  a lot of moving parts, and not all of them are firing on all the cylinders
  that [they] need to be,” he said. “That’s ultimately why the team’s not had
  the success that I think it deserves. So I feel that it’s my job to challenge
  absolutely every area, to challenge everybody in the team, particularly the
  guys that are at the top who are making the decisions.” For the 40-year-old
  Hamilton there is urgency to this task. Ferrari is surely his last shot at
  claiming a record-breaking eighth title that would end the team’s drought
  stretching back to 2007 for a drivers’ championship and 2008 for a
  constructors’. He is more than aware that since then the Scuderia has come
  close but still failed to deliver even with former world champions Fernando
  Alonso and then Sebastian Vettel at the wheel. Over 11 seasons between 2010
  and 2020, there were many wins for Alonso and Vettel but still ultimately the
  team could not seal a championship. Hamilton’s actions and attitude reveal a
  determination that if he too is to fall short it will not be through a lack of
  effort on his behalf. “I refuse for that to be the case with me, so I’m going
  the extra mile,” he said. “I’ve obviously been very fortunate to have had
  experiences in two other great teams. And while things for sure are going to
  be different, because there’s a different culture and everything, I think
  sometimes if you take the same path all the time, you get the same results. So
  I’m just challenging certain things.” That the best use of the human resource
  in F1 can be gamechanging could not be better illustrated than with the
  extraordinary resurgence Andrea Stella has wrought at McLaren in just over two
  years. Moreover there are also indications that internally Hamilton is already
  making a difference. “The response has been amazing to the steps that we’ve
  taken in all areas,” he said in Hungary. “The passion and the desire to
  continue to do better is what’s the most amazing thing.” On track there is a
  sense that for all that Hamilton has struggled with the car this year, without
  a podium for 13 races, the longest period of his career, he remains as sharp
  as ever. His recent drives at Silverstone and Spa were proof enough of that
  and his call to switch to slick tyres in Belgium evidence that his instincts
  remain finely honed. Hamilton is then putting the building blocks in place,
  confident that if the team can deliver he will too, having already done the
  hard yards behind the scenes this season. In first practice at the Hungaroring
  Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc continued to work with the new rear
  suspension Ferrari brought to Spa and which they hope will develop into a
  serious improvement for the car. They finished fifth and third respectively in
  a session which was once more dominated by the McLarens of championship
  contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. In the second session McLaren were
  once more on top, with Norris again leading Piastri by two-tenths. Leclerc was
  third and Hamilton sixth, with Max Verstappen in 14th, very much struggling
  with the balance of his ride. The Dutchman’s difficult afternoon was further
  compounded as he was investigated for throwing a towel, left in error in his
  car, from the cockpit while on track and issued with a warning for an unsafe
  release. Norris on Friday looked to ease the pressure on the title race,
  saying that it does not matter if he fails to beat Piastri to the world
  championship because “in 200 years we will all be dead”. Asked if he needs to
  get under the Australian’s skin to land his maiden F1 title, Norris replied:
  “I don’t enjoy that. In 200 years no one is going to care. We’ll all be dead.
  I am trying to have a good time. I still care about it, and that’s why I get
  upset sometimes and I get disappointed and angry at myself. And I think that
  shows just how much I care about winning and losing. “But that doesn’t mean I
  need to take it out on Oscar. I just don’t get into those kind of things.”
