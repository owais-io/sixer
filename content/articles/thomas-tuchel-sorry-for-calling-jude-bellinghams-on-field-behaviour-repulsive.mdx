  Thomas Tuchel has apologised for upsetting Jude Bellingham with his
  “repulsive” comment at the end of last season as he reflected on the surprise
  exclusion of Trent Alexander-Arnold from his England squad – and the awkward
  phone-call that went with it. The head coach has given first call-ups to
  Elliot Anderson and Djed Spence for the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra
  at Villa Park and Serbia in Belgrade while there were recalls for John Stones,
  Marc Guéhi, Tino Livramento, Adam Wharton, Marcus Rashford and Jarrod Bowen.
  However, plenty of the focus was on players who will not be involved and that
  started with Bellingham, who is ruled out as he recovers from shoulder
  surgery, and his Real Madrid teammate Alexander-Arnold. Tuchel has also
  dropped Kyle Walker and Curtis Jones and there was no room for Jack Grealish.
  Tuchel was keen to draw a line under the Bellingham episode, which erupted
  when he discussed the midfielder’s “edge” in a live interview with TalkSport,
  one that can make the player blow up during matches and come across in a way
  that “can be a bit repulsive”. Tuchel admitted his mother sometimes had mixed
  emotions when watching Bellingham play. What Tuchel most wanted to stress was
  that his choice of word in his second language had been poor and he was sorry.
  “I used this word unintentionally,” he said. “There was no message, no hidden
  agenda. I fully understand that it’s my responsibility, that I created the
  headlines and I’m sorry for the upset. I should have known better. I should
  have done better. If someone makes the effort to listen to the whole answer he
  would clearly understand the appreciation that I have for the player. “When I
  was aware of the headlines, I made contact straight away [with Bellingham].
  Jude focuses now on his rehabilitation and we focus on Andorra and Serbia. Is
  it sorted? I hope so. It was in English so I don’t think my mum was fully
  aware of it. She had the right to be annoyed at me.” Tuchel described
  Alexander-Arnold as a player who “needs to feel trust and love from his
  manager and teammates, from his club, his country, the fans”. He made the
  point that the right-back had a lot going on when he called him up for the
  first time in June for the away game in Andorra and the friendly against
  Senegal at the City Ground. He would give him minutes only against Andorra –
  as a 64th-minute substitute. Alexander-Arnold had just signed for Real Madrid,
  he was preparing for his unveiling straight after the camp when he would speak
  in fluent Spanish and then it was off to the Club World Cup. Yet Tuchel also
  made it plain that the decision to drop Alexander-Arnold was based on merit,
  with Reece James and Livramento in better form. He also suggested that another
  right-back, Ben White, might have been selected if he had not been injured,
  thereby ending a lengthy international exile. “I spoke to Trent, it was a
  difficult phone call but I wanted that he hears it from me, which he
  appreciated,” Tuchel said. “He was very clear that he’s desperate to come back
  and play for England. It is a competitive decision, first and foremost.”
  Tuchel reserves the right to adopt different approaches with different
  players, which he appears to have done with Myles Lewis-Skelly. The
  18-year-old left-back has been retained in the squad, despite having lost his
  starting place at Arsenal to Riccardo Calafiori this season. “When I called
  Myles up [last season], we had a long discussion and it was almost in a
  parental atmosphere – like, can we really accelerate his career onto
  international level,” Tuchel said. “Now we see that it is not so easy to keep
  the momentum for Myles, which is totally understandable. “We were a part of
  his acceleration and I was so happy when we did it. But now it comes with a
  responsibility from us to not drop him on the first occasion just because he
  does not start. It is a fine line.” Tuchel’s tenure has featured three wins
  out of three in qualifying and the loss against Senegal. His football has
  generally failed to quicken the pulse, which he attributes in part to him
  calling up a large number of players and the difficulty in building any rhythm
  across the March and June get-togethers, the latter being especially tough in
  terms of timing. The fixtures will come thicker and faster in the autumn and
  Tuchel, having picked a leaner 24-man squad, is determined to instil clearer
  patterns and identity – and to see a spirit of collective sacrifice. “The
  players need to drop their club hats, the way they play in their clubs and buy
  into our ideas,” Tuchel said. “We will see them. I’m very sure of that because
  they will be very clear.”
