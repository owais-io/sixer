  Yorùbá Boy Running by Biyi Bándélé audiobook review – from enslaved teenager
  to celebrated preacher

bodyText: >-
  Set in 19th-century Òsogùn in what is now Nigeria, Yorùbá Boy Running opens
  with 13-year-old Àjàyí reporting a premonition to his mother about dark days
  ahead. A week later, the town is surrounded by Malian slave raiders and Àjàyí
  is kidnapped along with his mother, sister, best friend and neighbours. He is
  taken to Lagos and sold to Portuguese slavers preparing to ship their human
  cargo to the Americas. But they are intercepted by the British navy, which
  releases Àjàyí in Sierra Leone, where he is recruited by missionaries. From
  there, he is put on a path that leads to him to study at Oxford and become a
  celebrated preacher, linguist and abolitionist who meets Queen Victoria. A
  remarkable tale of barbarism and resilience, Yorùbá Boy Running is the final
  work by the Nigerian novelist and film-maker Biyi Bándélé, who died in 2022
  aged 54. Weaving in Africa’s colonial history and imagined – and improbably
  comic – conversations between warring Yorùbá factions, it is based on the
  real-life story of Samuel Àjàyí Crowther, who was kidnapped in 1821 and sold
  into slavery. Crowther secured his freedom and went on to become the first
  Black Anglican bishop in west Africa. Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, who starred in
  Bándélé’s directorial debut Half of a Yellow Sun, is the narrator, expertly
  navigating the book’s huge cast of characters and dramatic tonal shifts. For
  Bándélé, Yorùbá Boy Running was personal, as it had a connection to his own
  family history. From the opening dedication, we discover that his
  great-grandfather was a slave who was liberated and who returned home to start
  his life again. • Available via Penguin Audio, 7hr 15min Further listening The
  Genius Myth: The Dangerous Allure of Rebels, Monsters and Rule-Breakers Helen
  Lewis, Penguin Audio, 9hr, 6min An examination of an overused word, Lewis’s
  study spans Renaissance artists, popular music behemoths and the big beasts of
  science as it asks why some are labelled geniuses and others are not. Read by
  the author. Notes to John Joan Didion, 4th Estate, 6hr, 33min Julianne Moore
  narrates this posthumous collection of diary entries from the late 1990s,
  written after Didion began seeing a psychiatrist. The entries are composed as
  if she were addressing her late husband John Dunne, and record her depressive
  episodes and fears for her daughter Quintana.
