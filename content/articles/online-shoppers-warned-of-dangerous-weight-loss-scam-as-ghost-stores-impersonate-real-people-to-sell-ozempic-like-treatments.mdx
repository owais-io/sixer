  impersonate real people to sell Ozempic-like treatments

  Online “ghost stores” masquerading as Australian businesses have expanded into
  advertising Ozempic-like weight loss treatments, and are impersonating real
  people, including a well-known dietitian, to recommend their products. After
  uncovering more than 140 sites falsely claiming to be Australian fashion
  retailers that prompted a public warning from the consumer regulator, Guardian
  Australia has identified a new scam that targets people trying to lose weight.
  Consumer experts say the scam is dangerous, because it goes beyond financial
  risk and threatens people’s health, while dietitian Lyndi Cohen says her image
  has been used without her consent to spruik a product she would never endorse.
  In one example, a Facebook page called “Emma Davis”, which claimed to be a
  “team of specialist in diabetes care and weight management” based in New South
  Wales, ran advertising for a product it claimed was a “GLP-1 plant based oral
  solution”. GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone in the body that helps
  regulate blood sugar levels and appetite. After the explosion in popularity of
  drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, it has become easy to order supplements,
  patches and pills online that claim to mimic their GLP-1 stimulating effects –
  even from reputable suppliers. The ad featured a testimonial signed off
  “Helen, 68, Sydney” who apparently considered the product to be “one of the
  best gifts I’ve given myself in years”. The promotion used a series of “before
  and after photos” which appeared to be AI-generated. It included detailed
  claims about the product, which it said was “perfect” for people with “big
  appetites” or “anyone who’s tried GLP-1 drops or injections without much
  result”. The comments section was filled with hopeful messages and glowing
  testimonials, posted by what appeared to be Australian women. But details in
  their profiles told a different story. A reverse image search suggested they
  were fake and their pictures stolen from real women including, in one case,
  Polish war correspondent Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska, whose photo was used
  for a profile of Gold Coast woman “Isla Taylor”. Pikulicka-Wilczewska
  confirmed it was her image and that she didn’t know it was being used in this
  way. “Obviously, the account in question should remove it asap and should not
  use it again,” she said in an email to Guardian Australia. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Another profile, apparently that of a middle-aged blonde
  woman from Canberra, used photos of three women including a guest columnist at
  a local newspaper in Ohio and a well-known former US TV host. Guardian
  Australia sought comment from both of these women and contacted the fake
  profiles. The ad linked to the website Maementcurves.com, which was still
  active as of Friday, although the page with the weight-loss products appeared
  to have been taken down after Guardian Australia contacted the site for
  comment. The site claimed the product, “STDEI GLP-1 Weight Loss Oral Liquid”,
  was made in Australia and developed by a local, family-owned company, even
  though it is readily available elsewhere on the internet including on
  AliExpress, eBay and an array of other “ghost stores”. Fake profiles and
  reviews ‘particularly insidious’ The Maementcurves.com site, portraying itself
  as Australian, claimed the treatment had even saved the life of a customer who
  had been “seriously obese and close to death” and was “especially endorsed by
  Lyndi Cohen, one of Australia’s leading dietitians”. Cohen told Guardian
  Australia she was aware of the site and that her likeness was “being abused
  and misrepresented” to promote a product she would “obviously not endorse”.
  “We sent them a cease and desist letter. We have not heard back. For me, the
  challenge is: I don’t know how to action it,” she said. “It feels like
  international waters in a way, there’s no jurisdiction. Whose job is it to
  control and manage this?” Guardian Australia bought the product for $46 on 23
  July, using PayPal. As of Thursday, no shipping notification had been sent.
  The PayPal receipt showed the payment was made to an entity called Altrix
  Limited, which Guardian Australia contacted for comment. Altrix Limited
  appears to be based in Hong Kong. But it is also the name of an English
  company, according to the UK’s companies register. The Maementcurves.com
  website is linked to another Hong Kong entity called Lanee Limited, which
  shares its name with a Welsh company which was dissolved in 2023. PayPal has
  previously conceded that it may not verify the identities of online sellers
  based outside Australia, while swindled customers have called for the platform
  to do more to help scam victims. A spokesperson on Thursday said PayPal had
  “zero-tolerance” for fraudulent activity on its platform. “Our teams work
  tirelessly to protect our customers,” they said. “Under PayPal’s Buyer
  Protection Policy, we will refund the full purchase price plus the original
  shipping charges for eligible claims.” The Consumer Action Law Centre’s legal
  practice director, Stephen Nowicki, said the use of fake profiles and fake
  reviews was “particularly insidious” and digital platforms should be held
  responsible. “It is important platforms are penalised for failing to block
  these fake ads, as they continue to benefit from the harms these ads cause for
  consumers,” he said. “In our view banks also have an obligation to identify
  scam accounts receiving these payments and block or flag them with consumers.”
  The deputy chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, Chandni
  Gupta, said pursuing each misleading profile or ghost store would be like “an
  endless whack-a-mole”. “A more systemic approach is what’s needed and it
  starts with holding digital platforms accountable to take real responsibility
  for fuelling such profiles in the first place,” she said. Advocates have
  previously called on Shopify and Meta to take responsibility for enabling this
  type of website and allowing them to run false advertising. The Australian
  Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) last month put the platforms on
  notice after it publicly announced it had written to them urging them to act
  on the ghost stores issue. Guardian Australia understands the ACCC has
  received responses from Meta and Shopify. A spokesperson for the regulator
  said scam websites should be reported to Scamwatch for assessment to determine
  whether they should be taken down. Meta declined to comment. Shopify, the
  Canadian multinational e-commerce platform headed by Tobias Lütke, has not
  responded to repeated requests for comment.
