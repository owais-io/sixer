  The UK culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said she won’t be watching the
  latest series of MasterChef on BBC because of the controversy over the conduct
  of its sacked presenters, but stopped short of saying the broadcaster should
  not show it. The first three episodes of the 21st series of the cookery show
  were released on iPlayer early on Wednesday morning, ahead of the first
  episode airing on BBC One at 8pm. The BBC website was highlighting the show
  under the category of “new and trending”. Nandy told BBC Breakfast: “It’s
  absolutely not for me, as the culture secretary and a member of the
  government, to tell broadcasters what they can and can’t broadcast.” Asked
  what she thought as a viewer, she said: “As a viewer, I won’t be watching it.”
  She added: “I’ve watched MasterChef on and off over the years, but I certainly
  won’t be watching this series.” Its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were
  sacked last month after a report into conduct on the show upheld allegations
  against them. A report into Wallace substantiated 45 allegations made against
  the former BBC presenter, including claims of inappropriate sexual language
  and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. An allegation that Torode had
  used a severely offensive racist slur was upheld. Last month, the Guardian
  reported that Sarah Shafi, one of the contestants in the latest series, had
  been edited out after she objected to it being broadcast because of the
  sustained allegations made against Wallace and Torode In other comments about
  the BBC, Nandy repeated her call for the broadcaster to “get a grip” after
  rows over the livestreamed Glastonbury performance from the punk rap duo Bob
  Vylan and the documentary that featured the son of a Hamas official. Pressure
  from Nandy has resulted in Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, having
  to insist he is still the right person to lead the corporation, after a
  succession of controversies that have led the culture secretary to accuse him
  of overseeing a “series of catastrophic failures” Asked on BBC’s Today
  programme on Wednesday morning whether she wanted to express confidence in
  Davie, Nandy replied: “Let me be really clear about this because there has
  been a lot of reporting around what I have or haven’t said about Tim Davie in
  particular.” “It is not my role to determine who works for the BBC. That is a
  matter for the board. That is set out in the charter. That is part of the
  independence of the BBC and that is really important.” Pressed on whether she
  had pulled back from her previous criticism, she said: “I absolutely believe
  that the BBC board has to get a grip on the very many failures which they have
  said to me themselves … the chairman of the board described them to me a
  catastrophic failings and he was right.” “When it comes the Gaza documentary
  and the errors that were made around that, the lack of due diligence,” she
  added, referring to a BBC documentary about children in Gaza, which was found
  to have breached the corporation’s editorial guidelines for accuracy by
  failing to disclose that its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.
  “When it comes to the decision to livestream an act at Glastonbury that was
  flagged already very high risk and to broadcast antisemitic death chants to
  the nation for several minutes on a Saturday afternoon – yes, these are
  catastrophic failures.”
