  “Who’d have thought we’d be doing this again?” Arthur Scargill said earlier
  this week, raising a laugh from the ex-miners standing in the picket line
  outside the National Coal Mining Museum. Staff at the Wakefield museum, many
  of them former coalminers, have walked out in a dispute over pay, and were
  joined on Thursday by the now 87-year-old former leader of the National Union
  of Mineworkers. Alongside him was Russ Kear, 60, who has worked as a guide at
  the museum since the UK’s last coalmine, Kellingley colliery, in North
  Yorkshire, closed in 2015. He began working as a miner at the age of 16, at
  Sharlston colliery, near Wakefield, before moving to Selby coalfield, and
  later, Kellingley. He said many of the museum’s staff, particularly those who
  have gone on strike, are former miners. “I’d say 99% of us, I suppose you
  could call us veterans of the ‘84-’85 [strike],” he said. “I’m one of the
  youngest, believe it or not, up at the Mining Museum.” In the 1980s, Kear was
  living at home with his parents – his mother did not do paid work, and he
  walked out of the pits alongside his father, Fred, a fellow miner. “It was
  horrible,” he said. “The Tory government managed to get some laws in very
  quickly that stopped my mum claiming any benefits, so there wasn’t a penny
  coming into our house. “But everybody got together, the community got
  together. Soup kitchens were opened up, we could get one meal a day. Up at the
  miners’ welfare club, we could go up once a week and you got a carrier bag
  full of shopping. “It really was horrible,” he added. “It really brought the
  community together, people helped each other out, but when they started
  shutting the mines, that destroyed communities. “You’d have thought that was a
  strike to end all strikes, wouldn’t you?” he said. “Like the big war should
  have been the war to end all wars. But it hasn’t worked out that way.” This
  strike is very different. “The last time, you’re up against the government
  that had big, deep pockets, and no matter what happened, you weren’t going to
  win,” he said. This time, he hoped, the industrial action may be successful.
  “When we do want to retire, if [the job] isn’t a decent income, how’re they
  going to attract somebody else to do what we’re doing?” he asked. About 40
  members of the Unison union are in dispute with the museum’s management over
  pay. They say the existing offer – of a rise of 5% or 80p an hour, whichever
  is greater, for all workers – is less than the previous deal proposed by the
  union and which they believed would be accepted by management. But the museum
  said it was an “increased offer” on previous pay proposals and “equates to a
  6% pay rise for many”. The strike, which is due to last until 14 September,
  with further action planned if an agreement is not reached, has caused
  underground tours to be suspended, but the rest of the museum remains open.
  “Workers only choose to strike as a last resort,” the Unison general
  secretary, Christina McAnea, said. “It’s unsurprising museum staff have
  reached that point when their employer has come back with an even worse pay
  offer. “Managers should do the right thing and pay staff fairly so the public
  can continue to learn about this important part of the nation’s industrial
  heritage.” “I don’t want to [strike], it’s not what I go there for,” Kear
  said. “I’m 60 years old, so I’m at the twilight of my working career. I don’t
  want to be doing this. “This is a place where I really do like to go and share
  my heritage and my history, and I just don’t want to be doing it [striking].”
  A spokesperson for the museum said the pay offer was higher than pay
  settlements in the public sector, including the police, schools and other
  museums. “This increased offer was rejected by Unison,” they said. “The union
  refused to share our revised offer with their members to see if they wished to
  accept it. “As a charitable organisation, the museum, which relies on external
  funding and donations, continues to face considerable financial pressures.”
  The spokesperson said they hoped “Unison will reconsider their position”,
  adding that they “remain committed to working closely with union
  representatives in the hope of a resolution”.
