  Arne Slot has said Liverpool should not fall into the trap of romanticising
  last season’s title triumph as a convincing stroll, when the reality was a
  hard slog that required a change in style. The Liverpool head coach insists he
  had to modify his team’s approach this season to implement the improvements
  necessary to defend the Premier League title. Liverpool won the league with
  four matches to spare and a 10-point cushion over Sunday’s opponents, Arsenal,
  but Slot has warned his players not to forget how difficult it was to break
  clear. The additions of Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitiké – and quite possibly
  Alexander Isak before the transfer deadline – were designed to make Liverpool
  a more dominant force. “I tell this to the players as well – not every game
  last season was Tottenham away [6-3] or West Ham away [5-0],” said Slot. “
  Always if you win something, everybody only looks back at some great attacks
  or some great wins, but the amount of times we struggled last season in a game
  was a lot. To romanticise last season as much as we do – and sometimes we make
  this mistake inside the building as well; I mean the players – is incorrect.
  Last season was, every single time, a struggle. Most wins were only by one
  goal and we had to fight really hard for it. “We didn’t win the league as
  [Manchester] City did for so many years with every single game being 4-0 up at
  half-time. We had to fight really hard for it. We need to improve but we had
  to improve compared to last season and we need to improve because the
  competition has improved.” Slot, who confirmed Andy Robertson is Liverpool’s
  vice-captain this season, believes the early-season struggles of the defenders
  Ibrahima Konaté and Milos Kerkez are part of the adaptation process. On
  Konaté, who could soon have competition from Marc Guéhi should Liverpool agree
  a deal for the Crystal Palace captain, he said: “He has things he can improve
  but starting this season with a different full-back next to him is different
  as well. His consistency [in bringing the ball out of defence] is definitely
  something he can improve, but that will improve the more we work together, the
  more he’s used to the right full-back next to him and the more he’s used to
  the other players that are in front of him as well.” As for Kerkez, the £40m
  summer signing from Bournemouth, Slot said: “In both games he has faced the
  biggest threat of the other team [Antoine Semenyo and Anthony Elanga]. It’s
  fair enough [to say he’s had a difficult start] but it’s not from him, it’s
  from us as a team.” Slot again refused to be drawn on Liverpool’s pursuit of
  Isak, although the likelihood of a British record deal for the striker has
  increased with Newcastle agreeing the £70m purchase of Nick Woltemade. “I said
  after Monday’s game that I could again make a substitution that affected the
  game,” said the coach, referencing Rio Ngumoha’s winner at Newcastle and
  Federico Chiesa’s late winner against Bournemouth. “There is no reason after
  two games to complain or think we need more but if we can strengthen the squad
  we will always try if it’s the right player and the right price. Let’s see if
  we do something.” Leipzig have registered an interest in Harvey Elliott but
  Liverpool have yet to receive an offer for the attacking midfielder they would
  consider. The left-back Kostas Tsimikas is close to joining Roma on loan.
