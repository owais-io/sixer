  Fawlty Towers: The Play Fifty years ago this month, Torquay’s most famous rat
  trap opened for business on the BBC. To mark the anniversary of the sitcom’s
  first broadcast, here’s a chance to watch the 2024 stage farce adapted by John
  Cleese from three episodes: The Hotel Inspectors, Communication Problems and
  The Germans. Featuring an introduction by Cleese, it’s on U&amp;GOLD on 19
  September and on demand from Sky, Virgin Media and Now. The Curious Case of
  Benjamin Button Its little life in the West End comes to a close on 11 October
  but the cast recording of Cornish musical The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
  has been wildly popular, with more than 1m streams to date. Jethro Compton and
  Darren Clark’s songs are as calming and rousing as the sea itself. Retrograde
  Is there a better modern designer of period dramas than Frankie Bradshaw? In
  between Blues for An Alabama Sky and Ballet Shoes at the National Theatre,
  Bradshaw captured 1950s Hollywood for Ryan Calais Cameron’s play about Sidney
  Poitier at the Kiln in London. It’s on NT at Home from 9 September. Handel’s
  Messiah American renaissance man Robert Wilson, who died aged 83 in July, left
  an extraordinary body of work ranging across theatre, opera and visual art.
  His 2020 staging of Handel’s Messiah, as reorchestrated by Mozart, is on Arte.
  Hot Mess Sparky, funny, stuffed with earworms and cleverly developing its
  canny concept, Jack Godfrey and Ellie Coote’s musical was one of the buzziest
  shows at this year’s Edinburgh fringe. It’s your everyday tale of romance
  turned sour, except the couple in question are Earth and Humanity. Listen to
  the EP – and catch it in Birmingham and London. Madu After a video of
  11-year-old Anthony Madu dancing in the rain in Nigeria went viral, he arrived
  as a student at Elmhurst ballet school in Birmingham. This film, winner of the
  2025 Emmy for outstanding arts and culture documentary, follows his training.
  On Disney+. Bradford’s Big Bash Bradford’s year as UK city of culture still
  has plenty in store, including the Javaad Alipoor Company’s version of Fiona
  Mozley’s Yorkshire novel Elmet. A BBC documentary charts the festival’s
  opening outdoor spectacle, Rise, co-created by magician Steven Frayne, the
  local boy better known as Dynamo. Snow White: The Sacrifice Choreographer Liv
  Lorent has created two versions of Snow White: one for families and this more
  monstrous “after dark” version for over-16s, rewritten by Carol Ann Duffy and
  now directed for the screen by Game of Thrones star Ben Crompton. On Marquee
  TV.
