  Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget will take place on 26 November, the Treasury has
  announced, amid mounting speculation over tax increases. With the government
  under pressure on the economy, the chancellor has previously said measures
  designed to reboot growth would form the basis of her highly anticipated tax
  and spending plans. The late November budget date will give Reeves time to
  prepare the ground for potential tax changes, raising the prospect of a
  high-stakes party conference season as Labour heads to Liverpool at the end of
  September. Reeves is understood to have been exploring several revenue-raising
  measures over the summer months amid concern that rising borrowing costs, a
  sluggish growth outlook, higher inflation and welfare U-turns could expose a
  shortfall in the government finances worth up to £40bn. The chancellor and the
  prime minister have, however, committed to sticking to Labour’s manifesto
  promise not to raise taxes on “working people”, including through income tax,
  national insurance and VAT. Reeves has come under pressure from leftwing
  Labour MPs and campaigners to consider introducing a wealth tax. While the
  chancellor has privately ruled out such a step, she has been exploring options
  for raising more money from wealthier taxpayers, including changes to capital
  gains tax, as well as inheritance and property levies. Announcing the date of
  the budget, the Treasury said Reeves had commissioned the Office for Budget
  Responsibility to prepare forecasts for the economy and public finances. The
  chancellor must give the independent watchdog 10 weeks’ notice. There are
  hopes in the Treasury that news from Britain’s economy could improve before
  budget day, helping the chancellor to strike a more upbeat tone after a
  difficult first year in power for Labour. Reeves could benefit from updated
  International Monetary Fund forecasts at its annual meeting in Washington in
  mid-October. However, there are concerns the outlook for the economy could
  worsen amid pressure from Donald Trump’s trade war and rising inflationary
  pressures hitting the cost of living for households. Business leaders also
  warn that a tax-raising autumn budget would add to the headwinds facing the
  economy, hitting growth and adding to the financial strain on households.
