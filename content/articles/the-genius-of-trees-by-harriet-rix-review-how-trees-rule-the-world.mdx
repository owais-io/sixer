  When was the last time you stopped to say thank you to a tree? Perhaps it’s
  something we should do more often. After all, we owe them everything, from the
  air we breathe to the soil beneath our feet, and far less obvious things too.
  We have trees to thank for the swirl of our fingerprints, our posture, and
  possibly even our dreams. In her new book, British tree science consultant
  Harriet Rix presents trees as an awesome force of nature, a force that has,
  over time, “woven the world into a place of great beauty and extraordinary
  variety”. How have trees done this? And can they really be said to possess
  “genius”? If you think of life first emerging from the sea, hundreds of
  millions of years ago, you might picture something like the Tiktaalik, a
  human-sized floppy-footed fish that hauled itself out of the shallows some
  time in the Late Devonian. But the evolutionary eureka moment arguably came
  long before that, when one lucky green alga washed up on the Cambrian shore
  and managed to survive the deadly UV light on land. “Plants learning to
  survive and use UV light was a thunderbolt,” writes Rix. It “allowed a whole
  new chemistry to emerge, root and branch, in a whole new place: dry land …
  Safe from predators, who for the moment were left in the sea behind them,
  these photosynthesising cells started on a path that led to the amazing
  complexity of trees.” Viewed on cosmic fast forward, as part of “a strange,
  apparently accelerated world, in which continents drift around like rubber
  ducks, bumping into one another”, trees seem almost godlike, using their
  biochemical wizardry to transform the Earth from a stony, storm-ravaged
  wasteland into a place where life could thrive. They broke barren rock into
  soil, canalised flood waters into rivers, pumped oxygen into the atmosphere,
  and turned the desert green. Element by element, trees have learned to control
  water, air, fire and the ground beneath us, as well as fungi, plants, animals,
  and even people, shaping them according to their own “tree-ish” agenda. Some
  fairly knotty chunks of biochemistry and evolutionary history are smoothed by
  lush descriptions of contemporary habitats as Rix travels the world, from the
  cloud forests of La Gomera to the junipers of Balochistan. She is an intrepid
  and erudite guide. Despite the title, this is not a book that gives much
  weight to questions of tree consciousness or intelligence. It doesn’t stop to
  consider whether our leafy friends have feelings. Rix acknowledges that the
  early work of Suzanne Simard – whose research into resource exchange between
  trees via underground mycelial networks gave rise to the concept of the wood
  wide web – was “beautiful field science” and “immensely compelling”, but she
  gives short shrift to subsequent anthropomorphic claims that trees “talk” or
  “love” or “mother” one another. “Putting a nurturing mammalian face on to the
  giants of the forest was also a massive betrayal of the complexities of an
  organism that could be thousands of years old,” she writes. “Thinking of the
  5,000 years in which Methuselah [a storied bristlecone pine] has had to
  negotiate existence makes simple narratives about the gentle exchange of
  nourishing sugars seem astoundingly trite.” What, then, is the genius of
  trees? Rix locates it in the elegant solutions they have devised to the
  constantly changing riddle of life. It’s a genius you can smell in the rich
  terpenes given off by trees to seed clouds, generating rain and expanding
  their own habitats. It’s a genius you can taste in the sweet fruit that makes
  animals do trees’ bidding, and arguably gave our simian ancestors their
  brains. It’s a vast, generative genius that has nurtured our own. Our clever
  fingers – and fingerprints – evolved to grip their branches. Our dreams were
  born in the safe, fragrant nests we built in their canopies. This is why, Rix
  argues, we find the smell of wood so comforting, and why we like to press our
  noses between the pages of books. Genius is too small a word for all of this.
