  Hundreds of staff at two of California’s most popular national parks have
  voted to unionize, a move that comes during a troubled summer for the National
  Park Service, which has seen the Trump administration enact unprecedented
  staff and budget cuts. In an election held between July and August, more than
  97% of workers at Yosemite and Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon national parks voted
  in support of organizing a union, according to a statement from the National
  Federation of Federal Employees. The Federal Labor Relations Authority
  certified the results last week. “I am honored to welcome the Interpretive
  Park Rangers, scientists, biologists, photographers, geographers, and so many
  other federal employees in essential roles at both Yosemite and Sequoia &amp;
  Kings Canyon to our union,” said Randy Erwin, the NFFE national president. “By
  unionizing, hundreds of previously unrepresented employees have obtained a
  critical voice in their workplace and now have the power to make significant
  changes to benefit themselves and their colleagues.” The vote means 600
  workers at the parks, including park rangers, researchers, educators, fee
  collectors and first responders, among others, will be represented by the
  National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE). Labor organizers have been
  trying to form a union at the parks for years but did not have the necessary
  support until this year when the Trump administration’s mass firings left the
  parks service in turmoil, the Los Angeles Times reported. “It comes as no
  surprise workers in the National Park Service are overwhelmingly in favor of
  unionizing, as federal employees across the country have been faced with
  reductions in force, threats to workplace protections, and slashed agency
  budgets under this administration,” Erwin said. Since Trump took office this
  year the National Park Service, which manages 85m acres (34m hectares) of
  America’s public lands, has lost a quarter of its permanent staff, seasonal
  hiring is down and the administration is seeking to slash more than $1bn from
  the NPS budget. The US interior secretary, Doug Burgum, has said the cuts were
  “clearing out the barn”. Despite the upheaval, the federal government has
  ordered parks to stay open to the public. That has left staffers scrambling to
  manage the parks amid the peak summer season, and, as the Guardian reported
  last month, archeologists are managing ticket booths while park
  superintendents have cleaned bathrooms. At Yosemite, scientists were also
  cleaning public bathrooms because there were no other workers to do it. Amid
  the turmoil this year, NPS employees told the Guardian earlier this summer
  they had received unsigned emails from the office of personnel management
  urging them to resign and find a job in the private sector. “Every day you
  come to work and you have no idea what is going to happen next. It’s like we
  are all being subjected to psychological warfare,” a staffer said this spring.
  Earlier this year at Yosemite, laid-off employees hung a US flag upside down,
  a symbol of distress, at the park’s El Capitan to bring attention the cuts.
  Erwin with the NFFE said the union would take “every step possible” to
  increase staffing and resources, and defend employees.
