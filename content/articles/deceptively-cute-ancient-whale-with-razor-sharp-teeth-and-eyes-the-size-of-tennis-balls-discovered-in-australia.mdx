  “Small and deceptively cute, but definitely not harmless” is how scientists
  have described a new species of ancient whale, from a 25-million-year-old
  fossil found on Victoria’s surf coast. This early species, called Janjucetus
  dullardi, was an extremely unusual animal, said Dr Erich Fitzgerald, senior
  curator of vertebrate palaeontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute. It
  was tiny – about the size of a dolphin – and had razor-sharp teeth, bearing
  little resemblance to its closest living relatives in the baleen whale family,
  including blue whales, some of the largest animals to ever live. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The whale’s heavily built skull was “almost
  over-engineered”, Fitzgerald said. It had relatively large eyes – approaching
  the size of tennis balls – and a short snout with deeply rooted teeth for
  gripping and tearing. “This was a really gnarly whale that I personally
  wouldn’t want to get in the water with,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s essentially a
  little whale with big eyes and a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth,” said
  co-author Ruairidh Duncan, a researcher at the Museums Victoria Research
  Institute and Monash University. “Imagine the shark-like version of a baleen
  whale – small and deceptively cute, but definitely not harmless.” Duncan and
  Fitzgerald described the new species in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean
  Society from an “exceedingly rare” fossil find that included a partial skull,
  ear bone and eight teeth – key features that enabled the scientists to
  identify it as a new species. When fully grown, the species was probably about
  3m long. But the fossil was most likely a juvenile, based on its wide open
  root canals, barely worn teeth and bone connections that were not as tightly
  fused as in a mature specimen. “This individual was probably no more than
  about two to 2.2m long,” Fitzgerald said. “You could fit it on to a beach
  towel.” Janjucetus dullardi lived during the Oligocene (30-23 million years
  ago) – about halfway back to the extinction of the dinosaurs – a time of
  global warmth and rising seas. It was the fourth known species from a group
  known as mammalodontids, unusual animals that were an “early offshoot” of the
  baleen whale family tree, Fitzgerald said. He said evidence from fossils of
  tiny plankton from the Jan Juc Formation – the same kind of rock – suggested
  sea temperatures in southern Australia would have been warmer then, more akin
  to subtropical waters off Coffs Harbour. “In these seas, there was this
  extraordinary abundance of life, including all these little whales, giant
  penguins, sharks – about a third, or even twice as long as today’s great white
  shark – and various other primitive dolphins and other species of whales. It
  was a very different world,” Fitzgerald said. It was a turning point in the
  history of life in the oceans, and the beginning of an explosion in the
  diversification of whales and dolphins. Flinders University palaeontologist
  Prof John Long, who was not involved in the paper, said the fossil was a
  remarkable find that could help uncover the evolutionary steps as early
  carnivorous whales transitioned to become filter feeders. “To understand the
  radiation and evolution of the big baleen whales that live today, we need to
  look at the fossil record to see the stages of how they acquired their special
  characters,” he said. It also highlighted the value of fieldwork, by
  professional scientists and members of the public, Long said. The discovery
  wouldn’t have been possible without local resident and school principal Ross
  Dullard, who found the specimen in 2019 while walking along the beach near Jan
  Juc on Victoria’s surf coast. Recognising the fossil’s significance, Dullard
  donated the fossil to the museum for further study. In recognition of his
  contribution, the new species was named in his honour. This highlighted the
  critical role that members of the public continued to play in Australian
  palaeontology, Fitzgerald said. “It’s a reminder that world-changing fossils
  can be found in your own back yard.” “Victoria has got a rich fossil
  heritage,” said Long. “I grew up in Melbourne and collected fossils as a kid
  since I was seven. You can find fossils of nearly all geological periods in
  Victoria … if you know where to look.”
