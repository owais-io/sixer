  The ugly truth: have Trump’s tariffs finally put an end to Crocs’ 19-year
  reign?

  I’ve been the Guardian’s Crocs correspondent for 19 years now, and get wheeled
  out for highs and lows. This is a definite low for the rubbery perforated
  clogs: the share price is down nearly 30% – its lowest level for three years –
  and revenues are expected to drop by between 9% and 11% in the current
  quarter. To blame? Donald Trump mostly, and his tariffs. It’s not the first
  time Crocs have suffered at the hands – or feet – of a Republican US
  president, as it happens. I remember the beginning. They’d actually been
  around since 2002, but it was 2006 when the revolution properly got going. A
  bunch of cool people – Nicole Kidman, Matt Damon, Al Pacino – began to be seen
  out and about in them. George W Bush too, over presidential seal-emblazoned
  golf socks (the crocs’n’socks debate is an issue in itself), but even that
  didn’t stop Crocs’ inexorable rise. Fearful of missing out, I got myself a
  pair, in black (play safe to start with). I remember putting them on for the
  first time, a Cinderella glass slipper moment. How can they be so comfortable?
  So light? (Answer to the latter: because they’re not in fact made from rubber,
  but a proprietary cell resin called Croslite). They took me on holiday – the
  beach, boats and rocks – with no need for any other footwear. And then back
  from holiday, home, gardening, putting the bins out in the snow (socks
  allowed). I began to wear them at work; not just me: kitchen workers, hospital
  workers, cleaners, nurses, surgeons. As well as pairing well with scrubs,
  they’re easy to clean, comfortable to stand in for long periods and the little
  nodules on the inside massage the undersides of our feet. I’ve worn them ever
  since. The revolution didn’t meet with universal approval. The style police
  came for us, brandishing truncheons. Crocs are ugly they said, they look like
  clown shoes. Maxim magazine ranked them the sixth worst thing to happen to men
  in 2007; they made a Time magazine worst invention list in 2010; blogs popped
  up, like IHateCrocs.com; plus a Facebook group, I Don’t Care How Comfortable
  Cros Are, You Look Like a Dumbass. Ha, guess what though: we were right and
  they were wrong. Fashion was the dumbass, and finally saw sense. Christopher
  Kane sent Croc-shod models down the catwalk at his 2017 spring show.
  Balenciaga hopped on the bandwagon, and then up, with a 10cm platform version,
  encrusted with what Vogue said looked like “the kind of plastic fridge magnets
  sold at airports.” Yours for just £600. Crocs had a good pandemic, with record
  £1bn revenue in 2020, and continued to do well in the early 2020s. The
  Crocerati continued to grow too – Justin Bieber, Post Malone, Ariana Grande,
  Nicki Minaj (the Crocs website crashed after she posted a picture of herself
  in a hot pink bedazzled pair). Some of us smiled quietly to ourselves; yeah
  all right Nicki, we’ve known for some time. Royal approval too. When David
  Hockney – David Hockney! – went to lunch at Buckingham Palace he wore a
  checked suit and a pair of yellow Crocs. “Yellow galloshes!” declared King
  Charles, alighting on the nearest thing from his own world. “Beautifully
  chosen!” As well as tariffs, trade uncertainty and consumer timidity, there
  has been some speculation that Crocs’ near 20-year stranglehold on the “ugly
  shoe” space is loosening, with other options snapping at the heels of the
  market leader. My colleague Tim Dowling has been spotted wandering around in
  what seem to be a pair of foot-gloves. Ridiculous! You’re not going to go to
  Buckingham Palace in those, are you? Crocs teetered on the brink of bankruptcy
  in 2009, but came back. Fashion – and the markets – are fickle things, they go
  up and down, like the tides. Class is permanent though. We the faithful will
  stand steadfastly, like Antony Gormley figures (does Gormley wear Crocs,
  anyone know?), while those tides – along with fads and US presidents – come
  and go. The water and the sand will pour out through the holes, we will be
  comfortable and happy, and yes, cool, because we will be wearing, and continue
  to wear, Crocs.
