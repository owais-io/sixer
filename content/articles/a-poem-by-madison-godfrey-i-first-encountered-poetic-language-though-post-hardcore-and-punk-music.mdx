  Vroom Vroom Plays In The Background by Madison Godfrey Behind the wheel, I
  press the ball of my bare foot against the worn ridges of the accelerator. The
  road opens into a series of soft curves without speed signs. Each bend feels
  as though it was drawn by someone practising the letter s in cursive. I grin
  at paddocks of cows, imagine the taste of grass. Picture cartoon cowboys with
  frayed yellow wheat held between their teeth. Consider the weight of multiple
  stomachs and the rooms inside my own torso. Make neighing sounds when I pass
  horses. Think about giving birth in a paddock, picture pink plastic
  dishwashing gloves shoved inside of me. I wonder what the human equivalent of
  udders is. Remember lactating friends and their rhythmic pumps – sitting
  beside them in parked cars outside the party. It was my responsibility to find
  a decent radio station while they untied and retied a series of ribbons: those
  expensive maternity blouses that promise modesty for someone else. Some bodies
  are resources while some bodies are redactions. I imagine teats censored like
  nipples; pixellated online; itchy beneath strips of electrical tape at the
  pride parade. Behind the wheel, I imagine a series of small red tassels
  hanging from the underbelly of a cow. Vroom Vroom Plays In The Background is
  an excerpt from a verse novel I am currently writing, in which a fictional
  narrative is told through a sequence of poetic fragments that feel like a
  fever dream. Ultimately, the book is about love and the lonely rooms that rage
  backs us into. As someone who first encountered poetic language though
  post-hardcore and punk music, I aim to create poems that embody the momentum
  of those lyrics I yelled at 16. In this piece, that energetic intensity is
  curated through flickering imagery and brief glimpses of fictive memory.
  Mimicking the way that fields flash past as you drive fast on a country road,
  the persona’s unruly thoughts tumble outwards in quick succession. By drawing
  from the qualities of a cinematic montage or a refrain yelled in a mosh pit, I
  wanted this scene to immerse the reader in an accelerated intensity that
  propels them forwards, as though they’re positioned in the passenger seat.
  Despite the fictional plot and persona of the verse novel, moments from my own
  life have snuck into the work. I often approach poetry as a site of
  observation and reckoning, where the writing process constitutes an act of
  inquiry. Rather than writing about what is already certain, as though
  describing the light at the end of the tunnel, my creativity is fuelled by
  curiosity. From within the tunnel, I am writing towards the possibility of
  light. Here, I am reckoning with rage and redaction. I am thinking about
  electrical tape peeling away on sweaty dancefloors; about legislated flesh;
  about conversations held in parked cars outside roller derby training. I am
  thinking about anger’s curriculum; about how some people’s anger is accepted
  as an inevitability, while others are taught to internalise it; I am thinking
  about the way rage stays inside the body after it has been swallowed
  repeatedly; I am thinking about driving fast on an empty road, with speakers
  threatening to burst. Australian Poetry Month runs throughout August and
  includes festivals, events, workshops, and a commissioned poem of the day
  brought to you by Red Room Poetry. Find out more here
