  Emma Raducanu has crashed out of the Canadian Open in straight sets, going
  down 6-2, 6-1 to the American fifth seed Amanda Anisimova in the third round.
  Raducanu had won both of their previous meetings but rarely looked like
  extending that run as she held her serve just once in either set in Montreal.
  Anisimova, who made the Wimbledon final in July, came from 40-15 down to break
  Raducanu’s serve in the second game of the match and, although the British No
  1 broke back immediately, she was unable to fashion another break point in the
  contest. The American broke again to make it 3-1 and added a third break to
  wrap up the set. Her dominance continued in the second set as Raducanu won
  just eight points on her own serve, avoiding the whitewash after losing the
  first five games. Anisimova served it out to book a place in the fourth round,
  where she will face 10th seed Elina Svitolina, who stormed past Anna
  Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-1 on Friday night. Iga Świątek needed little more than an
  hour to complete a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Germany’s Eva Lys. The Wimbledon
  champion next faces Denmark’s Clara Tauson, who beat Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-3,
  6-0. Jessica Pegula’s bid for a third straight Montreal title was ended by
  thew orld No 386 Anastasija Sevastova. The Latvian, a former world No 11 who
  has had lengthy spells out on maternity leave and with a torn ACL, beat the
  third seed Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 to book a date with Naomi Osaka.
