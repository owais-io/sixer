  Queensland’s state forensic services laboratory has repeated an error which
  led to “one of the greatest failures of a justice system in the world”,
  affecting evidence in thousands of criminal cases including rapes and murders.
  The latest testing failure was revealed in a review into Forensic Services
  Queensland released on Monday, which also found that hundreds of rape victims
  were waiting “over 12 months” for the lab to test rape kits, a process that
  should be completed “ideally within five days”. In 2022, the first of two
  inquiries into Forensic Services Queensland found that the laboratory’s
  threshold for testing was set too high, calling into question DNA evidence
  used in thousands of criminal cases, including for crimes such as rape and
  murder. Sign up: AU Breaking News email On 19 November last year, the
  laboratory implemented a new threshold for testing for DNA. But according to a
  review by forensic scientist Prof Kirsty Wright and former FBI expert Dr Bruce
  Budowle, tabled in parliament on Monday, the new limit was again incorrect.
  “After introduction of the new DNA threshold, a Priority 1 crime scene sample
  from a violent unresolved crime was not fully tested because it fell below the
  threshold,” Wright’s report found. “[Queensland police] requested for it to be
  fully tested, and it provided a usable DNA profile that assisted the
  investigation.” “Priority 1” refers to “the most urgent” samples from “violent
  and unresolved cases where the offender has not been identified”. “We’ve found
  evidence that shows there’s potentially a large number of samples that aren’t
  being fully tested … and these samples are from major crimes. These are from
  rapes, these are from murders,” Wright said at a press conference on Monday.
  “So it seems like the lessons from the first and second inquiry have not been
  learned.” Wright said the lab was repeatedly detecting unacceptable levels of
  contamination but not resolving the problem. The review found that since
  October 2023 it had presented unreliable DNA evidence to the police and
  ultimately the courts. “They were processing crime scene samples in a dirty
  lab. They knew this. There was evidence of this for at least … a year and a
  half,” Wright said. A lack of capacity at the lab caused enormous delays,
  including for the testing of rape kits. Outside priority 1 cases, no samples
  were tested within timelines set by the police, the report found. Wright
  recommended the government outsource most forensic testing for “at least two
  years”, while gradually building up capacity in FSQ. In May, the state
  government announced a $50m investment in outsourcing. The report also
  recommended the lab immediately stop testing all rape kits, due to concerns
  over the reliability of its results. It also criticised Forensic Services
  Queensland for intruding in police efforts to contract overseas laboratory to
  test 15 of its most urgent rape kits. Without the knowledge of the police, the
  laboratory asked the overseas service to halt its testing and return the
  samples for testing in Queensland. This did not occur, because FSQ did not
  organise an import permit. “Ultimately this intervention just delayed the
  testing of the rape kits by at least three months,” the report found. “FSQ is
  not prioritising victims of crime in decision making, and suggests FSQ is not
  appropriately supporting QPS efforts to resolve sexual offences.” There were
  511 untested rape kits in Queensland as of September 2024, the review found.
  The median turnaround time for testing of samples from major crimes was 412
  days, despite a reduction in forensic evidence being submitted by police, the
  review found. Clearing the backlog of 32,000 historical cases that must be
  retested as a result of the earlier inquiries would take 10 years, Wright
  said. The FSQ backlog also includes 177 homicides. There are 343 matters in
  the upper court awaiting DNA results and statements. The report describes the
  mismanagement of the then Queensland Health laboratory between 2007 and 2023
  as “one of the greatest failures of a justice system in the world”, judging
  that “many thousands of victims had been denied justice”, and public “trust in
  forensic DNA services lost”. The state government announced it would appoint a
  new expert team to overhaul forensic services led by former New South Wales
  police commissioner Mick Fuller, with the ongoing involvement of the review’s
  authors. • In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is
  on 1800 737 732. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808
  2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is
  1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Other international helplines may be found via
