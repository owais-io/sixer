  and lengthened

  It was on his honeymoon in Kuala Lumpur, looking out of his hotel window at
  the silvery points of the world’s tallest twin skyscrapers, that Frank decided
  it was time to become taller. He had recently confessed to his new wife how
  much his height had bothered him since he was a teenager. As a man dedicated
  to self-improvement, Frank wanted to take action. He picked up the phone,
  called a clinic in Turkey that specialises in leg lengthening surgery – and
  made a booking. “I had a lot of second thoughts – at the end of the day,
  someone’s going to break your legs,” he says, propped up on a hotel bed in
  Istanbul, his legs splayed in front of him, bracketed by a brace on each
  thigh. His wife, Emilia, tends to him, fetching painkillers and ice packs for
  the wound sites where the braces puncture his legs. For the first two weeks
  after surgery, Frank needed her help to get on and off the toilet, but now,
  six weeks later, it’s largely only to get off the bed. The bleep of an alarm
  interrupts our conversation: time to insert a key into the metal bracket on
  the side of Frank’s thigh and turn it, forcing apart the rods that have been
  inserted into his femurs. New bone grows into the gap in his thigh bones, one
  agonising millimetre at time. Each turn of the key dictates how much the
  patient can grow, and Frank is aiming for five turns each day rather than the
  four recommended by his doctors, to gain a precious extra quarter of a
  centimetre. It means more suffering, but Frank is all about putting in the
  work to get what he wants. “Time to grow!” Emilia says, with a little laugh,
  as the alarm sounds. At 5ft 6in (1.7m) tall, slightly under the average male
  height worldwide, Frank, 38, feels he has lived life “as a short man”. But
  speak with any patient at the Wanna Be Taller clinic in Istanbul, where Frank
  chose to undergo leg lengthening, and it becomes clear that shortness is
  relative. Men over 6ft have had the procedure. One tells me he needed surgery
  to “correct” his bow legs and decided to add some height at the same time. A
  slim blond woman – a rare example of a female patient here – who was 5ft 3in
  before surgery, looks me square in the eyes as she deadpans that shortness “is
  the last acceptable prejudice in society” to explain why she underwent the
  procedure to gain two inches. (The clinic also offers leg shortening surgery,
  though this is far less common; only nine patients have so far had it done,
  mainly women.) Frank, meanwhile, is determined to become taller than Emilia –
  who is 5ft 5in – by gaining 9cm, just above the 8.5cm doctors told him is the
  maximum his muscles and tendons can safely handle. This would make him 5ft
  9in. His dream is simple: being average height. Five turns of the key daily
  means he stands to gain just over a millimetre a day for 10 weeks. It’s not
  without its challenges: “Sometimes the nerve pain wrecks me.” Frank prides
  himself on being a self-starter: he has the words “self made” tattooed across
  his knuckles and a likeness of his hero, Arnold Schwarzenegger – in his view,
  the ultimate self-made man – on his thigh. Arnie’s face is slowly being
  stretched as Frank grows. “I’m making my own height, choosing how tall I want
  to be,” he says. “I am very ambitious: if I want something, I go for it. Until
  I do it, it almost torments me.” To the casual observer, leg lengthening looks
  like a form of medieval torture, and earlier that day I watched as a
  physiotherapist gently lifted each of Frank’s new legs while he groaned with
  pain – straightening his hamstrings feels impossible, as if they might snap.
  He is in recovery from the first of two surgeries: this one broke his femurs
  to insert metal rods and add fixators. The second will remove the fixators
  after he has completed the key-turning process, in three months’ time. Some
  patients choose to have their shin bones broken instead, or in addition, in a
  bid to be even taller. If having your leg bones cut in half sounds painful
  enough, the true agony comes afterwards. Ensconced on the periphery of
  Istanbul, in a hotel built from what looks like plasterboard and fake gold
  leaf, about 20 leg lengthening patients spend their days obsessing over their
  muscles and tendons, making sure they stretch to accommodate their new bones.
  This means daily physiotherapy to learn how to walk again, blood thinners,
  massages and a lot of painkillers. While there are few global statistics on
  the number of people opting to have this done each year, one Indian market
  research firm estimated the global limb lengthening industry will balloon by
  2030 to be worth $8.6bn (£6.4bn). “I always tell them, 1cm is not more
  important than your health,” says Serkan Aksoy from Wanna Be Taller, who
  supervises Frank’s physio. Most of their patients are men, and Aksoy has to
  dissuade many clients from trying to gain too much height. From the clinic’s
  perspective, the risks come from patients not adhering to a strict aftercare
  routine, but problems and even deaths do occur. Blood clots, joint issues,
  failure to grow new bone tissue, blood vessel injuries, scarring and chronic
  pain are all potential complications, as well as “ballerina syndrome”, where
  the achilles tendons fail to stretch adequately, forcing the feet into an
  exaggerated arch and preventing the patient from walking. Last year, a patient
  who had flown in from Saudi Arabia died from a blood clot 16 days after
  undergoing leg lengthening surgery. When I ask Wanna Be Taller about this,
  they say an investigation by the Saudi authorities found no fault with their
  surgeon. Even though Frank chose a cheaper option, involving external fixators
  rather than an electronic internal device, the $32,000 (£24,000) price tag –
  including months in a hotel and physiotherapy – has put a major dent in the
  funds the newlyweds had planned to use as downpayment for a mortgage. When I
  ask about this, Emilia describes how months of travel across Asia gave them a
  new perspective. The couple began to think they were placing too much
  importance on material things rather than aiming for true contentment. “Having
  food, a comfortable bed – that’s real happiness,” Emilia says. “After that, if
  it’s buying a house, we’ll go for it. And if it’s breaking your legs and being
  tall, go for it.” * * * The idea that breaking bones can provide a way to
  shorten or lengthen a limb is widely attributed to the Soviet surgeon Gavriil
  Abramovich Ilizarov, who developed the “Ilizarov technique” in Russia in 1951.
  This involved adding external metal rings around a broken bone to stabilise
  it, held in place by metal pins or wires. If the patient wishes to grow, the
  frame can be used to draw sections away from one another; Ilizarov found new
  bone grows between them, adding length. His technique has since been adopted
  globally. While more sophisticated techniques are now common, the principle
  remains. Today, leg lengthening is even available on the NHS at a specialised
  clinic within the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital. Even so, a spokesperson
  for the RNOH’s limb reconstruction unit tells me the 100 or so patients they
  treat annually are there to recover from injury or correct deformities – and
  patients lengthening both legs are rare. The same spokesperson lists their
  concerns about patients going overseas for “a procedure with significant risks
  and an arduous physical therapy requirement”. These include clinics
  downplaying the dangers while overplaying “the cosmetic benefits”, and a lack
  of proper aftercare. The NHS routinely treats patients with problems after
  surgery abroad, and a study conducted by the RNOH “revealed a significant cost
  burden to the NHS” for treating botched cosmetic leg lengthening. China’s
  health ministry banned cosmetic leg lengthening in 2006, fearing the dangers
  to patients in a growing and unregulated industry, but the practice has
  persisted elsewhere. Private treatment in the UK can cost upwards of £50,000,
  with some surgeons charging £240,000 to lengthen two bones in each leg. What
  makes a growing number fly to Turkey from as far afield as Australia or Japan
  is lower prices. * * * Frank can reel off a list of negative experiences
  stretching back into adolescence that he believes stemmed from his height.
  There was the pain of his friends suddenly becoming taller than him after he
  stopped growing around the age of 15. There were the kids at school who
  taunted him for his height; a longtime online fan of his artwork who remarked,
  on meeting him, that Frank was “shorter than I expected”; or the guys who
  randomly shoved him in the street a few years ago, tearing out his headphones.
  They wouldn’t have done that to a taller man, he reasons. In Frank’s view,
  tall people don’t realise their privilege. “It’s hard to explain if you’re not
  a short man yourself, but in modern society it’s almost a curse,” he says, as
  he carefully keeps watch over his pain medication and blood thinners. Then, of
  course, there were all the stinging dating experiences before he met Emilia,
  such as the woman 6in smaller who showed up for coffee and immediately said he
  was too short for her. Experiences like this, he says, are standard for his
  short male friends. The dating app Tinder even recently trialled a feature
  that lets paying users set a height preference. “Even tall men are having
  problems now,” he says. “The new fashion is 6ft 4in, otherwise you’re a piece
  of shit.” All of this wore Frank down before he stumbled across a YouTube
  video a few years ago, showing leg lengthening surgery. Our conversation
  inevitably drifts towards issues of masculinity. A recent study showed that
  young men in the UK now outspend women on minimally invasive “tweakments” such
  as Botox injections – which some practitioners now jokingly refer to as
  “Brotox”. Then there’s the growth of the so-called “manosphere”, which deifies
  the ripped torso of Joe Rogan or Photoshops Donald Trump on to a picture of a
  bodybuilder. Surely when we’re talking about male height, we’re really talking
  about masculinity – and power? Frank bats it away: he doesn’t have any time
  for those toxic alpha male types. “This surgery isn’t about that – I don’t
  think it’s about being more masculine, it’s about being average height,” he
  says. Not long after our conversation, Frank woke up one night in “some of the
  worst pain I’ve ever felt”. He tried to scream while struggling to breathe,
  but the four huge ice packs on his legs did little to dull the pain. After
  clinicians rushed him to a nearby hospital, he was treated for a pulmonary
  embolism – a blood clot that travelled into the arteries of the lung. A
  representative from Wanna Be Taller later tells me Frank and the Saudi Arabian
  patient are the only two of their 700 clients who have experienced a blood
  clot following surgery. Frank, it turns out, needed a higher dose of blood
  thinners. But while a blood clot is a rare side-effect, the fate of the Saudi
  patient shows that it can be fatal. Even from his hospital bed, in agonising
  pain, Frank had continued to turn the key on his fixators. But after speaking
  with his doctor, it turned out his nerves and tendons had been stretched to
  their limit – he was unable to straighten his legs. It was time to remove the
  fixators early, cutting off his growth. He had grown 7.3cm, putting him just
  under his 5ft 9in goal. Frank is determined he won’t be treating shorter men
  any differently now, but one interaction with another patient has stayed with
  him. “I saw him as a short man for the first time. Not in a bad way, but I saw
  why people perceived me as a short man – and I felt tall compared with him.
  Now, every time a woman comes near me, they’re shorter,” he says, with
  undisguised glee. “It’s worth it at the end, if you see the difference between
  me and her,” he says, pointing at Emilia. Some names have been changed. • The
