  When it comes to glamorous fans, Emilio Pucci was the envy of other fashion
  designers. During the 1950s and 60s, the “prince of prints” – as the designer
  became known – dressed Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Kennedy and Sophia Loren.
  Marilyn Monroe was even buried in the brand. And now, more than 30 years after
  his death, Pucci’s trademark vibrant swirly prints are enjoying another
  fashion moment. The return of Pucci has been bubbling up through content
  creators on TikTok, and the brand has the endorsement of Gen Z favourite
  Hailey Bieber. But it was confirmed this week when Lyst, the fashion data
  experts, revealed that searches for the brand had increased 96% in the second
  quarter of the year. Two of the classic prints – the pink Marmo from 1968 and
  the Orchidee from 1966 – were particularly popular, on minidresses and
  handkerchief tops. While not everyone can afford the prices of new Pucci – a
  Orchidee minidress is £645 – Depop also report a rise in secondhand: searches
  are up 381% since January on the resale app. And there are Pucci-like prints
  on fast fashion sites such as Shein and Asos for as little as £14.51. Pucci’s
  popularity is about more than irresistible bright prints. It signposts a
  change in mood. Katy Lubin, the vice-president of brand and communications at
  Lyst, says: “It’s been years of this quite serious, quite luxury, minimal,
  intellectual fashion, or just quite plain and neutral-y fashion. It’s exciting
  to see something that feels colourful and fun and fresh – especially during
  summertime.” The season is another factor. On social media, videos showing
  Pucci often feature the hashtag #puccigirl or #puccisummer – one Vogue writer
  reported in April: “The Pucci woman is taking over my summer moodboard”. The
  trend is an offshoot of a wider aesthetic called “Euro summer”, which
  highlights the props that represent a starter pack of summer on the continent
  – from tomatoes and pasta, to white walls and blue sea. It seems Italian
  brands with print and colour are part of this, too. Lubin says there is also
  renewed interest in Missoni, Versace and Roberto Cavalli, but describes Pucci
  as “the hero brand”. This status is down to Pucci’s history – and its
  association with jet-set holidays. The label was founded by Pucci, a marchese
  who grew up in a palace in Florence. He launched his brand in the 1940s and
  opened a boutique in Capri in 1950. In the 50s and 60s, Taylor and others
  began wearing the designs on holiday. Now, says a Depop spokesperson, “the
  brand’s psychedelic prints [are] synonymous with Italian glamour and vintage
  style”. Camille Miceli has been the creative director of Pucci since 2021, and
  she has doubled down on this heritage. Speaking not long after her
  appointment, she said: “Pucci isn’t a conceptual brand, it’s a lifestyle
  brand, so its message has to be direct.” This message has been clearly
  signposted by the staging of the brand’s shows – the most recent took place in
  Portofino, another upscale Italian holiday destination. It’s a move that helps
  the brand appeal both to the wealthy women that go to such locations, and
  those who aspire to do so. Pucci’s prints might not be a monogram but the fact
  they are so recognisable means they still work to show the wearer’s wealth.
  Depop’s spokesperson argues this points to the return of “a more maximalist
  style of dressing – [it’s] less brash than the logomania of the 2010s but
  still gives instant ‘if you know, you know’ cues to other fashion insiders”.
  Lubin, meanwhile, describes the prints as “the equivalent to the logo to be
  seen in this summer”. As a brand so associated with the summer season, what
  are the chances that these prints will still be seen as autumn arrives? If
  minidresses and handkerchief tops might make an exit, Lubin says silk scarves
  will remain: “That could be one way we will see Pucci beyond the beach.”
