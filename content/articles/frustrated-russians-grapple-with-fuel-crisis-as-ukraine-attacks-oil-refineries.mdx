  Russia prides itself on being an energy superpower, but some of its citizens
  are suddenly struggling to fill their fuel tanks after weeks of Ukrainian
  drone strikes crippled refining capacity across the country. Petrol stations
  in several regions have run dry while prices have surged to record highs and
  motorists queue for hours. Over the summer, Kyiv has stepped up its drone
  campaign against Russia’s energy infrastructure, a strategy designed to put
  pressure on Moscow and to signal that Ukraine still holds leverage in the
  peace talks led by the US president, Donald Trump. Fuel shortages are being
  felt most acutely in remote regions, including the far east, southern Russia
  and the annexed Crimean peninsula, where motorists have been forced to switch
  to more expensive grades because of shortages of regular A-95 petrol. Analysts
  estimate that Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russian oil refineries have
  disrupted at least 17% of all of Russia’s refining capacity, an equivalent of
  1.1m barrels a day. Between 2 and 24 August, Ukraine carried out at least a
  dozen strikes on Russian oil infrastructure, according to media reports, with
  the majority hitting facilities along the Ryazan–Volgograd corridor in the
  country’s south-west. The latest attack came on Wednesday, when Ukrainian
  media reported that a powerful explosion struck the Ryazan–Moscow oil
  pipeline, one of the main arteries supplying fuel to the capital. “This is not
  the first fuel crisis; it has happened several times before the war,” said
  Boris Aronstein, an independent oil and gas analyst. But, Aronstein said,
  Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries and storage facilities had made this the
  most severe crisis in recent years. “The attacks are massive, coordinated, and
  repeated; they come in waves, and the refineries simply do not have time to
  repair the damage caused by the previous attack before the next one occurs,”
  Aronstein added. Wholesale prices for A-95 – Russia’s most widely used petrol
  – hit record highs last week, climbing to about 82,300 roubles (£760) a tonne,
  almost 54% higher than in January. At first glance, fuel shortages inside
  Russia jar with its status as one of the world’s top energy exporters,
  shipping crude to markets such as China and India. Trump this week imposed
  sweeping tariffs on US imports from India, citing Delhi’s reliance on
  discounted Russian oil. But crude oil has to be processed into petrol and
  diesel, and much of Russia’s refining system is geared toward export products.
  Analysts say one of the industry’s main weaknesses is the lack of any real
  buffer in domestic petrol production. Output only just covers domestic demand,
  leaving the system highly vulnerable to disruption. And while drone strikes
  usually disable only part of a refinery’s capacity, sanctions have cut off
  Russia from western technology, making repairs slower and more complicated.
  Even before the most recent attacks, Moscow had moved to tighten its gasoline
  export ban in July to cope with a surge in domestic demand. Russian social
  media has been flooded with clips of frustrated motorists complaining about
  shortages and soaring prices. “We’ve been waiting for hours, and no one knows
  if we’ll even get our cars filled,” said one man as he drove past a snaking
  queue in the far-eastern city of Dalnegorsk. The Motorist’s Den, a popular
  Russian car channel on Telegram, quipped that “it feels like petrol will soon
  be poured into champagne glasses rather than fuel tanks”. Another widely
  shared post joked: “Filling up now is almost like a trip to a boutique: you
  set out for a litre, and return with an empty wallet and the philosophical
  thought that maybe walking isn’t so bad after all.” The current crisis has
  been sharpened by timing: August is traditionally the toughest month for
  Russia’s fuel market, when the harvest season pushes up demand, refineries
  undergo scheduled maintenance and exporters chase higher seasonal prices
  abroad. What is usually a predictable squeeze has this year tipped into a
  full-blown shortage after Ukrainian drones knocked out key facilities. Crimea,
  annexed by Russia in 2014, has been among the hardest hit. The peninsula,
  which usually hosts a flood of Russian holidaymakers in the summer, has had
  its airports shut because of the drone threat, forcing visitors on to roads
  and piling further pressure on already scarce supplies. Officials have urged
  calm. The Kremlin-appointed head of Crimea asked residents “to understand the
  restrictions on 95-octane petrol”, warning that the situation could drag on
  for another month. “All possible measures to stabilise prices are now being
  taken both by the federal government and by us,” he said. While the shortages
  are disruptive and politically awkward for the Kremlin, analysts caution they
  are unlikely for now to derail Russia’s war effort or heavy industry. Much of
  the country’s industrial fleet and military equipment runs on diesel rather
  than petrol, and Russia still has a surplus of it. “There is still a long way
  to go before the transport, agriculture and industrial sectors – or, most
  importantly, the army – experience any significant fuel shortages,” said
  Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, who
  previously worked at the Russian oil major Gazprom. Still, with Ukraine
  showing no sign of slowing its drone campaign, economists say that the fuel
  squeeze could drag on well into the winter. If the worst comes to the worst,
  Vakulenko said, authorities could be forced to resort to gasoline rationing.
