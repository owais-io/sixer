  A dispute over the dismissal of Susan Monarez, director of the US Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has intensified, with her attorneys
  asserting she will not leave unless the president himself takes action.
  Monarez was officially removed late on Wednesday following a heated exchange
  in which the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, attempted to oust her,
  according to the White House. Her lawyer has countered that Monarez has no
  intention of resigning. As she was confirmed by the Senate, unlike previous
  CDC directors, Monarez technically serves at the will of the president, so
  Kennedy alone may not have had the authority to terminate her. Monarez, an
  infectious disease expert, was sworn in just a month ago by Kennedy but soon
  found herself at odds with him over vaccine policy, according to individuals
  familiar with the matter. In the wake of her removal, four senior CDC leaders
  abruptly resigned, apparently out of frustration with Kennedy’s approach to
  vaccines and his management style. Here’s a breakdown of the CDC leaders
  involved. Susan Monarez Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  Monarez is a microbiologist with bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees
  from the University of Wisconsin. She joined the CDC as principal deputy
  director in January 2025, briefly served as acting director, and was confirmed
  by the Senate as the agency’s 21st director on 31 July. She became the first
  director without a medical degree and the first confirmed under a 2023 law. On
  27 August, she was dismissed over conflicts about vaccine policy, a move her
  legal team has argued was improper because only the president has the
  authority to remove her. Debra Houry Former chief medical officer and deputy
  director for program and science at the CDC Houry, a physician with degrees
  from Emory University and Tulane University, previously worked as an emergency
  doctor and at various facilities in Atlanta, as well as serving in academic
  leadership roles. At the CDC, she served as chief medical officer and deputy
  director for program and science. She resigned in late August 2025 following
  Monarez’s removal, citing the spread of vaccine misinformation, looming budget
  reductions and political meddling that she said undermined the agency’s
  mission. Demetre Daskalakis Former director of the National Center for
  Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC Daskalakis, a public health
  physician known for his leadership in HIV prevention and vaccination programs,
  led the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. He
  received his medical degree from the NYU School of Medicine and completed
  postgraduate medical training at Harvard Medical School in 2003, before
  joining the CDC in 2020 as director of the division of HIV/Aids Prevention. He
  resigned from the CDC on 28 August, publishing a letter that denounced
  political interference, data manipulation and what he called a decline in
  scientific integrity. Daniel Jernigan Former director of the National Center
  for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the CDC Jernigan, a longtime
  CDC official, directed the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic
  Infectious Diseases and played a key role in influenza and pandemic
  preparedness. Jernigan first joined the CDC’s epidemic intelligence service in
  1994 and worked in the respiratory diseases branch on the prevention and
  control of bacterial respiratory pathogens. He left his position in August
  2025 after Monarez’s ouster, joining other top officials in objecting to what
  they saw as the politicization of science and diminished trust in the agency’s
  leadership. Jennifer Layden Former director of office of public health data,
  science, technology at the CDC Layden, who led the office of public health
  data, surveillance, and technology at the CDC, focused on modernizing outbreak
  tracking and response systems. Layden received both her doctor of medicine and
  her doctorate in epidemiology from the University of Illinois at Chicago.
  Formerly Illinois’ chief medical officer, she also resigned after Monarez’s
  removal in August 2025, warning about the damaging effects of political
  influence on science-based decision-making.
