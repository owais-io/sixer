  As a finale to the first half of the season, Formula One could not have asked
  for a better send-off than the Hungarian Grand Prix, a race which sets up the
  championship run-in after the forthcoming summer break to perfection. The two
  title protagonists and McLaren teammates, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, were
  wheel to wheel to the flag, with Norris emerging on top after a nerveless
  denouement that suggests the championship too will go down to the wire. For
  all that this was a contest made by an adroit and opportune strategy call for
  Norris, it also delivered a fiercely competitive head to head between the
  British driver and Piastri. As the Australian chased down his rival at the
  death it was the season writ large. On the penultimate lap he threw his
  McLaren up the inside of turn one in a desperate bid for the lead. His wheels
  locked up and the Hungaroring took an enormous collective inhalation as his
  nose drifted almost in slow motion towards Norris’s car. They barely missed
  one another and were through turns two and three before breathing resumed with
  an appreciative roar. It was a mighty effort but Norris was equally nerveless
  to see it off. He closed out with a precision and steely determination just
  seven-tenths of a second in front, a reminder that he is very much in this
  title fight. Indeed after 14 rounds, as McLaren secured another one-two and
  their 200th race win, Piastri’s lead over his teammate is down to just nine
  points. Relations between the two drivers remain solid and friendly, an almost
  unheard of feat in teammate rivals vying for a championship, and yet both
  repeatedly attest to it and it is manifestly true – a lack of drama and needle
  that many miss but which in no way diminishes how important the title is to
  both drivers. Norris was ecstatic with the win while Piastri, who had felt his
  shot at victory slipping away when McLaren switched to a one-stop strategy for
  Norris, was clearly disappointed. When his engineer Tom Stallard attempted to
  soften the blow by reminding him he still led the championship it was cold
  comfort, met with a stony silence. Norris’s unlikely victory had stemmed from
  that strategy call when the team switched from a planned two‑stop. Indeed the
  team principal, Andrea Stella, revealed afterwards that they had not believed
  a one-stop was even possible. But after Norris had gone backwards at the start
  he had nothing to lose and agreed to roll the dice with what felt like a
  resigned flippancy in the moment of: “Yeah why not.” It proved inspired. As
  Piastri, and George Russell and Charles Leclerc – who finished third and
  fourth respectively – had to stop again, Norris had the track position and the
  lead. He had to manage his tyres to the close and maintain enough pace to keep
  Piastri behind and with steely precision he did so by the skin of his teeth.
  It was an immense effort and it showed. “I’m dead, it was tough,” he said. “We
  weren’t really planning on a one-stop at the beginning but after the first lap
  it was kind of our only option to get back into things. It was tough in the
  final stint with Oscar catching. I was pushing flat out.” F1 can present a
  thriller of a spectacle or, as it likes to rather grandly refer to as a
  gladiatorial contest just as it can on occasion be a dour affair, a
  procession. However, for some time the race at the Hungaroring looked a little
  like the latter might be the case. Leclerc had led from pole ahead of Piastri
  but Norris found himself baulked up the inside of turn one, had to back off
  and dropped to fifth. It changed the face of the race, if inadvertently and
  not immediately. Indeed, Leclerc had looked in solid control for the best part
  of 40 laps when he and Piastri were racing each other, having considered
  Norris no longer part of the equation. But fortune too was to play its part.
  Leclerc’s balance inexplicably fell away and he was passed by Piastri and
  Russell in short order. He remonstrated with his team but it appears he had
  picked up damage that was to blame, letting Ferrari off the hook for the
  rocket he had been furiously preparing in the cockpit. Leclerc out of
  contention, then there were two. The title fight in microcosm as the race hung
  in the balance. When Piastri passed Leclerc he was nine seconds behind Norris
  with 19 laps remaining, and the gap came down as did the laps. They were line
  astern with four laps to go in a straight fight for that glorious finale where
  Norris won out. The summer break will be welcomed but both drivers doubtless
  cannot wait to fight it out again. A mouthwatering prospect. After a trying
  weekend including qualifying in 12th after which he described his driving as
  “absolutely useless”, Lewis Hamilton could manage to also finish only 12th for
  Ferrari. While Max Verstappen was similarly disappointed with ninth, having
  been cleared after an investigation when he appeared to have forced Hamilton
  wide off the track. Fernando Alonso was fifth and Lance Stroll seventh for
  Aston Martin, Gabriel Bortoleto was sixth for Sauber, Liam Lawson eighth for
  Racing Bulls and Kimi Antonelli 10th for Mercedes.
