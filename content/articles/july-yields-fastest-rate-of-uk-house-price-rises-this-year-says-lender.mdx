  UK house prices rose at the fastest monthly rate this year in July as mortgage
  rates eased and banks offered bigger home loans, according to the lender
  Halifax. The average property price grew by 0.4% in July to £298,237, Halifax
  found, ahead of an expected 0.3% rise. Cheaper mortgage rates and rising wages
  have helped to revive the property market, the lender said. The figures were
  released as the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee voted to cut base
  rates by a quarter point to 4%. Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at
  Halifax, said falling mortgage rates, combined with banks’ more flexible
  affordability assessments, had resulted in “a housing market that continues to
  show resilience, with activity levels holding up well. “We expect house prices
  to follow a steady path of modest gains through the rest of the year.” She
  said in the second half of the year there would be a rise in homeowners coming
  to the end of their fixed-rate deals taken out during the pandemic when the
  base rate was as low as 0.1%. “While most borrowers coming to the end of
  five-year, fixed-rate mortgage deals will see their monthly repayments rise,
  the extent of this will vary across households,” she said. “Those coming off a
  two-year fixed rate are very likely to see their monthly payments come down,
  as they originally locked in rates during the peak that followed the 2022
  mini-budget. “We’re unlikely to see a significant impact on house prices, but
  it may influence market dynamics if prospective home movers choose to delay
  plans as a result of tighter budgets.” Richard Donnell, the executive director
  at the property portal Zoopla, said the rate cut was unlikely to make a big
  difference to the cost of mortgages for homebuyers. “The price of fixed-rate
  mortgages already factors in the future path of base rates meaning average
  mortgage rates are likely to remain broadly where they are today,” he said.
  The average two-year, fixed rate for a buyer with a 20% deposit is now 4.4%,
  compared with 5.2% this time last year, according to analysis by the rival
  portal Rightmove. Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at Knight
  Frank, said the modest growth in house prices in July suggested the market was
  “getting back on its feet” after disruption during “April’s stamp duty
  cliff-edge”. Temporary stamp duty cuts in England and Northern Ireland ended
  in April, adding thousands of pounds to the cost of many transactions.
  Separate figures from Nationwide last week found that house prices rose by
  0.6% in July to an average of £272,664. Halifax found that in Northern
  Ireland, average house prices rose by 9.3% in the past year to £214,832, the
  strongest rate across the UK. Scotland also reported a 4.7% growth in July to
  £215,238, while in Wales prices rose by 2.7% to an average of £227,928.
