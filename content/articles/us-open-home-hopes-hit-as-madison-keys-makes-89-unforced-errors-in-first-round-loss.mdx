  One of the main home hopes at the US Open has suffered an early exit from the
  tournament after Madison Keys lost in the first round on Monday. There were
  early signs the world No 6, who won the Australian Open in January, faced a
  tough match against Mexico’s Renata Zarazúa. The American won the first set,
  but only after taking a marathon tiebreak 12-10. Zarazúa won the second set on
  another tiebreak (7-3) before closing out the match by taking the final set
  7-5. It was an error-strewn performance from Keys, who reached the US Open
  final in 2017, and she sent down 14 double faults and only got 55% of her
  first serves in. Keys, whose left thigh was heavily taped, also hit 46 winners
  to her opponent’s five, but had 89 unforced errors. “I feel like today, for
  the first time in a while, my nerves really got the better of me, and it kind
  of became a little bit paralysing,” said Keys. “I want to win, but just
  feeling like winning matters just way too much, and I just couldn’t quite
  separate myself from that. Then once you start playing badly, it just kind of
  all snowballs.” Zarazúa, the world No 82, has a modest record on tour, has
  never advanced past the second round of a major and had a 0-6 record against
  Top 10 players coming into Monday’s match. “I’m a little bit small in height,
  so coming in here, it was like: ‘Oh, my God. This is huge,’” said the 5ft 3in
  Zarazua. “When I retire, I’m going to be really happy about it, so I was like:
  ‘Just enjoy it.’” There were other defeats for American players on Monday.
  Coleman Wong became the first player from Hong Kong to win a grand slam men’s
  singles match since the Open era began in 1968 when he defeated Aleksander
  Kovacevic in straight sets. The 21-year-old is ranked 173rd on the ATP Tour
  and was making his main draw Grand Slam debut. He had fallen short in
  qualifying at Flushing Meadows, the Australian Open and twice apiece at
  Wimbledon and the French Open. Meanwhile, Sebastian Korda was forced to
  withdraw from his match against Britain’s Cameron Norrie while trailing 7-5,
  6-4.
