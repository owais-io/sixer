  One of the pleasures of the BBC Proms is that they bring some of classical
  music’s biggest names from around the world to the Royal Albert Hall. But
  celebrity is always relative – and, for better or worse, most Proms artists
  don’t also headline stadium gigs. But Japanese composer and conductor Joe
  Hisaishi does and, at 74, is a Proms debut artist like no other. He came on
  stage to waves of screaming and phones brandished to capture the moment. Never
  heard of him? You’re probably not part of the vast fanbase of the “cultural
  phenomenon” Studio Ghibli. Hisaishi is the John Williams of anime, responsible
  for the music in global hits from My Neighbour Totoro to The Boy and the
  Heron. The European premiere of Hisaishi’s symphonic suite from the latter
  opened this Prom, with the composer switching between his own soulful piano
  part and conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Quacking produced by
  brass mouthpieces provoked giggles and the orchestra luxuriated in the
  expansive majesty of Hisaishi’s scoring. But this remained a short concert
  recap of one of Hisaishi’s blandest film scores. Hisaishi’s suite The End of
  the World (another European premiere) was more ambitious. There were hints of
  Stravinsky, strictly atonal lyricism and big band jazz alongside symphonic
  landscaping that marshalled the RPO, BBC Singers and Philharmonia Chorus into
  sweeping waves of sound, all colourful post-minimalism topped by frothing
  strings. Countertenor John Holiday did double duty with a starkly beautiful
  solo in the central movement and a final, crooning rendition of Skeeter
  Davis’s 1960s pop number The End of the World, stratospheric violins providing
  eerie “wrong” notes that soured an otherwise saccharine texture. In a flash of
  inspired programming, Steve Reich’s The Desert Music followed, led with
  tireless concentration by Hisaishi. This is epic minimalism, demanding immense
  stamina from the performers to sustain Reich’s vibrantly pulsing texture for
  50 minutes. Two percussionists were allocated page turners, such is the
  score’s relentlessness. The BBC Singers and National Youth Voices – lightly
  amplified, as Reich demands – produced a remarkable, studio-mixed choral
  blend, while the RPO’s labour-intensive loops and licks were intricately
  moreish, the slow-spun fabric utterly hypnotic. • Listen again on BBC Sounds
  until 12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September
