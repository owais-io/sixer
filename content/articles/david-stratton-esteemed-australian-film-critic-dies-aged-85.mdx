  David Stratton, the revered Australian film critic and beloved co-host of
  television programs The Movie Show and At The Movies with fellow critic
  Margaret Pomeranz, has died aged 85. Stratton died in hospital near his home
  in the Blue Mountains, his family confirmed in a statement to the ABC.
  “David’s passion for film, commitment to Australian cinema, and generous
  spirit touched countless lives,” the family statement read. “He was adored as
  a husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and admired friend. “David’s
  family would like to express their heartfelt gratitude for the overwhelming
  support from friends, colleagues, and the public recently and across his
  lifetime,” they continued, inviting the public to “celebrate David’s
  remarkable life and legacy by watching their favourite movie, or David’s
  favourite movie of all time – Singin’ in the Rain.” “With dry humour and sharp
  insight, David Stratton shared his love of film with our country,” Australian
  prime minister Anthony Albanese wrote on X. “All of us who tuned in to At the
  Movies respected him for his deep knowledge and for the gentle and generous
  way he passed it on. May he rest in peace.” Born in the English town of
  Trowbridge in 1939, Stratton was sent to live with his grandmother in
  Hampshire during the second world war. An avid filmgoer, she took Stratton to
  the cinema almost every day, which changed his life. In the 2017 documentary
  David Stratton: A Cinematic Life, Stratton said he watched “at least one” film
  he hadn’t seen every day, and had seen more than 25,000 films in his life.
  Stratton moved to Australia in 1963, and was soon involved with the local film
  industry, becoming director of the Sydney film festival from 1966 until 1983.
  The role sealed his decision to stay in Australia; he later spoke of feeling
  “very guilty” about the decision, as it meant ending his family’s tradition of
  passing down the family’s grocery story in England from father to son since
  the 1820s. He became an Australian citizen in the 1980s. In 2014, it was
  revealed Stratton was under surveillance by the Australian Security
  Intelligence Organisation while he was director of the Sydney film festival,
  due to a visit he made to the USSR in the late 1960s and his decision to show
  Soviet films. On Thursday, Sydney film festival paid tribute to its former
  director, saying: “[This festival], and by extension the very culture of
  cinema in Australia, would not exist as it does today without the remarkable
  passion and devotion of David Stratton.” From the 1970s onwards, Stratton
  wrote reviews for The Australian, and Variety magazine in the US. In 1980, he
  joined SBS as a film consultant, introducing movies shown on the channel for
  six months a year. In that role he met TV producer Margaret Pomeranz;
  reflecting on their partnership in 2011, Pomeranz recalled wanting to make the
  strait-laced Stratton “take his tie off and grow a pony tail”. After they
  successfully pitched a weekly film review program to SBS, and several
  disappointing screen tests with female presenters, Stratton persuaded Pomeranz
  to join him on camera. In 1986, they began presenting the long-running SBS
  program The Movie Show. Their tastes were diverse, and often amusingly
  contrasted; Pomeranz’s open fondness for Hollywood action and mainstream
  blockbusters was stark against Stratton’s distaste for the same, often
  reserving his admiration for more obscure European cinema. In 1992, Pomeranz
  rated Romper Stomper five stars, while Stratton refused to give it a rating
  because he disliked it so. The film’s director, Geoffrey Wright, later threw a
  glass of wine in Stratton’s face. SBS managing director James Taylor said the
  broadcast was “deeply saddened” by Stratton’s death, and credited his work
  cohosting The Movie Show between 1986 and 2004 for “introducing generations of
  viewers to cinema from Australia and around the world. His legacy endures in
  every thoughtful review and every inspired viewer.” Stratton and Pomeranz left
  SBS in 2004, and took the concept to the ABC, with the show renamed At the
  Movies. The much-loved show ended in 2014 after almost three decades; when it
  ended, actor Geoffrey Rush lauded the pair’s “sparkling bickering”. After the
  success of At the Movies, Stratton appeared on several ABC shows as a snobbish
  parody of himself, including on The Chaser’s War on Everything, Review with
  Myles Barlow and Lawrence Leung’s Choose Your Own Adventure. He was highly
  regarded around the world for his knowledge of international cinema,
  particularly the French New Wave – he was a fan of François Truffaut, Jean-Luc
  Godard, Claude Chabrol and Jacques Demy – and for his work championing
  Australian cinema abroad. He served as a member of the International Jury at
  the film festivals of Berlin (1982), Montreal (1982) and Venice (1994), and
  was the president of FIPRESCI (International Federation of Film Critics)
  juries in Cannes twice and once in Venice. In 2001, Stratton was appointed the
  Croix de Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the French honour’s
  highest rank, for his services to French cinema. That same year, he received a
  lifetime achievement award from the Australian Film Institute, and a Centenary
  Medal for his “service to Australian society and Australian film production”.
  In 2015, he was made a member of the Order of Australia. In the 2012 Sight
  &amp; Sound critics’ poll, Stratton named his 10 favourite films as Charulata,
  Citizen Kane, The Conversation, Uzak (Distant), Distant Voices, Still Lives,
  Kings of the Road, Lola, The Searchers, Singin’ in the Rain, and The
  Travelling Players. In 2008 he released an autobiography titled I Peed on
  Fellini, named for his drunken attempt to shake director Federico Fellini’s
  hand while at a urinal. In 2021, he published My Favourite Movies, a book that
  explored his relationship with 111 films. In 2024 he published his final book:
  Australia at the Movies, compiling about 650 reviews of every locally produced
  feature made between 1990 and 2020. His publisher Allen &amp; Unwin said
  called Australia at the Movies his “magnum opus” and saying he would be “best
  remembered for the 28 years he co-hosted movie shows on SBS and ABC TV as yang
  to Margaret Pomeranz’s yin. Who could forget David’s cool, measured tone in
  response to Margaret’s passion?” In 2023 Stratton retired from writing
  criticism and teaching, telling Guardian Australia of his retirement plans:
  “I’d like to watch one new movie every day that I haven’t seen before. And
  from time to time watch an old movie that I want to see again.”
