  ‘Middle East on Fire: Israel positions tanks on Gaza border.” Journalist
  Phoebe Greenwood’s debut novel follows Sara Byrne, a freelance journalist in
  Gaza in 2012, who is reporting for a “pretty rightwing” British newspaper.
  Staying at the Beach Hotel, which is occupied exclusively by “middle-aged
  foreign correspondents”, she jostles with other reporters for stories while
  maintaining less-than-cordial relations with her fixer, Nasser. It could
  almost be a comedy of manners, with sketches of staff members and scenes from
  the hotel lobby. But it isn’t because, as the hotel owner puts it, “Gaza is a
  prison in non-stop war”. Vulture is a caustic study of what it means to report
  from a conflict, and particularly relevant to the current moment. It’s a
  knowing portrait by Greenwood, who was a freelance reporter in Jerusalem
  between 2010 and 2013, and later a foreign affairs correspondent at this
  newspaper. Her antiheroine visits a morgue, where the bodies of children,
  “dusted in sand and blood”, wear torn Spider-Man pyjamas. She narrowly escapes
  a bombed hospital, which is “running out of anaesthetic and even basic
  painkillers”. Still, her editor requires stories, and so – oblivious to the
  personal toll on Nasser – she pursues increasingly dangerous lines of inquiry.
  None of the other journalists has “stepped foot near a terror tunnel”,
  Greenwood tells us, so we follow Byrne in pursuit of this exclusive.
  Meanwhile, a photographer is killed, and she befriends a strange, hostile
  child, all the while witnessing scene after scene of unimaginable destruction.
  The title of the book is testament to its wry tone, and ultimately its
  position. In Byrne, Greenwood has created a particularly acerbic character,
  reluctant or perhaps unable to offer sincere emotions in the face of
  horrifying events. Her battle-weary sense of humour, however, cannot last, and
  Byrne’s mental state becomes increasingly unstable. She believes a bird –
  identified as a pigeon, but described more like a vulture – is tormenting her.
  Her eyes are yellow; she winces with pain when she walks. Greenwood handles
  this descent well; the narration remains jocular, even arrogant, meaning it
  never feels hackneyed. A brief foray into newsroom pressures and expectations
  is lightly handled, but Greenwood punctures it succinctly. As a bereaved
  mother says to Byrne: “You come, you watch us die, watch us grieve, take our
  stories, go home. Do you help? No. My husband cleans your sheets, you kill his
  family.” It is a stark rebuttal to Byrne’s self-pity. Occasionally,
  Greenwood’s creative writing feels less successful than the news writing
  within it: the protagonist’s filed copy is sometimes clearer than the prose
  itself. But Vulture remains a remarkably skilful debut. Greenwood’s style is
  compelling and blackly comic; the story could not be more serious. • Vulture
