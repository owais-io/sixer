  Harry Maguire has hinted at a desire to sign a new contract at Manchester
  United when his current deal expires next summer, though discussions regarding
  the defender’s future are yet to occur. United triggered a one-year extension
  in his terms in January. “I’m sure over the next few months we’ll have a
  conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend,” the
  32-year-old said. “I have something in my mind about what I want to do. I
  don’t want to put it out there [publicly], but it’s an amazing club to play
  for and you’d be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could. I
  think there were a couple of clubs who enquired or spoke with them [the club]
  and I think they got a quick response.” Despite United opening the new season
  with a 1-0 loss to Arsenal, Maguire believes they are in a better position
  than when he joined them from Leicester for £80m in August 2019. “We’re in a
  good place, positive as a club and I feel like the hierarchy has come in and
  Jason [Wilcox, director of football] and the manager – they’re taking it in
  the right direction,” he said. “Since I started six years ago to where it is
  now, it’s in a completely different place in terms of the structure behind the
  management staff.” Maguire, who was speaking at the Manchester United
  Foundation Camp in Stretford, did not start in Sunday’s defeat at Old
  Trafford. Matthijs de Ligt was preferredas the middle centre-back in Ruben
  Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation, although he did come on in the 80th minute for Luke
  Shaw. “Me and Matthijs have been playing that central role, but also we can
  play either side in the back three,” Maguire said. “I’ve proven that. I’ve
  done that for England and Mattias has done that numerous times for the
  Netherlands as well. There’s competition for places all over the pitch and
  that’s healthy in the squad. “I feel in a good place. It’s been a couple of
  years now where I feel like I’ve played really well for this club again.”
  Meanwhile, United have announced the appointment of Stephen Torpey as the
  club’s new academy director. Torpey joins from Brentford, where he led the
  rebuilding of the club’s youth structure.
