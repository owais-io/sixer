  A respected fisher who met King Charles and government representatives to
  discuss the future of the industry has been jailed for taking part in a
  sophisticated plot to smuggle £18m of cocaine into the UK. Peter Williams, 44,
  was sentenced to 16 years and nine months for captaining a boat that went out
  to pick up packages of cocaine dropped into the sea off Cornwall by a “mother
  ship” transporting the drugs from South America. Truro crown court was told
  that Williams, from Havant, Hampshire, had been an upstanding member of his
  local community but after falling on hard times developed a drug habit and
  accrued a large debt. He was recruited by his drug dealers to skipper the
  rigid-hull inflatable boat (RHIB) for the drug-smuggling operation in
  September last year but it went wrong when it was spotted by a UK Border Force
  cutter. The fisher led Border Force officers on a 28-mile chase, which ended
  on Gwynver beach near Land’s End when Williams ran the RHIB aground. He and
  other members of the gang, which included three Essex men believed to have
  been aiming to sell the drugs in the south-east of England, and a Colombian
  man thought to have been acting as security for the South American drug
  cartel, were caught. In mitigation, Williams’ barrister, Harry Laidlaw, said
  he had been a fisher for about 15 years, having previously worked with
  children in the care sector. The barrister said his problems began almost 20
  years ago when his father, also a fisher, died in his presence on a boat. “His
  response to that was to turn to drugs, cocaine in particular,” said Laidlaw.
  “He sorted out his addiction to a degree and managed to get his life back on
  track. In 2020 his marriage began to break down. Covid struck his business and
  he fell back into the same trap.” Laidlaw said Williams had been left with
  “significant debt”, relating to his business problems and his drug habit, and
  was approached by his dealers to become involved in the plot. The barrister
  said it had been a “massive fall from grace”. He said: “He was a decent,
  upstanding member of the local coastal community. He represented fishermen for
  years in front of government and meeting the king in that capacity. “He worked
  for a charity called Fishing into the Future. He was vice-chair of that
  charity.” Laidlaw said he met the king – when he was Prince of Wales – on a
  number of occasions through the charity, speaking to him at length about
  sustainable fishing and getting young people involved in the industry. “He has
  made a terrible series of decisions,” Laidlaw said. Sentencing Williams, Judge
  Adkin said: “This was an international conspiracy to smuggle a large quantity
  of cocaine into the UK.” He said Williams was a “trusted gang member”. Earlier
  this month, the Guardian revealed that law enforcement agencies had urged
  people living in coastal communities in the UK to help them catch drug gangs.
  They have warned that gangs are favouring a method called “at-sea drop-offs”
  (Asdos) in which packages of drugs are released into the ocean from “mother
  ships” for smaller vessels to pick up and take into the UK via small coves and
  harbours. There is growing concern the gangs may begin to use more
  sophisticated techniques such as deploying underwater drones, nicknamed narco
  submarines, to evade Border Force cutters. Williams admitted conspiracy to
  import class A drugs. Five other men have been sentenced over the same plot
  and one more is to be dealt with next month.
