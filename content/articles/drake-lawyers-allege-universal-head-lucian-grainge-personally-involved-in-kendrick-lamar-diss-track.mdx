  As Drake’s lawsuit continues against his record label’s parent company,
  Universal Music Group (UMG), his lawyers have claimed that UMG’s British chair
  and chief executive Lucian Grainge had a “role in and knowledge of the scheme
  to defame and harass” Drake, and have requested that UMG produce texts and
  emails by Grainge. UMG has previously denied access to those communications,
  stating that Grainge has “no meaningful involvement in the matters and
  decisions at issue in this litigation”. Drake is suing UMG over its release of
  Kendrick Lamar’s diss track Not Like Us, which contains the line “Say, Drake,
  I hear you like ’em young … Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles”. The
  track was hugely popular, reaching No 1 in the US and UK, and was performed at
  the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show. Its artwork features an image of Drake’s
  home dotted with icons used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders.
  Drake has strenuously denied the allegation that he is a paedophile. In his
  lawsuit filed in January, UMG is alleged to have “approved, published and
  launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track”, that was
  “intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation
  that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should
  resort to vigilante justice in response”. Drake is not suing Lamar himself.
  UMG said the suit was “utterly without merit” but in April, Drake’s lawyers
  added an amendment to the suit, arguing that the Super Bowl performance
  “further solidified the public’s belief in the truth of the allegations
  against Drake”. UMG said Drake was “being misled by his legal representatives
  into taking one absurd legal step after another”. On Tuesday, Drake’s lawyers
  filed two new motions in the case, calling on the judge in the case to compel
  UMG to “collect, review, and produce” relevant documents from Grainge,
  arguing: “UMG’s refusal to permit relevant discovery into its CEO’s files is
  unsupported by law and would prejudice plaintiff’s ability to test and prove
  his claims.” The motion argues that Drake “now also has reason to believe that
  Grainge was personally involved in decisions made regarding the marketing and
  promotion of [Not Like Us] around its release … Given that plaintiff has
  alleged Grainge to be one of the individuals at UMG who acted with actual
  malice, plaintiff is entitled to seek discovery into Grainge’s files for the
  purpose of proving Grainge’s actual malice”. A letter from UMG’s legal team to
  Drake’s in July, denying access to Grainge’s documents, reads: “UMG has
  maintained since our first meet and confer on this topic that Sir Lucian had
  no meaningful involvement in the matters and decisions at issue in this
  litigation. Sir Lucian runs a global multinational company; he is not involved
  in record releases or marketing activities around individual tracks, even
  high-profile ones.” It adds that “to the extent his documents and
  communications contain any (limited) relevant information, it is expected to
  be cumulative and duplicative” of other UMG staff communications that the
  company has agreed to make available. Lawyers for Drake claim UMG’s position
  has slightly changed from a previous claim of “no role in the matters”, to “no
  meaningful involvement”. The second motion from Drake’s team seeks a different
  set of documents, “related to UMG’s historical censorship” of artists, arguing
  that UMG has the right to censor works when they contain defamatory
  statements, and has previously exercised that right. It also argues that UMG
  encouraged competition between two of its labels: Republic, which releases
  Drake’s music, and Interscope, which releases Lamar’s. The specific allegation
  is “that the incentive structure for executives at UMG’s labels motivated UMG
  to defame Drake”. The motion requests various financial documents, as well as
  Lamar’s unredacted record contract. UMG has not commented on the newly filed
  motions. The Guardian has contacted the company’s legal team for comment. UMG
  is seeking to have the case dismissed, claiming in March that Drake “lost a
  rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated … diss
  tracks are a popular and celebrated artform centred around outrageous insults,
  and they would be severely chilled if Drake’s suit were permitted to proceed”.
