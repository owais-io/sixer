  Women should ensure they are getting enough omega fatty acids in their diets
  according to researchers, who found unusually low levels of the compounds in
  female patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The advice follows an analysis of
  blood samples from Alzheimer’s patients and healthy individuals, which
  revealed levels of unsaturated fats, such as those containing omega fatty
  acids, were up to 20% lower in women with the disease. The low levels were not
  seen in men with Alzheimer’s, suggesting there may be sex differences in how
  the disease takes hold and affects a person’s physiology. “The difference
  between the sexes was the most shocking and unexpected finding,” said Dr
  Cristina Legido-Quigley, a senior author on the study at King’s College London
  published in the Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia journal. “There’s an indication
  that having less of these compounds could be causal in Alzheimer’s, but we
  need a clinical trial to confirm that.” Alzheimer’s disease is twice as common
  in women as in men. Factors including women’s longer average lifespan,
  differences in hormones, immune responses and educational opportunities can
  all play a role in the development of the disease. In the latest study,
  researchers analysed the levels of lipids, which are fatty compounds, in the
  blood of 306 people with Alzheimer’s, 165 people with mild cognitive
  impairment and 370 people who were cognitively healthy controls. Lipids can be
  saturated or unsaturated, with the former generally considered unhealthy and
  the latter broadly healthy. Women with Alzheimer’s disease had higher levels
  of saturated lipids and lower levels of unsaturated lipids than cognitively
  healthy women, a pattern not seen in men. Legido-Quigley said that if changes
  in the liver or metabolism were responsible, less omega fatty acids would
  probably be reaching women’s brains. “And these lipids feed the brain,” she
  added. Diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as the Mediterranean diet, have
  long been linked to health benefits for the heart, brain and other organs. One
  study from 2022 found that middle-aged people with higher blood levels of
  omega-3 fatty acids had better cognitive function than others. Several trials
  have found that giving older people omega-3 supplements did not improve their
  cognitive function or boost mental capacity in those already diagnosed with
  dementia. Legido-Quigley wants to see a clinical trial established to test
  whether supplements can delay Alzheimer’s disease specifically in women with
  low levels of unsaturated fatty acids, adding that the drop may start to
  appear when women are in their 50s. In the meantime, she said women should
  ensure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diets. There are three
  essential omega-3 fatty acids, known as ALA, DHA and EPA. ALA is found in
  plant-based foods such as chia seeds, flaxseed and walnuts. DHA and EPA
  primarily come from fish. The NHS recommends eating two 140g servings of fish
  a week, with one being an oily fish, to get enough DHA and EPA. Dr Julia
  Dudley at Alzheimer’s Research UK, which co-funded the study, said more work
  was needed to unpick the mechanisms behind the sex difference and discover
  whether lifestyle changes, including diet, could have a role in preventing the
  disease. “Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help
  doctors tailor future treatments and health advice,” she added.
