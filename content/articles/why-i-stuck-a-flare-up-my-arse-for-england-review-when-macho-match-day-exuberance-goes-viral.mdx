  Football is coming home for Alex Hill’s one-man play for a third and final
  season on the fringe and you can see why it has proved such a hit. The setting
  is the delayed Euro 2020 tournament, the one in which Gareth Southgate’s
  England beat ancient rivals Germany, then Ukraine and Denmark before facing
  Italy at Wembley. For an obsessive fan such as Billy Kinley, someone who lives
  for football and its attendant culture of booze and thuggery, it is an
  excitement almost too great to bear. That is as close a reason as he can come
  up with for pulling down his shorts and shoving a flare between his bum cheeks
  on match day. It is an act of exuberance that turns him into a viral
  sensation. It also gives him cause to wonder how his life has reached such a
  place, especially now he has been abandoned by his childhood pal Adam and
  dumped by his previously tolerant girlfriend. If he knew the phrase toxic
  masculinity, he would have to use it; a once sweet-natured boy, he has traded
  his old stability for the camaraderie of the terraces and the excesses of
  drugs and violence. The flare is his way of belonging. Under the direction of
  Sean Turner, Hill plays Billy with gusto. In the working-class tradition of
  Steven Berkoff and John Godber, he gives a have-your-cake-and-eat-it
  performance that revels in macho exuberance even while it delivers a sobering
  message about communication breakdown. The details of that breakdown are
  slipped in teasingly. It feels like there is more to be said about Adam’s fate
  and the degree to which Billy should be held accountable for failing to listen
  to his friend. It is a boisterous play about boisterousness, one that will
  keep knocking in the goals for audiences, even if it says more about the
  thrill of the hooligan lifestyle than the emotional inarticulacy behind it. •
