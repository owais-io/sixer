  This is a take on the classic black forest gateau, with layers of delicate
  chocolate crepes, silky white chocolate cream and sour cherry jam. (Use a
  good-quality store-bought jam if making your own is a step too far.) All the
  components can be made ahead of time, ready to be assembled, but be aware that
  the finished cake needs to be refrigerated for at least three hours, and
  preferably overnight. Black forest crepe cake You can make the jam up to five
  days in advance. Store, covered, in the fridge. Prep 10 min Chill 4 hr+ Cook 1
  hr 30 min Serves 8-10 For the sour cherry jam 300g drained sour cherries (from
  a jar or frozen) 1 tbsp lemon juice 150g jam sugar (with pectin) 1 tbsp kirsch
  (optional) For the white chocolate cream 100g white chocolate, roughly chopped
  40g unsalted butter, soft but not oily 140g cream cheese 1 tbsp kirsch, or ¼
  tsp almond extract (optional but highly recommended) 140ml cold double cream
  For the crepes 125g plain flour 2 tbsp (16g) unsweetened cocoa powder, plus
  extra for dusting 1 tbsp icing sugar ¼ tsp fine sea salt 2 large eggs 330ml
  milk 1 tbsp melted unsalted butter, plus extra for cooking the crepes 1 tsp
  vanilla extract Put all the jam ingredients except the kirsch in a medium
  saucepan, place on a low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar
  dissolves. Increase the heat to medium, bring to a boil, then simmer gently
  for 10-15 minutes, until thick and syrupy – the timing will depend on how wide
  the pan is. Stir in the kirsch, if using, then transfer the jam to a small
  bowl and leave to cool. To make the white chocolate cream, put the white
  chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a small pan of
  simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted, then leave to cool to tepid.
  In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter with the paddle attachment on
  medium-high until smooth. Beat in the cream cheese, then pour in the melted
  chocolate and kirsch, if using, and mix until smooth. Add the cream, beat to
  soft peaks, then cover and chill for at least an hour (and up to two days). To
  make the crepes, sift the flour, cocoa, icing sugar and salt into a medium
  bowl. Make a well in the centre, crack in the eggs and whisk to break them up.
  Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to form a smooth batter, then beat
  in the melted butter and vanilla.(Alternatively, put everything in a blender
  or food processor and blitz smooth. You’ll need one large crepe (at least
  23cm) and 10 smaller ones (about 20cm). When ready to cook, set a large
  (25cm), nonstick crepe or frying pan on a medium heat. Add a little butter
  (about a quarter-teaspoon) and swirl it around with a piece of kitchen paper.
  Pour in 80ml of the batter and swirl to get a thin, even layer. Cook for about
  a minute, then flip and cook the other side until lightly golden. Transfer to
  a plate. Swap to a smaller (20cm) nonstick crepe or frying pan and heat well.
  Repeat the above process to make 10 smaller crepes, adding a swipe of butter
  and using a scant 60ml batter each time. Stack and cover the crepes as you go.
  To assemble, lay two long pieces of clingfilm perpendicular to each other on a
  worktop to form a large cross. Put the large crepe in the centre and spread a
  thin, even layer of white chocolate cream (about 80g) over the surface. Place
  a smaller crepe in the centre and spread with about 50g of cherry jam.
  Continue layering, alternating between 50g cream and 50g jam, finishing with a
  plain crepe on top. Once all the crepes are stacked, gently gather the edges
  of clingfilm up and over the cake, pulling firmly so the larger crepe curves
  up around the edges of the stack of small crepes. Twist the clingfilm tightly
  in the centre and secure with a clip, then transfer clip side up to a large
  pasta bowl or similar container to help hold its curved shape. Refrigerate for
  at least three hours, or overnight. To serve, unwrap and remove the clingfilm,
  invert the cake on to a serving plate so the seam is underneath and dust
  generously with cocoa powder.
