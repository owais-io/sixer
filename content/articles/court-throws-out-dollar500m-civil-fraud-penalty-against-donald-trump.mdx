  A New York appeals court has thrown out the massive civil fraud penalty
  against Donald Trump, ruling on Thursday in the state’s lawsuit accusing him
  of exaggerating his wealth. The decision, which was not unanimous, came seven
  months after the Republican returned to the White House. A panel of five
  judges in New York’s mid-level appellate division said the verdict, which
  stood to cost Trump more than $515m and rock his real estate empire, was
  “excessive”. After finding that Trump engaged in fraud by flagrantly padding
  financial statements that went to lenders and insurers, judge Arthur Engoron
  ordered him last year to pay $355m in penalties. With interest, the sum has
  topped $515m. The total – combined with penalties levied on some other Trump
  Organization executives, including Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr – now
  exceeds $527m, with interest. “While the injunctive relief ordered by the
  court is well crafted to curb defendants’ business culture, the court’s
  disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion
  dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the
  Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,” judges Dianne T Renwick
  and Peter H Moulton wrote in one of several opinions shaping the appeals
  court’s ruling. Engoron had also barred Trump and his sons from corporate
  leadership roles for several years. Those restrictions were paused pending
  appeal, and Trump delayed payment by posting a $175m bond. The appeals court
  dismissed the financial penalty imposed by Engoron but left room for further
  appeals to the state’s highest court. The panel took nearly 11 months to issue
  its decision, far longer than is typical. Trump has denied wrongdoing, calling
  himself “an innocent man” and claiming the case was a “fraud on me”. He
  continues to argue that the lawsuit is politically motivated. In the aftermath
  of the ruling making headlines, Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a
  “great win for America”. In another post, he claimed: “these were all
  Political Trials in an effort to destroy my viability as a Presidential
  Candidate before, during, and after the Election.” He continued to claim that
  the Biden-Harris administration attacked him and that “all of these Judges
  should be ashamed of themselves for allowing them to happen.” Trump continued
  with another lengthy screed, calling the penalty “a Political Witch Hunt, in a
  business sense” and “a Case of Election Interference by the City and State
  trying to show, illegally, that I did things that were wrong when, in fact,
  everything I did was absolutely CORRECT and, even, PERFECT.” That same post
  also took aim at New York attorney general Letitia James and judges Juan
  Merchan and Lewis Kaplan. James, who brought the suit on the state’s behalf,
  has said the businessman turned politician engaged in “lying, cheating, and
  staggering fraud”. On Thursday afternoon, she released a statement saying she
  will be seeking an appeal. “The First Department today affirmed the
  well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two
  of his children are liable for fraud. The court upheld the injunctive relief
  we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers’ ability to
  do business in New York. It should not be lost to history: yet another court
  has ruled that the president violated the law and that our case has merit,”
  James’s statement read. Trump’s justice department has subpoenaed James for
  records related to the lawsuit, among other documents, as part of an
  investigation into whether she violated the president’s civil rights. James’s
  personal attorney, Abbe D Lowell, has said that investigating the fraud case
  is “the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out
  the president’s political retribution campaign”. Joining Trump in celebration
  was the former Trump lawyer Alina Habba, who called the ruling “a resounding
  victory for President Trump and his company”. “The court struck down the
  outrageous and unlawful $464 million penalty, confirming what we have said
  from the beginning: the Attorney General’s case was politically motivated,
  legally baseless, and grossly excessive,” Habba said on X. “President Trump
  won – and justice won with him.” Trump’s defense maintains his financial
  statements were not misleading, pointing to disclaimers and the fact that
  lenders were repaid. During an appellate court hearing in September, Trump’s
  lawyers argued that many of the case’s allegations were too old, an assertion
  they made unsuccessfully before trial. He also argued his reported assets were
  underestimated, despite discrepancies such as tripling the size of his Trump
  Tower penthouse. State lawyers countered that the inflated figures misled
  lenders into riskier deals and gave Trump unfair advantages over honest
  borrowers. They argue the penalty was justified by the profits he gained
  through favorable loan terms offered to wealthy borrowers. The case is one of
  several legal challenges Trump has faced. In January, he received an
  unconditional discharge in his criminal hush-money case, leaving his
  conviction intact but avoiding jail or fines. He is appealing against the
  conviction. Separately, a federal appeals court upheld a jury’s finding that
  Trump sexually abused and defamed writer E Jean Carroll, affirming a $5m
  judgment. He lost a subsequent attempt to get the court to reconsider the
  rejected appeal in June. The president is also appealing another verdict that
  requires him to pay Carroll $83.3m for additional defamation claims.
