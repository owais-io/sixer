  Chris, 24 We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause
  people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures Luke is 20 years older than me.
  If he’d had a history of dating younger people, I wouldn’t have pursued it
  because I think there’s an inherent power imbalance that comes with age-gap
  relationships. It’s something we discussed from the start, but it doesn’t come
  up for us sexually. I’ve been with more sexual partners than Luke has, so I
  had more experience than him in terms of kink and BDSM. About 80% of our sex
  is BDSM, but we’re both very touchy people, so there’s a lot of cuddling
  throughout the day. We were actually evicted from our home due to noisy sex.
  We were getting complaints from the neighbours downstairs. At one point, the
  housing association office came to the door when we were having sex – we call
  it our bang to rights moment. We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t
  want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures. Now we’ve got the
  mattresses on the floor, so we’ve learned our lesson. When we met, I was
  pre-transition, and I worried that someone who found me attractive then might
  not fancy me after I’d taken testosterone. I had my guard up, and while I
  enjoyed Luke’s company, I really didn’t think much would come of it. But both
  of us are really happy to be proven wrong, and it is a really beautiful thing
  to have been on this journey with him, and to have shared this experience.
  Luke finds me just as attractive with a bit of facial hair. He’s been super
  supportive, and I’m more self-confident in my own body now. I’m far more
  comfortable with who I am, and that is a fantastic feeling. It’s all had a
  really positive effect on my life – and on our sex life. I’ve now been on
  testosterone for a year and a half, which comes with increased libido. My
  desires are stronger than ever and I’m a feistier in bed now. Every time I go
  to the gender clinic, we pick up about 60 packets of lube, which we get
  through in about three days. Luke, 44 Even just using the correct pronouns
  while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was lovely
  I’m not a religious person, but sex to me is almost like something that’s
  transcendental. When you’ve got someone else on board with that uninhibited
  expression of human sexuality, I don’t think there’s any greater joy. Sex with
  Chris is joyous and fun. We can’t get enough of each other. We met at a bar
  three years ago, and when we first started going out I wasn’t sure if we’d be
  long term as there’s a 20-year age gap. I thought it would lead to problems,
  or an imbalance in terms of emotion and life experience. But we had such a
  connection and I found life was so much better with him. We did get carried
  away at the beginning. It was probably five times a day after we moved in
  together. I had just lost my job and we had a lot more free time together, and
  that’s when we had a lot of noise complaints from the neighbour. We probably
  could have handled it a wee bit more diplomatically, but life is short so you
  might as well just go for it. I’ve found that dirty talk can really enhance
  sex, it’s like a little bit of seasoning you put on the experience. We also
  use a lot of restraints and things like that, and we’ve ended up having a wide
  arsenal of things to do. In the last year, Chris has started taking hormone
  replacement therapy, and his treatment has allowed him to feel more
  comfortable in his own skin. To see that has been one of the most rewarding
  and exciting things in my life. Even just using the correct pronouns while we
  were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was absolutely
  lovely. It’s really nice to be there for someone throughout this process, and
  to have defied his expectations that someone would want to stay with him. It
  has been amazing to see our relationship flourish.
