  Australia’s stronger-than-expected economic growth could dash hopes for
  further interest rate cuts, Australia Associated Press reports. Reserve Bank
  of Australia governor Michele Bullock insisted she does not know “at this
  stage” what the uplift in economic growth revealed on Wednesday could mean for
  interest rates. “But it does mean that it’s possible that if it keeps going,
  then there may not be many interest rate declines left to come,” she said when
  asked after giving the 60th Shann Memorial Lecture at the University of
  Western Australia last night. Her speech focused on technological change,
  including the bank’s increasing use of text analytics models providing a
  “third lens” to monitoring shifting business conditions. “But we also overlay
  our own judgement on top of those things. “I personally don’t see a world
  where we place all our faith in a model,” she said. Traders pared back their
  rate cut expectations after the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed the
  surprise jump in the nation’s economic growth rate. Gross domestic product
  surged from 1.4 to 1.8%on an annual basis in June, above the Reserve Bank’s
  forecast of 1.6%. Bob Carr, the former Labor foreign minister, has defended
  his attendance at Xi Jinping’s carefully staged gathering of world leaders
  this week, but said he “would have avoided” the controversial photocall that
  included Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. Former Victorian premier Daniel
  Andrews has been heavily criticised for appearing in the lineup with the
  dictators and alleged war ciminals after a huge military parade in Beijing
  coinciding with China’s 80th anniversary commemorations of the defeat of Japan
  in the second world war. Speaking on ABC’s 7.30, Carr said he was in Beijing
  for the commemorations rather than the military parade, and while he did not
  attend the parade he would have avoided the group shot. I certainly would have
  avoided them, if there were the remotest possibility [of being photographed
  with Putin]. When I accepted the invitation to come to the commemoration of
  China’s enormously historically significant victory over the Japanese
  aggressor … the idea of the parade grew up separate from that. I made it clear
  to the Chinese ambassador that I wasn’t here for the parade. I was here for
  the terrific meetings I’ve been able to hold with countries that are
  like-minded, not aggressors and oppressors. Pressed on whether Daniel Andrews
  had been “naive” in allowing himself to be photographed with leaders such as
  Putin and Kim, Carr replied: Dan Andrews can speak for himself. He is someone
  who has been battered to death by media hostility in his own state, and gone
  on to win big majorities … he can defend himself. Carr said he did not watch
  the military parade and agreed with former New Zealand prime minister Helen
  Clark, who was also at the 80th anniversary commemorations, that “you and I
  wouldn’t have picked this guest list”. Carr said his attendance meant he had
  been able to engage with China, he had met the Japanese prime minister about a
  possible peace between China and Japan, and had had his first ever meeting
  with the current Indonesian foreign minister. Read more here: Good morning and
