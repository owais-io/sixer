  strands ‘newlyweds’ on honeymoon

  The new BBC series Stranded on Honeymoon Island is a “social experiment” about
  the reality of marriage that will teach audiences about “moving forward with
  your life”, its host, Davina McCall, has said. Made by the producers of
  Married at First Sight UK, the show features 12 singles looking for lifelong
  love who are matched with someone on a speed date and “married”. They are then
  stranded on a tropical island dressed only in their wedding outfit for a
  three-week honeymoon without phones, luxuries, family or friends. The idyllic
  looking island becomes a metaphor for marriage, as the reality of their
  situation – given basic rations and surrounded by insects – becomes apparent.
  While the show’s premise could be described as Love Island for older people
  crossed with First Dates crossed with Survivor, McCall says it is a “real”
  reality series that the producers “can’t steer” or predict. She said: “We’ll
  all learn something from it. It’s brilliant. It’s really tough, but it’s also
  amazingly helpful for moving forward with your life. I think anybody watching
  it is going to take a lot away from it. “It was a brilliant kind of social
  experiment, looking at people meeting in the toughest of conditions and seeing
  if love can flourish … it is a way of getting to know somebody very, very
  well, very quickly.” The presenter said the show’s format meant “leaving the
  distractions” of modern life behind so people could show their true
  characters, work ethic and resilience faster than if they met via online
  dating. She also said the show was about “being stripped of everything,” which
  is anathema in a consumer culture used to social media, grooming products and
  filters. For one contestant who likes lipstick and doing her hair, “it was
  really difficult” because without those things “she could feel herself losing
  something of herself”. McCall said it was interesting to observe how her
  partner reacted. “It’s such a learning curve for everyone. Being out there,
  you are stripped of everything that makes you you and also makes you feel
  comfortable and safe or attractive. It’s a very, very difficult experience,
  especially when you’re with someone you don’t know at all. “These are big
  things that normally don’t happen for months. It’s the quickest induction into
  someone’s life and personality and who they are. If you can survive that, I
  feel like you can survive anything.” McCall said the Stranded participants
  “genuinely really want to meet someone – and it is difficult nowadays”. A
  point echoed by one contestant, Helen, who said she took part as she was tired
  of “the endless swiping” on dating apps. At a screening of Stranded in London,
  McCall said she agreed to front the series – which airs on BBC1 and iPlayer
  this autumn – after an operation to remove a benign brain tumour which, she
  confirmed, “is not coming back”. However, she said: ”It’s changed me, in a way
  … it’s made me want to absolutely live life to the max and grow old
  disgracefully and do everything I wanted to do. Because I do understand that,
  in life, you don’t know what’s around the corner. “What I love about this
  [show] is they’re all slightly at this point where they’re like: ‘I will do
  anything to find love; I’m hitting that stage of my life and I’m really ready
  to meet somebody and settle down.’ “And they’ve taken a massive leap of faith.
  And I guess me having this operation was sort of very conducive to me
  accepting this show, because it felt quite like an adventure. And I do love
  love [and] being able to help people find that.” With the fashion for turning
  TV series, such as The Traitors, into live experiences, there is speculation
  that Stranded, created by the Scandinavian company Snowman Productions, could
  become a real-life singles dating holiday.
