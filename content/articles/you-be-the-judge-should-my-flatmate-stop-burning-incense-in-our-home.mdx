  The prosecution: Rasheeda The smell is intense, persistent and makes me
  nauseous. If she knows I hate it, she should stop My friend and flatmate
  Farrah loves incense, but I hate it. I knew it was going to be a problem when
  I moved into her flat 18 months ago, and she was walking around “sageing” the
  rooms for “energy-cleansing”. I said: “What the hell are you doing?” Whenever
  I came home, Farrah would have incense sticks burning. I asked her to not do
  it when I was at home and she agreed. But because she works from home and
  still burns it while I’m out, I’m hit by a wall of thick smoke when I come
  back from work. The smell really lingers throughout the whole flat. I still
  feel annoyed, so our agreement isn’t really working. Burning incense isn’t
  like lighting a scented candle. It’s heavy, persistent and strong. Incense
  clings to fabrics, stays in the air, and for people with sensitive sinuses
  (like me) it causes headaches and nausea. I also think it affects the vibe of
  a shared space. Farrah says it’s for the “ambience”, but it ruins it for me.
  She’s Muslim – as am I – from an Egyptian background, and grew up with incense
  at home, but I don’t think it’s insensitive to ask her not to burn it around
  me. She’s offered to try some sticks with a different scent, but they all
  smell the same to me, like burnt wood. I also find it triggering because the
  smell reminds me of a really tough time in my life when my cousin was using
  weed heavily while I lived with him. The smell makes me feel anxious, not
  calm. Plus, I read that too much incense burning makes the air quality in your
  space worse. I’m not saying Farrah’s trying to kill us slowly, but when she’s
  burning it several times a week in shared air, it becomes my problem too.
  We’ve been mates for years but, until we lived together, I didn’t know how
  incense-mad Farrah was. I’ve suggested essential-oil diffusers and candles,
  but she says they don’t have the same impact. I’ve told her that’s exactly the
  point, and we are kind of at a stalemate now. I just don’t think anyone should
  be continuously subjected to smells they find unpleasant in their own home.
  The defence: Farrah I open windows and don’t burn it when Rasheeda’s home.
  Stopping entirely isn’t a compromise For me, incense is cultural, spiritual
  and emotional. I grew up with my mum lighting it all the time, and it reminds
  me of warmth and protection. At the moment, I’m only burning it when Rasheeda
  isn’t around, or when I’m in my room. I don’t want Rasheeda to feel
  uncomfortable, but I am sticking to the rule she suggested, so I’m not doing
  anything wrong. The incense I use isn’t overpowering, and I make sure the
  windows are open so there’s airflow. It helps keep the flat smelling fresh. I
  don’t want to use candles, essential oils or sprays as they don’t have the
  same effect. Also, both of us contribute our own “notes” to the atmosphere. I
  don’t say anything when Rasheeda leaves her sweaty gym stuff in a laundry
  basket in the kitchen. Compared to that, my sandalwood and myrrh are really
  nice. It’s my home too. In fact, Rasheeda only moved in when my old flatmate
  moved out, so why should I have to completely change my lifestyle? I was happy
  to have her because we’ve been friends since we were about 25, after meeting
  at work (we’re 32 now). I’ve lived here for three years and Rasheeda moved in
  18 months ago. I’ve asked her which scents don’t bother her, and said I could
  switch to those in communal areas. But banning incense entirely feels extreme
  and unfair to me. We’re living in close quarters, which I like, but that means
  sometimes we’ll hear each other’s music, smell each other’s cooking, or have
  to deal with each other’s quirks – that’s life. The incense doesn’t linger for
  hours like she says and I’m not burning it all day. I work from home, and only
  use it now and again. I think incense helps calm the energy of our home. I
  like being in an environment that smells familiar, soothing and culturally
  resonant as it helps me decompress. Rasheeda’s feelings are valid, but so are
  mine. I’m not trying to force incense on her, and I’m happy to compromise,
  maybe by having a schedule, choosing lighter scents or sticking to certain
  times of day. But our home should reflect both of us. The jury of Guardian
  readers Is Rasheeda right to feel incensed? It seems perverse Rasheeda didn’t
  notice the incense issue before moving into her friend’s flat. To then assume
  Farrah would totally remake her lifestyle is nothing short of bizarre. Time to
  move on – and out! Stuart, 76 Smoke of any kind is heavy in particulates that
  trigger asthma and chronic conditions like migraines. Rasheeda is correct in
  ruling it out to protect the health of both tenants and visitors. (It makes me
  nauseous; I won’t enter shops that use it.) Pamela, 71 Rasheeda chose to move
  in with Farrah, so should be prepared to compromise. Farrah has modified her
  incense use, but as Rasheeda still complains I suggest Farrah burns scented
  candles in the shared spaces before Rasheeda gets home to neutralise the
  incense odours. (And wouldn’t the bathroom a more appropriate place for a
  laundry basket?) Carrie, 69 One presumes Rasheeda visited the flat prior to
  moving in, and noticed the “wall of thick smoke” then? Perhaps Farrah could
  refrain from burning incense for an hour or two before Rasheeda comes home,
  but it sounds like Rasheeda won’t be happy until the incense has been
  eradicated completely. Robbie, 55 When you flat share you need to consider
  each other’s needs: the noise, cleanliness, strong smells – anything that
  impacts on the other’s quality of life. Incense contains volatile compounds
  that some researchers consider worse than cigarettes and that are linked to
  multiple health issues. Amanda, 61 Now you be the judge In our online poll,
  tell us if you think Farrah is on the wrong scent. The poll closes on
  Wednesday 27 August at 9am BST Last week’s results We asked whether Mona
  should stop leaving so many lights on 38% of you said yes – Mona is guilty 62%
  of you said no – Mona is not guilty
