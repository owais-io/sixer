  The Guardian has identified the self-described “national socialist” behind an
  openly extremist YouTube channel that in just over two months has accumulated
  50,000 subscribers, seen more than 2.3m views, and likely made thousands of
  dollars from YouTube’s revenue-sharing monetization program. Johnathan
  Christopher “Chris” Booth, 37, lives in the unincorporated community of Coral,
  a part of Maple Valley Township in Michigan’s Montcalm county, and is married
  to a senior local Republican official. Booth has published more than 70
  YouTube videos since May on his Shameless Sperg account, whose graphic design
  elements feature stylized SS bolts. Titles of his videos – generally a
  recording of him delivering his views direct to camera – include: “Why I
  Dislike Jews. It’s not complicated”, “Black Crimes Matter: Never Relax” and
  “Jews and FBI hate you and your free speech”. Typically the videos attract
  hundreds of comments from like-minded YouTube users. His channel has seen such
  remarkable success that it has drawn apparently baseless allegations from
  other far-right creators that he is a “fed”. On an X account that frequently
  advertises his videos, his posts include antisemitic comments and in one
  response to a post about actor Jim Carrey he writes: “All of them deserve
  rope. I advocate for national socialism though, under which idiots like this
  would not fare too well.” Despite YouTube’s stated policies against hate
  speech and content that promotes violence against individuals or groups based
  on race, religion or other protected characteristics, Booth’s channel appears
  to be monetized through the YouTube Partner Program. The channel displays ads
  and Booth has thanked subscribers for their financial support through the
  platform. YouTube’s community guidelines explicitly prohibit content that
  “promotes violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race or
  ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual
  orientation, gender, gender identity, or other characteristic that is
  associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization”. A YouTube
  spokesperson said: “Upon review, we terminated the channel for violating our
  community guidelines. Content that promotes violence or hatred against
  individuals or groups based on their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion
  is not allowed on YouTube.” According to YouTube, another account associated
  with Booth was terminated, and creators are no longer entitled to earn any
  revenue if their channel is terminated. The terminations happened after the
  Guardian reached out to YouTube with questions about Booth’s activities. Also
  according to YouTube, content that promotes violence or hatred against
  individuals or groups based on their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion
  is not allowed on the platform. In the wake of the ban, Booth took to X to say
  that he would move his content to “alt-tech” platforms such as Odysee. Booth
  is married to Meghyn “Meg” Booth, the Republican treasurer of Maple Valley
  Township. Meg Booth has “liked” several posts with extremist themes on Chris
  Booth’s Facebook account with her personal account. Chris Booth’s Facebook
  page also features extensive racist propaganda along with iconography often
  employed by neo-Nazis. The revelations raise questions about the extent to
  which YouTube, whose parent company Alphabet also owns Google, Waymo and other
  tech companies, has backslid on monitoring extremism on its platform. Jeff
  Tischauser, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center
  (SPLC), said Booth’s operation across YouTube, X and merchandising platforms
  was a “boilerplate Nazi grift”. “He may be earning money from YouTube, as well
  as hawking these racist and antisemitic items on his website like cups and
  T-shirts,” Tischauser added. He said that YouTube is “the premier site that
  these guys look to in order to expand their following and to make money off of
  that following”. How we identified Booth The Guardian retrieved a Coral,
  Michigan, street address from EU-mandated General Product Safety Regulation
  compliance information on the Shameless Sperg merchandise page on the
  merchandising platform Printify. The property at that address is owned by Meg
  Booth, according to property records. Data brokers indicate that Chris Booth
  lives at the same address. Sites including realtor.com show exterior views of
  the house at the property. The property’s color and cladding match those
  visible in videos published to YouTube on 14 and 15 May. Chris Booth appears
  to have made some efforts to remove photographs of himself and other
  potentially identifying information from his own social media accounts and
  other online spaces. However, he is visible in “shorts”-style videos posted by
  Meg Booth to Facebook. This video of Chris Booth depicts the same person
  visible in Shameless Sperg videos. The Guardian emailed both Chris and Meg
  Booth for comment. In an email, Meg Booth appeared to repudiate her husband’s
  views. “I am not involved in my husband’s content or political views, and I do
  not share or support any form of racism, antisemitism, or hate speech,” she
  wrote, adding: “My values are my own and are grounded in respect, inclusion,
  and service to the community.” Meg Booth concluded: “As an elected official,
  I’ve always acted independently, with integrity, and in line with the
  expectations of my office. I respectfully decline further comment.” Chris
  Booth did not directly respond, but in the day after the email he took to X to
  reaffirm his views, including a post in which he wrote: “I’ve come to believe
  fascists are born, not made. Discovering real fascism in my early thirties was
  like looking into a mirror and finally realizing why commies have called me a
  fascist for so long. They spotted it before I could, but then I wholeheartedly
  embraced it.” Extremist content rife with ‘crass racism’ In his videos and on
  X, Booth explicitly embraces neo-Nazi ideology and promotes antisemitic
  conspiracy theories. On his Shameless Sperg X account, Booth writes: “I am the
  Shameless Sperg, I am a National Socialist, and I do sperg rants here,” with a
  link to his YouTube channel. On the YouTube channel, he writes: “This channel
  is a collection of sperg rants and commentary on the news &amp; issues of the
  day, or whatever else is on my mind, from an autistically dissident and NS
  perspective.” “Sperg”, an abbreviation for Asperger syndrome, is used
  pejoratively in far-right circles for those whose obsessive and open extremism
  might put off normal people or draw unwanted attention. “NS” is commonly used
  as an abbreviation for “national socialist” in far-right circles. His videos
  almost all contain neo-Nazi perspectives, enunciating conspiratorial
  antisemitism, anti-Black racism and claims that white people are superior to
  all other races. In a June video titled “There is no Anti-Semitism without
  Semitism”, Booth states in relation to interwar Germany: “Extreme sadism and
  humiliation towards Gentiles is a Jewish tradition … Now, you might begin to
  understand why, after 14 years of seeing their people tormented by the Jews,
  millions of Germans organized, gained political power and broke the chains of
  Jewish tyranny in Germany.” The video continues with Booth arguing that
  antisemitism is a just response to the behavior of Jews, and sarcastically
  dismisses the idea that it is “just some ancient mental pathogen in the minds
  of the goyim, it just springs to life for no reason just to make things harder
  for the Jews”. In a July video, Booth defended recent attempts to create a
  whites-only community in Arkansas. He said: “White people are allowed to
  congregate together without being accompanied by some fucking Black person or
  some Jew.” In another July video Booth said: “Black people oppress themselves.
  I don’t do it. I have no interest in it. I, you know, I just want them away
  from me. You know, I want them away from me, my community, my state, my
  country. I don’t know. Just, I don’t know, get the fuck away from me.” In a
  May video supporting Trump’s program of allowing Afrikaner refugees into the
  country on the basis of a fictional “white genocide” in South Africa, Booth
  said: “You know, I’m hoping that they don’t completely lose South Africa to
  the Black plague, but, um, but in any event, uh, things are going to fall
  apart for them and go shit sideways.” Tischauser, the SPLC analyst, said that
  the themes of Booth’s videos mix “crass racism, basic historic white power
  talking points” and “pseudo-academic kind of takes on Black criminality or
  Black behavior”. Meg Booth, Chris Booth’s wife, was in November elected as the
  treasurer of Maple Valley Township running as a Republican. Her public social
  media profile does not feature the kind of extremist messaging that Chris
  Booth offers on his platform, though she has interacted with posts on his
  Facebook account, which is also freighted with racist messaging and neo-Nazi
  imagery. Chris Booth also “liked” posts in which his wife discussed her
  candidacy.
