  Paroxysms of glee among Labour’s many enemies greeted last week’s forecast of
  a £41.2bn black hole awaiting Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget, from influential
  thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).
  Expect another three months of bone-rattling warnings about imminent tax raids
  crushing every family. She is in a doom loop; no way out; ha, ha, ha! Voices
  in the Treasury sound sanguine, pointing out that NIESR has a record of
  eccentric forecasts. Before the spring statement, it predicted that Reeves
  needed £57bn just to keep her fiscal rules: actually, it was £4.1bn. For
  Jeremy Hunt as chancellor in 2023, it generously forecast he had £97.5bn to
  spend: on the day, that had shrunk to £6.5bn. But the truth universally
  acknowledged (if not publicly by the government) is that taxes must rise. Debt
  interest costs £100bn a year, growth is nowhere near enough for rising NHS,
  pensions and welfare costs. Even the right talks of a “brutally honest
  conversation with the public”: that’s from Robert Colvile, the director of the
  Centre for Policy Studies, daring to come up with solutions that would sink
  his party at an election: “No more triple lock. Raising the state pension age
  … Asking people to pay for their social care out of their housing wealth.”
  (Quite right, but toxic in Torydom.) Even more surprising, the director of the
  rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), Tom Clougherty, advocates a tax
  rise: ending VAT exemptions to almost double the intake. The Institute for
  Fiscal Studies (IFS) agrees, and has suggested using the billions raised to
  generously compensate all lower-income households for their extra shopping
  costs. The IEA would compensate the losers, but spend the rest on cutting
  income tax. Counterintuitively, the great bulk of these untargeted VAT
  exemptions reward highest spenders – Waitrose not Iceland shoppers. There is a
  new honesty about tax and spend among the serious. Hunting for easy money is
  becoming a national game. The rising clamour for wealth taxes springs from
  what everyone knows: the rich have gained monstrously from an economy that
  propels the upward redistribution of wealth. The 50 wealthiest UK families own
  more than the poorest half of the population, says a report from the Equality
  Trust. Much billionaire wealth comes from the ownership of property and
  financial assets, not “entrepreneurial spirit”, inflated deliberately by a
  decade of quantitative easing. The inheritocracy dominates. Time to reach in
  and take some back. The Tax Justice Network wants a 2% levy on wealth over
  £10m, raising £24bn a year, strongly backed by Oxfam, Dale Vince and the
  Patriotic Millionaires UK campaign. The public agrees, by 75% to 13% against.
  Naturally, the great wealth-protection machine is in overdrive. The
  consultancy Henley &amp; Partners claims that 16,500 UK millionaires are
  fleeing, quoted everywhere as gospel truth, but has been comprehensively
  questioned in a thorough report by Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates. Henley
  is a company that facilitates citizenship and residency for a wealthy
  clientele. But the narrative is out there: Labour has caused a tax flight.
  However, Neidle, no rightwinger, issues warnings about wealth taxes. Wealth is
  now grotesquely agglomerated among very, very few, so 80% of wealth tax
  revenue would come from just 5,000 people and 15% from just 10 people. That
  makes the tax “uniquely vulnerable” to a handful who are gaming valuations or
  quitting Britain. Unless every country did it, he warns a regular levy would
  deter inward investors. The IFS is equally sceptical. The business secretary,
  Jonathan Reynolds, rudely dismisses the whole idea as “daft”. Does that mean
  it’s dead? Not necessarily, as other Labour figures, talking to the Treasury
  team, put forward ideas privately that have wind in their sails. An instant
  retrospective wealth-tax raid to raise money urgently for that 5% GDP pledged
  for national defence has backing, I hear from those talking to the Treasury.
  Demanding a one-off whack for the defence of the realm could be popular and
  practicable. What’s more, howls of protest from the wealthy would help rebrand
  Labour usefully as both socially just and patriotic. There are many ways to
  skin fat cats, using existing taxes. Here is the list from the Centre for the
  Analysis of Taxation: the big tax-raisers are £16.7bn from equalising capital
  gains and income tax rates, treating all income the same. But look how
  craftily the rich defend themselves: private equity lobbying just won a very
  quiet reprieve to keep disguising earned income as low-taxed capital gain.
  Running rings around the taxman, some escape inheritance tax on precious art
  works by promising to make them accessible to the public and then failing;
  some have even been sold. At least Labour is hiring 5,000 HMRC staff, cut by
  the Tories despite collecting many multiples of their salaries. Everyone needs
  the services that national insurance symbolises: it should be paid on all
  incomes, for landlords, shareholders and investments. Nor will taxing the rich
  be enough: income tax can’t be taboo, never raised since Denis Healey in 1975,
  as “drastic times call for drastic action”, writes Paul Johnson, the recently
  departed IFS director. Property is grossly undertaxed: be brave and reform
  council tax into a fairer land-value tax. What is certain is that promises
  will be broken, taxes raised and the faux row will be equally ear-splitting
  whether Reeves takes a lot or a little. So go for radicalism; the country
  needs it – for defence, health, old age, decayed infrastructure and green
  power. Roll the pitch now, prepare the way, and change the moral climate on
  the tax deniers and avoiders. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist
