  “That was SO COOL!” What’s cool around here? The aggressively upbeat DJ box?
  The handsome supply teacher type with the roving microphone whose job is force
  people to clap and who promises to get your selfie on the big screen, but only
  if it’s “supportive”? Perhaps the singer Sapphire is cool, present to perform
  a live world premiere of her new single during the interval, which she started
  just as the rain came thrashing down, sending 10,000 people stampeding from
  the stands as the opening notes rang out. To her credit Sapphire carried on
  gamely, serenading the empty seats. The new single is called Pessimist. Her
  last one was In Crisis. Presumably all of these are taken from the forthcoming
  album Career-Ending Side-Strain. In fact the answer was none of these. It
  turns out Ben Stokes is cool. England’s Test captain could be seen wandering
  towards the Utilita Bowl, cap pulled down, an hour into the opening instalment
  of the Southern Braves versus Northern Superchargers women-men double-header.
  It was here that the good thing happened. Stokes spotted the pair of gawping
  kids across a mini-roundabout, went across, said hello, signed a piece of
  paper, then kept on trudging past the otherwise oblivious passersby, leaving a
  couple of very happy pre-converted fans. He is, in his own words, “milling
  around” the Hundred during his injury layoff, present to offer aura, optics,
  star power. Later in the day he could be seen diffusing his own Big Stokes
  Energy from the Superchargers bench as the men’s team chased victory, just
  another part of the tapestry on what was actually a very good day, a day where
  everything was good, bright, chipper, and undeniably functional. Come for the
  Hundred: the Hundred will come for you too. Last week I wrote a column with a
  line that suggested the Hundred was the worst thing cricket has ever done. To
  be fair, this was based on an extended totting up of its silly format,
  cult-like tone, failure to meet its own aims, and the destructive nature of
  its subsidised scheduling. But yes, obviously the Hundred isn’t as bad as
  rebel tours or concussion. It’s better than the recently collapsed Caymans Max
  60 League, described as “the Fyre festival of cricket”, as unpaid players fled
  the islands. So yes. Better than that. But the article was enough to draw
  accusations of curmudgeonliness, not getting it, being insufficiently
  progressive-by-rite and so on. “Yeah. I saw your piece,” was the verdict in
  the Utilita Bowl press room from one of the Hundred’s warmer followers. Not
  enjoyed. Read. Let us be clear. The punishment is this. A day at the Hundred.
  Or at least, the requirement to talk about the other stuff too. Because the
  fact is, plenty of people do seem to like this, or are at least willing to
  consume it. At times here the Rose Bowl was close to four-fifths full, this
  for a non-international match between two recently invented teams. What is
  happening here? And is it good? Even on a grudging lime-green August morning
  the Utilita is a lovely venue, from woodland rising up behind the tented main
  stand, to the groovy raised walkways around its sides plastered with wrap
  stalls and hog roasts and ale bars. People came rolling into the stands from
  10.27am, an orderly conga of bags and shorts and hoodies, the complete English
  summer day defence system. The stage looked shiny, epic and coherently
  glammed-up, with the DJ stage cranked at one end and the Sky Sports commentary
  hutch primly in place, like the world’s most illustrious kebab van. “Let’s get
  at it, the Utilita Bowl! Come on let’s go. I can’t hear you! Pump it up!” To
  be fair to the in-house DJ, who was pretty good all day, 10.56am isn’t the
  ideal timeslot for the purveying of vibes. But the crowd was still good here,
  close to 4,000 for the start of the women’s match, and family-dominated,
  reflecting the school holiday scheduling. What else is going on in Hampshire
  anyway? What’s On Hampshire recommends Portsmouth Cathedral, the Fordingham
  reptile exhibition and a Jane Austen tour of Basingstoke. For once, everything
  is in favour of this thing actually working, which is not a flaw or a gotcha
  or evidence of betrayal, but a rare instance of good cricket planning. The
  lesson is: if you sell it, they will come. If you make it dead cheap, they
  will come. Why didn’t anyone care enough to work this out before? From the
  start the vibe was super-maxed, super-happy, super-up. But the women’s game
  was also sabotaged by its early start time and by a slow, tired pitch. This is
  a recurrent problem: 10 for one off 15 balls became 26 for three. Phoebe
  Litchfield, a brilliant young batter, played one thrilling slash through
  covers and then chopped on a ball that veered in late. Cue tongues of fire,
  booming music, and a slight haze of disappointment. Annabel Sutherland, who
  has three Test hundreds, scratched about as the ball nibbled and stuck. Hollie
  Armitage played a late blinder, but also one of those knocks that tells you
  conditions have eased and you’re about to lose. There was at least a glimpse
  of the sublime cover drive of Laura Wolvaardt as the Brave strolled home. The
  crowd seemed happy enough, engaged enough, jabbed and nudged along by the
  in-house soundtrack. Is this good? It felt good. It’s hard to argue with a
  plan being executed. The issues with the Hundred are the format itself, which
  is too cramped, too breathless, too mega-dumbed for players to really excel.
  The gushing tone could be dialled back from desperate and alienating to simply
  encouraging. Crowding out every other format from the centre of the summer for
  this still seems strange. The good things are also pretty obvious in the
  flesh. The England and Wales Cricket Board has been obliged by its own
  jamboree to fund and showcase the women’s game properly. People are watching
  it, consumers rather than fans, who may or may not learn to love this thing,
  but people all the same. And this has always been the underlying tension here,
  a question of ownership. Who is this actually for anyway? A clue arrived the
  same morning as the Braves versus the Superchargers in the form of an email to
  every Hundred subscriber warning that “as part of the change of ownership” the
  Hundred would now be passing your personal data to the franchise owners as
  part of the sale. Oh. OK then. But then, this was always the deal. The month
  of August in England now belongs to a different class of person, not families
  and virgin eyeballs, but tech titans, investors, finance bros. Taking the
  money now for a slice of your own tomorrow: this is not a free hit. Something
  is lost with it, control ceded. In reality the Hundred is still in its
  chrysalis phase. It has always been a gateway, if only for private equity to
  make its way into the summer. How long will the Hundred be the Hundred? How
  long before the thing itself is junked, expanded and formalised in other
  directions. But this was still a good Hundred day. Fun was had, cricket
  delivered, that weirdly shallow, bolt-on Hundred vibe revved up to 11. By late
  afternoon the men’s game had produced a genuine thriller, won with a last-ball
  six from Graham Clark. And in that moment it did feel cool; or at least like a
  strange, plastic format, product-sport, finding its own kind of moment.
