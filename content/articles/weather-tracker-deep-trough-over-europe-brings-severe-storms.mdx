  Severe storms linked to a deep upper air trough formed from the ex-hurricane
  Erin lashed parts of western and southern Europe last week. Italy was hit by
  severe rainfall on Thursday that caused flooding in the Lombardy region. The
  commune of Busto Arsizio was badly affected, with more than 100mm of rain and
  frequent lightning. Heavy rain continued into Friday, leading to a landslide
  near the town of Baveno in north-west Italy, while to the east, in the town of
  Padua, 56.9mm of rain fell in only 78 minutes. The downpours spread to
  Slovenia, where 79mm of rain was recorded near the town of Logatec within two
  hours, causing localised flooding. France also faced hail, heavy rain and
  powerful winds. The European Severe Weather Database said there were seven
  tornadoes across France on Friday, four of which were in the Nouvelle
  Aquitaine region. Two of these reached IF1 status on the international Fujita
  scale, which suggests instantaneous wind at about 40mph (64km/h). These speeds
  were estimated by the damage caused to infrastructure, trees and crops. On
  Saturday, a surface low and an upper air trough caused hailstorms to develop
  widely in Italy. Large stones measuring 20-30mm fell in Umbria, Abruzzo,
  Molise and Puglia. A 92mm stone was found in the town of Guglionesi, Molise.
  As hail, and notably large hail, is often irregular in shape, the diameter is
  taken as the longest axis of the stone. In Umbria, the largest confirmed stone
  was 60mm. Rainfall totals of 31mm were also recorded here within just 36
  minutes.
