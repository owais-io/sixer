  A union representing US Centers for Disease Control employees has demanded
  that the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation after a man who
  evidently blamed the Covid-19 vaccination for making him depressed and
  suicidal aimed gunfire Friday at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta. The
  30-year-old shooting suspect, who killed a police officer and died during the
  attack, had also tried to get into the CDC’s headquarters – but he was stopped
  by guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street and opening fire, a
  law enforcement official told the Associated Press on Saturday. The CDC
  workers’ union said the deadly violence on Friday was not random and
  “compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff
  have endured”. It said vaccine misinformation had put scientists at risk. The
  American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, added that the CDC
  and leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHH) – headed
  by Trump administration appointee and avowed vaccine safety skeptic Robert F
  Kennedy Jr – must provide a “clear and unequivocal stance in condemning
  vaccine disinformation”. Such a public statement by federal officials is
  needed to help prevent violence against scientists, the union said in a news
  release. “Their leadership is critical in reinforcing public trust and
  ensuring that accurate, science-based information prevails,” the union said.
  Patrick Joseph White was armed with five guns, including at least one long
  gun, when he attacked, said an official who spoke to the Associated Press on
  condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss
  the investigation. White’s gunfire hit at least four CDC buildings, the
  agency’s director, Susan Monarez, said on X. DeKalb county police officer
  David Rose was mortally wounded while responding. Rose, 33, a former US marine
  who served in Afghanistan, had graduated from the police academy in March.
  White was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the
  CDC campus and died at the scene, Atlanta police chief Darin Schierbaum said.
  He added that “we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or
  if it was self-inflicted”. The Georgia bureau of investigations said the crime
  scene was “complex”. The agency added that the investigation into the violence
  would take “an extended period of time”. Fired But Fighting, a group of
  laid-off CDC employees, has said Kennedy Jr is directly responsible for the
  villainization of the CDC’s workforce through “his continuous lies about
  science and vaccine safety, which have fueled a climate of hostility and
  mistrust”. Kennedy Jr reached out to staff on Saturday. The DHH secretary said
  “no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others”.
  Dr Jerome Adams, who served as the US surgeon general during Donald Trump’s
  first presidency, said Kennedy’s response to Friday’s shooting was “tepid”,
  late and amounted to a “failed … test” of his leadership. “That’s not even
  considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has actually contributed
  to a lot of what’s been going on,” Adams said on Sunday on CBS’s Face the
  Nation. Adams said the mRNA-based vaccine technology that helped end the
  Covid-19 pandemic saved more than 2 million lives “by the most conservative
  estimates”. His comments came days after Kennedy moved to cancel $500m in mRNA
  vaccine research. Thousands of people who work on critical disease research
  are employed on the attacked campus. The union said some staff were huddled in
  various buildings until late at night. More than 90 young children were locked
  down inside the CDC’s Clifton school. The union said CDC staff should not be
  required to immediately return to work after experiencing such a traumatic
  event. In its statement on Saturday, it said windows and buildings should
  first be fixed and made “completely secure”. “Staff should not be required to
  work next to bullet holes,” the union said. “Forcing a return under these
  conditions risks re-traumatizing staff by exposing them to the reminders of
  the horrific shooting they endured.” The union also called for “perimeter
  security on all campuses” until the investigation is fully completed and
  shared with staff. White’s father contacted police and identified his son as
  the possible shooter. He said White had been upset over the death of his dog
  and also had become fixated on the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the law
  enforcement official who spoke to the AP anonymously. A neighbor of White told
  the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that White “seemed like a good guy” but spoke
  with her multiple times about distrusting Covid-19 vaccines in unrelated
  conversations. “He was very unsettled, and he very deeply believed that
  vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people,” Nancy Hoalst told the
  Atlanta newspaper. “He emphatically believed that.” But Hoalst said she never
  believed White would be violent: “I had no idea he thought he would take it
  out on the CDC.”
