  Warmer weather and a series of sporting events lifted retail sales last month
  but retailers said the return to growth “barely touched the sides” and warned
  that mooted higher taxes would lead to shop closures and job losses. Retail
  sales rose by 2.5% year on year in July as consumers rushed to buy food during
  England’s successful Euros football campaign and the British &amp; Irish Lions
  rugby tour of Australia. The warm weather encouraged shoppers to spend on
  clothes, while homeware and indoor furniture sales grew steadily, recovering
  from the previous year’s decline, according to British Retail Consortium-KPMG
  data. The BRC report said Britain’s fifth-warmest July on record played a
  significant role in the resurgence, bolstering home appliance and food and
  drink sales. In June it reported an annualised growth rate of just 0.5%. A
  separate survey by Barclaycard found consumers were more inclined to spend on
  discretionary items, crediting the general release of tickets for Lewis
  Capaldi’s 2025 tour for helping to lift the amount spent on live shows and
  concerts by 9.3% in July. A report this week by the market research company
  Circana suggested adults’ spending on toys had been a fillip for retailers. It
  found that UK toy sales had risen 8% so far this year, after a fall of almost
  4% in 2024. Barclaycard said consumer card spending grew 1.4% year on year in
  July, compared with a decline of 0.1% in June. Discretionary spending jumped
  by 2.4% but essential spending declined 0.7%. Consumers appeared to still be
  confident in their own finances, matching previous months, but a gap has
  opened up with perceptions of the wider economy, the credit card provider
  said. Confidence in the strength of the UK economy fell three points month on
  month to 22%, the lowest level since January (21%), having climbed in May to
  28%, Barclaycard said. Meanwhile, consumers remained confident they could
  balance their personal finances. This measure held firm at 75%, just one point
  below the 76% recorded in June. Confidence in household finances stabilised at
  72%, down marginally from 73% in June, which was a four-month high. The
  average worker in the UK has benefited from more than two years of
  inflation-busting wage rises, increasing disposable incomes. Most households
  have built up higher levels of savings during that time, fearing that a
  decline in the economic outlook will result in higher redundancy levels and
  lower pay growth. The BRC said tax rises and pay increases from the higher
  national minimum wage worth £7bn would continue to weigh heavily on employers,
  and warned jobs could go if the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, adds further costs
  to retailers by raising taxes in the autumn as anticipated. The chief
  executive of the BRC, Helen Dickinson, said the 2.5% increase in retail sales
  was higher than the 12-month average growth of 1.9%, but food inflation meant
  most consumers were buying the same amount, just at higher prices. “With sales
  growth at these levels, it is barely touching the sides of covering the new
  costs imposed on retailers at the last budget,” she said. “If the upcoming
  autumn budget sees more taxes levied on retailers’ shoulders, many will be
  forced to make difficult choices about the future of shops and jobs, and
  ongoing pressure would push prices higher. “Ultimately, this means more
  families struggling, particularly those on lower incomes, reduced consumer
  spending and a drag on economic growth.” Barclaycard said consumers were using
  artificial intelligence to manage their personal finances. It said 35% of UK
  adults had used AI to help them plan, budget or analyse their spending, rising
  to 69% among gen Z consumers. Linda Ellett, a spokesperson for KPMG, said a
  jump in the spend on discretionary items only made up for some of the hit to
  household spending power after inflation rose to 3.6% in June. “With
  employment costs having risen and inflation both a business and consumer side
  pressure, it remains a challenging trading environment for many retailers,”
  she said.
