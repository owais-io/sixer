  The story of human evolution has undergone a distinct feminisation in recent
  decades. Or, rather, an equalisation: a much-needed rebalancing after 150
  years during which, we were told, everything was driven by males strutting,
  brawling and shagging, with females just along for the ride. This reckoning
  has finally arrived at language. The origins of our species’ exceptional
  communication skills constitutes one of the more nebulous zones of the larger
  evolutionary narrative, because many of the bits of the human anatomy that
  allow us to communicate – notably the brain and the vocal tract – are soft and
  don’t fossilise. The linguistic societies of Paris and London even banned talk
  of evolution around 1870, and the subject only made a timid comeback about a
  century later. Plenty of theories have been tossed into the evidentiary void
  since then, mainly by men, but now evolutionary biologist Madeleine Beekman,
  of the University of Sydney, has turned her female gaze on the problem. Her
  theory, which she describes as having been hiding in plain sight, is
  compelling: language evolved in parallel with caring for our “underbaked”
  newborns, because looking after a creature as helpless as a human baby on the
  danger-filled plains of Africa required more than one pair of hands (and
  feet). It needed a group among whom the tasks of food-gathering, childcare and
  defence could be divided. A group means social life, which means
  communication. The evidence to support Beekman’s theory isn’t entirely
  lacking, though a lot of it is, necessarily, circumstantial. We know that the
  compromise that natural selection hit upon to balance the competing anatomical
  demands of bipedalism and an ever-expanding brain was to have babies come out
  early – before that brain and its bony casing were fully formed. One of the
  discoveries of the newly feminised wave of evolutionary science has been that
  alloparents – individuals other than the biological parents who contribute
  parenting services – played a critical role in ensuring the survival of those
  half-cooked human children. Another is that stone age women hunted alongside
  men. In the past it was assumed that hunting bands were exclusively male, and
  one theory held that language arose to allow them to cooperate. But childcare
  was another chore that called for cooperation, probably also between genders,
  and over years, not just hours or days. Luckily, the reconfiguration of the
  head and neck required to accommodate the ballooning brain had a side-effect
  of remoulding the throat, giving our ancestors more precise control over their
  utterances. With the capacity to generate a large range of sounds came the
  ability to convey a large range of meanings. To begin with, this was useful
  for coordinating childcare, but as speech became more sophisticated,
  alloparents – particularly grandmothers – used it to transmit their
  accumulated knowledge, thereby nurturing infants who were even better equipped
  to survive. The result of this positive feedback loop was Homo sapiens, the
  sole survivor of a once diverse lineage. Alas, Beekman takes a very long time
  to get to this exciting idea. She spends about half the book laying the
  groundwork, padding it out with superfluous vignettes as if she is worried the
  centre won’t hold. Once she gets there, she makes some thought-provoking
  observations. Full-blown language probably emerged about 100,000 years ago,
  she thinks, but only in our line – not in those of our closest relatives. “We
  may have made babies with Neanderthals and Denisovans,” she writes, “but I
  don’t think we had much to talk about.” And whereas others have argued that
  language must have predated Homo sapiens, because without it the older species
  Homo erectus couldn’t have crossed the forbidding Wallace Line – the
  deep-water channel that separates Asia and Australasia – she draws on her deep
  knowledge of social insects to show that communication as relatively
  unsophisticated as that of bees or ants could have done the job. Having made a
  persuasive case for the role of alloparents in the evolution of language,
  Beekman concludes that we did ourselves a disservice when we shrank our basic
  unit of organisation down from the extended to the nuclear family. Maybe, but
  historians including Peter Laslett have dated this important shift to the
  middle ages, long before the Industrial Revolution where she places it, and
  the damage isn’t obvious yet. Language is still being soaked up by young
  children; it’s still a vehicle for intergenerational learning. It may take a
  village to raise a child, but as Beekman herself hints, a village can be
  constituted in different ways. • The Origin of Language: How We Learned to
  Speak and Why by Madeleine Beekman is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£25).
