  You’ve explored worlds of dystopia, historical epics and perplexing moral
  aspects of the universe. What idea or question has haunted you the longest?
  RemyNaylor Who’s up there. He’d better show himself shortly, because we’re
  getting into a terrible mess down here. I mean, we are the fucking plague, 7.5
  billion people, we can’t handle the planet. As you get older, you do wonder:
  is it going to be a guy with a long beard and long, flowing white robes, or is
  it just going to be a void? I don’t dwell on it. It’s weird. I feel like I’m
  still 21. It’s odd and strange. Did you score a lifetime’s supply of bread for
  directing the Hovis adverts back in the 70s? TeeDubyaBee No. But I ate enough
  Hovis as a kid in Stockton-on-Tees, with cherry jam and butter, toasted – holy
  shit. I did five Hovis commercials. They were all classics. The most famous is
  the boy walking up the hill. The first one I shot up near Halifax, in a mining
  town. Oddly enough, I might go back up there to do my next movie, which is a
  war movie [Battle of Britain], so I’m well versed in the area. It’s incredible
  that you are still at the top of your game at 87. How has age affected your
  approach to film-making? grimesy76 What happens – providing you sustain all
  your marbles – is that you refine your game. I can now work eight to 11
  cameras. I finished my latest film in 34 days. It would normally be 60.
  Gladiator was 48; normally, 100. I’ve learned to formulate and predetermine,
  plan on paper and storyboard in my head. That’s why it’s so efficient. My game
  was tennis. I’ve just had my final knee replacement. I did one in 2012 and the
  other last week. So that’s the end of tennis. But like any game, the more you
  practise, the better you get. Forty years of tennis, I became quite good. If I
  hadn’t played tennis, I’d be a 300lb [136kg] couch potato. Every time I drive
  back up to Redcar in Yorkshire to visit relatives, I can’t help but notice how
  Roseberry Topping Hill resembles the dome-like structure on LV-223 in
  Prometheus. Do you add touches like this for your own amusement? magbearson
  Roseberry Topping Hill was our favourite walk. It tickles me that it’s called
  Roseberry Topping. I used to have a country house in the Cotswolds. It was
  beautiful, but it was always fucking raining. It was probably built in the
  1600s. We’d live by candlelight and I loved all that. I bought it for 72
  grand. You couldn’t repair your garage for 72 grand today. But the kids no
  longer wanted to play ponies and shit like that, so I sold it. I missed the
  countryside, so I bought a teeny-weeny vineyard in France 30 years ago. In one
  corner, there’s a hill. I thought: “Fuck me, that looks just like Roseberry
  Topping.” I don’t advise taking up wine growing as a career, though. No one
  fucking drinks any more. My ambition is just to break even. You once told the
  Hollywood Reporter that your favourite film is Muriel’s Wedding. Can you
  explain why? Sjp15991 I was being cheeky, but I loved it to death, because I
  love the idea of the two women who are constantly optimistic. And I have to
  admit, I quite like Abba. I sing Abba in the bathroom still. The Final Cut is,
  without a doubt, the perfect version of Blade Runner. What would you say to
  people who defend the theatrical cut? TheManWithoutFear I think they all had
  their day. The most disappointing thing I learned is that you have to be your
  own critic. I’ve never read another critique since. The big critic at the
  time, Pauline Kael, destroyed me in four pages in the New Yorker. She said: he
  may have a weak jaw, that’s why he’s got a beard. She’d never even met me! I
  framed the pages and they are still in my office. I glance at them
  occasionally and go: “Fuck you, Pauline.” Your father was in the military. Did
  he ever disapprove of you wanting to be an art student? Jagoman No. My dad, at
  the end of the second world war, was an acting brigadier general. He said to
  me: “Ridley, the army has absolutely nothing to teach you. You’re terrible
  academically” – I got D, D, C, E, E, E, D, but an A+ at art – “go to art
  school.” I’ll never forget my art teacher at Grangefield grammar school – Mr
  Cleeland. He was one of the new-age teachers who came in with long hair and
  who everyone said was weird, but he was a great guy. How close did you get to
  designing the Daleks on Doctor Who? badrobot2 I was a very good designer. I
  was in an office, sharing with a guy called Ray Cusick. Verity Lambert was the
  producer. Ray said: “What do you think?” I said: “They look like inverted dust
  cans. I think they look fucking terrible.” He said: “That’s what I think. But
  that’s what she wants.” Guess what? They’re still here today. Will there be a
  third Alien prequel and a Gladiator 3? petewinf and bozo500 Gladiator is in
  process right now. Another Alien prequel – yeah, if I get an idea, for sure.
  Were you really considering directing Terminator 3? bozo500 I’m proud about
  this. I turned down a $20m fee. See, I can’t be bought, dude. Someone said:
  “Ask what Arnie gets.” I thought: “I’ll try it out.” I said: “I want what
  Arnie gets.” When they said yes, I thought: “Fuck me.” But I couldn’t do it.
  It’s not my thing. It’s like doing a Bond movie. The essence of a Bond movie
  is fun and camp. Terminator is pure comic strip. I would try to make it real.
  That’s why they’ve never asked me to do a Bond movie, because I could fuck it
  up. Have you taken the Voight-Kampff [diagnostic empathy] test from Blade
  Runner yourself? Sagarmatha1953 Isn’t that machine great? Some bastard stole
  it from the set. When it appears on the market, I’m going to go after them
  like a rat up a drainpipe. I never used to take things. I’d think: “I’m done,
  move on.” Now, I realise I should, because they go into storerooms and get
  lost for ever. I get permission to take things and put space suits from movies
  in my vineyard in France. I’ve got a space suit from The Martian. I’ve got an
  original space suit from Alien. Can you imagine what that’s worth? Two from
  Prometheus. They’re all in my barrel room, which has 12,000 sq ft [1,115 sq
  metres] of barrels. It’s the perfect temperature for the wine. It’s also a
  perfect place for a museum. Go down to Avignon – the vineyard is 20 minutes
  from my house – and have a look. It’s fantastic. I love the press junkets and
  interviews where you tell interviewers to “go fuck themselves”. Do you swear
  more now than you did when you were, say, 50? Chin_Of_Tarantino and Bicuser
  No. I was much worse in my 50s. How many times have I sworn in this interview?
  Ten? Twenty? Some are so satisfying, like: what the fuck do you think you’re
  doing? Swearing is a sign of intelligence? Are you taking the mickey out of
  me? No? Then I must be very clever. • Ridley Scott: Building Cinematic Worlds
