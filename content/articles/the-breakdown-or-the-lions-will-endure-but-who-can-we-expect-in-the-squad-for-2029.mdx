  The average worker bee, in the busiest months of the year, generally lives for
  up to seven weeks. Talk about a short and sweet existence. It is not
  dissimilar with British &amp; Irish Lions tours. One moment players are
  winning a major series, the next their team abruptly ceases to exist. That’s
  all, folks, unless you can make the next trip in four years. That is a
  lifetime for many professional athletes, particularly those who routinely
  operate on a week-to-week basis and are about to enjoy a long-awaited summer
  break. So you would expect someone like England’s Ben Earl to roll his eyes
  and change the subject when asked if he would like to be involved in the
  scheduled next men’s tour to New Zealand in 2029. Instead, the 27-year-old
  flanker sounded as if he would happily jump on a plane to Auckland tomorrow
  morning if asked. “If someone said to me I could go on the next one, I’d do
  anything. Everyone talks about the aura around the badge, the honour … it has
  not been lost on me or anyone else. I’ve seen people potentially play their
  last game in the shirt and what it means. I’d do anything to play for the
  Lions one last time.” Right there, in a red-shirted nutshell, is the reason
  the Lions concept continues to endure. For as long as it remains a priority
  for the players, the old-school dream will live on. For as long as a series
  triumph feels like the ultimate challenge, or at least comparable with winning
  a Rugby World Cup, supporters will also be attracted like, well, bees to a
  honey pot. Even as they fly back north people have already been scribbling
  down their putative 2029 team (see below) on the back of their boarding
  passes. And the usual banter is already starting. Will there be any more than
  a couple of Irish players in a mostly Welsh-dominated squad. What price Owen
  Farrell going on a fifth Lions tour? After all he will only be 37. And so on.
  It is actually an interesting exercise given the probability that a sizeable
  chunk of this year’s tour party are unlikely to return. Even Maro Itoje, who
  will be 34, might conceivably have moved on to a fresh challenge in business
  or politics by then. If so Dan Sheehan, who must be close to establishing
  himself as the world’s best hooker, might well enter the captaincy equation
  with a fit-again, motivated Caelan Doris another possible contender. Beyond
  that there are a good few gaps to fill in. Who will be the tactical driving
  force, for example, if Finn Russell has hung up his Test boots? Fin Smith or
  Sam Prendergast? Might we see Louis Rees-Zammit, minus his gridiron helmet and
  shoulder pads, back in a Lions jersey? And could 2029 be the tour where
  someone like Manny Feyi-Waboso becomes a serious global star if he has not
  already done so at the next Rugby World Cup back in Australia in two years’
  time? Questions, questions. The assumption is that Andy Farrell will be
  reinstalled as head coach having presided over the 2-1 series victory against
  the Wallabies. But if he is otherwise engaged, to whom might the Lions turn?
  Steve Borthwick? Or perhaps Ronan O’Gara, who has worked in New Zealand and
  made no secret of his desire to coach at international level one day. An
  O’Gara-steered Lions tour would certainly not be dull, always assuming his
  present employers La Rochelle were even vaguely on side. All of this idle
  speculation, however, is based on the landscape of global rugby union
  remaining broadly as it is. Which, depending to whom you talk, is by no means
  certain. Those trying to set up the R360 global rebel league, involving a
  Formula One-style calendar of matches in different cities worldwide, are
  actively courting the world’s leading male and female players and claiming it
  will be ready to launch in September next year. Among those said to have been
  approached, for example, are the entire English Red Roses squad, hardly
  surprising given the more modest sums of money on offer in the women’s
  professional game. And if the organisers’ stated objective is to pay the best
  40 men’s players in the world about £1m a year for a much shorter season, you
  can see why a few old-timers near the end of their careers might be
  interested. The catch is that the R360 season could intersect with the Lions
  “window” in rugby’s ever-congested calendar. At which point a few players –
  and remember this is all theoretical – would have a decision to make. Stick
  with tradition in the form of an intense series between the Lions and New
  Zealand or follow the mega money? Welcome to a major clash of cultures and
  philosophies wearily familiar to golf fans since LIV parked its tanks on the
  fairways of the established order. You would hope that the allure of facing
  the All Blacks and following in the footsteps of legends would still count for
  something. Then again, the agents punting the R360 scheme will rightly be
  reminding their clients that careers can be cut short by injury at any moment.
  Earl’s aforementioned words, even so, are worth pinning up on every clubhouse
  wall in Britain and Ireland. Clearly rugby cannot afford to be allergic to
  change but, equally, its soul needs preserving. While the Lions become less
  romantic and more commercially rapacious with each passing year, there remains
  a lot of love for them out there. R360 might be offering eye-watering amounts
  of dosh but you cannot put a price on lifelong friendships and true sporting
  fulfilment. Possible 2029 Lions: B Kinghorn (Scotland); L Rees-Zammit (Wales),
  J Osborne (Ireland), S Tuipulotu (Scotland), M Feyi-Waboso (England); F Smith
  (England), J van Poortvliet (England); A Opoku-Fordjour (England), D Sheehan
  (Ireland), T Clarkson (Ireland), M Itoje (England), J McCarthy (Ireland), T
  Curry (England), J Morgan (Wales), C Doris (Ireland). Replacements: K
  Tuipulotu (England), J Boyle (Ireland), O Chessum (England), H Pollock
  (England), B White (Scotland), S Prendergast (Ireland), T Freeman (England).
