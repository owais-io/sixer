  A cross-party commission including former welfare ministers is urging the
  government to scrap the two-child benefit limit as part of an ambitious “once
  in a generation” plan to lift millions of people out of poverty. The Poverty
  Strategy Commission said billions of pounds of investment – including a boost
  to the rate of universal credit – was needed to reverse record levels of
  poverty in the UK, and tackle longstanding failures over rising hardship and
  destitution. The commission report represents a challenge to the government as
  it prepares to announce its own child poverty reduction strategy, amid
  concerns Treasury-imposed constraints will water down any changes that push up
  benefit spending. The commission said its wide-ranging proposals would lift
  4.2 million people out of poverty, including 2.2 million people stranded in
  “deep poverty” – defined as household income at least 50% below the official
  poverty line and equivalent to £11,013 a year for a single parent with two
  children. Labour ministers such as the welfare minister, Sir Stephen Timms,
  the energy minister, Miatta Fahnbulleh, and policy adviser Graeme Cooke were
  key members of the commission before joining the government. The prisons
  minister, Lord Timpson, is a commission adviser. The independent commission
  was launched three years ago with the ambition of creating a cross-party
  consensus on tackling rising hardship. Its findings offer an authoritative
  mainstream policy blueprint for tackling what it has called the “societal
  failure” to tackle poverty. The commission said abolishing the two-child
  benefit limit, which denies £3,500 a year in welfare payments to third and
  subsequent children born to families on universal credit since 2017, was
  central to reducing poverty and increasing the life chances of the poorest
  youngsters. The government has resisted scrapping the two-child limit on cost
  grounds – estimated at £3bn a year – despite widespread opposition from Labour
  backbenchers, and anti-poverty campaigners. The latest figures show 1.7
  million children live in households affected by the policy. The commission
  says removing the two-child limit would be part of a revamped “basic minimum”
  social security safety net costing an extra £12.5bn a year. Under a new
  “social contract”, the state would guarantee protection from deep poverty to
  any citizen on benefits who meets agreed expectations to find work, work more
  hours and get higher paid jobs. The commission’s final report, expected to be
  published on Thursday, is critical of the government’s attempt this year to
  cut £5bn from disability benefits. It said the now-abandoned plans, which
  would have pushed 250,000 disabled people into poverty, indicated “a failure
  to grasp the challenge [of poverty reduction] effectively”. The commission
  estimates nearly a quarter of the UK population, including 36% of children,
  are in poverty. Its says its proposals, which include investment in housing
  and childcare, will lead to a “never-before-seen reduction in the scale and
  nature of poverty”. Its membership includes figures from the political right,
  including Philippa Stroud, a Tory peer and former adviser to Iain Duncan
  Smith; and the former Tory welfare secretary Stephen Crabb. David Laws, a
  Liberal Democrat schools minister in the 2010-2015 coalition government, is
  also a member. Stroud said the government’s proposed disability benefit
  changes failed because ministers “did not have a story to tell” about why they
  were doing them. “If you have not got a narrative on poverty then you run into
  the kinds of problems they [ministers] did on disability benefit cuts,” she
  said. The commission did not publish cost estimates of its plans although its
  interim report in 2023 put the figure at £36bn a year. The commission says
  fiscal constraints are not an excuse for failing to tackle poverty, and over
  time investment in doing so would drive higher economic growth and
  productivity. Helen Barnard, a commission member and director of policy at the
  food bank charity Trussell, said: “We are seeing more people trapped in severe
  and sustained poverty, turning to food banks because they have nowhere else to
  go. This hardship damages individuals, families, communities and the UK’s
  economy and public services.” A government spokesperson said: “This government
  is determined to drive down poverty and ensure that every child gets the best
  start in life. We are overhauling jobcentres and reforming the broken welfare
  system to support people into good, secure jobs, while always protecting those
  who need it most. “In addition to extending free school meals and ensuring the
  poorest children don’t go hungry in the holidays through a new £1bn crisis
  support package, our child poverty taskforce will publish an ambitious
  strategy to tackle the structural and root causes of child poverty across the
  country.”
