  Nothing speaks so eloquently of the rundown state of Britain than potholes on
  the roads. Motorists rightly complain of the damage caused to their vehicles.
  Cyclists risk serious injury every time they mount their bikes. Increased road
  use from a rising population is one reason for the problem. Cuts to repair
  budgets are another. Fixing the problem will be expensive, with one estimate
  putting the cost of mending potholes in England and Wales at a hefty £17bn.
  Complaints about the state of the roads have made governments reluctant to
  arouse the ire of motoring lobby groups by raising fuel excise duty – the tax
  paid at the pump on fuel. The last chancellor to do so was Alistair Darling 15
  years ago. The cumulative cost to the exchequer of the freezes and cuts to
  fuel duty since 2010 is put at £130bn – a colossal sum given the struggle
  governments have had to balance the books during that time. In reality, the
  days are numbered for fuel duty. Of the 34m vehicles on the UK’s roads, 1.6m
  are fully electric, but that figure will rise steadily over time. Once petrol
  and diesel vehicles are phased out completely, the £24.4bn currently raised
  from fuel duty will dwindle to zero. That represents a sizeable and permanent
  hit to the public finances. Rachel Reeves has more immediate things to worry
  about. The weakness of the economy means the chancellor is at grave risk of
  breaking her self-imposed rule that day-to-day government spending should be
  matched by tax receipts. Reeves fears that breaking the rule would incur the
  wrath of the financial markets, while cutting spending would incur the wrath
  of Labour MPs. So she is scrabbling around for tax increases that don’t break
  Labour’s manifesto commitment not to raise the rates of income tax, VAT or
  employee national insurance contributions. This is not going to be easy. One
  estimate last week said Reeves will need to find more than £50bn to stick to
  her fiscal rule with a reasonable margin for error. Even though other
  forecasts suggest the figure may be lower than that, there will still be
  difficult choices to make. Faced with these pressures, Reeves should do two
  things. First, she should end the freeze on fuel duty, which has been kept in
  place no matter whether the cost of petrol and diesel is high or low. It is
  not just that Reeves could well do with the several billion pounds that a rise
  in fuel duty would harvest. Fuel duty is now a third lower, in real terms,
  than it was when Darling was at the Treasury, effectively cutting the cost of
  motoring and so creating incentives to drive more. Increased congestion and
  the potholed roads are consequences of that. The stated rationale for the
  protracted freeze since 2010 is that it helps hard-pressed motorists, but the
  main beneficiaries have not been white-van man but the better off, who drive
  more, own more vehicles and buy gas-guzzling SUVs. The richest fifth of
  households have benefited twice as much from the fuel duty freeze as the
  poorest fifth. Raising fuel duty in the budget should be a no-brainer for
  Reeves. But the chancellor also needs to come up with a plan for what to do
  once the era of all-electric vehicles finally arrives, and here there is an
  obvious solution: road pricing. Conceptually, there should be little problem
  with this idea. People expect to pay more for a train journey in rush hours.
  Hotels charge more for rooms on a Friday or Saturday when demand is higher.
  The same principle should apply to roads. There are reasons why ministers are
  reluctant to grasp this nettle. Fuel duty, while a regressive tax, is easy to
  understand. There are no issues with privacy and surveillance, as there would
  be with road pricing. Governments are sensitive to charges that they are
  planning to wage war on motorists. Given that only 5% of vehicles are electric
  currently, the transition may take longer than originally envisaged. No
  question, doing nothing has its attractions. But the costs of inaction will
  grow over time. A report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI)
  said the loss of tax revenue from cars would be £10bn by 2030, £20bn by 2035
  and £30bn by 2040. This would inevitably lead to chunky tax increases.
  Reducing the cost of motoring by continually freezing fuel duty would lead to
  more and longer traffic jams. Those still driving petrol and diesel vehicles
  would face a triple whammy: spending longer in traffic; paying higher taxes
  elsewhere to compensate for the lost fuel-duty revenue from those who
  transferred to electric vehicles; and paying three to four times more for tax
  and fuel than those who drive EVs. The TBI report outlined the four ways road
  pricing might work. Drivers could face a flat-rate charge for each mile they
  drive; costs could vary according to geographic area or specific roads, with
  costs increased in areas where congestion was higher; road users could be
  charged for each minute they spend driving; and finally an “Uberised” model,
  where charges vary dynamically on the road used and the time of travel.
  Technically, it would be possible to make any of the approaches – or a
  combination of them – work. It speaks volumes that the report was published
  four years ago this month, since when inertia has reigned supreme. That needs
  to change because the do-nothing option is really no option at all. Larry
