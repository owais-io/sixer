  digging’

  Mikel Arteta has insisted Arsenal will strike gold if they “keep digging” as
  they start their push to win a first Premier League title since 2004 with a
  trip to Manchester United on Sunday. In May, Arsenal completed a run of
  finishing second in three successive Premier League campaigns – matching the
  club’s record from 1998-99 to 2000-01, before winning the title in 2001-02.
  They have spent almost £200m on players this summer. Viktor Gyökeres is
  expected to lead the line against United and the midfielder Martín Zubimendi
  is also likely to make his debut. Arteta’s side face a tricky run, with a trip
  to the champions, Liverpool, in their third match, before they face Manchester
  City at home on 21 September. But the Arsenal manager insisted they could draw
  on their previous experience to get over the line. “You keep digging, digging,
  digging and you have to be digging because one day the gold is going to be
  there,” he said. “That’s all the time. When I’ve been taught, when I’ve been
  educated, that’s it. For three seasons we’ve had more points than any other
  team in this league, which is incredible. That’s how you have all the
  consistency. Now we have to do it in a season to have one more point or the
  same amount of points and more goals different than any other team. That’s the
  objective.” City have actually accumulated four more points than Arsenal’s 247
  over the past three seasons. Those clubs have spent similar gross amounts this
  summer but Liverpool have outstripped them and could add to their squad.
  Arteta confirmed Arsenal were also looking to bring in more players amid
  interest in Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze but believes they are capable of
  competing regardless. “I think we have great versatility, very different
  qualities in relation to the opposition as well,” he said. “We can manipulate
  that and have some great cohesion within those units so we are very happy with
  that.” The form of Martin Ødegaard will be crucial after he endured a testing
  season that yielded only three goals and eight assists in the league. Arteta
  said that despite suggestions from Tony Adams – who led Arsenal to the Double
  in 2002 – that Declan Rice should take over the captaincy, the Norwegian was
  the almost unanimous choice in a vote conducted this week by his staff and the
  rest of the players. “My opinion is clear and it’s not just my opinion, it’s
  all the staff and especially the players,” he said.
