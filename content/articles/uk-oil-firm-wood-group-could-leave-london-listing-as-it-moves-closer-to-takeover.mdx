  Wood Group has come a step closer to becoming the latest company to leave the
  London Stock Exchange, after the board of the British oil services company
  said it was minded to accept a reduced takeover offer from a Dubai-based
  suitor. Sidara, the Middle Eastern engineering company Dar Al-Handasah
  Consultants Shair and Partner Holdings, initially proposed a 35p a share offer
  in April. However, on Tuesday the company said that having completed due
  diligence Sidara would make a lower offer of 30p a share, once remaining
  preconditions had been met. The FTSE 250-listed company said it had evaluated
  the new offer with its financial advisers and concluded that it was “at a
  value the board would be minded to recommend to shareholders”. As a result the
  deadline for Sidara to announce a firm intention or withdraw its offer has
  been extended, again, to 5pm on 28 August. Last month, it was reported that
  Sidara was considering reducing its offer price after the UK’s Financial
  Conduct Authority launched an investigation into Wood Group’s finances. In
  March, Wood Group admitted that its financial results needed to be restated
  after a review found “cultural failings” led to information being withheld
  from its auditors. On Tuesday, Wood Group said it was continuing to work with
  auditors on the publication of the company’s accounts for last year. Sidara
  has made a number of attempts to buy the Aberdeen-based engineering and
  consultancy company, which employs 35,000 people. Last year, the company made
  a 230p a share offer, valuing Wood Group at £1.58bn, but pulled out months
  later citing “rising geopolitical risks and financial market uncertainty”.
  Wood Group’s shares were suspended at the start of May, when they were trading
  at 18p, down from highs of almost 880p less than a decade ago. Nearly two
  years ago, Wood rejected a series of bids from the US fund manager Apollo
  Global Management, whose final proposal offered 240p a share, or £1.7bn. The
  probable takeover of Wood Group would be the latest blow to London’s
  beleaguered stock market. In June, the online payments company Wise said it
  would move its main share listing to the US. Last year, the construction
  equipment rental company Ashtead announced it would move its primary listing
  to the US, following companies such as the gambling group Flutter
  Entertainment and the building materials provider CRH. The drugmaker Indivior
  has also said it planned to cancel the secondary listing it had retained in
  London after switching its main stock listing to the US last year. Metal
  investment company Cobalt Holdings scrapped its move to list in London, which
  was expected to have raised about $230m (£170m).
