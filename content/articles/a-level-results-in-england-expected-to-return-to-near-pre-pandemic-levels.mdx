  Students in England are expected to receive A-level grades that are closer to
  normal for the first time since the Covid pandemic triggered school closures
  and exam cancellations. The grades will more closely resemble those given out
  in 2019, before the pandemic, with the proportion of A* to E grades linked to
  national results from the GCSE exams taken by the same pupils two years ago.
  While most of the students who sat A-levels this spring were affected by
  pandemic disruption during their early years at secondary school, they will be
  the first group to have gone through their exam years without major
  turbulence. It comes as the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, pledged
  to make a priority of tackling British white working-class young people
  falling behind their peers in the year ahead. The government will set out its
  plans for the challenge in a schools white paper in the autumn, she added.
  Prof Alan Smithers, of Buckingham University’s centre for education and
  employment research, said that 2024’s A-level grades were unexpectedly high in
  England, which could have echoes in this year’s outcomes. “A-level grades have
  a chance to settle down this year after the volatility of Covid and its
  aftermath. They are likely to be close to last year’s, where top grades were a
  percentage point or two above pre-Covid levels. This may not sound very much
  but, in fact, was an extra 14,200 A*s and 21,300 A*-As,” Smithers said. “But
  there is huge variation in grades between subjects, a changing pattern in
  entries, and movement in the subject distribution of the sexes, which could
  also influence the outcome.” The proportion of top A* and As awarded soared
  after grades were set by school assessment in 2020 and 2021, and remained at
  higher levels when exams returned in 2022. But last year 9.3% of A-level
  entries in England gained A* grades, above pre-pandemic levels, leaving
  experts struggling to explain why. Analysts at FFT Datalab research unit said
  there were fewer students taking A-levels this year after record numbers in
  2024, as entry patterns stabilised after the bumper post-pandemic crop of
  students who received better GCSE grades, enabling more of them to enrol on
  A-level courses. This year, career-related subjects such as business studies
  and economics will overtake traditional academic subjects such as history,
  while the sciences and maths continue to rise in popularity despite the fall
  in the numbers taking A-levels overall. Just 40,900 students entered to take
  history, compared with 41,900 taking economics and 43,000 for physics. Maths
  remains the most popular A-level with 105,000 entries this year, up by more
  than 4% compared with 2024. English literature entries fell by 5% to below
  35,000, while the numbers taking French and German continued to decline. About
  250,000 sixth-formers in England will receive their A-level results on
  Thursday, with others choosing to take BTecs or other standalone or vocational
  qualifications such as T-levels. Students in Wales and Northern Ireland will
  receive their A-level results on the same day but their grades are
  administered separately from those in England. Scotland published the results
  for its Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications last week, showing a record
  number receiving grades A to C in Highers. School leavers in England hoping to
  go to university have received higher numbers of offers as institutions have
  aggressively sought to fill places after a downturn in international
  applications. Universities usually offer places on undergraduate courses that
  are conditional on reaching certain A-level grades. But Mike Nicholson,
  director of recruitment, admissions and participation at the University of
  Cambridge, said many universities would probably be “looking very carefully”
  at accepting applicants who narrowly failed to achieve the required grades.
  Nicholson said: “If the student, for instance, needed three As [and] gets AAB,
  as long as the B is not in something that’s absolutely crucial for the course,
  I think there’s a very strong possibility the student would find they’d be
  getting a place. “If universities have the capacity to take near-miss students
  I think they’ll be very keen to take them this year because those students are
  already in the system, they’ve already committed, they’ve possibly already
  even applied for accommodation. Phillipson said it was a “national disgrace”
  that so many young people were “written off” and did not get what they needed
  in the education system to achieve and thrive after leaving school. She added
  her focus would be turning around the “stark” attainment gap and outcomes
  between white working-class children and their peers. Fewer than a fifth
  (18.6%) of white British pupils eligible for free school meals achieved at
  least a grade 5 – which is considered a “strong pass” – in their English and
  maths GCSEs in 2023-24, compared with 45.9% of all state school pupils in
  England, according to Department for Education (DfE) data. Phillipson said:
  “They’re not well-positioned to carry on with studies, to get an
  apprenticeship, to go on to university. That is why the schools white paper we
  will be publishing in the autumn will set out an ambitious vision for how we
  can tackle this generational challenge of what many young people experience.
  “(It) is a national disgrace that so many young people are written off and
  don’t get what they need to achieve and thrive.”
