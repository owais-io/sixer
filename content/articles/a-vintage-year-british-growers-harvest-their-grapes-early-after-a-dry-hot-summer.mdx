  UK vineyards are getting ready for a vintage year – and a very early harvest –
  with the warm, sunny weather caused by the heating climate delivering strong
  flavours in their grapes. Across the UK the total amount of wine produced is
  likely to be up on last year. English growers alone added more than 1,000
  hectares of vines in 2024, taking the total to 4,841, of which 3,763 was in
  active production in 2024, according to the industry body Wine GB. Winemaking
  in the UK has expanded rapidly in recent years owing to farmers in Europe
  facing increasingly erratic weather prompted by the climate crisis, including
  droughts and extreme heat. The UK industry is also recovering after a dire
  2024 in which production shrank to 10.7m bottles, from 21.6m the year before,
  after “inclement weather and recurrent rainfall” led to more disease, such as
  downy mildew, according to a recent WineGB report. Harvest yields are expected
  to vary depending on the region: growers in the south-west of England, for
  example, expect an average yield but exceptional flavours; producers in the
  north-west and Wales are predicting strong yields. The UK’s biggest wine
  region, in the south-east of England, is expected to be up on last year but
  lower than average. Nyetimber, one of the UK’s biggest producers, which is
  based in West Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, said production was likely to be
  down as its vines were still recovering from last summer’s cool, damp
  conditions, while Gusbourne, which has 60 hectares in Kent, said its harvest
  would be up on last year but lower than average, partly because of the lack of
  rain. Some growers predicted that the weather meant they were more likely to
  be able to produce large quantities of vintage still wine, which requires
  riper grapes than sparkling wine. Sam Lindo, winemaker at Camel Valley, in
  Cornwall, said: “The recent dry weather has meant excellent ripening which
  will be great for still wine this year. It isn’t often we can ripen chardonnay
  and pinot blanc to still wine levels so it’s an exciting year for winemaking.”
  Duncan Schwab, at Sandridge Barton, in Devon, expected to harvest in early
  September, two weeks early, after early flowering and the long, warm and sunny
  summer. He said that while the weather had been quite dry, there has been just
  enough rain to produce a decent crop. “This year the heat has been just
  perfect. “It will be nowhere near the bumper year in 2023 but a lot better
  than 2024,” he said. The grapes had “really good phenolics” – a reference to
  the compounds that contribute to the taste and colour of wine, with this
  year’s weather producing a good balance of sugars and acidity. Jonathan White,
  at Gusbourne, was also expecting an early harvest and good flavours. “It has
  been really dry and warm and where we are there has been a really high amount
  of sunshine hours which is crucial in the ability to ripen grapes and to
  produce high-quality, world-class wines,” he said. “We are anticipating a
  good-quality vintage.” Though he added that fingers would have to be crossed
  for good weather in the final of weeks before harvest. Ian Sargent, chair of
  WineGB in the Midlands and north, said: “Everyone is looking at harvest
  potentially being two weeks ahead, and with excellent ripeness. A lot are also
  predicting an above-average yield.” Nyetimber, which has 11 vineyards spanning
  425 hectares, said a “very warm and sunny spring for the UK, then a hot and
  dry June, [means] flowering conditions in the south-east of England have been
  optimal”. “Although the next few weeks will still prove crucial, the outlook
  is positive,” it added. Despite the sunny summer, the company said it expected
  yields to be slightly down on last year, but even a “modest harvest” of 1.6m
  to 1.8m bottles of Nyetimber would nearly triple the number produced in 2015
  because of the addition of new vineyards. Cherie Spriggs, head winemaker at
  Nyetimber, said: “The growing conditions this year have been exceptionally
  favourable and very reminiscent of 2018, which was a very successful vintage
  for us. 2025 is definitely looking like it could produce some fantastic
  vintage wines. “Of course, all of this comes with the caveat that we hope
  Mother Nature remains on our side. We have an excellent climate for sparkling
  wine production, but it can still be unpredictable – so we never get ahead of
  ourselves too early.”
