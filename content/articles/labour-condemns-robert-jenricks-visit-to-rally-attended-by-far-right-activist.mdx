  Robert Jenrick has been severely criticised by Labour after the shadow justice
  secretary was pictured at an anti-asylum rally in Essex attended by a veteran
  far-right activist. Jenrick posted photos on X showing himself visiting the
  protest outside the Bell hotel in Epping, where police have been attacked and
  police vehicles vandalised by groups of men taking part in the demonstration.
  The MP met protesters including a woman with a T-shirt bearing the message:
  “Send them home.” Eddy Butler, a well-known figure in far-right circles who
  was a key strategist in the rise of the British National party, can be seen
  wearing sunglasses in the background of one of the photos Jenrick shared after
  the visit. It is not clear whether Jenrick met Butler, but the photo was
  seized on by far-right figures eager to exploit the protest, which they have
  heavily promoted. Butler boasted to friends about Jenrick’s appearance in a
  post on his Facebook account: “At the Bell Hotel, riding shotgun for Robert
  Jenrick, pretender to the Tory leadership.” A Labour party spokesperson
  described Jenrick as “a disgrace” for attending a protest “organised by a
  far-right party”, which was also attended by someone with “a long history of
  involvement with neo-Nazi groups”. “Jenrick once proudly boasted about ramping
  up the procurement of asylum hotels when he was immigration minister. It
  shows, at best, a staggering lack of judgment,” the spokesperson said. “Kemi
  Badenoch must show some leadership, explain what action she’s going to take
  against her shadow justice secretary, and demonstrate that she is strong
  enough to stand up against this challenge to her authority and to basic
  decency.” A source close to Jenrick insisted that the MP had “no idea” who the
  former BNP strategist was and did not speak to him at the protest rally.
  Jenrick said in his post on X: “Great to be with peaceful, patriotic
  protesters in Epping today. “People are right to be fed up of illegal
  migration. And the crime and billions being wasted because of it.” Lewis
  Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, which has been organising
  counter-protests in Epping, said Jenrick was willing to go on protests
  attended by far-right activists. “These aren’t ‘concerned parents’ or ‘local
  residents’. Jenrick is fanning the flames of the far right by chasing Reform
  UK votes – and he’s giving confidence to known fascists.” Butler, a former
  member of the National Front, has been a prominent figure in the British far
  right for decades, helping to guide the BNP during the 1990s and 2000s. In
  1992 he helped establish a BNP “stewards” group, made up of skinheads and
  hooligans, to act as “security” against antifascists. This group became the
  neo-Nazi terrorist group Combat 18, according to Hope Not Hate.
