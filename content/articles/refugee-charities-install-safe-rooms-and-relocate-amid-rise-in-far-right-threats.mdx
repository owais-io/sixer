  threats

  Refugee support organisations have been forced to install safe rooms in their
  premises, relocate to less visible sites and in some cases close their offices
  in response to the threat of far-right violence. Half of NGOs and charities
  supporting people seeking refuge have faced threats, a “hostile environment”
  of protest and safety concerns since the riots of 2024, according to research
  documents seen by the Guardian. Some heads of the organisations have also
  received “credible death threats”, a claim supported by police sources. The
  organisations that were polled support tens of thousands of asylum seekers,
  refugees and other migrants. The threats have emerged as Keir Starmer faces a
  growing clamour from councils to block hotels being used to house asylum
  seekers through legal action, after a court ruled that more than 100
  applicants staying in Essex should be moved. Data released on Thursday showed
  the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels had risen by 8% to 32,059
  in a year. Despite many people coming from countries known for serious human
  rights abuses and conflict, rates of asylum being granted to people coming
  from such countries as Afghanistan, Iran and Eritrea, for example, remain low
  compared with recent years. The safety concerns set out in the report are so
  grave that an internal Home Office meeting is due to take place imminently to
  discuss growing concerns about similar problems. The organisations have been
  forced to take radical steps to protect themselves and their clients in recent
  months, including temporarily closing their physical offices and moving to an
  online-only service and removing content from their websites including
  location information. Coordination with police and other authorities has
  increased and in some cases officers have installed new CCTV close to refugee
  organisations so that any attacks or incidents of harassment can be captured
  on camera. During the course of the research, multiple organisations reported
  online threats, trolling, hostile emails and intimidating Facebook posts. Some
  anti-migrant protesters made video recordings of refugee organisation premises
  and shared them in far-right online groups, with one NGO named on a far-right
  hitlist having to close temporarily, while some received harassing phone calls
  and threatening messages. One NGO that took part in the survey said: “We have
  had to create a safe room where all of us could be contained in the event of
  an attack while the police arrived.” “The hostile environment has to be
  dismantled,” said another. A third added: “There is concern that the
  government is parroting far-right lines instead of adopting their own
  anti-racist stance. This is extremely disappointing.” The briefing has emerged
  at a time when the refugee sector is under unprecedented strain. Those working
  in the field say they have never known things to be so bad and many are now
  refusing to be quoted publicly for fear of attracting more attacks. The
  Charity Commission has taken the highly unusual step of removing the names of
  trustees from several charities listed on its website. It did so after the
  Home Office gave a far-right influencer the names of some organisations with
  which it had had meetings about asylum accommodation, following a freedom of
  information request. While a spokesperson said it was not possible to comment
  on individual cases, removing trustee names is highly unusual. According to
  Charity Commission guidance, it happens only if the commission grants a
  dispensation: “We can grant a dispensation if displaying an individual’s name
  could put the relevant person or people in personal physical or mental danger.
  Dispensations will not be granted automatically.” One example of the recent
  hostility targeted at organisations is provided by City of Sanctuary UK, which
  was falsely accused of grooming schoolchildren for the benefit of adult male
  asylum seekers. Schools supportive of the organisation carried out an annual
  arts activity where children make cards to send to refugees around Valentine’s
  Day with the message: “showing your heart for refugees”. The event was part of
  a broader refugees welcome campaign that is symbolised by orange hearts. The
  children did not sign their names on their cards and the anonymous messages
  were then passed on to refugees the children will never meet as a generic
  message of welcome. The former Conservative education secretary Gavin
  Williamson has made a complaint to the Charity Commission about the activity,
  claiming that it is politicised. Far-right activists have accused City of
  Sanctuary of grooming children for the benefit of adult male asylum seekers. A
  spokesperson for City of Sanctuary UK said: “Our work has been deliberately
  misrepresented by a dangerous campaign built on false and inflammatory claims.
  These attacks not only put our staff and the school communities we support at
  risk, but are part of a wider strategy: to sow division and fuel hostility
  towards people seeking sanctuary. This is not just an attack on us – it is an
  attack on the values of compassion, safety and solidarity.” A Charity
  Commission spokesperson said: “Concerns have been raised with us about alleged
  political activity linked to City of Sanctuary. We are currently assessing the
  information available to determine if there is a regulatory role for us.” On
  Thursday, a series of St George’s crosses were painted on pedestrian crossings
  near a Canary Wharf hotel, where asylum seekers are planned to be housed. The
  latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of the usual
  quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour’s first year in office. There
  were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June, up from 29,585 at
  the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power, but
  down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March. For the first time in
  four years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people.
  It is now just above 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by
  18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021. Epping Forest
  district council in Essex, which was granted an interim injunction blocking
  the use of the Bell hotel as asylum accommodation, went from housing 28 asylum
  seekers in hotels in its area in March this year, to 199 by the end of June. A
  Home Office spokesperson said: “We strongly condemn any form of harassment or
  intimidation. Anyone who engages in such behaviour can expect to face the full
  force of the law.”
