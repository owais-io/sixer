  The hisses, pings and screeches that introduced millions of Americans to the
  nascent online world are to be formally retired when AOL’s dial-up internet
  shuts down in late September. AOL, or America Online, said recently it was
  discontinuing the old school connection option after an evaluation of its
  products and services and that it would no longer support dial-up software
  starting 30 September. The date portends the end of an era for millions of
  Americans of a certain age: millennials, gen Xers, boomers and those of the
  greatest generation. The characteristic sound of modems conducting an analog
  handshake to establish a connection was a preliminary soundtrack to a new
  world of instant connection, wires, handheld computer mice, emails, chatrooms,
  instant messages and glowing screens. The dial-up internet wasn’t invented by
  a single person. A predecessor, Usenet, was developed in the late 1970s and
  used a dial-up system. UK and US universities launched their own connected
  networks in the 1980s. In 1979, CompuServe began “offering a dial-up online
  information service to consumers”. By the mid 1980s, with the Well, or the
  Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link, launched in the Bay Area by Stewart Brand and
  Larry Brilliant, virtual communities began to form. At the same time, in 1985,
  America Online was founded. At its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, AOL
  had over 23 million subscribers in the US, making it the dominant internet
  service provider at the time. According to Jigso AI, it was estimated to have
  gained a new user every six seconds. America Online became so dominant – with
  its equally characteristic but more cheery “You’ve got mail” message – that in
  1999 it acquired Time Warner in a massive $165bn all-stock deal that later
  became regarded as one of the most disastrous deals in media and
  communications history. By then, the introduction of faster cable internet
  service in 1995 that relied on existing cable TV infrastructure made the
  characteristic handshake of dial-up begin to disappear. Currently, only a
  small fraction of US households – about 175,000 – still rely on dial-up for
  internet access and web browser platforms. Web browsers themselves could be
  becoming a relic of the 1990s, when they were subject to fierce wars between
  Microsoft and Netscape, with the advent of apps. App-based AI has also started
  to encroach on browsers’ territory. The growth of dial-up internet – sometimes
  attributed in part to demand for pornography – and its subsequent decline to
  faster internet services, may now be mourned in concert with other pop
  cultural relics of decades past, including CDs, pagers and landlines. • This
  article was amended on 25 August 2025 to clarify details about the origins of
  dial-up internet.
