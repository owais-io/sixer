  Football has become the country’s soap opera. It’s a point David Goldblatt
  makes in his new book Injury Time: it seems absurd to think now that in 2001,
  the BBC persuaded Uefa to delay kick-off of a Champions League tie between
  Liverpool and Barcelona so viewers could first find out who shot Phil
  Mitchell. By 2020, EastEnders was being bumped from its slot in the schedules
  for an FA Cup fifth-round tie between Liverpool and Chelsea. As the big
  television soaps have declined, it is football that has become the great
  national obsession, not just in terms of what happens on the pitch but also
  the endless politicking off it. Nothing could exemplify that better than
  Sunday’s game at Selhurst Park, a curiously patchy and unsatisfactory draw
  played out in an atmosphere of fraught tetchiness. Crystal Palace and
  Nottingham Forest are two very respectable clubs with fine traditions, but
  there is no great history between them. If a Palace v Forest fixture resonates
  at all in the collective memory it is only for the series of FA Cup
  third-round meetings in 1991: it was after the first replay that Brian Clough
  laid out Roy Keane with a punch after an under hit backpass gave up an
  equaliser, and in the second, with Forest 3-0 up, that Clough substituted
  Steve Hodge for nobody, apparently to make a point about the ineffectiveness
  of Palace’s direct style, although it also damaged his relationship with the
  midfielder. When the sides met at Selhurst Park on the final day of 2023-24
  the mood was notably friendly, as fans of the clubs celebrated their survival
  together. Yet the buildup to this fixture on Sunday was full of bitterness and
  intrigue, with Palace blaming Forest for their demotion from the Europa League
  to the Conference League and Forest locked in what, to an outsider, appears a
  needless internecine dispute between manager and owner. Nuno Espírito Santo,
  reiterating that he would never walk away from Forest, spoke of the need for
  him, the owner Evangelos Marinakis and Edu, the global head of football for
  Marinakis’s multiclub organisation, to clear the air for the good of the club.
  He himself, though, had spoken of there being no smoke without fire when asked
  on Friday about rumours that his job was under threat. Whatever Nuno’s
  frustrations with Marinakis, his plaintive talk of how they no longer speak
  every day, they are as nothing beside those of Palace fans, who spent a
  healthy part of the buildup and game abusing him, his private habits and his
  appearance. Marinakis himself was not at Selhurst Park on Sunday. It’s not
  just that Forest have taken Palace’s place in the Europa League, or that
  Marinakis wrote a letter to Uefa urging them to take action against Palace,
  it’s that Marinakis has a business relationship with John Textor, whose
  ownership of Lyon through Eagle Holdings along with his now-offloaded stake in
  Palace put them in breach of Uefa regulations. Textor appeared on the banner
  as a clown, juggling his various clubs. The outrage if Igor Jesus, signed by
  Forest for a very reasonable fee from one of Textor’s other clubs, Botafogo,
  had scored an injury-time winner would have been apocalyptic, a dramatic
  flourish too far. Perhaps fortunately for everybody, his effort pinged against
  the inside of the post. Palace’s sense of grievance, of being punished for a
  technical breach that has since been resolved while actual multiclub groups
  use blind trusts as a workaround, is only heightened by the fact that Forest
  are themselves part of a multiclub model. That Olympiakos won the Greek league
  to qualify for Champions League meant the blind trust Forest had entered into
  was a needless bureaucratic contingency. The hostility of Palace fans, it was
  very noticeable, was directed at Marinakis rather than at Forest. That in
  itself is telling, given it implies a distinction between the club and its
  owner and, perhaps, hints at a broader solidarity among fans, a sense of
  everybody being pawns in a rich man’s game. Certainly the focus on Marinakis
  and ownership feels like a departure. There probably were chants about Robert
  Maxwell when he owned Oxford and Derby in the 80s, but he was an unusually
  prominent public figure: however outspoken the likes of Bob Lord, Sam Longson
  and Peter Swales may have been, it wouldn’t even have occurred to opposing
  fans to direct sustained abuse in their direction. A game about players,
  having become a game about coaches, is now very clearly a game about owners
  and directors. Which, of course, is great news for the drama; as shows from
  Dynasty to Succession have proved, there’s nothing quite so compelling as the
  machinations of people in suits. The grand soap opera goes on.
