  Ximena had a plan. The 18-year-old from Houston was going to start college in
  the fall at the University of Texas at Tyler, where she had been awarded
  $10,000 a year in scholarships. That, she hoped, would set her up for her
  dream: a PhD in chemistry, followed by a career as a professor or researcher.
  “And then the change to in-state tuition happened, and that’s when I knew for
  sure that I had to pivot,” said Ximena, who is from Mexico but has attended
  schools in the US since kindergarten. (The Guardian and its partner the
  Hechinger Report, which produced this story, is using her first name only
  because she fears retaliation for her immigration status.) In June, the Texas
  attorney general’s office and the Trump administration worked together to end
  the provisions in a state law that had offered thousands of undocumented
  students like Ximena lower in-state tuition rates at Texas public colleges.
  State and federal officials successfully argued in court that the longstanding
  policy discriminated against out-of-state US citizens who paid a higher rate.
  That rationale has now been replicated in similar lawsuits against Kentucky,
  Oklahoma and Minnesota – part of a broader offensive against immigrants’
  access to public education. At UT Tyler, in-state tuition and fees for the
  upcoming academic year total $9,736, compared to more than $25,000 for
  out-of-state students. Ximena and her family couldn’t afford the higher
  tuition bill, so she withdrew. Instead, she enrolled at Houston Community
  College, where out-of-state costs are $227 per semester hour, nearly three
  times the in-district rate. The school offers only basic college-level
  chemistry classes, so to set herself up for a doctorate or original research,
  Ximena will still need to find a way to pay for a four-year university down
  the line. Her predicament is exactly what state lawmakers from both political
  parties had hoped to avoid when they passed the Texas Dream Act, 2001
  legislation that not only opened doors to higher education for undocumented
  students but was also meant to bolster Texas’s economy and its workforce in
  the long term. With that law, Texas became the first of more than two dozen
  states to implement in-state tuition for undocumented students, and for nearly
  24 years, the landmark policy remained intact. Conservative lawmakers
  repeatedly proposed to repeal it, but despite years of single-party control in
  the state legislature, not enough Republicans embraced repeal even as recently
  as this spring, days before the Texas attorney general’s office and the
  federal Department of Justice moved to end it. Now, as the fall semester
  approaches, immigrant students are weighing whether to disenroll from their
  courses or await clarity on how the consent agreement entered into by the
  state and justice department affects them. Immigration advocates are worried
  that Texas colleges and universities are boxing out potential attendees who
  are lawfully present and still qualify for in-state tuition despite the court
  ruling – including recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
  (Daca) program, asylum applicants and temporary protected status holders –
  because university personnel lack immigration expertise and haven’t been given
  clear guidelines on exactly who needs to pay the higher tuition rate. At
  Austin Community College (ACC), members of the board of trustees are unsure
  how to accurately implement the ruling. As they await answers, they have so
  far decided against sending letters asking their students for sensitive
  information in order to determine tuition rates. “This confusion will
  inevitably harm students because what we find is that in the absence of
  information and in the presence of fear and anxiety, students will opt to not
  continue higher education,” said Manuel Gonzalez, vice-chair of the ACC board
  of trustees. Policy experts, meanwhile, warn that Texas’s workforce could
  suffer as talented young people, many of whom have spent their entire
  education in the state’s public school system, will no longer be able to
  afford the associate’s and bachelor’s degrees that would allow them to pursue
  careers that would help propel their local economies. Under the Texas Dream
  Act, beneficiaries were required to commit to applying for lawful permanent
  residence as soon as possible, giving them the opportunity to hold down jobs
  related to their degrees. Even without legal immigration status, it’s likely
  they will still work – just in lower-paying, under-the-radar jobs. “It’s so
  short-sighted in terms of the welfare of the state of Texas,” said Barbara
  Hines, a former law school professor who helped legislators craft the Texas
  Dream Act. The legislation was first introduced in the state’s lower chamber
  by retired army national guard Maj Gen Rick Noriega, a Democrat who served in
  the Texas legislature from 1999 to 2009, after he learned of a young yard
  worker in his district who wanted to enroll at the local community college for
  aviation mechanics but could not afford out-of-state tuition. Noriega called
  the school chancellor’s office, which was able to provide funding for the
  student to attend. But that experience led him to wonder: how many more kids
  in his district were running up against the same barriers to higher education?
  So he worked with a sociologist to poll students at local high schools about
  the problem, which turned out to be widespread. And Noriega’s district wasn’t
  an outlier. In a state that has long had one of the nation’s largest
  unauthorized immigrant populations, politicians across the partisan divide
  knew affected constituents, friends or family members and wanted to help. Once
  Noriega decided to propose legislation, a Republican, Fred Hill, asked to
  serve as a joint author on the bill. The legislation easily passed the Texas
  house, which was Democratic-controlled at the time, but the Republican-led
  senate was less accommodating. “I couldn’t even get a hearing,” said Leticia
  Van de Putte, the then state senator who sponsored the legislation in her
  chamber. To persuade her Republican colleagues, she added several
  restrictions, including requiring undocumented students to live in Texas for
  three years before finishing high school or receiving a GED. (Three years was
  estimated as the average time it would take a family to pay enough in state
  taxes to make up the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition.)
  She also included the clause mandating that undocumented students who accessed
  in-state tuition sign an affidavit pledging to pursue green cards as soon as
  they were able. Van de Putte turned to Texas business groups to hammer home
  the economic case for the bill. And she convinced the business community to
  pay for buses to bring Latino evangelical conservative pastors from Dallas,
  San Antonio, Houston and other areas to Austin, so they could knock on doors
  in support of the legislation and pray with Republican senators and their
  staff. After that, the Texas Dream Act overwhelmingly passed the state senate
  in May 2001, and the then governor, Rick Perry, a Republican, signed it into
  law the following month. Yet by 2012, a new slew of rightwing politicians was
  elected to office, many philosophically opposed to the law – and loud about
  it. Perry’s defense of the policy came back to haunt him during the 2012
  Republican presidential primary, when his campaign was dogged by criticism
  after he told opponents of tuition equity during a debate: “I don’t think you
  have a heart.” Still, none of the many bills introduced over the years to
  repeal the Texas Dream Act were successful. And even the current Texas
  governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican border hawk, at times equivocated on the
  policy, with his spokesperson saying in 2013 that Abbott believed “the
  objective” of in-state tuition regardless of immigration status was “noble”.
  By 2017, the same year Trump began his first term, polling showed a plurality
  of Texans in support of in-state tuition for undocumented students. More
  recently, research has indicated time and time again that Americans support a
  pathway to legal status for undocumented residents brought to the US as
  children. But arguments against in-state tuition regardless of immigration
  status also grew in popularity: critics contended that the policy is unfair to
  US citizens from other states who have to pay higher rates, or that
  undocumented students are taking spots at competitive schools that could be
  filled by documented Americans. The justice department leaned on similar
  rhetoric in the lawsuit that killed tuition equity in Texas, saying the state
  law is superseded by 1996 federal legislation banning undocumented immigrants
  from getting in-state tuition – over US citizens – based on residency. In
  Texas, the sudden policy change is causing chaos. Even the state’s two largest
  universities, Texas A&amp;M and the University of Texas, are using different
  guidelines to decide which students must pay out-of-state rates.
  “Universities, I think, are the ones that are put in this really difficult
  position,” said Luis Figueroa, senior director of legislative affairs at the
  advocacy group Every Texan. “They are not immigration experts. They’ve
  received very little guidance about how to interpret the consent decree.”
  Meanwhile, young scholars are facing difficult choices. One student, who asked
  to remain anonymous because of her undocumented immigration status, wondered
  about her future. The young woman, who has lived in San Antonio since she was
  nine months old, had enrolled in six courses for the fall at Texas A&amp;M-San
  Antonio and wasn’t sure whether to drop them. It would be her final semester
  before earning her psychology and sociology degrees, but she couldn’t fathom
  paying for out-of-state tuition. “I’m in the unknown,” she said, like “many
  students in this moment.” This story was originally produced by the Hechinger
  Report, a non-profit, independent news organization focused on inequality and
  innovation in education
