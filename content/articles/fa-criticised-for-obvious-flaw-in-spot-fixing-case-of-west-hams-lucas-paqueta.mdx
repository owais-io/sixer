  The Football Association has been strongly criticised by the regulatory
  commission that cleared Lucas Paquetá of spot-fixing charges over its failure
  to provide an independent assessment of the betting data on the West Ham
  player receiving yellow cards. A 314-page report by the commission that heard
  Paquetá’s case was published on Wednesday and makes damning reading for the
  FA, with its evidence criticised for containing “an obvious flaw, namely the
  lack of an independent assessment of the data”. Nick De Marco KC, who
  represented Paquetá, wrote on X that the report was “understood to be the
  longest sports-related judgment ever issued in the world, a reflection of how
  serious the case was, and the amount of evidence deployed in the biggest case
  in the FA’s history”. The FA charged Paquetá with four counts of spot-fixing
  in May 2024 after a 10-month investigation into bookings he received in four
  Premier League matches. Its case centred on connections between the Brazilian
  and 27 of the 253 individuals who placed apparently suspicious bets on him to
  be booked in one or more of the four games, with combined bets of £47,000
  bringing a profit of £167,000. The commission concluded there was no evidence
  of corruption and that the unusual betting patterns were more likely explained
  by the “rather random passing of ‘hot tips’ or perceived ‘inside information’
  within Brazil than a spot-fix”. The three-person panel accepted Paquetá’s
  testimony that there was frequently talk of betting, including on the player
  himself, among his family and friends, and that it would defy logic for
  individuals involved in a spot-fix to be so “loose” with relevant information
  and tips. It also noted that the FA failed to find any mention of the case or
  any discussion of betting on two mobile phones belonging to Paquetá which it
  seized as evidence. The commission’s report is particularly damning of the FA
  betting integrity investigator, Tom Astley, who was also the governing body’s
  chief witness. The failure to produce an independent assessment of the betting
  data is described as “surprising” and the commission noted that the FA
  appeared to contradict the statements of its main witness. The FA’s main
  prosecutor, Jonathan Laidlaw KC, disagreed with Astley’s description of the
  betting patterns as “highly orchestrated”, a difference of interpretation the
  commission concluded was concerning. “The clear appearance given to the
  commission was that the FA was not altogether certain what case it was
  presenting against the player,” it said. The commission reviewed bet-by-bet
  data for 33 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of a spot-fix. The
  report notes that the bettors did not place the maximum stake permitted, which
  would be expected if there were a spot-fix, and the fluctuating number of bets
  on each of the four matches was also interpreted as the bettors acting on tips
  rather than attempting a fix. Paquetá’s on-field performance was also analysed
  by the commission, with his former manager at West Ham, David Moyes, and the
  former referee Mark Clattenburg giving evidence on his behalf. Clattenburg
  described Paquetá’s on-field actions during the four matches as “entirely
  within the normal range of actions for this player”, and the defence team also
  produced evidence showing that the rate at which he received yellow cards
  remained consistent before, during and after the games in question, which took
  place in the 2022-23 season and at the start of the 2023-24 campaign. The
  commission also questioned the independence of the FA’s expert witness on
  performance, Jack Johnson of Stats Perform Integrity Services, because it has
  a commercial relationship with the governing body. Johnson was accused of
  “confirmation bias” for failing to consider Paquetá’s conduct in isolation
  from what he had been told about suspicious betting. As reported by the
  Guardian on Tuesday, Paquetá is facing a separate sanctions hearing after
  being found guilty of two lesser charges of failing to fully cooperate with
  the FA’s investigation. The commission’s report reveals that Paquetá
  subsequently offered to answer any questions from the FA, only for it to
  decline to ask any. “The commission wishes to record its surprise that at the
  investigation stage of what were clearly serious matters … the FA were
  apparently not interested in what the player had to say, notwithstanding his
  stance, taken on advice, in the first interview,” the report says. Paquetá
  gave evidence at the hearing. The FA has no plans to appeal. “The FA is
  committed to ensuring that the integrity of football is maintained, and full
  and thorough investigations will always be conducted into serious allegations
  of rule breaches,” it said in a statement. Alastair Campbell, a partner at the
  law firm Level and the head of Paquetá’s legal team, said on Wednesday: “The
  evidence not only showed he has no interest in gambling whatsoever, but
  confirmed that his integrity as both a player and a person is beyond doubt …
  We are still making submissions in relation to the non-cooperation charge. But
  in a case where his entire career was at risk, Lucas is unquestionably the
  successful party.”
