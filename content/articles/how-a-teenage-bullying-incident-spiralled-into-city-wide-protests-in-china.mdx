  It started as an unpleasant, although not uncommon, teenage bullying incident.
  On 2 August, a video appeared online, showing a group of teenage girls
  kicking, slapping and mocking another girl, later revealed to be aged 14, in
  an abandoned building in Jiangyou, a small city of 730,000 in south-west
  China. According to the local police, the attack, which took place on 22 July,
  resulted in minor injuries to the girl’s scalp and knees. The video went viral
  in the local community, and soon morphed into a large-scale protest that
  overwhelmed the streets of Jiangyou, featuring violent clashes with the police
  and a concerted effort by the authorities to stop news of the event from
  spreading. So what was it about this incident that prompted hundreds, perhaps
  even 1,000, people to gather in the streets of Jiangyou on Monday evening? The
  answer may lie in a potent mixture of years of frustration at how bullying
  cases are handled in China, a lack of trust in local authorities, and the
  sometimes brutal police tactics used to suppress dissent and criticism. One
  video from the scene of the protest, verified by the Guardian, is
  illustrative. People can be heard chanting: “Give us back democracy, reject
  bullying, serve the people.” They also sing the Chinese national anthem. Kevin
  Slaten, who runs China Dissent Monitor, a project tracking unrest in China,
  said the call for democracy was more likely referring to local handling of the
  incident rather than nationwide regime change. Other footage shows violent
  clashes between police and protesters. In one confrontation, a man stands
  between an elderly woman who is arguing with several police officers. “What
  are you going to do? Are you going to drag the old person away?” he shouts.
  Several uniformed police and riot officers then grab him, holding him in a
  headlock, before dragging him away by his arms and legs. Another video shows a
  riot officer hitting someone who is pinned to the ground. The Jiangyou police
  department did not answer the phone when called by the Guardian. ‘People feel
  there’s a lot of injustice’ Early on Monday, the Jiangyou police issued a
  statement saying that three of the alleged bullies, aged 13, 14 and 15, had
  been apprehended, and that the two older girls would be sent to “specialised
  schools for correctional education”. For people in Jiangyou, this was not
  enough to quell the anger. The parents of the victim went to a local
  government office, kowtowing at the feet of a local official, and begged for
  justice. Already, there was a crowd of onlookers. More people soon gathered in
  the conference hall of the Jiangyou city government building to vent their
  frustration at what was perceived as an unduly lenient punishment. By Monday
  evening, the anger had swelled. Hundreds of people took to the streets outside
  the government building. Police barricades were erected along the streets. One
  person who works in a business near the scene of the protest estimated that
  about 1,000 people turned up. One eye-witness told the Guardian that they saw
  at least eight people being arrested, and that the situation escalated when
  the police barricades were removed at about 11.30pm on Monday. The witness
  said the protests got heated because of a feeling that the punishment was too
  light and rumours that one of the bullies had been seen playing billiards
  rather than being in the correctional centre. “This sparked anger among the
  crowd, who gathered to demand an explanation,” the witness said, adding that
  they had seen the police using batons. “Now people will definitely hate
  violent law enforcement,” they said. School bullying is a heated topic in
  China, with many feeling that not enough is done to protect students. In 2023,
  thousands of people protested in Henan after the death of a 14-year-old. The
  boy’s school said the cause of death was suicide, but his parents and local
  citizens suspected foul play In Jiangyou, the scale of the anger may also
  reflect a more generalised distrust of the authorities, said Slaten. There is
  a “lack of trust at the local level in the way that these cases are handled,”
  Slaten said. “People feel there’s a lot of injustice. They feel indignation
  about the way that authorities, in this case the school and the police, were
  handling this case. “And the authorities, as people start to push for handling
  it differently, and these protests get more intense, they start cracking down
  on the protesters, and that only makes them more indignant about the response
  of the government.” Slaten said the cycle of a protest about a specific
  grievance spiralling into a wider action against local authorities was
  “something that is seen quite often” in China. Censors move in By Tuesday
  morning, the authorities turned their attention towards controlling the
  narrative. The hashtag for “Jiangyou” briefly topped Weibo’s trending topics
  chart, according to China Digital Times, a website that tracks the Chinese
  internet. But comments and videos were soon censored, while posts promoting
  the official version of events flooded social media searches. On Tuesday,
  Chinese media reported that two adults surnamed Ding and Yang had been
  punished by the public security authorities for “fabricating rumours to
  attract attention” about the incident. The crackdown on people talking about
  the incident was also enforced offline. One woman who works in a shop near the
  local government building told the Guardian that she was not allowed to talk
  about the incident because “the police have already given us a verbal
  warning”. Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian Yang
