  Extremely hot days in summer are becoming more normal across the globe, but in
  the UK and other typically mild countries, our homes are not prepared. A third
  of UK homes are susceptible to overheating, and research shows that renters,
  people with young children and those from ethnic minorities are at particular
  risk of living in dangerously hot homes in England. So what can be done to
  cool down homes? End the urban heat island effect Cities are generally much
  less well-equipped for heat than areas with smaller populations. Hot days can
  be unbearable in those that have not been adapted to a heating climate. Many
  cities are built with dark surfaces – think asphalt, bricks and concrete –
  which absorb sunlight during the day and then release it slowly at night. This
  creates scorching areas in the daytime and stops the city cooling in the
  evening, keeping everyone overly hot. Cities including Athens, Algiers and
  Barcelona have been experimenting with high solar reflective surfaces, which
  bounce back sunlight instead of absorbing it. Think Mediterranean Picture a
  flat in London and it’s unlikely you’ll think of a home in a shady square with
  shutters and a balcony, painted in a pale colour. This sounds more like a
  Mediterranean apartment a Londoner may visit in the summer. But shutters block
  the sun’s rays and create shade in the home. In countries that have
  traditionally had hotter summers, people know it’s important to keep sunshine
  out of the home to cool it down. Government figures show that almost 91% of
  households in England throw open windows to cool down the house, while just
  under 11% of us, rising to 16% in London, use shutters. Opening windows at
  night, once the outside air has cooled, can help to cool down a home. About
  70% of households in the north of England say they always do this, compared
  with 63% in London, which takes longer to cool down. Reflective paint on roofs
  and outdoor surfaces are also key, as is the design of the home, which should
  allow ventilation and airflow to cool rooms when windows are open. Green up
  the local area Trees near a home help to alleviate that terrible feeling of a
  hot, sticky summer night, which leads to days without adequate rest during a
  heatwave. Studies have found that street trees can keep the area around them
  up to 5C cooler during the evening. The UK Green Building Council advocates a
  3:30:300 approach: you should be able to see three trees from your dwelling;
  you should have 30% tree canopy cover in your neighbourhood; and you should be
  no more than 300 metres from a biodiverse green space or park. Almost half of
  neighbourhoods in English towns and cities have less than 10% tree cover,
  however, and more than a third lack adequate access to green space. Cities
  around the world are trying this. Beijing, for example, is in the process of
  building five ventilation corridors more than 500 metres wide, which will link
  to rivers and green spaces. Use heat pumps for air conditioning, particularly
  in flats Air conditioning hasn’t been necessary in the UK and other mild
  countries, but now hot summer days are becoming the norm, it’s something
  people are thinking about. Only 3.6% of households in England keep cool using
  an air conditioner – ranging from 1.5% in the north-west to 5.7% in London,
  according to English Housing Survey figures. Instead more than half of
  households use mechanical fans, which circulate air and create a cooling
  breeze but don’t lower the temperature of the air. Ministers are now
  considering subsidising the installation of air conditioning in the UK for the
  first time. The boiler upgrade scheme offers households a substantial discount
  on the installation of air-source heat pumps, efficient electrical
  alternatives to gas boilers, in order to cut fossil fuel use and meet net zero
  targets. Until now only standard heat pumps have been eligible for the grants,
  but a form of technology exists that can heat and cool buildings. “Air-to-air”
  heat pumps take in air from outside and pass it through a heat exchanger to
  create hotter or cooler air that is pumped into the home.
