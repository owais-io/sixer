  ‘There’s no work now, just debt’: Cambodian garment workers face precarious
  future as US tariffs loom

  Tens of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers who have fled Thailand since
  border tensions began were already facing an uncertain future. Now, as they
  re-enter a precarious job market braced for US tariffs, they are struggling to
  find work. A 36% export tax imposed on Cambodia by US President Donald Trump
  is due to come into effect on 1 August. Trade talks between the US and
  Cambodia resumed after a ceasefire was agreed with Thailand after five days of
  border fighting, but on the eve of the deadline for setting rates no new deal
  had been agreed. The tariff is likely to put hundreds of thousands of jobs at
  risk, particularly in Cambodia’s garment, footwear and travel goods (GFT)
  sector – an industry that employs a million people, mostly women, according to
  the UN, and underpins the country’s formal economy. “We are talking about a
  substantial loss,” says Massimiliano Tropeano, a garment sector consultant and
  member of EuroCham Cambodia. “Factories supplying American brands will be
  substantially affected, with very little room to absorb the 36% added costs.”
  He believes that up to 150,000 GFT jobs could be lost. Cambodia’s dependence
  on the US market is deep. The US is the largest single-country buyer of GFT
  goods – in 2024, it accounted for more than $5.2bn (£39bn), or 38.5% of
  Cambodia’s GFT total export revenue. Cambodia exported $12.7bn in goods to the
  US, while importing just under $322m – a trade surplus that put it in the
  crosshairs of Trump’s revived tariff campaign. GFT goods made up more than
  half of those exports. Mu Sochua, an exiled Cambodian opposition politician
  and rights activist, says: “About 360,000 manufacturing workers [across all
  sectors] in Cambodia are directly dependent on US demand, many of whom risk
  losing their jobs if the tariffs remain in place.” She adds that with women
  making up more than 75% of the garment sector’s workforce, they will bear the
  brunt – with knock-on effects for entire households. Industry observers warn
  the pressure will be felt most acutely by factory workers already stretched by
  long hours, minimal protections and stagnant pay. Hul Voeung and Touch
  Samnang, a middle-aged Khmer couple who migrated to Thailand before the
  pandemic in search of better pay, recently returned to Cambodia after
  struggling to find jobs last year. Living in a cramped one-room home on the
  edge of the capital, Phnom Penh, the couple are struggling to stay afloat,
  sending most of their earnings to their children, who live with grandparents
  in their home province. Voeung now runs a noodle stand, while Samnang has
  picked up work at a small garment factory. But at over 40, she is not formally
  registered – a tactic used in some subcontractor factories to avoid paying
  worker benefits – and makes the minimum wage of $208 a month working 14-hour
  shifts. “Once the US tariffs are enacted, it’s going to be very difficult for
  us at the factory, because there may be no more work,” she says. “I’ve already
  seen the bigger factories cutting back, closing at 4pm, with no overtime.”
  Nearby competitors such as Vietnam and Indonesia have struck deals for 20% and
  19% tariffs respectively, offering potential reshoring opportunities for
  manufacturers. Their extra advantage, according to Tropeano, lies in homegrown
  mills that reduce reliance on Chinese fabrics – something Cambodia lacks. US
  officials have accused Chinese companies – reported to own as much as 90% of
  Cambodia’s garment factories – of using the country as a trans-shipment hub to
  sidestep existing tariffs. Tropeano believes there is a strong possibility the
  36% tariff will stick, due to Cambodia’s heavy reliance on Chinese suppliers.
  The result, he estimates, could be a 20% drop in exports by next year. A
  report by Better Factories Cambodia in June found that nearly half of 203 GFT
  goods factories surveyed were facing order uncertainty beyond the next three
  months due to the looming tariffs. Fifteen per cent reported no confirmed
  orders, and almost half were unsure of their operational capacity. On the
  factory floor, the pressure is palpable. At Trax Apparel in Phnom Penh, which
  exports 20% of its clothes to the US, Yorn Yeut, a union leader, says workers
  are anxious and echoes Samnang’s point that small or subcontracted factories
  with fewer benefits keep hiring due to fewer overheads, while many larger ones
  have already cut hours. The economic instability is rippling far beyond the
  capital. Even before the latest clashes, migrant workers had begun pouring
  back across the Thai border. About 50,000 Cambodians are reported to have
  returned after the first border clash in May, which set off two months of
  simmering tensions. But the exodus accelerated after shots rang out again on
  24 July, with thousands more seen flooding into border provinces where there
  was no fighting. Twenty-five-year-old That Sopring, says he returned from
  Thailand after the latest bombing, without aid from either government. “No one
  forced me, but I came back with fear,” he says. “There’s no work now, just
  debt.” A construction worker for nearly a decade, Sopring took out loans to
  return and to survive at home. “Even when I worked, I earned 370 baht (£8.50)
  a day, but spent more than half just to live. Now I have nothing coming in.”
  Soy Rachana, 27, faces similar uncertainty. After 10 years as a domestic
  worker in Thailand, she came home to the border Banteay Meanchey province also
  unsupported and unemployed. “I returned after hearing about the border
  fighting and worrying for my child,” she says. “I’ve been back two months, but
  there is no work in the countryside.” It is estimated more than half of
  Cambodian households are in debt to formal lenders, making it one of the most
  credit-penetrated countries in the region. The Cambodian prime minister, Hun
  Manet, has urged banks and microfinance institutions to ease loan repayments
  for returning migrants. His appeal highlights the wider problem of predatory
  lending in the country, which often traps vulnerable workers in cycles of
  debt. “Cambodia’s labour market presents a paradox,” says Tola Mouen,
  executive director of the Center for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights. While
  official figures suggest near-full employment, they mask realities. More than
  14% of workers earn less than $2.15 a day and 53% are working in insecure
  jobs. “Given those figures – and the scale of household debt – I don’t see how
  Cambodia could absorb all the returning migrant workers, or even half of the
  1.2 million in Thailand,” Mouen says. “With so few options at home and no
  protections, workers are more likely to return to Thailand, even with tensions
  running high, than to stay and face poverty here.” For now, Cambodia must try
  to hold the ceasefire at the border and strike a last-minute trade deal or
  face the impact of US tariffs. Much now hinges on the whims of US trade policy
  – but with Trump insisting the 1 August deadline will not be extended, hopes
  that a war-scarred region might be granted reprieve are slim. Additional
