  Donald Trump on Monday announced that lawyers are drafting an executive order
  to eliminate mail-in voting, days after Vladimir Putin told him US elections
  were rigged because of postal ballots. In a White House meeting alongside
  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump said: “We’re going to start
  with an executive order that’s being written right now by the best lawyers in
  the country to end mail in ballots because they’re corrupt.” The push follows
  Trump’s meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday, when the Russian president
  allegedly told him that the 2020 election “was rigged because you have mail-in
  voting”, according to Trump’s subsequent interview with Sean Hannity. Trump
  falsely claimed that late former president Jimmy Carter opposed mail-in
  voting, saying: “Even Jimmy Carter with this commission, they set it up. He
  said, the one thing about mail in voting, you will never have an honest
  election if you have mail in it.” In reality, Carter urged the opposite during
  the 2020 Covid pandemic, with the Carter Center arguing that the best way to
  tackle potential voter fraud in a vote-by-mail situation is to strengthen
  safeguards and expand voting access. “I urge political leaders across the
  country to take immediate steps to expand vote-by-mail and other measures that
  can help protect the core of American democracy – the right of our citizens to
  vote,” Carter said in a statement. Trump started off his Monday morning by
  making a lengthy Truth Social post, in which he said: “I am going to lead a
  movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS,” while also targeting “Highly
  ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES”
  which he claimed cost “Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated
  Watermark Paper”. In that post, Trump falsely asserted that the US was “now
  the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting” and claimed “All
  others gave it up because of the MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD ENCOUNTERED.” Data from
  International Idea contradicts this claim, showing that 34 countries worldwide
  allow mail-in voting, with 12 allowing it for all voters and 22 for some
  voters. Most European countries offer some form of mail voting, and more than
  100 countries let their citizens vote by mail when living abroad. US courts
  rejected numerous fraud allegations after the 2020 presidential election,
  finding no evidence of widespread irregularities. Across the US, 28 states let
  voters request a mail ballot without giving a reason, according to the
  National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight states and Washington DC send
  everyone their ballot in the mail automatically, and about one in five
  American voters lives in one of those states. The president’s opposition to
  mail-in voting comes despite his own use of the method. In 2020, both Trump
  and the first lady, Melania Trump, submitted vote-by-mail ballots in Florida
  ahead of the state’s primaries, which Palm Beach county confirmed receiving.
  Trump also claimed states are “merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government”
  and must follow presidential orders on elections. That’s wrong: the
  constitution gives states control over how they conduct elections. Mail voting
  has exploded in popularity – from fewer than one in 10 voters in 1996 to
  nearly half during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. As of 2022, it was used by
  about one in three voters, according to a report by the MIT Election Data and
  Science Lab. Supporters have long said mail ballots make voting easier for
  people who can’t get to polling stations – those with disabilities, parents
  with young kids, or workers with long shifts, while also giving voters more
  time to research candidates at home.
