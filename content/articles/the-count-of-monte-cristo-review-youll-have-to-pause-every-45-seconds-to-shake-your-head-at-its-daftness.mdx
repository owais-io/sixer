  Are you ready for some bad, fun TV made from a bad, fun book? Of course you
  are! It’s high summer and the air is heavy with promise, so come inside, get
  comfy on the sofa and prepare to binge an eight-episode adaptation of
  Alexandre Dumas’ ludicrous potboiler The Count of Monte Cristo. This series
  from Greg Latter and Sandro Petraglia stars Sam Claflin (last seen on the
  small screen being very good as the main man of the sextet in Daisy Jones and
  the Six) as one of the most wronged men in history, Edmond Dantès. Gosh, he
  goes through the mill. As do we. The two episodes available for review (there
  was a third, but the site kept crashing – possibly for my own protection) are
  extraordinary. The plot is simple enough. Wild, of course – that is what keeps
  you turning the 1,300 or so pages of the book – but straightforward once you
  realise that la credibilité is not an overarching concern. We are in France in
  1815, just as Napoleon is escaping Elba and looking forward to his brief
  return to power. Meanwhile, our man Dantès annoys a fellow sailor, Danglars
  (Blake Ritson), by being promoted to captain over him. I suspect a lifetime of
  jokes about his name have rendered Danglars overly touchy, but it proves to be
  very bad luck for our hero. Because Dantès also narks a man called Fernand
  Mondego (Harry Taurasi) by sweeping his cousin Mercédès (Ana Girardot) off her
  feet when Fernand was quite looking forward to doing so himself. Danglars and
  Fernand duly get together to frame Dantès for treason. Thanks to the
  self-interest and corruption of Marseille’s deputy prosecutor, Gérard de
  Villefort (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard), they succeed. Before you can say: “What a
  trio of dirty dogs!” Dantès is chucked into a carriage and then into a cell on
  an island fortress, where he moulders away for 10 years with nothing but the
  maggots in his gruel for company. The crushing despair a man would feel,
  pushing him to the brink of madness and beyond is conveyed by putting Claflin
  in a terrible long wig. But then! He hears a tapping from the other side of
  his cell wall. It is the sound of Abbé Faria, played by Jeremy Irons, breaking
  through. The abbot shares his education and escape plan with his new best mate
  and they spend the next five years chipping away at the stones and mortar
  lying between them and freedom. Faria also works out just what dirty doggery
  has taken place and gives Dantès a raging thirst for vengeance, albeit one
  that he cannot slake until he is out of Chateau Maggotes. Alas, just as they
  are about to flee, the abbot has a stroke, leaving him with the strength only
  to give a 40-minute monologue about the origins and meaning of a scrap of
  parchment in his ragged pocket. It shows the location of treasure buried on
  the island of Monte Cristo; he bequeaths it to Dantès before carking it.
  Dantès puts the corpse in his own bed, sews himself into Faria’s body bag and
  gets himself thrown off the battlements and into the sea. Liberté! There are
  two problems. Un, we are but a quarter of the way through this and we still
  have so much to cover – finding the treasure, becoming the count, fooling
  Parisian high society, some murders, some currency manipulations, at least one
  duel, some poisoning, blackmail, embezzlement and assorted other shenanigans.
  I fear that either the story must have been slashed to ribbons or that we will
  have to hurtle through at such a speed that it becomes incomprehensible.
  Incoherence already threatens, because of problème deux: the script. The Count
  of Monte Cristo requires you to pause it every 45 seconds or so to shake your
  head at needless utterances such as: “If we can’t get through this storm,
  we’ll perish.” Some of it is truly unbelievable. Did Dantès really just say:
  ‘I’d like to add two hours a day to my digging,’ to his abbot friend? Did the
  abbot honestly ask, in wonderment at the sight of a watch Mercédès had given
  Dantès: “And you’ve kept it all this time?” Yes, of course! What was he going
  to do? Lose it somewhere in his teeny tiny cell? Give it to a mouse? Chuck it
  out the window in a sudden passion for minimalism? (A high proportion of the
  performances are terrible, too, but let’s be kind and blame most of that on
  the instructions the actors have been given.) There are enough of these
  howling absurdities to hobble the pacing, which needs to be fast and furious
  to cover Dumas’ own, and to prevent the viewer from making any investment in
  the characters. But their stupidity brings a joy of its own. When the tech
  gremlins decide I am ready, I look forward to many more episodes. • The Count
