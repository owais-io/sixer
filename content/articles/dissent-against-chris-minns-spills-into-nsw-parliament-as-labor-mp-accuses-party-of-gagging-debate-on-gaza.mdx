  Simmering tensions within New South Wales Labor over the premier’s handling of
  last weekend’s protest against the killing in Gaza have erupted into the
  public domain, with a member of the left faction delivering a fiery speech in
  parliament, accusing his own party of trying to shut down debate on the Middle
  East. Anthony D’Adam, a former trade unionist, convener of Labor Friends of
  Palestine and a member of the upper house, used an adjournment debate on
  Thursday night to accuse Chris Minns and the caucus of “stultifying the
  internal culture of the party”. D’Adam said MPs’ fear of losing their seats
  was behind a “risk-averse culture” in NSW Labor. Earlier this week, a number
  of backbenchers tried to raise their concerns in caucus about Minns’s position
  on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and his decision to oppose the weekend
  protest across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which was attended by up to 300,000
  people in pouring rain. Sign up: AU Breaking News email D’Adam said in his
  speech on Thursday that he was gagged and then bullied by caucus members. He
  now faces potential disciplinary action or possibly even expulsion from the
  Labor party for publicly airing matters discussed in caucus. In May last year,
  Minns sacked D’Adam from his role as parliamentary secretary for youth
  justice, after he criticised the actions of state police officers towards
  pro-Palestinian protesters. At the time, Minns called D’Adam’s comments
  “absolutely reprehensible”. Speaking out publicly about caucus meetings and
  criticising the leader is extremely rare in Labor. “Earlier this week in the
  Labor caucus, I sought to make pointed criticisms of the premier in respect to
  the issues of Palestine and protest,” D’Adam told parliament. “In the meeting,
  I was howled down, abused [and] told I should resign from the Labor party. A
  motion was moved to gag me from speaking. In my entire time in the parliament,
  I have never witnessed such an event. “No apology has been received for the
  bullying behaviour I was forced to endure. It is deeply disturbing that the
  caucus appears incapable of entertaining dissenting views and took the step
  that it did.” D’Adam said the response “can only confirm in the minds of
  caucus members that it is best to keep quiet”. He denied making a personal
  attack on Minns. “My critique of the premier was a political critique,” he
  said. “It was a critique of the government. It was not a personal attack on
  the premier as an individual but a criticism of his handling of a number of
  matters relating to the issues of the day.” D’Adam said that during the caucus
  debate, which Guardian Australia reported on Monday, he could “see the fear in
  the faces and hear it in the voices of my colleagues”. “They were concerned
  that this type of conflict could cost them their seats or their ministries,”
  he said. “It is this fear that is driving a risk-averse culture in our party.
  But the challenges that we face as a society require bold government. “The
  solutions we require are full of political risk, the problems like war,
  climate catastrophe, dislocating technological change and the growing gulf of
  inequality are not going to be solved by whispered conversations in quiet
  corners of government. We have to be able to debate our differences.” The
  premier said on Friday that Tuesday’s caucus discussion was wrapped up because
  question time was about to start. He said he wouldn’t have characterised the
  treatment of D’Adam as bullying but said there had been “robust debate”. “It
  was a long debate. Generally, the history of the Labor party shows we are
  better for it,” Minns said. In his first two years as leader, Minns has run a
  tight ship with few internal problems within the party. But the conflict in
  Gaza and Minns’s move to pass laws curtailing protests have brought criticism
  from human rights groups and within his own party. D’Adam told parliament that
  internal debate within Labor was crucial to “recognise mistakes when they are
  made and provide a pathway for renewal and new directions”. “But my experience
  has been that the party is increasingly centralised and authoritarian in its
  disposition.”
