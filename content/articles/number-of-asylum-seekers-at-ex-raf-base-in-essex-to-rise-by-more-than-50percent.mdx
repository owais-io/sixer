  The Home Office is increasing the number of asylum seekers accommodated at a
  controversial military base by more than 50%. There are about 800 asylum
  seekers housed at the remote former RAF base MDP Wethersfield in Essex and the
  Home Office is moving in 445 more. Wethersfield is one of only two Home Office
  mass accommodation sites, along with Napier barracks in Folkestone, and was
  already the largest. Campaigners and the local council have expressed concern
  about the increase at the remote site, scene of previous anti-migrant
  protests. NGOs are concerned that asylum seekers en route to Wethersfield
  could be targeted by anti-migrant demonstrators on their way to protest
  outside the Bell hotel in Epping if their routes cross. An internal Home
  Office update on the situation at Wethersfield dated 24 July, seen by the
  Guardian, states: “While the site’s regular cap is 800 an additional 445 bed
  spaces may be used temporarily during peak demand. There are no plans to
  exceed 1,245.” Charities and watchdogs have criticised conditions on the site.
  The former independent chief inspector of borders and immigration David Neal
  described “an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness” among the asylum seekers
  there when he inspected the site. Home Office sources said the increase in
  numbers was a temporary measure and that all relevant health and safety rules
  would be complied with. The population of the nearby village of the same name
  was recorded in the most recent census as 1,298. Although some local residents
  have expressed opposition to having asylum seekers on the base, many have said
  they are supportive of the asylum seekers themselves and are involved with
  initiatives to provide hands on support for them during their time at
  Wethersfield. “Things are pretty quiet,” said one resident. “We haven’t had
  much trouble here.” In March, a high court judge found the former home
  secretary Suella Braverman acted unlawfully in accommodating three asylum
  seekers at the former RAF base. The men – who were at Wethersfield between
  July 2023 and February 2024 – argued they were living in prison-like
  conditions. Responding to the planned increase in numbers at Wethersfield,
  Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said: “Given the anxiety and
  despair this former military camp has inflicted on its residents, the
  government should be shutting it down not expanding its capacity. “That’s what
  Keir Starmer promised in opposition, and that was before the high court ruled
  that survivors of torture and modern slavery had been unlawfully accommodated
  at the camp. It is deeply worrying that the opposite is now happening, with
  hundreds more set to the subjected to this prison-like camp.” Graham Butland,
  the leader of Braintree district council, said: “This disused airbase in a
  very rural area does not have the infrastructure to host asylum seekers on
  such a large scale.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “All use of property or
  sites under our ownership is carried out in accordance with relevant planning
  permissions, and we work together with local authorities and other
  stakeholders to ensure the accommodation estate is continuously reviewed and
  managed safely and effectively at all times.”
