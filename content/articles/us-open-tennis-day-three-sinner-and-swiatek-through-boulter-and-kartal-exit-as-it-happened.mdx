  That’ll be all from me today. There have been dominant wins for Sinner and
  Swiatek, but Auger-Aliassime v Harris brought plenty of thrills, the scoreline
  barely revealing the truth. We’ll obviously be back again tomorrow, when the
  second round gets going. Cheers! Auger-Aliassime is up 30-0 but Harris just
  refuses to lie down, levelling up. A forehand into the corner sets
  Auger-Aliassime up for match point, though. Harris takes it to deuce but
  Auger-Aliassime sends down an ace and has his victory shortly after. It’s
  straight sets but it was not straightforward. Terrific from Auger-Aliassime,
  shuffling back to nail an overhead smash and make it 30-all on Harris’ serve.
  Harris – a Nottingham Forest fan (the ATP bio page is a fun read) – is forced
  to deuce. A wide serve forces Auger-Aliassime to go long but he responds with
  a passing forehand. Deuce once again … and Auger-Aliassime triumphs in a
  lengthy rally, both players giving everything now. A chance to break: and it’s
  a double fault! Auger-Aliassime leads 6-4, 7-6 (8), 5-4. With nearly two hours
  and 50 minutes on the board, he’ll serve for the match. Auger-Aliassime is
  properly made to work for it as he holds his serve to take it to 4-4. It
  sounds like a decent atmosphere over on Stadium 17, every point getting plenty
  of love and appreciation. He leads 6-4, 7-6 (8), 4-4. Billy Harris halts
  Auger-Aliassime’s march and has two break points … but two solid first serves
  lead to deuce. A whopping cross-court forehand gives Harris advantage – amd he
  takes it, forcing Auger-Aliassime wide to set up the volley at the net. It’s
  3-3 in the third set. Sorry for the last post, Billy. Auger-Aliassime is going
  in for the kill now, dropping low to complete a gorgeous forehand volley – he
  has three set points. He needs just one to go up 3-2 in the third set against
  Harris. Harris, now properly up against it, has some trouble to contend with
  as he trails 0-30, 1-1 in the third set. But he’s still fighting, managing to
  hold his serve. Over on Court 7, Stefanos Tsitsipas lost the first set against
  Alexandre Muller 6-4. But the 26th seed, a two-time slam runner-up, has
  recovered to go up 3-0 in the second. Tumaini Carayol provides the write-up on
  Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter’s defeats. Kartal confirms that it was cramp
  that got to her in the final set. “Where wasn’t I feeling it? We had calves,
  we had quads, we had hamstrings, and we had the fingers [clamped down] on the
  tennis racket.” But it’s Harris who has set point once again … and he’s
  annoyed as he goes a touch long. Harris makes an approach to the net to set up
  his third set point … with Auger-Aliassime to serve. A 122mph serve produces a
  long return from Harris. Now it’s set point for Auger-Aliassime after Harris
  nets a backhand. Harris overhits his forehand and Auger-Aliassime is one
  pumped up and relieved man. He has, somehow, nabbed this set. Auger-Aliassime
  leads 6-4, 7-6 (8). Auger-Aliassime and Harris are 5-5 in their second set
  tie-break … and it’s Harris who gets to set point first, Auger-Aliassime going
  long with a backhand. Auger-Aliassime to serve … and he keeps himself in the
  set with a delicious, whippy forehand to kiss the line. 6-6 in the tie-break …
  Lys triumphs in the end, but Jones fought back well after a miserable first
  set. How about that? Auger-Aliassime goes 2-0 up in the tie-break with a
  forehand pass from behind the baseline to end a 32-shot rally! Auger-Aliassime
  jumps into a backhand winner to make it 30-all and he gets himself to set
  point … but Harris finds a sharp serve to get to deuce, and he resists to
  force a second set tie-break. Auger-Aliassime holds to 15 and Harris must now
  serve to stay in the set. It’s time for the former world No 6 to really step
  up and deny Harris a tie-break. Right then, Harris is up 5-4 and serving for
  the second set. He’s up 15-0 after Auger-Aliassime goes long with a backhand
  return. A backhand into the net levels Auger-Aliassime up … and out comes
  another unforced error, a misplaced slice. It’s 15-30 and this is an opening
  for Auger-Aliassime, up against a man on debut in the main draw of the US
  Open. And here it is: Auger-Aliassime advances to the net and sets up two
  break points. The Canadian converts to level the second set at 5-5. Jones is
  fighting on against Lys, breaking her opponent’s serve again to go 2-1 up in
  the second set. She’s struggling on her serve though and loses her grip of the
  racket after a forehand to trail 15-30. A long forehand gives Lys two break
  points, and she takes the second. Lys leads 6-0, 2-2. Harris leads 3-2 and is
  quickly up to 30-0 on his serve, with Auger-Aliassime netting an attempted
  drop shot. After Auger-Aliassime levels up, Harris catches him off guard with
  a shot down the middle, prompting an awkward and long backhand from the
  Canadian. Harris takes a 4-2 lead in the second set. Jones is on the board and
  with a break, too. A fine backhand to the corner sets her up for a forehand
  smash – she leads 15-0 on her serve. A backhand winner down the line from Lys
  in response is so good that Jones has to applaud it. Another down-the-line
  backhand makes it 15-30, and Lys marches on to break back and level up. Lys
  leads 6-0, 1-1. Billy Harris is storming back! I left him for a couple minutes
  and and he’s suddenly up 2-0 in the second set after a love hold. Francesca
  Jones is having a pretty tough time. She’s serving while down 0-5, and Lys has
  set point … she wins it as Jones nets a forehand. Jones celebrated reaching
  the top 100 for the first time last month but is feeling the brutality of the
  highest level here. Harris overdoes it with a drop shot and Auger-Aliassime
  capitalises – set point. He converts it, too, with Harris landing a forehand
  well wide. Auger-Aliassime takes the first set 6-4. Harris has a chance to
  break against Auger-Aliassime but the 25th seed manages to hold, the game
  sealed with a deft volley, his lead 5-4. There’s not a great deal separating
  these two at the moment – they’re level on winners and not far off in terms of
  unforced errors. Francesca Jones is down a break against Eva Lys, who has
  produced career-best runs in the other three slams this year, her best effort
  a fourth-round finish in Australia. Lys leads 3-0 in the first set.
  Auger-Aliassime holds to love before Harris goes up 30-0 after a 15-shot
  rally, and Auger-Aliassime fires wide with a forehand return. It’s another
  love hold, taking the first set to 4-4. Harris breaks Auger-Aliassime thanks
  to a double fault, with the Canadian leading 3-2. Harris’ confidence grows as
  he races to a 40-0 lead, and a deep forehand forces a long backhand from
  Auger-Aliassime. 3-3, and the seeded player is feeling some heat. Harris is
  forced to deuce but is finally on the board as Auger-Aliassime leads 3-1.
  There’s another Brit in action on Court 6, with qualifier Francesca Jones
  meeting Eva Lys. Hello again, friends. There’s British representation over on
  Stadium 17, with Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime taking on Billy Harris, a
  lucky loser. The 30-year-old enjoyed the best slam display of his career when
  he made it to the second round of Wimbledon this year. Auger-Aliassime, the
  25th seed, has moved to a 3-0 lead in the first set. That’s all from me – Taha
  is back! Good night. Job done for the No 8 seed. “It felt great - first
  matches are not easy to get used to the rhythm,” Iga Swiatek said after
  thrashing Emiliana Arango 6-1, 6-2 in the first round earlier. “It was a solid
  match. I am happy I wasn’t trying to overpower.” Is she happy to see all the
  Polish fans? “Polish fans are kind of everywhere. It’s super-nice to feel the
  support always … it’s great. But I also appreciate people who come from
  different countries.” Swiatek lost During the typically chaotic media day
  before Wimbledon in June, Jannik Sinner and Jack Draper were working through
  their commitments when they briefly crossed paths in the broadcast media mixed
  zone. As they warmly greeted each other, Sinner looked his good friend up and
  down, and a smile spread across his face: “Always stronger,” he said, jokingly
  flexing both arms. Draper, who responded with a sheepish, embarrassed laugh,
  has heard such observations many times in recent months. At the same time that
  he has risen up the rankings over the past 15 months, transforming himself
  into one of the best in the world, he has become one of the most physically
  strong players on the ATP Tour. Maya Joint’s extraordinary 2025 success story
  has begun its latest chapter on another positive note with the fearless
  Australian youngster successfully negotiating her opening US Open clash at
  Flushing Meadows. What do you think of Alcaraz’s new barnet? It’ll grow back.
  In the women’s singles, the seeded players yet to take to the court are as
  follows: Ashlyn Krueger v Sofia Kenin (26) Laura Siegemund v Diana Shnaider
  (20) Ekaterina Alexandrova (13) v Anastasija Sevastova What’s coming up in the
  men’s and women’s singles? Good question. Felix Auger Aliassime is up against
  Billy Harris on Court 17 imminently. Alex de Minaur (8) is facing his
  Australian Chris O’Connell a bit later, and Stefanos Tsitsipas (26) v
  Alexandre Müller will be lighting up Court 7. “It feels great to be back here,
  it’s a very special tournament, the last grand slam of the year, the
  atmosphere is always amazing, thanks to everyone for coming, for cheering and
  supporting,” says Sinner. “I’m feeling healthy again [after illness in
  Cincinatti] … we did our best to be in the best possible shape … let’s see
  what’s coming. “Amazing memories,” he says of winning last year. “A lot of
  emotions coming back to this grand slam. [But] Every day is different.” 'I’m
  very happy to be back here.” Sinner was “under absolutely no pressure
  whatsoever” observes one of the commentators. “One way traffic from start to
  finish,” chips in Tim Henman. “Sinner looking so comfortable, so confident.”
  Les jeux sont faits. Fun fact: In 2021, Kopriva beat Denis Shapovalov in the
  second round at the Swiss Open. That is his one win against a top-10 player.
  Kopriva lost 6-1 6-2 6-2 to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last year. Sinner 6-1,
  6-1, 5-2 *Kopriva (*denotes next server) A glimmer for Kopriva at 0-30. Sinner
  wins an imperious point next up, and it looks like the danger will soon be
  over, but then Kopriva wins a long rally thanks to a drop shot and a handsome
  cross-court winner with Sinner coming to the net. Two break points, but very
  quickly it’s back to deuce, and the Italian wastes one advantage, but makes no
  such mistake next up. This really is some of the lowest-key tennis I’ve seen
  in a long time, based on how much bother Kopriva is causing Sinner, ie zero.
  *Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 4-2 Kopriva (*denotes next server) A precious hold for
  Kopriva. Are you watching/reading? Mail me. Francisco Cerundolo, the No 19
  seed, leads Matteo Arnaldi 3-1 in their fifth and deciding set over on Court
  7. Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 4-1 *Kopriva (*denotes next server) Kopriva seems to be
  mishitting everything. Seems like a case of stagefright, or is there some
  other bizarre, unknown reason behind this meltdown? *Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 3-1
  Kopriva (*denotes next server) At 15-30, Kopriva miscues horribly with a
  regulation stroke from the back of the court and it’s two break points for
  Sinner. Then he double faults, handing his illustrious opponent a very easy
  game. Sinner isn’t having to do much here, and he should be safely through
  shortly. I can’t even tell you the fun fact about Kopriva hailing from the
  same Czech town as Petra Kvitova, as I see Taha already mentioned it. Sinner
  6-1, 6-1, 2-1 *Kopriva (*denotes next server) A regulation hold for Sinner, to
  -15, and it remains on serve in the third set. Jack Draper is now pictured,
  having a hit on one of the back courts, following his win yesterday against
  the big-hitting Federico Agustín Gómez. Draper faces Zizou Bergs, the world No
  48, of Belgium in the second round on Thursday. Thanks Taha. Hi all. Kopriva
  holds, and it’s 1-1 in the third set. Luke McLaughlin is going to step in
  while I steal a break. Keep him company. Amanda Anisimova is seeded eighth and
  up against Australia’s Kimberly Birrell. They’re 1-1 in the opening set,
  Anisimova looking to build on her run to the final of Wimbledon. That last
  match in south London was a brutal experience but this is her home slam … and,
  well, look at that – she races through a hold to lead 2-1. Sinner skips to the
  net, dictating the point to leave Kopriva stretching for a forehand and on the
  floor. The No 1 has two set points, and Kopriva provides a double fault.
  Sinner leads 6-1, 6-1 with just over an hour on the board. Kopriva hails from
  Fulnek in the Czech Republic and grew up in the same area as Petra Kvitova,
  who bowed out of the professional game yesterday. Sinner isn’t bothered about
  the backstory, though; relentless, he breaks once again and leads 4-1 in the
  second set. Sinner is already up a break in the second set but Kopriva
  delivers a love hold, closed out with successive aces. The Italian leads 6-1,
  2-1. Lorenzo Musetti, the 10th seed, has wrapped up a four-set victory over
  Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. The Italian, a semi-finalist at Roland Garros this
  year, triumphs 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. Kopriva finally has some joy, claiming
  his first game to trail 1-5. Sinner responds with an ace and domination at the
  net. Kopriva closes a 15-shot rally with a lovely drop shot and saves three
  set points! Sinner spanks a 127mph ace and Kopriva goes long to extinguish the
  prospect of any jeopardy. Sinner takes the first set 6-1. Tidy work. OK, time
  to get to the world No 1. Jannik Sinner is going OK. He’s 5-0 up against Vit
  Kopriva after just 20 minutes. Decent. Haddad Maia resorts to an underarm
  serve and Kartal, after saving two match points, has a chance to break! The
  Brazilian saves it before setting up her third match point … she advances to
  the net for one last push and it works. Kartal nets and this incredible slog
  is over. Two players, struggling to move by the end, have put on a serious
  show. Kartal tries to torture Haddad Maia with a drop shot but the 18th seed
  gets to it and wins the net battle. Haddad Maia wins another point at the net
  and she signals her joy to the crowd. A wide forehand from Kartal hands Haddad
  Maia two break points … but Kartal finds a lift of energy when it matters. She
  crouches down in pain after setting up advantage but Haddad Maia remains in
  the game, forcing a fifth deuce and fifth break point – she takes it. Haddad
  Maia is up 5-1 in the final set and will serve for the match. Oh, now it’s
  Haddad Maia who has pulled up with an issue! Both players are walking wounded.
  Haddad Maia is struggling to properly move and Kartal has a chance to break
  after a backhand that is out of the hampered Haddad Maia’s reach. Kartal sends
  a forehand down the line and is now, suddenly, back in the match. This is
  remarkable. Haddad Maia leads 4-1 in the final set. Haddad Maia, who has
  plenty of support in the crowd, races to three break points as Kartal – who is
  not moving well at all – double-faults to go down a second break. Haddad Maia
  is closing in on victory, up 4-0 in the final set. Kartal seems to be
  struggling with some sort of injury, the tide with Haddad Maia as the former
  nets a backhand. The Brazilian takes a 3-0 lead in the deciding set. Haddad
  Maia is 1-0 up in the third set against Kartal and has three break points …
  she needs just one, this match taking another major swing. Haddad Maia leads
  6-3, 1-6, 2-0. Boulter saved five match points but she can’t deny Kostyuk, who
  secures the win on her serve. The six-time grand slam champion cruises to the
  second round after an hour’s work on Arthur Ashe. Kartal has forced a third
  set against Haddad Maia after winning the second 6-1. Dominant work from the
  Brit, who made seven unforced errors in that set compared to Haddad Maia’s 16.
  Boulter is staring at the exit door, down 0-30 and 3-5 in the second set. A
  successful forehand at the net prompts an emotional release but she follows
  that with a double fault. Kostyuk has two match points. Boulter saves both …
  the second done with a drive volley. But then another ill-timed double fault,
  and Kostyuk has her third match point, and then a fourth, and then a fifth …
  but Boulter shows some stellar defence, with Kostyuk netting a volley.
  Finally, Boulter has advantage, and she takes it with a fine serve down the
  middle. Proper fight from Boulter but she remains a break down. Kostyuk leads
  6-4, 5-4. Kartal isn’t happy with a one-break advantage in the second set …
  she nabs another to lead 5-1 against Haddad Maia. Arango hits her first ace of
  the match but she remains a break down in the second set against Swiatek, who
  leads 6-1, 2-1. Katie Boulter is in trouble. Having lost the first set, she’s
  down a break in the second, with Marta Kostyuk leading 3-1, the last game
  sealed with a cracking forehand winner into the corner. Kostyuk has seven aces
  to Boulter’s none and leads the winners count 13-6. Swiatek isn’t messing
  about. She laces a backhand down the line to take the first set against Arango
  6-1 inside half an hour. Swiatek has 10 winners while Arango is still waiting
  for her first. Kartal and Haddad Maia are having a proper ding-dong. The
  former breaks to go 2-0 up in the second set but Haddad Maia has a break point
  in the third game … she doesn’t get her drop shot right – it’s too light – and
  we’re into deuce. Kartal gets herself out of a hole to go up 3-0. Swiatek is
  down 0-30 on her serve and nearly lands in some trouble with a forehand … but
  it was on the line. She escapes trouble to hold her serve and go 4-1 up.
  Swiatek has two break points as Arango trails 1-2. The defending Wimbledon
  champion converts immediately after Arango slices a backhand into the net.
  Swiatek leads 3-1 in the first set, with no real signs yet of a potential
  upset. Kostyuk takes the first set against Boulter 6-4. A tough start for the
  Brits. There’s another break in the contest between Haddad Maia and Kartal –
  the former is now 5-3 up, serving for the first set. She holds to love, with
  Kartal up against it, struggling to make inroads against Haddad Maia’s first
  serve. Haddad Maia takes the first set 6-3. Iga Swiatek is underway on Arthur
  Ashe, the 2022 US Open champion serving against Emiliana Arango. The second
  seed is up and away, holding her serve to go 1-0 up. Kartal has an opening
  against Haddad Maia’s serve, with the Brazilian down 15-30. A double fault
  gives Kartal two chances to break. Kartal takes the second, victorious in a
  lengthy rally. Haddad Maia now leads 4-3. Boulter, meanwhile, has broken back
  herself, levelling up at 4-4 with Kostyuk. Kartal is on her serve, trailing
  2-3. She completely miscues a forehand to trail 15-30, but Haddad Maia loses
  her own radar when attacking Kartal’s second serve. Haddad Maia has a chance
  to break … but Kartal’s first serve reappears to take us to deuce. Haddad Maia
  gets her second break point when Kartal nets a forehand … and this one is
  converted, Kartal going long with a backhand. Haddad Maia, the 18th seed,
  leads 4-2 in the first set. Boulter has the fist pumps going but she’s also
  taken to deuce by Kostyuk, who has the first chance to break after a crushing
  forehand. She takes it, too, after Boulter nets a backhand. Kostyuk goes 2-1
  up in the first set on Grandstand. Boulter begins her tournament by holding
  serve against Kostyuk. Kartal’s start is less straightforward. Haddad Maia
  takes the first game on her serve as well as the first two points on Kartal’s.
  The 23-year-old shows some ticker to hold. Katie Boulter is up against Marta
  Kostyuk, the 27th seed. Getting to the second round hasn’t been an issue for
  Boulter. She’s got there in five consecutive slams – but can’t find a way to
  get to the third. Her last third-round slam appearance was at the 2023 US
  Open. Sonay Kartal, facing Brazil’s Beatriz Haddad Maia, is looking to build
  on her run to the fourth round at Wimbledon. Hello, hello, hello and welcome
  to the last day of first-round action at Flushing Meadows. We’ve got Iga
  Swiatek and Jannik Sinner leading the cast on Arthur Ashe, and we’ll keep an
  eye on the Brits as well: Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal will kick off at 11am
  local time/4pm BST. Over on Louis Armstrong, we’ll get a look at 10th seed
  Lorenzo Musetti as well as Amanda Anisimova, recent runner-up at Wimbledon.
  The headlines from yesterday include Madison Keys’ early exit, Venus Williams’
  return and, um, Carlos Alcaraz’s haircut. Here’s to some proper thrills today.

She’s serving while down 0-5, and Lys has set point … she wins it as Jones nets a forehand. Jones celebrated reaching the top 100 for the first time last month but is feeling the brutality of the highest level here. Harris overdoes it with a drop shot and Auger-Aliassime capitalises – set point. He converts it, too, with Harris landing a forehand well wide. Auger-Aliassime takes the first set 6-4. Harris has a chance to break against Auger-Aliassime but the 25th seed manages to hold, the game sealed with a deft volley, his lead 5-4. There’s not a great deal separating these two at the moment – they’re level on winners and not far off in terms of unforced errors. Francesca Jones is down a break against Eva Lys, who has produced career-best runs in the other three slams this year, her best effort a fourth-round finish in Australia. Lys leads 3-0 in the first set. Auger-Aliassime holds to love before Harris goes up 30-0 after a 15-shot rally, and Auger-Aliassime fires wide with a forehand return. It’s another love hold, taking the first set to 4-4. Harris breaks Auger-Aliassime thanks to a double fault, with the Canadian leading 3-2. Harris’ confidence grows as he races to a 40-0 lead, and a deep forehand forces a long backhand from Auger-Aliassime. 3-3, and the seeded player is feeling some heat. Harris is forced to deuce but is finally on the board as Auger-Aliassime leads 3-1. There’s another Brit in action on Court 6, with qualifier Francesca Jones meeting Eva Lys. Hello again, friends. There’s British representation over on Stadium 17, with Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime taking on Billy Harris, a lucky loser. The 30-year-old enjoyed the best slam display of his career when he made it to the second round of Wimbledon this year. Auger-Aliassime, the 25th seed, has moved to a 3-0 lead in the first set. That’s all from me – Taha is back! Good night. Job done for the No 8 seed. “It felt great - first matches are not easy to get used to the rhythm,” Iga Swiatek said after thrashing Emiliana Arango 6-1, 6-2 in the first round earlier. “It was a solid match. I am happy I wasn’t trying to overpower.” Is she happy to see all the Polish fans? “Polish fans are kind of everywhere. It’s super-nice to feel the support always … it’s great. But I also appreciate people who come from different countries.” Swiatek lost During the typically chaotic media day before Wimbledon in June, Jannik Sinner and Jack Draper were working through their commitments when they briefly crossed paths in the broadcast media mixed zone. As they warmly greeted each other, Sinner looked his good friend up and down, and a smile spread across his face: “Always stronger,” he said, jokingly flexing both arms. Draper, who responded with a sheepish, embarrassed laugh, has heard such observations many times in recent months. At the same time that he has risen up the rankings over the past 15 months, transforming himself into one of the best in the world, he has become one of the most physically strong players on the ATP Tour. Maya Joint’s extraordinary 2025 success story has begun its latest chapter on another positive note with the fearless Australian youngster successfully negotiating her opening US Open clash at Flushing Meadows. What do you think of Alcaraz’s new barnet? It’ll grow back. In the women’s singles, the seeded players yet to take to the court are as follows: Ashlyn Krueger v Sofia Kenin (26) Laura Siegemund v Diana Shnaider (20) Ekaterina Alexandrova (13) v Anastasija Sevastova What’s coming up in the men’s and women’s singles? Good question. Felix Auger Aliassime is up against Billy Harris on Court 17 imminently. Alex de Minaur (8) is facing his Australian Chris O’Connell a bit later, and Stefanos Tsitsipas (26) v Alexandre Müller will be lighting up Court 7. “It feels great to be back here, it’s a very special tournament, the last grand slam of the year, the atmosphere is always amazing, thanks to everyone for coming, for cheering and supporting,” says Sinner. “I’m feeling healthy again [after illness in Cincinatti] … we did our best to be in the best possible shape … let’s see what’s coming. “Amazing memories,” he says of winning last year. “A lot of emotions coming back to this grand slam. [But] Every day is different.” 'I’m very happy to be back here.” Sinner was “under absolutely no pressure whatsoever” observes one of the commentators. “One way traffic from start to finish,” chips in Tim Henman. “Sinner looking so comfortable, so confident.” Les jeux sont faits. Fun fact: In 2021, Kopriva beat Denis Shapovalov in the second round at the Swiss Open. That is his one win against a top-10 player. Kopriva lost 6-1 6-2 6-2 to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last year. Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 5-2 *Kopriva (*denotes next server) A glimmer for Kopriva at 0-30. Sinner wins an imperious point next up, and it looks like the danger will soon be over, but then Kopriva wins a long rally thanks to a drop shot and a handsome cross-court winner with Sinner coming to the net. Two break points, but very quickly it’s back to deuce, and the Italian wastes one advantage, but makes no such mistake next up. This really is some of the lowest-key tennis I’ve seen in a long time, based on how much bother Kopriva is causing Sinner, ie zero. *Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 4-2 Kopriva (*denotes next server) A precious hold for Kopriva. Are you watching/reading? Mail me. Francisco Cerundolo, the No 19 seed, leads Matteo Arnaldi 3-1 in their fifth and deciding set over on Court 7. Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 4-1 *Kopriva (*denotes next server) Kopriva seems to be mishitting everything. Seems like a case of stagefright, or is there some other bizarre, unknown reason behind this meltdown? *Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 3-1 Kopriva (*denotes next server) At 15-30, Kopriva miscues horribly with a regulation stroke from the back of the court and it’s two break points for Sinner. Then he double faults, handing his illustrious opponent a very easy game. Sinner isn’t having to do much here, and he should be safely through shortly. I can’t even tell you the fun fact about Kopriva hailing from the same Czech town as Petra Kvitova, as I see Taha already mentioned it. Sinner 6-1, 6-1, 2-1 *Kopriva (*denotes next server) A regulation hold for Sinner, to -15, and it remains on serve in the third set. Jack Draper is now pictured, having a hit on one of the back courts, following his win yesterday against the big-hitting Federico Agustín Gómez. Draper faces Zizou Bergs, the world No 48, of Belgium in the second round on Thursday. Thanks Taha. Hi all. Kopriva holds, and it’s 1-1 in the third set. Luke McLaughlin is going to step in while I steal a break. Keep him company. Amanda Anisimova is seeded eighth and up against Australia’s Kimberly Birrell. They’re 1-1 in the opening set, Anisimova looking to build on her run to the final of Wimbledon. That last match in south London was a brutal experience but this is her home slam … and, well, look at that – she races through a hold to lead 2-1. Sinner skips to the net, dictating the point to leave Kopriva stretching for a forehand and on the floor. The No 1 has two set points, and Kopriva provides a double fault. Sinner leads 6-1, 6-1 with just over an hour on the board. Kopriva hails from Fulnek in the Czech Republic and grew up in the same area as Petra Kvitova, who bowed out of the professional game yesterday. Sinner isn’t bothered about the backstory, though; relentless, he breaks once again and leads 4-1 in the second set. Sinner is already up a break in the second set but Kopriva delivers a love hold, closed out with successive aces. The Italian leads 6-1, 2-1. Lorenzo Musetti, the 10th seed, has wrapped up a four-set victory over Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. The Italian, a semi-finalist at Roland Garros this year, triumphs 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. Kopriva finally has some joy, claiming his first game to trail 1-5. Sinner responds with an ace and domination at the net. Kopriva closes a 15-shot rally with a lovely drop shot and saves three set points! Sinner spanks a 127mph ace and Kopriva goes long to extinguish the prospect of any jeopardy. Sinner takes the first set 6-1. Tidy work. OK, time to get to the world No 1. Jannik Sinner is going OK. He’s 5-0 up against Vit Kopriva after just 20 minutes. Decent. Haddad Maia resorts to an underarm serve and Kartal, after saving two match points, has a chance to break! The Brazilian saves it before setting up her third match point … she advances to the net for one last push and it works. Kartal nets and this incredible slog is over. Two players, struggling to move by the end, have put on a serious show. Kartal tries to torture Haddad Maia with a drop shot but the 18th seed gets to it and wins the net battle. Haddad Maia wins another point at the net and she signals her joy to the crowd. A wide forehand from Kartal hands Haddad Maia two break points … but Kartal finds a lift of energy when it matters. She crouches down in pain after setting up advantage but Haddad Maia remains in the game, forcing a fifth deuce and fifth break point – she takes it. Haddad Maia is up 5-1 in the final set and will serve for the match. Oh, now it’s Haddad Maia who has pulled up with an issue! Both players are walking wounded. Haddad Maia is struggling to properly move and Kartal has a chance to break after a backhand that is out of the hampered Haddad Maia’s reach. Kartal sends a forehand down the line and is now, suddenly, back in the match. This is remarkable. Haddad Maia leads 4-1 in the final set. Haddad Maia, who has plenty of support in the crowd, races to three break points as Kartal – who is not moving well at all – double-faults to go down a second break.

Haddad Maia leads 6-3, 1-6, 2-0. Boulter saved five match points but she can’t deny Kostyuk, who secures the win on her serve. The six-time grand slam champion cruises to the second round after an hour’s work on Arthur Ashe. Kartal has forced a third set against Haddad Maia after winning the second 6-1. Dominant work from the Brit, who made seven unforced errors in that set compared to Haddad Maia’s 16. Boulter is staring at the exit door, down 0-30 and 3-5 in the second set. A successful forehand at the net prompts an emotional release but she follows that with a double fault. Kostyuk has two match points. Boulter saves both … the second done with a drive volley. But then another ill-timed double fault, and Kostyuk has her third match point, and then a fourth, and then a fifth … but Boulter shows some stellar defence, with Kostyuk netting a volley. Finally, Boulter has advantage, and she takes it with a fine serve down the middle. Proper fight from Boulter but she remains a break down. Kostyuk leads 6-4, 5-4. Kartal isn’t happy with a one-break advantage in the second set … she nabs another to lead 5-1 against Haddad Maia. Arango hits her first ace of the match but she remains a break down in the second set against Swiatek, who leads 6-1, 2-1. Katie Boulter is in trouble. Having lost the first set, she’s down a break in the second, with Marta Kostyuk leading 3-1, the last game sealed with a cracking forehand winner into the corner. Kostyuk has seven aces to Boulter’s none and leads the winners count 13-6. Swiatek isn’t messing about. She laces a backhand down the line to take the first set against Arango 6-1 inside half an hour. Swiatek has 10 winners while Arango is still waiting for her first. Kartal and Haddad Maia are having a proper ding-dong.
