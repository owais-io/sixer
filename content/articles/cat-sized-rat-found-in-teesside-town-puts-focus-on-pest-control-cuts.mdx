  Cuts to council pest control services are being blamed for a town’s rodent
  problem, which includes the discovery of a supersize rat said to be 22in
  (56cm) from nose to tail. The giant rat, about the length of the carry-on
  luggage people might be wheeling on to a flight – or, if not on holiday, a
  desktop monitor – was found inside a person’s home in Normanby, Teesside. “I
  had to do a double take when I saw a picture of it,” said Stephen Martin, a
  Conservative councillor on Redcar and Cleveland council. “You can tell by the
  size of the bag that it’s not a normal size. It’s the size of a cat.” Martin,
  whose Eston ward is close to where the rat was removed by a pest controller,
  said it was not a one-off. “Rats are being spotted more and more around our
  area. It has been getting worse for a few years now.” As with many
  cash-strapped local authorities, Redcar and Cleveland does not offer a pest
  control service to private residents. Its website says officers can offer free
  advice over the phone, “however, the responsibility for taking action to solve
  a pest problem belongs to the occupant of the property”. But Martin said many
  people did not have the money to pay private pest control companies. He said
  the rat problem often began on council or housing association land “but
  they’re expecting private residents to sort it out”. There are also problems
  with people putting the wrong waste in recycling bins. “Instead of actually
  taking the bins away they are just tagging them, making the resident know it’s
  contaminated, and it is not getting emptied,” he said. “There’s more rubbish
  on the ground and it is attracting more rats and they are just getting bigger
  and bigger and bigger.” Fellow Eston councillor David Taylor said: “I have
  seen a fair few rats but nothing the size of this one. My dog [a cockapoo] can
  often smell rats … I wouldn’t like to think she was tackling that one.” Taylor
  said about five housing estates had been built in quick succession locally,
  which affected infrastructure and moved rats from fields to urban areas. Add
  to that the increase in takeaway food and fly-tipping and there was a perfect
  storm, which needed a coordinated approach, he said. “The rats obviously lived
  in the sewers but they’re now walking the streets. “The problem is UK-wide and
  it needs to be sorted with a joint effort. It needs government, local
  councils, the water boards, private landlords, shops and businesses … all to
  come together.” Taylor said he understood money was tight at Redcar and
  Cleveland council but the problem would just get worse without action. Martin
  said many residents had been in touch to say they had spotted rats around
  bins, in alleyways and crossing the street. He was sent a further picture at
  the weekend of a rat having a go at bins during the day. Martin and Taylor are
  calling for a full vermin survey and treatment plan across the borough. “The
  longer this is ignored, the worse it will get,” they said. A spokesperson for
  Redcar and Cleveland council said: “The council has a dedicated pest control
  officer, who manages pest issues on council-owned land. While we no longer
  provide a wider pest control service, we do offer advice to residents where
  possible. “The council continues to work with Beyond Housing, Northumbrian
  Water and other partners to address complex issues and explore potential
  solutions. “There is also helpful guidance and preventive measures on our
  website to support people in dealing with pests.”
