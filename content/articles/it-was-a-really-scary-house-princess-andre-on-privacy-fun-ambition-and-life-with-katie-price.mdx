  Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther Andre is no stranger to TV. She made her debut
  in the reality show Katie &amp; Peter: The Baby Diaries which documented the
  first six weeks of her life. Her first two years were chronicled in subsequent
  reality shows, until her parents, the model and entrepreneur Katie Price and
  the singer Peter Andre, split up in 2009. Andre continued to make regular
  appearances on her parents’ solo reality shows. Now that she has come of age,
  18-year-old Andre has her own four-part reality show, The Princess Diaries, on
  ITV2. As you would expect, it has already made headlines. While her father is
  a regular on the show, her mother is not. As I approach the cafe in Surrey
  where we are meeting, the Sun and the Mirror publish stories saying that Price
  is devastated not to have been invited to Andre’s 18th birthday party or to
  have been included in the show, adding that her daughter is “too scared” to
  tell the truth about the family rift. So, business as usual. Andre is here
  today with her manager, Marie-Claire Giddings – another echo from the past.
  When Peter and Price were making reality shows together, their manager, Claire
  Powell, was omnipresent. After their bitter divorce, Powell continued to
  manage Peter. Neither she nor Peter talk to Price today. Giddings works for
  Powell. I tell Andre that we have met before. She looks surprised. No wonder.
  Andre was eight months old at the time and I was interviewing her mother.
  There is a symmetry to their lives that astonishes Andre. Price, then known as
  Jordan, was queen of the Page 3 slot in the Sun by 18. “As I started building
  my own career, Mum said it’s crazy that I was your age when I started doing
  these things. I was like: really! I was shocked.” About her doing topless
  modelling at such a young age? “No, that she was so successful at that age.”
  Andre says she probably wouldn’t do topless modelling herself. “That’s not as
  popular nowadays and it just doesn’t appeal to me. But I have nothing against
  anyone who does it, obviously.” She orders a hot chocolate. Price became a
  hugely successful brand. By the time we met in 2007, she had lines in makeup,
  books, bras – you name it – and was worth an estimated £30m, although she was
  subsequently declared bankrupt twice (in 2019 and 2024). Andre says in her
  show that few people are aware of her own ambitions to be a successful
  businesswoman. I show her the headline from the 2007 piece I wrote about her
  mum: “Who wants to be a billionaire?” “No way! That’s crazy.” Would the same
  headline be appropriate for her? “Would I want to be a billionaire? Well,
  that’s my aim!” “You just want to be successful,” Giddings corrects her.
  “Yeah, I just want to be successful and be able to provide for my future and
  my family when I have one,” Andre says. She sips her drink thoughtfully. Then
  she has a brainwave. “I want to take a picture of my hot chocolate,” she says.
  Will it be Instagrammed? She shakes her head. “No, this will be Snapchatted.”
  Giddings laughs. “This is literally my life,” she says apologetically. “So
  don’t feel insulted!” Did Andre always want to star in her own reality show?
  “I always loved being in front of a camera.” She thinks back to when she was a
  toddler on TV. “I’d come in the room and …” She tilts her head to the side, in
  modelling mode. “I loved the entertainment. When I was asked to do my own, I
  was sceptical because of my age, but, yes, I’ve also always wanted to do it.”
  As well as the obvious similarities, there are also huge differences between
  Andre and her mother. While Price is a funny, reckless, potty-mouthed force of
  nature, Andre is more like her father – polite, respectful, more reserved. I
  ask if she ever fancied being a doctor, like her father’s wife, her stepmother
  Emily MacDonagh, who is also prominent in the show. “No, the doctor path was
  never for me.” She went to a private school in Surrey and left to study beauty
  at 16. Were you swotty at school? “What does that mean?” Did you work hard?
  “Oh, yes, in the subjects I liked, I was good. I left after GCSEs.” Did you
  pass them? “Yes,” Giddings answers on her behalf. Andre says: “I passed three
  of them. Music, fashion and English language. I like creative writing. I’m
  quite good at waffling.” Perhaps Andre was destined for a life in reality TV.
  Yet she says she is self-conscious. In the show, she says she always thought
  her nose was too big and her lips too thin and that she “hated” the way she
  looked. Whereas surgery was the answer for her mother, makeup is Andre’s
  solution. “You can change anything with makeup,” she says. “Now, I feel a lot
  more confident.” What made her so self-conscious? “Social media,” she says
  instantly. “When I was younger, I got comments about my appearance.” If this
  was Price, she would tell you every detail. But not Andre. She simply smiles
  and asserts herself. “I don’t let the comments get in the way of anything.” In
  The Princess Diaries, we see her showing her father some of the comments. When
  she tells him that one man has posted about her “finally being legal”, he is
  furious. But that is simply the generational difference, she says. “Dad grew
  up with TV. Social media, TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat weren’t around then.
  Those comments are everyday, normalised, so they don’t really shock me.” In
  Andre’s world, you live and die by social media. As an “influencer”, you are
  nothing without it, however hurtful it can be. I tell her that, as an old git,
  I have never quite understood what it is to be an influencer; I ask if she can
  explain. “I guess it’s someone who influences people to do stuff. I influence
  younger people with what I post.” Does she influence what they wear and buy?
  “Yeah. My content is very organic, though – very real. Make up stories, which
  is what I do.” Giddings, a former tabloid journalist, rushes to the rescue.
  “Makeup! Not as in ‘making up stories’. I didn’t want you to think she’s
  sitting there busy making up stories.” Does she get paid to promote stuff?
  “Yes. I don’t get paid for normal posts. I like to post for my audience out of
  choice, not because I’m getting paid for it. But then there are branded posts
  or PR posts that I would get paid for.” Giddings: “But it’s only brands that
  she’s using already.” Andre: “I would never promote a brand that I don’t like
  or don’t have an interest in.” Are you making a good living out of it? “Yeah.”
  Are you wealthy? “Well, you could say so!” How much do you earn in a year? “I
  can’t tell you that, sorry.” The most important brand is, of course, Andre
  herself. She prides herself on being natural (no fillers, no Botox), but
  stresses that it’s neither a political nor a permanent position. When she was
  training as a beautician, it was an area of interest. “I would have loved to
  have done that as a job,” she says. “I was going to go into aesthetics, doing
  other people’s fillers and stuff, ’cos the way it works interests me. But
  personally I don’t think I will get any, just because my audience is so young.
  I want to be an inspiration for them. You should love yourself for you and not
  have to change yourself.” Has her mother, who has had numerous surgical
  augmentations and reductions, advised her on this? “Yeah. Mum said: ‘Don’t
  ever get anything done to yourself. You’re so beautiful the way you are.’ I
  found that interesting because I get told I look a lot like her at a young
  age. She’ll say to me: ‘In that picture, you look just like me when I was
  younger.’” Does she think Price regrets all her surgery? “No. There are
  pictures that I’ve seen of her before [surgery] and I was like: ‘You look so
  beautiful then,’ and she’s like: ‘No!’ She doesn’t see it. So I don’t think
  she does regret it.’” *** In her show, Andre says she wishes her childhood had
  been happier, but she doesn’t go into details. Today, I ask if she can explain
  a bit more. Instead, she chooses to explain a bit less, telling me that she
  has so many happy memories from childhood – holidays, riding horses, having
  fun with her siblings. You sense she wants to give just enough to satisfy
  reality TV, but not so much that she ransacks her privacy. I ask again about
  the unhappiness. “Oh!” she says. Giddings prompts her. “You talk about South
  Africa in the show.” “Oh yeah, we got hijacked in South Africa when I was 10
  and [her brother] Junior was 12. I was terrified. We were filming for a show
  with mum and her best friend.” It does sound terrifying. They were surrounded
  by six gunmen and her mother was sexually assaulted. “It’s one of the worst
  things I’ve experienced in my life. You don’t think of anything else apart
  from trying to survive it. The police said it was a miracle that we all
  survived.” It still affects her. “I get scared of the dark and driving at
  night-time, ’cos that’s when it happened. I get random flashbacks. If I’m
  driving at night, I’m like: ‘Oh my God, just get me home.’ I don’t even look
  behind me.” There are other sources of unhappiness that she prefers not to go
  into: her parents splitting up; Price’s separation from her third husband,
  Kieran Hayler, the father of two of Andre’s siblings. She had been close to
  Hayler, but now they don’t see each other. Many of Price’s reality shows were
  set in the aptly named Mucky Mansion, a nine-bedroom property in Sussex
  formerly owned by Price. Did Andre like living there? “No. It was a really
  scary house. A lot went on there. So I didn’t really like it.” Again, she
  doesn’t go into details. “I guess when you have bad experiences somewhere you
  don’t like the place.” A few years ago, Price experienced severe depression
  and became suicidal. In 2021, she had a terrible car crash while under the
  influence of alcohol and drugs. By this point, Andre and Junior had been
  living with their father full-time for three years. “There was a period of
  time when me and Junior actually had to live with my dad,” she says, referring
  to a 2019 family court order made public this week by her father. (In
  response, a spokesperson for Price said she was “at peace with the
  situation”.) Andre says Price is in a much better place; she moves between
  their homes depending on how she feels. “Dad’s house is a lot quieter, a lot
  more peaceful, a lot more organised. Whereas my mum’s house is much more just
  do what you want.” Does she prefer discipline or chaos? “I love being in the
  middle. I love the two different houses, because if I fancy a bit more chaotic
  and busy I’ll go to Mum’s and if I fancy more relaxed I’ll go to Dad’s.” Has
  her father been a stabilising influence? She looks at Giddings anxiously.
  “This is going to come across really bad, isn’t it?” she asks. “Like, it’s
  talking about how Mum’s a mess and Dad is stable, d’you know what I mean?”
  It’s touching how protective she is of Price. She turns back to me. “Right
  now, Mum is completely different to how she was four years ago. If we’re
  talking about the past, yes, my dad was more stable and Mum is naturally more
  crazy than my dad.” “Not crazy!” Giddings corrects. “Out there!” “If you saw
  her now, she’s way different,” Andre says. She talks about how close she is to
  all seven of her siblings, giving a special mention to Theo and Millie, the
  eldest of Peter and MacDonagh’s children, who are born entertainers, she says.
  Has she learned a lot from growing up with Harvey, Price’s eldest child, who
  is severely disabled and a reality star in his own right? Her eyes light up.
  “Yes, 100%. You learn patience. Ways of communicating. How to deal with his
  outbursts. How to calm him down. And as much as he is hard work, he is the
  funniest person I know.” I ask if he is still into trains. “He loves trains.
  He loves frogs. He loves rainbows. And food.” “Well, you’ve got that in
  common,” Giddings says. I mention the stories that have just been published
  online, saying Price is upset with Andre. The thing is, Andre says, there will
  generally be some truth in the tabloid tales, but it won’t be the truth. Take
  the reality show. While it’s true that Price wasn’t filmed for it, we do hear
  mother and daughter chatting lovingly on the phone. “There’s been a lot of
  articles about ‘Princess doesn’t want her mum in the show’,” she says. Why was
  that decision made? “There was actually no decision, really. But because I’m
  living with Dad at the moment, he was in it more.” Well, that and the fact
  that her management team is also Andre’s management team. “It was never true
  that I said I didn’t want her in it,” she insists. As for the idea of Peter
  Andre and Price being in it together, that never would have happened. “They
  don’t like each other,” she says, simply. Which takes us to Birthdaygate. Yes,
  it’s true that Price wasn’t invited to the party Princess had with Peter’s
  family, but that was never on the cards. “It would be quite strange for my mum
  and dad to be in it at the same time, just because that’s never been the case
  in my life since they split up.’’ The reality is she would usually spend part
  of her birthday with each parent, she says. “The problem is the media like to
  twist the knife,” she says. Ah, but this time it isn’t the media twisting the
  knife, Giddings says. “It was your mum that put that story out there.” “Yeah,”
  Andre says, searching for a diplomatic response. “Which is … interesting.”
  “That was Kate that said all of that about her and her family not being
  invited,” Giddings continues. Why don’t you just ring your mum and ask her
  what she is playing at, I suggest. No, she says, it’s not worth it. “Mum can
  be annoyed about something and then we send each other a message and we’re
  fine.” Blimey, I say, it’s not easy having parents is it? “No,” she says.
  “Especially divorced parents.” Andre hopes her reality show is the gateway to
  a successful business career. She says she understands the positives and the
  pitfalls. “No matter what I do in my life, I’ll get compared to my mum. I
  guess it’s always going to be a headline.” And now it’s up to Andre to show
  the world whether that has been her fortune or misfortune. • The Princess
  Diaries is on ITVX now • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
