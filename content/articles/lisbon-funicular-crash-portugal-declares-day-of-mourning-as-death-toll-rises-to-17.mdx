  Portugal has declared a day of national mourning after at least 17 people were
  killed and 21 others injured when one of the city’s famous funicular cars
  derailed and crashed into a building on Wednesday evening. An emergency
  services spokesperson said some foreign nationals were among the dead but did
  not identify the victims or disclose their nationalities. The injured people,
  three of whom were seriously hurt, were being treated in several hospitals in
  the Lisbon region. Two of the most badly injured victims died in hospital
  overnight, raising the initial death toll from 15 to 17. Teams of pathologists
  from the National Forensics Institute worked through the night on autopsies,
  officials said. Public prosecutors have launched an investigation into the
  cause of the crash, which happened just after 6pm on Wednesday as the evening
  rush hour began. Known as Elevador da Glória, the vehicle goes up and down a
  steep hill in central Lisbon in tandem with one going the opposite way.
  Footage showed the wreckage of the yellow-and-white car lying on its side in
  the narrow street it traverses. Its sides and top were crumpled, and it
  appeared to have crashed into a building where the road bends. Parts of the
  vehicle, made mostly of metal, were crushed. Witnesses told local media that
  the streetcar careened down the hill, apparently out of control. “It hit the
  building with brutal force and fell apart like a cardboard box,” Teresa d’Avó
  told the TV channel SIC. Another witness, Bruno Pereira, told CNN Portugal
  that the car at the bottom of the hill had suddenly jerked off the track and
  on to the pavement, just before the other one came hurtling down, “and struck
  the walls like a rock”. “A few seconds later, the other tram – which
  counterbalances this one – arrived, completely out of control, crashing into
  the walls, people screaming. It hit the last time at the curve between Calçada
  da Glória and Rua da Glória and stopped with a loud crash,” he said. “There
  was panic. We all ran, everyone there. Some people tried to pull people out
  from under the tram … There were cobblestones everywhere, and the metal
  grooves, on which the car ran, were all popped out.” Lisbon’s mayor, Carlos
  Moedas, who visited the scene shortly after news of the crash emerged, said
  the city was in mourning. “This is a tragedy that has never happened before in
  our city,” he told reporters. “Now is the time for action and help. I thank
  everyone for their response in just a few minutes. The only thing I can say is
  that it’s a very tragic day.” The government declared that Thursday would be a
  day of national mourning. A statement from the office of the prime minister,
  Luís Montenegro, said the tragedy had “brought grief to … families and dismay
  to the country”. The president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, lamented the crash
  and expressed hope that authorities would soon establish its cause. The Glória
  line, which carries about 3 million people annually, is one of three funicular
  lines operated by the municipal public transport company Carris, and is used
  by tourists as well as residents. Its two cars, each capable of carrying about
  40 people, are attached to opposite ends of a haulage cable with traction
  provided by electric motors on the cars. Carris said “all maintenance
  protocols have been carried out”, including monthly and weekly maintenance
  programmes and daily inspections. Lisbon’s city council suspended operations
  of other streetcars and ordered immediate inspections, local media reported.
  The crash brought condolences from European political leaders. Pedro Sánchez,
  the prime minister of neighbouring Spain, said he was saddened by the
  “terrible accident” in Lisbon, adding: “We send all our love and solidarity to
  the families of the victims and to the Portuguese people at this difficult
  time. We also hope that those who have been injured will get better quickly.”
  Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said he had met his Portuguese
  counterpart and expressed his “solidarity with the victims”. The European
  Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, expressed her sadness and offered
  her condolences to the families of the victims. A spokesperson for the UK’s
  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was in touch with the
  local authorities and stood by “to provide consular assistance if there are
  any affected British nationals”. Portugal, and Lisbon in particular, has
  experienced a tourism boom in the past decade, with visitors cramming into the
  popular downtown area in the summer months. Reuters and the Associated Press
