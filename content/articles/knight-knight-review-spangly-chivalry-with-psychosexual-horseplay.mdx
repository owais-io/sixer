  Academic texts have been written about the bond between knights and their
  steeds in chivalric romances. US clown Madeleine Rowe’s contribution to the
  field is an hour of whimsical horseplay with psychosexual trappings. Here,
  it’s the beast that mounts the knight – and rather vigorously, too. Our host
  is clad in tunic and spangly chainmail jumpsuit. The hobby horse named Hermes
  is one of a number of toyshop props including a plastic Excalibur and crown
  used in daffy episodes of audience participation. Rowe’s script has a
  “methinks” here and a “prithee” there, the knight’s prophecy and quest
  unfolding to sweeping Celtic orchestrations across We’re Going on a Bear
  Hunt-style terrain. You’d be right to assume that sword innuendo is embraced
  when possible but Rowe also has fun with gender norms and social structures
  seen through an Arthurian lens. This knight is consumed by confusion (“Kings
  can’t do what we’ve done!” he tells Hermes) as he seeks a meekly obedient wife
  among us and plucks up wedding eve courage to overcome his bilious reaction to
  consummate the marriage by doing it, gulp, “how humans do it”. Physical comedy
  enhances these interactions – the removal of just belt and tunic becomes a
  drawn out striptease – and Rowe’s vocal work is particularly deft. There’s the
  gruffness of Adam Riches channelling Sean Bean as a swaggering adventurer (a
  character Riches is reprising this fringe to read Le Morte d’Arthur). To the
  mix, Rowe adds mock solemnity as well as a lovely lilt. Single vowels are
  elongated out of shape, going from gravelly to awestruck to sweetly
  sentimental. Rowe’s twinkle-eyed charisma can’t quite conceal the fact that
  each episode is stretched for too long, the pace occasionally needs to giddy
  up and it’s a one-note joke, albeit an inspired one. But if this is not the
  holy grail of fringe comedy, Rowe still gives us a knight to remember. • At
  Underbelly, George Square, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh
