  More than 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis from a Jewish art dealer
  in Amsterdam, a portrait by an Italian master has been spotted on the website
  of an estate agent advertising a house for sale in Argentina. A photo shows
  the painting, Portrait of a Lady (Contessa Colleoni) by the late-baroque
  portraitist Giuseppe Ghislandi, also known as Fra’ Galgario, hanging above a
  sofa in the living room of the property, in a seaside town near Buenos Aires.
  The Dutch newspaper AD said it had traced the work, which features in a
  database of lost art and is listed by the Dutch culture ministry as
  “unreturned” after the second world war, after a long investigation – and with
  the unwitting help of the estate agent. Portrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques
  Goudstikker, a leading Dutch art dealer who fled the Netherlands in mid-May
  1940 to escape the invading Nazis but died after falling in the hold of the
  vessel carrying him to safety and breaking his neck. Within weeks,
  Goudstikker’s entire collection of more than 1,100 artworks, including
  numerous paintings catalogued as old masters, had been bought up, in a forced
  sale and for a small fraction of its true value, by Reichsmarschall Hermann
  Göring. After the second world war, some works were recovered in Germany and
  displayed as part of the Dutch national collection in the Rijkmuseum, before
  202 were restored to the dealer’s sole surviving heir, his daughter-in-law
  Marei von Saher, in 2006. Portrait of a Lady was not among them. AD said it
  had uncovered wartime documents suggesting the painting was one of two in the
  possession of Friedrich Kadgien, a Nazi official, SS officer and senior aide
  to Göring, who fled to Switzerland in 1945. Kadgien – described by US
  interrogators as “not a true Nazi” but “a snake of the lowest sort” –
  subsequently left Switzerland for Brazil then Argentina, the paper said, where
  he started a company and a family and died in 1978, aged 71. The paper said it
  had made attempts over several years to speak to the late Nazi’s two daughters
  in Buenos Aires about their father and the missing artworks, but had been
  consistently rebuffed. Eventually, a reporter was dispatched to knock on
  doors. “There was certainly someone at home, we saw a shadow moving in the
  corridor, but no one opened,” the journalist, Peter Schouten, reported back.
  “By the way, the house is for sale,” he added, attaching a link to the agency,
  Robles Casas &amp; Campos. The AD reporter Cyril Rosman said: “As I opened the
  link the next morning, I started scrolling through the interior photos of the
  property. Was there anything that said more about Kadgien’s past? Then I saw
  it. That painting, above the sofa – photo five …” The paper said art
  historians believed the painting had every appearance of being the missing
  work by Ghislandi, one of Italy’s most important late-17th and
  early-18th-century portraitists, whose works are on display in several museums
  around the world. Bram de Klerck of Radboud University in Nijmegen said the
  composition was “identical” and the dimensions and colours appeared to match
  earlier black-and-white photographs, but warned he could not say more based on
  a photo. Two researchers at the Dutch government’s cultural heritage service,
  Annelies Kool and Perry Schrier, also told AD there was “no reason to imagine”
  it was a copy, adding that only an examination of the painting itself could
  provide confirmation. In addition, Kool and Schrier said they believed they
  had uncovered a photo of a second missing work known to have belonged to
  Kadgien, a still life by the 17th-century Dutch artist Abraham Mignon, in a
  social media post by one of his daughters. AD said all attempts to speak to
  the sisters since the discovery of the photo had failed, with one reportedly
  telling the paper: “I don’t know what information you want from me and I don’t
  know what painting you are talking about.” A US lawyer for the Goudstikker
  estate told the paper the dealer’s heirs would make every effort to recover
  the work, and von Saher, 81, said she would not give up her search for the
  artworks owned by her late father-in-law, which began in the 1990s. “My family
  aims to bring back every single artwork robbed from Jacques’ collection, and
  to restore his legacy,” von Saher said.
