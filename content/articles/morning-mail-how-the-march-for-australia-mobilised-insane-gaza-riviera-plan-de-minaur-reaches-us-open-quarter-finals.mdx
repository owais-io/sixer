  Morning everyone. Our reporters have been digging into the way organisers
  mobilised support for the weekend’s anti-immigration March for Australia –
  especially by using the shield of “ordinary mums and dads” to push the idea of
  white supremacy. Also today, Labor faces renewed pressure over its aged care
  and Nauru deportation plans; leaked White House plans for a “Gaza Riviera”
  have attracted widespread derision; and how the TV show Blue Murder still
  packs a punch, even after 30 years. Plus: de Minaur is through to the US Open
  quarter-finals. Australia Larrakia return | A collection of weapons and
  ceremonial objects taken from the Larrakia people more than a century ago is
  on its way back to the Northern Territory after being returned by Bristol city
  council in the UK. Aged care anger | Labor could be forced to bring on
  immediate funding for new in-home aged care services as the Coalition, Greens
  and crossbench MPs team up in the Senate in anger over the government’s
  refusal to address growing shortages, ahead of a new system beginning in
  November. Robot reboot | Alex Proyas, the Australian film-maker behind The
  Crow and I, Robot, claims AI technology will “streamline” the film workforce
  but will make projects easier and cheaper and help fix a “broken” industry.
  ‘Daddy quota’ | Rank-and-file Victorian Liberal party members will use this
  month’s state council meeting to push for a regulated cannabis market for
  adult use, overhaul heritage and planning laws and introduce a full year of
  parental leave with a “daddy quota”. ‘A great man’ | Joe Bugner, the British
  heavyweight who went the distance with boxing legends Muhammad Ali and Joe
  Frazier in the 1970s, has died in a care home in Brisbane at the age of 75.
  World ‘Gaza Riviera’ | A plan circulating in the White House to develop the
  “Gaza Riviera” as a string of hi-tech megacities has been dismissed as an
  “insane” attempt to provide cover for large-scale ethnic cleansing. It comes
  as leading genocide scholars back a resolution stating that Israel’s actions
  in Gaza meet the legal definition of the crime. Afghan horror | Afghans caught
  in an earthquake in the country’s Kunar province have described their terror
  as the “walls collapsed around me” and they saw children and relatives injured
  or killed. At least 800 people have died. Russian jam | Russia is believed to
  have jammed the satellite signal of a plane carrying the European Commission
  president, Ursula von der Leyen, over Bulgaria, reportedly forcing it to
  circle the airport for an hour. Fed warning | Donald Trump’s attempt to
  influence the US Federal Reserve could pose a “very serious danger” for the
  world economy, the head of the European Central Bank has warned. Bell toll |
  An 11-year-old boy playing a common prank game of ringing doorbells in
  Houston, Texas, has been shot dead as he ran away from a house. Full Story
  Australia’s ‘secret’ deportation deal with Nauru – podcast Ben Doherty speaks
  to Nour Haydar about why critics have labelled the government’s plan to deport
  people to its Pacific neighbour “disgraceful and dangerous”. Anthony Albanese
  has insisted there’s “nothing secret” about a $400m deal with Nauru to offload
  hundreds of non-citizens to the tiny Pacific island as questions mount over
  the agreement’s fine print. In-depth The weekend’s March for Australia played
  on “the return to an imagined white Australia”, experts have told our
  reporters, and organisers used the shield of “ordinary mums and dads” to sell
  white supremacy. Elon Musk shared a post on social media that wrongly claimed
  150,000 people took part in anti-immigration protests in the Australian cities
  of Sydney and Brisbane, though police estimated the total at about 21,000. Not
  the news Bailey Smith’s celebrity status and a history of indiscretions made
  many doubt he could fit into Geelong’s winning machine. But the midfielder’s
  revelations about his struggle with mental health has shone new light on his
  journey to the top of the game ahead of his team’s finals clash against
  Brisbane on Friday. Sport Tennis | Alex de Minaur (above) is through to the
  last eight of the US open in New York after a rapid straight sets win over the
  Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi. There’s plenty more action to come and you can
  follow it live. Athletics | Eliud Kipchoge, the great Kenyan marathon runner,
  tells Martin Pegan about the transformative experience of distance running,
  inspiring the next generation and Sydney’s “beautiful and unique” course.
  Football | Liverpool have paid a British record £125m ($A250m) to buy
  Alexander Isak from Newcastle, but a £35m deal to take England defender Mark
  Guehi to Anfield from Crystal Palace fell through as the transfer window
  closed. Erik ten Hag has been sacked as Bayer Leverkusen manager after two
  league games. Media roundup Writing in the Age, Bob Carr has defended his
  decision to attend China’s security summit. Sydney taxi drivers face being
  banned from Sydney airport if they are caught scamming passengers, the
  Telegraph claims. Allowing people to throw axes inside a club on Adelaide’s
  premier party strip is too dangerous despite being an “enjoyable experience”,
  a judge has ruled, according to the Advertiser. What’s happening today
  Canberra | Farmers for Climate Action will hold the Farming Forever summit.
  Sydney | There is a media call for Sydney’s Fringe festival. Sign up If you
