  A men’s only club in Sydney has banned sockettes. Is it Victorian-era modesty
  or fashion policing below the ankle?

  Caitlin. A literal “boys’ club” I haven’t heard of has banned a type of sock.
  What’s going on? Hold my prosecco and plate of canapes, do I have a story for
  you. According to the Australian Financial Review, the elite private members
  Australian Club in Sydney has embarked on a war on men’s socks, and the common
  sockette is in the firing line. As per the AFR, the club secretary has
  distributed amendments to its dress requirements for the clubhouse, which
  requires that jackets be “tailored” and that socks – which, they note, “must
  be worn by gentlemen” – should cover above the ankle. I can only assume the
  fashion police will be waiting at the doors, and if you have a low-rise ankle
  sock on, or, even worse, no sock at all, you’re in danger. I thought private
  members’ clubs were from the 18th century. We still have them? Unfortunately,
  yes. The Australian Club is actually the oldest gentlemen’s club in the
  southern hemisphere, established in 1838 as a private, men’s only
  establishment. It’s part of a string of reciprocal elite clubs around the
  globe, including the Melbourne Club and Athenaeum Club, also in Melbourne.
  According to its website, the Sydney club, situated at 165 Macquarie Street,
  boasts “unparalleled views” of the Botanic Gardens and north shore, “where
  tradition and modernity are skilfully blended”. Sockettes, presumably, do not
  count in that skilful blend. Wow that’s so retro. How is it still men’s only?
  Ima, be reasonable. When it opened, this was a different era. It was 1838!
  Women couldn’t vote, hold political office or own property in their own right.
  But yeah, it’s still a boys’ club. In 2021, 62% of its members, who include
  John Howard and Malcom Turnbull, controversially rejected a proposal to allow
  women to join (though we don’t know how the former prime ministers voted),
  with some fearing the “atmosphere” of the club could be “irreparably damaged”.
  Women are welcome to stay in the clubhouse and use facilities when a member is
  with them though! They just can’t go on the first floor until after 5pm.
  Right, that makes sense. A “no girls allowed” vibe. So what were the rules for
  entry before? A pretty stringent dress code has always been in place. Members
  and their “gentlemen guests” have to wear a jacket and tie (though on the
  “relaxed” third floor, ties are optional), and “ladies” can wear a dress,
  skirt, tailored trousers with a jacket or evening pants. No denim is allowed,
  and don’t even think about sports shoes. This is the Australian Club – not the
  wild west. So. Many. Questions. If pants are a prerequisite, why ban
  sockettes? Not cute, but don’t they remain out of sight? Or are more members
  rocking a three-quarter chino these days? If an exposed ankle is the cause of
  scandal … is it the sensuality of a man’s lower leg? I don’t want to think
  about the sensuality of an old man’s leg. But honestly, if it were me making
  the rules, I would ban sockettes on the basis they’re just a bit daggy. I
  mean, their slightly longer cousin, ankle socks, have been colloquially
  referred to as “millennial socks” because they’re such a fashion faux pas
  among youth. And the Australian Club is all about “modernity”. Its members may
  have a median age above 60, but that doesn’t mean they’re not sailing on the
  winds of contemporary fashion. I’m with the secretary. Get with the times, I
  say, and pull up your socks.
