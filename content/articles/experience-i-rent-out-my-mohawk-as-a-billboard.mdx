  Until seven years ago, I had a really neat flat top. I was a volunteer in the
  playground at my kids’ school in Littleton, Colorado, and when the school
  announced they were going to have a Crazy Hair Day for dads, I said, “Let’s do
  a mohawk!” My kids thought it was a great idea. So I went to the barber shop
  and came back with a small mohawk. My wife, Julie, wasn’t so keen, and I
  promised I’d shave it off the next day. But my hair went down really well in
  the playground and I decided to keep it like that for a while. The community
  we live in is a small one and very conservative, but everyone seemed to accept
  my new look, even though some people said I must be having a midlife crisis.
  Julie works in education and had no real experience of styling anyone’s hair
  when she started helping with mine. Through trial and error she got really
  good at it – now she’s the artist and I’m her palette. I think the first
  picture mohawk we did was a phoenix, then an Irish flag to celebrate Saint
  Patrick’s Day. After that, I’d just suggest whatever came into my head. My
  mohawk became a billboard for music I liked – Lynyrd Skynyrd, Metallica,
  Modern English – as well as important causes, both local and international.
  I’d also celebrate birthdays and memorialise people who had died. My boss at
  the grocery store where I worked made no objection, perhaps partly because
  people would come in just to see what design I was wearing that day. I loved
  creating holiday mohawks. I’ve had the Easter bunny pooping jelly beans on my
  head, while for Halloween I’d go out with it covered in cartoon pumpkins. At
  Christmas, Julie would paint it green and decorate it with real fairy lights
  and baubles, or shape it into a pair of reindeer antlers. Early on, we started
  posting pictures of our designs on Facebook and later we opened an account on
  Instagram, too. That’s when I started to get attention from outside our town,
  quickly racking up followers. About a year in, I received my first commission
  – a doughnut shop in Washington DC got in touch to ask if I had ever
  considered putting the name of a company on my mohawk. We didn’t know what to
  charge so we just said $75 (£56), and were astonished when they paid.
  Nowadays, we make sure to always have about a dozen colours of spray in our
  cupboard, as you never know from one day to the next what people are going to
  ask for. We’ve bought a proper stencil machine, too. At first, Julie cut those
  out by hand, and did a pretty good job, but now they’re perfect every time.
  Getting the mohawk up takes about 15 minutes, but painting it can take
  anything from one to three hours. Some weeks I become burned out and take a
  little break, but on others we’ll do five paid ads on one side of my mohawk
  and five of our own design on the other. We charge more now; we’ve reached the
  point where the mohawk commissions pay all our bills and I don’t have to go
  out to work. I’ve learned to avoid any overtly political messages, as when
  you’re posting on social media they can become an open door to hell. But I
  enjoy recording short videos and reels to back up the messages on my hair. My
  aim when I started out was “Bringing back smiles, one mohawk at a time”. And,
  several thousand mohawks later, that hasn’t changed. At this point, I have
  thousands of followers across my various platforms, do public appearances and
  have been in a music video and a couple of movies. Given that all this started
  as a joke, it’s amazing where it has ended up. We’re even looking at opening a
  themed business, The Mohawk Bob Bar &amp; Grill. Nowadays, my mohawk is 14in
  (35cm) tall – a good size for painting messages on, but not too large to be
  impractical. I’ve seen specimens much taller than mine, but something that big
  wouldn’t fit in my car. Despite everything I’ve put it through, I still have a
  solid hairline for a 58-year-old – I’ve been pretty lucky with that. Perhaps
  one day it’ll all fall out and I’ll have to start faking it, but until then, I
  don’t think my mohawk’s ever coming off. • As told to Chris Broughton Do you
