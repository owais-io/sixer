  If the key stylistic reference in Shostakovich’s symphonies from the Fifth
  onwards would unmistakably be Mahler, his early symphonies show a much more
  catholic array of influences, and often hint at other directions his music
  might have taken had events in the Soviet Union allowed him the freedom of
  choice. The First Symphony in particular, composed in 1924-25, is an energised
  bundle of ideas derived from many sources, with the Stravinsky of Petrushka
  and the early neoclassicism of Paul Hindemith vying for supremacy in music
  that careers along with sudden changes of direction – alternating exuberance
  with flashes of pathos – which never fail to surprise. In what is the latest
  instalment of their Shostakovich series for Chandos, John Storgårds and the
  BBC Philharmonic are more effective in maintaining the momentum of the faster
  music than they are in registering the moments of deeper, darker emotion, so
  that a crucial dimension often seems to be lacking. It’s the rendition of the
  much less frequently performed and recorded Third Symphony, composed four
  years after the First, in 1929, that’s the more convincing here. In between
  these works, the Second Symphony, composed for the 10th anniversary of the
  October revolution in 1927, contained some of the most radical music
  Shostakovich would ever compose, while the single-movement Third, subtitled
  “The First of May” and which ends with a tub-thumping hymn celebrating
  International Workers Day, takes a step back and is distinctly less
  iconoclastic. But Storgårds skilfully negotiates its changes of gear and he
  pairs the symphonies with real curiosities – two pieces, both scherzos, that
  pre-date even the First Symphony. Scherzo No 1, which Shostakovich designated
  as his Op 1, was composed in 1919 when he was just 13 years old; it was
  dedicated to his composition teacher Maximilian Steinberg and shows the
  influence of Glazunov more than anyone else. While in Scherzo No 2, completed
  in 1924, Stravinsky has become part of the mix, and the First Symphony is just
  around the corner. Listen on Apple Music (above) or Spotify
