  These skewers are a summer favourite in my house. The rich buffalo sauce pairs
  perfectly with the tangy blue cheese dressing and fresh, crunchy salad. I’ve
  used the award-winning Tesco Finest Stratford blue, produced at a family dairy
  in Lancashire, which adds a rich and creamy kick to the dish. The chicken can
  be cooked on a griddle pan or barbecue, but if using wood skewers, soak them
  in water for at least 30 minutes before barbecuing so they don’t burn. Prep 40
  min Cook 25 min Serves 4 860g Tesco Finest British free-range chicken thigh
  fillets, quartered 1 tbsp Tesco Finest Sicilian extra virgin olive oil 130ml
  hot sauce 2 tsp sweet smoked paprika 11⁄2 tsp garlic granules 11⁄2 tbsp light
  brown sugar 11⁄2 tbsp white wine vinegar 60g Tesco Finest west country butter
  &amp; sea salt For the salad 1 Tesco Finest sweetheart lettuce, washed and
  roughly sliced 3 sticks celery, thinly sliced 4 spring onions, thinly sliced
  130g Tesco Finest Greek yoghurt 50g mayonnaise 1 lemon, juice Half bunch
  chives, finely chopped 60g Tesco Finest Stratford blue cheese, crumbled 60ml
  whole milk Suggested wine pairing Tesco Finest Steep Slopes Mosel riesling
  Place the chicken in a large bowl, season with salt and mix in the olive oil.
  Heat a saucepan and add the hot sauce, paprika, sugar, garlic granules,
  vinegar and butter. Stir until melted then simmer for 2 minutes, stirring
  continuously. Remove from the heat. Thread the chicken on to four skewers,
  compacting the pieces tightly together. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat.
  Add the skewers and cook for 10 minutes, turning regularly, then baste with a
  third of the buffalo sauce. Keep turning, cooking for a further 7-10 minutes
  or until lightly charred and cooked through. Alternatively you can barbecue
  the skewers. Make sure the embers have turned white if you’re using a coal
  barbecue and grill for the same length of time. Meanwhile, toss the lettuce,
  celery and spring onions in a large bowl. In a separate bowl mix the yoghurt,
  mayonnaise, lemon juice, chives and half the crumbled cheese. Loosen with the
  milk to create a dressing. Season to taste. Reheat the buffalo sauce left in
  the pan until loosened and warmed through then spoon over the cooked chicken
  skewers. Toss the salad with roughly half the dressing and the remaining
  crumbled cheese, and serve with the skewers. Use the last of the dressing as a
  dip. Shop the ingredients for this recipe on Tesco.com and discover how Tesco
  Finest can make your everyday taste better
