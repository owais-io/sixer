  If you were a football fan who owned a computer in the early 1980s, there is
  one game you will instantly recall. The box had an illustration of the FA Cup,
  and in the bottom right-hand corner was a photo of a smiling man with curly
  hair and a goatee beard. You’d see the same images in gaming magazines adverts
  – they ran for years because, despite having rudimentary graphics and very
  basic sounds, the game was an annual bestseller. This was Football Manager,
  the world’s first footie tactics simulation. The man on the cover was Kevin
  Toms, the game’s creator and programmer. The story behind the game is typical
  for the whiz-kid era, when lone coders would bash out bestselling ZX Spectrum
  and Commodore 64 titles in their bedrooms and then end up driving Ferraris
  around with the proceeds. As a child in the early 1970s, Toms was a huge
  football fan and an amateur game designer – only then it was board games, as
  no one had a computer at home. “When my parents went to see my careers master,
  I said: ‘Ask him if it’s possible to get a job as a games designer,’” says
  Toms. “He told them: ‘It’s a phase, he’ll grow out of it.’” He didn’t.
  Throughout the 1970s, he worked as a programmer on corporate mainframes and
  for a while he was coding at the Open University. “It wasn’t long before I
  realised I could write games on these things,” he says. “Actually, the first
  game I made was on a programmable calculator.” In 1980, Toms bought a Video
  Genie computer, largely considered a clone of the TRS-80, one of the major
  early home micros. “I realised I could write the football manager board game
  I’d been trying to make for years on a computer,” he says. “There were two
  major advantages – it could calculate the league tables for me and I could
  work out an algorithm to arrange the fixtures.” The Video Genie never took off
  – but then Toms bought a ZX81 with a 16k RAM extension and ported the game to
  that. “In January 1982, I placed a quarter-page ad in Computer and Video Games
  magazine and it started to take off,” he says. “I can still remember the first
  letter arriving with a cheque in it. In the first few months I sold 300
  games.” At this time, the game was extremely basic – there were no graphics,
  just text. Players picked a team from a selection of 16 and then had to act as
  its manager: buying players, deciding on a squad, then tweaking the side as it
  went through the season. You started at the bottom of the old fourth division
  and worked your way up. Toms wrote his own algorithms to generate fixtures and
  also decide the outcomes of the matches based on the stats of the teams
  playing. “The difficult part was the player attributes,” he says. “I gave them
  a skill rating out of five, but then I wanted a counter-balance that so you
  couldn’t just buy the best players and leave them in the side for the whole
  season – there had to be a reason to take them out. In real football, the more
  you use a player, the more likely they are to get injured, so I incorporated
  that. Each player had an energy rating out of 20 – it diminished as he played,
  and the risk of injury increased. There had to be a reason to bring the lesser
  players in.” Toms also wanted to add long-term strategy and planning to the
  game, and this came in its most popular element: the transfer market. In the
  earliest versions of the game, you’d be offered the chance to sign one player
  a week, but that selection was randomised – you never knew who would be
  available. “Say you get a rating three midfielder come up and you need to
  strengthen your midfield: do you spend money on that or do you wait for a
  five-rated player who might not come for weeks? This generated pressure and
  fun.” The key problem he faced was memory. The expanded ZX81 had just 16k of
  it, which made some aspects tricky – including team names. “It was long before
  all the licensing issues came along,” he says. “My problem wasn’t: do I need
  to buy a licence to use Manchester United? It was that there wasn’t enough
  memory to store the name. Every team name had to fit within eight characters,
  so I chose teams with short names like Leeds – although I did put in Man U and
  Man C. The players were mostly well-known players of the time – but again,
  with short names – which is why Keegan is in there. It’s crazy how little
  memory there was.” Football Manager was first released in the early days of
  the gaming industry – copies were sold via mail order or at computer fairs.
  But by 1982, high street stores started to take notice of the emerging video
  game sector. “WH Smith got in contact and said, ‘We like your game, we want to
  stock it’, and they invited me down to London. They eventually placed an order
  for 2,000 units – the invoice for that order was more than I was earning in a
  year. About a month later, my girlfriend rang me at work and said: ‘Oh another
  order has come in from WH Smith, it’s 1,000 units.’ When I got home I realised
  her maths was pretty crap – it was 10,000.” Toms left his job at the Open
  University and set up his own company, Addictive Games. The subsequent Zx
  Spectrum and Commodore 64 versions of Football Manager came with an added
  component: match highlights, which showed basic graphical representations of
  key moments, such as goals and near-misses. “It was inspired by Match of the
  Day – they extract the most fun parts of the matches,” Toms says. “I purposely
  didn’t put a match timer onscreen, so you never knew where in the match the
  highlight was happening; you didn’t know how close you were to the end of the
  match, and whether there was time for another goal. This added to the tension
  – it was a critical part of the design. There’s also a slight pause between
  each highlight, and that also creates tension. It was very simple but it
  worked very well.” The game was a phenomenon, appearing on bestseller lists
  for years. My friends and I had hours of fun just editing the team and player
  names. We all remember it now. “I didn’t realise the full impact for years,”
  says Toms. “There was no internet at the time – although I did get a few
  letters saying: ‘I played your game for 22 hours straight.’ Or: ‘I failed my
  mock O-levels because of the game.’” He also knew that football pros were
  playing, including Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas and Spurs manager Bill
  Nicholson, as well as Harry Redknapp, who later had a role as a real-life
  mentor to a competition-winning Football Manager player in 2010. Toms wrote
  several other management games afterwards, including Software Star, a
  simulation of the games industry. But as the number of Football Manager
  conversions and updates increased, so did the stress. Finally, he sold the
  company and got out of games, returning to business coding while travelling
  the world. In 2003, Sports Interactive, the developer of the Championship
  Manager series, acquired the name Football Manager and rebranded its own game
  under that title – and the name lived on. But the game wasn’t quite over. Ten
  years ago, Toms got chatting to fans of his original game online and asked if
  anyone would be interested in a smartphone translation – Football Manager as
  they all remembered it, with the same basic visuals. The response was positive
  and, in 2016, he released Football Star* Manager on mobile. Recently, he
  upgraded it again and released a PC version. “People are enjoying it because
  it’s easy to play,” he says. “That’s inherent in my design philosophy – it
  must seem simple but have subtle depth or it won’t retain the interest. I’ve
  had people tell me they’ve played 500 seasons and they have £5bn in their bank
  account – the balance is clearly right because even with all that money
  they’re still enjoying playing. I’ve also had people who played the original
  buying Football Star* Manager for their kids to play.” Toms has clearly
  rediscovered the spark that brought the original Football Manager into the
  world, 40 years ago. He has long-term plans for Football Star* Manager, and
  perhaps Software Star, too. “I’ve still got loads to do,” he says. “I’ve got
  far more aims and ideas than I have time to implement at the moment. I’m not
  slowing down. I should do, but I’m not.”
