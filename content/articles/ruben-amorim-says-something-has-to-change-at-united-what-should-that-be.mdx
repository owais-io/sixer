  Ruben Amorim apologised to fans after Manchester United’s stunning defeat on
  penalties to fourth-tier Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and was clear that a line
  needed to be drawn. “I think this is a little bit the limit,” he said.
  “Something has to change. In this moment, we need to focus on the weekend and
  then we have time to think.” There are plenty of pointers. Amorim’s
  stubbornness Being cast-iron sure of your football vision is as vital for a
  head coach as being confident enough that the vision can be tweaked if results
  nosedive. Clearly Amorim has an undying faith in his 3-4-3 formation – but
  seemingly lacks the latter as he did not have the courage to watch the penalty
  shootout defeat at Grimsby, instead sitting hunched and feeble-looking in the
  dugout. Adjusting the stance regarding his football vision would be prudent.
  Wednesday’s Carabao Cup capitulation against Grimsby was the latest evidence
  of this. It all casts the Portuguese as Manchester United’s Russell Martin: a
  hubristic No 1 who believes that having an unshakeable blueprint shows he is a
  man of principle. The logic is easy to follow – and misguided. While players
  need to be sure that their manager believes in the plan for them to buy into
  it wholesale. The caveat, though, is this: if they follow it 100% and it still
  blows up so badly that a paltry 27 points from 29 Premier League games are
  accrued on top of being dumped out of the League Cup by League Two opposition
  you have to change. So far the man from Lisbon is not for turning. Address the
  game model United’s director of football, Jason Wilcox, is conscious that
  Amorim can be stubborn and while part of Wilcox’s role is to back the head
  coach, the time is ripe to discuss his manager’s beleaguered 3-4-3 and the
  chanceless play it produces. Erik ten Hag came under pressure from Dan
  Ashworth, Wilcox’s predecessor, to adjust his game model. When results did not
  turn around, the Dutchman was sacked. Wilcox has the power to instruct Amorim
  to field a different shape so why might he not? Wilcox, plus Omar Berrada, the
  chief executive, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the head of football, all hired the
  Portuguese on his 3-4-3 ticket, which makes it tricky for Amorim to be curtly
  informed there is a loss of faith in the system and the 40-year-old himself.
  Make Mainoo a starter In a terrible team performance at Blundell Park there
  were glimpses of what Kobbie Mainoo offers, especially in the first half. He
  padded about midfield, laying off balls, moving to make himself available, and
  was able to escape incoming traffic by turning in tight areas: the kind of No
  8 skillset Amorim’s United miss. Yet the coach’s current assessment is that a
  player who scored the 2024 FA Cup final-winning goal against Manchester City
  and was England’s European Championship breakout star that summer – starting
  the final – is not good enough for the starting XI. This has been Mainoo’s
  status since last Christmas, yet United’s results have not improved in his
  absence. While the head coach’s relations with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro
  Garnacho have broken down, he has no problem with Mainoo, so why not move
  Bruno Fernandes back to his regular No 10 slot and give Mainoo a chance as the
  fulcrum. Goalkeeper farrago Altay Bayindir’s error allowed Arsenal’s winner at
  Old Trafford in the 1-0 opening day loss and André Onana was culpable for both
  Grimsby goals. Clearly a new No 1 is needed. Quick. Amorim expects to sign
  Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp imminently but at 23 and with no senior
  Belgium caps he surely cannot be an instant solution to United’s goalkeeping
  problems. Instead, Bayindir may depart should Lammens arrive. If that happens
  a head coach who does not fancy Onana at all – he was a substitute at Fulham
  despite being fully fit – will have to pick the error-prone Cameroonian. MUTV
  grilling sums up United’s mess All club TV channels are Pravda-like, acting as
  a PR for the head coach and players. But cut to the aftermath of Blundell Park
  and MUTV tore up the policy up, as Diogo Dalot was given the fourth-estate
  treatment. The in-house station pointedly asked Dalot whether United should
  have the talent to beat a fourth-tier side. Dalot’s answer: “Exactly. Not just
  the quality, but obviously the minimum standards that you ask in every game,
  the approach to the game. “The best way for us to have respected Grimsby today
  was to come here and play 100%. I think that’s what we need to improve for the
  future. I don’t want to go through the same sentence time and again. We just
  have to show [that] and we just lost one opportunity today to show that we
  deserve to be here.”
