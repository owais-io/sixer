  Donald Trump administration officials fanned out on Sunday’s US political
  shows to defend the president’s policies after a bruising week of poor
  economic, trade and employment numbers that culminated with the firing of
  labor statistics chief Erika McEntarfer. The US trade representative, Jamieson
  Greer, said Trump had “real concerns” about the jobs numbers that extend
  beyond Friday’s report that showed the national economy added 73,000 jobs in
  July, far below expectations. Job growth numbers were revised down by 285,000
  for the two previous months as well. On CBS News’s Face the Nation, Greer
  defended Trump’s decision to fire McEntarfer, a respected statistician,
  saying: “You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are
  always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme
  ways.” He added: “The president is the president. He can choose who works in
  the executive branch.” But William Beach, who served as Trump’s commissioner
  of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in his first presidency, warned that
  McEntarfer’s dismissal would undermine confidence in the quality of US
  economic data. The BLS gave no reason for the revised data but noted that
  “monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and
  government agencies since the last published estimates and from the
  recalculation of seasonal factors”. “This is damaging,” Beach said on Sunday
  on CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t know that there’s any grounds at all for
  this firing. “And it really hurts the statistical system. It undermines
  credibility in BLS.” McEntarfer on Friday published a statement on social
  media reacting to her dismissal, calling it the “honor my life” to have served
  as BLS commissioner. She said the BLS employed “many dedicated civil servants
  tasked with measuring a vast and dynamic economy”. “It is vital and important
  work, and I thank them for their service to this nation,” McEntarfer’s
  statement on the Bluesky platform said. Uproar over McEntarfer’s firing has
  come as a series of new tariff rates are due to come into effect this month.
  While the president has predicted a golden age for the US economy, many
  economists warn that higher import tariffs could ultimately weaken American
  economic activity. On CBS, Greer said that Trump’s tariff rates were “pretty
  much set” and unlikely to be renegotiated before they come into effect. The
  first six months of Trump’s second terms have been characterized by a
  seesawing of tariff rate announcements that earned the president the moniker
  on Wall Street of Taco – “Trump always chickens out”. But last week he issued
  an executive order outlining tariff modifications for dozens of countries
  after he had twice delayed implementation. Yet Greer also said many of the
  tariff rates announced “are set rates pursuant to deals”. “Some of these deals
  are announced, some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit
  or surplus we may have with the country,” he said. On NBC’s Meet the Press,
  the national economic council (NEC) director, Kevin Hassett, said modified US
  tariff rates were now “more or less locked in, although there will have to be
  some dancing around the edges about exactly what we mean when we do this or
  that”. Asked if tariff rates could change again, he said, “I would rule it out
  because these are the final deals.” Hassett said that the president and the
  treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, are in the process of finding a replacement
  for Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman is coming to an end
  next year. Hassett demurred when asked if he would accept the position, saying
  Trump and Bessent were “going to go through a list of names. And I’m sure the
  president will pick the best available person. “We’ll have to see if he
  chooses me,” he added, noting that he’d been working with Trump for eight
  years as one of his closest economic advisers. “Of course, we’ve talked about
  the Federal Reserve,” he said. On Fox News Sunday, Hassett said he also
  supported McEntarfer’s dismissal. “I think what we need is a fresh set of eyes
  at the BLS, somebody who can clean this thing up,” he remarked. But former
  treasury secretary Larry Summers told ABC’s This Week that McEntarfer’s firing
  was “way beyond anything that Richard Nixon ever did”, alluding to the late
  former president who resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal. Summers said
  Trump’s claim that the poor job numbers were “phoney” and designed to make him
  look bad “is a preposterous charge”. “These numbers are put together by teams
  of literally hundreds of people following detailed procedures that are in
  manuals,” Summers said. “There’s no conceivable way that the head of the BLS
  could have manipulated this number. The numbers are in line with what we’re
  seeing from all kinds of private sector sources.” Summers placed McEntarfer’s
  firing, Trump’s pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, and the strong-arm
  tactics that the administration has aimed at universities, law firms and media
  institutions in the same bucket. “This is the stuff of democracies giving way
  to authoritarianism,” Summers said. “Firing statisticians goes with
  threatening the heads of newspapers. “It goes with launching assaults on
  universities. It goes with launching assaults on law firms that defend clients
  that the elected boss finds uncongenial. This is really scary stuff.”
