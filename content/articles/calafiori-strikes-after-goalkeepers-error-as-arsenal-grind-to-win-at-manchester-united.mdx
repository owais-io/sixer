  Blazing sunshine and a busy new marquee serving craft ale behind the Stretford
  End: Manchester United began in a shiny new world and finished in the gloom of
  another defeat. First look at Altay Bayindir’s howler that handed Riccardo
  Calafiori an easy header. But then zoom out and you see this: a crisis at No 1
  for United that features Ruben Amorim going all summer not fancying André
  Onana and still turning up for the season opener without a high-end
  replacement. Result: Bayindir’s ricket. The head coach defended preferring
  Bayindir to Tom Heaton when reminded how the Turk allowed a similar goal –
  straight in from a Son Heung-min corner – last season in the 4-3 Carabao Cup
  defeat at Spurs. He denied, too, dropping Onana as he had not “trained” enough
  after injury and stated contentment with his trio of keepers. The 40-year-old
  has to say this of course yet Onana and Bayindir have a record of goal-costing
  errors. Arsenal failed to fire throughout – Viktor Gyökeres’s 60-minute debut
  was a non-event – but they did not need to with United so dismal at both ends.
  Towards the close Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo tripped over Arsenal players in
  a hectic scramble to cancel out Calafiori’s strike: a snapshot of United’s
  chronic toothlessness. Moments later, a better Mbeumo headed effort drew a
  good save from David Raya. There were further goalmouth scrambles but no
  United player could stick the ball in the net. In a middling contest, Amorim’s
  team had to do what the visiting left‑back did – with this 13th-minute goal a
  disaster for United and a joy for him. Declan Rice arrowed a corner in from
  the left, a clownish Bayindir merely palmed the ball on and Calafiori nodded
  home a ball already heading in. “One‑nil to the Arsenal” came the ecstatic
  taunt from the faithful. At the time, United complained that Bayindir was
  caught in a melee. Afterwards, Bruno Fernandes said: “When you touch the
  goalkeeper and he can’t jump, that makes it difficult for Bayindir. We know in
  the Premier League they don’t give much. Even if they had a meeting with us
  saying that they will whistle more if players block and don’t look at the ball
  but it is more of [them] saying [this].” Just as suspect as the goalkeeping
  was the XI sent out that could be marked “curio”, with Amorim preferring
  Casemiro to Manuel Ugarte in midfield and Mason Mount the nominal No 9 (no
  squad place for Rasmus Højlund), though Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha started. The
  new boys began fast – Mbeumo barged over Martín Zubimendi (also on debut),
  Cunha ran in, howled for his twin-10 to pass, he did, but Arsenal escaped.
  Mikel Arteta, who issued a trademark moan at Mbeumo’s challenge, had to watch
  as Mbeumo again motored along his right corridor but the shot was a pea-roller
  into Raya’s hands. At this juncture, United were fast and furious, even when
  defending. From a Fernandes corner Arsenal broke and Mount hared back to help
  out. Then, after Calafiori’s winner, United were back in counterattack mode. A
  proposition of serial moments but none of the patterns Amorim (surely) craves.
  Patrick Dorgu hit a post. The livewire Cunha wriggled in a left zone and
  turned and forced a Raya reflex save. Zubimendi’s foul on Fernandes had the
  latter hitting the wall to the right of the area. A scintillating Cunha run
  took him from halfway through a thicket of opponents and clear but the effort
  was scuffed. Mbeumo’s cute layoff was followed by a 25‑yard Cunha shot
  straight at Raya. Yet without Bayindir’s howler Arteta would have had the
  harder half-time chat as his team were no smooth unit, tapping the ball about,
  manoeuvring those in red like Subbuteo pieces. Rice and Zubimendi exerted
  scant control in central areas and Gyökeres laboured and suffered from his
  teammates’ creation deficit. United, brighter in this department, saw Mount
  fluff their latest attempt, so Amorim had to do something – be patient (in
  hope) or make a change. He chose the latter. Diallo (another surprising
  exclusion) entered for the average Diogo Dalot and the Ivorian impressed – one
  more Amorim team selection puzzler. Benjamin Sesko, continually warming up,
  watched as Fernandes flipped in a dead-ball from the left corner flag and Raya
  rose and punched away – as Bayindir fatally failed to do. To boos Gyökeres was
  hooked on the hour for Kai Havertz. The derision came from spurned suitors
  after the Swede chose north London not south Manchester. But jeers became
  cheers as Sesko was given a 25-minute debut – for the anonymous Mount. Ugarte,
  too, was introduced, for Casemiro. Immediately, a tangle with Noni Madueke,
  another visiting substitute, was the midfield bite United lacked. Amorim’s men
  were lacking all over the park. A tight win for Arsenal. One more chastening
  day for the Portuguese’s project. Fernandes was left clutching straws. “I
  really liked the reaction of the fans at the end. That was more a sign of hope
  than what we did during the game.” Amorim was more pithy. “We need to win more
  than last season,” he said.
