  Hamlet by New York Circus Project review – a flashy, dreamy spin on
  Shakespeare
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  It wouldn’t be the Edinburgh fringe without at least one new spin on Hamlet.
  This spunky 60-minute version created by Sam Landa and Emma Owens combines a
  radically trimmed text with aerial acrobatics, tumbling and clowning.
  Sensitively delivering Shakespearean verse and executing sophisticated circus
  requires a niche skill-set; some lines fall flat but Landa and Danielle
  Diniz’s choreography often deepens a story limited to the personal not the
  political. The enterprise is executed with panache by a charismatic cast of
  10. Who’s there? A ghost in white, twisting and turning to the song Don’t Let
  Me Be Misunderstood, later returning to use an aerial pyramid. The show casts
  Old Hamlet (Arthur Morel Van Hyfte) and Hamlet (Maddox Morfit-Tighe) at a
  similar age, which movingly emphasises how they see themselves in each other,
  although the ghost’s recurrent “remember me” voiceover sounds more horror
  movie than tragedy. Light circus skills relay the romance between Hamlet and
  Ophelia (Maleah Rendon) as acrobats deliver the love letter that leaves her
  literally head over heels. Ophelia and Laertes (Eduardo Grillo) tumble like
  scrapping siblings, although as the show progresses the circus elements are
  stop-start rather than continuous. Hamlet’s letter is not read in its entirety
  by Polonius (Dylan Ingwersen) but scrawled across the set and then up
  Ophelia’s body in chalk by the prince, underlining apparent madness. Both
  characters’ descent is propelled by Kim Petras’s There Will Be Blood (more
  shades of horror) and “To be or not to be” is looped, echoing its unresolvable
  arguments, as cartwheels fill the stage. Hamlet’s moves are as quicksilver as
  his thinking. It’s full pelt, so when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern pull up,
  the sense of light mischief shared by Caroline Bertorello and Kaisha
  Dessalines Wright respectively is all the more appreciated. In matching vests
  and shorts, with a script deviating from Shakespeare, they’re not so much a
  deceptive duo as pals with a more-than-friends frisson. The play within the
  play is cod Bob Fosse but in Landa’s production the use of music and poppy,
  cocksure aesthetic are not unlike Baz Luhrmann’s take on Romeo and Juliet.
  This venue’s past life as a church is also cannily deployed when a curtain is
  pulled to reveal ecclesiastical architecture during Claudius’s confession. The
  emotional impact often needs heightening but Ophelia’s death, in a
  water-filled glass box, becomes a transfixing sequence accompanied by Weyes
  Blood’s track Movies. Her body contorts as if twisted by the men who have
  wielded control of her. It leaves Gertrude’s elegy oddly redundant. Flashy,
  dreamy, occasionally barmy, it’s certainly seldom boring – an eye-popping
  primer for students with appeal for Hamlet stans, too. • At Assembly Roxy,
