  A Hong Kong infrastructure company is reportedly a leading contender to buy
  Thames Water if the heavily indebted company collapses in coming weeks. CKI,
  which invests in power and other utility companies in the UK, is among those
  lining up to acquire the water and sewerage supplier if it enters a special
  administration regime (SAR), according to the Times. It has reportedly said it
  would be prepared to operate under tougher penalties for environmental
  breaches than Thames’s class A creditors, who have put together their own
  purchase bid. The creditor group has said the company cannot afford to operate
  with an expected £1bn of fines coming down the track, which are levied by the
  regulator for breaches such as illegally dumping sewage. In May, Thames was
  hit with a record £104m fine over environmental breaches involving sewage
  spills. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, has in recent months stepped up
  preparations for the possibility of putting Thames into SAR – effectively a
  form of temporary nationalisation. On Tuesday the government confirmed it had
  appointed FTI Consulting to make contingency plans for a potential collapse.
  The appointment indicates that FTI is the first choice to act as administrator
  if the government enacted an SAR, although a court would ultimately approve
  such a step. Campaigners have said Reed should not sell off Thames Water
  immediately after an SAR, instead suggesting he should consider nationalising
  the utility. River Action wrote to him on Wednesday warning that writing off
  the company’s debts only to sell it to another private foreign investor would
  be a “profound betrayal of the public”. The group’s head of campaigns, Amy
  Fairman, said: “This crisis is a chance to rebuild [Thames] for public
  benefit, not private profit. Labour campaigned hard during last year’s
  election on promises to get a grip on the water crisis and act tough on
  failing water companies. This is a chance to chart a new course, not repeat
  the mistakes of the past by selling to overseas buyers eyeing a bargain.”
  Thames, which supplies 16 million customers in London and south-east England,
  has been racing to pull together a deal to avoid financial collapse. The
  government has been trying to avoid such an outcome, with the Treasury
  threatening that a potential £4bn bill from the SAR could be forced on to
  Reed’s department. This process would ensure that the taps stayed on for
  customers but would heap immediate costs on to the government. Thames faced
  embarrassment earlier this year when its preferred bidder, KKR, pulled out of
  a deal at the last minute. Now, its class A creditors, who hold the bulk of
  the company’s senior debt, are in talks with the regulator for England and
  Wales, Ofwat, about a deal to inject capital into the company, which has
  £17.7bn of net debts and regulatory gearing of 84.4%. CKI has previously
  expressed interest in buying the company and wrote to Sir Adrian Montague, the
  chair of Thames, when KKR pulled out earlier this summer. The private
  infrastructure giant had previously been eliminated from the process despite
  tabling a multibillion-pound proposal, as Thames chose KKR as a preferred
  bidder and entered exclusive talks with the company. Ministers are said to be
  reassured by CKI’s extensive experience in operating assets at scale, such as
  UK Power Networks, but some MPs have raised concerns about the Beijing links
  of the network. The Chinese government’s sovereign wealth fund owns 9% of
  Thames Water. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith previously said
  on social media that a CKI acquisition “should be avoided at all costs”. A
  Thames Water spokesperson said: “Our focus remains on a holistic and
  fundamental recapitalisation, delivering a market-led solution which includes
  targeting investment grade credit ratings and returning the company to a
  stable financial foundation. Constructive discussions with our many
  stakeholders continue.” CKI was approached for comment.
