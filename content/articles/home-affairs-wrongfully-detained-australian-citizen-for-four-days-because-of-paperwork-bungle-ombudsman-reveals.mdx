  Home affairs wrongfully detained an Australian citizen because of an
  administration error, the commonwealth ombudsman has revealed, while another
  person with a valid visa was incorrectly held for 18 months in immigration
  detention. The Australian citizen, known as Mx C, was born in Australia to New
  Zealand parents in 1989, automatically granting them citizenship on their 10th
  birthday – but it was not recorded in departmental records. Mx C was
  incorrectly granted a special category visa in 2010 despite being a citizen,
  and after an unrelated term of imprisonment in February 2023, home affairs
  cancelled that visa. Mx C quickly emailed the department a copy of their
  Australian birth certificate, advising they were a citizen, but home affairs
  upheld the cancellation and they were wrongly detained for four days. After
  months of legal wrangling and a move from criminal custody to immigration
  detention, a new assessment was eventually made, Mx C’s citizenship was
  confirmed in September 2023, and they were released. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email Another error saw a person with a valid visa detained for a year and a
  half, leading the ombudsman to note that the department is still making
  mistakes 20 years after Cornelia Rau’s detention. The ombudsman’s report,
  released on Wednesday, also found home affairs wrongfully detained 11 people
  last financial year due to mistakes that could have been avoided, amid a
  culture of “act first, check later”. Another case, known as Mx A, arrived in
  Australia in April 1987, and their visa expired in October of the same year.
  Mx A was eventually detained in February 2012, then granted a bridging visa in
  August, and then a tourist visa in September. The tourist visa was left open
  ended, with no expiration date, by mistake. Mx A went to prison in 2017, so
  the department cancelled their bridging visa and they were re-detained on
  their release from custody in February 2022. In August 2023, the department
  realised the tourist visa from 2012 was still valid, and Mx A was released.
  “Wrongfully depriving a person of their liberty is serious,” ombudsman Iain
  Anderson said. “Home affairs needs to do more to take accountability and
  acknowledge the human impact of their actions. Since we began monitoring the
  issue in 2005, we have observed similar types of errors causing people to be
  wrongfully detained. “Home affairs had also not improved the way it addresses
  its mistakes with the individuals it has wrongfully detained, not offering any
  form of redress, formal apology, or financial compensation.” As well as Rau,
  the report mentions the case of Vivian Alvarez Solon, an Australian citizen
  wrongly deported by the department in 2001. In 2005, then prime minister John
  Howard and then immigration minister Amanda Vanstone issued formal apologies
  to Rau and Alvarez as “the victims of mistakes by the department”.
  Communication breakdowns, outdated data, administration errors, and “failure
  to take personal responsibility for decision making and erroneous assumptions”
  were to blame, as well as the department not properly notifying people of visa
  cancellations or refusals and the “significant challenges” of complicated
  legal situations. Of the 11 detentions, 10 “could have been avoided if
  existing policies and procedures were properly followed”. Six were worked out
  within three business days. The report notes there appears to be a culture of
  “act first, check later”. “While our office acknowledges that the department
  has taken steps to improve officers’ knowledge about fundamental citizenship
  issues this reporting period, it is concerning that almost two decades after
  the first occurrence, we are seeing the same errors that were identified in
  previous reports,” the report states. It added it was not fair to put the onus
  to rectify the situation on individuals who were likely unaware of their
  rights. “Being wrongfully detained can be an isolating and dehumanising
  experience, and cause significant emotional distress and psychological
  trauma,” it states. “There is also evidence regarding the severe harms caused
  by immigration detention more broadly, including the re-traumatisation of
  torture victims and exacerbation of existing physical and mental health
  issues.” The report uses the word “wrongfully” rather than “unlawfully”
  because the officers may have held reasonable suspicions at the time.
  “However, in every case the detention was wrong because the department later
  found that this suspicion was incorrect,” the report found. The number of
  people wrongfully detained has decreased overall, after a peak of 40 people in
  2017-18. The ombudsman’s recommendations include additional checks before
  detaining people, including supervisor signoff for planned detention
  operations; a formal apology, acknowledgment of wrongdoing, and information
  about compensation; and a factsheet in a person’s language about their rights
  to compensation. The department has accepted all three recommendations. The
  home affairs secretary, Stephanie Foster, told the ombudsman that each
  recommendation was “afforded careful consideration” and accepted. She also
  disagreed with the view that there was a culture of “act first, check later”
  and said that checks are undertaken, interviews are conducted, and records are
  written to support an officer’s conclusion that person is an unlawful
  non-citizen.
