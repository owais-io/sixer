  Halfway through the NWSL’s 13th regular season, the league reported TV ratings
  were trending down. But August has already shown glimmers of recovery and
  context adds important caveats to that downward slope. As first reported by
  Sports Business Journal, when the league took a month-long break midway
  through the year in July, ratings were down by 8% across their multiplatform
  media partnership. That partnership, which is now in its second year, was
  signed in November 2023 with CBS, ESPN, ION (Scripps Sports) and Prime Video
  for a deal worth $240m – a huge increase from their previous one-party
  partnership with CBS worth $4.5m. In its first year, the league saw a big
  uptick in viewing numbers as matches proliferated across a variety of outlets,
  reaching a wider audience. At the close of the 2024 season, Nielsen measured a
  five-fold increase in total viewership (18.7 million) across all platforms
  from the previous year. The championship match became the most-watched game in
  league history, peaking at 1.1 million viewers and averaging 967,000 on CBS.
  That match – in which a record-breaking Orlando Pride squad defeated the
  Washington Spirit, marking the Brazilian veteran Marta’s first NWSL
  championship on a field packed with recent Olympians – clocked an 18% increase
  in average viewers from 2023. A variety of factors may have been behind this
  year’s midseason dip, with the league pointing towards missing stars as one
  potential impact. As an example, all three members of the USWNT’s forward
  line, Sophia Wilson (née Smith), Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman – who
  combined for 10 goals last year at the Olympics – have been absent for most of
  the 2025 season as the first two are on maternity leave and Rodman in rehab
  for chronic back pain. Rodman has since returned to the field for the Spirit
  and there are hopes her star power may aid end-of-season momentum. Notably,
  NWSL in 2025 is a league with an exciting array of international stars who
  represented their countries in record numbers at a spate of international
  tournaments in July. Their return to the league after big performances at the
  Women’s European Championship, the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, and the Copa
  América Femenina may also help to boost interest. For example, ION’s numbers
  had been trending down in 2025 (as opposed to ESPN, which has trended up so
  far this season) but an early look at ION viewing numbers for August show a
  healthy increase, with an average of 162,750 viewers through the first four
  weekends of August. ION’s Saturday allotment of games features a weekly slate
  of back-to-back matchups, with the 16 August duo clocking an average audience
  of 188,000 – the highest of the first four weeks in that month. Among that
  evening’s games was a California confrontation between San Diego Wave and Bay
  FC, which featured newly returned international players on either side,
  including the Zambia forward Racheal Kundananji. San Diego Wave featured a few
  Euro 2025 quarter-finalists in the Sweden defender Hanna Lundkvist and the
  France forward Delphine Cascarino. With thhe Mexican forward Lizbeth Ovalle
  poised to join Orlando Pride for the latter half of the season after breaking
  the women’s transfer record yet again in 2025, and the Spanish striker Esther
  González (who finished top scorer at Euro 2025) going toe-to-toe each weekend
  with the Malawi forward Temwa Chawinga in a closely contested Golden Boot
  race, observers can expect exciting international stars outside of the USWNT
  to continue driving eyeballs the closer the league gets to the playoffs. With
  viewing numbers yet to be confirmed for all of August’s matches, there have
  still been a few curveballs affecting plans. That includes a more than
  three-hour weather delay to a highly touted televised match between Kansas
  City Current and Orlando Pride (which was eventually played amid scorching
  Missouri heat, with the Orlando Pride top scorer Barbra Banda departing the
  pitch with a season-ending injury). But the league has its eye on
  end-of-season games that seem likely to boost overall numbers for the 2025
  season. Most immediately, that includes Alex Morgan’s retirement ceremony
  match airing this weekend on ESPN. Asked for comment, the league maintained
  confidence that viewing numbers would grow as we near the final weeks of the
  season. As Jennifer Levine, vice-president of public relations and
  communications at the NWSL, said: “As the race to the shield intensifies and
  playoffs get closer, we anticipate that even more viewers will want to tune in
  to the competition.” Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about
