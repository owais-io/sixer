  It was the model Cara Delevingne who said you can never be sad in a ball pit –
  so why wouldn’t you install one in a room you don’t quite know what to do
  with? A large Victorian house for sale in Southport has gone viral not because
  it is, as estate agents say, a “hidden gem” and an “oasis of calm” with
  viewing “absolutely essential” but because just off the master bedroom is a
  vestibule that is “presently adorned by numerous plastic balls to create a
  ball pool all of your very own”. There are 11,300 plastic balls in the pit and
  it is enjoyed by children and adults alike, according to Julie Williams, an IT
  consultant who is selling the house. “It was a birthday present to myself,”
  Williams said. “Instead of a weekend away I built a ball pit. It is so
  relaxing.” Williams was inspired by Delevingne, who installed a ball pit in
  her former Los Angeles home, described by Architectural Digest as “St-Tropez
  meets Coney Island meets Cotswolds cottage meets Monte Carlo meets butch
  leather bar”. Delevingne said the house reflected her changing characters and
  moods: it had a costume room for dress-up parties, a poker tent, trampolines,
  a secret “vagina tunnel”, a party bunker with a mirrored ceiling, a David
  Bowie memorial bathroom and the ball pit. “If I’m having a bad day, I just hop
  in the ball pit,” she said. “You can’t really cry in a ball pit.” Williams
  said she had thought about creating a bathroom in what she called her “project
  room” – an odd first-floor vestibule off the master bedroom with its own small
  staircase. “My friend had seen a video on YouTube of Carla Delevingne where
  she says something along the lines of you can never be unhappy or sad in a
  ball pit.” So Williams went for it, buying 11,300 plastic balls in March 2024
  and creating the ball pit herself. It was inaugurated with Williams and
  friends drinking half bottles of rosé champagne in it. “It’s great. This is
  the new relaxation method for mums and dads. Get a ball pit and hide away from
  the children.” Williams’ seven-bedroom house in leafy Birkdale village is on
  the market for £799,995, and if new buyers wanted to keep the pit, plus balls,
  then they could, Williams said. The house went viral after featuring on a
  social media account called Housing Horrors, which shines a light on some of
  the weirder and more wonderful quirks of houses for sale or rent in the UK.
