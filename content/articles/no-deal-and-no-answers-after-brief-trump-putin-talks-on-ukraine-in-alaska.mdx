  Donald Trump left more questions than answers on Friday as he claimed “great
  progress” in his high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin but admitted that no
  deal had been reached to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. The US president also
  suggested that it was now up to Volodymyr Zelenskyy to “get it done” and that
  a meeting would be set up between the Ukrainian president and Putin, which
  Trump might attend. “We had an extremely productive meeting and many points
  were agreed to,” Trump said at a joint press conference in Anchorage, Alaska.
  “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One
  is probably the most significant but we have a very good chance of getting
  there.” He cautioned: “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.” The two leaders
  lavished praise on each other – Putin endorsed Trump’s view that the war would
  never have started if Trump had won the 2020 election – but offered no details
  of the nearly three-hour meeting and took no questions from reporters. Putin,
  speaking through an interpreter, described Trump’s efforts on Ukraine as
  “precious” and suggested the two leaders had hammered out “an understanding”.
  He urged Europe to “not throw a wrench in the works” and to “not use backroom
  dealings” to torpedo it. Putin said that he agreed that Ukraine’s security
  must be guaranteed – but also said that the “root causes” of the conflict must
  be resolved. Those “root causes” have previously included his demands for
  Ukraine’s formal renunciation of Nato membership as well as its
  “denazification” – a vague set of demands that in practice amount to the
  removal of Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy and European allies may have been alarmed by
  Trump’s body language and deferential attitude toward Putin, whom he welcomed
  warmly at an Alaska air force base and allowed to ride in the presidential
  limousine known as “the beast”. Trump told reporters: “We really made some
  great progress today. I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with President
  Putin – with Vladimir.” As the press conference ended Putin suggested their
  next meeting might take place in Moscow, and dozens of reporters shouted
  questions in vain. The US president, who can typically never resist a
  free-wheeling press conference, left the stage without answering any of them.
  However, he did elaborate in an interview with Sean Hannity, a host on the
  conservative Fox News network, suggesting that the ball was in Ukraine’s
  court. “Now it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done and I would
  also say the European nations – they have to get involved a little bit.
  “They’re going to set up a meeting now between President Zelenskyy and
  President Putin and myself I guess. I didn’t ask about it. Not that I want to
  be there but I want to make sure it gets done and we have a pretty good chance
  of getting it done.” The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said Trump
  had “rolled out the red carpet” for an “authoritarian thug … instead of
  standing with our allies”. “While we wait for critical details of what was
  discussed – on first take it appears Trump handed Putin legitimacy, a global
  stage, zero accountability, and got nothing in return. Our fear is that this
  wasn’t diplomacy – it was just theatre.” Ken Martin, the chair of the
  Democratic National Committee, said: “Donald Trump has been cozying up to
  Vladimir Putin for years, and this meeting underscored the depth of his sick
  obsession with the Russian dictator and accused war criminal.” He added:
  “Trump has been clear that his foreign policy agenda is letting Russia ‘do
  whatever the hell they want’ – no matter how disastrous for the US and our
  allies – and when put to the test, Trump embarrassed the United States by
  folding like a cheap suit.” The two leaders disembarked their planes at
  11.08am local time at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era air
  force base on the outskirts of Anchorage, Alaska. The friendly, tactile body
  language that followed offered a stark contrast to Trump’s shakedown of
  Zelenskyy, in the Oval Office in February. Trump and Putin walked down red
  carpets that had been rolled up to their respective planes and met where the
  carpets came to a T, with Trump arriving first and clapping as Putin
  approached. The men shared a warm handshake and what appeared to be some
  lighthearted banter. Trump gave Putin a friendly tap on the arm. Putin grinned
  and pointed skyward while their hands were still clasped. The pair walked
  together towards a platform bearing a sign that read Alaska 2025 as B-2s and
  F-22s – military aircraft designed to oppose Russia during the cold war – flew
  over to mark the moment. Trump and Putin stood looking towards the media but
  did not respond to shouted questions including: “President Putin, will you
  stop killing civilians?” The Russian president, who is wanted by the
  international criminal court, appeared to shrug. Putin then joined Trump in
  the presidential limousine – a rare privilege for allies and adversaries alike
  – and could be seen laughing with glee. The men then sat together in a
  conference room with their respective delegations, seated to the side in front
  of a blue backdrop that had the words “Pursuing Peace” printed on it several
  times. Trump was joined by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and special
  envoy Steve Witkoff, and Putin by his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and
  foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov. The White House press secretary,
  Karoline Leavitt, said the previously planned one-on-one meeting between Trump
  and Putin would be a three-on-three negotiation. That marked a shift from a
  2018 meeting in Helsinki, when Trump and Putin first met privately just with
  their interpreters for two hours. In recent weeks Trump had expressed
  frustration with Putin over the war but a promise of new US sanctions gave way
  to a face-to-face meeting. Critics warned that, by bringing Putin on to US
  soil for the first time in a decade, the president has given him the
  legitimacy he craves after he became a global pariah after his invasion of
  Ukraine in 2022. European allies fear that the notoriously mercurial Trump
  might sell out Ukraine by essentially freezing the conflict with Russia and
  recognising – if only informally – Russian control over one-fifth of Ukraine.
  Trump sought to assuage such concerns as he boarded Air Force One on the way
  to Alaska, saying he would let Ukraine decide on any possible territorial
  swaps. “I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine, I’m here to get them at a
  table,” he said. Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told
  reporters: “I want to see a ceasefire rapidly … I’m not going to be happy if
  it’s not today … I want the killing to stop.” On his way to Alaska, Trump sat
  for an interview on Air Force One with Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier. In a
  clip posted online, he said he thought the meeting would “work out very well –
  and if it doesn’t, I’m going to head back home real fast.” “I would walk,
  yeah,” he added, after a follow-up question. Any success is far from assured
  because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin
  has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in eastern
  arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine’s mobilisation efforts, which are
  conditions rejected by Kyiv and its western allies. Trump previously
  characterised the summit as “really a feel-out meeting”. But he has also
  warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin does not agree to end
  the war. Trump said earlier in the week there was a 25% chance that the summit
  would fail but also floated the idea that, if the meeting succeeds, he could
  bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting.
