  Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. The Washington DC national guard will
  begin deploying on the city’s streets, a day after Donald Trump ordered their
  arrival and took control of the city’s police force, calling Washington DC a
  “lawless” city despite official crime statistics saying otherwise. Defence
  officials said a small number of the roughly 800 guard members planned for the
  mission had already been mobilised, with more expected to arrive in the coming
  days. About 850 officers and agents took part in a “massive law enforcement
  surge” across Washington DC on Monday night and made nearly two dozen arrests,
  the White House has said. The violent crime rate in the city is at a 30-year
  low. Top news New Zealand woman and six-year-old son detained for three weeks
