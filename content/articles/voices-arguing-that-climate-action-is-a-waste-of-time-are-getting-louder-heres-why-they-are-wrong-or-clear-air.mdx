  There is something of a reality check under way on the response to the climate
  crisis. It’s no secret that countries and corporations are far from living up
  to the goals set by international leaders at the landmark 2015 Paris
  agreement. Unless there is a significant course correction, the ramifications
  will be far-reaching and often destructive. The second coming of Donald Trump
  and growing global instability has made a top-down injection of urgency at the
  pace needed harder to imagine. Optimism is harder to come by. But that doesn’t
  mean nothing is happening. It’s worth pointing this out because a narrative
  has started to take hold that renewable energy and other clean solutions have
  made little to no headway in displacing fossil fuels, and therefore are
  pointless. Fuelled by Tony Blair and the former US government adviser Daniel
  Yergin, and embraced by the fossil fuel industry and its lapdogs in the
  commentariat, it is used to attack zero emissions targets as a fool’s dream.
  In Australia, it is part of the backdrop as the Albanese government is lobbied
  over whether to set an ambitious emissions reduction target for 2035. The
  reality, though, is more complicated. Here are some things worth considering
  if you hear climate action is pointless. Clean energy is coming for fossil
  fuels One line that has gained some traction this year is that the proportion
  of global energy supply from fossil fuels has barely moved over the past 35
  years. The claim – bubbling away in the The Australian, on Sky News and on
  social media – goes that dirty fuels provided 85% of energy in 1990, and still
  provide 80% today. So much for progress, right? But the Bloomberg New Energy
  Finance founder and self-declared conservative Michael Liebreich points out
  that this ignores an important factor. The percentages referred to by fossil
  fuel advocates are for primary energy – that is, raw coal, crude oil, gas,
  wood, sun or wind. They do not refer to useful energy – energy that has been
  converted into a transportable form, such as electricity or refined petroleum,
  delivered to a consumer and then used to light their house or move their car.
  This useful energy is the more relevant measure. And the process of processing
  raw fossil fuels into useful energy is, in many cases, not particular
  efficient. More energy is lost in generating at a remote coal-fired power
  plant and transmitting it to a home than if solar, wind or hydro was used.
  Petrol cars require much more energy to travel a kilometre than an electric
  vehicle does. If we acknowledge this and consider useful energy alone,
  Liebreich says the amount of energy provided by fossil fuels is not 80%, but
  about 68%. This is obviously still too high. But it won’t stay at this level.
  Despite all the talk of new coal plants still being built, they are playing in
  the margins. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that solar and
  wind will meet more than 90% of the global increase in electricity demand this
  year. Global generation from solar and wind energy is expected to increase by
  about 25%, from 4,000 terawatt-hours to more than 5,000. Next year it is
  expected to jump another 20%, past 6,000TWh. The IEA projects that global
  renewable energy output – including solar, wind and hydro – will surpass coal
  output in either 2025 or 2026. For the first time in a century, the share of
  electricity coming from coal will have fallen to less than 33%. Solar and wind
  will together be nearly 20% – up from 4% a decade ago. A key question is if
  this growth in renewable energy will eventually reduce global fossil fuel use
  – as is necessary – or mostly just meet growing energy demand. Liebreich
  argues compellingly that fossil fuel use is set to fall. Using a simple model,
  he suggests it is likely to start falling in the 2040s and could be squeezed
  out of the system by about 2065. That is not near fast enough to deliver the
  trajectory scientists say is needed to limit global heating since
  pre-industrialisation to 1.5C. But it is a well argued rejection of claims
  that a global transition isn’t possible. China? It’s moving With a population
  of 1.4 billion and having taken on a huge proportion of the world’s
  manufacturing, China is easily the world’s biggest direct national climate
  polluter, pumping out more than twice as much CO2 as the second-placed US. Its
  story is mixed, as always. But the data show it is changing. An analysis for
  Carbon Brief by China experts Qi Qin and Lauri Myllyvirta found that coal’s
  share of the country’s power generation fell from 73% in 2016 to 51% in June
  this year. This happened as it continued to build new coal plants for a simple
  reason – it doesn’t run them at anything like capacity. A significant moment
  came earlier this year when China’s national emissions fell for the first
  time, dropping 1% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Beijing
  needs to do much more if it is to meet its commitment under the Paris deal.
  Its next five-year plan for economic development, due this year, will be
  crucial. Dirty car sales are down According to Our World in Data, global sales
  of internal combustion engine cars – which run solely on petrol or diesel –
  peaked in 2016 at 80.47m. Electric and plug-in hybrid car sales in that year
  were just 780,000. Last year, sales of dirty cars were 62.05m, a 23% fall.
  Electric and plug-in hybrid car sales had increased to 17.5m. Put another way,
  nearly a decade ago only one in every 100 cars sold across the globe was
  electric. Now it is more than one in five. Elon Musk’s extraordinary self-own
  in damaging Tesla’s reputation may dent the pace of growth but it won’t stop
  it. China has little time or need for Teslas and is home to more than 60% of
  global EV sales. Still a mountain to climb None of this is to understate the
  scale of the problem. This column has reported before on the big step-up in
  global heating since June 2023. Averaged across the globe, every day in 2024
  was at least 1.25C hotter than preindustrial levels, and three-quarters were
  1.5C hotter. Extreme weather events are becoming more damaging. Feedback loops
  (melting permaforst and huge wildfires) are releasing large additional amounts
  of CO2, accelerating the problem. Governments have barely started to
  acknowledge the expected increase in economic, societal and environmental
  costs that will hit productivity – the current focus of the Australian
  political class – and so much else. It’s hard to overstate how much there is
  to be done. But don’t believe self-interested arguments that action is
  impossible, or will be for nothing.
