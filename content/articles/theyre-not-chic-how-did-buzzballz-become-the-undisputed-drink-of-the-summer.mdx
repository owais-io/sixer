  When Merrilee Kick invented BuzzBallz in 2009, she was a 47-year-old teacher
  from Texas who needed to make some money fast. “I was about to get a divorce
  and was terrified of becoming homeless,” she says. “I was a high-school
  teacher not making enough money to survive, much less put two sons through
  college.” She had the opportunity to do an MBA through a teacher-enrichment
  programme, and came up with the idea for BuzzBallz one hot afternoon while
  marking homework. “I chose booze because it thrives in good times, and thrives
  even more in bad times,” she says. Kick decided to make a cocktail that came
  in a plastic container rather than glass that could break, and was inspired by
  the shape of a snow globe she had brought back from Sweden. Finding the funds
  to manufacture her product proved challenging. She was turned down for
  business loans by every bank in Dallas, until one accepted the cows from her
  mum’s ranch and her old car as collateral. Since then, BuzzBallz has grown to
  become the US’s biggest-selling single-serve premixed cocktail, and the
  fastest-growing ready-to-drink brand in terms of sales volume in the UK. In
  2022, the company was bought by Sazerac in an estimated $500m deal, which made
  Kick the 89th-richest self-made woman in the US. In January 2025, Kick and her
  family stepped back from running the company – now valued at more than $1bn.
  BuzzBallz arrived in the UK in 2022, and in the past year sales have boomed.
  In one day in London, I spoke to students, lawyers and a group of
  festivalgoers, all swigging the vividly coloured drinks. You may have seen the
  packaging – bright, round, gaudy – on shelves in corner shops and
  supermarkets, clutched at house parties or spilling out of the bins in your
  local park. “The buzz has been largely driven by organic discovery, primarily
  in independent retailers and via word of mouth on social media,” says Jake
  Wenz, the CEO of Sazerac. “It has been incredible to watch BuzzBallz become a
  cult favourite among consumers in the UK, specifically gen Z.” And it’s not
  just BuzzBallz that are booming in popularity with this age group. A survey
  showed that in March 2025, 76% of UK gen Z consumers had drunk alcohol in the
  last six months, up from 66% in 2023. Strawberry ‘Rita, Tequila ‘Rita and
  Chili Mango are Britain’s favourite flavours, according to Wenz. My nearest
  off-licence started selling them four months ago, and the shopkeeper tells me
  that young people can’t get enough of them. “It’s surreal,” says Kick. “What
  started as a wild idea has become a global party-starter.” “People my age are
  either buying a home and getting married,” says Freya McCann, 29, who works in
  sales in Edinburgh, “or they’re saying: ‘Let’s get some BuzzBallz and have a
  good time.’” McCann recently tried her first BuzzBallz, a Strawberry ‘Rita, at
  a friend’s party and now loves them. She thinks they’ve become popular in the
  UK because “you can get them at a corner shop, or before you get on the
  train”. They’re convenient, she says, “but they’re also quite silly”. For
  McCann, there’s something nostalgic about the drink, reminding her of school
  discos. “They used to sell these little drinks and you’d feel so hyper.” With
  about five teaspoons of sugar in each BuzzBallz, not far off the maximum daily
  recommendation for a woman, it’s no wonder. Like everything that was all the
  rage in the 90s and early 00s – from low-rise jeans to thin eyebrows –
  premixed drinks and alcopops are making a return. After a 10-year hiatus,
  Reef, the vodka, orange and passion fruit drink, was relaunched in 2024.
  Bacardi Breezer, also discontinued a decade ago, made a return this summer. In
  June, Smirnoff Ice launched a new advertising campaign across 20 countries.
  Nik Jhangiani, the interim chief executive of the drinks company Diageo, which
  makes Smirnoff Ice, told the Telegraph this month that it now has a “huge
  opportunity” to win over gen Z. In the mid-90s, when alcopops first came on
  the market, critics said they were being deliberately marketed to teenagers
  who were below the legal drinking age. “The thing that really bothered people
  about alcopops was that they are so palatable,” says Andrew Misell, a director
  at Alcohol Change UK. “We know from looking at statements from some of the
  drink companies that they were aware that if you want to sell more alcohol,
  you need to appeal to people who don’t like traditionally bitter or sharp
  drinks,” such as wine or beer. In 1996, the government slapped a 40% tax on
  alcopops and some supermarkets pulled them from their shelves. TV adverts for
  WKD and Smirnoff Ice were banned for encouraging under-18s to drink. By 2013,
  the ready-to-drink sector, which at its peak in 2005 was worth £1bn, had
  shrunk by half. Misell doesn’t think there’s anything especially wrong with
  alcopops or premixed cocktails making a return: “They don’t have any sort of
  extra-dangerous ingredients in them; they don’t tend to be particularly strong
  alcoholically.” But, he says, they are “easy to drink a lot of and they may
  appeal to younger drinkers who have a sweet palate”. Nick Lonergan, a
  29-year-old Australian who moved to London two years ago and works in customer
  relations for a fashion brand, had his first taste of BuzzBallz at a house
  party four months ago. “I had a sip and then I ran down to the store and
  bought about five of them,” he says. He likes the fact that they are easy to
  fit in a bag, which makes them “the perfect drink for a party”. Florence
  Langford, a 30-year-old Italian-Scottish marketing executive living in
  Manchester, thinks they’re perfect before a night out or at a festival.
  “They’re not chic,” she says. “But they are that drink of the summer.” The
  appeal for her is the packaging, which is fun, trashy and toxic-looking. “I
  probably just go for the most obnoxious colour over the taste, if I’m honest,”
  she says. There are two types of consumers for these kinds of drinks, says
  Matthew Bulcroft, the marketing director of Global Brands, which owns Hooch
  and Reef: “The nostalgia-chasers – the over-30s who either remember it from
  their parents drinking it or actually consuming it themselves.” They make up
  about 65% of Hooch’s market. The rest are finding the drink for the first
  time: “Either because the 90s and 00s are cool again, or just because they
  want an easy drink that is nice and refreshing and won’t get them too drunk,”
  says Bulcroft. Since 2022, the consumption of alcohol-free drinks has risen,
  with Mintel revealing that 41% of UK adults have drunk low- or no-alcohol
  beer, wine, cider, spirits or cocktails in the past three months. The
  manufacturers of drinks such as Hooch and Reef have responded by creating
  drinks that are lower in alcohol: once about 6% ABV, they are now 3.4%. Misell
  says that while there is a cohort of under-25s who don’t drink at all, that
  “doesn’t mean that the rest of the under-25s are problem-free when it comes to
  alcohol”. That could explain the popularity of BuzzBallz with gen Z. “They’re
  generally having one or two as a precursor to a night out, or it’s an
  indulgent treat for the train,” says Bulcroft. Gen Z and millennials rate the
  cost of living as their top concern, with 52% of both generations reporting
  that they live from one payday to the next. According to a 2025 survey by
  Deloitte, many young people will be looking for more cost-effective ways of
  socialising. Since the beginning of 2020, more than 2,000 pubs have closed in
  England and Wales, in part due to rising costs and declining consumer
  spending. BuzzBallz cost from £2.99 in Aldi, which started stocking them this
  May, to £4.99. At 13.5% ABV, they are certainly not low alcohol. Felicity
  Dunstan, who is finishing off a Choc Tease with her friends Carlo-Gino, 27,
  and Emil James, 23, in a London park, says she first saw BuzzBallz on TikTok,
  where there are more than 50,000 videos of people taste-testing them. In a
  viral video to her 991,000 followers, the influencer Heather Bowling drinks a
  Chili Mango before a night out in Manchester, a voiceover of Samantha Jones
  from Sex and the City in the background. There’s a #buzzballchallenge to see
  how people react to drinking them. “People litter them a lot, so you see them
  around,” says James. “It’s actually really good advertising. They’re
  everywhere.” Carlo-Gino chimes in: “But put them in the bin, guys.” BuzzBallz
  say they are packaged in 100% recyclable PET plastics. Are BuzzBallz actually
  any good? With the help of a few friends, I give them a go. We buy all six of
  the flavours stocked at my local shop. The Espresso Martini is watery and
  tastes like a strong black filter coffee, but it’s not bad. If I needed a
  pick-me-up on the way to a club, I’d probably give it another go. The Choc
  Tease is creamy and has a subtle hint of vodka – it tastes a bit like Baileys.
  The Pornstar Martini, made with vodka and passion fruit juice, tastes weirdly
  synthetic, as does the Strawberry ‘Rita with tequila and vodka. The Chili
  Mango, also with a tequila and vodka base, is my favourite. It’s very sugary
  but has a little kick from the jalapeños. All my friends were keen on the
  containers, until it came to finishing the last sip. The spherical shape means
  you have to tilt your head right back to drain it. Langford says she has
  noticed the alcopop revival – she’s seen Hooch around and is looking forward
  to trying WKD’s Irn-Bru flavour. She thinks BuzzBallz are fun but is just as
  happy to buy premixed Moth cocktails or a canned Cîroc Vodka Spritz. But the
  drinks are new and exciting for Lonergan, who didn’t grow up drinking alcopops
  in Sydney. “There’s no nostalgia attached. It’s like I’m living in the here
  and now. In the BuzzBallz era.”
