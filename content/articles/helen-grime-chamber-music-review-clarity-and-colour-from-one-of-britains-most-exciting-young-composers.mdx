  Helen Grime: Chamber Music review – clarity and colour from one of Britain’s
  most exciting young composers

  It has been mostly through her succession of successful high-profile
  orchestral commissions that Helen Grime has become one of the most prominent
  voices among the younger generations of British composers. In that process of
  recognition Grime’s smaller-scale works have received relatively little
  attention, but as this collection of seven recordings from the Hebrides
  Ensemble shows, the same qualities that characterise her largest orchestral
  canvases distinguish her work on the smallest scale too. The pieces here,
  composed between 2004 and 2016, range from a string sextet to a work for two
  horns, and Grime’s fastidious ear to colour and texture is evident in all the
  instrumental combinations. Several of the pieces take their inspiration from
  nature and landscape, though the sextet, Into the Faded Air, borrows its title
  from TS Eliot’s Four Quartets; Ted Hughes’s poetry lies behind the trio Snow
  and Snow, while the starting point for the crisp, vivid Seven Pierrot
  Miniatures, composed for the same instrumental lineup as Schoenberg’s Pierrot
  Lunaire, is obvious enough. But as all the Hebrides’ performances demonstrate,
  this music can communicate even without any of its external references. Listen
