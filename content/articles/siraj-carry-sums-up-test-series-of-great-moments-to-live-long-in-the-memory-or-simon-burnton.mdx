  The 1990 football World Cup was not, in truth, a great tournament, but it was
  a tournament of great moments, and in time they became all that was
  remembered. An often dreary event to live through – no World Cup has had an
  average fewer goals per match – it was rescued by the most remarkable of all
  curtain-raisers, Benjamin Massing’s assault on Claudio Caniggia, Roger Milla’s
  dancing, René Higuita’s goalkeeping, Lothar Matthäus’s wonder goal, David
  Platt’s volley, Frank Rijkaard and Rudi Völler, Gazza’s tears. In the end,
  these moments are all that get remembered. It has gone down as a classic. This
  series has gone through the same process in fast forward. Marked more than
  anything by players bravely hauling themselves beyond the brink of exhaustion
  on flat wickets, it has simply produced too many great moments to not in fact
  be great. Already the longueurs have fallen from the memory, leaving only
  legends: Rishabh Pant’s acrobatics; the Headingley run chase; Shubman Gill’s
  269 and Akash Deep’s 10 wickets; Jofra Archer striking with his third ball
  back in Test cricket; time-wasting, fury, “the spirit of the game”; Shoaib
  Bashir winning a Test with a freak wicket taken while bowling with a multiply
  fractured finger; Pant limping out to bat at Old Trafford; a cameo from future
  pub quiz question Anshul Kamboj; Ben Stokes bowling his way out of the series
  with a barely functional right arm; India refusing to fold, or to accept the
  draw; four Tests (so far) going to the last session of the last day; the Oval
  groundkeeper Lee Fortis; Deep becoming England’s nightmare watchman; the
  dizzying narrative twists across the fourth day here. Thanks to a brief, heavy
  and deeply inconvenient shower this game, like all the rest, has gone to a
  fifth day, having seemed set to become the second of the series to end with
  India coming to terms with unexpected defeat. The words of Washington Sundar
  with one day of the third Test remaining still linger: “Winning a Test at
  Lord’s is going to be amazing. We’re sitting pretty.” A few weeks later and a
  few miles away, on Saturday night at the Oval it was Yashasvi Jaiswal who
  summed up his team’s thinking: “We are really confident. We just need to keep
  bowling in the right areas.” Jaiswal, more than anyone, had every reason to
  think fate was on India’s side this time. He had been on 40, towards the end
  of the third day, when he sent the ball steepling straight to the fielder at
  deep fine leg – Liam Dawson, on the field because of Chris Woakes’s shoulder
  injury – who simply had no idea what was going on. Dawson sensed people
  turning in his direction, deduced he was about to be involved in something,
  needed only to work out what it was. And then, in the most literal sense, it
  hit him. India led by 32 as the ball bounced off Dawson and on to the ground,
  and when Jaiswal was eventually dismissed deep into the following day he had
  stretched that to precisely 250. It seemed then that a moment of calamitous
  deep fielding would decide the game, and as the end came into view it still
  did. The only question was which one. Mohammed Siraj has had a phenomenal
  series. No amount of praise could be too much. Nobody has bowled as many
  overs, taken as many wickets, given so much of themselves. Only slips and
  wicketkeepers have taken more catches. It was Siraj who Bashir dismissed to
  end the Lord’s Test, after he had faced 30 deliveries for four gutsy,
  stubborn, determined runs. Even his body language, his wonderful ability to
  physically express the situation in which he finds himself, is unrivalled. He
  has been magnetic, magnificent, an outsider who is simply unprepared to be
  anything but integral. And just as it seemed to have swung closed it was Siraj
  who thrust open the door for England to win the series. Harry Brook was on 19,
  and England still 237 runs from their target, when he attacked a short
  delivery from Prasidh Krishna. It was an ugly shot, leaden-footed, top-edged
  towards deep backward square leg where Siraj stood. He set himself for the
  catch, waited, watched, and safely collected the ball. Krishna spread his arms
  in celebration; KL Rahul sprinted from the slips to congratulate the bowler;
  Siraj took a step back, on to the boundary padding. Instead of raising a
  finger, the umpire raised both arms. When Brook was finally dismissed –
  caught, inevitably, by Siraj, which even then felt more like cruelty than
  redemption – England needed only 73. In the final analysis Siraj seemed
  destined to have had a phenomenal, brilliant, inspiring, humiliating failure
  of a series. In the end, these moments are all that are remembered – but still
  there is time for a couple more.
