  “Port Vale have played Everton at Priory Road, Anfield, Goodison Park and now
  the Hill Dickinson Stadium,” notes Kevin Doran. “Is there an example of any
  other team having played another team at four or more home grounds?” Philip
  Davis starts us off with a likely potential host: “Brighton &amp; Hove Albion
  have had four home grounds since 1902. After the Goldstone Ground (1902-97),
  the Seagulls ground-shared at Gillingham’s Priestfield home in 1997-98 and
  1998-99 (both seasons spent in the fourth tier). After 12 years at the
  Withdean Stadium (1999-2011), they moved to the purpose-built Amex Stadium.
  “Five clubs played Brighton in what was then Division Three at Priestfield and
  have also played at the Goldstone, Withdean and Amex: Hull City, Cardiff,
  Swansea, Doncaster and Brentford. Brighton also hosted Millwall in the 1998-99
  Football League Trophy at Gillingham, and at their other three home grounds.”
  Ken Foster takes us from Brighton to Bristol. “Grimsby Town, York City and
  Portsmouth have played away fixtures at Bristol Rovers at four different
  grounds,” he notes. Rovers played at the Eastville Stadium from 1887 to 1996,
  then spent a decade at Bath City’s Twerton Park before moving back to Bristol
  at the Memorial Ground – a total of three venues.” Allow Ken to elaborate:
  “Rovers played five games at Bristol City’s Ashton Gate in the 1980-81 season
  after the Eastville stand fire, and those three teams were among the visitors.
  The other two matches were against Oldham Athletic and Newcastle United but
  they never played Rovers at Twerton Park.” It was a dismal season for both
  Bristol clubs, as both were relegated from Division Two. Only the Grimsby game
  was a league match; the visits of York and Pompey were League Cup contests.”
  Tottenham have called Northumberland Park, White Hart Lane, Wembley and the
  Tottenham Hotspur Stadium home over their 143-year history – and we have dug
  up examples of Southampton and Arsenal having visited them at these four
  venues. Liverpool Women have played at a number of different home grounds over
  the years and Everton have travelled for derbies at The Halton Stadium,
  Prenton Park, Anfield and The Totally Wicked Stadium. They may even have faced
  each other with Liverpool the home team at West Lancashire College before
  2012. Can any teams do better than four away grounds? It’s complicated.
  Wimbledon FC played at three different home venues as a Football League club –
  the old Plough Lane, Selhurst Park and Milton Keynes’ National Hockey Stadium
  in 2003-04. After being renamed MK Dons the following season, the club
  relinquished its claim to Wimbledon’s histories and trophies in 2006. AFC
  Wimbledon, who were promoted to the EFL in 2011, claim to be the original
  club’s “spiritual successors” and have played their matches at Kingsmeadow and
  the new Plough Lane stadium, which opened in 2020. So if we accept – as the
  average travelling fan might do – that Wimbledon FC and AFC are essentially
  the same club, we can find nine teams who have played them at all five
  different venues. Bradford City, Gillingham, Rotherham, Sunderland and Walsall
  have played league games at all five grounds. Four other teams have completed
  the set thanks to a Cup tie: Coventry (League Cup tie at the new Plough Lane
  in August 2023), Crewe (FA Cup replay at Selhurst Park in Jan 1997), Ipswich
  (Zenith Data Systems Cup tie at the old Plough Lane in 1990) and Wigan (League
  Cup tie at Selhurst Park in Sept 2000). Another eight teams – Blackpool,
  Bolton, Charlton, Grimsby, Notts County, Portsmouth, Swindon and Tranmere –
  have played either incarnation of Wimbledon at four different away grounds.
  Blackpool made the cut by playing AFC Wimbledon at Loftus Road in the 2020-21
  season; the team played four games at QPR’s ground before moving into the new
  Plough Lane, all behind closed doors. Can you find better examples of teams
  meeting at many different home grounds? If so, get in touch. The offside
  goalie “We all love it when a goalie comes up for a last-minute set piece,”
  stated Simon Buckton. “But has a goalkeeper ever been flagged for offside – or
  better still, had a goal disallowed for offside?” Thanks to the many, many
  readers who got in touch to remind us of a famous example. Duncan Jones was
  first to reply, so over to him: “Peter Schmeichel scored this absolute beauty
  in an FA Cup replay against Wimbledon in 1997, that was tragically disallowed.
  He was only off by three or four feet for crying out loud – and in true 90s
  style, Andy Cole was also offside for good measure.” A long way to go “Truro
  City, who begin their first season in the National League on Saturday, are
  going to have some very long trips,” wrote Mel Slattery. “The distance from
  their stadium to Gateshead’s is 457 miles, according to Google Maps. Have two
  clubs in England ever met who are based further apart? Competitively or
  otherwise.” Andy Clark chimes in with a resounding “Yes! My local team,
  Whitley Bay, in fact travelled to Truro for an FA Vase last-16 tie in 2008.
  According to Google, this is six miles further, and all the players involved
  were part-time. Whitley Bay won 3-0, lost to Lowestoft Town in the next round,
  before winning the Vase for the next three seasons. Unlike most of their later
  opponents in those years, Whitley have not been promoted since.” Chris Roe
  cannot find a fixture in the Football League with a greater straight-line
  distance between the two teams’ home grounds. Fourteen pairs of teams have
  faced off with more than 300 miles between them as the crow flies, with
  Newcastle United and Plymouth Argyle being the furthest apart. Here is Chris’s
  table of all 14 games – with Argyle featuring eight times: Knowledge archive
  “As an Arsenal fan, I’ve noticed that whenever we win the Community Shield, we
  inevitably go on not to win the league,” asked Matt Tread way back in 2005.
  “Is there a curse?” Going back to the start of the Charity Shield in 1908,
  only 14 teams had gone on the win the league after winning the season’s
  curtain-raiser. At the time of the question, no side had won the Charity
  Shield and gone on to win the league since Manchester United trounced
  Newcastle 4-0 in 1996. Arsenal have won the league 13 times, but only three of
  those were preceded by a Charity Shield victory: in 1930, 1933 and in 1934.
  The Gunners opened the season with Charity Shield victories in 1998, 1999 and
  2002 – only for United to win the title on each occasion. 2025 update: With
  Liverpool taking on Crystal Palace at Wembley this Sunday, what has changed in
  the last 20 years? Well, five out of the six winners between 2005 and 2010
  went on to win the title – Manchester United (three times) and Chelsea (twice)
  but since then, only Manchester City in 2018-19 have done the Shield/title
  double. As for Arsenal, they’ve won five Community Shields since 2005 … and no
  league titles. Can you help? “Within 16 minutes of the season starting,
  Salford debutant Kadeem Harris had scored at both ends in against Crewe. Has
  anyone scored a quicker own goal-proper goal combo either a) to start a
  season, b) on their debut or c) in any match?” asks Richard Wilson. “Kiernan
  Dewsbury-Hall has just joined a third club who play in blue. Which player
  (excluding loans) has represented the most clubs who wear the same coloured
  shirt? And has a none one-club player gone through his whole career wearing
  only one colour?” asks George Jones. “I recently came across one of the more
  bizarre footballing tales: that of Michael Reddy, a former Sunderland
  prospect,” begins Mark Moran. “Multiple sources (fan sites, the Northern Echo,
  and even Transfermarkt) claim he left Grimsby in 2007 for FC Malamuk in
  Greenland, then moved to Port Stanley Albion after meeting a Falkland Islander
  at a fish festival. Surely there’s more myth than truth to this?” “I have just
  heard CMAT’s song Vincent Kompany because I am cool, young and relevant,”
  writes the cool, young and relevant Will Unwin. “I was wondering if any other
  player’s name is the title of a song, beyond simply being referred to?” Mail
