  The bank share selloff has gathered pace. NatWest are now down 4.7%, followed
  by Lloyds (-4.5%) and Barclays (-3.7%), with HSBC down a more modest 0.5%. By
  my maths, this wipes around £7bn off the value of the UK’s Big Four banks. The
  drop in bank shares has pulled down the wider London stock market. The FTSE
  100 share idex is down 25 points, or 0.27%, at 9192 points this morning “The
  UK stock market ended the week on a sour note amid suggestions that the
  government could help to fill its fiscal hole with a new tax on the banking
  sector,” says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, adding: “Some of the
  biggest names in the FTSE 100 are lenders so if they’re out of favour on the
  stock market, it acts as a drag on the whole UK blue-chip index. “NatWest,
  Lloyds and Barclays were the FTSE 100’s biggest fallers on Friday morning as
  investors wondered if the era of bumper profits, dividends and buybacks is now
  under threat. “These companies have enjoyed a strong run on the stock market
  in recent years, and they’ve also played an important role in lending money to
  small and large businesses which helps to create jobs and support the UK
  economy. “The timing of the tax debate, fuelled by a report from think-tank
  IPPR, is unfortunate given it coincides with a new poll from Lloyds suggesting
  a rise in business confidence, despite cost pressures. This positive sentiment
  could be threatened if businesses take the view that a new tax on banks might
  force lenders to tighten their lending criteria. P&amp;O Ferries have
  confirmed that CEO Peter Hebblethwaite is resigning, explaining: “Peter
  Hebblethwaite has communicated his intention to resign from his position as
  Chief Executive Officer to dedicate more time to family matters. P&amp;O
  Ferries extends its gratitude to Peter Hebblethwaite for his contributions as
  CEO over the past four years. “During his tenure the company navigated the
  challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, initiated a path towards financial
  stability, and introduced the world’s first large double-ended hybrid ferries
  on the Dover-Calais route, thereby enhancing sustainability. We extend our
  best wishes to him for his future endeavours.” Sky News are reporting that
  Peter Hebblethwaite, the chief executive of P&amp;O Ferries, is leaving the
  company. Hebblethwaite, who was voted the “Worst Boss in the World” by trade
  unionists in 2022, has reportedly resigned for personal reasons. Hebblethwaite
  attracted heavy criticism in 2022 after P&amp;O controversially fired 800 crew
  without warning, and replaced them with low-paid agency staff working longer
  hours. He subsequently receivd a pay rise of at least 55%. India’s currency
  has sunk to a record low, on fears that US tariffs will hurt its economy. The
  rupee has dropped by -0.7% today to 88.23 rupees to the dollar, its weakest
  level on record. Traders sold the rupee after Washington imposed an additional
  25% tariff on Indian goods this week, doubling the total duties faced by the
  South Asian nation to 50%, as a penalty for buying Russian oil. The tariffs,
  which came into effect just after midnight on Wednesday in Washington, risk
  inflicting significant damage on the Indian economy and further disrupting
  global supply chains. With bank shares sliding, investors are piling into
  defence stocks instead. Babcock (+1.4%), Melrose (+0.95%) and BAE Systems
  (+0.7%) are all among the FTSE 100 risers, as optimism over a breakthough in
  the Russia-Ukraine war fades. German chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters
  last night that there was “obviously” not going to be a meeting between
  President Zelenskyy and President Putin, despite Donald Trump’s push for a
  peace deal. Bloomberg’s Paul J Davies isn’t convinced by the IPPR’s call for a
  windfall tax on the banks. Posting on Blue Sky, he argues that it would be
  paid out of the interest that would otherwise go to savers, suggesting it
  could actually function as a “backdoor wealth tax”. But Davies also questions
  how much money new bank taxes would raise, posting: They are also talking
  again about a special extra profit tax for banks - Rayner suggested upping
  total take from 28% to 30%. Do you know how much this will raise? Based on OBR
  forecasts it would bring in an extra  £275m per year.  Kathleen Brooks,
  research director at XTB, fears the swirl of budget rumours could hurt
  confidence (undermining the rise in morale this month). She explains: The
  decline in UK shares are led by the banks, which are all weighing on the FTSE
  100 as rumours swirl of yet another tax rise, this time a windfall tax on
  lenders. Financials are down 1% on Friday, led by a 3% drop for NatWest, a
  2.5% drop in Lloyds and a 2% fall for Barclays. The drip feed of potential tax
  rises to be included in this budget have dominated the papers this month,
  however, so far, the FTSE 100 has been resilient to this. However, now that it
  seems Rachel Reeves is going after the FTSE 100’s big hitters like banks, this
  could weigh on the index as we lead up to the Autumn budget. US stocks
  outperformed their European peers in August, with the S&amp;P 500 rising by
  2%, compared to a 0.8% gain for the FTSE 100. This gap could widen, especially
  if we get the expected interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year,
  at the same time as the UK government seems focused on squeezing businesses
  and consumers with multiple tax increases later this year, which is eroding
  confidence and dimming UK growth prospects further. UK banks are under
  pressure, reports Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor. He
  explains: Overnight weakness in sterling would normally support the FTSE 100
  given its proliferation of overseas earnings, but reports of a potential
  windfall tax on the banks more than offset any hopes of a bright open. The
  domestic banks were worst hit, with NatWest and Lloyds losing around 3%, while
  the more diversified groups such as Barclays and HSBC limited losses to around
  1%. Unfortunately, any such rumours are likely to have an exaggerated impact
  given the government’s obvious need to raise more income in an attempt to
  mitigate its financial difficulties. Shares in UK banks are falling this
  morning as the sector fears it could be targeted in the autumn budget. NatWest
  (-3.7%), Lloyds Banking Group (-2.8%) and Barclays (-2.3%) are leading the
  fallers on the FTSE 100 share index, reflecting rising concerns that
  chancellor Rachel Reeves could target banks to help shore up the UK’s public
  finances. The IPPR think tank is this morning proposing that Rachel Reeves
  should levy a new bank tax. They argue that a “Thatcher-style tax on bank
  windfalls” could raise billions for public services. The IPPR points out that
  the UK government is currently spending billions of pounds a year compensating
  the Bank of England for losses on its quantitative easing programme, which is
  now being unwound. The BoE is also paying out higher interest rates on banks’
  reserves than it is receiving on the bonds it still owns through QE. In total,
  these losses amount to a £22bn-a-year hit to the public finances, according to
  the IPPR, which is calling for the Treasury to tax the big banks on their
  QE-related reserves. Carsten Jung, associate director for economic policy at
  IPPR, said: “The Bank of England and Treasury bungled the implementation of
  quantitative easing. What started as a programme to boost the economy is now a
  massive drain on taxpayer money. Public money is flowing straight into
  commercial banks’ coffers because of a flawed policy design. While families
  struggle with rising costs, the government is effectively writing
  multi-billion-pound cheques to bank shareholders. “This is not how QE was
  meant to work – and no other major economy does it this way. A targeted levy,
  inspired by Margaret Thatcher’s own approach in the 1980s, would recoup some
  these windfalls and put the money to far better use – helping people and the
  economy, not just bank balance sheets.” The Financial Times reports that fears
  are growing in the City of London that Reeves could announce a surcharge on
  the banking sector’s profits, or a new bank levy. One City figure told the FT:
  “We aren’t stupid. There’s a bunch of Labour MPs, including Angela Rayner, who
  are looking for ways to get more money. Financial services are an obvious
  target.” In the financial markets, the US dollar is on track to record a 2%
  monthly drop as traders anticipate Donald Trump will soon get his way on
  interest rate cuts. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against
  six major peers, is slightly higher this morning but still course for a 2%
  decline for the month. The index is down around 10% this year, hit by anxiety
  over US economic policy as Trump’s trade wars pushed investors towards
  alternative assets. Trump’s attempts to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed board,
  and his plans for a replacement for chair Jerome Powell, show that the White
  House is determined to push for lower interest rates. Deutsche Bank told
  clients this morning: Investors remain heavily focused on the Federal
  Reserve’s independence, and today there’s going to be an emergency hearing
  about Lisa Cook’s position on the Board of Governors that’s due to start at
  10am EST. So this is going to be critically important for markets, as her
  removal would give President Trump the opportunity to refashion the Board of
  Governors in a more dovish direction. UK companies are also eyeing up more
  price rises. In August, the net balance of firms expecting to raise prices
  over the next year was up four points to 65%. 67% (from 65%) of firms said
  they would raise prices in the coming year, while those anticipating price
  reductions fell slightly to 2% (from 4%), Lloyds says. There’s good news for
  workers, too, in the latest business barometer. Wage growth expectations
  increased by four points, with 38% forecasting average pay increases of 3% or
  more. Firms expecting to increase wages by 4% rose five points to 23%, while
  those forecasting 5% or higher also climbed five points to 12%. That would
  help employees handle the rise in UK inflation, which hit 3.8% in July. But it
  might concern the Bank of England, where some policymakers fear that increased
  earnings could lead to a further rise in prices… Businesses across five of the
  UK’s twelve regions and nations saw a rise in confidence in August, but the
  increase was not universal. London, the East of England and the West Midlands
  saw strong improvements this month. However, firms in Wales were less
  confident, with a fall of 13 points, Lloyds reports. Good morning, and welcome
  to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world
  economy. Despite the tides of gloom lapping the UK economy, business
  confidence has pushed up this month. The latest poll of business morale from
  Lloyds Banking Group shows that British businesses’ confidence in their
  trading prospects has hit the highest level since 2014, after rising sharply
  this month. According to Lloyds, manufacturers’ confidence is the highest in a
  decade – welcome news for the government as chancellor Rachel Reeves and her
  team work on the autumn budget. Retailers’ confidence also increased, to a
  five-month high, but construction confidence fell to a four-month low.
  Interestingly, the Lloyds Business Barometer has found that hiring intentions
  increased for the fourth month in a row, despite cost pressures. That
  indicates many businesses are coping with the £26bn increase in employers’
  national insurance announced by Reeves last year, and the latest increase in
  the minimum wage. Economic optimism edged down for the first time since April,
  though, indicating increased jitters about the economic outlook. Hann-Ju Ho,
  senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: “This continued
  upward trend in business confidence suggests UK firms remain optimistic about
  their own trading prospects while there is a modest cooling of confidence in
  the wider UK economy. Firms are focusing on what they can control, with many
  looking to pursue growth opportunities, including entering new markets and
  adopting new technologies. “Wage expectations have seen a notable shift this
  month, but it remains to be seen whether this signals the start of a sustained
  trend or a temporary uplift, as they have been broadly stable in recent
  months.” The agenda 7.45am BST: French GDP and consumer spending data 1.30pm
