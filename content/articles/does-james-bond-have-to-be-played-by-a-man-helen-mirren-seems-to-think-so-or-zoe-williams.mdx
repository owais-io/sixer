  ‘I’m such a feminist,” Helen Mirren told Saga magazine, but there are some
  jobs a woman can’t do. To be precise: “You can’t have a woman [as James Bond].
  It just doesn’t work. James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes
  something else.” Mirren is starring opposite Pierce Brosnan in the film
  adaptation of Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club, in which they both
  play amateur sleuths in a care home. Happily, that is a unisex job. Brosnan
  might also describe himself as “such a feminist” – he has never said so
  explicitly, but in 2019, he said a female Bond would be “exhilarating”.
  However, he’s now back on team men, saying: “I’m so excited to see the next
  man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this
  character.” Exhilaration, excitement, exuberance: all qualities I don’t think
  I’ve ever seen in any Bond, across the great gamut of maleness, from Connery
  to Craig. But who am I to judge? Whenever 007 gets a new pen that can poison
  someone from 50 paces, the thrill racing through his veins might be implied by
  his slightly less stern visage. Truly, masculinity is an unknowable frontier.
  A couple of things, before we hand the franchise over to Amazon, who bought it
  for more than $1bn earlier this year. The essential qualities of Bond are as
  follows: he can kill on command without conscience, except when he has a
  conscience; he is patriotic; he is irresistible to women; he favours
  discreetly tailored, monochrome clothing; he can drink neat spirits without
  becoming intoxicated; and he always introduces himself in reverse order, to
  people who tend to already know his name. None of this screams “man”, except
  perhaps the patriotism, if you understand emotionally charged nationalism as a
  drumbeat of the patriarchy. Having said that, women can serve the patriarchy
  just as well as men – look at Mirren. Sorry, that is totally uncalled for: her
  feminist membership cannot be revoked, at least not on the basis of her Bond
  opinions, since that would be handing 007 too much power in the realm of
  gender. On a separate point: is Bond a feminist, and if he is, does that mean
  it’s fine for him to remain a man in perpetuity? It’s a tricky one. His value
  system has changed so much over the 25 films, from his early “lovable
  chauvinist” years to his late “anguished quester after the truth of the self”
  iteration, a lesser person than myself might think the masculine ideal had
  itself gone on a journey since it first put on a dinner jacket in 1962. That,
  however, is a fruitless line of analysis, since if we were to take James Bond
  as too literal a representation of the changing social expectations of men,
  we’d have to conclude that they can be any which way, so long as they’re
  prepared to take out a minor dictator with piano wire and have a disregard for
  due process. Arguably more important than any of that is what the Amazon
  takeover will do to the franchise, given the semi-recent history of the tech
  company – it invented an AI recruitment tool in 2018 that effectively trained
  itself to prefer male candidates; it was shown to have embedded sexism in its
  sports coverage, after Alexa didn’t know what a Lioness was; and, according to
  employees, it has an office culture in which you’re never not at work, which
  automatically excludes sane people – and come on, a lot of those are going to
  be women. Does this sound like a safe pair of hands to take over the
  management of a fictional character whose arc we would hope is going to
  continue to bend towards gender justice? Not really, but at the same time, if
  Amazon did spring a female Bond on the world, and used that as
  feminist-washing, proof in perpetuity that none of the sexist algorithms were
  created deliberately, well, that would be quite annoying. Nobody overreact,
  but surely what this moment in history is crying out for is a gender-fluid
  Bond. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist • Do you have an opinion on the
