  Britain has a new species of butterfly: the southern small white has continued
  its rapid colonisation of northern Europe by flying across the North Sea. The
  species looks very similar to the native small, large and green-veined whites
  but two individuals spotted in County Durham and Suffolk this summer have been
  verified as Pieris mannii, which was once confined to southern Europe.
  Assisted by global heating, the southern small white has made rapid progress
  across Europe since it was first spotted north of the Alps in France and
  Germany in 2008. It reached the Netherlands in 2015 and was recorded near
  Calais four years later. “This is really exciting,” said Dr Dan Hoare, the
  director of nature recovery at Butterfly Conservation. “It’s always
  interesting when a new species turns up in the UK, but the southern small
  white has been gradually moving northwards through Europe for over a decade
  and we were just waiting for it to be seen in England for the first time. Top
  marks to the eagle-eyed snappers who not only got photos, but also realised
  the significance of what they’d seen.” The southern small white is
  distinguished from the native whites by tiny differences in the black markings
  on its forewing tips. On a southern small white these are square in shape,
  with the black reaching down the outside of the wing to a point level with a
  black spot further in from the border. Free apps such as ObsIdentify, created
  by a Dutch non-profit foundation, are making identification easier – if people
  can obtain photos. The first sighting was made by the birdwatcher Martyn
  Sidwell in Hartlepool on 1 July, and a second by William Brame at Landguard
  nature reserve in Suffolk on 2 August. The latter sighting was verified by
  Chris van Swaay, the chair of Butterfly Conservation Europe, who has been
  tracking the species’ progress for years. Lepidopterists hope the species will
  now become established in Britain, assisted by gardeners. Unlike the large
  white, which is infamous for its caterpillars devouring brassicas, the
  caterpillars of the southern small white feed on candytuft, an evergreen shrub
  which is widely planted in gardens. The sightings follow the sunniest ever
  spring on record, and a large influx of small whites migrating over the sea to
  Britain. In the charity’s Big Butterfly Count this year, reports of the
  spectacular Jersey Tiger moth – a species which just a decade ago was
  restricted to the Channel Islands and the south coast of England – have risen
  78% on last year, with sightings as far north as Birmingham. Hoare added: “We
  always love to see butterflies and moths doing well in the UK, but we also
  know there are going to be winners and losers from the very rapid climate
  change we’re experiencing. “One way we can increase the number of climate
  winners is by managing habitats positively so that threatened species can
  benefit as well as widespread mobile species. That means creating and
  maintaining good quality, connected habitat at a landscape scale.”
