  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 9th (NB: this is not necessarily Will
  Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 15th Prospects The big hope is that Manchester United hit rock
  bottom last season and things cannot get any worse. They are in effect
  starting again because ending up 15th in the Premier League resulted in many
  executives, fans and players waking up in a cold sweat. Expectations within
  the fanbase are impressively low, not knowing what to expect from a team that
  stumbled through an entire campaign. There is no European distraction for
  Ruben Amorim, allowing him plenty of time on the training ground to get his
  ideas across. When the Portuguese head coach succeeded Erik ten Hag last
  November, his role was more firefighter than problem solver. He was allowed to
  evaluate the squad quickly and made his decision on who were and were not up
  for the battle that the club found themselves in. Those players have either
  left or are in the process of doing so, leaving behind those who possess the
  character, if not the technical expertise, that Amorim thinks can benefit his
  plans. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have arrived in the hope they will
  ignite an underperforming team and club. United scored a pitiful 44 goals in
  38 Premier League games, causing much embarrassment. The pair have the
  capabilities to create and score goals, skills that were lacking among the
  players Amorim inherited. After those deals were completed for a combined
  £130m, the search for a competent No 9 eventually concluded with Benjamin
  Sesko joining from RB Leipzig for £73.3m to fill the void, leaving plenty of
  pressure on the new front three. Winning only seven home games out of 19 last
  time around was a stain on the club. Amorim will need to ensure his solutions
  work as they cannot be repeated. Arsenal visit on the opening weekend; the
  display and the result will provide an indication as to whether things will be
  different this time around. The manager Arriving mid-season is always
  difficult for a head coach, especially when his ideas did not align with what
  was available within the squad, but Amorim was insistent on playing 3-4-3
  regardless. He was given a relatively free ride because what had gone before
  was so utterly awful, but a 15th-placed finish and a meek Europa League final
  loss to Tottenham were clear indicators of the rebuild required. Ideally,
  Amorim would have carried out a complete overhaul of the squad but finances
  have dictated otherwise. If things do not start well, he may need to alter his
  ideals and become more pragmatic, or he may become the latest coach to fail to
  turn the ship around. Off-field picture After a plethora of redundancies and
  constant cost-cutting measures, United are aiming to return to stable ground
  soon but these actions do little for the morale of the employees who have
  stayed. Many more long-serving staff left in the final weeks of last season
  and over the summer, pleased to get out of the club. A lack of European
  football will irritate the accountants at Old Trafford but Sir Jim Ratcliffe
  will hope the promise of a new stadium will appease fans. A lot are angry over
  an increase in ticket prices and some being forced to move seats, creating an
  uneasy atmosphere. Star signing A lot – but not all – the eggs have been
  placed in a Cunha-shaped basket. The Brazilian is exactly the sort of player
  Amorim wanted as one of his No 10s and he has shown at Wolves what he is
  capable of. He likes the ball at his feet and can do amazing things when he is
  given the freedom to do so. The Brazilian is a natural talent, a street
  footballer who has matured into a Premier League player, but one man does not
  make a team. His temperament has come into question, too, after two
  suspensions following losses of composure last season, but United need some
  fire after looking meek for far too long. Stepping up Rasmus Højlund really
  does try extremely hard but does not look up to the job and his scoring record
  (26 goals in 95 games) reflects that, leaving opportunities for Chido Obi to
  be Sesko’s support act. Amorim offered Obi opportunities late in the season to
  come off the bench to try to bring greater energy to the forward line. Obi
  arrived from Arsenal a year ago, a sign of intent that the club want to bring
  in high-potential players as part of a long-term strategy. He scored 14 goals
  across 23 matches in various age groups and will be eager to build on that. A
  big season for … It is quite difficult to pick one individual considering
  almost no one impressed throughout last season, at least on a consistent
  basis. Kobbie Mainoo never fitted into what Amorim had planned and was moved
  around or sat on the bench, while the head coach insisted the England
  midfielder had plenty to improve on and needed not to listen to the hype.
  Amorim does not think he can play regularly in the defensive role he was
  utilised in under Ten Hag, requiring someone with greater mobility in the
  position, so he will need to decide if he can adapt or he may need to depart.
