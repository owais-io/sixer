  A Sheraton hotel in Louisiana has been used by immigration officials to hold
  people who are being deported, in what appears to be a contradiction of a
  position Sheraton’s parent company, Marriott, took in 2019 when it said its
  properties would not be used in cooperation with Ice. The Intercept first
  reported that the hotel, located on MacArthur Drive in Alexandria, Louisiana,
  near a major deportation hub and airport used by Ice, had been used by
  immigration officials earlier this month to hold a father and his teenage son
  for four days after their arrest in New York. They were then deported to
  Ecuador. The Intercept cited phone-tracking evidence that had been shared with
  the publication and was later seen by the Guardian. The evidence corroborates
  the account of a source with knowledge of hotel operations in Alexandria, who
  told the Guardian that they believed the venue had been used to detain
  immigrant families and unaccompanied children since it was renovated in late
  2023. The source observed Ice contractors known to assist in the transfer of
  unaccompanied minors operating at the Sheraton as recently as June of this
  year. The source added that other hotels in the area have also been used to
  hold immigrant families. It is not clear whether Marriott has a formal
  contract with Ice or what the company knows about Ice’s use of the Sheraton in
  Alexandria. In one case that emerged last year, Marriott sued a New York-based
  franchise after the hotel entered a partnership with the city for it to be
  used as an immigrant shelter, saying it had done so without Marriott’s
  consent. Marriott did not respond to several requests for comment. “It would
  be highly unfortunate if major hotel chains are facilitating the Trump
  administration’s cruel policy of deporting families,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy
  director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. In 2019, during Donald
  Trump’s first term, Marriott rejected the idea that any of its hotels or
  properties – which include Sheraton and Courtyard hotels – would be used by
  Ice to detain immigrants. It made the statement at a time when the Trump
  administration was calling for a mass roundup of undocumented immigrants.
  Citing anonymous sources, ABC News reported at the time that administration
  officials had internally discussed the possibility that they might need hotel
  rooms because of limited capacity at Ice detention centers. “Our hotels are
  not configured to be detention facilities, but to be open to guests and
  community members as well. While we have no particular insights into whether
  the US government is considering the use of hotels to aid in the situation at
  the border, Marriott has made the decision to decline any requests to use our
  hotels as detention facilities,” a company spokesperson said in July 2019,
  according to ABC News. The company’s position won it plaudits at the time,
  such as public recognition by the American Historical Association, an
  association of professional historians, which announced in a public statement
  that it appreciated Marriott’s “principled stand” and noted the importance of
  immigrants to the hotel and related industries. It is well-documented that Ice
  does use hotels to house immigrant families who are being deported from the US
  or being transferred to other detention centers. In a case that attracted
  national attention in April, Ice detained two families in Louisiana with three
  of their US citizen children and held them incommunicado and under guard at a
  hotel for days on end, despite multiple attempts by family members and lawyers
  to contact them. The families, along with their US citizen children, were
  deported in the early hours of 25 April and, according to legal filings, had
  been held at a location in Alexandria. Filings in that case reviewed by the
  Guardian include a short, handwritten submission by one of the mothers written
  on paper that closely matches images of branded Sheraton notepads posted
  online. The Guardian could not independently confirm whether the families had
  been detained at the Sheraton in Alexandria. The Intercept’s reporting focused
  on the story of Edison Iza and his 15-year-old son, Roger, who were reportedly
  arrested by Ice at an immigration check-in New York on 9 August. The pair were
  then reportedly flown to Louisiana and “locked up” in the Sheraton hotel,
  where they stayed for four days without access to their phones or the
  internet. “We couldn’t call or go on the web to ask for help,” Roger told the
  Intercept. “Without our phones, we didn’t know any names or phone numbers.”
  Ice did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s questions about the agency’s
  use of the Sheraton, including whether it has a contract with the hotel or
  uses it on an ad hoc basis. The hospitality industry is especially vulnerable
  to Ice raids and the Trump administration’s deportation program, given the
  high percentage of workers in the industry who are undocumented. While the
  Department of Homeland Security issued guidance earlier this year that Ice
  agents were not to conduct raids at hotels, restaurants and farms, that
  guidance was later reversed, according to a June report in the Washington
  Post. About 34% of housekeepers, 24% of cooks and 20% of waitstaff employed by
  the US hotel industry is undocumented, according to the 2023 census.
