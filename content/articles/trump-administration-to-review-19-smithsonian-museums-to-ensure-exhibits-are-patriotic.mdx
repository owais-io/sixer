  The Trump administration is evidently extending its control of cultural
  representation at the Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum and research
  complex. In a letter posted on the White House website, the administration
  told the Smithsonian that it plans a wide review of exhibitions, materials and
  operations ahead of the US’s 250th anniversary celebrations in 2026. The
  letter to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, from
  Trump administration officials said the White House wants the museums’ program
  to reflect “unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American
  story” in keeping with an executive order issued in March that ordered the
  elimination of “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” from the
  Smithsonian and its museums. Museums will have 120 days to replace content the
  administration finds “divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying,
  historically accurate and constructive descriptions”. Donald Trump’s order
  from March, titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, said the
  president “aims to ensure that the Smithsonian is an institution that sparks
  children’s imagination, celebrates American history and ingenuity, serves as a
  symbol to the world of American greatness, and makes America proud”. Earlier
  in August, the museum removed and later amended an exhibit on US presidential
  impeachments that mentioned Trump’s two impeachments during his first term.
  Officials at the Smithsonian later said museum officials “were not asked by
  any administration or other government official to remove content from the
  exhibit”. But Monday’s letter to the institution, which was first obtained by
  the Wall Street Journal, places the institution under curatorial scrutiny
  ranging from public-facing exhibition text and online content to internal
  curatorial processes, exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist
  grants. “This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the president’s
  directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan
  narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the
  letter is reported to say. It was signed by Lindsey Halligan, White House
  senior associate; Vince Haley, the director of the domestic policy council,
  and Russ Vought; the director of the office of Management and Budget. Halligan
  was appointed to effectuate JD Vance’s oversight of the Smithsonian. In a
  statement, she said the review was “about preserving trust in one of our most
  cherished institutions”. Halligan added: “The Smithsonian museums and exhibits
  should be accurate, patriotic, and enlightening – ensuring they remain places
  of learning, wonder, and national pride for generations to come.” The formal
  review comes as the Trump administration placed Washington DC’s police
  department under direct federal control and deployed the national guard into
  the city, citing a public safety emergency related to crime and homelessness,
  though data shows a sharp decrease in violent crime. In January, Washington DC
  police and the US attorney’s office released a report showing that total
  violent crime in DC in 2024 was down 35% from the prior year, resulting in the
  lowest violent crime rate in more than 30 years. Meanwhile, data has
  consistently shown that unhoused people are more likely to be victimized by
  crimes than commit them. The review will initially focus on eight of the
  following Smithsonian museums: the National Museum of American History, the
  National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American
  History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National
  Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National
  Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. The White
  House’s letter said others will be reviewed at a later date. “The
  Smithsonian’s work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence,
  rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history,” the
  institution said in a statement. “We are reviewing the letter with this
  commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the
  White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents.” The Smithsonian’s
  board of regents had previously agreed to conduct a thorough review of all its
  museum and zoo content to eliminate political influence and bias. That
  preceded the resignation in June of Kim Sajet, the director of the National
  Portrait Gallery, who Trump said was involved with diversity initiatives he
  opposed. Separately, figurative painter Amy Sherald cancelled a career review
  of her work – including a portrait of Michelle Obama, the former first lady –
  at the Smithsonian over concerns that the institute would not show Trans
  Forming Liberty, a portrait of a transgender woman with pink hair and a blue
  dress holding a torch as the Statue of Liberty. Monday’s letter later goes
  further, however, ordering a review of exhibits planned for the US’s 250th
  birthday. It also is part of a broader push to assert oversight over a broad
  swathe of cultural and academic institutions. The White House states that
  museums should correct “divisive or ideologically driven” language with text
  that is “unifying, historically accurate”. A team from the White House
  reportedly plans to conduct observational visits and museum walk-throughs to
  document themes and messaging. The letter also said that the White House had
  asked to review organizational charts, visitor surveys, exhibited artists who
  received Smithsonian grants, outside partners and internal communications
  related to section and approval processes. The outlet said the White House had
  given 30 days for requested materials to be turned over and that it expected
  to complete its review by early 2026.
