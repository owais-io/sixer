  Naomi Klein and Angela Davis are among dozens of international scholars and
  writers who have signed a letter to the Guardian calling on the UK government
  to reverse the ban on Palestine Action. The letter applauds what it describes
  as a “growing campaign of collective defiance” against the ban and commends
  the hundreds of people who plan to risk arrest by declaring their support for
  Palestine Action during a mass protest in London on Saturday. Signatories from
  major academic institutions around the world also say they are “especially
  concerned” about the ban’s possible impact on universities across Britain and
  beyond. It comes as the pressure group Defend Our Juries plans to hold a “mass
  action” in London on Saturday where participants have been asked to hold up
  signs saying: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.” Police have
  warned they will carry out mass arrests of anyone contravening terrorism laws.
  A separate Palestine solidarity march is taking place in London on the same
  day. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, proscribed Palestine Action last month
  after activists caused an estimated £7m of damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton
  military base in Oxfordshire. On Wednesday, a cabinet minister urged members
  of the public to stay away from events supporting proscribed organisations.
  Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said the government would not dictate to
  police how they handled any action and added that some coverage had also been
  “conflating legitimate protests”. She commended pro-Palestinian protesters who
  she said had been peacefully demonstrating outside parliament. But she added:
  “There’s a difference between that and supporting a proscribed terror
  organisation that wishes harm on the British people. And I would just urge
  people to stay away from those sorts of events and to exercise their
  democratic rights in a peaceful and legitimate way.” The letter from Klein,
  Davis and others states: “As scholars dedicated to questions of justice and
  ethics we believe that Yvette Cooper’s recent proscription of Palestine Action
  represents an attack both on the entire pro-Palestine movement and on
  fundamental freedoms of expression, association, assembly and protest.” It
  adds: “As hundreds of people again risk arrest by joining street protests on 9
  August and as students and teachers prepare for the start of another turbulent
  academic year, we express our full solidarity with those mobilising on their
  campuses or in their workplaces and communities to put an immediate stop to
  the escalating genocide and to end all UK complicity with Israel’s crimes.”
  Along with Klein, the Canadian author and activist who is now a professor at
  the University of British Columbia, and Davis, a former member of the Black
  Panther party who is now a distinguished professor emerita at the University
  of California, Santa Cruz, other signatories include the American feminist
  philosopher Judith Butler, who is a distinguished professor at the University
  of California, Berkeley. Others who have signed the letter include the
  philosophers Étienne Balibar and Rebecca Comay. Historians include the Israeli
  political scientist Ilan Pappé of the University of Exeter and the
  British-Israeli academic Avi Shlaim of the University of Oxford. Prominent
  Palestinian signatories include Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor
  emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, Abdaljawad Omar, an
  assistant professor of philosophy and cultural studies at Birzeit University,
  and Haidar Eid, an associate professor of postcolonial literature at al-Aqsa
  University in Gaza. They are joined by the political thinker Michael Hardt of
  Duke University and Eyal Weizman, the British-Israeli founding director of
  Forensic Architecture and a professor at Goldsmiths, University of London.
  Their letter comes after 300 left-leaning Jewish figures, including the
  director Mike Leigh and the author Michael Rosen, earlier this week wrote to
  the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to describe the ban on Palestine Action as
  “illegitimate and unethical”. That letter, by the human rights lawyer Geoffrey
  Bindman KC and the playwright Gillian Slovo, also accused the government of
  “hand-wringing over the level of slaughter and suffering in Gaza and the West
  Bank” and of offering “tacit support” for the actions of the Israeli state.
