  Brent Hinds, the former lead guitarist of the acclaimed heavy metal group
  Mastodon, was killed in Atlanta overnight. Police said Hinds, 51, died late on
  Wednesday after his Harley-Davidson collided with a BMW SUV whose driver did
  not yield while making a turn. The crash occurred at about 11.35pm. The Fulton
  county medical examiner’s office later confirmed his death. Hinds co-founded
  Mastodon in 2000 alongside bassist Troy Sanders, guitarist Bill Kelliher and
  drummer Brann Dailor, and went on to gain recognition for his role in the
  Atlanta-based band. In a statement posted to Instagram, Mastodon said they
  were in a “state of unfathomable sadness and grief”. “We are heartbroken,
  shocked, and still trying to process the loss of this creative force with whom
  we’ve shared so many triumphs, milestones, and the creation of music that has
  touched the hearts of so many,” the band wrote. “Our hearts are with Brent’s
  family, friends, and fans. At this time, we please ask that you respect
  everyone’s privacy during this difficult time.” Earlier this year, Billboard
  reported that Mastodon and Hinds had “mutually decided to part ways”. But
  earlier this month, Hinds disputed that account, saying he was forced out and
  referring to his ex-bandmates as “horrible humans”. Mastodon released their
  debut album, Remission, in 2002. Their hardcore sound that combined prog-rock,
  alternative and grunge among other styles quickly caught the attention of
  heavy metal fans, and their follow-up record, Leviathan, elevated the group to
  the metal music mainstream. Despite the group’s heavy metal influences, Hinds
  told the Guardian back in 2009 that he felt the band were more classic rock
  than metal. “That’s the direction I’ve always wanted us to take,” he said. “I
  never wanted us to be this screaming, lumbering, lotsa-drum-solos band, I
  always wanted us to be this heavy, psychedelic thing.” Hinds also had a small
  foray into television when he, along with his former band members, made a
  brief appearance on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones as “wildings” in
  the show’s fifth season.
