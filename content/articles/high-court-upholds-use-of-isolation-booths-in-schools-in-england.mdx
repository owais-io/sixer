  The high court has upheld the use of isolation booths by schools in England,
  dashing the hopes of campaigners who argue they are stressful and stigmatising
  for pupils. A judge turned down an application for a judicial review of the
  use of isolation booths at a secondary school in Leeds, noting that there are
  few alternatives other than suspension, and that behaviour in two of the three
  cases submitted showed signs of improvement. The use of the booths has become
  a flashpoint within education, with an increasing number of schools using them
  to manage pupils with complex behaviour after budget cuts and shrinking local
  authority services had reduced the external support available. Lawyers for the
  three families argued that prolonged use of isolation booths for disruptive or
  violent behaviour was depriving children at John Smeaton academy in Leeds of
  education, with one child spending 83 days in isolation and 14 days suspended,
  totalling more than half the school year. Mrs Justice Collins Rice found the
  school had not “crossed the boundaries of what the law or good practice
  permits”, despite questions about the “reasonableness” of the policy and the
  lack of alternatives. Collins Rice said in her decision: “For serious or
  persistent misconduct, and for intolerable and relentless classroom
  disruptiveness, removal to isolation offers both school and student a vital
  alternative to removal from school altogether. “It keeps a student in
  supervised and supported education during the school day. It offers a
  structured way back to the classroom. It avoids where possible the accrual of
  a suspension record which ultimately becomes a conveyor belt to school
  exclusion.” Dan Rosenberg, a lawyer representing the claimants, said: “Of
  course, our clients are extremely disappointed by the outcome and are taking
  advice on an appeal. Yet while this ruling provides little reprieve for the
  families or their children in the immediate term, it is their hope that the
  case will shine a wider public light on the issues raised – both within their
  own trust and in schools across the country.” Under the school’s isolation
  policy, pupils were placed in supervised rooms, seated in booths and given
  academic work to complete. The policy included “pastoral conversation to
  support insight, wellbeing and the completion of the work set”, but no contact
  with other pupils. Tom Bennett, a former teacher and adviser to the Department
  for Education on behaviour policy, described the ruling as significant in
  supporting school leaders. He said: “Sometimes taking disruptive students out
  of the classroom and into temporary supervised spaces away from their victims
  is absolutely necessary, and I challenge anyone who disputes that to try and
  run challenging classes for a while and show us all how it’s done. “Every
  child has rights, which includes the rights of everyone else to a place of
  safety free from assault and abuse. Schools are doing their best to maintain
  good order, and this judgment helps to underpin that.” However, one school
  leader said schools needed to consider better pastoral support to cope with
  the wave of complex behaviours and special needs among children. She said:
  “You can’t let these behaviours flourish, of course, [and] the wider knock-on
  for the rest of the school would have been grim. But this is the cost of
  austerity. Secondary schools especially need that wider infrastructure within
  and around them, otherwise you are only left with contain or remove
  [policies].”
