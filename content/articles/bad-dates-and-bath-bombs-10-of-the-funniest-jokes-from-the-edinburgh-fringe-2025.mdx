  Olaf Falafel: We named our children War and Peace – it’s a long story. Andrew
  Doherty: At my lowest, I was kicked out of the museum for being inappropriate
  with Michelangelo’s David. I’d hit rock bottom. Bella Hull: I just got a
  personal trainer. She’s horrible to me but my body goal is a thicker skin. Rob
  Auton: Everyone is worried about AI. I’m more concerned with what the other
  vowels are up to. Ian Smith: People who say bath bombs are relaxing have
  clearly never tried to carry one home in the rain. Amelia Hamilton: I love
  getting Latin chat-up lines. I carpe every DM. Sikisa: This spider has been in
  my house so long, it should pay half the wifi. As a web developer, it can
  afford to. Chris Grace: I went on a date with a matador but there were too
  many red flags. Candace Bryan: America is like my ex-boyfriend. Our
  relationship was toxic, when I left everyone called me brave, and now every
  morning I pull up social media to see how ugly he’s getting. Rajiv Karia: I’m
  not nostalgic but I used to be. Those were the days. • All our Edinburgh
