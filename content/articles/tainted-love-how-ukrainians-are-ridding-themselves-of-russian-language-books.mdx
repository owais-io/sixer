  One day this summer, the Ukrainian artist Stanislav Turina took two of his
  books to his garden near Kyiv. One was a volume of poems by Alexander Pushkin.
  But Turina – a voracious reader, never without a couple of books in his
  backpack – had no plans to pick it up again. The 19th-century Russian has
  acquired a troubling resonance in Ukraine since the 2022 full-scale invasion
  of the country. He is frequently used by the invaders as a symbol of
  Russianness: huge posters depicting the writer were for example erected in the
  southern city of Kherson during its occupation. For many in Ukraine, it shows
  Pushkin is being co-opted as a cultural weapon in Russia’s war. Some would
  also argue that Pushkin’s poetry reinforced, and even helped form, Russia’s
  imperial ideology. Numerous statues of the writer have been dismantled since
  2022 while many streets named after him (there were at least 594 in 2018) have
  reverted to their former names, or been given new ones. Turina knew he could
  not sell the book. “You couldn’t give it to a friend, you couldn’t give it to
  a library,” he said. So in his garden, Turina gently, experimentally, placed
  his volume of Pushkin on the bonfire. Feeding Pushkin to the flames was not
  some grandiose gesture of hate. It was an artist’s private and exploratory
  act, he said. “I’m afraid to burn books, to destroy them,” he said. “For me
  it’s symbolic of being barbarian.” He said his purpose was quite different. He
  wanted find out how he would feel. Would there be any catharsis? Grief? Anger?
  “I didn’t feel anything. I felt nothing good, nothing bad,” he said. The
  second book in Turina’s hand was a volume of poetry by the contemporary
  Russian writer Dmitry Vodennikov. For him, this represented a very different
  literary relationship. While a student in the western city of Lviv in the
  early 2000s, Turina saw Vodennikov perform his work. It was a revelation. “It
  was something new, a new voice. I understood he was gay: it was between the
  lines. It was so tender. It was very cool,” he said. “I started to be his
  fan.” He told his parents he needed extra money for sports shoes. Then he
  spent what amounted to more than half his monthly student stipend on a single
  copy of poems by Vodennikov. “In time, I knew all his poetry,” said Turina.
  “He was part of my way of thinking, my vision of my work.” But then, after
  2022, Turina decided to check out Vodennikov’s position on the war – “and
  now,” he said, “I find he is a pro-war poet.” Turina decided to leave his
  former hero’s book in his garden – to decay. *** Across Ukraine, readers are
  facing decisions about what to do with their Russian-language books. Many
  people – and especially those in the creative and cultural community – have
  switched to using Ukrainian in their everyday lives. How best to “decolonise”
  from centuries of Russian and Soviet cultural influence is a frequent point of
  discussion. In many cases, Russian missiles have taken decisions out of
  individuals’ hands. On the morning of 23 June, for example – after a barrage
  of Shahed drones and cruise missiles – books in Russian, some apparently
  stained with blood, were part of the wreckage of an apartment block in the
  Shevchenkivskyi district of Kyiv. Ten people, including an 11-year-old, were
  killed in the attack. When Kateryna Iakovlenko’s apartment in Irpin just
  outside Kyiv took a direct hit in March 2022, all of the writer and curator’s
  books, including those in Russian, the language in which she was raised, were
  destroyed. So were all her other possessions. Three years on, she owns just
  two books in Russian, both translations from other languages, neither
  available in Ukrainian, and both gifts from their authors. Oleksandr Mykhed
  faced a similar situation when his house in Hostomel, near Kyiv, was hit in
  the first weeks of the full-scale invasion. In his book The Language of War,
  the writer, now a member of the armed forces, recounts visiting its ruins and
  finding his Dostoevskys and Nabokovs among the wreckage. The experience of
  losing his home has transformed his relationship to his possessions –
  including his books. “Once you have become a refugee, you are always thinking
  like a refugee,” he said. “Better not to feel sentimental about books. These
  are just kilos that you might have to think about what to do with, if you need
  to leave.” There are no Russian-language books, even translations of foreign
  literature, in his new library. This June, Mariana Matveichuk, a freelance
  journalist, took 90kg of Russian books to a recycling centre near her home
  town in western Ukraine. She was raised in a Ukrainian-speaking area, and
  attended a Ukrainian-speaking university in Kyiv in the early 2000s.
  Nevertheless at that point most inhabitants of the city, and many of her
  fellow students, were Russian-speaking. Many authors she was studying – the
  French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Rancière, for example – were
  also available in translation in Russian, but not Ukrainian. She said she had
  “a book fetish” and would frequent Kyiv’s sprawling secondhand book market at
  Pochaina. When she graduated, she hauled her stash of books back to western
  Ukraine by train. These are the volumes that she has now recycled – sparing
  Anton Chekhov’s letters and diaries. “I have personal respect for him. Chekhov
  is funny, I like his sense of humour,” she said. “And they are also hidden at
  my mum’s, so no one will see Russian books on my shelves.” She considered
  trying to sell her books back to dealers at the Pochaina book market, but “I
  thought no, I don’t want to give them a second life.” Looking back at the
  number of academic texts she had read in Russian as a student – despite being
  a Ukrainian-speaker at a Ukrainian-language university – she had reflected,
  she said, on the “subtle Russification” of the culture that had surrounded
  her. Clearing out her Russian books (“I got rid of Tolstoy, of Dostoevsky, of
  12 tomes by [poet and playwright Vladimir] Mayakovsky”) was also, she said, a
  way of “saying goodbye to some of my perceptions when I was 20. I am saying
  goodbye to what I thought was important.” *** There are, perhaps, as many
  shades of opinion on the question of what to do about one’s Russian books as
  their are book lovers. There are those who have decided to keep them because
  they are part of a family story – perhaps reflecting parents’ or grandparents’
  struggle to acquire them under the Soviet Union. There are those who have come
  to hate the Russian language, associating it with the thought-world and media
  bubble of the invading country, but have still held on to a book – a treasured
  Russian translation of Haruki Murakami, say – because it represents a part of
  their own past. In Kharkiv, for decades a principally Russian-speaking city,
  the artist Pavlo Makov uses Ukrainian in day-to-day life. But he does not
  intend to get rid of his Russian books. Many foreign-language titles still
  lack good Ukrainian translations, he said – a reflection of the relative
  dominance of Russia and Russian, compared with Ukraine and Ukrainian, in the
  post-Soviet global publishing market. And he was doubtful about the wisdom of
  destroying or recycling Russian-language books, since it can create
  associations with the actions of authoritarian regimes. “I think that for the
  image of Ukraine, it’s not a good idea to do things like that. OK, you hate
  the Russian language. I understand it. But a book is a source of information.”
  In fact, studying Russian books and literature was important, he said,
  “because this country is our enemy, and this is enemy is very close. We should
  examine, we should research it.” In Pochaina, the enormous secondhand book
  market in Kyiv, business is not very brisk. It is certainly the place to go if
  you want to buy books in Russian – although maybe not if you want to sell
  them. In one corner, there is what one secondhand bookseller, Dmytro Drobin,
  called “an Egyptian pyramid” of books that no one can sell – mainly
  Russian-language, Soviet editions of everything from Tolstoy and Chekhov to
  popular fiction and Stendhal translations. Another bookseller, who preferred
  not to give her name, sells secondhand and antiquarian books in Ukrainian and
  Russian. She said the choice of language was largely determined by generation.
  “Young people mostly want to read in Ukrainian,” she said. When people offer
  her Russian books to buy, she rarely takes them: demand is down. Occasionally,
  she said, customers ask for “new books published in Russia. There are very,
  very few of these people.” From 2016, importing books from Russia has been
  restricted, requiring a permit, and since 2023 it has been outlawed. Dmytro
  Drobin, a bookseller surrounded in his shop by thousands of Russian-language
  books, said he believed his government is pursuing “forced Ukrainianisation”.
  He compared the climate to the situation under the Tsarist empire, when
  publishing books in Ukrainian was severely restricted. Russian-language books
  by Ukrainian authors may be published, but, since 2023, are ineligible for
  state grants. Since 2023, books by Russian citizens may not be published.
  Ukrainian is the sole official language of the country, but Russian remains
  widely spoken; minority languages include Crimean Tatar. Business was slow,
  said Drobin. He attributed that to the millions of Ukrainians who have left
  the country, to the numbers in the army, and the hard economic times caused by
  the war. “The very nature of reading has collapsed,” he said. In a
  Ukrainian-language bookshop in a southern suburb of Kyiv, on the city’s left
  bank, the mood was more upbeat. Alpaca, a world away from the new hipster
  bookshops of central Kyiv, sells mostly children’s books. It has been offering
  customers a deal: if they bring in unwanted Russian books, they can get
  discounts of 20-30% on new books to buy from the shop. Any extra funds gleaned
  by the shop from selling the Russian titles for recycling are donated to the
  Ukrainian armed forces. “I wanted to give people the opportunity to get rid of
  their stocks of old books that are just lying around. You can’t give them
  away, you can’t sell them, it’s a shame that they are just lying there,” said
  the store’s manager, Maryna Medvedeva. She and her colleagues had brought
  their own Russian books to the scheme. “I’m not sorry. I was going to keep
  [some Russian books], but then I opened one, I thought I’d read it – but no, I
  can’t, it’s just a feeling of repulsion.” Yulliia Kavun was shopping in the
  store with her young son, Myron. Her family was displaced from the city of
  Kostiantynivka in the eastern Donetsk region after the Russian-backed takeover
  of parts of the region in 2014. The bulk of their home library – in Russian,
  the family language – was definitively destroyed along with their house on 26
  February this year. Now she was contemplating taking advantage of Alpaca’s
  scheme to help buy the books needed for Myron’s education. For Kavun, choices
  about books reflect a necessary accommodation to her unenviable circumstances
  as a refugee. She planned, she said, to go to Poland, where her graduate
  daughter is already living – but that will require yet another linguistic and
  literary shift. “We are nobody here, and in Poland we are nobody either. So
  what’s the difference? We might as well just go there. So we’ll have to buy
  Polish books, once we are there.”
