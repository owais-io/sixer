  You can mute – but you can never leave. Why have WhatsApp groups become so
  stressful? | Polly Hudson

  It’s the new last taboo. Officially added to the list of topics you absolutely
  must not discuss, along with politics, money and religion: the WhatsApp side
  group. Apparently nobody told Melanie C from the Spice Girls though, because
  she has just revealed far too much about theirs. “There are subgroups within
  the group,” she told the Sydney Morning Herald’s Sunday Life magazine. “I
  definitely know there is a chat group that doesn’t contain me, but somewhere
  else we keep Ginger or Posh out.” Staying up to date with your side chats –
  not least ensuring each message you send doesn’t go on the wrong thread – is
  the most anxiety-ridden full-time job most of us have ever had. A friend of
  mine has a group with five mums from her daughter’s class, and another
  whittled down to four of them, then more with three, two and one. How she
  keeps track without the use of a murder investigation board with red strings
  pinned to photographs is genuinely a mystery. The latest data tells us what we
  already knew: WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world with
  more than 3 billion monthly active users. I think at this point I’m in a group
  with all of them. There’s no faster, easier, more convenient way of staying in
  touch and making arrangements – and that’s the problem. It’s so quick and
  simple to set up a group that any social situation including more than two
  participants seems to result in one being formed. Often the conversation goes
  on, whether out of desire or politeness, long after the event has passed. This
  method of interacting can lead you down some ludicrous avenues, such as the
  recent debate I found myself in about whether “hearting” an invitation means
  you’re simply thanking the person for their kind offer or formally accepting
  it in a legally binding manner. (For the record, it’s the former, right?)
  Complicating matters further is that we’re not only in groups with our mates,
  but also those we know only barely, or sometimes not at all. I’m on a local
  WhatsApp group, formed to support quarantining neighbours in 2020, that’s now
  a forum for questions that could have been Googled, passive-aggressive
  comments, and generous offers of free furniture people can’t be bothered to
  take to the tip. It’s filled with characters I’ve mostly never met but feel
  intimately acquainted with, and I have several side groups with friends on my
  road discussing the more controversial posts. Even the profile picture is
  divisive – one member’s cat, Daisy, who half the street love and enjoy sharing
  sightings of, and the other half (secretly) hate because she defecates on
  their doorsteps. Recently a newcomer who’d left his back door open in the hot
  weather reported that Daisy had strolled into his house and started eating his
  dinner, with photographs to prove it. My phone got so hot through side-chat
  action I was worried it might explode. Worth it. It’s fast becoming second
  nature to double check that each message is being put on the correct thread
  before posting, like the modern equivalent of the adage “measure twice because
  you can only cut once”. Deleting, even if you’re so lightning quick nobody had
  yet read it, leaves a notification that’s such a clear admission of guilt you
  may as well have not bothered. Imagine what everyone would be saying in the
  side chats about you then! I took a vow of silence on our school chat when a
  fellow mum’s husband read ours over her shoulder and observed sagely: “No one
  comes out of this looking good, do they?” Legend has it that another class has
  a note pinned to the top of their group with the rules that must be abided by
  within, including, “No LOLs.” The author’s ears must have been warmer than my
  phone the day she typed that. And anyway, there’s only one real law when it
  comes to WhatsApp groups and subgroups – muting the thread is fine, but
  actually exiting is not the done thing. Whatever you preface your farewell
  with, those you leave behind will get the message “*Your name* has left the
  group”, with all the hair flicking and flouncing out that implies.
  Etiquette-wise, it’s a no. You’ve made/been added without consent to your
  WhatsApp bed, and now you will lie in it for the rest of your life. A la the
  Hotel California, you can check out any time you like, but you can never
  leave.
