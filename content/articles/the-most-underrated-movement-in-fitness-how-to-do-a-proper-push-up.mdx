  If you want to show off how fit you are, you drop and do push-ups. That’s what
  happens on TV, anyway. In Top Gun: Maverick, buff fighter pilots do hundreds
  of push-ups on a hot tarmac. In the late 90s, Demi Moore wowed audiences by
  doing one-armed push-ups in the movie GI Jane, then again on David Letterman.
  Once, Michelle Obama and Ellen DeGeneres competed to see who could do the most
  push-ups (Obama won). Are push-ups really worth the hype? According to fitness
  experts, absolutely. “In my opinion, push-ups are one of the most underrated
  movements in fitness,” says Dr Andrew Jagim, director of sports medicine
  research at the Mayo Clinic Health System. Jagim says they are often
  overlooked because they seem basic, but if you practice them regularly, over
  time, you’ll likely notice improvements in upper body strength, as well as
  “posture, core control and overall athleticism”. Push-ups can be a good way to
  assess one’s general fitness. “I’ve learned that how well someone can perform
  a push-up tells me a lot about their overall movement quality,” says Mark
  Bohannon, chief experience officer and personal trainer at Ultimate
  Performance. They also cost no money and can be done just about anywhere.
  Here’s what you need to know about how to start doing push-ups correctly. How
  do you do a push-up? Push-ups require significant upper body strength, but
  really they are a full body exercise. Begin in a plank position, with your
  hands and toes on the ground. Hands should be placed slightly outside shoulder
  width, says Bohannon, with fingers spread and facing forward. Feet can be set
  wide or narrow – the closer they are, the more challenging the push-up will
  be, says Joslyn Thompson Rule, Peloton tread and strength instructor. “The
  wider your feet are, the more stable your base,” she explains. In this
  position, you activate chest, shoulder and arm muscles, and also your core
  muscles and glutes. “The push-up requires full-body stabilization,” says
  Bohannon. Lower yourself until your body is almost touching the ground,
  keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle. Then push yourself back up. “Think
  of the push-up as a moving plank,” says Bohannon. “Your body should maintain
  one unbroken line from the crown of your head to your heels.” What are some
  common mistakes? One of the most common mistakes people make during a push-up
  is not maintaining that line from head to heels. Jagim says he often sees
  people “letting their hips sag” and “letting the head drop”. (This happens to
  describe every push-up I’ve ever done.) To prevent this kind of cooked
  spaghetti push-up, brace your core – “as if someone is about to punch you in
  the stomach”, Bohannon says – and squeeze your glutes. Jagim says another
  common mistake he sees is people “rushing through reps with poor control
  and/or just dropping to the ground and pushing [themselves] back up”. Speed
  doesn’t equal effectiveness, he says. Instead, he suggests aiming for slow,
  controlled repetitions with proper alignment. This will “maximize muscle
  engagement and time under tension, and reduce injury risk”, he says. Are there
  different push-up variations? If you can’t do a push-up with proper form,
  don’t worry – you’re far from alone, and there are alternatives. Bohannon says
  when he works with clients on push-ups, he often has to “regress” back to a
  beginner level to ensure people have the proper form. If you have never done
  the exercise before, start with wall push-ups. Stand arm’s length from the
  wall, then put your hands on the wall and do a push-up with correct form: the
  body in a straight line, core braced, glutes tight and arms bending at a
  45-degree angle. Once you’ve mastered this, you could progress to doing
  push-ups with your hands on a bench, or with your hands and knees on the
  ground to reduce the load on your muscles. More from How to start: How to
  start meditating How to start weightlifting How to start budgeting How to
  start running As you build strength, you can make them more challenging, says
  Jagim. He suggests progressing to decline push-ups (where your feet are
  elevated on a box or another stable surface), tricep push-ups (where you keep
  your hands narrow and elbows tucked close to your body as you descend) or
  adding weight, like a weight plate, on your back. How do you incorporate
  push-ups into your fitness routine? Learning how to do push-ups doesn’t have
  to consume your life. Rule says she likes to think of push-ups as “a skill
  that you could spend three to five minutes working on at the start or end of
  your workout, twice a week”. To start, she suggests building up your strength
  in a plank position: hold a plank for 30 to 60 seconds, three to four times.
  Once that feels comfortable, Rule suggests trying negative push-ups. Start in
  plank position, and slowly lower down in a controlled way, building up to a
  10-second lowering before pushing back up. Repeat this three to four times.
  After that feels good, she recommends trying isometric holds – lowering down
  to a challenging position, and holding for three to five seconds. Do this for
  a few holds with as much rest time in between as you need. Performing these
  variations elevated – say, with your hands on a bench – can be a good way to
  maintain form and build strength when you’re starting, Rule says. Is there
  anyone who should avoid doing push-ups? “If you have any kind of shoulder
  impingement or injury, push-ups will aggravate it, so it’s best to avoid,”
  says Rule. Others may need modifications, especially those with injuries.
  Push-up handles – these look like pull handles you place on the floor – can be
  helpful, he says, as they reduce wrist strain and keep shoulders in a more
  stable position. And if in doubt, ask a personal trainer how to do push-ups
  safely for your body. If you hate push-ups, what can you do instead? If you
  absolutely can’t stand push-ups (maybe they evoke bad memories of the
  presidential fitness test), there are alternatives. But Bohannon says it’s
  worth asking yourself why you hate them. “Most exercise hatred stems from
  repeated failure or poor instruction,” he says. “If we can regress to the
  right movement level, improve the quality over time and appropriately
  progress, the hatred often disappears.” That said, he adds, exercises like
  dumbbell bench presses and machine chest presses can act as alternatives that
  target many of the same upper body muscles that push-ups do. But they’re not
  nearly as effective as full body workouts: “We are losing the extra stability
  challenges that make push-ups such a valuable exercise,” Bohannon says.
