  When Tabytha Gonzalez’s brother died earlier this year, her Black transgender
  community rallied around her to “take care of what I needed to get through
  this process of grief”, she said. The mutual aid collective Black Trans Travel
  Fund provided her with $250 to buy an outfit, pay for a car service from New
  York City to New Jersey for the funeral and to purchase food while she was
  there. “I was able to get what I needed to get there, I was able to have
  water, I was able to buy things; my basic needs were met in that moment,”
  Gonzalez said. “Funerals are expensive. It helped me … show up in a way that
  was respectful.” Founded in 2019, Black Trans Travel Fund began as a ride
  program for Black trans people in New York and New Jersey to pay for car
  services such as Lyft twice a week. It has since expanded to a global funding
  source for people who need help paying for TSA pre-check, flights, passports
  and emergencies, with an eye toward self autonomy so that trans people have a
  say in how they spend the money. Safe transportation is of particular
  importance to the Black trans community, since they’re at increased risk for
  harassment and violence when cycling, walking or using public transit. At
  least 32 trans and gender nonconforming people were killed in 2024, with 56%
  of them being Black trans women, according to the Human Rights Campaign. But
  Black Trans Travel Fund is strapped for resources since individual donations
  have declined in recent months due to fear around the Trump administration’s
  policies targeting trans people, said the group’s founder and co-director
  Devin Michael Lowe. “With the political climate that we’re in, the cost of
  food is skyrocketing, housing costs have skyrocketed,” Lowe told the Guardian.
  “And there’s been so much backlash against trans people all across the
  country.” Over the past year, the group has had to adjust its programs in the
  face of an increasingly anti-trans political climate. Following Trump’s
  executive order that only two sexes, male and female, would be recognized by
  the government, several transgender people told Lowe that the US Department of
  State confiscated their passports when they tried to renew them. So in
  February, the group paused its sponsorship of passports and plane tickets to
  avoid putting trans people in further danger. Following a June preliminary
  injunction on the Trump administration’s policy requiring that a person’s
  passport reflect their sex assigned at birth, though, the organization
  recently began sponsoring passports again for trans women in the US. And due
  to the US’s cuts to foreign aid and development assistance, the group has
  focused much of its efforts on helping Black trans women in other nations,
  including Uganda, seek safety. “People have had some really serious concerns
  about their capacity to travel lately,” Lowe said. Trans women who need to
  travel for work “have concerns about facing harassment at the airport, or not
  getting their documents”. Lowe said that for transgender people preparing to
  travel, their “mental health is being impacted deeply. People are stressed out
  about what are going to be the continued effects.” Trump’s recent executive
  orders targeting trans people, “really has us in a whirlwind”, Lowe said. “And
  I think that is one of the tactics. Fascism makes it difficult for you to do
  anything. They want us to be overwhelmed by the amount of things that are
  happening at once, and it feels undefeatable.” ‘Changing the lives of Black
  trans women and men’ Launched by Lowe, a Black trans man in the Bronx
  neighborhood of New York City, the Black Trans Travel Fund was originally
  created as a way to safely transport Black trans women to and from Pride
  events six years ago. In May 2019, three Black trans women – Muhlaysia Booker,
  Claire Legato, and Tamika Washington – were fatally shot in the span of a
  week. Lowe attended a rally in New York City about the murders affecting his
  community, in which he said white politicians paid “lip service” about the
  need to combat the violence without taking any action. So Lowe decided to take
  matters into his own hands by soliciting donations through social media,
  resulting in him raising $20,000 within a few weeks. “One of the core values
  of Black Trans Travel Fund is autonomy over what they’re doing,” Lowe said. “I
  can’t tell you the amount of times that a woman has told me her experience of
  getting assaulted or harassed on the metro. So I wanted to ensure that when
  people are receiving support, they’re able to utilize it in a way that feels
  safest for them.” According to the Black Trans Travel Fund, the team utilized
  more than $385,000 over five years to allow hundreds of people to pay for Uber
  rides, train tickets or gas for their friends’ cars through their bi-weekly
  ride sponsorship program. The flagship ride program was paused in 2024 due to
  a loss of funding. But with additional resources, Lowe and his team hope to
  restart it in the future. Altogether, Lowe said that the organization has
  donated more than $730,000 to help people around the world with travel,
  housing and medical costs since its inception. The group recently launched a
  $500,000 fundraising campaign to increase their mutual aid efforts and to make
  traveling more accessible for even more Black trans women. In the face of
  limited budget cuts and executive orders, the fund has pivoted its focus to
  providing emergency support to trans women globally, where applicants receive
  $200 within a couple of days to leave abusive environments, to cover funeral
  arrangement costs, or to pay for safe transportation to medical appointments.
  In recent months, the Black Trans Travel Fund has received emergency requests
  from people throughout the world who need access to HIV medication due to the
  Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID, a governmental agency that
  provided foreign aid and development assistance. “We really do not
  discriminate to the best of our ability,” Lowe said. “We have a limited amount
  of funding each month, so if we do receive an overwhelming number of requests
  we will try to prioritize the ones that feel the most urgent.” The
  organization has also focused its efforts on a grant program to support Black
  trans-led organizations and shelter spaces domestically and internationally.
  Over the past year, the group has provided 11 organizations with nearly
  $16,000. Some of the funding has gone toward rent, food, transportation and
  hygiene supplies for Black trans people affected by HIV and Aids at Devin’s
  House of Hope, a shelter in Uganda named after Lowe. In Uganda, where an
  anti-LGBTQ+ law passed two years ago, trans people are arrested, detained and
  extorted for money by authorities. The harsh political climate has led to
  harassment and discrimination on the streets, Lowe said, and it’s difficult
  for trans people to rent housing. “Even though trans people [in the US] are
  navigating homelessness and joblessness as well, there are more protections
  here legally in terms of us at least being able to apply to housing if you
  have the money,” Lowe said, “Whereas a lot of folks internationally are
  getting kicked out for ‘homosexual behavior’, like neighbors will tell
  people’s landlords.” The Black Trans Travel Fund helped Ruthra Lubega, a Black
  trans man from Kampala, Uganda, escape from the nation and seek asylum in New
  York last year. Lubega met Lowe at a meeting of LGBTQ+ leaders in Nairobi,
  Kenya, in 2022. At the time, Lubega was homeless, and wanted to create a
  shelter for trans people living with HIV/Aids. Later that year, the Black
  Trans Travel Fund raised funds for rent and bedding supplies to launch Devin’s
  House of Hope, where more than 180 trans people from throughout Africa have
  sought safety. The travel fund has also helped the shelter purchase a car and
  a motorbike for Lubega to distribute HIV medication and condoms throughout the
  community. “During my work and advocacy I used to face many challenges,”
  Lubega told the Guardian. “I was in prison many times because of my gender
  identity. I was beaten many times.” Then last summer, Lubega said that his
  photo appeared in a Ugandan newspaper’s list of “top human rights defenders
  that recruit young women to homosexuality”. Lubega’s life was at risk due to
  the anti-LGBTQ+ law, so the Black Trans Travel Fund raised money for him to
  fly to New York. Now, Lubega lives in a New York shelter and is trying to
  attain his green card as he continues to run Devin’s House of Hope from afar.
  Lubega said that ever since he learned of Black Trans Travel Fund, “they have
  done a great job of changing the lives of Black trans women and men in
  Uganda.” In the face of global trans misogynoir, the Black Trans Travel Fund
  team also sponsors events for their community to celebrate their lives and
  experience joy. The group is now raising money to provide trans women with
  funding for rides following a Black trans women cookout at New York City’s
  Socrates Sculpture Park on 24 August. And at in the fall, they plan to host a
  fundraising event to raise money for a ball in Kingston, Jamaica, in November.
