  A state of emergency has been declared in New York City and New Jersey as a
  powerful storm system hits the US east coast from New York to Washington DC,
  with dangerous torrential rainfall and flash flooding under way in the region.
  Forecasters had predicted intense rainfall, with rates possibly reaching up to
  3 inches an hour and some isolated locations could see as much as 5 to 8
  inches. New York City officials warned that heavy rain could flood some
  streets, parts of the subway and basements. They urged people living in
  basements to move to higher floors and issued an advisory asking New Yorkers
  to avoid travel from Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon. The
  Clearview Expressway, a major highway in the borough of Queens, was closed in
  both directions, and at least two cars were submerged on the expressway, a law
  enforcement official told CNN. The commuter rail system into suburban Long
  Island suspended service on one of its busiest lines during rush hour. In
  Pennsylvania, the National Weather Service issued warnings for up to 3 in of
  rain in an hour and the downpour produced flooding in the streets of Reading.
  One video online showed water pouring down a city street, rising halfway up a
  parked car, and rendering a busy commercial intersection nearly impassable as
  waters rose into a car’s wheel wells. In Maryland, multiple water rescues were
  reported in communities north of Baltimore. Airports in New York, New Jersey,
  Washington and Philadelphia all reported significant weather-related flight
  delays and cancellations. Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, said she would
  be declaring a state of emergency for New York City and the surrounding
  counties. In a post on X just before 2pm, she said: “Heavy rain and potential
  flooding are expected to affect the evening commute. Employers are encouraged
  to dismiss employees early. Continue to monitor your local forecasts, and stay
  safe.” In anticipation of the severe weather, the acting New Jersey governor,
  Tahesha Way, had earlier declared a state of emergency for the state,
  effective from 2pm on Thursday. The declarations come amid concerns over
  flooding, strong thunderstorms, heavy rainfall and gusty winds. “Beginning
  this afternoon, we are expecting severe thunderstorms to bring heavy rainfall
  and damaging wind gusts with the potential for flash flooding across the
  state,” said Way. “I urge all New Jerseyans to remain alert, follow all safety
  protocols, and monitor the proper channels for the duration of these storms.
  Residents should remain off the roads and indoors unless absolutely
  necessary.” Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s governor, posted on social media that
  state emergency management officials were preparing potential response and
  recovery efforts. The combination of saturated ground and intense downpours
  raises the risk of hazardous conditions such as flash floods, rock slides and
  landslides. Officials warned that travel could become dangerous, especially
  during the evening commute, when the heaviest rain is expected. Storm activity
  could continue well into the night. The weather service also issued flash
  flood warnings early on Thursday afternoon for parts of Pennsylvania and
  northern Maryland, portions of New York City as well as some areas in northern
  New Jersey. Washington and Baltimore could see some of the most intense rain,
  with flash flood warnings issued for parts of the area through the evening. A
  severe thunderstorm watch was in place until 8pm for an area that includes
  Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City. By Thursday night,
  flash flood and severe thunderstorm warnings were lifted in New York City. New
  York City issued a travel advisory for both Thursday and Friday, and a flood
  watch will go into effect on Thursday afternoon. “Be prepared for a serious
  storm,” the mayor, Eric Adams, said in a social media post. “Avoid traveling
  if you can, and set up any flood prevention tools in advance,” he added.
  Zachary Iscol, commissioner of New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM),
  also warned those in the area that the storm system “could bring intense
  rainfall rates and amounts in a very short period of time”. He added that the
  NYCEM had already activated the flash flood emergency plan. It comes just two
  weeks after intense rain storms hit parts of the north-eastern US, flooding
  New York City subways and resulting in two deaths in New Jersey.
