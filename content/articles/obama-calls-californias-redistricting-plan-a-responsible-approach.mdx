  Barack Obama waded into states’ efforts at rare mid-decade redistricting
  efforts, saying he agreed with California governor Gavin Newsom’s plan to
  counter the new Texas congressional map by launching an effort to redraw his
  own state’s map and create more Democratic-friendly districts, calling it “a
  responsible approach”. “I believe that governor Newsom’s approach is a
  responsible approach. He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going
  to try to completely maximize it,” Obama said at a Tuesday fundraiser on
  Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. “We’re only going to do it if and when
  Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these maneuvers. Otherwise,
  this doesn’t go into effect.” Obama also called Newsom’s strategy “measured”,
  as it only temporarily grants the California legislature the ability to redraw
  maps mid-decade. While noting that “political gerrymandering” is not his
  “preference,” Obama said that, if Democrats “don’t respond effectively, then
  this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the
  country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this
  idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy”. According to organizers, the event
  raised $2m for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and its
  affiliates, one of which has filed and supported litigation in several states
  over Republican-drawn districts. The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and
  Eric Holder, who served as Obama’s attorney general and heads up the group,
  also appeared. The former president’s comments come as Texas lawmakers
  approved a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts, passing a new
  map on Wednesday that fulfills Donald Trump’s desire to tilt the US House map
  in his favor before the 2026 midterm elections. The vote was 88 in favor and
  52 against. The map could give Republicans five new House seats in 2026 and
  took more than two weeks to pass, after Democratic state lawmakers staged a
  walkout over what they described as a “a power grab”. Several legislators
  traveled to states run by Democrats, and the protest ultimately set the stage
  for a redistricting battle now playing out across the country. Spurred on by
  the Texas situation, Democratic governors including Newsom have pondered ways
  to possibly strengthen their party’s position by way of redrawing US House
  district lines, five years out from the census count that typically leads into
  such procedures. In California – where voters in 2010 gave the power to draw
  congressional maps to an independent commission, with the goal of making the
  process less partisan – Democrats have unveiled a proposal that could give
  that state’s dominant political party an additional five US House seats in a
  bid to win the fight to control Congress next year. If approved by voters in
  November, the blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the
  nation’s most populous state, with Democrats intending to win the party 48 of
  its 52 US House seats, up from 43. A hearing over that measure devolved into a
  shouting match Tuesday as a Republican lawmaker clashed with Democrats, and a
  committee voted along party lines to advance the new congressional map.
  California Democrats do not need any Republican votes to move ahead, and
  legislators are expected to approve a proposed congressional map and declare a
  4 November special election by Thursday to get required voter approval. Newsom
  and Democratic leaders say they’ll ask voters to approve their new maps only
  for the next few elections, returning map-drawing power to the commission
  following the 2030 census – and only if a Republican state moves forward with
  new maps. Obama applauded that temporary timeline. “And we’re going to do it
  in a temporary basis because we’re keeping our eye on where we want to be long
  term,” Obama said, referencing Newsom’s take on the California plan. “I think
  that approach is a smart, measured approach, designed to address a very
  particular problem in a very particular moment in time.” The Associated Press
