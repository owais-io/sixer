  Often romantically linked to women much younger than himself, Leonardo
  DiCaprio may have hinted at why the age gap is of no significance to him as he
  reflects on turning 50. The Hollywood star of films including Titanic and The
  Wolf of Wall Street claims he feels as if he is only in his early 30s. He was
  asked by the US film-maker Paul Thomas Anderson: “You’re going to answer as
  quickly as you can. If you didn’t know how old you are, how old are you right
  now?” DiCaprio responded: “Thirty-two.” Anderson, the director of DiCaprio’s
  latest action thriller, One Battle After Another, which is released in the UK
  next month, asked him to reflect on his milestone birthday, which he
  celebrated in November. The actor said: “Well, it creates a feeling like you
  have a desire to just be more honest and not waste your time. I can only
  imagine how the next few decades are going to progress. I look at my mother,
  for example, and she just says exactly what she thinks and wastes no time. She
  spends no time trying to fake it.” He added: “Being more upfront and risking
  having things fall apart or risk the disagreements or risk going your separate
  ways from any type of relationship in life – the personal, professional – it’s
  that you just don’t want to waste your time any more. “You have to just be
  much more upfront. It’s almost a responsibility because much more of your life
  is behind you than it is ahead of you.” In the interview, for Esquire
  magazine, DiCaprio explained how he avoided getting the blues after filming.
  “I think I’m good at it because I take a lot of time off between films,” he
  said. “I do things more sparingly, which means you’re anxious to get back to
  your real life once you’ve finished filming. Life goes on hold when you’re
  filming. Everything stops and gets put on the back burner in your real life.
  “I might be more concerned if I worked too much. To go from film to film, I
  would be scared about: what do I have to come back to? I’m very fortunate for
  that.” DiCaprio made his film debut in 1991 and has received numerous awards
  including a best actor Oscar and a Bafta for his role in 2015’s The Revenant.
  He said his biggest regret was not doing Boogie Nights, another of Anderson’s
  films. Of his old films, DiCaprio said: “I rarely watch any of my films, but
  if I’m being honest there is one that I’ve watched more than others. It’s The
  Aviator. That’s simply because it was such a special moment to me. “I had
  worked with Marty [Martin Scorsese] on Gangs of New York and I’d been toting
  around a book on Howard Hughes for 10 years. I almost did it with Michael Mann
  but there was a conflict and I ended up bringing it to Marty. I was 30. It was
  the first time as an actor I got to feel implicitly part of the production,
  rather than just an actor hired to play a role. “I felt responsible in a whole
  new way. I’ve always felt proud and connected to that film as such a key part
  of my growing up in this industry and taking on a role of a real collaborator
  for the first time.” The full interview is in Esquire UK’s autumn issue, out
  on 14 August.
