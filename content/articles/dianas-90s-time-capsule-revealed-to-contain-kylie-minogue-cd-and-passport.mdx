  More than 30 years after it was buried, a time capsule compiled by Diana,
  Princess of Wales and two children to represent life in the 1990s has been
  opened prematurely – revealing a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator
  and a passport. The lead-encased wooden box was sealed in 1991 to mark the
  laying of the foundation stone of Great Ormond Street hospital’s Variety Club
  building, which opened in 1994 to replace outdated buildings and clinical
  facilities. Two children selected 10 items to represent life in the 90s, after
  winning a Blue Peter competition. Other objects included a pocket TV, a
  snowflake hologram and a photo of Diana. The time capsule was intended to be
  unearthed in “hundreds of years” but was dug up to make way for the
  construction of a children’s cancer centre. Diana became president of the
  children’s hospital in 1989 and visited it several times before her death in
  1997. She helped the two children select the items to be placed in the time
  capsule. A CD of Kylie Minogue’s Rhythm of Love album was chosen by David
  Watson, then aged 11, from Paignton, Devon. He also selected a sheet of
  recycled paper and a passport. Sylvia Foulkes, then nine, from Norwich, chose
  a collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds, and the
  snowflake hologram. The box also included a copy of the Times from the date of
  the capsule’s burial. Headlines on its front page include: “Cooked meats bring
  out Soviet voters in droves”, alongside a photo of the former Soviet leader
  Mikhail Gorbachev, and “US rejects Iraqi warplanes plea as rebels close in”.
  Images released by archivists show some damage to the objects, but they are
  largely intact. The burial of the time capsule was similar to a ceremony in
  1872 during which the then Princess of Wales, Alexandra, laid a foundation
  stone at the hospital, also sealing a time capsule. That time capsule, which
  contained a photo of Queen Victoria, has not been found. Staff who were either
  born in 1991 or were working at the hospital in 1991 helped to remove the
  capsule before the construction of the children’s cancer centre. The centre
  will be a “national resource of the treatment of childhood cancers” and will
  help clinical teams develop “kinder, more effective treatments” for children
  staying at the hospital, a statement said. Six things that happened in 1991 •
  John Major was inaugurated British prime minister on 29 November 1990, after
  winning a contest to replace Margaret Thatcher, who had resigned after a
  challenge to her leadership. He presided over a period of economic recession
  in 1991, with high interest rates, falling housing prices and rising
  unemployment. Major remained in post until 1995, when he resigned as party
  leader after several high-profile “sleaze” scandals. The US president was the
  Republican George HW Bush. • The cold war ended with the breakup of the Soviet
  Union over the course of 1991, putting an end to decades of geopolitical
  rivalry between the US and the Soviet Union and their respective capitalist
  and communist allies. • The first Gulf war, an armed conflict between Saddam
  Hussein-governed Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the US, began with
  Operation Desert Storm, which launched an aerial bombing campaign against Iraq
  on 17 January 1991 and ended with the American-led liberation of Kuwait on 28
  February. • The British scientist Tim Berners-Lee introduced WorldWideWeb, the
  first web browser, while working at the European nuclear research agency Cern
  in Geneva. The first website went online to the general public on 6 August. •
  Seatbelts were made mandatory for all adults travelling in a car in the UK.
  Front-seat occupants had been required to wear seatbelts from 1983, and
  children in rear-seats in 1989. • Freddie Mercury died aged 45 at his home in
  London on 24 November, 24 hours after announcing he had been diagnosed with
  Aids. On 23 December, Queen’s hit single Bohemian Rhapsody returned to the top
  of the British singles chart after 16 years, with the proceeds from the
  rerelease donated to the Terence Higgins Trust which runs HIV-related services
  and campaigns to eradicate stigma and discrimination.
