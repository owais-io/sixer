  The son of a British woman who has been held in Iran since January on
  espionage charges along with her husband has called on the UK government to
  raise their case during talks with Iran reportedly taking place in Istanbul
  later this week. Lindsay and Craig Foreman, both 52, were arrested on 3
  January in Kerman, southern Iran, while travelling through the country from
  Armenia to Pakistan on a motorcycle journey to Australia. The family, who have
  not had direct contact with the couple since their incarceration, have said
  promises from the Foreign Office in the past fortnight to arrange
  conversations with the couple had not materialised. Six weeks ago, the Foreign
  Office said it did not know the couple’s whereabouts, despite initially having
  said they were being transferred to Evin prison in Tehran. Lindsay’s eldest
  son, Joe Bennett, said the family were past breaking point. “The silence is
  intolerable, inhumane and a stain on the duty of care that the British
  government owes its citizens.” “While other countries are ensuring their
  citizens’ cases are raised at the highest levels in negotiations with Iran, we
  are left shouting into the void, writing letters, running social media
  campaigns, tagging David Lammy and Keir Starmer and hearing nothing. We are
  losing faith,” said Bennett, 31. After Israel’s bombing of Tehran’s Evin
  prison on 23 June that left more than 70 dead, the family said they “endured
  unimaginable fear”, uncertain of the couple’s wellbeing. Yesterday, the family
  said they learned the couple was moved from Kerman to a location in Tehran,
  but said the British government had not confirmed their safety or wellbeing.
  The Foreign Office has been approached for comment. Renewed calls for their
  release come after nearly two weeks of war between Israel and Iran in June,
  during which the US bombed a number of Iran’s nuclear sites and brought
  nuclear talks to an abrupt end. As Iran maintains a fragile ceasefire with the
  US and Israel, the family has called on the UK government to table the
  couple’s case after learning negotiations between the UK and Iran were set to
  take place in Istanbul later this week. The UK, France and Germany – the E3,
  which signed the original nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 – reportedly met
  Iranian officials for nuclear talks in Istanbul last week, after threatening
  to reimpose “snapback” UN sanctions without the risk of a security council
  veto, so long as they act by its expiry in October. The 2015 deal does not
  allow other signatories, China or Russia, to veto the sanctions snapback, and
  since leaving the deal in 2018, the US cannot veto the UK or EU move. The
  family have also called for immediate public commitment from Lammy and
  Starmer, as well as to prioritise urgent and regular phone calls, consular
  visits and medical and legal support. It is understood the British couple have
  been visited by consular officials three times, the most recent in May, and
  have had no medical or consular visits for more than 75 days. “We cannot and
  will not remain silent while our loved ones are left to disappear into the
  shadows of bureaucracy and apathy,” said Bennett. “This is no longer just a
  diplomatic issue. It is a humanitarian emergency. The government must act now,
  before it’s too late.” Bennett said it was difficult hearing accounts from
  former detainees and not knowing the conditions in which his mother and her
  husband were being held, or whether they were still being held together. “I
  need to speak to my mum,” said Bennett. He described the ordeal as torturous
  for himself and the family. “It’s hard for me to say with 100% confidence that
  I know my mum’s alive, and it’s mental to even think to say that, but that is
  the reality, I haven’t spoken to my mum.” While drawing positivity from
  continuous setbacks was hard, said Bennett, two messages he had sent to his
  mother kept him grounded: that he was always looking for and at the moon, and
  thinking of embracing the couple on their safe return. “We’re starting to feel
  like we’re not being heard, there’s no recognition or acknowledgment of what
  we’re doing by the powers that be that can make a difference,” he added. “It’s
  like we’re screaming into the void at the moment.” On 23 July, the all-party
  parliamentary group (APPG) for arbitrary detention and hostage affairs wrote
  to the UK foreign secretary, urging the government to prioritise their case
  and take further steps to secure their release. The group’s chair, Alicia
  Kearns, who wrote to Lammy along with other MPs, told the Guardian on
  Wednesday that the government could not take part in negotiations with Iran
  without the couple’s release. The MP added that the detention of other British
  nationals in Iran such as Mehran Raoof was one of the central issues to
  negotiate. “This cannot be an afterthought while their lives are at risk.
  President [Emmanuel] Macron has publicly and strongly called for the release
  of the French nationals held hostage in Iran. It is deplorable that Keir
  Starmer and David Lammy have the opportunity to negotiate their release, and
  are not doing everything they can to take it,” said Kearns. A Foreign Office
  spokesperson said: “We are deeply concerned by reports that two British
  nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this
  case directly with the Iranian authorities. “We are providing them with
  consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.” •
