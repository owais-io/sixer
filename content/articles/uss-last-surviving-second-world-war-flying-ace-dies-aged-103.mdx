  The second world war pilot who was believed to be the US’s last surviving
  “ace” – a title he earned by shooting down five enemy combatants – has died.
  Donald McPherson was 103 when he died on 14 August, according to his online
  obituary. McPherson fought Japanese forces during the second world war’s final
  years, serving in the Pacific theater as a US navy fighter pilot aboard the
  USS Essex. He earned the Congressional Gold Medal, three Distinguished Flying
  Crosses and recognition as an “ace” fighter for his service. Pilots had to
  shoot down at least five enemies in aerial combat to be recognized as aces.
  According to both the American Fighter Aces Association and the Fagen Fighters
  WWII Museum, McPherson was listed as the US’s last living ace from the second
  world war era. McPherson’s daughter, Beth Delabar, acknowledged the attention
  paid on her father’s military accomplishments – but said he preferred to be
  known as a pious man who was dedicated to his family as well as community.
  “When it’s all done and Dad lists the things he wants to be remembered for …
  his first thing would be that he’s a man of faith,” Delabar told the Beatrice
  Daily Sun, the newspaper in McPherson’s home state of Nebraska that first
  reported his death. “It hasn’t been till these later years in his life that
  he’s had so many honors and medals.” McPherson was 18 when joined the US navy
  in 1942, after Japan’s December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. He completed an
  18-month training program before marrying his wife, Thelma, in 1944. He then
  belonged to fighter squadron VF-83, combating the Japanese in the F6F Hellcat
  planes that he flew. Once, in a Fagen Fighters WWII Museum video celebrating
  him, McPherson described how he shot down two Japanese planes in one mission.
  He said he noticed the planes converging, and he dispatched one into the ocean
  by lowering his fighter’s nose and firing. “Then I did a wingover to see what
  happened to the second one,” McPherson remarked on the video. “By using full
  throttle, my Hellcat responded well, and I squeezed the trigger and it
  exploded. Then I turned and did a lot of violent maneuver to try to get out of
  there without getting shot down.” He explained that a fellow sailor back at
  the aircraft carrier pointed out a bullet hole about a foot behind where
  McPherson had been sitting in the plane. As the Associated Press noted,
  McPherson’s daughter, Donna Mulder, interpreted that kind of experience during
  his military career as evidence that “maybe God is not done with me”.
  McPherson settled down at his family’s farm in Adams, Nebraska, after the war.
  He started youth baseball and softball leagues in Adams while accepting
  leadership positions for local institutions, including a scout troop, American
  Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars chapters and a United Methodist church
  congregation. Adams eventually named a ballfield after McPherson and Thelma,
  who preceded her husband in death and was a scorekeeper and concession stand
  worker during games there. McPherson’s funeral was on 19 August. Three days
  earlier, the Fagen Fighters WWII Museum commemorated what the organization
  called McPherson’s “amazing life” at its Victory at Sea event in Minnesota.
