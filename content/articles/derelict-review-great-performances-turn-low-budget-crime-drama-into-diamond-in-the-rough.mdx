  Derelict review – great performances turn low-budget crime drama into diamond
  in the rough
sectionName: Film

  Here is a crime drama from director-cinematographer-editor Jonathan Zaurin in
  which Abigail (Suzanne Fulton) is mourning the violent murder of her father
  while entertaining hopes of revenge against his killer. Meanwhile, two very
  different brothers navigate reconnection after one is released from prison:
  Matt (Michael Coombes), the younger brother, is a shy, soft kind of guy, while
  ex-con Ewan (Pete Bird) is confident and cocky and seemingly determined to
  head straight back down the kind of path that led to him getting banged up in
  the first place. Only this time, perhaps he’ll drag his little brother along
  for the ride. Derelict is self-evidently a low-budget affair – it reportedly
  took as little as £35k to film on location in Herefordshire, and that lack of
  resource can’t always be concealed. There are also a fair few instances of
  sequences that presumably felt realistic on the page but strike a false note
  on the screen: for example, it will never be convincing to have one actor
  stand still while yelling “come back!” as another actor walks away from them.
  It might sound pedantic but it’s the kind of thing that gives a telenovela
  feel to a film aiming for gritty realism. Some of the acting is likewise
  variable in its plausibility. But two players in particular stand out. As
  Abigail, Fulton paints a portrait of a woman who has shut down almost
  completely, while still giving us enough to go on that we stay with the
  character’s pain. And Coombes, as younger brother Matt, brings a soulful
  authenticity to a layered and original role. This is a film that you will need
  to make some allowances for – it’s clearly a labour of love and in dire need
  of a tighter edit – but there’s talent here: call it a diamond in the rough. •
  Derelict is on digital platforms from 1 September.
