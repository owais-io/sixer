  South Korea’s military has said North Korea has started dismantling some
  propaganda loudspeakers aimed at the South in parts of the border area,
  following similar moves by Seoul made in a bid to ease tensions. South Korea’s
  Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t disclose the sites where the North Koreans were
  removing speakers and said further confirmation was needed as to whether the
  dismantling was taking place across all areas, adding it would continue
  monitoring related activities. “Activities by the North Korean military
  removing loudspeakers against South Korea have been detected in parts of the
  front-line area since Saturday morning,” the military said in a notice to
  reporters on Saturday. The announcement is a rare sign of rapprochement
  between the two Koreas since President Lee Jae Myung became president in June,
  replacing conservative hardliner Yoon Suk Yeol following his short-lived
  attempt to impose martial law. Shortly after Lee took office, his
  administration switched off propaganda broadcasts criticising the North Korean
  regime as it looked to revive stalled dialogue with its neighbour. The South
  Korean military said the North stopped its broadcasts in June too. A week ago,
  South Korea then began dismantling its own speakers, which blast a mix of
  world news and information about democratic and capitalist society alongside
  K-pop music. The sound is believed to travel more than 20km (12.4 miles) into
  North Korea. Previously, South Korean border residents had complained that
  North Korean speakers blasted irritating sounds, including howling animals and
  pounding gongs, in a tit-for-tat response to South Korean propaganda
  broadcasts. North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism
  of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong-un,
  didn’t immediately confirm it was taking down its speakers. South Korea’s
  previous conservative government resumed daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June
  last year, following a years-long pause, in retaliation for North Korea flying
  rubbish-filled balloons toward the South. President Lee has taken further
  measures to improve ties with Pyongyang, urging civic groups to suspend
  distribution of leaflets criticising the North, and delaying some annual joint
  military drills with the US taking place in the coming weeks as part of the
  Ulchi Freedom Shield exercises. The two Koreas remain technically at war after
  the 1950-53 Korean war ended only in a truce, and relations have deteriorated
  in the past few years. With Reuters and Associated Press
