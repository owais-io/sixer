  Good morning. Donald Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to
  enforce a potential peace deal with Vladimir Putin, tempering a promise to
  provide Kyiv with security guarantees that European allies had called a
  significant breakthrough towards halting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Asked
  during a phone interview with Fox News whether he could assure listeners –
  including many members of his Maga base who support an isolationist
  America-first foreign policy – that the US would not put troops on the ground
  in Ukraine, Trump said: “You have my assurance, and I’m president.” He did,
  however, say Washington may be willing to provide air support to Ukraine to
  backstop a deal, in what would still be a remarkable shift in his
  administration’s policy on the conflict. Where do the talks stand? At the
  heart of Tuesday’s talks among European allies was the question of what
  security guarantees could be offered to Ukraine. On Monday, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy described security guarantees as “a key issue, a starting point
  towards ending the war” and he appreciated Trump’s indication that the US was
  ready to be part of that guarantee. Republicans sue to block Newsom’s
  fast-track California redistricting plan Republican state legislators in
  California filed a suit on Tuesday to block a mid-year redistricting plan
  meant to counter Texas’s effort to redraw congressional district lines. The
  emergency petition argues that the process being used in the California
  assembly violates laws requiring a 30-day period between the introduction of
  legislation and voting on it. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, announced
  his state’s redistricting plan last week in terms on social media mocking
  Trump, intent on using the voting power of the US’s most populous state to
  counteract Texas’s redrawn map, which would be expected to deliver a net gain
  of five congressional seats to Republicans in 2026. Which law firm have
  Republicans chosen? The Mandeep Dhillon law firm filing the suit was
  previously owned by Harmeet Dhillon, who is now assistant attorney general
  overseeing the Department of Justice civil rights division. Dhillon was known
  for her efforts to sue California’s university system to overturn policies
  which barred controversial conservative speakers from appearing. Microsoft
  workers occupy HQ in protest against company’s ties to Israeli military Dozens
  of Microsoft employees occupied the company’s east campus in Redmond,
  Washington, to protest against what they say is the use of its software by the
  Israeli military to carry out operations in Gaza and enable the surveillance
  of Palestinians. Less than a week after the company said it was launching an
  independent investigation into the use of its Azure software, current and
  former staff occupied a space they declared the “Free Zone”, holding placards
  that read “Join the worker intifada – no labor for genocide” and “Martyred
  Palestinian children’s plaza”. The protests, organised by the No Azure for
  Genocide group, has demanded Microsoft divest from Israel. What’s the
  background? This month, the Guardian and Israel’s +972 Magazine revealed
  Israel’s military surveillance agency, Unit 8200, was making use of Microsoft
  Azure to store countless recordings of mobile phone calls made by Palestinians
  living in the West Bank and Gaza. According to three Unit 8200 sources, the
  cloud-based storage platform has facilitated the preparation of deadly
  airstrikes and has shaped military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The
  company said it was not aware “of the surveillance of civilians or collection
  of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft’s services”. In other news …
  Hurricane Erin remained far out at sea on Tuesday, yet was still producing
  huge swells, with waves towering 20ft (6 meters) or more and crashing across
  sand dunes along North Carolina’s barrier islands. Israel has said it will
  deliver its response to international mediators by Friday over a new Gaza
  ceasefire plan accepted by Hamas, amid mounting pressure for a truce after
  more than 62,000 Palestinians killed. A speechwriter for the Trump
  administration’s Department of Homeland Security has been linked to hate
  speech online. Eric Lendrum compared the experience of US conservatives to
  that of enslaved people and Jewish people in Nazi Germany. The actor Aubrey
  Plaza spoke about the death of her husband, Jeff Baena, who took his own life
  in January, saying it’s “a daily struggle, obviously”. Stat of the day: Health
  groups warn of spiralling Somalian diphtheria cases, with children more than
  97% of cases Cases of diphtheria, a potentially deadly bacterial disease
  mainly affecting children, are rapidly increasing across Somalia, experts have
  warned. Doctors Without Borders said the rise is partly due to lack of
  vaccination coverage. The Demartino public hospital in the capital, Mogadishu,
  said 42 people had died so far this month. Somalian healthcare has also been
  affected by cuts to USAID. Don’t miss this: The boy who saw some unclaimed
  land – and founded his own country Daniel Jackson was just 14 when he and his
  friends saw a strip of forest between Serbia and Croatia, and decided to claim
  it. Now 20, he is the president of the Free Republic of Verdis, but has been
  forced to live in exile in the UK. “The world is boring without trying
  something crazy,” he said. Climate check: Wildfire smoke far more dangerous to
  health than thought, study says Smoke spewed by wildfire is far more dangerous
  than previously thought, a study has found, with death tolls from short-term
  exposure to fine particulates underestimated by 93%. Researchers found that
  535 people in Europe died on average each year between 2004 and 2022 as a
  result of breathing the toxic particles. Last Thing: Swedish town begins to
  roll historic building 5km After eight years of planning and an estimated cost
  of 500m kronor ($52m), a church in northern Sweden began a 5km (3-mile)
  journey yesterday to make way for the expansion of Europe’s biggest
  underground mine. Eventually, the whole town of Kiruna will be moved. Sign up
