  A Florida man who fatally stabbed a friend during an argument in 2022 over
  Donald Trump’s businesses having gone bankrupt, is facing possibly spending
  the rest of his life in prison after being convicted of murder. Donald
  Jamesbrown Henry, 38, awaits a sentencing hearing tentatively scheduled for
  October after jurors found him guilty on Friday of second-degree murder in the
  killing of Shawn Popp, whose death came to be regarded by some as an example
  of the havoc that politics can wreak on interpersonal relationships in the US.
  Henry’s conviction, under Florida law, requires him to serve at least 16 years
  and nine months in prison without the possibility of parole. The state’s
  maximum punishment for second-degree murder is life imprisonment. According to
  authorities, Popp was smoking marijuana at a friend’s house in the community
  of Arcadia on 22 October 2022 when he and Henry – another visitor – became
  locked into an argument about Trump, who at the time was a fellow Florida
  resident in between his two presidencies. Popp made a statement about “Trump
  going bankrupt”, investigators wrote in a sworn statement that was later filed
  in court and reported on by Reuters. Henry, meanwhile, “strongly believed that
  Donald Trump did not go bankrupt but instead … chose the wrong individuals to
  do business with, which caused it to fail”, investigators wrote. A number of
  businesses that Trump ran before winning the 2016 and 2024 presidential races
  sought federal bankruptcy protection, and it was not clear whether the
  argument between Popp and Henry focused on any particular one of those cases.
  Regardless, the two ended up fighting, with Henry convinced Popp “was talking
  to him like he was stupid”, authorities alleged. Investigators said Henry then
  plunged the blade of a kitchen knife that he was sharpening into Popp’s chest.
  Popp subsequently walked outside, crossed the street and collapsed dead after
  being overheard remarking, “You stabbed me, you son of a bitch,” the news
  website Law &amp; Crime reported. Once the local sheriff’s office was called
  out to investigate, Henry claimed he had acted in self-defense and therefore
  had justifiably killed Popp. Henry maintained that fists were “deadly weapons”
  and he had first been struck in the face by Popp, prompting him to use the
  knife and “stop the threat”, deputies wrote in their sworn statement. Deputies
  also accused Henry of explaining that his family members were high-ranking
  military members – and of saying that prior “training” he had received in
  survival and weapons “kicked in” during the fracas. Though Henry had
  “superficial marks” on his forehead, investigators said they determined he did
  not have any injuries demonstrating that he needed to defend himself with
  deadly force. They jailed Henry – and on Friday, after brief jury
  deliberations at the conclusion of his trial, jurors returned a verdict
  finding him guilty of murder as well as trying to intimidate a witness out of
  cooperating with authorities, a statement from the DeSoto county sheriff’s
  office said. “This verdict is a testament to the dedication and hard work of
  [law enforcement] who never stopped pursuing justice,” the sheriff’s office
  statement added. • This article was amended on 19 August 2025 to refer to
  Donald Trump’s presidential election wins in 2016 and 2024, not 2016 and 2020.
