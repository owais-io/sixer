  Wig, robes and moves like Jagger. Rosamund Pike’s star turn as a crown court
  judge, at the National Theatre in London, has proved that there’s just one
  prop you need to turn even the most serious of subjects into a punk
  performance – a microphone. And Inter Alia is only the latest in a number of
  major openings to star the humble handheld: from Greek tragedy to Chekhov, the
  device seems to be increasingly common in West End productions. Microphones
  were integral to Thomas Ostermeier’s meta-theatrical production of The Seagull
  at the Barbican, and Jamie Lloyd – having used handhelds to transform James
  McAvoy into a rapping Cyrano de Bergerac three years ago – has deployed them
  in both Shakespeare (Much Ado) and Lloyd Webber (Evita). And no production
  used them more controversially than Daniel Fish’s Elektra, whose lead, Brie
  Larson, spoke her entire part into an on-stage amp, distorting her own voice
  with a range of effects pedals. Microphones have been a source of contention
  in the theatre ever since Trevor Nunn introduced radio mics to the National in
  1999. But a handheld isn’t something a director is trying to hide, unlike the
  miniature, hands-free microphones that audiences are now used to seeing actors
  wear. “Personally I think those things that sit on the top of people’s
  foreheads, like a bug, look silly,” says Fish. “But here the microphone
  becomes an instrument, right? It’s something that the actor can play with so
  it becomes a very dynamic thing.” While it might not have been in use in
  Sophocles’ time, Fish found it a fascinating proposition in the rehearsal
  room. “Elektra is about a woman who refuses to be quiet, so the idea of
  amplifying and centring her voice felt important,” he says. “This is a person
  for whom the only power that she has, the only chance of justice, is through
  the noise she makes.” One of the memorable elements of Larson’s sonic
  performance was the way she sang, rather than spoke, the word “no” –
  highlighting just how many times it appears in the play, although the punk
  sensibility did divide the critics. Or, as Fish puts it, “the show pissed a
  lot of people off”. Ostermeier enjoys the “attitude” that handheld mics can
  bring to a performance (put one in a rehearsal room, and every actor wants to
  be the one holding it). “Of course, it’s about who has the power to talk and
  who is excluded, about status and power,” says the German director, “but it’s
  also about pop culture.” Ostermeier enjoys placing theatre within the context
  of the entertainment industry it belongs to: his Seagull kicked off with an
  actor performing some Billy Bragg, then asking the audience if they were ready
  for “a little bit of Chekhov”. In that deliberately meta production, on-stage
  microphones were employed throughout to help indicate when characters were
  speaking to each other or “performing” for a wider audience. Cate Blanchett
  found it transformative for the part of Irina Arkadina, a famous actor and
  hopeless showoff: “They helped the story we wanted to tell,” says Ostermeier,
  “which is that Arkadina is completely lost in it. She doesn’t have a real
  relationship with other human beings any more without some form of media in
  between.” There is nothing new about handheld mics on stage, as all these
  directors are keen to point out: pioneers from the Wooster Group to Pina
  Bausch to Marina Abramović were using them in the 1970s. “It’s a technique
  that’s been around for a long time,” says Katie Mitchell, whose wordless,
  sonically driven work Cow | Deer arrives at the Royal Court in September.
  “I’ve always been interested in how you can amplify the spoken voice without
  having to distort your body or your voice to make it sound louder,” says
  Mitchell, who has been working with microphones for decades now (in her own
  version of The Seagull in 2006, Hattie Morahan’s Nina whispered her lines into
  one). It’s a paradox of the microphone that while it presents as performative
  and even political, it can also bring us closer to the character’s subjective
  experience. “We’re being invited into a more intimate relationship – we can
  hear their saliva, their breathing,” says Mitchell. That requires technicians
  as sensitive and responsive as the performers themselves, such as Laura
  Hammond, the sound engineer who live-mixed the scenes in Elektra. “A lot of
  times everything just goes into the computer, everything is set,” says Fish,
  “and that makes me want to pull my hair out.” For some theatre lovers, the
  current vogue for on-stage amplification is less welcome. One veteran actor in
  Ostermeier’s own company, who like so many stage actors has trained his voice
  to fill large spaces, refuses to use microphones. “He’s annoyed because it’s a
  theatrical fashion,” says the director, “and he doesn’t want to be part of
  this fashion any more.” Mitchell acknowledges the challenge microphones
  represent to the proud tradition of voice work in theatre: “There’s a sense if
  you’re not allowing actors to use all their skill for vocal projection and
  you’re just mediating it with technology, this undermines that tradition. But
  I’m always of the position that a healthy society should have a wide spectrum
  of performance modes.” As ever, there’s a danger that a popular technique
  becomes a fad, used without a sense or purpose. “It moves from innovation to
  convention to cliche awfully quickly,” admits Fish. But right now, Mitchell
  believes the age of the microphone is something to be enjoyed. “All these
  practitioners have got good political or intellectual underpinnings – let’s
  celebrate it, and not police each other. Let’s just chill.”
