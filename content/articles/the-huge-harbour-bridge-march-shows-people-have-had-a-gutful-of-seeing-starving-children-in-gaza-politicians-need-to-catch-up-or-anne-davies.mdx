  The New South Wales premier risks going down in history as the most
  conservative premier of the modern era. Renowned for his political nous, slick
  media management, urbane delivery and ability to tamp down controversy, Chris
  Minns is perennially attuned to the loud voices of the shock jocks on Sydney
  radio and in the Murdoch media. But his decision to oppose the march for
  Palestine across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday was a critical error of
  judgment – and the 100,000 or more people who braved torrential rain and wind
  to walk for those in Gaza told him so. There were women in hijabs, men in
  Palestinian scarves, families with children, older couples, unionists and tens
  of thousands of young people from all parts of Sydney. Muslims, Jews and
  Christians declared their faith with placards. The turnout, and its diversity,
  suggest people have had a gutful of the images of starving children, of
  desperate people risking their lives in a scramble for food at aid stations,
  of bombed-out buildings as far as the eye can see. They’re prepared to put
  aside their reservations about being associated with one side of the
  Israel-Palestinian conflict in the interests of humanity. If it’s not
  genocide, what’s taking place in Gaza is a mass displacement, because it’s
  hard to see how anyone, let alone children, can live in what is left of it.
  Along with the horror at what’s happening in Gaza, there was also a palpable
  sense of anger towards Minns and, to a lesser extent, the prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, over Australia’s fence-sitting. “Hey, Chris Minns – whose
  bridge? Our bridge!” protesters shouted as they marched. A placard carried on
  to the bridge also called out the premier: “Hey Minns. Walking on a bridge
  won’t starve us, but blocking aid starves Palestinians. We will survive, they
  won’t.” Another said: “Public safety concerns YES! The Palestinian public are
  not safe being starved and bombed.” Chants rippled through the crowd calling
  for Albanese to act. The legal right to protest is fundamental to the proper
  functioning of our democracy. Sometimes the institutions of government lag far
  behind public opinion – or fail to recognise the need for change. Just ask the
  suffragettes, the activists who campaigned for the right of First Nations
  peoples to vote, for marriage equality for LGBTQ+ people, or the union
  movement, which fought using protest for the eight-hour workday. In the face
  of an unfolding tragedy such as Gaza, people feel understandably powerless.
  Turning up and marching in a place that can accommodate huge numbers while
  garnering international attention is a legal and effective option to tell
  politicians they are tone deaf. Minns’ overtly pro-Israel stance and his
  natural reflex toward the conservative on this and other issues, such as pill
  testing, drug reform and the right to protest, are now rattling his own team.
  Among the state Labor MPs who defied the premier and joined the march on
  Sunday were Penny Sharpe, Jihad Dib, Lynda Voltz, Sarah Kaine and Stephen
  Lawrence, alongside the federal MPs Ed Husic, Alison Byrne and Tony Sheldon.
  Asked why he walked, Lawrence said: “It’s time for the world to act. It’s time
  for Australia to sanction Israel. The people have spoken today. They want more
  action from the Australian government to stop the genocide in Palestine.”
  Privately, some inside state Labor are querying why Minns didn’t leave it to
  the police and the courts. The premier instead weighed in against the protest
  early, egged on by conservative pro-Israel commentators. The result was a
  potential shambles. The Metro was closed for maintenance as was the eastern
  suburbs train line. There had been too little thought given to how 100,000 or
  more people might return from North Sydney, leading the police to turn around
  the massive crowd and walk them back to the city using geolocated texts and
  speakers on low-flying helicopters. It all went as well as it could, thanks to
  the goodwill of the crowd, the organisers and NSW police. But members of the
  Labor party, with its long heritage of progressive politics, human rights
  advocacy and embrace of direct action, want a serious rethink. “It’s time for
  fundamental change of position in the Labor party on the right to protest, and
  our approach to this question of Palestinian protests,” Lawrence said. “The
  last few days have shown we cannot take away the right of people to protest.
  Inconvenience occurs. It should be minimised, but public safety is the key
  thing, and that is a key reason why the right to protest must be protected.”
