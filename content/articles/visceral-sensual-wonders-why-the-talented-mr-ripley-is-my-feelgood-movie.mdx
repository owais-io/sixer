  Sixteen is a great age to see a movie, there on a threshold between wide-eyed
  wonder and something like maturity. That’s how old I was when I first laid
  eyes on The Talented Mr Ripley, Anthony Minghella’s ravishing, exquisitely
  grim 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s flinty 1955 novel. I’d been a
  movie fan for years at that point, but something about its elegant menace, its
  beauty flecked with blood, grabbed ahold of me like little had previously. It
  is by no means a feelgood film, this story of queer longing and loneliness
  giving way to murderous deed. But watching it now (as I do perhaps
  embarrassingly often) still evokes the primal thrill of art cracking open a
  young mind. Minghella, who died in 2008, was a master of style, crafting
  wholly credible visions of the past. His prowess is perhaps best on display in
  Ripley, which takes the viewer on a grand tour of mid-20th-century Italy, both
  its sun-splashed coastal languor and its more anxious, cobble-gray city
  streets. Tom Ripley, a low-birth conman sent to Europe’s blessed boot to
  retrieve a prodigal shipping scion at his father’s behest, is in awe of the
  country, as are we in the audience; so much so that we begin to sickly root
  for Tom’s increasingly sinister campaign to stay there. Gabriel Yared’s
  alternately forbidding and playful score – its seductive clarinet, its
  ominously plinking glockenspiel – envelops as Tom plunges ever further into
  his pool of lies, dragging hapless heirs and dilettantes down into the murk
  with him. It’s seriously high-grade suspense, though the film thrums with a
  sadder, more profound undertone. Just beneath the film’s lacquered finish is a
  bitter, and disarmingly empathetic, consideration of what it is to live with
  unspoken desire, to yearn and reach for a golden world from which your true
  self would likely be shunned. It’s no mystery why I, having just come out of
  the closet in the summer of 1999, saw in this film something particularly
  salient. But it wasn’t just that. It was the electric rush of Minghella’s
  seamless execution, working with a cast of soon-to-be-enormous actors – who,
  I’d argue, have never been better. Few other young, straight male actors
  trying to make their name in 1990s Hollywood would have been confident enough
  to play this shifty queer protagonist with anything matching Matt Damon’s
  precise, fearless conviction. Jude Law, a sun-god beamed into the picture from
  Mount Olympus, is a perfectly loathsome and alluring Dickie Greenleaf. Philip
  Seymour Hoffman is a noxious hoot as boorish flaneur Freddie Miles. Gwyneth
  Paltrow is effectively patrician and pathetic as Dickie’s fiancee Marge, whose
  worldly chicness and easy warmth are no match for Tom’s cruel manipulations.
  And, of course, there is the magnificent Cate Blanchett, gliding off with each
  of her scenes as Meredith Logue, a socially stunted textiles princess who
  witlessly aids Tom in his deceptions, happy to be involved in a bit of
  intrigue while being rather careless with her own heart. It was all so
  exciting to witness at 16, when I was beginning to form an idea of what I
  liked about actors, about movies. And, maybe, when Hollywood was developing a
  new idea of itself. The Talented Mr Ripley might ultimately have fallen on the
  wrong side of that cultural faultline; it is the kind of Hollywood film that
  is now in woefully short supply, entertaining and artful and, despite all the
  period trappings and on-location shooting, modestly budgeted. Such things have
  largely gone away in the years since Ripley’s release. But at the time, the
  film felt – for me, anyway – like a bridge to the future. If the movie is a
  relic of a lost age, what a relic it is. And how significantly it has
  resounded in my head, returning to me again and again as I’ve ventured into
  adulthood. On any of my many rewatches, I’m certainly not seeking solace from
  Tom Ripley; I’m not even craving a trip to Italy. (Any more than usual,
  anyway.) What I am instead chasing, and remembering, is the giddiness of
  realizing that movies like Ripley could even exist, and that I was finally
  ready to see and enjoy them. Which is why The Talented Mr Ripley has become,
  in its shivery and melancholic way, a feelgood movie for me, and no doubt
  plenty of others. It’s a representation of Hollywood’s purest capability, to
  enthral and stir and transport. However naively, I still hold the hope that an
  upstart director of this era might turn to Minghella’s film, now a
  quarter-century old, and find some inspiration in it. There in its thoughtful
  construction, its deft employment of movie-star glow, its calm insistence that
  literary things can also be visceral, sensual wonders. If we can’t all go to
  Europe to find ourselves, we can at least watch Ripley and let ourselves
  darkly dream. The Talented Mr Ripley is available in the US on Paramount+ and
  the Criterion Channel, on Amazon Prime and Paramount+ in the UK and on Stan in
  Australia
