  A month or so ago, my partner and I went on a painfully short trip to northern
  Tasmania. Tucked away in a tiny cabin in the middle of nowhere, we lit fires,
  watched sunlight dip over the mountains; and, as avid birdwatchers, saw an
  abundance of avian life, nestled in the trees, awash with golden light. So at
  first, returning to our home in Sydney, where we live in a flat on a major
  street, triangulated between three different vape shops, my overwhelming
  feeling was one of despair. Gone were the rolling hills, replaced by
  convenience stores selling AI-generated posters of monkeys smoking cigars.
  Suddenly, everything I observed about city life became evidence for a growing
  theory that the human race had gone terribly, unavoidably wrong. Around this
  time, I stepped out on to the street and noticed a pigeon, nestled in the roof
  above my door. The green of the plumage around her neck glinted, a mossy river
  struck by a plume of light. She cooed, gently, and her partner fluttered up
  beside her, his beak filled with twigs, come to help build their nest,
  together. If there is anything that defines modern life, it is how
  determinedly and constantly we are trained to not really see. We wake up and
  get to work ignoring things, like we’re being paid to do so. Human brains are
  naturally predisposed to ignoring the familiar, and focusing on the new, the
  different, the outrageous. Anything we’re surrounded by for too long grows
  invisible. The humble pigeon is that ethos poured into a feathery, fragile
  little body. Pigeons are noticed only when they seem particularly foul, paid
  mind only when they annoy us. They are also victim of rampant animal welfare
  crimes: pelted with rocks, chased from dwellings, killed and maimed en mass.
  Which is ironic, because, as it goes with so many problems we face, pigeons
  are a “problem” that we have caused. Feral pigeons are descendants of homing
  pigeons that we kept and domesticated. We loved them, once. We might not
  remember that, but pigeons do. They are naturally predisposed to want to be
  close to us. They gather where we gather. They thrive as a result of the
  particular way we have decided to live, rooting through our trash, taking
  shelter in our nests. And if pigeons are dirty or disgusting, they are that
  way because we are dirty and disgusting. Forgive me for excessive
  anthropomorphism, but we live in a natural world that, rightfully, flinches
  from human touch. Pigeons are one of the few creatures that don’t. And for
  that, we punish them. But if this makes it sound as though my burgeoning
  fascination with pigeons is guided by self-hatred, more despair, excessive
  fury at the way humans have decided to live, then I have miscommunicated.
  After noticing the nesting pigeons above my door, I began to actively look for
  them, everywhere. A few days later, walking home from work, I saw a flock of
  them huddled together, eating a discarded loaf of bread. Their overlapping
  cooing sounded like the movement of water. It was no northern Tasmania, but it
  was something. A pigeon deep-dive on Wikipedia that day brought me to an
  article, published in 1995, which informed me that pigeons are able to
  differentiate between paintings by Monet and Picasso. And I was moved not only
  by the image of a little bird, wandering between impressionist and cubist
  masterpieces, but the gentle, beautiful curiosity of humans too: that we can
  be interested enough in pigeons to want to know what they think about the art
  that we make. Another thing about human brains: we adore a binary. Human
  versus non-human. Nature versus the city. Regular versus exceptional. Just
  because we see something every day – just because it surrounds us – it doesn’t
  mean it’s any less remarkable for that. So often, we picture metropolises as
  places devoid of wildlife; even in our despair, we end up drawing arbitrary
  lines between us and the natural world. Humans are not alone. Somehow, even
  after all that we have done, we still have pigeons by our side, building their
  nests, quietly, heads down, as we build ours. • Joseph Earp is a critic,
  painter and novelist. His latest book is Painting Portraits of Everyone I’ve
  Ever Dated
