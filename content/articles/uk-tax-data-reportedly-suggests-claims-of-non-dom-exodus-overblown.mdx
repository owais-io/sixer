  Claims of an exodus of wealthy “non-doms” in response to tax rises may be
  overblown, according to a report that suggests the number leaving the country
  is in line with official forecasts. In April the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,
  scrapped the non-domiciled tax status, which allowed wealthy individuals with
  connections abroad to avoid paying full UK tax on their overseas earnings.
  Since then a wave of reports has suggested that changes to the status and
  other tax policies are triggering an exodus of high net worth individuals.
  However, early monthly payroll data from HM Revenue and Customs appears to
  indicate that the number of non-dom departures is in line with official
  predictions, according to sources cited by the Financial Times The Office for
  Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast in January that 25% of non-doms with
  trusts would leave the UK in response to the abolition of the tax status,
  while 10% of those without trusts would leave. Official data suggests this
  prediction was broadly correct, people briefed on the findings told the FT.
  Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor’s Conservative predecessor, first announced moves
  to phase out the 225-year-old non-dom status that protected overseas earnings
  from being taxed in exchange for a flat annual fee. However, Labour took the
  proposals a step further by replacing them with a regime that will include
  overseas assets in the UK’s 40% inheritance tax rate. Many non-doms earn
  income from work or their pensions in the UK, which means they appear in the
  PAYE (pay as you earn) figures in the payroll data that businesses send to the
  tax office each month. If they fall off PAYE figures, that suggests they have
  left the country. The FT reported that some of those briefed on early HMRC
  data said payroll figures suggested that fewer people were leaving than
  projected by the OBR, while others said the departures were in line with
  forecasts. The numbers do not capture the movements of those non-doms who do
  not work in the UK, which could include some of the richest, but with a
  shortage of reliable data they will provide some relief to Reeves amid a
  debate about whether the policy could backfire. Payroll data is now a more
  helpful indicator of potential non-dom movement as more than 120 days have
  passed since the start of the tax year, which started on 6 April. It is likely
  that anyone who did not want to be considered as a UK tax resident would have
  left the country. HMRC has said previously that it will not have official data
  on how many non-doms who earn UK income have left until January 2027, when
  people submit self-assessment tax returns for the year 2025-26. A government
  spokesperson said: “If you make your home in Britain, then you should pay your
  taxes here too. That is why we abolished the non-dom tax status to invest in
  our public services, including the NHS. “But the UK remains a highly
  attractive place to live and invest. Our main capital gains tax rate is lower
  than any other G7 European country and our new residence-based regime is
  simpler and more attractive than the previous one, whilst it also addresses
  tax system unfairness so every long-term resident pays their taxes here.”
