  England stormed to a 16th consecutive win over France in their final warm-up
  match before the World Cup kicks off in two weeks. After a close-run Six
  Nations finale in April England’s 40-6 win in Mont-de-Marsan was a reminder of
  the physical gulf between the cross-Channel rivals, with the visitors’ pack
  instrumental in all six of their tries. It was fitting that the game, a
  friendly only in name, was scheduled amid the street festival season in
  south-west France – matches against Les Bleues are rarely dull affairs, even
  if the Red Roses have dominated Le Crunch for the last seven years. Both teams
  fielded relatively full-strength sides at the Stade André-et-Guy-Boniface,
  home to the men’s Pro D2 side Stade Montois, under heatwave temperatures. For
  John Mitchell’s team, Marlie Packer’s suspension and the head injury absence
  of Emily Scarratt were compensated for by the returns of Ellie Kildunne and
  the captain, Zoe Aldcroft. The hosts had been keen to avoid the kind of
  lethargic start that has often cost them dear against elite teams. England,
  though, picked up where they left off in the 97-7 win against Spain, with a
  physically dominant start, spending most of the first 40 minutes in France’s
  half. The visitors were ahead within four minutes, Morwenna Talling scoring
  from a driving maul on the left after a lineout five metres out. The Red
  Roses’ second try 10 minutes later came from the same routine, this time from
  the right and scored by Amy Cokayne. While Les Bleues did admirably to
  withstand the barrage of England attacks over the next 15 minutes, they were
  dealt another blow when their captain, Manaé Feleu, was shown a yellow card on
  the half-hour. France managed their first foray into England’s 22 a few
  minutes later, yielding a penalty converted by Morgane Bourgeois. The Six
  Nations champions eventually made the most of their numerical advantage,
  though, with another driving maul pushing Maud Muir over the line. As has
  often been the case in recent Le Crunch clashes, France emerged for the second
  half with a newfound urgency. Bourgeois added another three points within
  minutes of the restart, after an impressive drive through the heart of the
  England defence by Teani Feleu. England soon added a fourth try to dash any
  hopes of a comeback, though, with Megan Jones running in after a quick penalty
  from a five-metre scrum. The final half-hour was nevertheless a more balanced
  affair, with France stretching the opposition defence several times but
  undermining their efforts with repeated handling errors and poor discipline.
  Momentum swung back in England’s direction in the final 10 minutes. After
  being held up by excellent France defence a couple of times, Lark Atkin-Davies
  eventually went over for the visitors’ fifth try five minutes from time. The
  Bristol front-rower soon scored her second in similar fashion, completing an
  evening of forward supremacy. A late break from Joanna Grisez appeared to
  promise a consolation try, taking Les Bleues to within five metres of the
  line. The resulting penalty was taken quickly but a long kick straight into
  touch dashed any hopes of a score to get the 7,500-strong crowd back on their
  feet. While both sets of coaches had insisted before the match that the final
  result would not be their primary concern, a 16th consecutive win for England
  over France (and their biggest in 15 years) will provide vindication of the
  work done over their summer-long training camp. “It’s a privilege to have this
  pressure,” Mitchell said, when asked about the expectations for England before
  their home World Cup. “We’ve earned it over this three-year cycle, it’s not
  something we’re going to walk away from. We’ve worked hard to be in this
  position.” For the hosts, their lone warm-up match offered something of a
  reality check. “We’re disappointed, because clearly we didn’t show what we’ve
  worked on this summer,” France’s coach, Gaëlle Mignot, lamented. “But we’re a
  resilient team, we’ll get back to work. “We wanted to play against England to
  get an idea of how we were doing, and that’s definitely what happened tonight.
  We know that if we don’t improve in every sector, we’ll have a hard time
  during the tournament.” The two sides are expected to meet again in five
  weeks’ time, this time in Bristol for a blockbuster World Cup semi-final.
  Before then, England face the USA in Sunderland on 22 August in the
  tournament’s curtain-raiser, while Les Bleues take on Italy in Exeter the
  following day.
