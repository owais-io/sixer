  I was delightfully unsurprised to read your report (Chemical companies
  lobbying MPs not to ban Pfas, 29 August). Pfas really are a bigger problem
  than most people realise. I must confess to some involvement here: in the
  1970s, when working for a big US corporation, I used Pfa-based chemicals in a
  widely used recipe for food-can sealants. On reflection, I needn’t have done,
  but the chemical company rep was very generous with samples and lunch, and
  there was never any suggestion that they might be harmful. Now, after decades
  of practising the greenest chemistry I can, I know for sure that Pfas are
  entirely unnecessary; I have yet to find them particularly better or more
  economic in any of the many recipes for everyday useful stuff that I have
  worked on. Let’s align with the EU and ban them, for the sake of future
  generations. Alan Smith Chief scientist, Paragon Resources UK
