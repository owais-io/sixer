  ‘Can literature be a tool to encourage something better – creating eco-topia
  on the page, so it might be imagined off it?” asks the novelist Sarah Hall in
  this weekend’s Guardian magazine. Climate fiction – or “cli-fi” – continues to
  grow as a genre in its own right; the first Climate fiction prize was awarded
  this year. And while the roots of environmental fiction are in apocalypse and
  despair, these five writers are moving beyond dystopia to hopeful
  possibilities. *** The Overstory by Richard Powers Powers was awarded the 2019
  Pulitzer for this love letter to the arboreal world. Mimicking the interlinked
  canopy and undergrowth of the forest, he weaves the stories of nine core
  characters whose lives are deeply connected to trees. Olivia and Nick, for
  example, set up camp in a giant redwood for a year to prevent it from being
  cut down. They connect with other characters over their environmental
  activism, with one tragic consequence. But ultimately the novel is a homage to
  the resilience of humans and trees. *** Gun Island by Amitav Ghosh In Ghosh’s
  globetrotting novel inspired by Bengali legends, environmental destruction
  surfaces again and again: climate change-induced migration, wildfires, beached
  dolphins. This is no dystopia, but climate realism. Yet the novel feels
  fundamentally hopeful, with Ghosh nodding to cross-cultural cooperation as a
  means of facing climate destruction. Two female characters, marine biologist
  Piya and historian Cinta, also fortify us. “I don’t think my book is climate
  fiction at all,” said Ghosh in a 2019 interview. “It’s actually a reality that
  in hard circumstances humans often discover joy and faith.” *** Parable of the
  Sower by Octavia E Butler Originally published in 1993, Parable of the Sower
  is set between 2024 and 2027 in a California bordering on anarchy, marked by
  economic breakdown and climate change. The narrator, Lauren Olamina, suffers
  from hyperempathy syndrome, meaning she feels the pain of others acutely. She
  creates a new religion, Earthseed, which posits that humans have the power to
  “shape God” and enact change. Verses from Earthseed’s book of scripture are
  scattered throughout the novel: “Belief initiates and guides action – or it
  does nothing.” *** Flight Behaviour by Barbara Kingsolver Escaping an unhappy
  marriage on a failing Appalachian farm, Dellarobia is en route to meet her
  would-be lover when she is stopped in her tracks by a sea of orange monarch
  butterflies, set off their migratory course by climate change. Dellarobia’s
  discovery draws an entomologist to the area, and with his help she undergoes a
  metamorphosis of her own. *** A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers
  This slim novel, published in 2021, is set on a utopian moon, Panga, following
  a destructive “Factory Age”. Humanity has since deindustrialised,
  transitioning to agrarian, sustainable living. Our protagonist, non-binary tea
  monk Dex, travels between Panga’s villages in their wagon, offering
  personalised brews and a listening ear to troubled residents. But soon, Dex
  craves quiet, and journeys into the wilderness, where they strike up a
  friendship with a robot, Splendid Speckled Mosscap, who is looking to answer
  the question: “What do humans need?” This cosy novella slots into the
  “hopepunk” subgenre of speculative fiction for its optimistic exploration of
  life’s meaning and humanity’s relationship to nature and technology.
