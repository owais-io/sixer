  As a young researcher trying to understand the British media’s obsession with
  social security “scroungers” in the 1970s I came to appreciate the invaluable
  answers that the Guardian journalist Malcolm Dean gave to my endless
  questions. He was a crucial resource in my studies, later published in book
  form as Images of Welfare (1982). Over subsequent years we had frequent
  conversations, many of which surfaced, I’m sure, as “academics are saying …”
  inserts into his social policy leaders. His own book, Democracy Under Attack
  (2011), was an informed insider discussion of the ways social policy matters
  reached public awareness through the media. His experience, knowledge and
  insight are much missed, and his generous contribution to my own understanding
  will always be deeply valued.
