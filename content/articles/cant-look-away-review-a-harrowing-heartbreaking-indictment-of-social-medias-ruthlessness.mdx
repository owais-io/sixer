  media’s ruthlessness

  “Tweens are herd animals” and have “an addicts’ narrative”, according to
  internal documents revealed by a Facebook whistleblower to congress, making
  clear the levels of cynicism and obfuscation the company operates with in its
  quest to hook young people to its platform. Bad though that is, it’s not the
  worst example in this lucidly laid out and often harrowing indictment of
  social media’s ruthlessness; that would be the proliferation of drug dealers
  on Snapchat, which the company seems to have to some extent turned a blind eye
  to in the scramble to expand its user base. Based on the investigative work of
  Bloomberg journalist Olivia Carville, this film covers the attempts of minnow
  legal outfit Social Media Victims Law Center to net the sharks of Silicon
  Valley. It represents a host of families who have suffered heartbreaking
  losses due to unpoliced extreme online content: children and teenagers who
  fatally copied auto-asphyxiation or pro-suicide videos, ones who killed
  themselves after falling victim to sextortionists, or who overdosed after
  buying off-prescription meds from predatory dealers. The battle here is to
  overcome section 230, a get-out clause in the 1996 Telecommunication Act that
  gives social media companies immunity for third-party-generated content. Of
  course, Mark Zuckerberg was still slurping Slush Puppies back then. Matthew
  Bergman, the center’s founder, twice makes the analogy with cigarette
  companies, arguing that social media companies knowingly prioritise profit
  over the health of their users. If the film is clear about this causation and
  the resulting damage, it is not a given that the team can make a longer leap:
  from establishing a degree of culpability in individual cases and getting
  justice and closure for these families, to proving that the tech companies
  systematically predicate their algorithms on fanning our most negative
  tendencies and impulses. The big victory here is stopping the Snapchat case
  being dismissed due to section 230; more of a minor triumph that shows the
  scale of the mountain, but you have to start somewhere. This is a vital piece
  of public-interest journalism clearly spelling out what we all vaguely
  intuited. • Can’t Look Away is in UK cinemas and on Jolt from 8 August • In
  the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or
