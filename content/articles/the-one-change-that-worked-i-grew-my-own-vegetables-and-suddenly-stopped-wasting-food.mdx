  The one change that worked: I grew my own vegetables – and suddenly stopped
  wasting food

  From calendar-keeping to cooking, for years, my hyper-organised personality
  crept into every corner of my life. I would save Instagram recipe videos and
  cuttings from weekend newspapers and use them to plan shopping lists with
  grand ideas about midweek dinners: a white bean stew pencilled in for one
  night, tacos another, homemade burgers another. I was always overambitious.
  You would think this level of planning would translate into less food waste.
  But a busy routine working in London, often with last-minute events and long
  commutes, meant I was too tired to make anything when I came home. By
  Wednesday, I would fill up with shop-bought sushi or soup. More often than
  not, I would get to the end of the week with a fridge full of wilted
  ingredients, which I would quietly chuck into the food waste. I felt guilt and
  shame, but I was stuck in a loop. It took an audit of my spending last summer
  to get myself in check. During that time, I also decided to grow tomatoes in
  the garden of my shared flat. I was a novice gardener, but soon I became
  obsessed with caring for these plants. It was as if a switch had been flicked
  in my mind – as if it had taken the idea of growing my own food to truly
  understand the value and timescale of food production. I made a commitment to
  myself then and there to change my habits. Now, I save every last scrap of
  uneaten food and integrate it into my next meal: using cubes of stale bread to
  bulk up soups, or cracking an egg or two into a three-day-old chilli for a
  breakfast shakshuka. I have a container of vegetable skins in the freezer,
  which I’m planning to boil for stock. Quick-pickled carrots or cucumbers, with
  a splash of soy, are a go-to for brightening boring carbs. When I can, I’ll
  pick up Too Good to Go boxes, which contain surplus food from local cafes,
  restaurants and bakeries for reduced prices, and challenge myself to make
  something quick and tasty from the random assortment. It’s usually a soup, or
  “stovies” – a Scottish dish made with boiled potatoes and whatever meat is
  available. I also broke the closed-minded rules I had cemented in my head
  about food. Fruit can go with savoury dishes, for instance – apples work well
  in curries, while berries add colour to a salad. I used to shy away from beige
  on beige, but leftover roast potatoes with garlic and spaghetti is a new
  favourite. A lot of this is probably obvious to most people – but for me, it
  has been something of a breakthrough, although not without a few flavour
  disasters. I’ve learned that Sichuan pepper and mint should be used sparingly,
  and that it is possible to add too much chocolate to a chilli. My way to make
  anything edible is to cover it in sriracha. I’m less ambitious with midweek
  meals now, but I’m much more creative. I have saved money and time, and will
  no longer wince when I open the fridge at the end of the week. It’s been
  freeing, in a way – and has helped me embrace spontaneity in other parts of my
  life, such as social plans. Best of all, I’ve rediscovered what I loved about
  cooking in the first place: the joy of making something delicious out of
  almost nothing.
