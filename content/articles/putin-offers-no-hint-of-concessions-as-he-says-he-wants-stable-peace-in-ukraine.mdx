  Putin offers no hint of concessions as he says he wants ‘stable’ peace in
  Ukraine

  Vladimir Putin has said he wants a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but
  given no indication that he is willing to make any concessions to achieve it,
  after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and
  destruction across Ukraine. “We need a lasting and stable peace on solid
  foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the
  security of both countries,” said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a
  week before a new deadline imposed by Donald Trump for hostilities to cease.
  Trump has said if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement to end the
  war by next Friday, 8 August, he will impose a package of economic sanctions
  on Russia. Before he took office, Trump had promised to end the war in 24
  hours, but since he became president his repeated overtures to Putin have
  achieved minimal results. In recent weeks, Trump has markedly changed his
  rhetoric on the conflict, appearing less conciliatory to Putin and more
  amenable to enhanced support for Ukraine. He called Russia’s continued attacks
  on civilian areas “disgusting” on Thursday. Last month Trump said he was
  “disappointed” with Putin. “We’ll have a great conversation. I’ll say: ‘That’s
  good, I’ll think we’re close to getting it done,’ and then he’ll knock down a
  building in Kyiv,” he told the BBC. Seemingly referencing Trump’s comments,
  Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all
  disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general
  rule.” The death toll from a series of Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early
  hours of Thursday rose sharply on Friday, to 31, after rescuers found more
  than a dozen bodies in the rubble of an apartment block that had collapsed
  after one of the strikes. There were five children among the dead, including a
  two-year-old, while 159 people were wounded in the attack, one of the worst to
  hit the Ukrainian capital in more than three years of full-scale war. Putin
  has periodically claimed to be interested in peace, but only on terms wholly
  unacceptable to Kyiv. Last week, the third round of direct talks between
  Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but broke up in less than an hour
  and have so far led to no agreements except on prisoner exchanges. Speaking to
  reporters at a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko,
  in northern Russia, Putin said he hoped the peace talks would continue, and
  that they should be conducted “without cameras and in a calm atmosphere”.
  Ukraine, however, says Russia has shown it is not serious about the talks by
  sending a low-level delegation led by Vladimir Medinsky, a former culture
  minister known for writing patriotic books about history. “This level of
  delegation does not have the authority to negotiate, just to spew insults and
  announce demands,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Zelenskyy aide, in an interview
  in Kyiv. Zelenskyy has said he wants to meet Putin one-on-one, with either
  Trump or the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as moderator. On Friday,
  he responded to Putin’s claim of being interested in peace with another
  suggestion to meet. “If this is a signal of serious readiness to end the war
  with dignity and establish a truly lasting peace, and not just an attempt to
  buy more time for the war and delay sanctions, then Ukraine once again
  confirms its readiness to meet at the leaders’ level at any time,” Zelenskyy
  wrote on his Telegram channel.
