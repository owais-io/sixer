  Rachel Reeves has told investors she would like to see a “market-based
  solution” for problems at Thames Water, rather than placing the company into
  special administration. The chancellor sent a letter in July to the Thames
  Water creditor group, which represents about 100 financial institutions that
  are trying to create a rescue plan for the company. Reeves sent the letter
  after comments from the environment secretary, Steve Reed, in June. He told
  MPs the government had “stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all
  eventualities … including [a] special administration regime if that were to
  become necessary”. The remarks are reported to have caused concern among some
  debt-holders in the water industry, as such steps would involve a temporary
  form of nationalisation, leading to the restructuring of its £17.7bn net debt
  and the possible sale of the company to new owners. In the letter, seen by the
  Times, Reeves wrote: “The government recognises the seriousness of the
  situation facing Thames Water … Our position remains that the company should
  find a sustainable, market-based solution to the current situation. “This
  solution must not only secure the company’s long-term financial stability but
  also deliver a successful turnaround that achieves positive outcomes for
  customers and the environment.” However, she echoed Reed’s earlier remarks,
  writing: “The government is prepared for all eventualities across its
  regulated industries and has undertaken detailed contingency planning for a
  special administration regime, should this be required to ensure the continued
  provision of vital public services.” Thames Water has been under the effective
  control of its senior creditors, which hold most of its debt pile since
  shareholders walked away from the company last year. The water company, which
  serves 16 million customers across London and the south-east, has been on the
  verge of financial collapse for several years, after decades of
  underinvestment and dividend extraction. Thames has desperately been seeking a
  way out of the turmoil without the government being forced to take control
  under a special administration regime, which is essentially temporary
  nationalisation. Last month it emerged the government had engaged the advisory
  firm FTI Consulting to look at its options, including special administration.
  The government is planning to abolish Ofwat, which could result in further
  complications as rival water companies might also consider legal action if
  Thames secures a favourable deal not available to them. A government
  spokesperson said: “The government will always act in the national interest on
  these issues. “The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up
  our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, including applying for
  a special administration regime if that were to become necessary.”
