  The former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik is set to join Keir
  Starmer’s team as chief economic adviser. In a boost to the prime minister’s
  office in the run-up to the autumn budget, Lady Shafik is expected to take on
  the role after a year heading a Foreign Office review of the government’s
  foreign aid spending. A member of the House of Lords, Shafik resigned last
  year as the president of Columbia University after criticism of the treatment
  of Jewish students during anti-Israel protests at the institution’s New York
  campus. Shafik was previously head of the London School of Economics, a deputy
  governor of the International Monetary Fund and the top civil servant at the
  now defunct Department for International Development. In 2019 she was touted
  as a possible contender to replace Mark Carney as the Bank of England’s
  governor. No 10 has sought to give more weight to its economic unit after a
  series of missteps that some Downing Street advisers have blamed on naivety
  inside the Treasury. Most recently, Rachel Reeves was forced to back down in
  the face of a backbench rebellion after she proposed cutting disability
  benefits. That retreat left the chancellor facing an even tougher challenge in
  her autumn budget, in which she is expected to have to set out plans to close
  a deficit of between £20bn and £40bn. Starmer is known to want high-level
  economic advice of his own, separate to the support given to the chancellor.
  Sajid Javid, a former chancellor, quit his post after the then prime minister,
  Boris Johnson, made clear that all Treasury decisions would need to be agreed
  by No 10. It is understood that Reeves is unlikely to quit after the
  appointment of Shafik, but rumours have swirled around Westminster that the
  chancellor’s tenure could be cut short if she fails to steer through a
  politically and economically successful budget. Reeves is also seeking to
  attract heavyweight advisers to the Treasury after the LSE’s John Van Reenen
  scaled back his support to return to academia and Anna Volero departed. There
  is likely to be criticism of Shafik’s appointment from some inside No 10 who
  wanted an expert in the UK economy to guide Starmer’s policymaking. Shafik,
  who was raised in Egypt before moving to the US as a child, has spent most her
  working life in organisations focused on resolving global poverty. Her
  supporters would argue that two and half years on the Bank of England’s
  interest-rate setting committee and six years at the LSE gave her a deep
  understanding of the UK economy. Starmer’s office was contacted for comment.
