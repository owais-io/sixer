  Bugonia review – Emma Stone might be an alien in Yorgos Lanthimos’s macabre
  conspiracy theory comedy

  Yorgos Lanthimos’s macabre and amusing new film has a predictably strong
  performance from Emma Stone, an intestine-shreddingly clamorous orchestral
  score from Jerskin Fendrix and, most importantly, a wonderful montage finale –
  but frankly it’s a very, very long run-up to that big jump. Added to which,
  there is the question of whether this bizarre if sometimes heavy-handed black
  comedy has fully earned its eventual pivot to serious tragic issues in the
  ending. Does the globally traumatised finale succeed in retrospectively
  upgrading the significance of what has preceded it? Do these avowedly
  important images and moods quite match up with the
  single-joke-single-punchline movie with all its violent slapstick grotesquerie
  that went before? Working with screenwriter Will Tracy, Lanthimos has remade
  the 2003 Korean film Save the Green Planet!, changing the gender of the
  corporate character. Audiences might also be reminded of the great Danish
  provocateur Lars von Trier by the tongue-in-cheek portentous chapter headings,
  or even M Night Shyamalan’s widely derided mystery drama The Happening from
  2008, which features the disappearance of honeybees. The title refers to a
  myth about bees emerging from a dead ox; our seething antihero Teddy, played
  by Jesse Plemons, is a beekeeper, devastated by the progressive diminution of
  the honeybee population and blaming this on eco-devastation caused by a vast
  retail/pharmaceutical conglomerate run by dead-eyed corporate ice queen
  Michelle, played by Stone. Her company also gravely injured Teddy’s troubled
  mother, Sandy, played by Alicia Silverstone, with its experimental opioid
  withdrawal drugs. Mistrustful of mainstream media, Teddy has been doing his
  own research on the internet about capitalism and elitist conspiracies, and he
  now believes that Michelle is an evil space alien. With his trusting, innocent
  cousin (played by Aidan Delbis) he sets out to kidnap and torture Michelle in
  his basement until she and her fellow Andromedans promise to leave earthlings
  alone. Stone is lethally cold and heartless as Michelle; she gets up at 4.30am
  every day for various workouts and comes in to the office to assure her cowed
  staff that – after bad publicity about an overwork-related crisis – they can
  leave work at 5.30pm if they really think they have earned it. Her
  seven-stages-of-grief-type reaction to finding herself chained to a bed in a
  scuzzy house cycles through imperious demands and threats, wary diplomacy,
  pleading, followed by humouring Teddy by agreeing that, sure, yes, OK, she’s
  an alien. (Although for all its confrontational gross out, the film flinches
  from the lavatorial realities of her imprisonment.) Plemons himself delivers
  an efficient punch as the fanatical Teddy and there is something subtle and
  unexpected in his relationship with the local cop Casey (Stavros Halkias) who
  comes to see him, inhibited in his investigation by some painful shared
  memories of their childhood. Bugonia is a very well made film, and while it is
  not true to say it is less than the sum of its parts, it is less than that
  final and very powerful part. Like Ari Aster’s recent film Eddington, it also
  shows how difficult it is to make internet conspiracy obsession interesting.
  For me, Bugonia doesn’t have the ingenuity and elegance of Lanthimos’s
  previous film Kinds of Kindness, nor the emotional generosity and audacity of
  his steampunk fantasia Poor Things. It’s a spiny, prickly, hothouse flower. •
