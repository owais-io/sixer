  When Ar’reiona Green was accepted to Sacramento State last year, she knew she
  would need books and school supplies. She didn’t expect to need a toolbox. Or
  hangers. Or that her dorm room wouldn’t come with a fan or a lamp. Like many
  first-year students, Green, who is headed into her sophomore year and plans to
  become a plastic surgeon, was excited about her future adventures. But coming
  up through the foster system in California, she didn’t know anyone who had
  gone to college. While she felt ready for her classes, life as a college
  student was mostly mysterious except for what she’d seen online. That’s where
  Dec My Dorm stepped in. The program works with more than 140 foster youth
  headed to college, hosting an annual event in July to kit out each student
  with sheet sets, pillows, a shower caddy and connections to other people in
  the same situation. Green took part in the summer of 2024, leaving with
  several duffel bags filled with the things she needed, including many items
  she didn’t know she would need, like dish soap. “I was expecting bed stuff and
  towels,” Green said. “I wasn’t expecting them to give me period products and
  school supplies. They were giving out school merch and stepping stools and
  toolboxes. They really went above and beyond.” The program started in 2018
  when Jill Franklin, a program manager of the Independent Living Program for
  the department of children and family services in Los Angeles county, met a
  student who came from the foster system. The young woman described arriving at
  the University of California at Berkeley with just a trash bag, not knowing
  that dorm rooms are spartan affairs with a desk, chair, bed with an oddly
  sized mattress – and that’s it. “She didn’t have a pillow or a sheet or a
  towel, and everybody else was there with their parents and their bags of
  stuff,” Franklin said. “At the time, I was editing college essays and I
  realized, we never ever thought about that first day.” Franklin started with a
  small Amazon wishlist and a handful of students. It was particularly important
  that the kids were involved in the process as much as possible, she said,
  because they were used to living in spaces that were not their own. “You might
  have a 17-year-old who’s on the football team and says: ‘I don’t want Minnie
  Mouse sheets,’ but oh well, that’s what it is, and they probably aren’t going
  to be there for very long and it’s not their bedroom,” said Franklin. “It was
  very important that they pick their own bedding, their own towels and their
  own blankets, so that when they walk in that room, or someone else walks in
  that room, it says: ‘This is who I am.’” In 2022, she met Phyllis Shinbane,
  who had retired as director of operations from Connecting a Caring Community,
  a non-profit organization based in Calabasas, California. Like many people,
  Shinbane had been unaware that foster youth often have nothing they can bring
  with them to college, but realized this was a need she could help fill. Along
  with CCC’s executive director, Lisa Kodimer, and the Dec My Dorm co-chair
  Allison Weiss, they raised more than $40,000 in donations and connected with
  sponsors and volunteers to help 142 students in 2025. “It’s just leveling the
  playing field,” said Shinbane, who hopes to expand the program to other
  states. “It’s just putting them in a room where they’re equal, where they’re
  not different, where their past doesn’t define them, that they are the same as
  every other college student that came from a supportive, structured, safe
  home.” Eight per cent to 11% of people in foster care obtain a bachelor’s
  degree, said Sarah Wasch, associate director of the Field Center for
  Children’s Policy, Practice &amp; Research at the University of Pennsylvania.
  Although most people in foster care can remain in the system until they are at
  least 21 years old, many foster parents don’t have the funds to furnish a dorm
  room. “There’s a disconnect around who is responsible to oversee that
  transition,” Wasch said. “For youth in foster care, it’s very unclear if it’s
  the foster family’s responsibility, the case manager’s, the court’s or the
  legal guardian’s.” While some states have programs addressing foster care and
  higher education, efforts remain piecemeal and there are plenty of gaps to
  fill, like dorm room needs and storage over summers, she said. Most colleges
  have support systems specifically aimed at supporting students who come from
  the foster system, like the Guardian Scholars program in California. Those
  focus mainly on financial support for tuition and meals, and advising for
  classes, not for student life. At one point, legislation was introduced to
  create a federal center that would coordinate state efforts, but it did not
  pass, Wasch said. Kelisha Williams, a foster student from Kentucky who
  graduated from Harvard University last spring, said she wished there had been
  a program like Dec My Dorm when she was going to school. Although Harvard
  provided a list of dorm room essentials, she watched a lot of YouTube videos
  to figure out what she would need to fit in and worked to save the money. She
  emphasized that it’s not just about having the essentials, like a shower caddy
  and a bar of soap. Not having those things could make foster students feel
  like they don’t belong. “I knew that was going to be a big hurdle, and I did
  not want anyone to know that I was not like them, or that I didn’t deserve to
  be there,” Williams, 22, said. “So I kind of just made sure that I worked the
  summer before to have everything that I needed, even, you know, if it was kind
  of plush objects like posters and things like that.” Shinbane said that many
  volunteers were enthusiastic about going with students to set up their dorm
  rooms, if desired, but there were legal concerns about privacy. The
  organization offers other resources, like free eye-screening and glasses, and
  providing students with a resource folder with QR codes linking students to
  food assistance, clothing programs and campus support. They invite former
  participants to come meet the new class headed to college, so they can offer
  advice and support. “This program is like a living, breathing thing,” Shinbane
  said. “It evolves every year, and our goal is to provide them with services
  and resources to help ensure their success.”
