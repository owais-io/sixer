  Thailand’s constitutional court has dismissed Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her
  position as prime minister, ruling that as the country’s leader she violated
  constitutional rules on ethics in a phone call with Cambodia’s senate
  president, Hun Sen. The ruling, which ushers in a fresh period of instability
  in the country, means she immediately loses her job, which she had held for
  about a year. The 39-year-old had already been suspended from her duties on 1
  July after a recording was leaked of her phone conversation with Hun Sen, in
  which they discussed a simmering border dispute between the neighbouring
  countries. Critics accused her of failing to protect Thailand’s interests
  during the call, in which she addressed Hun Sen as “uncle”, and told him that
  if there were anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made
  critical remarks about a senior Thai military commander. Paetongtarn, the
  daughter of the billionaire former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra, apologised
  for her comments, describing them a negotiating tactic. However, the leaked
  conversation created a major political crisis for her government, only one
  year after she took office. A coalition partner quit her government in June,
  leaving her with only a slim majority, while thousands of protesters took to
  the streets of Bangkok, demanding her resignation. Friday’s case stemmed from
  a petition filed in June by a group of senators, calling for her to be removed
  from office, accusing her of lacking integrity and violating ethical
  standards. The call not only plunged Paetongtarn’s government into chaos but
  marked a significant deterioration in Thai-Cambodian relations. Weeks after
  the recording was leaked, the border dispute erupted into a five-day conflict
  in which dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.
  Anger over the phone call, and Paetongtarn’s handling of the border crisis,
  has been exacerbated by a perception that her family’s personal relationship
  with Hun Sen was undermining and interfering with Thailand’s national
  interests. A full version of the recording was published by Hun Sen, who also
  threatened to release further compromising information about Paetongtarn’s
  father, Thaksin. Hun Sen is known to have been an old friend of Thaskin’s,
  though, for unknown reasons, they are now locked in a bitter feud. Paetongtarn
  is the fourth member of her family to have their term cut short either by a
  military coup or court ruling. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006,
  while in 2008 Thaksin’s brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat, who was prime
  minister briefly, was also forced from power by a court ruling. In 2014,
  Thaksin’s sister Yingluck was ousted by a court decision followed by a
  military coup. The embattled family has been locked in a power struggle with
  Thailand’s military royalist establishment for decades, though its survival is
  also threatened by a decline in support among voters.
