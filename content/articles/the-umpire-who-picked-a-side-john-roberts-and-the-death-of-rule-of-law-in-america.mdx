  On 4 March, Donald Trump delivered his epic 100-minute speech to Congress, the
  longest such presidential address in US history. Having finished speaking, in
  time-honored fashion, he walked down the line of supreme court justices,
  gladhanding each in turn before coming to a stop before the chief justice,
  John Roberts. “Thank you again, thank you again,” Trump said, taking Roberts’s
  hand into both his own and shaking it vigorously. Then, as he began to step
  away, the president tapped Roberts on the arm in a gesture of buddy-buddy
  intimacy, and said: “Won’t forget.” Supreme court watchers have wondered why
  Trump thanked the chief justice so effusively. Was it because the Roberts
  court had, exactly a year earlier, allowed Trump to stay on the electoral
  ballot even though he had inspired a violent mob attack on the US Capitol on 6
  January 2021? Could it have been that Roberts had written the ruling that
  immunised Trump from criminal prosecution for that January 6 insurrection and
  for any other criminal misdeed he might commit while in the White House? Or
  was it, as Trump later claimed, more innocent than that: a simple thank you to
  Roberts for having administered the oath of office at Trump’s second
  inauguration? Whatever the truth, time has moved on since that friendly
  encounter five months ago. Were the president to bump into the chief justice
  today, one might expect an even more extravagant display of gratitude. In the
  past 10 weeks America has witnessed an extraordinary outpouring of decisions
  from its highest court that should make Trump very happy indeed. The six
  rightwing justices who control the court – three of them given their lifetime
  seats by Trump himself – have effectively greenlighted the president’s
  explosive and law-busting agenda. The supermajority has granted Trump 18
  straight victories in the administration’s requests for emergency relief.
  Steve Vladeck, a leading supreme court scholar at Georgetown University Law
  Center, has tracked the decisions in his Substack, One First, noting that the
  rulings have been handed down largely in the legal darkness. They have been
  piped through the court’s so-called “shadow docket”, where important affairs
  of state are decided at speed and with little or no debate or deliberation. By
  Vladeck’s count, seven of the orders have been issued without any explanation,
  leaving the American people clueless as to the justices’ thinking. Yet the
  emergency rulings, though temporary in nature, could have seismic
  consequences. For as long as they hold they have the potential to cause untold
  suffering to millions of people targeted by Trump. That includes countless
  federal employees who can now be fired at whim after decades of loyal public
  service; transgender people purged from the military; more than 1 million
  individuals from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and other countries who are being
  stripped of their status to remain in the US; immigrants singled out for
  deportation to war-torn third countries where their lives are in danger.
  Legally, the consequences are also profound. Several of Trump’s actions given
  temporary go-ahead are of dubious legality, violating congressional or
  international laws and running roughshod over fundamental tenets of the US
  constitution. By conceding to Trump’s wishes, the justices have for now
  approved what Vladeck has called “a truly unprecedented amount of lawlessness
  by the executive branch”. The liberal-leaning justice Sonia Sotomayor has
  sounded a similar alarm in a series of increasingly despairing dissenting
  opinions. Her conservative peers on the court, she has written, are “rewarding
  lawlessness”, and undermining the bedrock principle that America is a
  “government of laws, not of men”. All of this has put Roberts, 70, in a
  strange and uncomfortable position. Just as he should be celebrating the
  completion of his 20th year at the pinnacle of the US judiciary, he is being
  accused of betraying the very legal edifice he is supposed to protect.
  Prominent jurists have held Roberts responsible for emboldening Trump’s drive
  towards an authoritarian presidency. J Michael Luttig, who served on a federal
  appeals court for 15 years, put the criticism starkly. “The chief justice is
  presiding over the end of the rule of law in America,” Luttig told the
  Guardian. In Luttig’s view, the court under Roberts is “acquiescing in and
  accommodating the president’s lawlessness. And it is doing so without
  briefing, without argument, without deliberation – and without even a single
  word of explanation of its decisions.” For Luttig, this is more than just the
  6-3 supermajority of the court expressing its conservatism. This is a
  fundamental distortion of the American legal system. “The supreme court was
  never intended to function like this. Never before has it entertained such
  challenges from the president, and never before has it decided them so
  flippantly.” *** When it comes to assessing the chief justice’s record, Luttig
  has special standing. He was himself a one-time contender for a supreme court
  seat, and has known Roberts as a friend since they worked together in their
  20s in the Reagan administration. Roberts asked Luttig to be a groomsman at
  his wedding in 1996. “I have had four decades of knowing and respecting him,”
  Luttig said. Having had a ringside seat for so many years, Luttig has no
  doubts about how the chief justice is conducting himself in the current
  fraught moment. “John Roberts knows exactly what he is doing,” the judge said,
  “and he knows exactly the message he is sending to America.” Luttig’s
  characterisation of Roberts as a disciplined individual with absolute
  self-awareness chimes with the chief justice’s reputation as someone who cares
  deeply about public image. His attention to detail is legendary: he is known
  to rehearse his questions and fine-tune his jokes before oral arguments. He
  speaks so smoothly – and disguises his inner convictions so thoroughly – that
  he has been able to straddle political and personal divides. As one lawyer who
  has presented before Roberts at the supreme court put it: “There is no person
  I would rather deliver my eulogy, even if I knew that he hated me.” The roots
  of Roberts’s controlled conservatism lie in Buffalo, New York, where he was
  born on 27 January 1955, and in north-west Indiana where his family moved when
  he was 10. He was brought up in a devout Catholic well-to-do family enjoying
  the benefits of the post-war boom. His parents came from Johnstown, now a
  struggling hollowed-out town in western Pennsylvania but then one of the
  world’s great steel-producing centers. His father, John Glover “Jack” Roberts
  Sr rose to be a manager of a steel plant and moved the family to Long Beach,
  Indiana, a heavily segregated white enclave on Lake Michigan. As a teenager,
  Roberts imbibed a fusion of Catholic morality and a powerful work ethic. He
  went on to attend an elite Catholic boarding school, La Lumiere, that had been
  recently founded by local businessmen. “I have always wanted to stay ahead of
  the crowd,” he wrote in an application letter to the school at age 13. “I’m
  sure that by attending and doing my best at La Lumiere I will assure myself of
  a fine future.” Harvard and its law school followed. He remarked in 2006 that
  the culture shock of being an Indiana boy surrounded by liberal students
  protesting against the Vietnam war helped cement his conservatism. “I didn’t
  view myself as conservative until I went there and kind of reacted against the
  orthodoxy,” he said. Joan Biskupic, who wrote a 2019 biography of Roberts,
  describes him as having emerged from Harvard with a “flawless veneer” and an
  eye for appearances. In The Chief, she writes: “He has always shown a keen
  interest in how he is portrayed in the media. Even as a young lawyer in the
  Reagan administration, he demonstrated an awareness of the importance of
  messaging.” The message for which Roberts is most famous was deployed during
  his Senate confirmation hearings for the role of chief justice in 2005. In a
  speech dripping with faux humility, he presented himself as the impartial
  arbiter of the law. “Judges are like umpires,” he said. “Umpires don’t make
  the rules, they apply them … Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the
  umpire.” Over the past 20 years he has honed that umpire character, modelling
  himself as a modern institutionalist. He has kept his personal convictions
  largely hidden, shrouding himself and his leanings in mystery; as Biskupic
  puts it, he is “his own enigma”. Meanwhile, the court he leads has marched –
  through Trump’s three nominations of Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy
  Coney Barrett – in an ever more rightward direction. Over time, the gulf has
  steadily widened between Roberts’s media representation as a moderate
  conservative and the increasingly extreme actions of his court. “Supreme court
  reporting has been generous to Roberts, and has reinforced the idea that what
  is happening in his court is a sort of normalcy, when it is not normal at
  all,” said Lisa Graves, the former chief counsel for nominations for the
  Senate judiciary committee and founder of True North Research, a watchdog
  investigating rightwing groups that undermine democracy. Graves has
  reappraised the chief justice’s 20-year record and come up with a very
  different narrative than that of Umpire Roberts. Her conclusions are laid out
  in her forthcoming book, Without Precedent, which will be published next
  month. In it, she argues that Roberts is anything but the modest judge he
  claims to be. Rather, he has used his power as chief justice to promote a
  rightwing agenda from the moment George W Bush placed him in the court’s
  central seat in 2005. “He has consistently shown hostility towards civil
  rights, trade unions and environmental protections, approaching the law with
  the rigidity of a rightwing ideologue. That was true from the time when as a
  young man he chose to clerk for the most regressive supreme court justice,
  William Rehnquist, and it remains true today,” Graves said. Roberts cut his
  legal teeth not in the wood-panelled setting of a federal court, but in the
  executive branch as an eager young pup in the Reagan administration. He began
  in 1981 working for Ken Starr, then chief of staff to the US attorney general
  (and later Bill Clinton’s bete noire), before joining the White House
  counsel’s office where he became friends with Luttig. Those early days of
  Ronald Reagan’s first term bear comparison with Trump’s second. Both
  presidents wielded a strong media presence, both were vitriolically dismissive
  of liberals whom they blamed for destroying America, both were committed to
  radical tax and spending cuts and slashing what they regarded as the bloated
  federal government. Roberts adopted Reagan’s mission with zeal. “I felt he was
  speaking directly to me,” he once recalled about listening to the newly
  ensconced president’s 1981 inaugural speech. Within the Reagan administration,
  Roberts began to formulate rightwing passions that have endured through his
  years on the top court. They included hostility towards civil rights and
  voting protections for racial minorities, and skepticism of racially based
  affirmative action. At the justice department he wrote a series of spiky legal
  memos in which he let down his mild-mannered guard. Out came a stream of
  aggressive and combative missives designed to boost Reagan’s power and
  stature. The memos make for a chilling read in the context of today. Roberts
  lambasts fellow government officials whom he accused of standing in the way of
  the Reagan agenda – an echo of Trump and Doge’s war on the “deep state” civil
  service. He railed against affirmative action programs seeking to redress the
  balance for women and Black people – a view that was made manifest in 2023
  when his court put an end to affirmative action in universities. The future
  head of the US judiciary went so far in his memos as to berate federal judges
  for what he called “unwarranted interference” in executive branch affairs.
  Fast forward four decades, and we now see the Roberts court repeatedly
  overturning the rulings of lower court judges who have resisted Trump’s
  lawless actions. Just how far federal courts should go in reining in
  presidents is a perennial question that has divided jurists and politicians
  for years. What disturbs some supreme court watchers about the present moment
  is the context in which this wrangling is happening: with Trump so brazenly
  challenging the rule of law, is now the time for the top court to be clipping
  the wings of federal judges struggling to hold him back? As Graves points out,
  Roberts’s approach to lower court judges would be more understandable if it
  were consistently applied – or to put it another way, if he actually did
  behave like a neutral umpire free of political motives. “When a Democrat was
  in the White House, the chief justice went out of his way to block student
  loan debt relief, which was a modest effort by the Biden administration that
  in no way compares to the extreme actions that Roberts is now greenlighting
  for Trump.” Roberts’s early musings on the importance of a strong executive in
  the White House, so evident in those Reagan memos, run as a theme through his
  jurisprudence. It culminated with him authoring Trump v US. That was last
  year’s shattering ruling that gave Trump absolute immunity from criminal
  prosecution for his official presidential acts. The chief justice justified
  this extraordinary decision to shield the president from basic accountability
  by invoking the desire of the framers – the men who drafted the US
  constitution – for a “vigorous” and “energetic” executive. He conveniently
  overlooked the framers’ other core executive requirements: “responsibility”,
  and an obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed”. Trump
  has repeatedly ignored that duty over the past six months. He has disregarded
  congressional laws, such as the 1974 Impoundment Control Act which limits the
  president’s power to withhold funds approved by Congress from federal
  agencies. He has also violated constitutional laws such as birthright
  citizenship – a right that is written in plain, unambiguous English into the
  14th amendment. Graves believes that Roberts’s immunity ruling has had
  devastating consequences. “It paved the way for Trump’s return. It sent a
  signal to some sections of the American people that not only did Trump do no
  wrong, he could do no wrong – that if he returned to power, he would be above
  the law.” *** When Trump did return to the White House on 20 January, Roberts
  was widely seen as the last great hope for constitutional government. The
  chief justice would draw a line in the sand that Trump, thirsting for
  supremacy, would not be allowed to cross. Initially there were signs that such
  hopes might be founded. At 1am on 19 April – in the early hours of a Saturday
  morning – the supreme court issued an order that could be deemed to draw
  precisely such a line in the sand. It barred the Trump administration from
  deporting undocumented Venezuelans summarily to a notorious prison in El
  Salvador. The Roberts court had struck a blow for due process and, yes, the
  rule of law. The rosy glow of that pre-dawn intervention did not last for
  long. Since then the supreme court has used the shadow docket to grant Trump
  virtually his every wish, trampling over the separation of powers in the
  process. The most recent emergency order from 23 July allowed Trump to fire
  without cause three Democratic members of the federal Consumer Product Safety
  Commission. The decision was a direct affront to Congress, which had created
  the agency and only permitted the president to fire its commissioners on
  grounds of neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Just days earlier, the justices
  cleared the way for Trump to eviscerate the federal education department even
  though, as Sotomayor pointed out in one of her withering dissents, only
  Congress has the power to do so. And a week before that they gave the green
  light to the mass firing of thousands of federal workers, delivering a
  potential death knell to the US government as we know it. The court’s most
  egregious shadow docket rulings relate to cases in which Trump has not only
  violated the law, he has done so in open defiance of federal judges. On 23
  June and 3 July the justices released two emergency orders which had the
  combined effect of allowing the Trump administration to deport people to third
  countries such as South Sudan, a nation devastated by civil war and with a
  shaky human rights record. Federal judges in lower courts had expressly
  forbidden the deportations, ordering that the individuals had to be given a
  chance to prove they faced torture in those destinations. Under the
  international Convention against Torture, to which the US is a signatory, it
  is prohibited to expel people to places where they might be subjected to such
  illegal treatment. The Trump administration ignored the court rulings,
  deporting the individuals regardless. Roberts’s willingness to preside over a
  court that sides with Trump over the judiciary itself, even in cases involving
  brazen defiance of federal judges, has profoundly shocked the legal world.
  “The supreme court is the ultimate guardian of the rule of law, and it appears
  to have abdicated that role,” said Amrit Singh, director of the Rule of Law
  Lab at New York University. “The court has clearly indicated that it is
  willing to tolerate the Trump administration’s violation of federal court
  orders.” Singh’s charitable interpretation is that Roberts was trying to
  “appease the Trump administration to avoid direct confrontation”. Were that
  the case, she said, the chief justice was pursuing an “extremely dangerous
  strategy”. “He is letting the Trump administration get away with it. When
  district court orders are ignored, and the supreme court turns a blind eye,
  then the rule of law has already been sacrificed.” Some supreme court watchers
  have cautioned against assuming that the justices’ emergency rulings are their
  final word. Bob Bauer, Barack Obama’s White House counsel who co-chaired Joe
  Biden’s presidential commission on the supreme court, has pointed out that the
  court has yet to rule on several of Trump’s biggest provocations. They include
  birthright citizenship, and the use of the Alien Enemies Act under which
  third-country deportations are being carried out. “There is yet no final
  resolution of these issues,” Bauer has written in his Substack, Executive
  Functions. It is true that, if and when those issues are fully addressed by
  the supreme court, Roberts could surprise us once again. He could dust off his
  old umpire’s uniform, revisit his carefully crafted posture as a moderate
  institutionalist, and confound us all – Trump included – with nuanced rulings.
  But for his longtime friend Luttig, that is besides the point. The price of
  what Roberts is doing here and now, in the legal darkness of the shadow
  docket, is just too high. “The supreme court has pulled the rug out from under
  the lower federal courts, and it has done so deliberately and knowingly,”
  Luttig said. “The chief justice has no higher obligation than to protect the
  federal judiciary from attacks by this president, and in my view he has
  utterly failed.” This article was amended on 21 August 2025 to correct that
  John Roberts administered an oath of office to Donald Trump; he did not take
  the oath as previously stated.

The chief justice would draw a line in the sand that Trump, thirsting for supremacy, would not be allowed to cross. Initially there were signs that such hopes might be founded. At 1am on 19 April – in the early hours of a Saturday morning – the supreme court issued an order that could be deemed to draw precisely such a line in the sand. It barred the Trump administration from deporting undocumented Venezuelans summarily to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The Roberts court had struck a blow for due process and, yes, the rule of law. The rosy glow of that pre-dawn intervention did not last for long. Since then the supreme court has used the shadow docket to grant Trump virtually his every wish, trampling over the separation of powers in the process. The most recent emergency order from 23 July allowed Trump to fire without cause three Democratic members of the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission. The decision was a direct affront to Congress, which had created the agency and only permitted the president to fire its commissioners on grounds of neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Just days earlier, the justices cleared the way for Trump to eviscerate the federal education department even though, as Sotomayor pointed out in one of her withering dissents, only Congress has the power to do so. And a week before that they gave the green light to the mass firing of thousands of federal workers, delivering a potential death knell to the US government as we know it. The court’s most egregious shadow docket rulings relate to cases in which Trump has not only violated the law, he has done so in open defiance of federal judges. On 23 June and 3 July the justices released two emergency orders which had the combined effect of allowing the Trump administration to deport people to third countries such as South Sudan, a nation devastated by civil war and with a shaky human rights record. Federal judges in lower courts had expressly forbidden the deportations, ordering that the individuals had to be given a chance to prove they faced torture in those destinations. Under the international Convention against Torture, to which the US is a signatory, it is prohibited to expel people to places where they might be subjected to such illegal treatment. The Trump administration ignored the court rulings, deporting the individuals regardless. Roberts’s willingness to preside over a court that sides with Trump over the judiciary itself, even in cases involving brazen defiance of federal judges, has profoundly shocked the legal world. “The supreme court is the ultimate guardian of the rule of law, and it appears to have abdicated that role,” said Amrit Singh, director of the Rule of Law Lab at New York University. “The court has clearly indicated that it is willing to tolerate the Trump administration’s violation of federal court orders.” Singh’s charitable interpretation is that Roberts was trying to “appease the Trump administration to avoid direct confrontation”. Were that the case, she said, the chief justice was pursuing an “extremely dangerous strategy”. “He is letting the Trump administration get away with it. When district court orders are ignored, and the supreme court turns a blind eye, then the rule of law has already been sacrificed.” Some supreme court watchers have cautioned against assuming that the justices’ emergency rulings are their final word. Bob Bauer, Barack Obama’s White House counsel who co-chaired Joe Biden’s presidential commission on the supreme court, has pointed out that the court has yet to rule on several of Trump’s biggest provocations. They include birthright citizenship, and the use of the Alien Enemies Act under which third-country deportations are being carried out. “There is yet no final resolution of these issues,” Bauer has written in his Substack, Executive Functions. It is true that, if and when those issues are fully addressed by the supreme court, Roberts could surprise us once again. He could dust off his old umpire’s uniform, revisit his carefully crafted posture as a moderate institutionalist, and confound us all – Trump included – with nuanced rulings. But for his longtime friend Luttig, that is besides the point. The price of what Roberts is doing here and now, in the legal darkness of the shadow docket, is just too high. “The supreme court has pulled the rug out from under the lower federal courts, and it has done so deliberately and knowingly,” Luttig said. “The chief justice has no higher obligation than to protect the federal judiciary from attacks by this president, and in my view he has utterly failed.” This article was amended on 21 August 2025 to correct that John Roberts administered an oath of office to Donald Trump; he did not take the oath as previously stated.
