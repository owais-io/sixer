  to Palace?

  After all the excitement surrounding the prospect of Savinho leaving
  Manchester City to join Tottenham, it may eventually transpire that the north
  London club are not willing to pay a whopping £70m for a winger who does not
  score. Therefore they need to construct a cunning plan B. Conveniently this is
  already on the big blackboard in the recruitment room. Maghnes Akliouche of
  Monaco is the second option and would be considerable cheaper than the
  Brazilian, coming in at about £47.5m. Tottenham, as is well-documented, are in
  talks over the signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace. If that goes
  through, one potential replacement for the winger at Selhurst Park is
  Southampton’s Tyler Dibling, who is still waiting for his big summer move
  after interest from Nottingham Forest, Everton and some Bundesliga clubs.
  Nicolas Jackson’s name has cropped up on more days than not in this daily
  column of transfer tittle-tattle. Needless to say, a lot of what is said about
  the striker has little substance but the latest talk may not head into the
  ether quite so soon. Aston Villa really need a new No 9 and Chelsea are quite
  eager to get rid of the Senegalese frontman, which could make this a
  gloriously symbiotic move for everyone. As the opening weekend proved, Wolves
  and West Ham really need to do some business before the window slams in their
  faces. It may not therefore be particularly helpful that they both want the
  same player, nor to mention it might be difficult to convince Barcelona’s Marc
  Casadó to leave his boyhood club to move to Premier League teams who will
  almost certainly struggle this season but it is worth a try. Everything is
  going swimmingly at Marseille after one game this season. And by that, we mean
  it’s absolute chaos. An opening night defeat at Rennes on Friday concluded
  with the England Under-21s winger Jonathan Rowe having a good old fashioned
  dustup with his teammate Adrien Rabiot, a man no stranger to controversy. Both
  were almost immediately placed on the transfer list. The good news for Rowe is
  he is already in talks with Bologna about going to Italy, only a couple of
  months after completing a permanent move to the south of France from Norwich.
  Rabiot, one assumes, will be linked with every Premier League club, as he has
  been for most of the past decade. Jamie Vardy is still looking for a new club
  after leaving Leicester. The 38-year-old still has plenty to give despite his
  veteran status and has been linked with a move north of the border to Celtic
  where he would link up with his former Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers. “Listen,
  I would not speak about any individual player,” said Rodgers of the rumours.
  “Of course I worked really well with Jamie, he was brilliant for me in my time
  at Leicester. But there’s been so many names floated about. I wouldn’t
  disclose either way.” Ipswich are keen to bolster their ranks in midfield and
  make a cheeky little loan offer to sign Newcastle’s Lewis Miley but Eddie Howe
  is eager to keep the 19-year-old at St James’ Park and give him more of a
  chance. Elsewhere in the Championship, the former West Ham forward Dapo
  Afolayan may leave St Pauli this month and is wanted by Leicester, West Brom
  and Blackburn. There’s also interest in Belgium from Gent and Genk.
