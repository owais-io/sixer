  A friend recently shared a post from the satirical site Reductress. It
  depicted a woman, arms held triumphantly aloft, beneath the headline: “She Did
  It! This Woman Was Able To Confirm That Everyone Was Not Mad At Her!” When I
  asked her about it, my friend admitted that it was partly a ploy to flush out
  anyone who might indeed be mad at her. “The way I deal with it externally is
  to make a joke about it,” she said. “And a few people did message me – also
  sort of in jest, but not really – to be like ‘Don’t worry, I’m not mad at
  you!’” I sometimes feel the same heart-sinking insecurity. If I haven’t heard
  from a friend in a while, or their most recent message seemed a bit curt, my
  mind throws up the question: did I do something wrong? In many ways it’s a
  senseless reaction – I’ve no real reason to believe I’ve offended or upset
  them; they’re probably just busy. Yet I can’t shake the feeling. Especially if
  I’m tired, stressed or premenstrual, I can convince myself that my friend
  actively hates me – and that any evidence that they ever enjoyed my company or
  appreciated me as a person was fake. I surveyed my friends about the
  phenomenon, and it seems common. Some act on the insecurity, asking if they’ve
  done something wrong. “It’s become a running joke,” said Cat. Others fret,
  second-guessing their last interaction or reading into text messages. Lauren
  said that one- or two-word responses, full stops or use of her name put her
  “immediately on high alert”. Even reassuring language can set off these fears.
  “I actually don’t think I could even hear ‘No worries’ without assuming
  sarcasm,” said Michael. Why are we so quick to assume that our friends are mad
  at us – or even itching to drop us? *** “When we fear that our friends are mad
  at us, it feels really convincing,” says psychotherapist Meg Josephson. “We’re
  trying to alleviate this anxiety, so we seek reassurance – ‘Was I annoying?
  Was I weird?’ – but it’s not getting to the actual feeling that’s underneath
  it.” In her new book Are You Mad At Me?, Josephson says this impulse is driven
  by a desire to please and be affirmed. The so-called “fawn response” is one
  way we respond to threats, whether real (physical danger) or perceived (your
  friend taking longer than usual to text you back). “The fawn response is about
  appeasing the threat, so that you can feel safe,” says Josephson. “Your
  immediate instinct is to be ‘Are we OK?’ – or to compliment them, or be
  helpful to them, so that you can defuse the perceived tension.” Less well
  known than the fight or flight response, it is often developed in childhood in
  response to critical or emotionally neglectful parents, or a volatile home
  environment, Josephson says. Women are especially susceptible, being
  socialised to put others at ease. The fawn response isn’t bad; often, it keeps
  the peace. Yet over time, it can become compulsive, stoking a cycle of
  reassurance-seeking. We might intellectually understand that a friend isn’t
  upset with us – but those “old ways of being” bite hard, Josephson says.
  “Something was learned: ‘I need to try harder and do more to be loved.’” The
  pattern is self-defeating in two ways. First, it conceives of friendship as
  conditional, which can “keep people at a distance”, Josephson says. Worse
  still, assuming everyone is annoyed with you can become a self-fulfilling
  prophecy. “When we seek reassurance, that can put quite a strain on the
  relationship.” Lauren, who reads into short text messages, has found this.
  “Pressing too hard” sometimes makes the fear a reality: “I almost always wish
  I never asked, because it almost always backfires.” The attempted mind-reading
  and “anxious rumination” can become exhausting, says Josephson. It also
  doesn’t actually protect you against conflict. “Sometimes people will be mad
  at you,” Josephson says. “They will misjudge you, misunderstand you,
  misperceive you.” The key is understanding that it is not the end of the world
  – or a friendship. “Especially if we grew up in more volatile homes, where
  conflict was brushed under the rug or we didn’t witness disagreement handled
  in a safe way, we learn to fear conflict” as terminal, Josephson says.
  “Actually, in healthy relationships, a little bit of friction is really good,
  because it means both people can have differing opinions.” Conflict is not
  only inevitable; it can even be healing, she adds, demonstrating that
  disagreement or discomfort doesn’t have to come at the cost of intimacy.
  “Repair is what leads to closeness.” *** With nearly 600,000 followers across
  TikTok and Instagram, Josephson often hears how social media worsens social
  anxiety. The lack of nonverbal cues and other context make it easy to
  misinterpret the tone of messages. Additionally, “because there are so many
  ways to connect, there’s also so many ways to feel forgotten,” she says. “‘Why
  did they see my story, but not respond to my text?’” Since the fawn response
  often registers as a sense of urgency, technology can enable us to act on it.
  We might fire off a message seeking reassurance against our better judgement.
  So if your friend sends an unusually short text, instead of rushing to confirm
  that they hate you, Josephson advises pausing for 30 minutes, or even just a
  breath. “Slow down and acknowledge the feeling beneath it: ‘Am I anxious right
  now? What’s going on?’… Oftentimes, we find it’s just like a craving that sort
  of passes.” This helps to relax the cycle of reassurance-seeking, and convince
  “our bodies that we’re safe”, she says. “We’re bringing that unconscious
  pattern into the conscious mind, and that’s making a huge difference.” With
  practice, it’s possible to increase your tolerance for discomfort and gain
  more control over your response to triggers. But you can also try to trust
  your friends. When they say you weren’t weird or annoying, and that they
  didn’t reply because they’re busy, tired or distracted – “take what they say
  at face value,” says Josephson. More from Why am I like this: I’m an adult.
  Why do I regress under my parents’ roof? My friends made plans without me – is
  it weird to invite myself? Why do I feel like I’m stuck in a ‘waiting room’,
  hoping for my life to get started? I’m disagreeable – and it’s backed by
  science. Can I change my personality? Instead of inventing stories about why
  they might be mad at you, or seeking reassurance at every turn, trust that
  they will tell you if – or when – they are. “It’s a way to release control
  over things that we never had control over in the first place,” says Jacobson.
  After all, there’s no question you can ask, no magic sequence of words you can
  say that will fix someone’s perception of you. Even if there were, you might
  be robbing yourself of opportunities to grow, learn or deepen a bond. I think
  about all the times I forgot to text a friend back – it’s never because my
  feelings about them had changed. “Realising that no one’s thinking about us as
  much as we think they are is very liberating,” says Josephson. But for any of
  my friends who might have anxiously read this far, I’m happy to put your mind
  at ease – I am not mad at you. And if you’re mad at me – just let me know. Are
