  A male before- and after-school care staffer who was previously a New South
  Wales police officer has been charged with producing abuse material of
  children in his care, with authorities releasing a list of almost 60
  facilities where he worked. The Australian federal police allege 26-year-old
  David William James produced child abuse material of 10 children, aged between
  five and six, during his employment at six out-of-school hours (OOSH) care
  services in the northern suburbs of Sydney over three years, from April 2021
  to May 2024. The AFP said there was no evidence to suggest alleged offending
  took place at any of the facilities James worked at beyond the six identified
  by authorities. “It is important to note that all of the impacted families
  have been contacted by the AFP and NSW Health,” the AFP said. James was
  remanded in custody in October 2024; however, the accusations against him were
  only made public on Thursday after a court-ordered non-publication order was
  lifted. He has been charged with 13 offences, including nine counts of
  aggravated use of a child under 14 to make child abuse material; one count of
  using a child under 14 to make child abuse material; two counts of possessing
  child abuse material; and one count of contravening a warrant. James was
  initially arrested and charged with refusing to provide police with passcodes
  to his devices. After police gained access, officers located child abuse
  material and he was again arrested, the AFP alleged on Thursday. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email James worked with children as far back as 2018 across 58
  different after-school and vacation care services across Sydney, according to
  police. “AFP investigators have carefully scrutinised the available evidence
  to identify the scale and scope of the alleged offending,” the AFP acting
  assistant commissioner Brett James said. “There is no evidence to suggest the
  man’s alleged offending took place in out-of-school-hours facilities or other
  care providers which have not yet been contacted by law enforcement.” James
  worked at Knox Grammar high school from March 2018 to July 2020 and the YMCA
  in Bankstown in July 2018. His work history also shows he worked at OOSH
  services in Stanmore, Ultimo, Erskineville, St Ives and Fort Street. The AFP
  said the families of all alleged victims had been contacted. “This process
  resulted in letters being sent on 18 June 2025 to parents and carers of
  children who attended six Sydney-based care services where the man had been
  employed and where evidence of offending was identified by the AFP,” the
  police said in a statement on Thursday. NSW police confirmed on Thursday that
  James was a former officer. The force said he was employed as a probationary
  constable from December 2021 to September 2022. After failing to complete his
  probation, he stayed employed with the force in a civilian capacity until his
  resignation in May 2023. NSW police said that during his employment, James
  failed to seek the required approval to engage in secondary employment,
  therefore the “police were unaware of his concurrent role in the childcare
  sector”. “We acknowledge the seriousness of the allegations and condemn any
  behaviour that places our community’s most vulnerable members at risk,” NSW
  police said in a statement. “The NSWPF will continue to assist the AFP in its
  investigation and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all affected
  individuals. As this remains an ongoing investigation, it would be
  inappropriate to comment further at this time.” Brett James said police were
  “committed to supporting those families whose children’s innocence was
  allegedly violated by a man trusted to take care of them”. “Any form of child
  sexual abuse is confronting. Even more so when the alleged perpetrator is an
  individual trusted with the care of our youth,” he said. “If parents are
  concerned, please visit the website dedicated to supporting families and the
  community seeking further information about the AFP investigation.” James is
  due to appear in court on 21 August. During question time in parliament on
  Thursday, the education minister, Jason Clare, addressed the allegations
  against James, saying it was why the government’s childcare bill to improve
  child safety in the sector was so important. “The sickening (alleged) news we
  heard from the Australian federal police in the last few hours is a reminder
  of why this is so important,” he said. “There is a lot of work we need to do
  together to rebuild trust and confidence in the system that parents need to
  have confidence in.” Clare and the attorney general, Michelle Rowland, will
  meet their state and territory counterparts next month to reform the working
  with children checks system and discuss rules around CCTV footage. Sussan Ley
  stood up afterward and said the government had done good work but that the
  “next part is very difficult”. “Sitting down with the states and territories,
  as we have all done in ministerial positions in the past, can descend into a
  talkfest and ministers depart to their state and nothing happens. We cannot
  afford to have that this time,” she said.
