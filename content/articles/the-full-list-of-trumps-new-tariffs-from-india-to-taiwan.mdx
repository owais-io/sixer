webTitle: The full list of Trump’s new tariffs – from India to Taiwan
sectionName: US news

bodyText: >-
  “Reciprocal” tariffs ranging from 10% to 41% on imports into the US from
  dozens of countries have come into effect, as part of Donald Trump’s
  accelerating trade war. The new rates – announced by the White House a week
  ago, just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse – were in
  place as of a minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday. Brazil is hit
  by a 10% “reciprocal” tariff, but an executive order signed last week imposed
  a 40% additional levy linked to the prosecution of the country’s former
  president Jair Bolsonaro – taking the total to 50%. The White House has
  threatened an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, bringing its total
  tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil from
  Russia. However, India has 21 days to respond to the potential tariffs before
  they go into effect. The Guardian has a searchable table of the countries and
  the new tariff levels announced by the Trump administration. The White House
  has previously stated that goods from countries not listed would face a 10%
  tariff.
