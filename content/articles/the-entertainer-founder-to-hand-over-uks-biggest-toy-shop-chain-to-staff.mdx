  The family behind Britain’s biggest toy shop chain, The Entertainer, is
  handing over ownership of the business to its 1,900 employees. The retailer,
  which also includes the Early Learning Centre and Addo brands, will be
  transferred into a trust by the end of September, with payments to the family
  coming out of future profits. The valuation of the company has not been
  revealed. The sale comes after the family paid themselves a £15.6m dividend in
  the year to 27 January 2024, despite annual pre-tax profits falling 18% to
  £6.7m as sales dipped 3.7% to £238.3m. It was the family’s first dividend
  since 2019 when they took home £2.6m. A newly created employee advisory board
  will have influence over the future direction of the group and staff will be
  rewarded through tax-free bonuses based on the amount of profit the business
  generates. Founded in 1981 by Gary and Catherine Grant, The Entertainer has
  grown from one shop in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, to 160 stores and more than
  1,000 concessions in the UK in other retailers including Tesco and Marks &amp;
  Spencer. It also trades online and overseas. Gary Grant, who ran the business
  for many years until he was replaced by the former John Lewis executive Andrew
  Murphy in 2023, is to step down as chair in September when the deal completes.
  Grant’s sons, who both work at The Entertainer, will also step away at that
  time. Murphy’s experience at the UK’s biggest employee-owned business is
  expected to help shape the future of The Entertainer. Grant said: “Today marks
  a momentous day for the Grant family. It feels like only yesterday that my
  wife Catherine and I opened our first store in Amersham, and we could only
  have dreamed what heights the business would reach. “Over the last 44 years,
  we have invested our working lives into this business. All our children are
  shareholders, and our two oldest sons joined to work alongside us, 20 years
  ago – so it’s truly a family business. “This is a significant decision for the
  family, and one we haven’t taken lightly, but it feels like the right time to
  transfer our entire shareholding into an employee ownership trust.” He added:
  “We’d like to send our sincere thanks to all our employees, who have worked
  hard to make The Entertainer what it is today. When we started the business,
  we had a vision of keeping an unwavering focus on children and community
  through creating memories, inspiring wonder and delivering outstanding
  service. We couldn’t be more proud that this still remains at the heart of the
  business today.” The Entertainer is joining hundreds of other UK businesses
  including the retailer Richer Sounds and the vegetable-box seller Riverford
  that have handed control to staff. James de la Vingne, the chief executive of
  the Employee Ownership Association, said shifting to staff ownership could
  “futureproof beloved brands, root jobs in local communities and inject wealth
  into regional economies”. He added: “This is a bold and brilliant commitment
  to shared success and a stake in the future for the people who make the
  business what it is, arriving at a time when many retailers are rethinking
  what long-term success looks like. “I have no doubt that other familiar brands
  will follow The Entertainer’s example of what’s possible. The future of the
  high street is employee ownership, and the future is already happening.”
