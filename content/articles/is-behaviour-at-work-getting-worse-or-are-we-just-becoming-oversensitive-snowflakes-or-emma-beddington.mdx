  I would hate to be in human resources at the moment. Admittedly, as someone
  with no discernible people skills, I would always hate it, but I’ve been
  imagining the awkward HR meetings behind the scenes of the recent wave of
  “what is acceptable workplace behaviour” rulings from UK employment tribunals
  recently, and … oof! I’m thinking, particularly, of last week’s ruling on
  whether younger chatty workers disturbing an older colleague constitutes age
  discrimination (it didn’t), but there are many more. Comparing a colleague to
  Darth Vader in an online personality test resulted in a £30,000 compensation
  award. Leaving someone out of the tea round could contribute to unfair
  constructive dismissal. Sighing at a colleague could be discriminatory. An air
  kiss wasn’t harassment and neither was telling a manager his work was messy.
  Allocating a senior employee a “low-status desk” can be seen as a demotion. Of
  course, any acrimonious departure is about more than one thing. These are
  mostly cherrypicked contributory factors; easy headlines about situations that
  surely involved a complex brew of circumstances and personalities. But it does
  look like more cases considering how we should behave at work in quite
  granular ways are reaching tribunals. So, what’s going on? For a start, is
  workplace behaviour getting worse? That old “Covid meant we forgot our
  manners” cliche is certainly applied to workplaces – the idea being that too
  much time in slippers and sweats made us ruder and more self-centred, and we
  are now bringing rather too much of our unpalatable “whole selves” to work.
  But as a veteran of a variety of office environments, 1997-2010, I doubt this
  is the explanation. From flying office equipment to heavy lunchtime drinking
  and a litany of extremely off-colour personal comments, I witnessed some truly
  lawless behaviour (including from lawyers). People have never needed the
  excuse of a global pandemic to hang their sweaty shorts on the office door
  knob or make each other cry – there’s a reason I was congratulated by LinkedIn
  recently on my many years of self-employment. (OK, the reason is I was made
  redundant after writing about my colleagues on my blog – I didn’t say I was
  immune to behaving badly – but the stuff I saw certainly made me less keen to
  find another office-based job.) Actually, I suspect shifting mores (plus
  decades of anti-discrimination legislation) mean behaviour in most British
  workplaces is far better than it used to be. So, are we getting less tolerant
  of co-workers and the minor irritations sharing a workplace inevitably
  involve? These rulings are often framed as either “Gen Z are oversensitive
  snowflakes” or “today’s workers are lazy, cynical outrage-mongers looking for
  a payout”. On the former, there probably is a degree of generational friction
  – we have a highly intergenerational workforce (51% of businesses employ three
  or more generations) and surveys suggest that has meant more age-based
  conflicts around communication style and working methods (it’s also something
  you often hear anecdotally). But most of these cases don’t even involve gen Z
  workers. The second complaint feels like a riff on the age-old, always
  fallacious “nobody wants to work” discourse, rehashed back through the 19th
  century and beyond (surely one day we’ll discover a Mesopotamian tablet on
  which someone has chiselled this exact complaint). People do want (and need)
  to work – just differently. Covid didn’t make us feral slobs, but it was an
  inflection point, showing that work need not be business as usual. Employees
  regularly express a desire for more work-life balance and flexibility, but
  instead, many employers are hustling them back on site, and an expanding
  culture of workplace surveillance (HSBC is the latest employer to go down this
  unpopular route according to a Reuters’ recent report) further erodes trust
  and goodwill. Meanwhile, jobs that were traditionally vocations – teaching,
  healing, caring – are made harder and less rewarding every year by
  hollowed-out budgets. When you are not particularly happy at work – only one
  in three workers report they’re thriving and employee wellbeing is declining
  according to recent Gallup research – small grievances and annoyances become
  harder to overlook: the microwave smells worse; being left off the team
  bowling invitation rankles more; the no-headphones calls in the open plan
  office seem louder and longer. Unless and until things change, I bet the HR
  headaches continue. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist
