  This blog is closing now but please continue to follow our live coverage on
  our new blog here. Thank you for reading. In Australia, the conservative
  opposition appears likely to support any government decision to send
  Australian peacekeepers to Ukraine if the US-European talks lead to peace.
  When Labor prime minister Anthony Albanese previously said Australia would
  consider requests to join a peacekeeping force, then opposition leader Peter
  Dutton dismissed it as a “thought bubble”. But Dutton’s successor, Sussan Ley,
  has now indicated the opposition is open to Australia joining a global effort
  in Ukraine. A Ley spokesperson said: We will work constructively with the
  government in our national interest when it comes to our international
  relationships. The opposition unequivocally supported Ukraine in its fight
  against Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion, the spokesperson added.
  Australian Associated Press also reports that Ukraine’s ambassador to
  Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, said bipartisanship on his country’s security
  was vital. I welcome that decision, I think that’s a very smart decision.
  We’ve traditionally had that bipartisan support and I think it’s the right
  thing to do. British prime minister Keir Starmer has given some more comments,
  hailing “real progress” at the summit. Speaking after the event, Starmer
  described the talks as “good and constructive”, adding: “There was a real
  sense of unity between the European leaders that were there, and President
  Trump and President Zelensky.” The prime minister highlighted “two material
  outcomes” from the talks, firstly that the coalition of the willing “will now
  work with the US” on security guarantees. “That’s really important for
  security in Ukraine, for security in Europe, and for security in the UK,”
  Starmer said. “The other material outcome was the agreement that there will
  now be a bilateral agreement between President Putin and President Zelensky,
  that was after a phone call between President Trump and President Putin during
  the course of this afternoon, followed by a trilateral that will add in Trump.
  That is a recognition of the principle that on some of these issues, whether
  it’s territory or the exchange of prisoners, or the very serious issue of the
  return of children, that is something where Ukraine must be at the table.
  These were the two outcomes that were the most important coming out of today.
  They’re positive outcomes, there was a real sense of unity. We’ve made real
  progress today. On Monday Volodymyr Zelenskyy garnered compliments from both
  Donald Trump and the White House press pool for his formal jacket and
  trousers, after criticism of the clothes he chose to wear for his first visit
  the White House in February. Womenswear Daily has interviewed the Ukrainian
  man who designed the new suit. Viktor Anisimov told the magazine that
  Zelenskyy’s suit was not made in response to the previous meeting. “It’s not
  about the suit – it’s about what happens to Ukraine,” Anisimov told the
  magazine. During the talks Donald Trump and European Commission president
  Ursula von der Leyen reportedly spoke about the issue of missing children.
  Later, Von der Leyen tweeted that “every single Ukrainian child abducted by
  Russia must be returned to their families”. Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, had
  raised the plight of children in Ukraine and Russia in a personal letter to
  Russian president Vladimir Putin, two White House officials said on Friday
  when Trump met Putin at a summit in Alaska. Trump hand-delivered that letter
  to Putin. As many as 35,000 Ukrainian children are still missing and thought
  to be held in Russia or Russian-occupied territories, according to an American
  team of experts, with families saying they are being forced to take desperate
  and risky measures to try to rescue them. Debris from destroyed Ukrainian
  drones sparked fires at an oil refinery and a hospital roof in Russia’s
  Volgograd region, the administration of the southwestern Russian region said
  on Tuesday in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “Firefighters are working
  on site trying to contain and extinguish the fires,” the administration cited
  the region’s governor, Andrei Bocharov, as saying in its post, which was
  reported by Reuters. “According to preliminary information, there are no
  injuries.” It’s 10.25pm in Washington DC and here’s a recap of the day’s key
  events so far: A Ukraine peace deal appeared far from imminent after Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy and European leaders met Donald Trump at the White House and the US
  president ruled out a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, despite last week
  warning Moscow of “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin didn’t agree to
  halt the fighting. Trump said while sitting with the leaders on Monday: “All
  of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting
  peace. Maybe something like that could happen. As of this moment, it’s not
  happening.” Trump told Zelenskyy the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s
  security in any deal to end the war, though the extent of any assistance was
  not immediately clear. “I believe this is a major step forward,” Zelenskyy
  said, also saying security guarantees for Ukraine would probably be worked out
  within 10 days. Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with
  Zelenskyy, according to Trump and European leaders, but Russia has not
  confirmed any meeting. Trump claimed on his Truth Social platform that
  arrangements were under way for a Zelenskyy-Putin meeting and, later, a
  trilateral meeting between the two along with Trump. The Russian president has
  previously resisted a one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s leader said
  it was ready to meet with Russia in “any format” and that territorial issues
  are “something we will leave between me and Putin”. German chancellor
  Friedrich Merz said Putin told Trump in a call during the White House meeting
  that he was ready to meet Zelenskyy “within the next two weeks”. Kremlin aide
  Yuri Ushakov said Putin and Trump only discussed the “idea” of direct
  Russia-Ukraine talks in Monday’s phone call and that Putin told Trump he was
  open to the “idea” of direct talks with Ukraine. Trump described his meeting
  with Zelenskyy and the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Finland,
  the European Union and Nato as “a very good, early step for a war that has
  been going on for almost four years”. He also wrote on social media that
  “everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine”.
  French president Emmanuel Macron called for stepping up sanctions against
  Russia if Vladimir Putin does not move forward on peace with Ukraine.German
  chancellor Friedrich Merz says Ukraine should not be forced to surrender its
  Donbas region to Russia in talks, likening it to the US giving up Florida.
  Finnish president Alexander Stubb said the main agreement from the White House
  meeting was that the killing had to end and that it remained to be seen if
  Putin had the courage to meet Zelenskyy. “Putin is rarely to be trusted,”
  Stubb said. Trump, however, seemed clearly swayed by Putin from their talks in
  Alaska last Friday and echoed the Russian president’s talking points, saying
  several times on Monday that ending the war was “up to” both Zelenskyy and
  Putin – rather than just Putin, the invader. Trump also said: “We also need to
  discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the
  current line of contact – that means the war zone.” Ukraine will promise to
  buy $100bn of US weapons financed by Europe as part of a deal to get
  guarantees from the US for its security if there is a peace settlement with
  Russia, according to news reports. In stark contrast to the heated exchange
  during Zelenskyy’s first trip to Trump’s White House in February, the
  Ukrainian president’s charm offensive this time around looked to pay off,
  allowing him to emerge unscathed. Zelenskyy – who wore a black military-style
  suit and presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Melania Trump
  in response to her letter to Putin – said this meeting with Trump was his
  “best” so far. Here’s a fresh video of the proceedings in the White House as
  Donald Trump ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine while Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
  his European allies visited the US president. Trump said he had called
  Vladimir Putin and begun arrangements for a meeting between the Russian
  president and Ukrainian leader, also saying that “all of us would obviously
  prefer an immediate ceasefire ... as of this moment it’s not happening”.
  However, the leaders of France and Germany refused to accept defeat on the
  issue, with German chancellor Friedrich Merz insisting “we would all like to
  see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking place
  without one, and French president Emmanuel Macron also backing the idea of a
  truce as a “necessity”. Here’s the video wrap of the Washington meeting:
  Ukraine will promise to buy $100bn of US weapons financed by Europe as part of
  a deal to get guarantees from the US for its security if there is a peace
  settlement with Russia, according to reports. Warren Murray writes in our
  Ukraine war briefing that the Financial Times cited a document seen by its
  reporter, while the Washington Post said it had also confirmed the proposal.
  The FT added that Ukraine and the US would also strike a $50bn deal to produce
  drones with Ukrainian companies. The drone news may be repeat of recent
  similar announcements. You can read the full Ukraine briefing here: Returning
  now to the Finnish president’s comments after the White House meeting,
  Alexander Stubb said his Russian counterpart was not trustworthy. “Putin is
  rarely to be trusted,” Stubb told Finnish reporters, cited by Reuters. “So now
  it remains to be seen whether he has the courage to come to this type of
  meeting. Does he have the courage to come to a trilateral meeting, or is he
  once again playing for time? French president Emmanuel Macron has called for
  stepping up sanctions against Russia if Vladimir Putin does not move forward
  on peace with Ukraine. “President Trump believes we can get an agreement and
  believes that President Putin also wants a peace accord,” Macron told
  reporters after the talks at the White House. “But if at the end this process
  is met by refusal, we are also ready to say that we need to increase
  sanctions.” Macron pointed to recent secondary sanctions imposed by the Trump
  administration on India, a major buyer of Russian energy as western nations
  cut back due to sanctions over Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Macron said the
  secondary sanctions on India had “had a lot of effects”, Agence France-Presse
  reports. Over the weekend, Trump publicly again pressured Ukraine to concede
  territory, siding with Putin and not Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has insisted on
  defending all territory that Russia has taken by force. Asked by reporters if
  Trump had said that concessions were necessary before any US security
  guarantees to Ukraine, Macron said: “No, that wasn’t discussed at all. We’re
  well away from that.” He said he hoped Russia and Ukraine would resume contact
  “in the coming days” with a potential three-way summit involving Trump, Putin
  and Zelenskyy “in two to three weeks”. As Donald Trump touted his bona fides
  as the so-called “peacemaker-in-chief” during talks over Ukraine at the White
  House, he made two big claims: that he wants peace deals instead of
  ceasefires, and that he has ended six wars since he became president. But as
  Andrew Roth explains, in Trump’s haste to hammer out a peace deal in Ukraine,
  he is playing fast and loose with the truth. Trump and his administration have
  claimed to have helped settle the conflicts between Israel and Iran, the
  Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand, India and
  Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia … On the subject of
  ceasefires, by Trump’s own admission, he has often been seeking them in these
  conflicts. Now, he has sought to rewrite the record, piling pressure on
  Ukraine. Trump’s declaration that he was not seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine
  came after last week’s meeting Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where the Russian
  president initially demanded that Ukraine cede control over territory in the
  country’s southeast before negotiating a ceasefire. The question is crucial to
  the sequencing of an eventual peace in Ukraine. You can read Roth’s full
  explainer here: French president Emmanuel Macron says any future peace deal
  between Russia and Ukraine cannot restrict the size of Kyiv’s military. Macron
  told reporters that Donald Trump and European leaders had agreed on the need
  for a “robust Ukrainian army that can resist any attempted attack” and that it
  would not have “any limitation in number or capacity of arms”. Macron also
  said on Monday the White House talks did not discuss Ukrainian territorial
  concessions, AFP is reporting. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is saying security
  guarantees for Kyiv will likely be worked out within the next 10 days.
  “Security guarantees will probably be ‘unpacked’ by our partners, and more and
  more details will emerge,” the Ukrainian president said at a broadcast press
  briefing after his meetings in Washington DC. “All of this will somehow be
  formalised on paper within the next week to 10 days,” he said on Tuesday,
  quoted by Reuters. Zelenskyy also said territorial issues related to a
  potential peace agreement would be worked out between Ukraine and Russia.
  German chancellor Friedrich Merz says Ukraine should not be forced to
  surrender its Donbas region to Russia in talks, likening it to the US giving
  up a state. “The Russian demand that Kyiv give up the free parts of Donbas
  corresponds, to put it bluntly, to a proposal for the United States to have to
  give up Florida,” Merz told reporters after the White House talks on Monday.
  Merz said Putin and Trump – in their call in the midst of the talks – “agreed
  that there would be a meeting between the Russian president and the Ukrainian
  president within the next two weeks”. Merz, quoted by Agence France-Presse,
  also said Trump voiced a readiness to offer security guarantees to Ukraine,
  even though the US president put the onus on Europeans. The German chancellor
  said: The bottom line is that the United States of America is prepared to
  provide security guarantees and to coordinate this with the Europeans. There
  will be appropriate security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace
  agreement. Trump has repeatedly ruled out Ukraine entering Nato, siding with
  Putin who has called the step a provocation. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov has
  said Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump only discussed the “idea” of direct
  Russia-Ukraine talks in Monday’s phone call. Russia’s Tass news agency quoted
  the aide as saying Putin told Trump that he was open to the “idea” of direct
  talks with Ukraine. Tass, cited by Agence France-Presse, quoted Ushakov as
  saying: In the course of the further phone conversation, Vladimir Putin and
  Donald Trump expressed support for the continuation of direct negotiations
  between the delegations of Russia and Ukraine. In this regard, in particular,
  the idea was discussed that it would be necessary to study the possibility of
  raising the level of representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian sides, that
  is, those representatives who participate in the aforementioned direct
  negotiations. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is ready for a bilateral meeting
  with Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, Agence France-Presse is
  reporting. Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump he was ready to meet Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy within a fortnight, German chancellor Friedrich Merz has told
  reporters. Merz said that Putin and Trump – in their phone call in the midst
  of the White House talks – “agreed that there would be a meeting between the
  Russian president and the Ukrainian president within the next two weeks”,
  Agence France-Presse reports. Finland’s president has said the main agreement
  from the White House meeting was that the killing has to end. Alexander Stubb
  said Donald Trump felt like it was a good idea to call Vladimir Putin and
  propose a bilateral meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin, adding that
  it remained to be seen if Putin had the courage to come to such a meeting,
  Reuters is reporting Putin could not be trusted, Stubb also said. It was
  reported earlier that Trump interrupted his White House talks with European
  leaders to make the call to the Russian president. Donald Trump also said in
  his Truth Social post that during today’s Washington talks he and European
  leaders discussed security guarantees for Ukraine and “which Guarantees would
  be provided by the various European Countries, with a coordination with the
  United States of America”. Earlier in the day, when asked if future security
  guarantees for Ukraine could involve American troops, the US president didn’t
  rule it out. Trump said: When it comes to security there’s going to be a lot
  of help … They’re the first line of defence because they’re there, Europe, but
  we’re going to help them out also, we’ll be involved. Six European leaders
  joined Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the Washington meeting with Donald Trump –
  here’s what the scenes looked like. Donald Trump has taken to social media to
  say arrangements are under way for a future meeting between Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin and, later, a trilateral meeting between the two
  along with Trump. The US president posted on his Truth Social platform that
  today’s meeting in Washington was “a very good, early step for a War that has
  been going on for almost four years”. He said vice-president JD Vance,
  secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were
  “coordinating with Russia and Ukraine”. Trump said: Everyone is very happy
  about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine. At the conclusion of the
  meetings, I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting,
  at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President
  Zelenskyy. After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would
  be the two Presidents, plus myself. Putin has previously resisted a one-on-one
  meeting with Zelenskyy. That’s all from me Lucy Campbell for today. My
  colleague Adam Fulton will be along shortly to steer you through the rest of
  the day’s news. The reporter who criticised Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not
  dressing formally enough during his last meeting with Donald Trump said the
  Ukrainian president looked ‘fabulous’ in his suit during their latest meeting
  at the White House – and our video colleagues have clipped the exchange here:
  Ukraine’s Air Force said early on Tuesday (local time) that two Russian
  strategic bombers took off from Russian airfields for a possible attack on
  Ukraine. “We will provide additional updates if the situation changes,” the
  Air Force said on the Telegram messaging app. A spokesperson for Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy has told NBC News: “The meeting has ended, but European leaders and
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are staying for now in DC to continue
  talks, potentially in another format.” European Commission president Ursula
  von der Leyen posted an image of the leaders alongside Donald Trump inside the
  White House with a message of unity and stressing the need for strong security
  guarantees for Ukraine. We now have confirmation from the White House that
  Donald Trump’s talks with European leaders in the east room has concluded.
  Reuters and AFP are also reporting that Donald Trump paused his meeting with
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the other European leaders to call Vladimir Putin.
  Reuters cites an EU diplomat, while AFP cites an unnamed source close to the
  talks. At the time of writing, Donald Trump has ruled out a ceasefire in
  Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his European allies visited the White House
  to push for US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term peace deal.
  The US president, who only last week warned Russia of “very severe
  consequences” if Vladimir Putin failed to agree to a halt the fighting, made
  clear today that he had reversed his position. Later, sitting with the other
  European leaders in the east room, he acknowledged: “All of us would obviously
  prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe
  something like that could happen. As of this moment, it’s not happening.” But
  some of the European allies refused to accept defeat on the ceasefire issue,
  mindful that the lack of one allows Putin more time to wage his war of
  aggression. Friedrich Merz, the chancellor of Germany, insisted that “we would
  all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking
  place without one. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, also backed the idea
  of a “truce” as a “necessity”, adding: “We all support this idea.” By way of
  strategy, the leaders led with praise and gratitude for Trump, and several
  notably mirrored his language (for example, saying they wanted to “stop the
  killing”) and stressing the importance of protecting Ukraine’s children,
  referencing his wife Melania’s letter sent over the weekend to Putin urging
  him to consider children impacted by the war. Trump, though, was clearly
  swayed by Putin in Alaska and echoing his talking points. He said several
  times today that ending the war was “up to” both Zelenskyy and Putin (as
  opposed to just Putin, the invader). Ominously for Ukraine, Trump also added:
  “We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into
  consideration the current line of contact – that means the war zone.” But he
  said Putin had accepted there would be security guarantees for Ukraine as part
  of a peace deal and that the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s safety, which
  Kyiv has long said would be essential for a lasting peace. “When it comes to
  security, there’s going to be a lot of help,” Trump said. He declined to rule
  out sending US troops to Ukraine, noting it would be a discussion point with
  European leaders. But he also made it clear that European countries would be
  expected to mostly carry the burden, saying: “They are a first line of defence
  because they’re there. But we’ll help them out.” Several of the leaders
  emphasised the importance of the security guarantees to deter Russia from
  attacking again. Macron said: “The first one is clearly a credible Ukrainian
  army for the years and decades to come.” Europe was also clear about carrying
  its “fair share” of the burden, he said, “so you can count on this as we can
  continue”. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian PM, said: ‘We will talk about many
  important topics. The first one is security guarantees, how to be sure that it
  won’t happen again, which is the precondition of every kind of peace.” Trump
  also expressed hope that the talks with Zelenskyy could lead to a trilateral
  meeting with Putin. “I think if everything works out well today we’ll have a
  [trilateral meeting], and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending
  the war when we do that.” And in stark contrast to the infamously heated
  exchange during Zelenskyy’s first trip to Trump’s White House in February, the
  Ukrainian president’s charm offensive this time around – which included
  wearing a black military-style suit and presenting a letter from his wife,
  Olena Zelenska, for Melania Trump in response to her letter to Putin – seemed
  to pay off, allowing him to emerge unscathed. But the state of play for
  Ukraine coming out of today’s meetings remains to be seen, and we’ll bring you
  more as soon as we get it. Sources in the Ukrainian delegation at the White
  House have told the BBC that talks involving Trump, Zelenskyy and European
  leaders have ended. We’ll bring you more as we get it. Donald Trump has
  interrupted his talks in Washington with European leaders to call Vladimir
  Putin, German newspaper Bild is reporting. Bild said the meetings are due to
  resume after the call, which Trump had initially said would take place
  afterwards. If there was a sign that Volodymyr Zelenskyy wasn’t going to be
  immediately voted off the island of the Donald Trump diplomacy show, it came
  early on when a familiar voice commended his choice of attire. “President
  Zelensky, you look fabulous in that suit,” said Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump
  pundit and member of the White House press corps, who had attacked him for
  wearing military fatigues during the infamous Oval Office meeting in February.
  “I said the same thing,” Trump added. “You are in the same suit,” Zelenskyy
  shot back, earning smiles and laughter from the room including the US
  president. “I changed, you did not.” Thus did Zelenskyy survive his first
  media appearance at the White House with Trump on Monday as the US president
  focused less on belittling the leader of a wartime ally than boasting – and in
  many cases exaggerating – his exploits as a peacemaker in world conflicts.
  Zelenskyy, dressed reluctantly in a black military-style suit to appease
  sticklers for protocol in the White House, largely sat by quietly as Trump
  claimed to have hammered out peace deals in six wars including one the veteran
  real estate developer said had taken place in the “Republic of the Condo”.
  From Trump there was hyperbole about his ability to broker peace deals,
  digressions to internal US political battles over mail-in ballots, nebulous
  declarations about how he would end the conflict and evasions over how he
  would do that without negotiating a ceasefire. But there were no explosions –
  which meant for Zelenskyy it probably went as well as it could have. He found
  a far more hospitable welcome from both Trump and JD Vance, and he kicked off
  the meeting with some high-level flattery, thanking Trump profusely for his
  efforts to end the conflict and praising Melania Trump for sending a letter to
  Putin about abducted Ukrainian children. There was little detail about the
  peace deal that Trump wanted to hammer out, except for the fact that he wanted
  to skip past a ceasefire – too difficult to actually negotiate – and go
  straight for a peace deal. And yet it appeared that all – or at least most –
  sides were keen to smooth over their differences in order to prevent Ukraine
  as being seen as the main obstruction to peace and of throwing the ball back
  to Putin. What has Vladimir Putin been up to today during the great
  international assembly at the White House? It appears to have been a drab day
  in Moscow all around, damp and grey and the Russian president hosting a
  meeting at the Kremlin with the acting governor of the Rostov region, Yury
  Slyusar. One gripping regional media headline is: “Putin noted a decrease in
  the pace of agricultural production in the Rostov region.” Meanwhile the
  attacks and the killing in Ukraine go on. That’s the end of the public remarks
  from the meeting between Trump and the European leaders. As they continue
  talks through the afternoon, we’ll bring you more as we get it. The UK’s prime
  minister Keir Starmer echoes Macron’s sentiments that “we all want peace” and
  guaranteeing Ukraine’s security guarantees the security of Europe as a whole.
  He adds that a trilateral meeting is “the sensible next step”. Security
  guarantees and a trilateral meeting with Russia, Ukraine and the US would be a
  “historic” step forward, he says. French president Emmanuel Macron, notably,
  opens his remarks by saying: “Everybody around this table is in favour of
  peace”. Discussions of security guarantees are “about the whole security of
  the European continent”, he tells Trump. He reiterates Merz’s comments about
  asking for a ceasefire “at least to stop the kiilling”, adding “we all support
  this idea”. Security guarantees would involve a strong Ukrainian army for
  “years and decades to come”, and a commitment from all those around the table
  to build security, he says. German chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasises that
  they would like to see a ceasefire. “To be honest, we all would like to see a
  ceasefire, the latest from the next meeting on,” he tells Trump. He adds that
  he “can’t imagine” the trilateral meeting will take place without one, urging
  the US president to put pressure on Russia to get one. Trump says “we’ll see …
  if we can do that” but, as he did earlier, highlights the “six wars|” he
  claims to have ended without a ceasefire. Invited to address the media,
  Zelenksyy says he and Trump had a “constructive” meeting, a “very good
  conversation”. He reiterates that Ukraine’s security depends on the European
  countries present and the United States. “This is very important the the US
  gives such strong signal and is ready for security guarantees,” he says. Trump
  says he would prefer an immediate to ceasefire in Ukraine while they work on a
  peace deal, but “as of this moment, it’s not happening”. Trump reiterates that
  he wants a trilateral meeting soon. Trump says after his summit with Putin he
  believes that peace is “within reach”. In a “significant step”, Putin agreed
  Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine, he says. He says the
  leaders at this meeting will be considering “who will do what, essentially”
  regarding Ukraine’s future security. Trump says he’s optimistic that the group
  can reach an agreement that will deter future aggression against Ukraine,
  adding: I actually think there won’t be. I even think that’s largely
  overrated. “I think the European nations are going to take a lot of the
  burden,” he says, reiterating that the US will be involved. “We’re going to
  help them.” The meeting will also discuss the “possible exchanges of
  territory”, he adds, ominously for Ukraine. There is a feed at the top of the
  blog if you’d like to follow the meeting live. That multilateral meeting has
  just started between Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the European
  leaders at the White House. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have just
  posed for a “family photo” with European leaders. Here it is, featuring UK
  prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime
  minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish president Alexander Stubb, and the president
  of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Well, the optics of this
  initial meeting were far friendlier than the last time these people were all
  in the Oval Office together, and Zelenskyy and the other European leaders will
  no doubt be very pleased with how suit-gate was handled, for example – heck,
  there was even laughing at times. But despite this lightheartedness, there
  were some worrying developments for Kyiv. Perhaps most key was Trump’s
  assertion that he’s decided he doesn’t need a ceasefire after all in order to
  negotiate a peace deal, after spending months demanding one from Russia and
  threatening sanctions and “severe consequences” if it didn’t comply. Things
  have clearly changed after his Alaska summit with Putin, who knows the US
  president wants peace more than anything and has played this up to his
  advantage by blaming others for being obstacles to ending the war. But there
  were glimmers of hope for Kyiv, notably Trump saying the US would help
  guarantee Ukraine’s security in a peace deal, giving Ukraine “very good
  protection”. Kyiv has long said this would essential for achieving a lasting
  peace. But Trump remained uncommitted on what level of specific security
  guarantees the US is willing to support, for instance whether its involvement
  would include an Article 5-style defence commitment and/or American boots on
  the ground, and also made clear that most of the burden would fall on Europe.
  Whether Trump can now be convinced once again by Zelenskyy and the Europeans
  that the onus is on Russia to end its war, and not on Ukraine to give up
  territory, in order to achieve peace remains to be seen. Earlier Trump was
  asked if he would offer Ukraine [Nato] Article 5-style security guarantees. He
  said this hasn’t been discussed yet but says of Kyiv: We will give them very
  good protection, very good security. That’s part of it. Trump says he just
  spoke to Putin indirectly, and will speak to him again after these meetings
  today “and we may or may not have a [trilateral meeting].” “He’s expecting my
  call when we’re finished with this meeting,” Trump says. Asked what security
  guarantees he needs from Trump, Zelenskyy says: “Everything.” He says he needs
  a strong Ukrainian army – weapons, training, equipment, intelligence. He says
  he will discuss this with “our partners”, the “big countries including the
  United States”. Going even more off topic, Trump claims mail-in ballots are
  “corrupt” and he wants to end them. (Putin apparently brought this up in
  Alaska on Friday, much to Trump’s delight). Trump goes on a tirade about Joe
  Biden, adding to an earlier detour where he appeared to justify his federal
  takeover of Washington DC by highlighting that people felt safe enough to go
  out to dinner again in the nation’s capital. Asked if there will still be
  “severe consequences” for Russia if a ceasefire isn’t agreed, as he previously
  said, Trump says: I don’t think you need a ceasefire. He says a ceasefire is
  “good to have” but he could understand why one country might not want one. We
  can work a peace deal while they’re fighting. They have to fight. I wish they
  could stop, I’d like them to stop, but strategically that could be a
  disadvantage for one side or the other. Here’s the clip. Trump also said
  earlier that he believes Vladimir Putin wants the war to end. Asked if he’s
  open to holding elections in his country, Zelenskyy says of course. He says it
  depends on safety and circumstances as they can’t hold elections during the
  war. Trump sounds intrigued by the prospect of not being able to hold
  elections if you’re at war … The reporter who last time attacked Zelenskyy
  over not dressing formally enough says the Ukrainian president looks
  “fabulous” in his suit, to which Trump says he said the same thing. The
  reporter apologises to Zelenskyy, who quips that while he changed his clothes
  the reporter is wearing the same suit he wore last time: “I changed, you did
  not.” Asked if Melania Trump sent the letter to Putin because he is the
  aggressor in this war, Trump dodges the question by talking about his wife’s
  love of children and her wanting to see the war end. He also claims the letter
  was “very well received” by Putin. Trump claims to have ended six wars and
  says he thought this would be the easiest one, but it’s a tough one. Asked if
  he understands the “root causes” of the war, Trump says the war has to end.
  Asked if future security guarantees for Ukraine could involve US troops, Trump
  doesn’t rule it out. “When it comes to security there’s going to be a lot of
  help … They’re the first line of defence because they’re there, Europe, but
  we’re going to help them out also, we’ll be involved.” Asked if he’s prepared
  to send US peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a peace deal, Trump says they’re
  going to work with Ukraine and Russia to ensure a peace that is long term.
  Asked if he’s prepared to agree to “redraw the maps” (i.e. cede territory to
  Russia), Zelenskyy highlights Russia’s continued attacks ahead of today’s
  talks and emphasises the need to stop the war, stop Russia, by way of
  diplomacy. In another nod to his first meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also
  declines to say who, Ukraine or Russia, “holds the cards”. Asked if today’s
  meeting is the end of the road for American support for Ukraine, Trump says:
  “I can never say that, it’s never the end of the road. People are being killed
  and we want to stop that.” Asked who is expected to end the war, Putin or
  Zelenskyy, Trump says “if everything works out today we’ll have a [trilateral
  meeting] … I think we’ll have a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do
  that”. Zelenskyy thanks Trump for his efforts to stop the killings and the
  war, he also thanks Melania Trump for her letter to Putin telling him “it is
  time” to protect children and future generations around the globe. They are
  speaking from the Oval Office now. Trump says he believes “very substantial
  progress” is being made in his talks with Putin, adding: “I think there’s a
  possibility that something could come out of it.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy has
  arrived at the White House for high-stakes talks with Donald Trump and
  European allies. He was greeted by the US president, both men stopped for
  pictures before moving swiftly inside. Zelesnkyy notably appeared to be
  wearing a suit, hopefully removing at least one previous point of contention.
  Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy should arrive any moment now to be
  greeted by Donald Trump, and to begin what could be the most important
  diplomatic meetings for him of the last three years. Here’s how the rest of
  the day is expected to play out (timings are US eastern time, and already a
  bit off as things are running late): 1.10pm - Oval Office press spray
  featuring Trump and Zelenskyy ahead of a bilateral meeting 2.30pm - photo with
  Trump and European leaders 3pm – Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders to all
  meet in the east room And as we are waiting for Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy
  to arrive shortly, let me pass the blog to Lucy Campbell to guide you through
  the main event. Setting his position publicly ahead of the meeting, Ukraine’s
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeated once again for call for allies to apply “joint
  pressure” on Russia to end the war and “stop the killings.” In a post on
  social media published shortly before going into the White House, he said:
  “Our main goal is a reliable and lasting peace for Ukraine and for the whole
  of Europe. And it is important that the momentum of all our meetings lead to
  precisely this result. We understand that we shouldn’t expect Putin to
  voluntarily abandon aggression and new attempts at conquest. That is why
  pressure must work, and it must be joint pressure – from the United States and
  Europe, and from everyone in the world who respects the right to life and the
  international order. We must stop the killings, and I thank our partners who
  are working toward this and ultimately toward a reliable and dignified peace.
  Together with the leaders of Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, the European
  Commission, and the Nato Secretary General, we coordinated our positions ahead
  of the meeting with President Trump. Ukraine is ready for a real truce and for
  establishing a new security architecture. We need peace.” European leaders are
  expected to start arriving at the White House soon. But, as per official
  schedule, US president Trump will meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  first in about an hour from now, with the Europeans only joining the talks
  later. We have a live stream showing their arrival here: We have just received
  the latest update from the Ukrainian authorities on the overnight Russian
  strikes on the country, with AFP reporting that the total number of killed has
  gone up to 14. The early-morning drone attack on Kharkiv reduced part of a
  five-storey residential building to rubble and sparked fires on at least three
  floors, governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram. “Seven civilians, including
  two children, have been killed in the attack,” Interior Minister Igor Klymenko
  said on social media, adding that 23 people were wounded. The city near the
  Russian border was also hit hours earlier by a ballistic missile that wounded
  at least 11 people, Mayor Igor Terekhov said. Klymenko said another three
  people were killed and 23 wounded in a strike on the Zaporizhzhia region. In
  the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, Russian shelling killed four people in
  settlements still under Ukrainian control – Dobropillia and Kostiantynivka,
  regional prosecutors said. One other thing to keep an eye on is what will
  Zelenskyy wear to the White House meeting. You will recall that he faced
  criticism for not wearing a suit during his last, explosive, visit to the
  White House in February. For what it’s worth, Zelenskyy wore a black t-shirt
  during his earlier meeting with Kellogg (15:20). Russian affairs reporter
  Russia’s Vladimir Putin also engaged in a burst of diplomacy on Monday,
  phoning the leaders of Brazil, India and South Africa to underscore that he is
  not isolated ahead of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s White House visit. The Kremlin
  said Putin briefed the three leaders in separate calls on the outcome of the
  Russia-US summit in Alaska. Ahead of Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump, Putin is
  seeking to rally support for his sweeping conditions to end the war in Ukraine
  from states that have either aligned with Moscow or chosen neutrality. Brazil,
  India, Russia, South Africa and China form the core of the BRICS economic
  bloc, which Moscow has relied on heavily since being shut out of western
  markets after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As part of the flurry of
  events tonight, we will also see a Fox News interview with Ukraine’s Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy at some point. To give you an idea of what’s ahead, in the last few
  minutes, Reuters reported, via Fox News, a comment attributed to Zelenskyy,
  saying it would be for him “impossible to give up territory” to Russia.
  European Council president António Costa has just said that there will be a
  further meeting with 27 EU countries to discuss today’s talks at the White
  House, taking place tomorrow. He said: “I have convened a video conference of
  the members of the European Council for tomorrow at 13.00 CEST, for a
  debriefing of today’s meetings in Washington DC about Ukraine. Together with
  the US, the EU will continue working towards a lasting peace that safeguards
  Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.” First European leaders are
  in Washington now, with UK prime minister Keir Starmer landing not long ago,
  and Nato secretary general Mark Rutte seen entering the Ukrainian embassy in
  Washington. US envoy Keith Kellogg later posted a picture from his meeting
  with Rutte, alongside US Nato ambassador Matt Whitaker. Sky News reported that
  the European Commission’s president Ursula von der Leyen and the Finnish
  president Alexander Stubb were in the building too, preparing for the White
  House visit. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, French president Emmanuel
  Macron, and German chancellor Friedrich Merz are also expected in Washington
  today. On the European side of the table, there will be one notable absence as
  Poland will not have a representative, despite being part of the previous
  rounds of consultations with Trump, including days before the Alaska summit
  last week. Since his election, the country’s new nationalist and Trump-backed
  president, Karol Nawrocki, has been at loggerheads with the pro-European
  coalition government led by former European Council president, Donald Tusk,
  including over who owns the relationship with the US. Poland’s constitution
  says somewhat vaguely that: The President of the Republic shall cooperate with
  the prime minister and the appropriate minister in respect of foreign policy.
  Ahead of last week’s Alaska summit, there had been some confusion as to who
  would take part in the preparatory calls because the two disagreed over their
  constitutional roles. Eventually Tusk joined the internal European call and
  the debrief with the “Coalition of the Willing”, but it was his staunch
  political rival, Nawrocki, who represented Poland at the main call with Trump.
  Ahead of today’s meeting, it was the foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, who
  represented Poland at the preparatory call in the “Coalition of the Willing”
  format over the weekend, further raising some eyebrows. Still, on Sunday,
  Nawrocki’s spokesperson appeared to be suggesting that the president was
  considering joining the European leaders’ trip to the US, and he promised a
  further update by the end of the day. But no official confirmation came
  through at all. The two camps eventually ended up pointing fingers at each
  other on Monday after it emerged that there would be no Polish representation
  after all. Speaking at a ceremony in Warsaw, Nawrocki said he was clear in his
  conversations with Trump about his mistrust of Vladimir Putin and Russia, but
  argued that it was the government’s role to participate in this particular
  format as Tusk has been attending previous summits of the coalition. He added
  that he was the only European leader with an upcoming bilateral meeting with
  Trump at the White House, too – on 3 September – and he would raise these
  issues then. But Poland’s foreign minister Sikorski was quick to pick up on
  this point, saying: “I inform you that it is the President of the United
  States who issues invitations to meetings at the White House, with whom Polish
  representatives of the Maga movement, as well as President @NawrockiKn
  personally, have privileged relations. I ask that they make use of these
  relations for the benefit of Poland and Europe.” His comments sparked a
  further reaction from Nawrocki’s foreign policy aide Marcin Przydacz, who said
  that as Sikorski was part of the pre-meeting call on Sunday, it was up to him
  to get Poland to join the meeting, with the president sticking to his original
  plans for next month’s visit instead. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  met with US envoy Keith Kellogg ahead of what he described as a “very serious”
  meeting with Trump and other European leaders later today. “When peace is
  discussed for one country in Europe, it means peace for all of Europe. We are
  ready to continue working with maximum effort to end the war and to ensure
  reliable security. These are the key issues. Last night, Russian attacks on
  our cities continued – among those killed were two children, and dozens of
  people were wounded. People were simply sleeping when the Russian army
  launched strikes on the cities. We discussed the battlefield situation and our
  strong diplomatic capabilities – Ukraine’s and all of Europe’s together with
  America. Russia can only be forced into peace through strength, and President
  Trump has that strength. We have to do everything right to make peace happen.
  Thank you!” In another post, Trump told his critics “I know exactly what I’m
  doing,” as he explained that he is there “to stop [the war], not to prosecute
  it any further.” He said: “I know exactly what I’m doing, and I don’t need the
  advice of people who have been working on all of these conflicts for years,
  and were never able to do a thing to stop them. They are “STUPID” people, with
  no common sense, intelligence, or understanding, and they only make the
  current R/U disaster more difficult to FIX.” He then insisted: Despite all of
  my lightweight and very jealous critics, I’ll get it done — I always do!!! US
  president Donald Trump has just posted on his Truth Social account ahead of
  today’s meeting with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and the group of European leaders.
  Here is what he said: “I am totally convinced that if Russia raised their
  hands and said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender, we will GIVE Ukraine
  and the great United States of America, the most revered, respected, and
  powerful of all countries, EVER, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and everything
  surrounding them for a thousand miles, the Fake News Media and their Democrat
  Partners would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J.
  Trump, one of the worst days in the history of our Country.” But that’s why
  they are the FAKE NEWS, and the badly failing Radical Left Democrats. Thank
  you for your attention to this matter!!!” Earlier, he said: “A big day at the
  White House. We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time. A
  great honor for America!!! Lets see what the results will be??? President DJT”
  British officials said the leaders planned to use that meeting to flesh out
  details of the Nato-style guarantees which were promised over the weekend by
  Steve Witkoff, the president’s Ukraine envoy. Those briefed on the meetings
  say however they do not expect a deal to be signed on Monday, describing the
  flurry of diplomatic activity as a “step towards” eventual peace. A Downing
  Street spokesperson said on Monday: “We welcome [the fact] that the US is
  prepared to give security guarantees. That is going to be an important aspect
  of the discussions, both today and in the period ahead. “For the coalition of
  the willing to be successful in deterring Putin – once we’ve got to a peace –
  from coming again, the United States’ involvement in providing that deterrence
  is actually critical.” The person added: “President Putin has never been
  serious about peace,” adding that the UK could still back further sanctions on
  Moscow despite Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, casting doubt that more
  sanctions would work. Starmer has been at the forefront of efforts to put
  together an alliance of countries who are willing to commit troops and other
  resources to defend Ukraine should Russia try to invade again, but has always
  said such a plan would require US support to work. British officials were
  delighted therefore when Witkoff told CNN over the weekend that the US and
  Europe could “effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security
  guarantee”, referring to Nato’s principle that an attack on one member is an
  attack on all. Starmer and his ministers have lavished praise on Trump since
  his meeting in Alaska with the Russian president, despite reports that the US
  president had backed a plan which would allow Russia to seize Ukrainian
  territory it does not currently occupy. Downing Street would not comment on
  territorial disputes on Monday, saying the subject was one for Zelenskyy to
  decide, but Starmer’s spokesperson did indicate the UK was no longer pushing
  for an immediate ceasefire while talks continue (14:09). We have just had the
  latest death toll update from the Ukrainian authorities, saying that Russian
  attacks overnight killed at least 10 people, just hours before presidents
  Zelenskyy and Trump meet in Washington, Reuters reported. An entire family
  including a toddler and her 16-year-old brother were among the seven killed in
  an overnight drone strike on a residential neighbourhood in northeastern
  Kharkiv, authorities said. Twenty-three people were wounded, they said. Three
  people were also killed in a ballistic missile strike on the southeastern city
  of Zaporizhzhia, the regional governor said, adding that another 23 were
  wounded. in Rome The Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, who has long
  demonstrated an affinity with the US president, Donald Trump, has arrived in
  Washington, according to the Italian news agency, Ansa. Before leaving Rome,
  Meloni’s office issued a statement referring to the video conference on Sunday
  with fellow European leaders, during which “the importance of continuing to
  work with the United States to end the conflict and achieve a peace that
  ensures the sovereignty and security of Ukraine” was reiterated, while
  confirming the need to “maintain collective pressure on Russia and ensure
  solid and credible security guarantees”. On the security guarantees for
  Ukraine, Meloni said on Saturday that Trump had highlighted an Italian
  proposal during his summit with Putin in Anchorage that was “inspired by
  Nato’s Article 5”. “The starting point of the proposal is the definition of a
  collective security clause that would allow Ukraine to benefit from the
  support of all its partners, including the USA, ready to take action in case
  it is attacked again,” Meloni added. Meloni also referred to the Trump-Putin
  meeting as having “finally” opened up “a glimmer of hope” on discussions of
  peace in Ukraine. Meloni last travelled to Washington in April for a bilateral
  with Trump. The pair met again in Rome just over a week later for the funeral
  of Pope Francis, before which Trump and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy held a brief but symbolic one-to-one talk in St Peter’s Basilica.
  Meloni was the only European leader to attend Trump’s inauguration as US
  president in January, and before that made a flying visit to his Mar-a-Lago
  golf club. In a separate social media clip, recorded on the plane en route to
  Washington, we get to hear directly from the UK prime minister. Starmer says:
  “This war in Ukraine has been going on a really long time now, three plus
  years. It’s hugely impacted the Ukrainians who have suffered hugely, but it’s
  also impacted Europe, it’s impacted every single family and community in the
  United Kingdom. And so everybody wants it to end, not least the Ukrainians.
  But we’ve got to get this right. We’ve got to make sure there is peace, that
  it is lasting peace, and that it is fair and that it is just. And that’s why
  I’m travelling to Washington with other European leaders to discuss this face
  to face with President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Because it’s in
  everyone’s interests, it’s in the UK’s interests that we get this right.” UK
  prime minister Keir Starmer’s spokesperson has been speaking to the media in
  the last half hour, suggesting that the UK would back a Ukraine peace deal
  without a ceasefire as a precondition, PA reported. “We’ve always said we want
  to see a sustainable and just peace for Ukraine. One that ensures peace
  returns to Europe and the Ukrainian people can live without fear of attack
  again, and an agreement that delivers that as soon as possible, but ends the
  killing and translates that into a lasting peace supported by security
  guarantees, would be a significantly positive step.” Pressed on whether that
  marked a change of position, Starmer’s spokesperson said: “We want to see an
  end to the killing. If you can bring about an end to the killing and bring
  about a sustained peace in one go, then all the better.” Ukraine’s borders are
  for the country to determine itself in negotiations, he added, stressing that
  “international borders must not be changed by force.” in Berlin Germany’s
  chancellor Friedrich Merz, who boarded a dawn flight to Washington on Monday,
  had found a silver lining for the Europeans out of the Alaska summit, saying
  on Saturday the United States was ready to be part of security guarantees for
  Ukraine under a peace deal. Trump’s pledge, however, was decidedly vague, as
  European leaders said at least some US boots would need to be on the ground in
  Ukraine for the guarantee to carry any weight as a deterrent against further
  Russian aggression. After Trump advisor Steve Witkoff suggested the security
  guarantees could be comparable to an Article 5 mutual defence protection
  within Nato, it begged the question whether the Europeans would commit troops
  of their own for Ukraine. At least in Germany, the response appeared muted at
  best. German vice-chancellor Lars Klingbeil told ZDF public television he
  wouldn’t rule anything out but stopped well-short of a full-throated pledge.
  “Now it’s about getting a ceasefire and then we can talk about everything
  else,” said Klingbeil, a Social Democrat. But for the foreign minister, Johann
  Wadephul of Merz’s Christian Democrats (CDU), the answer was a flat no, citing
  the growing presence of German soldiers in Lithuania - Berlin’s first
  permanent foreign troop deployment since the second world war. “To do that
  (station an armoured brigade in Lithuania) and on top of that station troops
  in Ukraine would probably overtax us,” Wadephul told podcast Table.Today.
  German officials attempted to sound bullish ahead of Monday’s meetings in
  Washington, underlining the united European front. “Speaking directly with
  Donald Trump in person will certainly have an impact,” CDU MP Norbert Röttgen,
  a leading voice on foreign policy, told the German edition of Politico. We see
  ourselves as Ukraine’s main supporter. European security is now a European
  matter – but we want to keep the Americans on board. Armin Laschet, head of
  parliament’s foreign affairs committee, saw the glass half full after the
  Alaska talks, noting that the lack of a deal also meant that no one-sided deal
  was agreed without Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Regarding any
  commitment of German troops as part of a security guarantee, Laschet told
  Berlin’s Inforadio he did not rule it out but remained guarded. “You can’t
  answer the question until you know the conditions. Is it in agreement with the
  United Nations? Is there a UN mandate? Did Russia agree to it?” Ukrainian
  president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered his response to overnight Russian
  strikes on Ukraine saying they were “demonstrative” of Russian intentions and
  showing its “cynical” position on war. He said: “And at this very moment, the
  Russians are attacking Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, the Sumy region, and Odesa,
  destroying residential buildings and our civilian infrastructure. Russians are
  deliberately killing people, particularly children. As of now, seven people
  have been killed as a result of the drone strike in Kharkiv, the youngest
  being a girl who is only a year and a half old, and dozens have been injured,
  including children. In Zaporizhzhia, missile strikes injured 20 people and
  killed three. My condolences go out to all of the victims’ families and loved
  ones. There was also a deliberate Russian strike on an energy facility in
  Odesa owned by an Azerbaijani company, implying that it was an attack not only
  on us but also on our relations and energy security.” He also pointed out the
  obvious context of the attacks: “They are aware that a meeting is taking place
  today in Washington that will address the end of the war. We will have a
  discussion with President Trump about key issues. Along with Ukraine, the
  leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the European
  Union, and Nato will participate in the conversation. Everyone seeks dignified
  peace and true security.” In a stark warning about Russia’s intentions,
  Zelenskyy also said that “the Russian war machine continues to destroy lives
  despite everything,” as “Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain
  pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts".”
  “That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the
  killings. That is why reliable security guarantees are required. That is why
  Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. The war must
  be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: ‘Stop.’” Meanwhile, the
  Ukrainian foreign minister clashed with his Hungarian counterpart on social
  media this morning after Hungary accused Ukraine of an attack on a Russian oil
  pipeline. Earlier this morning, Péter Szijjártó heavily criticised Ukraine for
  an attack on a Russian pipeline leading to Hungary, calling it “outrageous”
  and “unacceptable.” The Hungarian minister said: “Ukraine has once again
  attacked the oil pipeline leading to Hungary, cutting off supplies. This
  latest strike against our energy security is outrageous and unacceptable!
  Russian deputy energy minister Pavel Sorokin informed me that experts are
  working to restore the transformer station essential for operating the
  pipeline, but for now they cannot say when deliveries will resume. For 3.5
  years Brussels and Kyiv have tried to drag Hungary into the war in Ukraine.
  These repeated Ukrainian attacks on our energy supply serve that same purpose.
  Let me be clear: this is not our war. We have nothing to do with it, and as
  long as we are in charge, Hungary will stay out of it. Finally, a reminder to
  Ukrainian decision-makers: electricity from Hungary plays a vital role in
  powering your country …” His comments, including a thinly veiled threat
  against Ukraine, sparked an immediate reaction from Ukraine’s foreign
  minister, Andrii Sybiha, telling him to take his complaints to Moscow. “Peter,
  it is Russia, not Ukraine, who began this war and refuses to end it. Hungary
  has been told for years that Moscow is an unreliable partner. Despite this,
  Hungary has made every effort to maintain its reliance on Russia. Even after
  the full-scale war began. You can now send your complaints – and threats – to
  your friends in Moscow.” Separately, at least seven people were killed and
  some 20 injured in a separate attack on Ukraine’s second largest city,
  Kharkiv, agencies reported. Six children aged 6 to 17 were among 20 other
  people injured in the attack on Ukraine’s second largest city, Oleh Synehubov,
  governor of the wider Kharkiv region, wrote on Telegram. A ballistic missile
  attack shattered around 1,000 windows in various buildings in the city,
  Synehubov said. Some residents had to be evacuated from their homes, officials
  said. “Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it
  must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure,” Ukrainian foreign
  minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X after the attack. The number of people
  injured in the Russian shelling of Zaporizhzhia has increased to 17, according
  to the latest update from the Ukrainian army. Its statement added: The number
  of victims is being specified. The blast wave and debris damaged residential
  buildings and commercial premises, and a bus stop was partially destroyed. The
  necessary services are working at the scene. Meanwhile, showing growing
  concern about how the signals coming from the US are being understood by
  Russia, Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, posted a video of a Russian
  armoured vehicle carrying two flags, of Russia and the US. “Russian
  propagandists show a video in which Russian military equipment goes on the
  assault with the flags of Russia and the US.” He continued: “The Russians are
  using the symbols of the US in their own terrorist war of aggression, marked
  by the killing of civilians.” “Utter arrogance,” he added. In one of many
  posts on social media overnight, US president Donald Trump claimed that
  “president Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost
  immediately, if he wants to”. His comments are likely to alarm European
  leaders as they could signal growing US pressure on Ukraine to accept a deal,
  however imperfect or outright bad it is, as Trump is determined to secure a
  diplomatic success after his meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday. We all
  remember what happened during Zelenskyy’s last visit to the White House – even
  if US state secretary, Marco Rubio, appeared to play down apparent
  similarities between the two visit in his TV interview over the weekend. But,
  even more worringly for Europe, Trump also added: “Remember how it started. No
  getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!),
  and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!” This position
  by Trump appears to violate one of the European red lines for Ukraine, saying
  that Ukraine must not be blocked from deciding about its future. On Saturday,
  European leaders adopted a statement saying: “No limitations should be placed
  on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia
  cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato. It will be up to
  Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be
  changed by force.” It’s hard to reconcile the two positions – and there will
  be some concern that by meeting Zelenskyy first, without the Europeans, Trump
  could seek to pursue this line even further before he sees a concerted push
  back from European partners. One to watch. In the last few minutes, Finland’s
  prime minister Petteri Orpo said that a ceasefire and security guarantees for
  Ukraine are the most important topics at the meeting of US president Donald
  Trump, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. Finnish
  president, Alexander Stubb, will be among those in attendance. It’s Jakub
  Krupa here, taking over to guide you through the day as we build up to the
  main event in Washington this evening. Good morning. Asked behind the scenes
  at June’s G7 summit if he could explain why Donald Trump seemed to like him so
  much, Keir Starmer admitted he did not really know. But whatever the reason,
  when it comes to Ukraine, the UK prime minister is once again hoping to
  exploit this somewhat curious relationship, Peter Walker writes in this
  analysis. It continues: As soon as it was announced that a string of European
  leaders planned to join Volodymyr Zelenskyy to back the Ukrainian president in
  crucial talks with Trump at the White House on Monday, it was obvious Starmer
  would be joining them. The idea of Britain being some sort of bridge between
  US and European interests is something of a longstanding UK diplomatic cliche,
  and not one that always necessarily carries much meaning. But in the case of
  Ukraine, Starmer has very deliberately sought to position himself as a leader
  who can get along with Trump while consistently stressing to him Europe’s red
  lines over any peace plan, and trying to sweet-talk the president into
  offering US security guarantees. You can read the full analysis here: A
  Ukrainian drone intercepted by Russia near the Smolensk nuclear power plant
  detonated after falling but did not cause significant damage to the plant,
  Russia’s nuclear power corporation Rosatom said on Monday. “The damage is
  insignificant, there are no casualties,” Rosatom said. Russia’s Federal
  Security Service (FSB) said on Sunday it had prevented a Ukrainian drone
  attack on the Smolensk nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. A Russian drone
  attack on a five-storey apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv early
  Monday killed five people and wounded more than a dozen others, Ukrainian
  authorities said. The attack, which took place just before dawn, reduced part
  of the building to rubble and sparked fires on at least three floors, the
  region’s governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram. Russia fired four drones at
  the building, he said. Ukraine’s state emergency service posted videos showing
  rescuers attempting to break through the rubble to reach a trapped resident,
  while another showed a floor in flames, AFP reports. “Five people were killed,
  including a girl aged about one-and-a-half years old,” Ukraine’s prosecution
  service said. “At least 18 people were wounded and suffered acute shock,
  including children.” The city near the Russian border was also hit hours
  earlier by a ballistic missile that wounded at least 11 people, Mayor Igor
  Terekhov said. Russia also struck the southern Odesa region with drones early
  Monday, sparking a fire at a fuel facility, regional governor Oleg Kiper said.
  Ukraine’s air force said on Monday that Russia had launched four missiles and
  140 drones during an overnight attack on Ukraine, Reuters reports. The air
  force downed 88 drones and recorded hits in 25 locations across six Ukrainian
  regions, according to the statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. Here
  are some images coming to us over the wires. Ukraine’s foreign minister says
  Russia continues to kill civilians despite peace efforts ahead of the US and
  Ukrainian presidential summit. “Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine
  is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and
  pressure,” Andrii Sybiha wrote on X on Monday after a Russian attack on
  Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Sybiha also posted a photo of the
  smoking damage to a building, saying: This is a residential building in
  Kharkiv. This night Russia killed at least four people here, including a
  child, and injured many more … Moscow must stop the killing in order to
  advance diplomacy. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will make his second visit to the White
  House on Monday with the daunting task of reversing the damage done to
  Ukraine’s security prospects by Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. But as
  Julian Borger writes in this analysis, the Ukrainian president will not be
  alone as he was on his first trip to the White House in February, when he was
  ambushed and humiliated by Donald Trump and vice-president JD Vance, who
  sought to bully him into capitulation to Moscow’s demands. This time the
  Ukrainian leader comes to Washington flanked by a dream team of European
  leaders, including Britain’s Keir Starmer, Germany’s Friedrich Merz and
  France’s Emmanuel Macron, who combine economic and military clout with proven
  rapport with Trump. Their mission will be to use their individual and combined
  influence to coax the president out of the pro-Russian positions he adopted
  after just a couple of hours under Putin’s sway in the sub-Arctic on Friday.
  The full analysis is here: Germany’s foreign minister has called for
  stepped-up pressure on Russia, including more aid for Ukraine, to push Moscow
  into concessions toward a “just and lasting peace”. Johann Wadephul was
  speaking in Tokyo ahead of the summit between Donald Trump, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy and European leaders including German chancellor Friedrich Merz. “It
  is probably not an exaggeration to say the whole world is looking to
  Washington,” Reuters quotes Wadephul as saying at a press briefing on Monday
  alongside Japan’s foreign minister. “Firm security guarantees are central”
  because “Ukraine must be able to defend itself effectively even after a
  ceasefire and peace agreement”, he added. The White House has released the
  timings for the day’s events in Washington DC. Donald Trump is to hold a
  bilateral meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at 1.15pm
  (5.15pm GMT) on Monday at the White House. Trump will then participate in a
  multilateral meeting with European leaders visiting Washington at 3pm (7pm
  GMT). Here are some of the scenes in Washington DC amid the security operation
  for the crucial leaders’ summit. In saying “peace must be lasting”, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy also said on X that must be “not like it was years ago, when Ukraine
  was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East –part of Donbas – and Putin
  simply used it as a springboard for a new attack”. “Or when Ukraine was given
  so called ‘security guarantees’ in 1994, but they didn’t work,” the Ukrainian
  president said. Now, our soldiers have successes in Donetsk and Sumy regions.
  I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security,
  and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in
  America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable
  assistance. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy declared “Russia must end this war” as he arrived in Washington DC
  ahead of crucial talks with Donald Trump over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A
  host of European leaders will join Zelenskyy on Monday for the summit as they
  seek to provide a counterpoint to Vladimir Putin’s arguments following his
  talks with the US president on Friday. The leaders – British prime minister
  Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich
  Merz, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni and Finnish president Alexander Stubb –
  cleared their diaries to fly to the US at short notice, which is seen as a
  measure of how alarmed they were by Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Anchorage.
  After the Alaska talks Trump reportedly endorsed the Kremlin’s plan to end the
  war in Ukraine, including Kyiv giving up territory that Russia has been unable
  to seize and no ceasefire until a final deal has been agreed. Zelenskyy said
  in a post on X after arriving in Washington DC late on Sunday that he was
  grateful to Trump for the invitation and “we all share a strong desire to end
  this war quickly and reliably”. He also said that “peace must be lasting”.
  “Russia must end this war, which it itself started,” Zelenskyy said. “And I
  hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will
  force Russia into a real peace.” Here are some of the latest developments:
  Zelenskyy met European leaders in Brussels earlier on Sunday and reiterated
  Ukraine’s stance on land swaps, saying on X: “Ukraine’s constitution makes it
  impossible to give up or trade land. Since the territorial issue is so
  important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at
  the trilateral – Ukraine, the US, Russia. So far, Russia gives no sign this
  will happen, and if Russia refuses, new sanctions must follow.” Ahead of
  Monday’s peace talks in the US, Emmanuel Macron said that in order to have a
  “lasting peace deal for Ukraine, Ukraine needs a strong army”. He added that
  European allies want “Ukraine’s territorial integrity to be respected” and
  that “Ukraine must be represented in any talks on Ukraine’s future”. The
  French president also said that “our goal for tomorrow’s talks is to present a
  united front between Ukraine and its European allies”. The Washington talks
  will also be attended by the European Commission president, Ursula von der
  Leyen, and Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte. Zelenskyy has hailed the
  decision to offer security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal as he
  prepared to meet Trump. “Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work,
  must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air and
  at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation,” the Ukrainian
  president said. In announcing his visit to Washington, Keir Starmer praised
  Trump for his “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”. At the same
  time, the British PM reasserted Europe’s red lines, saying the “path to peace”
  could not be decided without Zelenskyy and that Russia should be “squeezed”
  with further sanctions. Starmer has deliberately sought to position himself as
  a leader who can get along with Trump while consistently stressing the red
  lines over any peace plan. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Russia
  and Ukraine were both “going to have to make concessions” for there to be a
  peaceful resolution to the war. In interviews on Sunday Rubio said the talks
  in Alaska had “made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas
  of agreement – but there remains some big areas of disagreement”. “We’re still
  a long ways off,” Rubio added. “We’re not at the precipice of a peace
  agreement. We’re not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made and
  towards one.” He declined to go into specific areas of agreement or
  disagreement. Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Putin had agreed that
  the US and European allies could offer Ukraine a Nato-style, “Article 5-like”
  security guarantee as part of an eventual deal to end the war. Witkoff added
  that Russia had agreed to unspecified concessions on five Ukrainian regions
  central to the war, particularly the eastern Donetsk province. “We agreed to
  robust security guarantees that I would describe as gamechanging,” he said.
  Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said
  early on Monday that Russia agreed that any future peace agreement must
  provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but added that Russia “has equal right to
  expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees”. European
  Union council president Antonio Costa said he “welcomed the United States’
  willingness to participate in providing security guarantees to Ukraine”. He
  also said: “Transatlantic unity is paramount at this moment to achieve a
  sustainable peace in Ukraine.”

This blog is closing now but please continue to follow our live coverage on our new blog here. Thank you for reading. In Australia, the conservative opposition appears likely to support any government decision to send Australian peacekeepers to Ukraine if the US-European talks lead to peace. When Labor prime minister Anthony Albanese previously said Australia would consider requests to join a peacekeeping force, then opposition leader Peter Dutton dismissed it as a “thought bubble”. But Dutton’s successor, Sussan Ley, has now indicated the opposition is open to Australia joining a global effort in Ukraine. A Ley spokesperson said: We will work constructively with the government in our national interest when it comes to our international relationships. The opposition unequivocally supported Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion, the spokesperson added. Australian Associated Press also reports that Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, said bipartisanship on his country’s security was vital. I welcome that decision, I think that’s a very smart decision. We’ve traditionally had that bipartisan support and I think it’s the right thing to do. British prime minister Keir Starmer has given some more comments, hailing “real progress” at the summit. Speaking after the event, Starmer described the talks as “good and constructive”, adding: “There was a real sense of unity between the European leaders that were there, and President Trump and President Zelensky.” The prime minister highlighted “two material outcomes” from the talks, firstly that the coalition of the willing “will now work with the US” on security guarantees. “That’s really important for security in Ukraine, for security in Europe, and for security in the UK,” Starmer said. “The other material outcome was the agreement that there will now be a bilateral agreement between President Putin and President Zelensky, that was after a phone call between President Trump and President Putin during the course of this afternoon, followed by a trilateral that will add in Trump. That is a recognition of the principle that on some of these issues, whether it’s territory or the exchange of prisoners, or the very serious issue of the return of children, that is something where Ukraine must be at the table. These were the two outcomes that were the most important coming out of today. They’re positive outcomes, there was a real sense of unity. We’ve made real progress today. On Monday Volodymyr Zelenskyy garnered compliments from both Donald Trump and the White House press pool for his formal jacket and trousers, after criticism of the clothes he chose to wear for his first visit the White House in February. Womenswear Daily has interviewed the Ukrainian man who designed the new suit. Viktor Anisimov told the magazine that Zelenskyy’s suit was not made in response to the previous meeting. “It’s not about the suit – it’s about what happens to Ukraine,” Anisimov told the magazine. During the talks Donald Trump and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen reportedly spoke about the issue of missing children. Later, Von der Leyen tweeted that “every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families”. Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, had raised the plight of children in Ukraine and Russia in a personal letter to Russian president Vladimir Putin, two White House officials said on Friday when Trump met Putin at a summit in Alaska. Trump hand-delivered that letter to Putin. As many as 35,000 Ukrainian children are still missing and thought to be held in Russia or Russian-occupied territories, according to an American team of experts, with families saying they are being forced to take desperate and risky measures to try to rescue them. Debris from destroyed Ukrainian drones sparked fires at an oil refinery and a hospital roof in Russia’s Volgograd region, the administration of the southwestern Russian region said on Tuesday in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “Firefighters are working on site trying to contain and extinguish the fires,” the administration cited the region’s governor, Andrei Bocharov, as saying in its post, which was reported by Reuters. “According to preliminary information, there are no injuries.” It’s 10.25pm in Washington DC and here’s a recap of the day’s key events so far: A Ukraine peace deal appeared far from imminent after Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders met Donald Trump at the White House and the US president ruled out a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, despite last week warning Moscow of “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin didn’t agree to halt the fighting. Trump said while sitting with the leaders on Monday: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe something like that could happen. As of this moment, it’s not happening.” Trump told Zelenskyy the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s security in any deal to end the war, though the extent of any assistance was not immediately clear. “I believe this is a major step forward,” Zelenskyy said, also saying security guarantees for Ukraine would probably be worked out within 10 days. Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy, according to Trump and European leaders, but Russia has not confirmed any meeting. Trump claimed on his Truth Social platform that arrangements were under way for a Zelenskyy-Putin meeting and, later, a trilateral meeting between the two along with Trump. The Russian president has previously resisted a one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s leader said it was ready to meet with Russia in “any format” and that territorial issues are “something we will leave between me and Putin”. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Putin told Trump in a call during the White House meeting that he was ready to meet Zelenskyy “within the next two weeks”. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Putin and Trump only discussed the “idea” of direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Monday’s phone call and that Putin told Trump he was open to the “idea” of direct talks with Ukraine. Trump described his meeting with Zelenskyy and the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato as “a very good, early step for a war that has been going on for almost four years”. He also wrote on social media that “everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine”. French president Emmanuel Macron called for stepping up sanctions against Russia if Vladimir Putin does not move forward on peace with Ukraine.German chancellor Friedrich Merz says Ukraine should not be forced to surrender its Donbas region to Russia in talks, likening it to the US giving up Florida. Finnish president Alexander Stubb said the main agreement from the White House meeting was that the killing had to end and that it remained to be seen if Putin had the courage to meet Zelenskyy. “Putin is rarely to be trusted,” Stubb said. Trump, however, seemed clearly swayed by Putin from their talks in Alaska last Friday and echoed the Russian president’s talking points, saying several times on Monday that ending the war was “up to” both Zelenskyy and Putin – rather than just Putin, the invader. Trump also said: “We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact – that means the war zone.” Ukraine will promise to buy $100bn of US weapons financed by Europe as part of a deal to get guarantees from the US for its security if there is a peace settlement with Russia, according to news reports. In stark contrast to the heated exchange during Zelenskyy’s first trip to Trump’s White House in February, the Ukrainian president’s charm offensive this time around looked to pay off, allowing him to emerge unscathed. Zelenskyy – who wore a black military-style suit and presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Melania Trump in response to her letter to Putin – said this meeting with Trump was his “best” so far. Here’s a fresh video of the proceedings in the White House as Donald Trump ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine while Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his European allies visited the US president. Trump said he had called Vladimir Putin and begun arrangements for a meeting between the Russian president and Ukrainian leader, also saying that “all of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire ... as of this moment it’s not happening”. However, the leaders of France and Germany refused to accept defeat on the issue, with German chancellor Friedrich Merz insisting “we would all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking place without one, and French president Emmanuel Macron also backing the idea of a truce as a “necessity”. Here’s the video wrap of the Washington meeting: Ukraine will promise to buy $100bn of US weapons financed by Europe as part of a deal to get guarantees from the US for its security if there is a peace settlement with Russia, according to reports. Warren Murray writes in our Ukraine war briefing that the Financial Times cited a document seen by its reporter, while the Washington Post said it had also confirmed the proposal. The FT added that Ukraine and the US would also strike a $50bn deal to produce drones with Ukrainian companies. The drone news may be repeat of recent similar announcements. You can read the full Ukraine briefing here: Returning now to the Finnish president’s comments after the White House meeting, Alexander Stubb said his Russian counterpart was not trustworthy. “Putin is rarely to be trusted,” Stubb told Finnish reporters, cited by Reuters. “So now it remains to be seen whether he has the courage to come to this type of meeting. Does he have the courage to come to a trilateral meeting, or is he once again playing for time? French president Emmanuel Macron has called for stepping up sanctions against Russia if Vladimir Putin does not move forward on peace with Ukraine. “President Trump believes we can get an agreement and believes that President Putin also wants a peace accord,” Macron told reporters after the talks at the White House. “But if at the end this process is met by refusal, we are also ready to say that we need to increase sanctions.” Macron pointed to recent secondary sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on India, a major buyer of Russian energy as western nations cut back due to sanctions over Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Macron said the secondary sanctions on India had “had a lot of effects”, Agence France-Presse reports. Over the weekend, Trump publicly again pressured Ukraine to concede territory, siding with Putin and not Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has insisted on defending all territory that Russia has taken by force. Asked by reporters if Trump had said that concessions were necessary before any US security guarantees to Ukraine, Macron said: “No, that wasn’t discussed at all. We’re well away from that.” He said he hoped Russia and Ukraine would resume contact “in the coming days” with a potential three-way summit involving Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy “in two to three weeks”. As Donald Trump touted his bona fides as the so-called “peacemaker-in-chief” during talks over Ukraine at the White House, he made two big claims: that he wants peace deals instead of ceasefires, and that he has ended six wars since he became president. But as Andrew Roth explains, in Trump’s haste to hammer out a peace deal in Ukraine, he is playing fast and loose with the truth. Trump and his administration have claimed to have helped settle the conflicts between Israel and Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand, India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia … On the subject of ceasefires, by Trump’s own admission, he has often been seeking them in these conflicts. Now, he has sought to rewrite the record, piling pressure on Ukraine. Trump’s declaration that he was not seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine came after last week’s meeting Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where the Russian president initially demanded that Ukraine cede control over territory in the country’s southeast before negotiating a ceasefire. The question is crucial to the sequencing of an eventual peace in Ukraine. You can read Roth’s full explainer here: French president Emmanuel Macron says any future peace deal between Russia and Ukraine cannot restrict the size of Kyiv’s military. Macron told reporters that Donald Trump and European leaders had agreed on the need for a “robust Ukrainian army that can resist any attempted attack” and that it would not have “any limitation in number or capacity of arms”. Macron also said on Monday the White House talks did not discuss Ukrainian territorial concessions, AFP is reporting. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is saying security guarantees for Kyiv will likely be worked out within the next 10 days. “Security guarantees will probably be ‘unpacked’ by our partners, and more and more details will emerge,” the Ukrainian president said at a broadcast press briefing after his meetings in Washington DC. “All of this will somehow be formalised on paper within the next week to 10 days,” he said on Tuesday, quoted by Reuters. Zelenskyy also said territorial issues related to a potential peace agreement would be worked out between Ukraine and Russia. German chancellor Friedrich Merz says Ukraine should not be forced to surrender its Donbas region to Russia in talks, likening it to the US giving up a state. “The Russian demand that Kyiv give up the free parts of Donbas corresponds, to put it bluntly, to a proposal for the United States to have to give up Florida,” Merz told reporters after the White House talks on Monday. Merz said Putin and Trump – in their call in the midst of the talks – “agreed that there would be a meeting between the Russian president and the Ukrainian president within the next two weeks”. Merz, quoted by Agence France-Presse, also said Trump voiced a readiness to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, even though the US president put the onus on Europeans. The German chancellor said: The bottom line is that the United States of America is prepared to provide security guarantees and to coordinate this with the Europeans. There will be appropriate security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement. Trump has repeatedly ruled out Ukraine entering Nato, siding with Putin who has called the step a provocation. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov has said Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump only discussed the “idea” of direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Monday’s phone call. Russia’s Tass news agency quoted the aide as saying Putin told Trump that he was open to the “idea” of direct talks with Ukraine. Tass, cited by Agence France-Presse, quoted Ushakov as saying: In the course of the further phone conversation, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump expressed support for the continuation of direct negotiations between the delegations of Russia and Ukraine. In this regard, in particular, the idea was discussed that it would be necessary to study the possibility of raising the level of representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian sides, that is, those representatives who participate in the aforementioned direct negotiations. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is ready for a bilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, Agence France-Presse is reporting. Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump he was ready to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy within a fortnight, German chancellor Friedrich Merz has told reporters. Merz said that Putin and Trump – in their phone call in the midst of the White House talks – “agreed that there would be a meeting between the Russian president and the Ukrainian president within the next two weeks”, Agence France-Presse reports. Finland’s president has said the main agreement from the White House meeting was that the killing has to end. Alexander Stubb said Donald Trump felt like it was a good idea to call Vladimir Putin and propose a bilateral meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin, adding that it remained to be seen if Putin had the courage to come to such a meeting, Reuters is reporting Putin could not be trusted, Stubb also said. It was reported earlier that Trump interrupted his White House talks with European leaders to make the call to the Russian president. Donald Trump also said in his Truth Social post that during today’s Washington talks he and European leaders discussed security guarantees for Ukraine and “which Guarantees would be provided by the various European Countries, with a coordination with the United States of America”. Earlier in the day, when asked if future security guarantees for Ukraine could involve American troops, the US president didn’t rule it out. Trump said: When it comes to security there’s going to be a lot of help … They’re the first line of defence because they’re there, Europe, but we’re going to help them out also, we’ll be involved. Six European leaders joined Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the Washington meeting with Donald Trump – here’s what the scenes looked like. Donald Trump has taken to social media to say arrangements are under way for a future meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin and, later, a trilateral meeting between the two along with Trump. The US president posted on his Truth Social platform that today’s meeting in Washington was “a very good, early step for a War that has been going on for almost four years”. He said vice-president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were “coordinating with Russia and Ukraine”. Trump said: Everyone is very happy about the possibility of PEACE for Russia/Ukraine. At the conclusion of the meetings, I called President Putin, and began the arrangements for a meeting, at a location to be determined, between President Putin and President Zelenskyy. After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself. Putin has previously resisted a one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy. That’s all from me Lucy Campbell for today. My colleague Adam Fulton will be along shortly to steer you through the rest of the day’s news. The reporter who criticised Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not dressing formally enough during his last meeting with Donald Trump said the Ukrainian president looked ‘fabulous’ in his suit during their latest meeting at the White House – and our video colleagues have clipped the exchange here: Ukraine’s Air Force said early on Tuesday (local time) that two Russian strategic bombers took off from Russian airfields for a possible attack on Ukraine. “We will provide additional updates if the situation changes,” the Air Force said on the Telegram messaging app. A spokesperson for Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told NBC News: “The meeting has ended, but European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are staying for now in DC to continue talks, potentially in another format.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen posted an image of the leaders alongside Donald Trump inside the White House with a message of unity and stressing the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine. We now have confirmation from the White House that Donald Trump’s talks with European leaders in the east room has concluded. Reuters and AFP are also reporting that Donald Trump paused his meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the other European leaders to call Vladimir Putin. Reuters cites an EU diplomat, while AFP cites an unnamed source close to the talks. At the time of writing, Donald Trump has ruled out a ceasefire in Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his European allies visited the White House to push for US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term peace deal. The US president, who only last week warned Russia of “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin failed to agree to a halt the fighting, made clear today that he had reversed his position. Later, sitting with the other European leaders in the east room, he acknowledged: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe something like that could happen. As of this moment, it’s not happening.” But some of the European allies refused to accept defeat on the ceasefire issue, mindful that the lack of one allows Putin more time to wage his war of aggression. Friedrich Merz, the chancellor of Germany, insisted that “we would all like to see a ceasefire” and he could not imagine the next meeting taking place without one. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, also backed the idea of a “truce” as a “necessity”, adding: “We all support this idea.” By way of strategy, the leaders led with praise and gratitude for Trump, and several notably mirrored his language (for example, saying they wanted to “stop the killing”) and stressing the importance of protecting Ukraine’s children, referencing his wife Melania’s letter sent over the weekend to Putin urging him to consider children impacted by the war. Trump, though, was clearly swayed by Putin in Alaska and echoing his talking points. He said several times today that ending the war was “up to” both Zelenskyy and Putin (as opposed to just Putin, the invader). Ominously for Ukraine, Trump also added: “We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact – that means the war zone.” But he said Putin had accepted there would be security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a peace deal and that the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s safety, which Kyiv has long said would be essential for a lasting peace. “When it comes to security, there’s going to be a lot of help,” Trump said. He declined to rule out sending US troops to Ukraine, noting it would be a discussion point with European leaders. But he also made it clear that European countries would be expected to mostly carry the burden, saying: “They are a first line of defence because they’re there. But we’ll help them out.” Several of the leaders emphasised the importance of the security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again. Macron said: “The first one is clearly a credible Ukrainian army for the years and decades to come.” Europe was also clear about carrying its “fair share” of the burden, he said, “so you can count on this as we can continue”. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian PM, said: ‘We will talk about many important topics. The first one is security guarantees, how to be sure that it won’t happen again, which is the precondition of every kind of peace.” Trump also expressed hope that the talks with Zelenskyy could lead to a trilateral meeting with Putin. “I think if everything works out well today we’ll have a [trilateral meeting], and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.” And in stark contrast to the infamously heated exchange during Zelenskyy’s first trip to Trump’s White House in February, the Ukrainian president’s charm offensive this time around – which included wearing a black military-style suit and presenting a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Melania Trump in response to her letter to Putin – seemed to pay off, allowing him to emerge unscathed. But the state of play for Ukraine coming out of today’s meetings remains to be seen, and we’ll bring you more as soon as we get it. Sources in the Ukrainian delegation at the White House have told the BBC that talks involving Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders have ended. We’ll bring you more as we get it. Donald Trump has interrupted his talks in Washington with European leaders to call Vladimir Putin, German newspaper Bild is reporting. Bild said the meetings are due to resume after the call, which Trump had initially said would take place afterwards. If there was a sign that Volodymyr Zelenskyy wasn’t going to be immediately voted off the island of the Donald Trump diplomacy show, it came early on when a familiar voice commended his choice of attire. “President Zelensky, you look fabulous in that suit,” said Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump pundit and member of the White House press corps, who had attacked him for wearing military fatigues during the infamous Oval Office meeting in February. “I said the same thing,” Trump added. “You are in the same suit,” Zelenskyy shot back, earning smiles and laughter from the room including the US president. “I changed, you did not.” Thus did Zelenskyy survive his first media appearance at the White House with Trump on Monday as the US president focused less on belittling the leader of a wartime ally than boasting – and in many cases exaggerating – his exploits as a peacemaker in world conflicts. Zelenskyy, dressed reluctantly in a black military-style suit to appease sticklers for protocol in the White House, largely sat by quietly as Trump claimed to have hammered out peace deals in six wars including one the veteran real estate developer said had taken place in the “Republic of the Condo”. From Trump there was hyperbole about his ability to broker peace deals, digressions to internal US political battles over mail-in ballots, nebulous declarations about how he would end the conflict and evasions over how he would do that without negotiating a ceasefire. But there were no explosions – which meant for Zelenskyy it probably went as well as it could have. He found a far more hospitable welcome from both Trump and JD Vance, and he kicked off the meeting with some high-level flattery, thanking Trump profusely for his efforts to end the conflict and praising Melania Trump for sending a letter to Putin about abducted Ukrainian children. There was little detail about the peace deal that Trump wanted to hammer out, except for the fact that he wanted to skip past a ceasefire – too difficult to actually negotiate – and go straight for a peace deal. And yet it appeared that all – or at least most – sides were keen to smooth over their differences in order to prevent Ukraine as being seen as the main obstruction to peace and of throwing the ball back to Putin. What has Vladimir Putin been up to today during the great international assembly at the White House? It appears to have been a drab day in Moscow all around, damp and grey and the Russian president hosting a meeting at the Kremlin with the acting governor of the Rostov region, Yury Slyusar. One gripping regional media headline is: “Putin noted a decrease in the pace of agricultural production in the Rostov region.” Meanwhile the attacks and the killing in Ukraine go on. That’s the end of the public remarks from the meeting between Trump and the European leaders. As they continue talks through the afternoon, we’ll bring you more as we get it. The UK’s prime minister Keir Starmer echoes Macron’s sentiments that “we all want peace” and guaranteeing Ukraine’s security guarantees the security of Europe as a whole. He adds that a trilateral meeting is “the sensible next step”. Security guarantees and a trilateral meeting with Russia, Ukraine and the US would be a “historic” step forward, he says. French president Emmanuel Macron, notably, opens his remarks by saying: “Everybody around this table is in favour of peace”. Discussions of security guarantees are “about the whole security of the European continent”, he tells Trump. He reiterates Merz’s comments about asking for a ceasefire “at least to stop the kiilling”, adding “we all support this idea”. Security guarantees would involve a strong Ukrainian army for “years and decades to come”, and a commitment from all those around the table to build security, he says. German chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasises that they would like to see a ceasefire. “To be honest, we all would like to see a ceasefire, the latest from the next meeting on,” he tells Trump. He adds that he “can’t imagine” the trilateral meeting will take place without one, urging the US president to put pressure on Russia to get one. Trump says “we’ll see … if we can do that” but, as he did earlier, highlights the “six wars|” he claims to have ended without a ceasefire. Invited to address the media, Zelenksyy says he and Trump had a “constructive” meeting, a “very good conversation”. He reiterates that Ukraine’s security depends on the European countries present and the United States. “This is very important the the US gives such strong signal and is ready for security guarantees,” he says. Trump says he would prefer an immediate to ceasefire in Ukraine while they work on a peace deal, but “as of this moment, it’s not happening”. Trump reiterates that he wants a trilateral meeting soon. Trump says after his summit with Putin he believes that peace is “within reach”. In a “significant step”, Putin agreed Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine, he says. He says the leaders at this meeting will be considering “who will do what, essentially” regarding Ukraine’s future security. Trump says he’s optimistic that the group can reach an agreement that will deter future aggression against Ukraine, adding: I actually think there won’t be. I even think that’s largely overrated. “I think the European nations are going to take a lot of the burden,” he says, reiterating that the US will be involved. “We’re going to help them.” The meeting will also discuss the “possible exchanges of territory”, he adds, ominously for Ukraine. There is a feed at the top of the blog if you’d like to follow the meeting live. That multilateral meeting has just started between Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the European leaders at the White House. Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have just posed for a “family photo” with European leaders. Here it is, featuring UK prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish president Alexander Stubb, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Well, the optics of this initial meeting were far friendlier than the last time these people were all in the Oval Office together, and Zelenskyy and the other European leaders will no doubt be very pleased with how suit-gate was handled, for example – heck, there was even laughing at times. But despite this lightheartedness, there were some worrying developments for Kyiv. Perhaps most key was Trump’s assertion that he’s decided he doesn’t need a ceasefire after all in order to negotiate a peace deal, after spending months demanding one from Russia and threatening sanctions and “severe consequences” if it didn’t comply. Things have clearly changed after his Alaska summit with Putin, who knows the US president wants peace more than anything and has played this up to his advantage by blaming others for being obstacles to ending the war. But there were glimmers of hope for Kyiv, notably Trump saying the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s security in a peace deal, giving Ukraine “very good protection”. Kyiv has long said this would essential for achieving a lasting peace. But Trump remained uncommitted on what level of specific security guarantees the US is willing to support, for instance whether its involvement would include an Article 5-style defence commitment and/or American boots on the ground, and also made clear that most of the burden would fall on Europe. Whether Trump can now be convinced once again by Zelenskyy and the Europeans that the onus is on Russia to end its war, and not on Ukraine to give up territory, in order to achieve peace remains to be seen. Earlier Trump was asked if he would offer Ukraine [Nato] Article 5-style security guarantees. He said this hasn’t been discussed yet but says of Kyiv: We will give them very good protection, very good security. That’s part of it. Trump says he just spoke to Putin indirectly, and will speak to him again after these meetings today “and we may or may not have a [trilateral meeting].” “He’s expecting my call when we’re finished with this meeting,” Trump says. Asked what security guarantees he needs from Trump, Zelenskyy says: “Everything.” He says he needs a strong Ukrainian army – weapons, training, equipment, intelligence. He says he will discuss this with “our partners”, the “big countries including the United States”. Going even more off topic, Trump claims mail-in ballots are “corrupt” and he wants to end them. (Putin apparently brought this up in Alaska on Friday, much to Trump’s delight). Trump goes on a tirade about Joe Biden, adding to an earlier detour where he appeared to justify his federal takeover of Washington DC by highlighting that people felt safe enough to go out to dinner again in the nation’s capital. Asked if there will still be “severe consequences” for Russia if a ceasefire isn’t agreed, as he previously said, Trump says: I don’t think you need a ceasefire. He says a ceasefire is “good to have” but he could understand why one country might not want one. We can work a peace deal while they’re fighting. They have to fight. I wish they could stop, I’d like them to stop, but strategically that could be a disadvantage for one side or the other. Here’s the clip. Trump also said earlier that he believes Vladimir Putin wants the war to end. Asked if he’s open to holding elections in his country, Zelenskyy says of course. He says it depends on safety and circumstances as they can’t hold elections during the war. Trump sounds intrigued by the prospect of not being able to hold elections if you’re at war … The reporter who last time attacked Zelenskyy over not dressing formally enough says the Ukrainian president looks “fabulous” in his suit, to which Trump says he said the same thing. The reporter apologises to Zelenskyy, who quips that while he changed his clothes the reporter is wearing the same suit he wore last time: “I changed, you did not.” Asked if Melania Trump sent the letter to Putin because he is the aggressor in this war, Trump dodges the question by talking about his wife’s love of children and her wanting to see the war end. He also claims the letter was “very well received” by Putin. Trump claims to have ended six wars and says he thought this would be the easiest one, but it’s a tough one. Asked if he understands the “root causes” of the war, Trump says the war has to end. Asked if future security guarantees for Ukraine could involve US troops, Trump doesn’t rule it out. “When it comes to security there’s going to be a lot of help … They’re the first line of defence because they’re there, Europe, but we’re going to help them out also, we’ll be involved.” Asked if he’s prepared to send US peacekeepers to Ukraine as part of a peace deal, Trump says they’re going to work with Ukraine and Russia to ensure a peace that is long term. Asked if he’s prepared to agree to “redraw the maps” (i.e. cede territory to Russia), Zelenskyy highlights Russia’s continued attacks ahead of today’s talks and emphasises the need to stop the war, stop Russia, by way of diplomacy. In another nod to his first meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also declines to say who, Ukraine or Russia, “holds the cards”. Asked if today’s meeting is the end of the road for American support for Ukraine, Trump says: “I can never say that, it’s never the end of the road. People are being killed and we want to stop that.” Asked who is expected to end the war, Putin or Zelenskyy, Trump says “if everything works out today we’ll have a [trilateral meeting] … I think we’ll have a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that”. Zelenskyy thanks Trump for his efforts to stop the killings and the war, he also thanks Melania Trump for her letter to Putin telling him “it is time” to protect children and future generations around the globe. They are speaking from the Oval Office now. Trump says he believes “very substantial progress” is being made in his talks with Putin, adding: “I think there’s a possibility that something could come out of it.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived at the White House for high-stakes talks with Donald Trump and European allies. He was greeted by the US president, both men stopped for pictures before moving swiftly inside. Zelesnkyy notably appeared to be wearing a suit, hopefully removing at least one previous point of contention. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy should arrive any moment now to be greeted by Donald Trump, and to begin what could be the most important diplomatic meetings for him of the last three years. Here’s how the rest of the day is expected to play out (timings are US eastern time, and already a bit off as things are running late): 1.10pm - Oval Office press spray featuring Trump and Zelenskyy ahead of a bilateral meeting 2.30pm - photo with Trump and European leaders 3pm – Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders to all meet in the east room And as we are waiting for Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy to arrive shortly, let me pass the blog to Lucy Campbell to guide you through the main event. Setting his position publicly ahead of the meeting, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeated once again for call for allies to apply “joint pressure” on Russia to end the war and “stop the killings.” In a post on social media published shortly before going into the White House, he said: “Our main goal is a reliable and lasting peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe. And it is important that the momentum of all our meetings lead to precisely this result. We understand that we shouldn’t expect Putin to voluntarily abandon aggression and new attempts at conquest. That is why pressure must work, and it must be joint pressure – from the United States and Europe, and from everyone in the world who respects the right to life and the international order. We must stop the killings, and I thank our partners who are working toward this and ultimately toward a reliable and dignified peace. Together with the leaders of Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, the European Commission, and the Nato Secretary General, we coordinated our positions ahead of the meeting with President Trump. Ukraine is ready for a real truce and for establishing a new security architecture. We need peace.” European leaders are expected to start arriving at the White House soon. But, as per official schedule, US president Trump will meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy first in about an hour from now, with the Europeans only joining the talks later. We have a live stream showing their arrival here: We have just received the latest update from the Ukrainian authorities on the overnight Russian strikes on the country, with AFP reporting that the total number of killed has gone up to 14. The early-morning drone attack on Kharkiv reduced part of a five-storey residential building to rubble and sparked fires on at least three floors, governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram. “Seven civilians, including two children, have been killed in the attack,” Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said on social media, adding that 23 people were wounded. The city near the Russian border was also hit hours earlier by a ballistic missile that wounded at least 11 people, Mayor Igor Terekhov said. Klymenko said another three people were killed and 23 wounded in a strike on the Zaporizhzhia region. In the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, Russian shelling killed four people in settlements still under Ukrainian control – Dobropillia and Kostiantynivka, regional prosecutors said. One other thing to keep an eye on is what will Zelenskyy wear to the White House meeting. You will recall that he faced criticism for not wearing a suit during his last, explosive, visit to the White House in February. For what it’s worth, Zelenskyy wore a black t-shirt during his earlier meeting with Kellogg (15:20). Russian affairs reporter Russia’s Vladimir Putin also engaged in a burst of diplomacy on Monday, phoning the leaders of Brazil, India and South Africa to underscore that he is not isolated ahead of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s White House visit. The Kremlin said Putin briefed the three leaders in separate calls on the outcome of the Russia-US summit in Alaska. Ahead of Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump, Putin is seeking to rally support for his sweeping conditions to end the war in Ukraine from states that have either aligned with Moscow or chosen neutrality. Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa and China form the core of the BRICS economic bloc, which Moscow has relied on heavily since being shut out of western markets after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As part of the flurry of events tonight, we will also see a Fox News interview with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy at some point. To give you an idea of what’s ahead, in the last few minutes, Reuters reported, via Fox News, a comment attributed to Zelenskyy, saying it would be for him “impossible to give up territory” to Russia. European Council president António Costa has just said that there will be a further meeting with 27 EU countries to discuss today’s talks at the White House, taking place tomorrow. He said: “I have convened a video conference of the members of the European Council for tomorrow at 13.00 CEST, for a debriefing of today’s meetings in Washington DC about Ukraine. Together with the US, the EU will continue working towards a lasting peace that safeguards Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.” First European leaders are in Washington now, with UK prime minister Keir Starmer landing not long ago, and Nato secretary general Mark Rutte seen entering the Ukrainian embassy in Washington. US envoy Keith Kellogg later posted a picture from his meeting with Rutte, alongside US Nato ambassador Matt Whitaker. Sky News reported that the European Commission’s president Ursula von der Leyen and the Finnish president Alexander Stubb were in the building too, preparing for the White House visit. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, French president Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor Friedrich Merz are also expected in Washington today. On the European side of the table, there will be one notable absence as Poland will not have a representative, despite being part of the previous rounds of consultations with Trump, including days before the Alaska summit last week. Since his election, the country’s new nationalist and Trump-backed president, Karol Nawrocki, has been at loggerheads with the pro-European coalition government led by former European Council president, Donald Tusk, including over who owns the relationship with the US. Poland’s constitution says somewhat vaguely that: The President of the Republic shall cooperate with the prime minister and the appropriate minister in respect of foreign policy. Ahead of last week’s Alaska summit, there had been some confusion as to who would take part in the preparatory calls because the two disagreed over their constitutional roles. Eventually Tusk joined the internal European call and the debrief with the “Coalition of the Willing”, but it was his staunch political rival, Nawrocki, who represented Poland at the main call with Trump. Ahead of today’s meeting, it was the foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, who represented Poland at the preparatory call in the “Coalition of the Willing” format over the weekend, further raising some eyebrows. Still, on Sunday, Nawrocki’s spokesperson appeared to be suggesting that the president was considering joining the European leaders’ trip to the US, and he promised a further update by the end of the day. But no official confirmation came through at all. The two camps eventually ended up pointing fingers at each other on Monday after it emerged that there would be no Polish representation after all. Speaking at a ceremony in Warsaw, Nawrocki said he was clear in his conversations with Trump about his mistrust of Vladimir Putin and Russia, but argued that it was the government’s role to participate in this particular format as Tusk has been attending previous summits of the coalition. He added that he was the only European leader with an upcoming bilateral meeting with Trump at the White House, too – on 3 September – and he would raise these issues then. But Poland’s foreign minister Sikorski was quick to pick up on this point, saying: “I inform you that it is the President of the United States who issues invitations to meetings at the White House, with whom Polish representatives of the Maga movement, as well as President @NawrockiKn personally, have privileged relations. I ask that they make use of these relations for the benefit of Poland and Europe.” His comments sparked a further reaction from Nawrocki’s foreign policy aide Marcin Przydacz, who said that as Sikorski was part of the pre-meeting call on Sunday, it was up to him to get Poland to join the meeting, with the president sticking to his original plans for next month’s visit instead. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with US envoy Keith Kellogg ahead of what he described as a “very serious” meeting with Trump and other European leaders later today. “When peace is discussed for one country in Europe, it means peace for all of Europe. We are ready to continue working with maximum effort to end the war and to ensure reliable security. These are the key issues. Last night, Russian attacks on our cities continued – among those killed were two children, and dozens of people were wounded. People were simply sleeping when the Russian army launched strikes on the cities. We discussed the battlefield situation and our strong diplomatic capabilities – Ukraine’s and all of Europe’s together with America. Russia can only be forced into peace through strength, and President Trump has that strength. We have to do everything right to make peace happen. Thank you!” In another post, Trump told his critics “I know exactly what I’m doing,” as he explained that he is there “to stop [the war], not to prosecute it any further.” He said: “I know exactly what I’m doing, and I don’t need the advice of people who have been working on all of these conflicts for years, and were never able to do a thing to stop them. They are “STUPID” people, with no common sense, intelligence, or understanding, and they only make the current R/U disaster more difficult to FIX.” He then insisted: Despite all of my lightweight and very jealous critics, I’ll get it done — I always do!!! US president Donald Trump has just posted on his Truth Social account ahead of today’s meeting with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and the group of European leaders. Here is what he said: “I am totally convinced that if Russia raised their hands and said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender, we will GIVE Ukraine and the great United States of America, the most revered, respected, and powerful of all countries, EVER, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and everything surrounding them for a thousand miles, the Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump, one of the worst days in the history of our Country.” But that’s why they are the FAKE NEWS, and the badly failing Radical Left Democrats. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!” Earlier, he said: “A big day at the White House. We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time. A great honor for America!!! Lets see what the results will be??? President DJT” British officials said the leaders planned to use that meeting to flesh out details of the Nato-style guarantees which were promised over the weekend by Steve Witkoff, the president’s Ukraine envoy. Those briefed on the meetings say however they do not expect a deal to be signed on Monday, describing the flurry of diplomatic activity as a “step towards” eventual peace. A Downing Street spokesperson said on Monday: “We welcome [the fact] that the US is prepared to give security guarantees. That is going to be an important aspect of the discussions, both today and in the period ahead. “For the coalition of the willing to be successful in deterring Putin – once we’ve got to a peace – from coming again, the United States’ involvement in providing that deterrence is actually critical.” The person added: “President Putin has never been serious about peace,” adding that the UK could still back further sanctions on Moscow despite Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, casting doubt that more sanctions would work. Starmer has been at the forefront of efforts to put together an alliance of countries who are willing to commit troops and other resources to defend Ukraine should Russia try to invade again, but has always said such a plan would require US support to work. British officials were delighted therefore when Witkoff told CNN over the weekend that the US and Europe could “effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security guarantee”, referring to Nato’s principle that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Starmer and his ministers have lavished praise on Trump since his meeting in Alaska with the Russian president, despite reports that the US president had backed a plan which would allow Russia to seize Ukrainian territory it does not currently occupy. Downing Street would not comment on territorial disputes on Monday, saying the subject was one for Zelenskyy to decide, but Starmer’s spokesperson did indicate the UK was no longer pushing for an immediate ceasefire while talks continue (14:09). We have just had the latest death toll update from the Ukrainian authorities, saying that Russian attacks overnight killed at least 10 people, just hours before presidents Zelenskyy and Trump meet in Washington, Reuters reported. An entire family including a toddler and her 16-year-old brother were among the seven killed in an overnight drone strike on a residential neighbourhood in northeastern Kharkiv, authorities said. Twenty-three people were wounded, they said. Three people were also killed in a ballistic missile strike on the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional governor said, adding that another 23 were wounded. in Rome The Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, who has long demonstrated an affinity with the US president, Donald Trump, has arrived in Washington, according to the Italian news agency, Ansa. Before leaving Rome, Meloni’s office issued a statement referring to the video conference on Sunday with fellow European leaders, during which “the importance of continuing to work with the United States to end the conflict and achieve a peace that ensures the sovereignty and security of Ukraine” was reiterated, while confirming the need to “maintain collective pressure on Russia and ensure solid and credible security guarantees”. On the security guarantees for Ukraine, Meloni said on Saturday that Trump had highlighted an Italian proposal during his summit with Putin in Anchorage that was “inspired by Nato’s Article 5”. “The starting point of the proposal is the definition of a collective security clause that would allow Ukraine to benefit from the support of all its partners, including the USA, ready to take action in case it is attacked again,” Meloni added. Meloni also referred to the Trump-Putin meeting as having “finally” opened up “a glimmer of hope” on discussions of peace in Ukraine. Meloni last travelled to Washington in April for a bilateral with Trump. The pair met again in Rome just over a week later for the funeral of Pope Francis, before which Trump and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a brief but symbolic one-to-one talk in St Peter’s Basilica. Meloni was the only European leader to attend Trump’s inauguration as US president in January, and before that made a flying visit to his Mar-a-Lago golf club. In a separate social media clip, recorded on the plane en route to Washington, we get to hear directly from the UK prime minister. Starmer says: “This war in Ukraine has been going on a really long time now, three plus years. It’s hugely impacted the Ukrainians who have suffered hugely, but it’s also impacted Europe, it’s impacted every single family and community in the United Kingdom. And so everybody wants it to end, not least the Ukrainians. But we’ve got to get this right. We’ve got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that it is fair and that it is just. And that’s why I’m travelling to Washington with other European leaders to discuss this face to face with President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Because it’s in everyone’s interests, it’s in the UK’s interests that we get this right.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer’s spokesperson has been speaking to the media in the last half hour, suggesting that the UK would back a Ukraine peace deal without a ceasefire as a precondition, PA reported. “We’ve always said we want to see a sustainable and just peace for Ukraine. One that ensures peace returns to Europe and the Ukrainian people can live without fear of attack again, and an agreement that delivers that as soon as possible, but ends the killing and translates that into a lasting peace supported by security guarantees, would be a significantly positive step.” Pressed on whether that marked a change of position, Starmer’s spokesperson said: “We want to see an end to the killing. If you can bring about an end to the killing and bring about a sustained peace in one go, then all the better.” Ukraine’s borders are for the country to determine itself in negotiations, he added, stressing that “international borders must not be changed by force.” in Berlin Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz, who boarded a dawn flight to Washington on Monday, had found a silver lining for the Europeans out of the Alaska summit, saying on Saturday the United States was ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine under a peace deal. Trump’s pledge, however, was decidedly vague, as European leaders said at least some US boots would need to be on the ground in Ukraine for the guarantee to carry any weight as a deterrent against further Russian aggression. After Trump advisor Steve Witkoff suggested the security guarantees could be comparable to an Article 5 mutual defence protection within Nato, it begged the question whether the Europeans would commit troops of their own for Ukraine. At least in Germany, the response appeared muted at best. German vice-chancellor Lars Klingbeil told ZDF public television he wouldn’t rule anything out but stopped well-short of a full-throated pledge. “Now it’s about getting a ceasefire and then we can talk about everything else,” said Klingbeil, a Social Democrat. But for the foreign minister, Johann Wadephul of Merz’s Christian Democrats (CDU), the answer was a flat no, citing the growing presence of German soldiers in Lithuania - Berlin’s first permanent foreign troop deployment since the second world war. “To do that (station an armoured brigade in Lithuania) and on top of that station troops in Ukraine would probably overtax us,” Wadephul told podcast Table.Today. German officials attempted to sound bullish ahead of Monday’s meetings in Washington, underlining the united European front. “Speaking directly with Donald Trump in person will certainly have an impact,” CDU MP Norbert Röttgen, a leading voice on foreign policy, told the German edition of Politico. We see ourselves as Ukraine’s main supporter. European security is now a European matter – but we want to keep the Americans on board. Armin Laschet, head of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, saw the glass half full after the Alaska talks, noting that the lack of a deal also meant that no one-sided deal was agreed without Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Regarding any commitment of German troops as part of a security guarantee, Laschet told Berlin’s Inforadio he did not rule it out but remained guarded. “You can’t answer the question until you know the conditions. Is it in agreement with the United Nations? Is there a UN mandate? Did Russia agree to it?” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered his response to overnight Russian strikes on Ukraine saying they were “demonstrative” of Russian intentions and showing its “cynical” position on war. He said: “And at this very moment, the Russians are attacking Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, the Sumy region, and Odesa, destroying residential buildings and our civilian infrastructure. Russians are deliberately killing people, particularly children. As of now, seven people have been killed as a result of the drone strike in Kharkiv, the youngest being a girl who is only a year and a half old, and dozens have been injured, including children. In Zaporizhzhia, missile strikes injured 20 people and killed three. My condolences go out to all of the victims’ families and loved ones. There was also a deliberate Russian strike on an energy facility in Odesa owned by an Azerbaijani company, implying that it was an attack not only on us but also on our relations and energy security.” He also pointed out the obvious context of the attacks: “They are aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war. We will have a discussion with President Trump about key issues. Along with Ukraine, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the European Union, and Nato will participate in the conversation. Everyone seeks dignified peace and true security.” In a stark warning about Russia’s intentions, Zelenskyy also said that “the Russian war machine continues to destroy lives despite everything,” as “Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts".” “That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings. That is why reliable security guarantees are required. That is why Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war. The war must be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: ‘Stop.’” Meanwhile, the Ukrainian foreign minister clashed with his Hungarian counterpart on social media this morning after Hungary accused Ukraine of an attack on a Russian oil pipeline. Earlier this morning, Péter Szijjártó heavily criticised Ukraine for an attack on a Russian pipeline leading to Hungary, calling it “outrageous” and “unacceptable.” The Hungarian minister said: “Ukraine has once again attacked the oil pipeline leading to Hungary, cutting off supplies. This latest strike against our energy security is outrageous and unacceptable! Russian deputy energy minister Pavel Sorokin informed me that experts are working to restore the transformer station essential for operating the pipeline, but for now they cannot say when deliveries will resume. For 3.5 years Brussels and Kyiv have tried to drag Hungary into the war in Ukraine. These repeated Ukrainian attacks on our energy supply serve that same purpose. Let me be clear: this is not our war. We have nothing to do with it, and as long as we are in charge, Hungary will stay out of it. Finally, a reminder to Ukrainian decision-makers: electricity from Hungary plays a vital role in powering your country …” His comments, including a thinly veiled threat against Ukraine, sparked an immediate reaction from Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, telling him to take his complaints to Moscow. “Peter, it is Russia, not Ukraine, who began this war and refuses to end it. Hungary has been told for years that Moscow is an unreliable partner. Despite this, Hungary has made every effort to maintain its reliance on Russia. Even after the full-scale war began. You can now send your complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow.” Separately, at least seven people were killed and some 20 injured in a separate attack on Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, agencies reported. Six children aged 6 to 17 were among 20 other people injured in the attack on Ukraine’s second largest city, Oleh Synehubov, governor of the wider Kharkiv region, wrote on Telegram. A ballistic missile attack shattered around 1,000 windows in various buildings in the city, Synehubov said. Some residents had to be evacuated from their homes, officials said. “Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure,” Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X after the attack. The number of people injured in the Russian shelling of Zaporizhzhia has increased to 17, according to the latest update from the Ukrainian army. Its statement added: The number of victims is being specified. The blast wave and debris damaged residential buildings and commercial premises, and a bus stop was partially destroyed. The necessary services are working at the scene. Meanwhile, showing growing concern about how the signals coming from the US are being understood by Russia, Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, posted a video of a Russian armoured vehicle carrying two flags, of Russia and the US. “Russian propagandists show a video in which Russian military equipment goes on the assault with the flags of Russia and the US.” He continued: “The Russians are using the symbols of the US in their own terrorist war of aggression, marked by the killing of civilians.” “Utter arrogance,” he added. In one of many posts on social media overnight, US president Donald Trump claimed that “president Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to”. His comments are likely to alarm European leaders as they could signal growing US pressure on Ukraine to accept a deal, however imperfect or outright bad it is, as Trump is determined to secure a diplomatic success after his meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday. We all remember what happened during Zelenskyy’s last visit to the White House – even if US state secretary, Marco Rubio, appeared to play down apparent similarities between the two visit in his TV interview over the weekend. But, even more worringly for Europe, Trump also added: “Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!” This position by Trump appears to violate one of the European red lines for Ukraine, saying that Ukraine must not be blocked from deciding about its future. On Saturday, European leaders adopted a statement saying: “No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato. It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.” It’s hard to reconcile the two positions – and there will be some concern that by meeting Zelenskyy first, without the Europeans, Trump could seek to pursue this line even further before he sees a concerted push back from European partners. One to watch. In the last few minutes, Finland’s prime minister Petteri Orpo said that a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine are the most important topics at the meeting of US president Donald Trump, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, will be among those in attendance. It’s Jakub Krupa here, taking over to guide you through the day as we build up to the main event in Washington this evening. Good morning. Asked behind the scenes at June’s G7 summit if he could explain why Donald Trump seemed to like him so much, Keir Starmer admitted he did not really know. But whatever the reason, when it comes to Ukraine, the UK prime minister is once again hoping to exploit this somewhat curious relationship, Peter Walker writes in this analysis. It continues: As soon as it was announced that a string of European leaders planned to join Volodymyr Zelenskyy to back the Ukrainian president in crucial talks with Trump at the White House on Monday, it was obvious Starmer would be joining them. The idea of Britain being some sort of bridge between US and European interests is something of a longstanding UK diplomatic cliche, and not one that always necessarily carries much meaning. But in the case of Ukraine, Starmer has very deliberately sought to position himself as a leader who can get along with Trump while consistently stressing to him Europe’s red lines over any peace plan, and trying to sweet-talk the president into offering US security guarantees. You can read the full analysis here: A Ukrainian drone intercepted by Russia near the Smolensk nuclear power plant detonated after falling but did not cause significant damage to the plant, Russia’s nuclear power corporation Rosatom said on Monday. “The damage is insignificant, there are no casualties,” Rosatom said. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Sunday it had prevented a Ukrainian drone attack on the Smolensk nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. A Russian drone attack on a five-storey apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv early Monday killed five people and wounded more than a dozen others, Ukrainian authorities said. The attack, which took place just before dawn, reduced part of the building to rubble and sparked fires on at least three floors, the region’s governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram. Russia fired four drones at the building, he said. Ukraine’s state emergency service posted videos showing rescuers attempting to break through the rubble to reach a trapped resident, while another showed a floor in flames, AFP reports. “Five people were killed, including a girl aged about one-and-a-half years old,” Ukraine’s prosecution service said. “At least 18 people were wounded and suffered acute shock, including children.” The city near the Russian border was also hit hours earlier by a ballistic missile that wounded at least 11 people, Mayor Igor Terekhov said. Russia also struck the southern Odesa region with drones early Monday, sparking a fire at a fuel facility, regional governor Oleg Kiper said. Ukraine’s air force said on Monday that Russia had launched four missiles and 140 drones during an overnight attack on Ukraine, Reuters reports. The air force downed 88 drones and recorded hits in 25 locations across six Ukrainian regions, according to the statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Ukraine’s foreign minister says Russia continues to kill civilians despite peace efforts ahead of the US and Ukrainian presidential summit. “Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure,” Andrii Sybiha wrote on X on Monday after a Russian attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Sybiha also posted a photo of the smoking damage to a building, saying: This is a residential building in Kharkiv. This night Russia killed at least four people here, including a child, and injured many more … Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will make his second visit to the White House on Monday with the daunting task of reversing the damage done to Ukraine’s security prospects by Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. But as Julian Borger writes in this analysis, the Ukrainian president will not be alone as he was on his first trip to the White House in February, when he was ambushed and humiliated by Donald Trump and vice-president JD Vance, who sought to bully him into capitulation to Moscow’s demands. This time the Ukrainian leader comes to Washington flanked by a dream team of European leaders, including Britain’s Keir Starmer, Germany’s Friedrich Merz and France’s Emmanuel Macron, who combine economic and military clout with proven rapport with Trump. Their mission will be to use their individual and combined influence to coax the president out of the pro-Russian positions he adopted after just a couple of hours under Putin’s sway in the sub-Arctic on Friday. The full analysis is here: Germany’s foreign minister has called for stepped-up pressure on Russia, including more aid for Ukraine, to push Moscow into concessions toward a “just and lasting peace”. Johann Wadephul was speaking in Tokyo ahead of the summit between Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders including German chancellor Friedrich Merz. “It is probably not an exaggeration to say the whole world is looking to Washington,” Reuters quotes Wadephul as saying at a press briefing on Monday alongside Japan’s foreign minister. “Firm security guarantees are central” because “Ukraine must be able to defend itself effectively even after a ceasefire and peace agreement”, he added. The White House has released the timings for the day’s events in Washington DC. Donald Trump is to hold a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at 1.15pm (5.15pm GMT) on Monday at the White House. Trump will then participate in a multilateral meeting with European leaders visiting Washington at 3pm (7pm GMT). Here are some of the scenes in Washington DC amid the security operation for the crucial leaders’ summit. In saying “peace must be lasting”, Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said on X that must be “not like it was years ago, when Ukraine was forced to give up Crimea and part of our East –part of Donbas – and Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack”. “Or when Ukraine was given so called ‘security guarantees’ in 1994, but they didn’t work,” the Ukrainian president said. Now, our soldiers have successes in Donetsk and Sumy regions. I am confident that we will defend Ukraine, effectively guarantee security, and that our people will always be grateful to President Trump, everyone in America, and every partner and ally for their support and invaluable assistance. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared “Russia must end this war” as he arrived in Washington DC ahead of crucial talks with Donald Trump over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A host of European leaders will join Zelenskyy on Monday for the summit as they seek to provide a counterpoint to Vladimir Putin’s arguments following his talks with the US president on Friday. The leaders – British prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni and Finnish president Alexander Stubb – cleared their diaries to fly to the US at short notice, which is seen as a measure of how alarmed they were by Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Anchorage. After the Alaska talks Trump reportedly endorsed the Kremlin’s plan to end the war in Ukraine, including Kyiv giving up territory that Russia has been unable to seize and no ceasefire until a final deal has been agreed. Zelenskyy said in a post on X after arriving in Washington DC late on Sunday that he was grateful to Trump for the invitation and “we all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably”. He also said that “peace must be lasting”. “Russia must end this war, which it itself started,” Zelenskyy said. “And I hope that our joint strength with America, with our European friends, will force Russia into a real peace.” Here are some of the latest developments: Zelenskyy met European leaders in Brussels earlier on Sunday and reiterated Ukraine’s stance on land swaps, saying on X: “Ukraine’s constitution makes it impossible to give up or trade land. Since the territorial issue is so important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at the trilateral – Ukraine, the US, Russia. So far, Russia gives no sign this will happen, and if Russia refuses, new sanctions must follow.” Ahead of Monday’s peace talks in the US, Emmanuel Macron said that in order to have a “lasting peace deal for Ukraine, Ukraine needs a strong army”. He added that European allies want “Ukraine’s territorial integrity to be respected” and that “Ukraine must be represented in any talks on Ukraine’s future”. The French president also said that “our goal for tomorrow’s talks is to present a united front between Ukraine and its European allies”. The Washington talks will also be attended by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte. Zelenskyy has hailed the decision to offer security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal as he prepared to meet Trump. “Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air and at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation,” the Ukrainian president said. In announcing his visit to Washington, Keir Starmer praised Trump for his “efforts to end Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”. At the same time, the British PM reasserted Europe’s red lines, saying the “path to peace” could not be decided without Zelenskyy and that Russia should be “squeezed” with further sanctions. Starmer has deliberately sought to position himself as a leader who can get along with Trump while consistently stressing the red lines over any peace plan. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Russia and Ukraine were both “going to have to make concessions” for there to be a peaceful resolution to the war. In interviews on Sunday Rubio said the talks in Alaska had “made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement – but there remains some big areas of disagreement”. “We’re still a long ways off,” Rubio added. “We’re not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We’re not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made and towards one.” He declined to go into specific areas of agreement or disagreement. Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Putin had agreed that the US and European allies could offer Ukraine a Nato-style, “Article 5-like” security guarantee as part of an eventual deal to end the war. Witkoff added that Russia had agreed to unspecified concessions on five Ukrainian regions central to the war, particularly the eastern Donetsk province. “We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as gamechanging,” he said. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agreed that any future peace agreement must provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but added that Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees”. European Union council president Antonio Costa said he “welcomed the United States’ willingness to participate in providing security guarantees to Ukraine”. He also said: “Transatlantic unity is paramount at this moment to achieve a sustainable peace in Ukraine.”
