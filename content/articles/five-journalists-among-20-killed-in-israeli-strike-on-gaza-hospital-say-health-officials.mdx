  Five journalists were among at least 20 people killed by Israeli strikes on
  Nasser hospital in southern Gaza, health officials said. The strikes on Monday
  killed Hussam al-Masri, who worked for Reuters, Mariam Abu Dagga, who worked
  for the Associated Press, the Al Jazeera journalist Mohammed Salam, the
  photojournalist Moaz Abu Taha , and Ahmad Abu Aziz from Quds Feed. Another
  Reuters journalist, Hatem Khaled, was wounded in the attack. A video from the
  news agency Alghad TV showed civil defence workers wearing bright orange vests
  and journalists being hit by a bomb while they were attempting to rescue the
  body of Masri, who was killed in an earlier strike on the fourth floor of the
  hospital. In the moments before their deaths, they raised their hands to
  shield themselves, but were killed by the explosion. The second bomb struck
  the same spot on the fourth floor as the first, after rescue crews had
  arrived, the Gaza health ministry said. A video later showed a pile of bodies
  lying where the journalists and civil defence workers were standing at the
  moment of the strike. The Associated Press said in a statement that it was
  shocked and saddened to learn of Dagga’s death, as well as the deaths of the
  other journalists killed alongside her. “We are doing everything we can to
  keep our journalists in Gaza safe as they continue to provide crucial
  eyewitness reporting in difficult and dangerous conditions,” the agency said.
  Reuters said in a statement that it was devastated at the news of the death of
  al-Masri and wounding of Khaled. ”We are urgently seeking more information and
  have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical
  assistance for Hatem,” a spokesperson said. At least 192 Palestinian
  journalists have been killed since 7 October 2023, according to the Committee
  to Protect Journalists (CPJ), more than the number who died globally in the
  previous three years. The CPJ said in August that Israel’s killing of
  journalists in Gaza was “a deliberate and systematic attempt to cover up
  Israel’s actions”. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said the
  chief-of-staff had ordered a preliminary investigation into the strike and
  said Israel “expressed regret for injury to uninvolved personnel”. Israel did
  not target journalists, they said. Israeli inquiries into misconduct by its
  military rarely ensure accountability. A report published this month shows
  that 88% of investigations into war crimes allegations in Gaza were shut down
  or left unresolved. Israel’s investigation into the killing of the
  Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by an Israeli
  sniper in 2022 was never finished. Dagga, 33, had freelanced for the AP since
  the Gaza war began, as well as other news outlets such as Independent Arabia.
  She reported on Nasser hospital doctors struggling to save children with no
  previous health issues who were wasting away from starvation. Independent
  Arabia said Dagga was the “example of dedication and professional commitment”
  and that she carried “her camera into the heart of the field, conveying the
  suffering of civilians and the voices of victims with rare honesty and
  courage”. Abu Aziz was based out of Nasser hospital, where he covered the
  impact of Israel’s attacks on people across Gaza. He lost several colleagues
  during the war, as well as his own home that was levelled in a strike. “It
  felt like I was all alone and the only one left on the ground as so many more
  of my colleagues were being killed,” Abu Aziz wrote in an article for Middle
  East Eye a year ago about his experience as a journalist in Gaza. Al Jazeera
  confirmed that Salam was among those killed in the Nasser hospital strike.
  Reuters reported that Masri, a contractor cameraman, was also killed. Khaled,
  a photographer who was also a Reuters contractor, was wounded, the news agency
  reported. Israel has prevented international media from covering the 22-month
  conflict, an unprecedented ban in the history of war reporting. Palestinian
  journalists in Gaza who work with international outlets carry out their duties
  while facing starvation and the risk of death. The Palestinian ministry of
  health said Monday’s strikes on Nasser hospital had disrupted surgery in the
  operating theatre, and condemned the attack, which it said was part of a
  “systematic destruction of the health system”. Nasser hospital is the only
  functioning public hospital left in southern Gaza. Health officials also
  reported gunfire that killed people seeking aid in central Gaza and airstrikes
  in Gaza City. At least six people were killed and 15 wounded while trying to
  reach a food distribution site in central Gaza operated by the private
  US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Shootings by Israeli soldiers
  near GHF sites are a near daily occurrence, though the Israeli military and
  GHF deny targeting people seeking food. A strike on a residential
  neighbourhood in Gaza City killed at least three people, including a child.
  Israel is preparing for an invasion of the city in the coming days, which it
  says it will occupy and take control of. Aid groups have said the operation
  would lead to displacement and a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which is
  already in the throes of famine. At least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed
  since the beginning of the Gaza war 22 months ago. Israel launched its assault
  after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants in which
  about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.
