  “We threw seeds into the lake hundreds of times, but nothing grew. It’s only
  now, after the silt was cleared, that we see the flowers again after nearly 33
  years,” says Bashir Ahmad, a 65-year-old who fishes in Kashmir’s Wular Lake
  for his livelihood. Wular was once among Asia’s largest freshwater lakes. It
  lies in the Kashmir valley, about 18 miles (30km) north-west of Srinagar, at
  the foot of the Pir Panjal and Himalayan mountain ranges. It was renowned for
  its high-quality lotus plants, and sustained the livelihoods of more than
  5,000 people who harvested and sold nadru – the edible lotus stem cherished as
  a delicacy in Kashmiri households and which features in wazwan, the region’s
  traditional multi-course celebratory meals. Then, in 1992, devastating floods
  hit the region. They choked the lake bed with silt, wiping out the lotus
  plants and plunging families into poverty. The prized stems gradually
  disappeared as an ingredient used in local kitchens. Over the next three
  decades, the condition of the lake – designated as a Ramsar wetland of
  international importance since 1990 – worsened, Bashir says. Parts were turned
  into dumping grounds and its area was drastically reduced. While in 1911 it
  spanned 217 sq km (84 sq miles), with 58 sq km of marshes, by 2007 the lake
  had shrunk by nearly two-thirds to cover just 86 sq km, according to the Jammu
  and Kashmir regional government. An official survey blames the shrinkage
  largely on land being converted for farming, which also led to a 17% decline
  in the lake’s fauna. Expanding willow plantations around the lake increased
  the buildup of silt. The trees acted as barriers, disrupting the flow of the
  river and causing sediment to accumulate. In 2020, the Wular Conservation and
  Management Authority (Wucma) began a de-silting programme to restore the
  lake’s depth and remove waste carried down by the Jhelum River and its
  tributaries. Officials say more than 7.9m cubic metres of silt have been
  removed from the lake so far. More than 2 million willows have been uprooted.
  Five years on, the lotus flowers are blooming again. Ahmad, whose four
  brothers also depend on the lake for their livelihood, says that seeing the
  lotus bloom again feels like a dream come true. “We had lost all hope that it
  would ever return. Some in our community even took up other work, like
  labouring, to survive. But we waited,” he says. “Our elders used to collect
  lotus stems from the lake and sell them in various markets across the valley,
  especially during special occasions,” he says. “After the lotus disappeared,
  they turned to fishing, but that didn’t prove as sustainable. The return of
  the lotus has brought back hope.” Ahmad’s brother, Mohammad Fayaz Dar, says
  that after the lotus stems disappeared, nadru also gradually vanished from
  local diets. “But now, we believe it will be revived completely,” he says. The
  dishes made with it, Dar adds, hold deep cultural significance for Kashmiri
  families: “Lotus stem connects our food to the land. Its absence changed
  menus. “Now that it’s back, we’re preparing dishes the way our grandmothers
  did – slow, simple, and full of memory,” said Tavir Ahmad, a chef in a Kashmir
  market. Wucma officials said the revival of the lotus would help boost the
  local economy, which was otherwise on the verge of collapse. “It’s public
  property, but people need to take care of it,” said Showket Ahmad, a Wucma
  employee. He says that although lotus stems had not been visible in the lake
  for years, the roots had probably remained dormant – buried under layers of
  silt. “After we cleared silt from specific areas, lotus plants started
  re-emerging,” he says. Historically, the lake has sustained fishing
  communities and harvesters of water chestnuts. It remains a critical habitat
  for migratory birds, including the Siberian crane. “This is not just the
  revival of a plant, it’s the resurrection of a cultural ecosystem,” said Meera
  Sharma, a Delhi-based environmentalist. “When nature heals, it revives
  everything it once nurtured – livelihoods, traditions, biodiversity. “The
  return of the lotus in Wular is a profound reminder that environmental
  restoration isn’t just about aesthetics or data points; it’s about restoring
  human connection with the land,” she says. “Seeing these flowers bloom again
  after decades is like watching history breathe.” Find more age of extinction
