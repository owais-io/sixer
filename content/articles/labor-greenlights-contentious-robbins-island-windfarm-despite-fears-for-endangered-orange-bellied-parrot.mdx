  The Albanese government has greenlit a contentious windfarm proposed for
  Robbins Island off north-western Tasmania, promising to impose conditions to
  protect threatened bird species, including the critically endangered
  orange-bellied parrot. The environment minister, Murray Watt, announced on
  Friday that he had approved an application by the renewable energy company
  Acen Australia to build up to 100 turbines, a 1.2km bridge between the nearly
  10,000-hectare island and the Tasmanian mainland, a 500-metre wharf and four
  quarries. Watt acknowledged the decision would be divisive but said “the
  reality is we need more renewable energy being built in Australia to tackle
  the climate change challenge that we have”. He said putting in place “strong
  environmental protections to avoid and reduce environmental damage” was key.
  “That’s what I believe we’ve done [here],” he said. Watt said his approval
  came with strict conditions to protect several species that conservationists
  and scientists say are at risk from the development, including the
  orange-bellied parrot, Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, Tasmanian devil and
  several protected migratory shorebirds. Many of these conditions relate to the
  parrot, which has a wild population of fewer than 100 and is the focus of an
  intensive government-funded recovery effort. The conditions include a
  requirement that Acen conduct comprehensive parrot surveys for three years
  before construction can begin. Sign up to get climate and environment editor

  eight years after the development was first proposed, was welcomed by the
  Tasmanian Liberal government and Labor opposition, as well as the state’s
  chamber of commerce and industry. Acen Australia’s managing director, David
  Pollington, called it a “major step in unlocking one of the largest private
  investments in Tasmania’s history and positioning the state as a major player
  in Australia’s clean energy transition”. But the announcement was sharply
  criticised by environment organisation the Bob Brown Foundation, which said
  the farm would be “wildlife killing” and accused the company of failing to
  carry out adequate bird surveys. Birdlife Australia has previously called for
  the windfarm to be blocked and for Robbins Island to be declared a “no-go
  site”, calling it the most important site for shorebirds in Tasmania. Some
  migratory shorebird populations are estimated to have fallen by more than 70%
  since late last century. Christine Milne, a former Greens leader and a patron
  with the Bob Brown Foundation, said allowing a windfarm to be built at the
  southern end of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway for migratory birds was a
  “huge assault on nature and on rare birds”. She said the decision was
  “devastating for threatened species, for the environment, for the north of
  Tasmania”. “Of course we need to have renewable energy, but every project
  should be assessed on its merits, not just flicked through on the basis that
  we’re going to fast-track renewable energy,” she said. “Biodiversity and
  climate are two sides of the same coin and it is not a climate-plus to destroy
  threatened species.” The Greens also condemned Watt’s decision. Tasmanian
  Greens MP Vica Bayley said: “Scientists and community representatives have
  long-raised concerns about the damage a windfarm would do to the native
  wildlife of the area, but they’ve been consistently ignored, and again
  dismissed today.” Watt said the 900MW development – which includes the 720MW
  Robbins Island farm and an already approved 180MW farm at nearby Jims Plain –
  had the potential to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 3.4m tonnes a year,
  equivalent to taking more than 1m cars off the road. He said conditions on the
  project included that Acen develop and implement a bird and bat management
  plan to “evaluate, mitigate and manage the risk of turbine collision for
  threatened birds”. He said this plan might need to include “curtailment or
  shutdown of all or some turbines” at certain times. Watt said Acen would also
  need to provide funding for an orange-bellied parrot conservation program,
  install barriers to avoid Tasmanian devils from the mainland crossing to the
  island and potentially affecting the local disease-free population, and
  protect 1,164 hectares of devils’ habitat on the island. Acen could not build
  turbines within 1km of a wedge-tailed eagle nest, he said. The company still
  needs separate approval for a 120km transmission line through forest and farms
  needed to connect the windfarm to the power grid. Robbins Island has been
  owned by the Hammond family, who use it to run Wagyu cattle, since the 1960s.
  It includes wetlands, heathland and woodlands, unusual geology, paddocks and
  pristine beaches. A windfarm has been proposed for the site since early this
  century. The current proposal appeared to have been effectively blocked in
  2022, when the Tasmanian Environment Protection Authority said it could
  operate for only seven months each year and must shut during orange-bellied
  parrots’ migration season. But the EPA ruling was overturned on appeal. A
  counter-appeal against the project by the community group Circular Head
  Coastal Awareness Network lost in the supreme court.
