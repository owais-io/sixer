  The UK economy grew at a faster rate than expected in the second quarter,
  official figures show, despite a slowdown from a strong start to the year amid
  pressure from tax increases and Donald Trump’s global trade war. Figures from
  the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed growth in gross domestic
  product slowed to 0.3% in the three months to the end of June, down from a
  rate of 0.7% in the first quarter. Although it beat forecasts for a slowdown
  to 0.1% made by City economists and the Bank of England, the latest snapshot
  underscores the challenge for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as she considers
  options for boosting the economy and raising revenues at her autumn budget.
  Liz McKeown, an ONS director of economic statistics, said: “Growth slowed in
  the second quarter after a strong start to the year. The economy was weak
  across April and May, with some activity having been brought forward to
  February and March ahead of stamp duty and tariff changes, but then recovered
  strongly in June.” The latest snapshot showed the economy grew 0.4% in June, a
  faster rate than expected after two consecutive months of shrinking output.
  The ONS also revised its initial estimate for April’s GDP contraction from
  -0.3% to -0.1%. Reeves said the quarterly figures were positive as they showed
  Britain had recorded a strong start to the year and continued growth in the
  second quarter, “but there is more to do to deliver an economy that works for
  working people”. She said: “I know that the British economy has the key
  ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long.” According to the
  latest figures, growth in the second quarter was led by the country’s dominant
  services sector expanding by 0.4%, with computer programming, health and
  vehicle leasing driving activity. Construction output rose by 1.2%, supported
  by large infrastructure projects. Manufacturing grew by 0.3%, after growth of
  1.1% in the first quarter when companies had rushed to beat the introduction
  of Trump’s tariffs. Despite the second-quarter slowdown, the latest figures
  show the UK currently remains the fastest-growing G7 economy over the first
  half of the year, pending data from Japan. However, the economy faces
  headwinds from Trump’s trade war and a sluggish domestic outlook. “We expect
  growth to slow in the second half,” said James Smith, an economist at ING. The
  chancellor is preparing for a difficult autumn budget amid mounting
  speculation over tax rises, as a weaker growth outlook, higher debt interest
  payments and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts contribute to a yawning
  deficit in the government finances that is estimated to be more than £40bn.
  Reeves has pledged to use the set-piece fiscal event to prioritise fixing
  Britain’s dismal productivity record, using an exclusive article in the
  Guardian to downplay speculation over tax rises. Business leaders said the
  economy had been dented by the chancellor’s £25bn increase in employer
  national insurance contributions and said more tax rises would cause further
  drag. “Without thriving firms the economy will continue to struggle,” said
  Stuart Morrison, the research manager at the British Chambers of Commerce.
  “Tax burdens at home, alongside uncertain global trading conditions, created a
  very challenging environment for the UK’s small- and medium-sized enterprises
  in the second quarter.” The latest figures showed business investment fell by
  4% in the second quarter, although it was 0.1% higher than a year earlier. Mel
  Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “Any economic growth is welcome, but with
  business leaders saying that all indicators are flashing red, and key
  economists warning that Rachel Reeves has created a £50bn black hole in the
  public finances, Rachel Reeves’s economic vandalism is clear.” The
  stronger-than-expected second quarter could complicate the Bank of England’s
  path to cutting interest rates further. The pound rose slightly against the US
  dollar. Threadneedle Street had forecast a slowdown to 0.1% in the second
  quarter. Last week it warned that continued growth and rising inflationary
  pressures driven by the soaring price of food could force it to delay further
  cuts to borrowing costs. Nicholas Hyett, the investment manager at the broker
  Wealth Club, said the figures raised “some interesting questions” for the Bank
  after it cut its key base rate from 4.25% to 4% last week. “Better leave the
  economy sputtering into life than risk turbocharging price rises with further
  interest rate cuts,” he said.
