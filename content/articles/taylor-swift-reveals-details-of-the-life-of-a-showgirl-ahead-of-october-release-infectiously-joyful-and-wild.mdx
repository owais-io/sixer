  Taylor Swift has revealed more details about her upcoming album, The Life of a
  Showgirl, which includes a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter on the title
  track and will be released 3 October. The singer shared the cover and track
  listing for The Life of a Showgirl on Wednesday night, timed for her
  appearance on her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s podcast New Heights, which he hosts
  with his brother, the former fellow professional footballer Jason Kelce. The
  Life of a Showgirl has 12 tracks – a nod to this being her 12th album – and
  includes a cover of George Michael’s 1987 song Father Figure. Swift told the
  Kelce brothers that the album was recorded in Europe while she was on her
  global Eras tour and is inspired by her life while spending two years on the
  road. The Eras tour became the first billion-dollar tour in history and ended
  up making more than US$2bn over 21 months. “This album is about what was going
  on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant
  and electric and vibrant,” she said. “I’m so proud of it. And it comes from
  the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life, so
  that effervescence has come through on this record. So as you said, bangers.”
  Unlike her previous album, The Tortured Poets Department, she would not be
  dropping a second surprise album right afterwards, she said. “There are no
  other songs coming … with Tortured Poets Department, I was like, ‘Here is a
  data dump of everything I have thought, felt, experienced in two or three
  years. Here’s 31 songs.’ This is 12. There’s not a 13th, there’s not other
  ones coming. This is the record I’ve been wanting to make for a very long
  time.” The track listing is: The Fate of Ophelia Elizabeth Taylor Opalite
  Father Figure Eldest Daughter Ruin the Friendship Actually Romantic Wi$h Li$t
  Wood Cancelled! Honey The Life of a Showgirl featuring Sabrina Carpenter The
  album marks the return of Max Martin and Shellback, the Swedish producers who
  worked on Swift’s albums Red, 1989 and Reputation. Swift called the two men
  “geniuses” and credited them for working on her favourite of her songs
  including Shake It Off and Blank Space. Fans have long speculated that her
  next songs will draw on Swift’s relationship with Kelce, which they revealed
  publicly in 2023. “Every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons.
  You couldn’t take one out and it be the same album, you couldn’t add one. It
  is just right. That focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album
  and keeping the bar really high is something I have wanted to do for a very
  long time,” Swift said. “I tend to love to write lots and lots of music, so
  it’s a temptation to release lots of music,” she added. “But I wanted to do an
  album that was so focused on quality and the theme and everything fitting
  together like a perfect puzzle that these 12 songs for my 12th album – I feel
  we achieved that.” Her main goals, she said, were “melodies that were so
  infectious that you’re almost angry at it” and lyrics that were “just as vivid
  but crisp and focused and completely intentional.” Swift is known for dropping
  hints and clues for her fans before album announcements and her 12th album was
  no different. On Monday night on Instagram, Taylor Nation – a branch of
  Swift’s official marketing team – shared a carousel of 12 images from the Eras
  Tour, writing in the caption: “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era
  … ’” Soon after, a countdown to 12.12am eastern time on 12 August appeared on
  her website, which was transformed to a glittering orange. At 12.12am Swift’s
  website briefly crashed, before reappearing with scant details about The Life
  of a Showgirl. The 35-year-old is among the world’s bestselling musicians,
  selling an estimated 200m records globally, and she holds the record for most
  No 1 albums in the US by a female artist in history. Her last album, 2024’s
  The Tortured Poets Department, set a streaming record on Spotify – 300m in one
  day and 1bn in five – and made her the first artist in history to secure the
  top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100.
