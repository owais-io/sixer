  Rachel Reeves is considering plans for a tax on expensive homes in an effort
  to raise billions of pounds and close a large hole in the public finances. The
  UK chancellor has ruled out increases to income tax, VAT and national
  insurance, but Treasury officials have been tasked with exploring other
  options to boost revenue. One proposal being considered would be to remove the
  longstanding capital gains tax exemption on primary residences above £1.5m,
  according to the Times. Homeowners selling properties above that level would
  be subject to a capital gains tax at 18% for basic-rate taxpayers and 24% for
  higher taxpayers. The proposals are set out to raise between £30bn and £40bn
  to stabilise the public finances while allowing Reeves to stick to her
  election pledge not to raise the three biggest taxes on income and
  consumption. When asked about the report, a Treasury source said they would
  not comment on “speculation”. Reports have also suggested officials are
  considering wider changes to the way property wealth is taxed. Reports
  suggested an annual levy on higher-value properties had been considered. The
  suggestion from the thinktank Onward had urged the Treasury to impose an
  annual charge of 0.54% on the portion of a home’s value above £500,000, rising
  to 0.81% on the portion above £1m, though officials stressed no decisions had
  been made. Meanwhile, the Guardian reported that ministers have been
  considering replacing stamp duty with a new national property tax, payable by
  owner-occupiers when homes are sold. It could be accompanied by a longer-term
  plan to replace council tax with a proportional levy linked directly to
  property values. Buyers pay stamp duty under the existing framework if they
  purchase property worth more than £125,000. The new levy would be paid by
  owner-occupiers on houses worth more than £500,000 when they sell their home,
  with the amount due determined by the value of the property and a rate set by
  the government. Critics say heavier taxation of property risks discouraging
  older homeowners from downsizing, weakening the housing market. But it has
  been argued that Britain’s tax system needs to be made fairer and that wealth
  tied up in property cannot be ignored as she attempts to balance the books.
  This month, Keir Starmer said Reeves’s upcoming budget would “build on what
  we’ve done” by focusing on living standards and “making sure that people feel
  better off”. The prime minister had sought to play down warnings that the
  government would be forced to raise taxes this autumn and said some of the
  figures being circulated “are not ones I recognise”. Starmer was responding to
  forecasts from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR),
  which projected a shortfall of up to £51bn in the public finances, given a
  number of factors had knocked the chancellor’s plans to stay within Whitehall
  spending limits, including higher debt interest payments and a U-turn on
  welfare spending cuts.
