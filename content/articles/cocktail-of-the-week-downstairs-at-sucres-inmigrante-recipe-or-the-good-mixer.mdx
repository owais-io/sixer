bodyText: >-
  If you don’t have Italicus, you could use limoncello as a substitute - it
  doesn’t have quite the same profile, though. The first dry shake (ie, without
  any ice) isn’t 100% necessary, but it does give the best results. Inmigrante
  30ml joven (young) mezcal – we use Ojo de Dios 20ml Aperol 10ml Italicus
  Rosolio di Bergamotto, or limoncello at a push 10ml vanilla syrup (homemade or
  bought in) 20ml fresh lime juice 3 dashes Ms Better’s Miraculous Foamer, or 1
  egg white, or 25ml aquafaba 1 sprig rosemary, or 1 edible flower, to garnish
  Measure all the liquids into a shaker, dry shake for 10 seconds, then add a
  big handful of ice and shake hard for 10-15 seconds, to chill and aerate the
  drink. Double-strain into a chilled nick &amp; nora or martini glass, garnish
  with a sprig of rosemary (or an edible flower) and serve. Glenn Gicquel, head
  bartender, Downstairs at Sucre, London W • This article was amended on 12
