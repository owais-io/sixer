  The widespread euphoria that surrounded Rory McIlroy’s Masters triumph served
  as the finest example of a moment when golf observers want a player to win.
  This, after all, is supposed to be a non-tribal environment aside from the
  weekend every two years when Europe face USA and people on either side of the
  ropes take leave of their senses. Golf’s next pursuit of the holy grail
  belongs to Tommy Fleetwood. Defeat from positions of strength at the Travelers
  and St Jude championships threw up an unwanted statistic. In 163 PGA Tour
  starts, Fleetwood is yet to emerge victorious. As striking as that raw number
  – Fleetwood’s talent is such that one assumes he should have claimed a batch
  of trophies in the US – is the fact people are willing him to end his drought.
  Fleetwood is relatable, likable, popular. He also has no objection to the
  discussion presently whirling around him. “I’m not going to feed you lies and
  say: ‘Oh, in Memphis I thought I did everything great, or Travelers I didn’t
  do anything wrong,’” Fleetwood said. “Of course I got things wrong down the
  stretch and it didn’t happen for me. “You learn from those experiences. I
  would rather you be questioning me about not finishing tournaments off than
  not questioning me at all about anything. So I’ve obviously shown a lot of
  really good stuff and put myself in great positions. “I just want to put
  myself there again. I want to give myself another chance. I’ll finish it off
  at some point. I’ll get it right and I’ll get it right more than once. But
  being there is actually the hard part, in a way. “I don’t feel like I have to
  rattle off all the good stuff. I just need to be aware of it, know that I’m
  doing the right things and know that there’s still things that I can get
  better. I use the disappointments as motivation and I use the good stuff as
  confidence boosting.” At East Lake this week, another PGA Tour season will
  conclude. Scottie Scheffler will look to press his dominance of the game by
  lifting the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup. Just as fate eventually smiled on
  McIlroy, a two-hour drive away in April, could it finally be Tommy’s time? His
  reliability and close shave history is emphasised by six runner-up finishes on
  the PGA Tour, the same number of thirds, 30 top fives and 44 top 10s. He is
  the 10th-ranked player in the world. “Best case scenario coming down the
  stretch at East Lake with a chance to win,” Fleetwood said. “Whether I get it
  right or not, whether it happens or not, whether someone plays better or not,
  I’ll talk about that at the time. But I would love to get there and give
  myself that chance again.” The 34-year-old has not been burned by falling
  short. “It’s funny really, you walk off the course on Sunday last week and I
  was happier with a fourth place finish than I was with a third in Memphis,”
  Fleetwood said. “It’s a strange game that way. I am very happy with the
  consistency of my golf and the level I’ve been playing at. Golf is a crazy
  game. You never know what you’re going to turn up with week in and week out
  but this year has been a very good year.” Fleetwood knows how to get over the
  line. He has done it eight times elsewhere in the world. He has been
  successful when involved in tight scraps. The nature of recent events, as
  opposed to core results, is what has brought Fleetwood’s situation into sharp
  focus. He missed out on a playoff in Memphis by a shot, having led by two with
  three holes to play. At the Travelers, Keegan Bradley usurped Fleetwood after
  the Southport man three-putted the 72nd hole. Fleetwood was clearly dejected
  during post-tournament media duties at both but there was no raw moment, no
  smashed club, no fist through a window. Yes, the smile had vanished but not
  for long. “I get disappointed and I get angry,” Fleetwood said. “I’ve thrown
  the odd club in the water when I’m out there and maybe feel a bit better for a
  while. But I’m not that great at being angry. It just doesn’t suit me. I just
  kind of let it go. I work really hard on letting things go, moving on. Not
  that much great comes from those moments of anger. “But like I say, like
  anybody, I get disappointed, I get frustrated, I get angry. I doubt myself. Of
  course I do. It’s all part of being a professional athlete and part of trying
  to chase your dreams and accomplish great things against unbelievable
  golfers.”
