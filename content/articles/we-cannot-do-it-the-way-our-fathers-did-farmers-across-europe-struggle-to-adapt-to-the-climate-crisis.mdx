  ‘We cannot do it the way our fathers did’: farmers across Europe struggle to
  adapt to the climate crisis

  “I’m not ready to change jobs,” says Stellios Boutaris, a wine producer with
  vineyards in Naoussa and Amyndeon in northern Greece, as well as on the island
  of Santorini. But, he adds, “we cannot do it the way our fathers did.”
  Boutaris is determined to keep producing in the region and keep the family
  business going but says “the curve is not looking good” as the climate crisis
  puts pressure on producers across the Mediterranean. Boutaris, who heads the
  Kir-Yianni wine producers’ group, is one of thousands of farmers in the south
  of Europe battling to continue producing on the lands their ancestors have
  farmed for decades, or even centuries, as increasingly extreme weather, such
  as this summer’s wildfires, rage across Spain, France and Greece. Their
  struggles mean the price of wine, olives, citrus fruits and vegetables are
  expected to continue to rise, as droughts, flash floods and high temperatures
  affect traditional crops in the Mediterranean. Boutaris is employing new
  tactics to tackle the problem, including installing irrigation and water
  storage and planting more vegetation among the vines to help the land hold
  more water and keep temperatures down. He is also buying higher land and
  seeking out different varieties of grapes which are more resilient to extreme
  weather. He has just invested €250,000 (£216,000) in irrigation and now plans
  to spend a further €200,000 (£173,000) on a project for 40 hectares of
  vineyards in Santorini. Producers across Europe will be forced to pass on such
  extra costs to consumers, in the form of higher prices, he argues. “Cheap wine
  is not going to be easy to find. It used to be that the south of France, Spain
  and Greece produced cheap wine of Europe. Now it is going to be very difficult
  to compete on price,” he says. Shoppers are already feeling the effects, as
  droughts in Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources much of its fresh
  fruit and vegetables during autumn and winter, push up prices this summer, at
  a time when prices would usually fall. This summer even farmers in parts of
  the UK have been hit by long dry spells affecting production of cereals,
  potatoes, carrots and broccoli, which are not usually irrigated. Things are
  expected to get far worse as a result of the climate crisis. In the EU, the
  average annual loss for crops is forecast to increase by up to two-thirds by
  2050 to as much as €24.8bn, according to analysis by the European Investment
  Bank (EIB) and the European Commission. By 2050, the most severe increase in
  drought risk is expected in Spain, Italy and Greece with more than nine times
  as many days of severe drought conditions each year compared to 1990 under the
  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s “middle of the road” projections.
  France, Italy, Spain and Romania are likely to see the largest absolute
  increases in crop losses – with average annual losses expected to increase by
  64%, or more than €1bn (£866m), with drought a major factor, according to the
  EIB and commission’s report. In 2022, for example, maize yields were down 24%
  on the previous year across Europe with Spain bearing the largest proportion
  of losses followed by France, Italy and Romania. Dr Peter Alexander, a
  professor of global food systems at the University of Edinburgh, says it is
  already possible to see the northern march of crops within Europe, with
  champagne producers investing in the UK and maize growing in Scotland. British
  farmers are experimenting with crops such as haricot beans and chickpeas,
  which historically have been difficult to grow, in the hope that they may
  thrive in a warming climate. One farmer in Essex has even planted more than
  1,000 olive trees with support from Belazu, the premium olive oil company.
  However, the more the climate crisis progresses the harder it becomes to adapt
  and the more costly it becomes. Alexander says this effect is already evident
  in more exotic crops, which require very specific growing conditions and are
  now under pressure, such as coffee and cocoa. “In high income countries they
  are available but less affordable,” he says. In southern Europe, family-owned
  farms are struggling to find the resources to fund adaptation to keep growing.
  “Already what we see is groves get abandoned and people can’t afford to be
  farmers any more,” says Sarah Vachon of the Citizens of Soil olive oil brand,
  which works with independent producers around the Mediterranean. She says
  farmers are looking at many ways to keep going, from irrigation to new
  varieties but “these are big investments for small farmers already living on
  the bread line and these things are difficult to get government funding for”.
  Boutaris says that, in Greece, there are areas where family farmers have
  already deserted land and chosen other lifestyles as it has become too
  difficult to farm. According to Alex Fernández Poulussen, a director of Good
  Stuff International, which is coordinating a collective water programme in the
  Guadalquivir river basin in southern Spain, action is necessary as water
  storage is less than half full in Spain and demand is very high. He says that
  the amount of land under cultivation in the area is likely to reduce with some
  farms being sold to investment funds for solar farms or being turned from
  citrus or avocado orchards to less thirsty crops such as wheat, maize, cereals
  or olives. After several years of drought in southern Spain, there are major
  projects to develop a coordinated approach to storing and using water more
  effectively, including new forms of irrigation. “Things need to change because
  of the climatic situation but there is a lot of proactive innovation and
  effort,” he says. Walter Zanre, the chief executive of the UK arm of olive oil
  brand Filippo Berio, says that production in Andalucía, Puglia, Sicily,
  Greece, Tunisia and Turkey is set to be affected by higher average
  temperatures and less rainfall. “There are many projects to try to conserve
  water and use it for irrigation. But in order to conserve water, first it has
  to rain. We have had winter rains this year, but in the previous three years
  it has been a virtual drought.” With concerns about future supplies, Filippo
  Berio has invested in storage tanks to hold an extra 3,000 tonnes of oil in
  the past five years and temporarily rented space for 1,000 more, as well as
  turning to a wider array of sources for olive oil, including Latin America.
  Lambert van Horen, an analyst at Rabobank, says the financial group is
  predicting that there will be no increase in agricultural production per
  hectare in Europe in the coming five years, ending decades of improvement
  aided by increased efficiency and better fertiliser. However, that means
  higher prices. “In the last five years prices of fresh produce have kept up
  with inflation or have been even higher than general inflation. In the next
  five years we expect food again to at least follow general inflation,” he
  says. “Farmers will get higher prices and they need that because their inputs
  are getting more expensive.” That could involve building more shade houses or
  greenhouses where temperatures and water flows can be more controlled,
  whatever the climate, to building more storage. “There will be more costs
  because adaptation, especially when crops are not so valuable such as grains
  where the revenue per hectare is relatively low,” says van Horen. In Greece so
  far it has been a decent year for many wine producers after two tough years.
  Still, with wildfires raging, many small farmers are considering their
  futures. Boutaris is determined to carry on: “There has got to be a way to do
  it and I want to show it can be done.”
