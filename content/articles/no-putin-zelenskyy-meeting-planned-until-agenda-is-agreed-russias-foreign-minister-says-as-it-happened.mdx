  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said
  there were no plans for Vladimir Putin to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the
  agenda for the meeting was “not ready at all.” “There is no meeting planned,”
  he said (13:40). Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said there were active
  discussions “at many levels” to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, as he
  insisted that they would offer greater protection than in previous, failed
  agreements in Minsk and Budapest (14:20, 14:23). Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy suggested that guarantees should be structured in a similar way to
  Nato’s core principle in Article 5 that an attack on one member is an attack
  on all (14:09). EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that “Russia does not
  want peace,” accusing Putin of ignoring demands to end the war and “just
  laughing – not stopping the killing, but increase the killing, … the bombings
  on Ukraine” (9:48). Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to
  guarantee security of supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the
  Druzbha pipeline could be suspended for at least five days following a
  Ukrainian attack on a linked facility in Russia (10:26). In other news, This
  hot and dry year has already emerged as the EU’s worst on record for wildfires
  – and there’s still one month of the fire season left to go (16:05). And
  that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or
  suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at

  correspondent In other news, this hot and dry year has already emerged as the
  EU’s worst on record for wildfires – and there’s still one month of the fire
  season left to go. New data from the European Forest Fire Information System
  (Effis) shows 1,015,024 hectares have burned so far this year, breaking the
  previous full-year record of 988,544 hectares that was set in 2017. Across the
  continent, and particularly in Spain and Portugal, deadly infernos have run
  riot this month – emptying out villages and forcing farmers to become
  firefighters. The blazes have engulfed four times as much land this year as
  the average for the same period over the past two decades, according to
  official data, and spewed out extreme levels of toxic smoke. Overwhelmed and
  underprepared, several governments have triggered the EU’s civil protection
  mechanism to help fight the flames. The Commission has sent help in the form
  of water-bombing planes and extra firefighters from neighbouring countries.
  Meanwhile, a Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to
  WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed
  on all mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month,
  the Russian government said on Thursday. The decision to promote Max comes as
  Moscow, locked in a standoff with the west over Ukraine, is seeking greater
  control over the internet. The Kremlin said in a statement that Max, which
  will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory
  pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”, including mobile phones and tablets, sold
  in Russia from 1 September. The firm behind Max said this week that 18 million
  users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase.
  State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that Max is a spying app are
  false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals
  WhatsApp and Telegram. AFP is reporting that an air raid alert sounded in Kyiv
  during Rutte’s visit to Kyiv. The agency added that: “Russia has stepped up
  drone and missile attacks on Ukraine in recent days as a US-led mediation
  effort to end the three-and-a-half-year war has appeared to falter.” Rutte was
  also asked about whether these new security guarantees would include any
  troops on the ground in Ukraine. He said: “These discussions are now ongoing
  at many levels. So the security advisers are working together. The foreign
  ministers are working together on this. … And it is too early to exactly say
  what will be the outcome, but clearly the US will be involved. Clearly we
  want, do not want, to repeat of the Budapest Memorandum or the Minsk
  agreement, these security guarantees should be holding.” Speaking alongside
  Zelenskyy, Nato’s Rutte said the alliance’s support for Ukraine remained
  “unwavering” and “continues to grow,” with more plans to provide Nato funding
  to ensure “a crucial flow of lethal US weapons to Ukraine.” He lauded the
  outcome of Monday’s talks at the White House, saying that Trump made it clear
  “the United States will indeed be involved in providing security guarantees
  for Ukraine.” He continued: “Robust security guarantees will be essential, and
  this is what we are now working to define, so that when the time comes you for
  you to enter that bilateral meeting, you have the unmistakable force of
  Ukraine’s friends behind you, ensuring that Russia will uphold any deal, and
  will never ever again, attempt to take one square kilometre of Ukraine.” He
  then got challenged by a Ukrainian reporter on how the new guarantees would be
  different from the ones made to Ukraine in the past, including in the 1994
  Budapest Memorandum, that ended up being ignored by Russia. Rutte insisted
  that Europe’s and the US’s active role will make them different this time.
  “The Budapest Memorandum and Minsk did not provide those security guarantees.
  So we clearly know what it should not be, and we are now working together –
  Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States – to make sure that the security
  guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, sitting in
  Moscow, will never, ever try to attack Ukraine again.” Nato secretary general
  Mark Rutte turns out to be in Kyiv today, making a previously unannounced
  visit to Ukraine. We are just getting some lines from his joint appearance at
  a press briefing with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said
  the pair discussed possible security guarantees for Ukraine, insisting they
  should be structured in a similar way to Nato’s core principle in Article 5
  that an attack on one member is an attack on all. The Ukrainian president also
  repeatedly alleged that Russia was trying to make it impossible to end the way
  and to avoid a leaders’ meeting between himself and Putin. We are getting some
  news lines from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, via Reuters, quoting
  a report from the Russian news agency Ria. He is quoted as saying that no
  meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned, but insisting that the Russian
  president remains ready to meet when there’s a ready agenda for their meeting.
  Speaking to NBC TV’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” programme, Lavrov
  also said Russia had agreed to be flexible on a number of points raised by US
  president Donald Trump, Reuters reported. A bilateral meeting between
  President Zelenskyy and Putin is viewed as unlikely and Ukrainians are sure
  that Putin will do everything possible to avoid one. Putin has repeatedly
  questioned Zelenskyy’s legitimacy as president and meeting the Ukrainian
  leader would fly in the face of that stance. But, if we try to imagine how a
  bilateral meeting might go, logically an easy issue should be dealt with first
  – a minor question on which agreement could be achieved, paving the way for
  more difficult topics. But today, between Ukraine and Russia there are no easy
  issues. The exchange of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children
  and civilians from Russia to Ukraine have long been addressed with a degree of
  success by a separate team of employees. All other points for discussion are
  extremely difficult; for example, a mutual ceasefire or a mutual cessation of
  shelling with missiles and drones, or the status of captured territories and
  territories that Russia is still planning to capture. The format of such a
  tete-a-tete meeting is therefore much more likely to be two short monologues,
  but certainly not a dialogue. A three-person meeting with President Trump as a
  moderator could be more productive, but surely Trump will only agree to this
  if he is confident that at least something will be achieved. Otherwise, again,
  as after the Alaska meeting, his reputation will take a beating. Kim Jong-un
  has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine
  as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the
  conflict, state media said on Friday. The North Korean leader said in a speech
  this week that his troops had displayed “fighting spirit of the heroes” during
  their operation to retake Russia’s Kursk region from Ukrainian forces – which
  had established a foothold there last year – the state news agency KCNA said.
  “The combat activities of overseas operational forces … proved without regret
  the power of the heroic [North Korean] army,” Kim said. Kim laid a flower at a
  memorial for North Korean soldiers who had died overseas, while soldiers who
  had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert, KCNA said, adding that
  relatives of troops killed in action had been among those attending a banquet.
  The events were the latest public show of gratitude by the regime in
  Pyongyang, in stark contrast to the secrecy that surrounded North Korea’s role
  in the war when its troops were first sent to Russia last autumn. Kim met
  officers of the army’s overseas operation and paid tribute to North Korean
  soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been assigned to carry out the
  “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant encouragement” to the
  commanders and troops, KCNA said. The ceremony comes days after the Russian
  president, Vladimir Putin, used similar language to pay tribute to North
  Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russian forces. Pyongyang sent more than
  10,000 soldiers to Russia’s Kursk region in 2024, according to South Korean
  and western intelligence agencies, along with artillery shells, missiles and
  long-range rocket systems. About 600 North Korean troops have been killed out
  of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said in April, citing
  the South’s intelligence agency. In the last few minutes, Hungary’s foreign
  minister Szijjártó posted the full letter he sent with his Slovak counterpart
  to the European Commission on gas supplies (10:26). In the letter, the pair
  said: “We regret to inform you that during the last days Ukraine has carried
  out three attacks against the Druzhba oil pipeline which plays a crucial role
  in the energy security of Hungary and Slovakia. These attacks resulted in the
  suspension of oil deliveries to both of our countries. As a consequence of the
  latest missile attack, deliveries seem to be suspended for at least five days.
  The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe
  supply of our countries is simply not possible. Given that in the past years,
  the EU and its Member States have provided hundreds of billions of Euros worth
  of support to Ukraine, we find Ukraine’s actions, which severely threaten the
  energy security of Hungary and Slovakia, completely unacceptable. To this end,
  we strongly call on the Commission to immediately uphold the commitments
  outlined in the above mentioned statement and guarantee the safety of energy
  supply of its Member States.” Let’s see if we get a response from Ukraine this
  morning. French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz
  and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk will visit Moldova next week to
  celebrate Moldova’s independence day, the French president’s office said on
  Friday. “The leaders will reaffirm their full support for Moldova’s security,
  sovereignty and European path,” the Élysée Palace said in a statement,
  reported by Reuters. Moldova, a small former Soviet republic located between
  Ukraine and EU and Nato member Romania, will hold parliamentary elections on
  28 September. The country’s ruling party is seeking to maintain its majority
  and keep its pro-European trajectory intact. Moldovan officials have
  repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in its domestic politics by stoking
  pro-Moscow sentiment in an effort to topple the government as it aims to
  strengthen ties with the West, claims Russia denies, Reuters said. Elsewhere,
  Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to guarantee security of
  supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the Druzbha pipeline
  could be suspended for at least five days following a Ukrainian attack on a
  linked facility in Russia, Reuters reported. “The physical and geographical
  reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is
  simply not possible,” foreign ministers Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár said
  in a joint letter. Slovak pipeline operator Transpetrol said on Friday that
  the flow of oil was interrupted last night, outside the territory of the
  Slovakia. Earlier this week, Szijjártó publicly clashed on this issue with
  Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha, who told him to “send your
  complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow” (Europe live on
  Tuesday). EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Today
  programme earlier today. She asserted that “Russia does not want peace,” as
  she accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of not keeping any promises and
  “just laughing – not stopping the killing, but increase the killing, … the
  bombings on Ukraine.” “You see Europeans, Ukrainians, Americans wanting peace,
  and doing all the diplomatic efforts to achieve that, whereas Russia is just
  dragging feet, it’s clear that Russia does not want peace.” She also called
  for more EU and US sanctions and tariffs against Russia, saying: “It is very
  clear that any promises that Putin has been given so far, he hasn’t kept, and
  we have to treat it as such, but [we] also [have to] make all the efforts in
  really pressuring him to come to the negotiation table. And there we have
  different tools. The Americans have leverage with the sanctions or tariffs to
  pressure Russia into negotiations. We are working on our 19th package of
  sanctions on the European side to really put the pressure on Russia, the one
  who is, who is doing the aggression here.” Kallas also argued that Putin got
  “what he wanted” from the Alaska summit with Trump, getting not just the
  picture with the US president, but “so much more, such a welcome in America,
  and … then he also wanted the sanctions not to be put in place, which he also
  achieved.” “So, I think right now his interest is down, because he has
  achieved what he wanted from this meeting,” she said. She also rejected
  speculations about Ukraine giving up parts of its territory, saying “this is
  exactly the trap that Russia wants us to walk into.” “[They want] the
  discussion [to be] all about what Ukraine should give up, what is the
  concessions that Ukraine is willing to do, whereas we are forgetting that
  Russia hasn’t made one single concession. And they are the ones who are the
  aggressor here. They are the ones who are brutally attacking another country
  and killing people there … So let’s keep the focus there, where we have to
  keep it, to put the pressure on Russia so that they would come to the
  negotiation table. And also, what kind of negotiation concessions are the
  Russians making right now? They have just increased their goals and wishes.”
  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia’s Vladimir Putin of
  “trying to wriggle out of holding a meeting” to discuss peace arrangements,
  saying: “They don’t want to end this war.” Zelenskyy pointed to continuing
  Russian strikes on Ukraine, including on an American company’s facilities in
  Mukachevo, and a growing number of alleged provocations against Nato
  countries, including Lithuania and Poland. “[These are] not accidents –
  Russian impudence,” he said. “We expect our partners to respond in a
  principled manner. This war must be brought to an end. Pressure must be
  exerted on Russia to end the war. Putin understands nothing but force and
  pressure.” He was also quick to pick up on US president Donald Trump’s
  suggestion of more offensive actions. Trump on Thursday appeared to vent his
  frustration at Russia’s obstruction. In a post on Truth Social, the US
  president blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not allowing Ukraine to
  “fight back” against Russia. He said: “It is very hard, if not impossible, to
  win a war without attacking an invaders country. It’s like a great team in
  sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There
  is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and
  grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND.
  How did that work out? … Interesting times ahead!!!” Zelenskyy responded: Of
  course, we will continue doing everything to protect our country and people.
  President Trump is absolutely right—this must be done not only in defense.
  Meanwhile, we do not slow down in diplomacy, so that negotiations to bring
  peace closer can finally take place. Let’s see what today brings. Elsewhere, I
  will be also keeping an eye on the EU’s reactions to the EU-US joint statement
  on trade, and on wildfires affecting Spain and Portugal. I will bring you all
  the key updates here. It’s Friday, 22 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and
  this is Europe Live. Good morning.
