  Eric Adams, the embattled mayor of New York, has denied having conversations
  with Donald Trump about being given a government job in exchange for dropping
  his re-election campaign. Politico reported on Wednesday that Adams has been
  offered a position at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development,
  citing a person with direct knowledge of the offer. The mayor met with the
  president’s team during his visit to Florida on Monday, according to the
  person. The New York Times also reported that advisers to Donald Trump “have
  discussed the possibility” of giving Adams a position in an attempt to thwart
  the political ambitions of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old Democratic
  socialist who is currently the frontrunner to be elected mayor in November.
  According to the Times, “intermediaries” for Trump have spoken to “associates”
  of Adams about leaving the race. Adams, who has proved to be deeply unpopular
  among New York Democratic voters and is running as an independent candidate,
  is trailing Mamdani in the polls, and is draining support from former New York
  governor Andrew Cuomo, also running as an independent. There is a suggestion
  that if Adams, a centrist Democrat, and the Republican candidate, Curtis
  Sliwa, were to drop out of the race, Cuomo could consolidate enough support to
  challenge Mamdani. The New York Times reported that there have been talks in
  the Trump administration about also finding a job for Sliwa to get him out of
  the race. “Mayor Adams has made it clear that he will not respond to every
  rumor that comes up,” said Todd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams, told the
  Guardian. “He has had no discussions with, nor has he met with, President
  Donald Trump regarding the mayoral race. The mayor is fully committed to
  winning this election, with millions of New Yorkers preparing to cast their
  votes. “His record is clear: crime is down, jobs are up, and he has
  consistently stood up for working families. Mayor Adams is focused on building
  on that progress and earning four more years to continue delivering for the
  people of New York.” Sliwa told Politico he had not spoken to the White House
  and would not want a job anyway. “I have not been contacted by the White
  House, and I’m not interested in a job with the White House,” he said in a
  statement. “My focus is right here in New York. I’m the only candidate on a
  major party line who can defeat Mamdani, and I’m committed to carrying this
  fight through to election day. The people of New York City deserve a mayor who
  truly cares.” Mamdani, meanwhile, has been keen to underline his rivals’
  associations with Trump, who is deeply unpopular in true-blue New York City.
  “Today’s news confirms it: Cuomo is Trump’s choice for Mayor. The White House
  is considering jobs for Adams and Sliwa to clear the field,” he wrote on X.
  “New Yorkers are sick of corrupt politics and backroom deals. No matter who’s
  running, we will deliver a better future on November 4.” On Tuesday a poll
  found Adams with 9% of the vote in the election – Mamdani was at 42%, Cuomo
  26% and Sliwa 17%.
