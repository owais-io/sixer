  If dodging swooping gulls trying to steal your chips wasn’t already enough,
  you might be spending your bank holiday trying to keep wasps away from your
  ice cream too. Britain is in the middle of a wasp boom. Not only have they
  arrived earlier than expected, but there are more of them than in recent
  summers. Experts say 2025 is an excellent year for them. Populations have
  soared across the UK thanks to an unusually warm and dry spring. The UK had
  its warmest spring for mean temperature on record, according to the Met
  Office. Cooler, wetter springs help keep wasp numbers regulated by wiping out
  young worker colonies before they can establish themselves. But not this year.
  With ideal conditions, more queens survived to establish nests, leading to the
  early appearance of significantly larger colonies. “The warm, dry conditions
  have created the ideal environment for wasps to thrive,” says Prof Seirian
  Sumner, a behavioural ecologist at University College London that and author
  of Endless Forms: Why We Should Love Wasps. “That means more colonies, more
  wasps and a longer season.” Wasps don’t usually cause picnic chaos until late
  August, when they begin craving sugar, Sumner said, but the extended warm
  weather means they are already here. At the start of the season, wasps are on
  the lookout for protein to take back to their nests, usually other insects
  such as flies and caterpillars. This is not ideal if you are munching on a
  scotch egg, but it’s great for the environment, she said. Wasps are natural
  pest controllers, and play a key role in regulating insect populations. As the
  summer goes on, their preferences shift. Once the larvae are fed and the
  colonies mature, adult wasps begin hunting for sugar instead. Their narrow
  waists make them less able to digest solid food, so they gravitate towards
  convenient liquids, which is when sweet drinks and ice creams become prime
  targets. Alcohol, in particular, appears to be a magnet. “Volatile compounds
  released by drinks like cider, beer and wine are highly attractive to wasps,”
  said Dr Tilly Collins, a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and
  researcher at Imperial College London. Despite their bad reputation, wasps are
  crucial to our ecosystem. As well as their role in pest control, they are
  vital pollinators. After decades of declining insect numbers, their return
  this year is a promising sign that experts welcome. So what should you do when
  one circles your sandwich? Andrew Whitehouse from the charity Buglife charity,
  which is devoted to the conservation of invertebrates, said: “Don’t swat, and
  definitely don’t panic. Stay calm and move your arms in a slow and controlled
  manner. They should get the message.” Sumner, who carries out a Ham or Jam?
  survey that tracks wasp behaviour suggests a sacrificial morsel: “Place a
  wasp-friendly, small portion of food a short distance away. Wasps are
  opportunists, and usually happy to accept a better offer.”
