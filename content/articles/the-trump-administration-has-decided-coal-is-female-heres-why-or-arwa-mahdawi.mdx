  Have you ever tossed and turned at night wondering what the correct pronouns
  are for a lump of coal? No, me neither. However, it seems someone at the US
  Department of Energy has devoted a few spare brain cells to this matter and
  decided that coal is a she/her. Co-opting a phrase adopted by the LGBTQ+
  community, the official energy department X account tweeted on 31 July: “She’s
  an icon. She’s a legend. And she is the moment,” alongside a sparkling picture
  of coal. This comes as the Trump administration devotes considerable energy to
  making fossil fuels great again. The president has signed numerous executive
  orders aimed at “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” and
  reversed Biden-era pollution regulations on coal-fired power plants. These
  plants, according to a 2023 report, killed at least 460,000 Americans over the
  past two decades. Deaths declined when the environmental regulations that
  Donald Trump is so scornful of were put in place. Why is the Trump
  administration, which seems to think women are objects, so keen on
  personifying coal? Is it for poetic effect? Or are they trying to sanitise the
  deadly impact of coal pollution and associate it with mother nature? I suspect
  the second motive. Ships, for example, have traditionally been referred to as
  “she”, possibly because sailors saw them as a maternal protector. Countries
  can also be classified as female – particularly when a man thinks their
  violent actions need to be defended. In 2023, shortly after the 7 October
  attacks, at a time when Gaza was being bombed and blockaded by Israel, Keir
  Starmer said Israel had “the right to defend herself”. Then again, sometimes
  the short answer to why things are unnecessarily gendered is simply “lazy
  sexism”. For a long time, Atlantic hurricanes were given only female names.
  When feminists started to challenge this in the 1980s, some people argued that
  storms would be taken seriously only if they evoked female fury. Years after
  meteorologists finally changed the policy, a 1986 Washington Post editorial
  lamented: “Somehow many of the male names don’t convey either the romance or
  the urgency that circumstances might warrant.” This has been much debated and
  it’s not clear whether gendering a storm makes any difference to public
  safety. As for the weird social media post gendering coal? It feels like a
  smokescreen to get people chattering online as the world burns. • Arwa Mahdawi
