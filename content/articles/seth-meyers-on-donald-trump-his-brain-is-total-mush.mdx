  Late-night hosts respond to Donald Trump’s rooftop press conference and other
  distractions from Texas Republicans’ attempt to rig the midterm elections.
  Seth Meyers “Texas Republicans have caused a national uproar with their plan
  to rig the 2026 midterms by redrawing their congressional maps,” said Seth
  Meyers on Wednesday’s Late Night. “Also, the president was seen wandering
  around on the roof of the White House. And therein lies the constant tension
  of the Trump era: Republicans doing something nefarious that will undermine
  democracy, while the president does something weird and dumb that distracts
  us.” “And it’s not like you can ignore it,” he added. “If the president pops
  up on the roof of the White House, out of nowhere, that’s at least worth a
  mention on the news. I mean, if Obama had been caught climbing out a window in
  the middle of the night, I’m pretty sure Fox News would’ve covered it.” All in
  all: “Too much is happening, and it’s impossible for our brains to absorb all
  of it.” Meyers started with Trump’s rooftop conference on Tuesday. “OK, what,
  and I mean this as exhaustedly as possible, the fuck?” he wondered. “This
  looks like one of those human interest stories where firefighters have to
  rescue a dog that got stuck on the roof.” Meyers theorized that Trump, with
  his approval rating now at an all-time low, went on the roof because “he can’t
  answer your questions if he can’t hear them. If his poll numbers get any
  worse, he’s going to start doing press conferences on top of the Washington
  monument.” Thankfully, “a crew of firefighters did eventually lure the
  president down from the roof with a Big Mac on a string”, Meyers joked. Later
  in the day, the president attended an event about the 2028 Olympics in
  California. “And if you thought wandering around on the roof might be a
  warning sign about his mental competency, his rant about California wildfires
  made clear: his brain is total mush.” Trump’s rant mentioned the Pacific
  Ocean, a tiny fish called the “smelt”, the Pacific north-west releasing the
  “full complement of water” to California and, of course, Gavin Newsom.
  (Contrary to what Trump implied, there is no water supply from the Pacific
  north-west that connects to California.) “What does he mean?” Meyers wondered,
  before proposing his theory: “Trump thinks water flows from the north to the
  south … In Trump’s mind, the north part of the state is literally higher up in
  the air than the south.” It’s a theory that tracks with Trump’s general
  understanding of the world. Or, as Meyers put it, “he doesn’t understand
  gravity or, like, maps”. Stephen Colbert “I know that Trump’s followers get a
  lot of grief from people going, ‘Oh, you don’t believe in anything, it’s a
  cult of personality, blah blah blah,’” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show.
  “But I want to be fair here – there is one thing that Maga has believed from
  the beginning and they still believe it. And that’s that there is a secret
  cabal of top government officials who meet at shadowy dinners to strategize
  how to hide the sins of wealthy sex traffickers and pedophiles. “They do
  believe that, and for that, I have never criticized them,” he continued.
  “Because I’m sure that kind of stuff does go on. For instance, tonight in
  Washington,” where top Trump officials gathered to discuss the president’s
  strategy for handling the scandal over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, at
  a dinner hosted by JD Vance. “Now look, many things are shocking about that
  headline,” said Colbert. “First of all, this Epstein crisis has made Trump
  officials so desperate, they’re willing to hang out with JD Vance.” In
  addition to Vance, the dinner reportedly included the White House chief of
  staff, Susie Wiles; the US attorney general, Pam Bondi; the deputy attorney
  general, Todd Blanche; and the FBI director, Kash Patel. CNN was the first to
  report the meeting, which Vance’s office then denied. “Now they’re covering up
  the cover-up!” Colbert fumed. “This is worse than a conspiracy. It’s a duvet.”
  “Dinner or no dinner, the Eyes Wide Shut supper still has to decide what to do
  with the transcript of the Ghislaine Maxwell interview,” Colbert continued.
  Ever since Blanche met with Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence for
  sex-trafficking minors, the justice department has been digitizing,
  transcribing and redacting the interview materials. “Oh, I bet they have!”
  Colbert laughed. “‘Let’s see, control-F, find Donald Trump … replace with
  Gayle King.’ “As they redacted the truth into a shallow grave,” he added,
  Trump officials are considering releasing the interview, although they’re
  reportedly concerned that making details of it public would bring the Epstein
  controversy back to the surface. “Back to the surface?!” Colbert laughed.
  “It’s way above the surface, man! This controversy is all the way up on the
  roof!” “Everything about this story is as shady as a cave,” he concluded.
  Maxwell was transferred to a cushier prison in Texas, and now sources are
  saying that she told the justice department that Trump never did anything
  concerning around her. “Well, he’s in the clear!” Colbert mocked. “Good work,
  gentleman! I know we all had our suspicions, but the convicted sex trafficker
  of underage girls didn’t see anything that concerned her. No red flags for
  Ghislaine during her decade-long career of underage sex trafficking. She said
  right here in the transcript: ‘What was Donald Trump doing with Jeffrey
  Epstein? Nothing that concerned me, Ghislaine Maxwell, sex trafficker. I
  would’ve done what he did. Well, back to my normal non-concerning workaday
  grindstone … of sex trafficking.’”
