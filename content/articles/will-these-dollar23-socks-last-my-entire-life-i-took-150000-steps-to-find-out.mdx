  For the first three decades of my life, I rode the nice-shoes-cheap-socks
  train. Then it happened. Returning from a friend’s house, I discovered there
  was a hole in the ankle of one of my socks. My mind flooded with questions.
  Mostly, did anyone notice the back of my ankle exposed like Achilles at Troy?
  My research to avoid this ever happening again led me to Darn Tough Socks. The
  Vermont company’s offer of an unconditional lifetime guarantee caught my eye.
  If they wear out, they’ll ship you another pair for free. That was enough to
  help me overcome my trepidation of paying $23 for a pair of socks, over 10
  times what I normally pay. I settled on the Quarter Midweight Hiking Socks. So
  far I’ve taken over 150,000 steps in this pair, and I’ve reached a decision: I
  plan to take many, many more. $23 at Darn Tough $22.95 at Amazon What I love
  One of the reasons I get holes in my socks is a headline that said getting at
  least 8,000 steps a day halved mortality from all causes. I’m now an avid
  walker and average around 7,000-10,000 steps a day. As I’ve found, these socks
  have excellent insulation. I live in New England, so I’ve worn my socks in
  temperatures ranging from 50F to 102F. The merino wool and nylon blend did the
  job of keeping my feet in the Goldilocks Zone and wicking away sweat. I also
  appreciated the construction. The toebox is seamless and stretchy, allowing
  for proper toe splay. The foot is cushioned. The combination leads to less
  soreness. And I’m certain that Darn Tough Socks are more durable than socks
  you’ve previously owned for two reasons. First, one of my quarter-length socks
  tips the scales at 34 grams compared to 25 grams for a quarter-length from
  Fruit of Loom. (I weighed them both.) The extra density in the weave means the
  sock is more resistant to tearing and wear. Second, when I received my pair in
  the mail, I immediately started poking them with a flathead screwdriver and
  trying to tear them apart with my bare hands. These socks withstood it all. I
  haven’t had to return a pair to Darn Tough to test their replacement promise,
  but the Guardian’s Filter US editor Nick Mokey has done so in the past, and
  has another return in the works. “There are no questions asked, and really no
  catches,” he says. “You pay to ship them out, Darn Tough pays for the return.”
  I also reached out to Darn Tough to find out more, and the company replied
  that while it can’t share the exact number of socks it has replaced, it has
  exchanged pairs from customers that have passed through golden retrievers,
  summited Everest and survived wildfires in California. The company says it
  benefits from offering free replacements because it gets direct feedback from
  consumers and data on how to improve the design, and it shows a clear
  commitment to quality control. Verdict Darn Tough socks are an investment.
  It’s the type of product that you buy once, quite literally with a lifetime
  guarantee. If you’re on your feet all day, you’ll find them an upgrade over
  socks that are sold in bulk. People who wear socks in lieu of slippers would
  enjoy them because they provide cushioning while also being comfortable to
  wear in both hot and cold weather. I know the holidays are some time away –
  but Darn Tough Socks would make a great stocking stuffer. Socks within socks,
  imagine that. Specifications Type: Quarter-length Materials: 59% Merino Wool,
  38% Nylon, 3% Lycra Spandex Care instructions: Machine wash Available colors:
