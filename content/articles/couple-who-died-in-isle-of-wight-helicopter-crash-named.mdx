  A couple who died in a helicopter crash during the bank holiday on the Isle of
  Wight have been named by relatives. Justyna Czoska, 52, a horse riding
  instructor, and her partner, Wojtek Kowalkowski, 49, from Bloxham,
  Oxfordshire, died after the aircraft crash-landed at about 9.24am on Monday
  between Shanklin and Whiteley Bank. The helicopter had taken off from Sandown
  airport 20 minutes earlier. Another person was also killed, while a fourth was
  taken to hospital and is said to be in a serious condition. The helicopter
  ride had reportedly been a birthday present for Kowalkowski. A GoFundMe post
  written by Jacob Butler, the partner of Czoska’s daughter, Julia Buzar, 22,
  read: “On August 25th, my partner’s beloved mum and her partner tragically
  lost their lives in a helicopter crash on the Isle of Wight. This sudden and
  devastating event has left all us heartbroken and struggling to cope with the
  loss. “We are now trying to bring them both back to Poland so they can be laid
  to rest with their families, in the place they called home. The cost of
  repatriation, funeral arrangements and travel is more than we can manage
  alone, and we are asking for support during this incredibly difficult time.
  “Any donation, no matter how small, will help us give them the farewell they
  deserve. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your kindness, support,
  and for keeping our family in your thoughts. With love, Jacob and Julia.”
  Posting on Facebook, Buzar said: “I have no words, the world took my mum too
  soon, she was the best mum you could ask for, loved by everyone. “I never
  thought I’d be writing something like this. Please, if anyone could help bring
  them back to Poland so they can be with their families it would mean the world
  to me … Rest in peace mum and Wojtek.” The Air Accidents Investigation Branch
  has launched a formal inquiry into the crash. Northumbria Helicopters, a firm
  based at Newcastle airport, has confirmed one of its helicopters was involved.
