  mindful, active watching is Weerasethakul’s goalI’ve always carried a deep
  sense of gratitude for my ability to speak more than one language. It has
  allowed me to build bridges across cultures, to connect with people from
  vastly different walks of life and to find a sense of belonging wherever I’ve
  been: Australia, Germany, Pakistan or Afghanistan. Each language I’ve learned
  has brought with it a new lens through which to view the world. But nothing
  has stirred my soul quite like Persian – the language of mystics and lovers.
  My journey into the Persian language felt less like consciously acquiring a
  new skill and more like unlocking a secret passage inside myself. It has
  opened doors not just to new ideas and ways of thinking but to the deepest
  emotions. For the first time, I’ve found a language that doesn’t just help me
  navigate time and space in mere practical terms but helps me to express and
  feel every moment beyond that. My journey with Persian began a couple of years
  ago, with some naive assumptions and fake smiles when Persian-speaking Afghans
  cracked jokes. I was new in Kabul, following years of wandering in
  neighbouring Pakistan and then later in Europe. I had no idea about this
  second national language of the country – mine was Pashtu. I have been
  fascinated with the Persian language since learning it in an entirely natural
  way – just by talking to friends, through music, movies and poetry. It is the
  cultural elegance so woven into the language and its abundance of rich
  emotional expressions that make it unique. For instance, consider “Nosh-e
  jaan” (May it nourish you) said to someone eating food, or “Gul Gufti” (Your
  words are beautiful like roses). There’s also “Del-at shad bashad” (May your
  heart be joyful) or “Khak-e paye tu-am” (I am the dust beneath your feet),
  used to show respect to and love of elders or teachers. These may sound
  bizarrely formal, but they are everyday staples in Persian. From its greetings
  to the haunting depth of its classical verse, Persian is rich with rhythm,
  subtlety and emotional nuance. It is a language that carries music in its tone
  and wisdom from the music of Bollywood to the mountains of Afghanistan to the
  valleys of Iran, orchids of central Asia and as far as the gates of Europe in
  Turkey. Even the most ordinary phrases seem to hum with history and feeling.
  It’s as if every word carries a centuries-old heartbeat. In Persian I’ve
  discovered expressions for emotions I had long felt but could never
  articulate. I’ve found metaphors that mirror my own journey, phrases that feel
  like home and poetry that speaks directly to the soul. It’s more than a means
  of communication – it’s a new way of being, of loving, of remembering and of
  dreaming. My romance with Persian began when Afghanistan’s Pashtu speakers
  were pushing to reclaim status and space for their language in a country with
  a deep-rooted Afghan dialect, Dari, which has long been used in almost all
  official communications. For me, the politics of it hardly mattered. I had
  learned Pashtu at home from my sweet mum and loved it as my inner core
  language, before learning my second language, Urdu/Hindi, then English and
  Punjabi during my years in Pakistan’s biggest and most diverse metropolis,
  Karachi. I learned German when I went to work at that country’s public
  broadcaster Deutsche Welle in Bonn. English, perhaps the most professionally
  transformative of the languages I speak, is the language I write in, but it
  remains a bit foreign and a bit distant. Like a guest who had overstayed but
  never fully moved in. Persian was not a language I learned; it was one that
  absorbed me. Unlike the others, Persian didn’t just expand my vocabulary – it
  rewired my emotions. It cracked open an interior world I hadn’t known how to
  access. It wasn’t about fluency – it was about awakening. It is a language
  that doesn’t shy away from feeling. It doesn’t rush towards meaning or neat
  endings; it lingers. In Persian even pain is a form of grace. You don’t just
  say you’re missing someone, you say “Dil-tangetam” “My heart is constricted
  because of you”. “Safa avordi” (You brought good energy/joy with you), is
  often said when a guest visits. For me, someone who wasn’t lucky enough to
  spend hours reading Persian books when I stayed in Kabul, it is delightful to
  see how convenient it is to access the Persian maestro, Afghanistan-born Jalal
  al-Din Balkhi or Mawlana or Rumi as he is known around the world. He is like
  the god of Persian language for me. I remember the moment I first read this
  line by Rumi in its original form: Asheq sho, gar na ruzi kar-e jahan sar ayad
  – Nakhande naqsh-e maqsud az kargah-e hasti. Fall in love, or someday the work
  of the world will end – And you’ll leave this workshop of being without having
  seen its purpose. Somewhere in this journey of learning Persian, I felt its
  role in overcoming the noise of modern urgency. There’s a word in Persian –
  delneshin – that means something that sits sweetly on the heart. That’s what
  Persian has become for me. A quiet, enduring echo. • Shadi Khan Saif is an
