  Essie Davis didn’t watch much horror growing up in Tasmania; the 55-year-old
  actor can still bitterly recall the moment when, aged four, she was left at
  home while her older siblings went to see Jaws at the local cinema in Hobart.
  “I stood by the back door going, ‘I will remember this day for the rest of my
  life!’” Davis recalls, speaking from her current family home, also in
  Tasmania. She finally saw the film on VHS years later, while dating a
  production designer she had met while performing at Belvoir St theatre. That
  designer was Justin Kurzel, now one of Australia’s most celebrated directors –
  and also her husband. Back in the mid-90s, Kurzel’s courtship rituals included
  a crash course in horror classics – Jaws was high on the list, followed
  closely by Ridley Scott’s 1979 space slasher Alien. “I love that first Alien
  film so much, I wish I’d seen it in a cinema,” Davis says. “They’re definitely
  a huge part of my film psyche.” It would take another few decades before Davis
  entered the Alien universe herself, in a new prequel series set shortly before
  the original film. Alien: Earth focuses on Wendy (Sydney Chandler), a “forever
  girl” whose consciousness is transferred from her terminally ill human body to
  a synthetic one, making her a world-first “hybrid”. Davis plays Dame Sylvia,
  one of the scientists responsible for Wendy’s second life. In one of many
  allusions to Peter Pan, Hawley named the character after Sylvia Llewelyn
  Davies, the real-life mother of the boys who inspired JM Barrie to write his
  Neverland saga. The show’s themes – and Sylvia’s attempts to balance Wendy’s
  humanity with her new, artificial immortality – felt particularly timely to
  Davis. “AI was a thing that was coming, but it wasn’t suddenly upon us,” she
  says. “And then we had the writers’ strike and the actors’ strike, and then
  ChatGPT suddenly was in the schools in Tasmania, and I was just going, ‘hang
  on a minute’. “There’s a tightrope of ethics and morality, and everyone has a
  different version of it. I really hope that people will enjoy this and get
  hooked into that quandary of genetic engineering and ethics and that strange
  quest to own everything and beat everyone and be younger than anyone.” Davis
  is a horror icon herself, thanks to a breakout role in Jennifer Kent’s 2014
  film The Babadook. The low-budget Australian production became a global hit,
  with fans including The Exorcist director William Friedkin, who placed the
  film alongside Alien as one of the scariest films he had ever seen. It remains
  a modern cult classic 10 years later. “I remember watching a screening way
  before it was released, and just went, ‘Oh, this is great, but it’s not
  scary’,” she says. “And then we went to the Sundance film festival, and I sat
  up the back as people swore and leapt out of their seats.” Davis credits the
  film’s enduring appeal – its top-hatted spook has even been embraced as an
  unlikely Queer icon – to something deeper than jump scares. “It’s not just a
  horror film,” she says. “It’s in fact a kind of psychological thriller about
  mental health and grief and parenting and love.” It remains a defining role
  for Davis, alongside her star turn in Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries – the
  1920s detective franchise that ran for three series and a film, based on the
  novels of Kerry Greenwood, who died in April. “A terrible loss, but she’s
  forever in us now,” says Davis. “I was crying, working out whether I should do
  it or not,” she adds, of donning Phryne Fisher’s signature black bob. “I’m
  really glad I did, because that character was such a positive force, and it’s
  just so fun to play someone so clever and positive and naughty and irreverent
  – and someone who really cares about social justice, and is not going to bow
  for anyone, and stands up for the underdog.” Along with roles in Game of
  Thrones, Baby Teeth and Netflix’s One Day, Davis has also collaborated with
  her film-maker husband, responsible for films including Snowtown, Nitram, and
  television adaptations of Peter Carey’s The True History of the Kelly Gang and
  most recently Richard Flanagan’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North. Davis
  appeared in the latter three. Their kids were old enough to be watching Alien
  for a high school English class when the script for Alien: Earth hit Davis’s
  inbox; the series is led by Noah Hawley, the showrunner behind the
  award-winning small-screen adaptation of Fargo. She was intrigued; the show’s
  depiction of a future Earth carved up and controlled by mega-corporations –
  Dame Sylvia is employed by Prodigy, a rival to the franchise’s longstanding
  faceless villains, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation – particularly resonated
  with her. “It’s terribly prescient – the richest of corporations and the
  richest people taking over the world, essentially running the world,” she
  says. For Davis, the perils of corporate profits have been plain to see from
  her home in Tasmania, where she and Kurzel returned to raise their family. “It
  is terrifying what is happening to our beautiful place here in Tassie, and the
  total corporate capture of our government by big industry,” she says of the
  controversy around the state’s fish farming industry, of which she has become
  one of many high-profile critics, alongside Richard Flanagan and former ABC
  journalist turned political candidate Peter George. These days, Davis doesn’t
  have to go to the cinema to witness coastal dread. “When you look out over the
  water from Bruny Island, everywhere you look you see rows and rows of fish
  pens, and huge, industrial factory ships,” she says. “We had mass fish
  mortalities, rotting salmon washing up on our beaches. And 53 cormorants got
  shot because they were fishing out of the pens.” Davis says the public
  opposition to such practices “began as lots of individuals around Tasmania
  making constructive criticism, and asking for a bit of negotiation on
  pollution”. It was being ignored by salmon companies and successive
  governments, she says, that connected and galvanised the far-flung island
  community. What began as a movement, Davis says, has now become an
  “insurrection”, evident in the rise of Peter George, who was elected to
  Tasmania’s state parliament as an independent days after our interview. “But
  we’re not going to stop,” she says. “We’re just going to keep on until we have
  people representing the people of Tasmania and not just corporations and party
  politics. “I guess Alien is a warning, isn’t it?” she adds. “A warning of what
  greed and money and this kind of pursuit of immortality can do to a planet.” •
