  The chief executive of the UK’s leading artificial intelligence institute is
  stepping down after a staff revolt and government calls for a strategic
  overhaul. Jean Innes has led the Alan Turing Institute since 2023, but her
  position has come under pressure amid widespread discontent within the
  organisation and a demand from the institute’s biggest funder, the UK
  government, for a change in direction. ATI said the search was already under
  way for a replacement for Innes, who held senior roles in the civil service
  and technology industry before her appointment. Innes said on Thursday: “It
  has been a great honour to lead the UK’s national institute for data science
  and artificial intelligence, implementing a new strategy and overseeing
  significant organisational transformation. With that work concluding, and a
  new chapter starting for the Institute, now is the right time for new
  leadership and I am excited about what it will achieve.” ATI has been beset by
  internal strife since last year as staff protested against internal changes,
  culminating in a group of employees filing a whistleblower complaint to the
  Charity Commission last month.
