  Yvonne Miller was beside herself with grief when her 23-year-old son,
  Christopher B Kelly, died from gun violence in August 2020. She connected with
  the Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative, a Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, mental
  health non-profit, and executive director Karen Crawford Simms soon showed up
  at her door to help her process her trauma. Every week, Simms encouraged
  Miller to cherish the memories of her son and offered her a space to cry. At
  Simms’s suggestion, Miller kept a diary in which she documented the ebb and
  flow of denial and anger. Through in-person and virtual sessions with Simms,
  Miller climbed her way out of the initial stages of grief. In 2023, she even
  created a weekly support group for mothers in the metropolitan area who have
  lost their children to gun violence, “because nobody knows what we’re going
  through”, Miller said, “except us”. But the neighbor-to-neighbor counseling,
  which helped Miller cope, is no more. The non-profit’s funding from the
  American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa), a Biden-era stimulus bill, ran out. And the
  organization had to end its crisis support for gun-violence survivors in July.
  Before then, Simms and her team had offered a free 40-hour training program to
  community members in areas with gun violence, as well as to providers who work
  with people experiencing homelessness, formerly incarcerated people and
  religious congregation members. From the non-profit’s founding in 2019 until
  funding recently ran out, Simms and her team trained more than 500 people in
  Champaign-Urbana. If the Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative can’t find other
  grants, it may close in December. Its potential closure mirrors the fate of
  other organizations nationwide that focus on community violence and also rely
  on Arpa funds that will expire by the end of 2026. And now, under the Trump
  administration, there are even fewer federal resources for such programs. In
  April, the Department of Justice’s office of justice programs canceled 373
  grants totaling about $500m. Some of that amount went toward violence
  reduction, according to a recent report from the non-profit Council on
  Criminal Justice. “Arpa was really a gamechanger for the community violence
  intervention and prevention field,” said Nick Wilson, senior director for gun
  violence prevention at the Center for American Progress, in Governing
  magazine. “Arpa was really a chance for cities to really experiment and scale
  up existing programs, and especially for a lot of places, we saw new programs
  being started.” The sunset of Arpa funding and additional cuts come as gun
  violence killed 128 people a day in 2023 throughout the nation, according to
  the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. While a
  decrease from the previous two years, the death toll is the third highest on
  record since 1968. As the Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative’s board searches
  for grants, Simms is offering additional training to residents so that the
  non-profit’s work will continue to live on despite its potential closure.
  Simms and her mental health specialist volunteers still offer support groups
  for children, teens and adults to process traumatic experiences. They also
  provide stress management support for individuals, families and providers who
  work with populations facing adversity. And they train community leaders on
  how to support immigrants and refugees if their families are torn apart or if
  they fear immigration raids. Starting in the fall, they hope to offer training
  to organizations and survivors of community trauma, including gun violence and
  natural disasters – if the initiative stays open. Simms is hopeful that the
  Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative will be saved if Congress passes a recently
  introduced House bill that would direct the US Department of Health and Human
  Services to fund community-based resilience and mental health programs. The
  Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative seeks to offer an alternative to policing
  and focuses on addressing the roots of violence in the Black community, often
  home to “the individuals most impacted by gun violence”, Simms said. To reduce
  overpolicing in their neighborhoods, Simms said that responders often call
  organizers who focus on averting violence instead of contacting law
  enforcement. “Our goal is to de-escalate things for the communities that we
  work with and serve,” Simms said. “From a brain perspective, law enforcement
  can be triggering. And so once your amygdala is activated, we think that it
  probably would make the situation worse, and we’d prefer to step away, or give
  you a minute.” The initiative’s training aims to interrupt gun violence by
  helping community responders identify signs of distress and increase problem
  solving skills through roleplaying, visualization and writing exercises.
  “Particularly when we’re thinking about neighborhoods that have been impacted
  by structural inequality and community violence, we want to make sure that
  there are feelings of safety,” Simms said, “that you’re from the neighborhood,
  you are trusted by the neighborhood.” Simms’s work and the city’s efforts to
  prevent and intervene in gun violence may have helped reduce shootings in
  Champaign in recent years. The number of deaths by gunfire declined by more
  than 68% between 2021 and 2024, from 16 to five, respectively, according to
  Champaign police department data reported by WCIA. “We want to improve our
  community’s capacity to take care of its own,” Simms said. “We want it to
  democratize health and healing, so that the community has the tools, and we
  don’t have to professionalize trauma healing.” ‘There is a future’ Even before
  Arpa funding encouraged city leaders throughout the nation to launch violence
  prevention programs after the Covid-19 pandemic, community members in
  Champaign-Urbana were focused on bringing a trauma-informed care model to the
  area. Trauma-informed care recognizes that violence and other adverse
  experiences affect people’s coping strategies and development. Taking that
  into account, practitioners seek to foster safety and resilience. The
  framework originally began in the 1960s and 1970s, and has now been adopted by
  cities, businesses and schools throughout the nation. The model came to
  Champaign-Urbana by way of tragedy. When 15-year-old Kiwane Carrington was
  shot and killed by Champaign police in 2009, community members resolved to
  address violence by tackling trauma. That eventually led Champaign county’s
  mental health board to fund a community group that trained residents to
  provide neighbor-to-neighbor counseling. The community group then convinced
  Simms to found the Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative in 2019. In recent
  years, most of the non-profit’s funding – $900,000 – came from Arpa funds,
  which allowed the organization to pay for Black therapists to receive
  trauma-informed certifications. “If we’re going to change the infrastructure,”
  Simms said, “we have to change the workforce.” Over the years, the
  initiative’s free programming grew from providing grief support for families
  who experienced gun violence to offering wraparound services by connecting
  clients with organizations that helped them find housing, jobs and healthcare.
  Before funds dried up, organizations such as homeless shelters, refugee
  resettlement offices, re-entry programs and law enforcement agencies gave the
  non-profit’s phone number to residents in need of help, Simms said, and about
  a quarter of references came from word of mouth. Paid mental health providers
  were available to answer calls 24/7. Since they’re from a smaller community,
  responders sometimes drove to a person’s location to talk to them face to
  face. “Rather than having to wait until a therapist appointment, you can have
  somebody who can meet with the people in their homes, at McDonald’s, at the
  library – wherever makes sense,” Simms said. “People pull over and sit in
  their car and talk, and my team is there for you when you need them, texting
  you tools, reminding you of those tools.” Earlier this year, hospital staff
  called the hotline when a patient was discharged and was unable to return to
  their home due to tension in the household. So the Trauma &amp; Resilience
  Initiative called upon trained volunteers to meet with the person in the
  non-profit’s office, where they also supplied food. The volunteers helped
  de-escalate the situation by calming the person down and collaborating with
  another local organization to provide the person with a hotel room. “That’s
  the beautiful thing about having a community-based approach, is we can be
  pretty flexible,” Simms said. “And we see ourselves as a part of a team, a
  network of people in the community.” James Corbin works as a peer mentor and
  drop-in center coordinator at the non-profit FirstFollowers, which helps
  formerly incarcerated people find work and housing. Corbin has attended
  several training sessions from the Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative, which
  he said that he’s used to help hundreds of people in various situations.
  Through the training, he learned how to identify when someone is in a trauma
  response. He established trust with the population that he served by sharing
  his own experience of being incarcerated and becoming paralyzed from gun
  violence. Three years ago, he responded to a call from a formerly incarcerated
  person who was also in a wheelchair and was considering hurting himself.
  Corbin talked the man down by sharing his personal story and reminding him
  what made his life worth living. “I got into his head, into his mind, and I
  understand where he’s at. He’s at a high anxiety level. He don’t see a
  future,” Corbin said. “Part of that training is: ‘There is a future. You can
  do this.’” If the Trauma &amp; Resilience Initiative can raise money, Simms
  hopes to offer stipends and additional training to volunteers so
  neighbor-to-neighbor counseling can continue regardless of the organization’s
  future.
