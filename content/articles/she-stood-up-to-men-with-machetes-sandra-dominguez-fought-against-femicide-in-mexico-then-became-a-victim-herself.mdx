  On 4 October 2024, as a storm lashed the town of María Lombardo de Caso, in
  the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, Sandra Domínguez stopped answering her
  family’s messages. After three days, Kisha Domínguez, her sister, knew
  something was wrong. She made the eight-hour car journey with their mother,
  Aracely Martínez Villanueva, from the city of Oaxaca. When they arrived, they
  found Sandra’s home empty, her car abandoned. Her husband had also
  disappeared. Six months later, on 24 April, their bodies were found on a ranch
  21 miles from María Lombardo. Sandra and her husband, Alexander Hernández,
  might have gone down as two more victims of the violence that grips Mexico,
  where roughly 30,000 people are murdered each year. But this time the case
  shot to national attention. Sandra was a feminist activist, known for helping
  the families of disappeared women and for twice rocking the political
  establishment in Oaxaca by denouncing powerful men involved in misogynistic
  WhatsApp groups. The uproar over her disappearance seemed to spur the
  investigation, leading to the discovery of the bodies – an exception in a
  country where most who disappear are never found. Yet, who murdered the couple
  – and why – remains unclear. Authorities claim Sandra was “collateral damage”
  in a conflict between criminal groups. Her family, who now take care of her
  teenage daughter, believe her murder was tied to her activism. *** Sandra was
  born in San Isidro Huayápam, an Indigenous Mixe community in Oaxaca. She
  studied law at university, before founding the Liberal Union of Oaxacan Women,
  an association to promote women’s rights. She spent time encouraging women
  from Mixe communities (also known as the Ayuuk), many of whom are relatively
  poor and marginalised, to get into politics. She also rescued women from
  domestic abuse. “Sandra was a pioneer, a woman who stood up to men with
  machetes,” says a friend, who asked to remain anonymous for their safety. “The
  authorities don’t get involved in such things: they say they are marital
  problems. She always said we had to be fearless.” Sandra’s activism sometimes
  set her against local, male-dominated political power structures. In 2020, she
  confronted them head on. When she found out about a misogynistic WhatsApp
  group in which politicians and officials shared intimate images of Indigenous
  women – including her – she blew the whistle. The ensuing uproar set back the
  careers of powerful men, who had to leave their jobs or give up candidacies
  for political posts. But it also cost Sandra career opportunities, says her
  family. “Sandra paid dearly for denouncing that group,” says Kisha. “She lost
  a lot of friends in politics.” The following year, she moved to María
  Lombardo, where she helped mediate relations between Mixe communities. She
  also kept up her activism, helping victims of rape and families of disappeared
  or murdered women. In 2023, she made national news again when she helped
  Aracely Cruz, a Mixe economist, denounce her ex-partner, Donato Vargas
  Jiménez, a powerful political figure in Oaxaca, for domestic violence – and
  for his participation in another misogynistic WhatsApp group similar to the
  one in 2020. “Without knowing me, she came to my defence. She was the best
  friend I could have found in that moment,” says Cruz. After that, her family
  says Sandra received anonymous phone calls describing her movements and
  telling her they would be “her shadow”. When Cruz won a seat in parliament in
  the 2024 elections, she wanted Sandra to join her team in Mexico City, but
  Sandra said no. Cruz says: “I asked her if I had done something wrong. She
  simply said, ‘No, just look after yourself.’ And that left me worried. Why did
  she say that?” A few months later, Sandra, then 38 years old, disappeared.
  After they arrived in María Lombardo, the family says they tried to file a
  missing person’s report for Sandra, but local officials were unhelpful. “They
  told us to wait a few days, to check that Sandra hadn’t just gone partying,”
  says Kisha. In their desperation, the family began asking Sandra’s neighbours
  if they knew anything, but say people were afraid to talk to them. They also
  say they were tailed by a red pickup truck. Friends told them it was not safe
  to stay in the town. On 8 October 2024, the government finally declared Sandra
  missing. And on 11 October, the family held a press conference in the city of
  Oaxaca to spread the word, and the case became national news. “It took off
  because this was the woman who had denounced the WhatsApp groups. And all of
  us realised that if we let them take one of us now, they could take any of
  us,” says Yésica Sánchez Maya, director of Consorcio Oaxaca, a feminist
  organisation. In Oaxaca, the family led marches and set up camp outside the
  governor’s office. They wrote a public letter to president Claudia Sheinbaum,
  while Cruz herself later held a press conference in Mexico City. The UN and
  international human rights organisations called for urgent action from
  authorities. The family have been critical of the investigation and when men
  on motorbikes began following them, taking photos, they felt they were being
  intimidated into silence. “If it happened like this with Sandra, just imagine
  what it is like with other victims of forced disappearance who aren’t so well
  known,” says Kisha. By the time the bodies were found in late April this year,
  the decomposition was advanced. The authorities told them it might take months
  to prove it was really Sandra and her husband, by finding DNA they could
  extract, or analysing the teeth. Unable to bear the thought of waiting, Kisha,
  who is a dentist, did it herself. “They asked me not to, for the sake of my
  emotional and mental wellbeing,” says Kisha. “But my wellbeing went to hell
  long before that.” In finding Sandra, the family says they have a bitter kind
  of closure that few families of the disappeared in Mexico find. “It’s not the
  way we wanted to find her,” they said in a press conference the day it was
  announced. “But now she is home.” Yet, they may never know for certain who
  killed the couple and why. The authorities have asserted that Sandra’s
  disappearance was related to organised crime, claiming that her husband,
  Hernández, 48, who disappeared alongside her, was a member of a criminal
  group. The family preferred not to comment on Sandra’s husband, but were
  furious about the implicit “criminalisation” of Sandra, and want the
  authorities to reconsider her activism as a line of investigation in her
  disappearance. Oaxaca is the most dangerous state in Mexico for activists.
  Since 2018, 58 people have been murdered and six more are missing. In Mexico,
  about 2,500 women are murdered a year, but less than a third are categorised
  as femicides even when there is evidence they should be. Less than a quarter
  of femicides are punished. Since Sandra was found, the family says they have
  had no update on the investigation. They want to continue speaking out, but
  are fearful: they say the tyres on their car have been slashed, and strangers
  sometimes take photos of their home. “But I’d like this to mark a before and
  after: for women to be able to speak up without being silenced,” says Kisha.
