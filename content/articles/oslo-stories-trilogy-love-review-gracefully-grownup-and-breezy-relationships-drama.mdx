  Oslo Stories Trilogy: Love review – gracefully grownup and breezy
  relationships drama
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-13T06:00:44Z'
bodyText: >-
  Here is the second of Norwegian film-maker and novelist Dag Johan Haugerud’s
  seductive trilogy about affairs of the heart and mind, set in Oslo. (It comes
  between Sex and Dreams.) It is a thoroughly grownup and absorbing drama, acted
  with such sympathy and warmth, a ruminative and exploratory movie of ideas,
  and one that pays its audience the compliment of treating them as intelligent
  beings. Love is about a familiar question: can straight people learn from or
  even absorb the open and polygamous approach to sex that appears to come
  easier to gay people (and perhaps younger people of all sexualities), perhaps
  specifically gay men? Or is that idea stereotypical and naive? Andrea Braein
  Hovig plays Marianne, a urology consultant whose job it is to give bad news to
  a succession of men about their prostate cancer. She is single (though her
  past romantic life remains a mystery); her best friend, Heidi (Marte
  Engebrigtsen), tries to set her up with a divorced friend. But Marianne finds
  herself restive with the whole monolithic idea of dating and relationships and
  she is fascinated with what her nurse Tor (Tayo Cittadella Jacobsen) tells her
  about his own life. After work, she encounters him on their commuter ferry and
  he candidly tells her he uses Grindr to set up exciting, ephemeral encounters
  on this very craft. But it is Tor who is to develop serious feelings for one
  of his hook-ups – a urology patient at the hospital – and Marianne who
  experiments with openness, which is to upset others who feel obscurely
  threatened. Perhaps some of the characters are a bit too good to be true, and
  Marianne’s shrewd warning to Tor about immediately developing a “nurse”
  relationship to a partner is something whose implications are not heeded.
  Haugerud has something of Eric Rohmer, and perhaps a little more of Hong
  Sang-soo; a readiness to simply talk, and talk and talk some more. It’s
  surprisingly cinematic. • Oslo Stories Trilogy: Love is in UK and Irish
  cinemas from 15 August.
