  Have a glass of warm milk. No, a cup of herbal tea. Eat carbs, but only the
  right carbs. Have fats, but not too much. Have a filling meal. No, not that
  filling. Eat early, but not too early or you’ll get hungry again later. Ask
  the internet for advice on how to eat for a good night’s sleep and you could
  lose a whole night trying to find a clear answer. But amid a global shortage
  of good sleep (48% of Australian adults report having at least two
  sleep-related problems), dietary habits are emerging as an important factor
  that can make the difference between refreshing rest and a night spent
  regretting every food choice you made in the previous 24 hours. Some of the
  most useful insights into the effect of timing, size and quality of meals on
  sleep come from studies of those who work through the night to keep our world
  running. At CQUniversity in Adelaide, research psychologist Dr Charlotte Gupta
  has been studying how different eating patterns affect shift workers’
  performance. Her most important piece of advice for a good night’s sleep is to
  eat well before bedtime. “We’re not primed to be digesting food at night,”
  Gupta says. A meal eaten too close to sleep forces the body to focus energy
  and resources on digestion, when it should be resting and performing other
  tasks that take place while we rest. “So it’s likely to impact the quality of
  our sleep; we’re more likely to wake up during the night, remember our dreams,
  not get that really restorative sleep,” she says. The ideal is to eat your
  last food at least two hours before going to sleep, which means no pre-sleep
  pecking at leftovers or midnight raid of the fridge for a spoonful of cold
  pudding. The size of that final meal can also make a difference. Ideally, we
  should be having a bigger meal in the middle of the day, when light exposure
  means our body is very much awake and primed for digestion, and a smaller meal
  in the evening. But not too small. “We don’t want it to be so small for dinner
  that you feel really hungry during the night, that your body’s going to wake
  you up and want food,” Gupta says. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning On the question of
  what to eat for a good night’s sleep, the answer is less clearcut, says
  exercise physiologist and nutritionist Dr Elizabeth Machan from the Woolcock
  Institute of Medical Research and the University of Sydney. “We haven’t got
  extensive research that has given us the perfect recipe for what the evening
  meal should be,” she says. There’s some evidence that higher-fat meals are
  more filling, so in theory people will have more restful sleep, Machan says.
  But diets high in fat are also associated with shorter sleep duration.
  Similarly, despite the popular idea that eating carbs before bedtime is bad,
  some studies suggest having a meal higher in carbohydrate can actually help
  people get to sleep faster. “I think a lot of people might avoid carbs in the
  evening, for instance, or they’ll reduce their carb intake in the evening, and
  that’s when they can become more food-seeking later in the night as a result,”
  she says. Machan says it’s important to include vegetables in that evening
  meal to help slow the digestive process. “Your gut’s going to be exposed to
  those nutrients for longer, it’ll have a better chance of absorbing them,” she
  says. “So if you’ve got a meal that is lower energy, for instance, it’s going
  to keep you full, you’re not going to wake up in the middle of the night
  hungry.” There’s a lot of interest in micronutrients such as the amino acid
  tryptophan, which the body can convert into the sleep hormone melatonin, and
  which is found in a range of foods including eggs, tofu, salmon, milk, turkey
  and some nuts and seeds. While some studies suggest increasing tryptophan
  intake might boost melatonin and improve sleep quality, Machan is more
  sceptical, arguing that light exposure is much more important in regulating
  melatonin. “You’re not going to make [melatonin] if you’re sitting in light –
  it’s a signal that we’re not needing to go to sleep, that it’s daytime,” she
  says. One of the challenges with exploring the link between diet and sleep is
  that it’s a two-way street, says Dr Jen Walsh, director of the Centre for
  Sleep Science at the University of Western Australia. Studies connecting late
  meal times with poor sleep are measuring not necessarily sleep quality on one
  night, but over the past month. “I think what it’s telling us is that
  individuals who have poorer sleep are more likely to eat later in the
  evening.” While one way of looking at it is that eating later means
  poorer-quality sleep, another way of interpreting the data is that people who
  have poorer-quality sleep are more likely to eat later. “It’s potentially [the
  case] that people who eat later have worse health behaviours in general,” she
  says. Like so many other health stories, good sleep ultimately seems to come
  back to that same old chestnut of healthy diet, healthy lifestyle. “I say that
  sleep impacts diet and it also impacts exercise, so really we need to be
  getting the sleep right, and it will get everything else right,” Walsh says.
