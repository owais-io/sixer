  Pop, rock and more David Byrne – Who Is the Sky? For Byrne’s first album since
  his hugely acclaimed American Utopia tour – and the subsequent Spike
  Lee-directed film – he’s working with an orchestra, as well as St Vincent and
  Paramore singer Hayley Williams, among others. The two tracks released so far,
  She Explains Things To Me and Everybody Laughs, have proved to be sweetly
  sunny and driven by acoustic guitar. The accompanying tour – due to reach
  Europe next year – will apparently “blend visual art, storytelling and music
  into one compelling live performance”. • Released 5 September Saint Etienne –
  International Saint Etienne have been an endlessly fascinating fixture on the
  leftfield of pop for 25 years, spawning everything from Top 10 singles to
  documentaries about the Lea Valley and the South Bank. Their most recent
  albums I’ve Been Trying To Tell You and The Night have delved into
  concept-driven ambient experimental territory with hugely rewarding results,
  but International is to be their final release. Something of the breadth of
  their approach is revealed by the list of collaborators, which stretches from
  DJ Erol Alkan to 80s heart-throb Nick Heyward. • Released 5 September Jade –
  That’s Showbiz Baby Jade Thirlwall’s former band Little Mix made a clutch of
  great hits but nothing that could prepare you for the deeply idiosyncratic
  charms of Thirwall’s tempo-shifting Puppet On a String-sampling Angel of My
  Dreams. If subsequent releases haven’t quite bent the rules in such a striking
  manner, then they’ve certainly been of an impressively high quality, pushing
  her debut solo album into the “eagerly awaited” category. • Released 12
  September Self Esteem Rebecca Taylor’s third album as Self Esteem, A
  Complicated Woman, didn’t propel her into pop’s big league in the way some
  people expected, but no matter. The high-concept, tightly choreographed live
  shows she’s thus far performed around it – in a West End theatre shortly
  before its release and at a packed-out Park stage at Glastonbury shortly after
  – were rapturously received and understandably so: a sometime actor, Taylor
  has a keen sense of theatricality, but she’s also a straightforwardly
  commanding, hugely engaging performer. • Tour begins 15 September, 02 Academy
  Birmingham Cardi B – Am I the Drama? The follow-up to a debut album that came
  out in 2018 – the rapper has been concentrating on motherhood in the
  intervening period – Am I the Drama? has been so long in the pipeline that at
  least one of the singles confirmed as part of the tracklisting, the
  chart-topping, controversy-generating Megan Thee Stallion collaboration WAP,
  is five years old. Whatever your reasons, taking an extended leave of absence
  is a risky business in a genre as fast-moving as hip-hop: whether Am I the
  Drama? succeeds in re-establishing her at its centre remains to be seen. •
  Released 19 September Kokoroko The London jazz collective’s most recent album
  Tuff Times Never Last offered up a gorgeous selection of midtempo but funky
  tracks influenced in equal part by Afrobeat, highlife and – occasionally –
  old-fashioned 80s British soul. Its contents were frequently gorgeous –
  blissful single Sweetie is a hot afternoon in musical form – but when playing
  live, the band really come into their own: the danceability is amped up, the
  fluid virtuosity of the musicianship becomes even more evident. • Tour begins
  19 September, Leeds Project House Robert Plant – Saving Grace Robert Plant’s
  “new” band – formed with musicians local to his home on the Welsh borders –
  first debuted six years ago with a handful of small UK gigs at which they
  performed an intriguing range of covers and a couple of Led Zeppelin classics.
  A similar approach informs their debut album, intermittently recorded over six
  years, with the admirably eclectic Plant and co essaying tracks by everyone
  from Memphis Minnie to Moby Grape to Low. • Released 26 September Lady Gaga
  The noisy electronics, big pop choruses and dancefloor-facing beats of Lady
  Gaga’s last album Mayhem felt like a restatement of her core pop values after
  the commercial and creative wobble of her appearance in Joker: Folie à Deux
  and her accompanying jazz-infused album Harlequin. If US reviews are anything
  to go by, the Mayhem Ball tour offers a suitably eye-popping high-camp,
  high-production-value theatrical extravaganza, described by one unexpected
  concert-goer, Nancy Pelosi, as “the most fun I’ve had in a long time”. • Tour
  begins 29 September, London O2 Arena CMAT Pop is a notoriously tricky business
  to predict, but you wouldn’t bet against CMAT’s third album Euro-Country being
  a hit on a scale that far outstrips her past work. It’s musically more
  expansive than its country-infused predecessors and stuffed with fantastic,
  provocative songs, as evidenced by the viral success of Take a Sexy Picture of
  Me. And, as anyone who caught her Glastonbury appearance knows, she is
  absolutely fantastic live: sharp, exceptionally funny, blessed with an
  incredible voice and quite unlike anyone else around. • Tour beings 2 October,
  O2 Academy Brixton Taylor Swift – The Life of a Showgirl Rumblings of a new
  Swift album seemed impossible: the glitter from the Eras tour had only just
  settled; she had a new album just last year. Underrate pop’s most
  high-achieving workaholic at your peril: she recently revealed that she
  recorded her 12th album between Eras dates, flying to Sweden to record with
  Max Martin and Shellback – the co-architects of her most laser-guided pop
  smashes from Red, 1989 and Reputation. No one’s heard a peep, but she’s
  promised “melodies that [are] so infectious you’re almost angry … and lyrics
  that are just as vivid”. • Released 3 October Little Simz Simz’s sixth album,
  Lotus, was not an easy listen: it emerged from a period of turmoil in which
  she started and scrapped four different full-length projects and ended up
  suing her former chief collaborator Inflo; its angry, diaristic lyrics were
  matched with raw, occasionally rock-facing production. But it seems to have
  done nothing to halt the rapper’s continuing rise: after she curated and
  performed at this year’s Meltdown festival on the South Bank, she’s ascended
  to arenas for this autumn tour. • Tour begins 16 October, Manchester Co-op
  Live Jalen Ngonda If your tastes run to classic soul, then US-born, UK-based
  singer-songwriter Jalen Ngonda represents the real deal. His voice is
  incredible – there are shades of Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin about his
  delivery, but his sound is his own – and he’s a skilled songwriter, as his
  2023 debut album Come Around and Love Me and the handful of singles he’s
  released since displayed. He’s also reliably fantastic live: relentless
  touring means tickets are already running low for these UK shows. • Tour
  begins 16 October, Newcastle City Hall Jasmine.4.t Jasmine Cruickshank’s You
  Are the Morning is one of 2025’s finest debut albums. She has what would once
  have been called “heavy friends” on board – it was produced by Boygenius,
  whose Phoebe Bridgers signed Cruickshank to her Saddest Factory label – but,
  in truth, she doesn’t need the endorsement of alt-rock royalty. She’s a
  fantastic songwriter in the old-fashioned, rough-hewn indie manner, who’s
  transformed tough personal challenges into powerful and ultimately
  joy-bringing music. • Tour begins 11 November, London Scala Kneecap Somewhere
  underneath the continual tumult surrounding Kneecap, there lurks a band who
  are exceptionally good at what they do, not that the attendant furore has
  dented their popularity. Quite the opposite: a July gig in Glasgow sold out in
  80 seconds after they were dropped from the Trnsmt festival, while this tour
  is bookended by a September date at Wembley Arena – which provoked more
  controversy after a poster advertising the show was banned from the London
  Underground – and two sold-out arena dates in Dublin. • Tour begins 18
  September at the OVO Arena Wembley London Lorde Lorde debuted her fourth album
  Virgin, in its entirety, at a not-so-secret performance at this summer’s
  Glastonbury, her first live appearance in the UK for three years. That it
  attracted a mixed response tells you more about playing 40 minutes of unheard
  material to a festival audience than said material’s quality: Virgin is an
  impressively dark, emotionally ragged restatement of the dance-pop sound of
  2017’s Melodrama – and expectations understandably run high for her tour. •
  Tour begins 15 November, Manchester Co-op Live Stereolab After a decade-long
  hiatus, Stereolab returned to a pop world that seemed to have come around to
  their way of thinking, at least a little. Critically revered outliers in the
  90s – lyrics influenced by Marxist critical theory, music by Krautrock and
  esoteric electronica – they now find themselves acclaimed by Tyler, the
  Creator and Pharrell Williams, their motorik sound a regular rock trope, and
  their critiques of late-stage capitalism mainstreamed. And yet they still
  sound entirely unique and wonderful: comeback album Instant Holograms on Metal
  Film is a gem. • Tour begins 15 December at Royal Festival Hall, London
  Classical The Dream of Gerontius A homecoming for Elgar’s mighty oratorio –
  the greatest of his choral works. Written for the Birmingham music festival,
  this performance will take place almost exactly 125 years after its premiere
  in Birmingham town hall. Kazuki Yamada conducts the City of Birmingham
  Symphony Orchestra with soloists Roderick Williams, Jess Dandy and David Butt
  Philip. • Symphony Hall, Birmingham, 17 September Oliver Leith’s Garland The
  young British composer most substantial work since his 2022 eye-catching Kurt
  Cobain-inspired opera Last Days has its world premiere at Peckham’s Bold
  Tendencies, the former multistorey. He describes it as a “big processional”
  piece; 118 performers will be involved, plus apparently, a horse, bicycles, a
  car and other pedestrian detritus “played” to create noise and rhythm. • Bold
  Tendencies, London, 18-19 September Cinderella (La Cenerentola) Her probing
  staging of Flying Dutchman earlier this summer for Opera Holland Park won
  acclaim; what will Julia Burbach make of Rossini’s Cinderella story? ENO opens
  a much reduced season with the sparkling comic opera with Burbach and
  conductor Yi-Chen Lin both making their Coliseum debuts • Coliseum, London, 27
  September-14 October Chineke! Beethoven’s Triple Concerto After a Prom with
  Simon Rattle, the Black and ethnically diverse orchestra continue their 10th
  birthday celebrations with Beethoven’s Triple Concerto, featuring three of
  their most celebrated alumni, Tai Murray, Sheku Kanneh-Mason and Isata
  Kanneh-Mason. A new work by Errollyn Wallen, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s Ballade
  and William Dawson’s Negro Folk Symphony complete the touring programme. •
  Warwick Arts Centre, 24 September; Royal Festival Hall, London, 28 September;
  National Concert Hall, Dublin, 30 September Tamboo-Bamboo: Concerto for
  Timpani and Orchestra The world premiere of Matthew Rooke’s concerto
  spotlights the Trinidadian instrument with a rich and complex history.
  Beethoven’s Eroica ends the evening, Andrzej Panufnik’s Sinfonia Sacra opens a
  fascinating concert with US conductor Anthony Parnther making his debut with
  the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. • Usher Hall, Edinburgh, 24 October;
  Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, 25 October The Hallé’s John Adams festival A
  three-day festival celebrates US composer John Adams, with works old and new
  across four concerts. The composer himself will conduct his choral symphony,
  Harmonium, his longtime collaborator the violinist Leila Josefowicz will
  perform Scheherezade.2 (written for her), and the UK premiere of his newest
  composition, the The Rock You Stand On, brings the mini-festival to a close. •
  Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 30 October to 1 November The Railway Children
  Earlier this year the Royal Opera’s triumphant staging of Festen confirmed
  Mark-Anthony Turnage as one of the leading opera composers of our day. How
  would he follow that troubling tale of paedophilia, racism and deceit? With an
  adaption of E Nesbit’s much-loved gentle and quaint 1906 children’s story, of
  course. • Glyndebourne, 30 October to 1 November; 8 November Queen Elizabeth
  Hall, London (semi-staged) The Makropulos Case, Royal Opera Janáček’s
  enigmatic late masterpiece comes to Covent Garden for the first time in a
  staging by Katie Mitchell and with Royal Ballet and Opera’s newly installed
  Czech-born music director Jakub Hrůša in the pit. Ausrine Stundyte is Emilia,
  blessed – or cursed – with immortality, and the top notch cast also includes
  Peter Hoare, Johan Reuter and Alan Oke. • Royal Opera House, London, 4-21
  November Rebecca Clarke Focus Day Clarke (1886-1979) was a pioneering
  instrumentalist and composer who was declared by Gramophone “one of the very
  best of her time”, and “almost certainly the best composer of any period to
  have also been a woman”. A day of concerts, talks and music by her
  contemporaries offers a chance to hear much of her little-played and
  little-known music. Performers include Kitty Whately, Ailish Tynan and pianist
  Anna Tilbrook. • Wigmore Hall, London, 8 November Bavarian Radio Symphony
  Orchestra and Simon Rattle in Liverpool Almost 50 years to the day since their
  last visit, the Munich orchestra returns to Merseyside with its new
  Liverpool-born conductor. Half a century ago, the young Simon was in the
  audience to hear them. Now, he leads the band in a programme of Schumann and
  Stravinsky. • Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, 10 November
