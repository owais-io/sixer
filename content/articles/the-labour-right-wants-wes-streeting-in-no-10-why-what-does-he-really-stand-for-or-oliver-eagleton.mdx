  Just over a year after Keir Starmer entered Downing Street, his political
  survival already looks uncertain. Perennially indecisive, unpopular with the
  public and unable to pass major legislation without rebellions, the prime
  minister has reportedly been put “on notice” by senior figures within his
  party. Speculation about a potential successor is mounting. What would
  Labour’s dominant faction – the neo-Blairite right – look for in a candidate?
  Their best bet would be an effective operator who doesn’t carry too much
  political baggage, a decent communicator, free of Starmer’s stumbling
  reticence, and a committed partisan of their cause: namely the free market and
  a strong state. They need someone who will go on the offensive for these
  values, rather than offering the bland apologetics that we have seen from the
  incumbent. Few fit the bill better than the health secretary, Wes Streeting,
  who has made no secret of his ambition to lead the country and appears to have
  spent years laying the groundwork with media rounds, donor events and backroom
  conversations. When Starmer’s leadership of the Labour party was on the brink
  during the Beergate scandal, Peter Mandelson is said to have canvassed the
  Labour frontbench to anoint Streeting. “In the longer term,” briefed one party
  source, “Wes is their guy, not Keir.” Born into a working-class east London
  family in 1983, Streeting has been fairly consistent in both his political
  style and outlook since he was in his early 20s. A pugnacious advocate of
  private enterprise, and an effective behind-the-scenes operator, his deft
  handling of the press allows him to stride into the limelight at crucial
  moments, with memorable one-liners that seem crafted to enrage his opponents.
  As president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in the twilight of the
  New Labour era, he inveighed against lecturers’ strikes, remarking that
  “students need industrial action by university staff like a hole in the head”.
  He also broke with dominant student opinion by supporting tuition fees and
  criticising Palestine solidarity protests. From the NUS it was only a small
  step to parliament, where Streeting landed in 2015. The words “future leader”
  were immediately “appended to his name like a Homeric epithet”, according to
  one insider account. He vigorously opposed the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn,
  repeatedly excoriating him in parliamentary meetings and working with the
  People’s Vote campaign to chip away at his resistance to a second Brexit
  referendum. This earned him a place in Starmer’s shadow cabinet once the right
  had regained control five years later. There, he made no bones about accepting
  hundreds of thousands of pounds from donors linked to the private healthcare
  industry. He insisted that the party needed to get tough on “law and order”
  along with “defence and national security”; and he signalled a clear shift
  from the foreign policy of the Corbyn era by visiting Israel and meeting with
  ministers in its government. Now that Streeting is at the helm of the NHS, we
  are beginning to see how his hypothetical prime ministership might play out.
  Shortly after the last general election, he sketched out his vision for the
  health service in the pages of the Sun, writing that “major surgery” was
  needed to make it “fit for the future”: moving treatment out of hospitals, so
  as to focus on local care and prevention. This could not be achieved through
  public spending, Streeting warned, because “the money isn’t there”. It could
  only be done through hard-knuckled “reform”. True to his word, Streeting has
  helped to normalise the state of perma-austerity at the health department,
  which will receive only an extra 2.8% annually in real terms over the coming
  years: less than the long-term historical norm of 3.7%, and far below the
  average increase of 6.8% under New Labour. This is nowhere near enough to
  solve the perpetual crisis in the sector, let alone make any real improvements
  in the quality of care. Without meaningful investment, the levers that
  Streeting can pull to realise his goals are limited. There is reorganisation
  through measures such as the summary abolition of NHS England and mass job
  cuts. There is techno-optimism, allowing AI companies such as Palantir to run
  parts of the ailing service. And, most importantly, there is privatisation.
  Streeting has been working hard to ensure that “more treatments can be
  delivered through the independent sector”, as an official briefing put it.
  Under his watch, an even greater portion of the NHS – including, potentially,
  sensitive patient data – is being handed over to profit-making companies. His
  plan to set up 300 “neighbourhood health hubs” is powered by corporate
  finance, in what is shaping up to be a frame-by-frame replay of the disastrous
  PFI initiatives of the 2000s. Research shows that the effect of these policies
  is to worsen health inequality. But this does not seem to concern the
  minister. Bullish as ever, Streeting has said he is “up for the fight” that
  his plan will provoke. And that is what he now has. In recent weeks, resident
  doctors rejected his notion that “reform” alone will magically resolve the
  service’s deep-rooted problems of under-resourcing and understaffing. They
  refused to accept a pay deal that would amount to a 21% reduction in their
  salaries since 2008, and instead made a principled case for wage restoration.
  Streeting was intransigent. During the resulting five-day strike he launched a
  series of broadsides against the workers, insisting that they must feel the
  “pain” of the walkouts and vowing that they would “lose a war with this
  government”. Much like his “bullet in the head” rhetoric, the remarks showed
  that Streeting’s main interest is in positioning himself as a crusader on
  behalf of the establishment rather than fixing the service he oversees. He is
  also keenly aware of the populist appeal of his rhetoric at a time when
  support for the doctors’ struggle is in decline. The other front on which
  Streeting has been fighting is the culture war. He has imposed a permanent ban
  on puberty blockers for trans children – despite a wealth of dissenting expert
  opinion including that of the British Medical Association, which disputes the
  scientific basis of the prohibition – and he has also barred those under 18
  from changing gender markers on their NHS records, potentially making it more
  difficult for them to access vital services. The irony, of course, is that
  while Streeting styles himself as the man to beat Nigel Farage, his politics
  is one of deference to big business, clampdowns on trans rights and incendiary
  rhetoric to provoke the left. These features are more typically associated
  with reactionary populism than with social democracy. Streeting’s ascent
  reflects the fact that, in today’s Labour party, the former is cannibalising
  the latter. Oliver Eagleton is an associate editor at the New Left Review and
