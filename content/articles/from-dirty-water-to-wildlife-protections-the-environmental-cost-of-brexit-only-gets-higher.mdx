  From dirty water to wildlife protections, the environmental cost of Brexit
  only gets higher

  Brexit has been terrible for environmental legislation in this country, since
  we left the EU in 2021. While the EU has strengthened its environmental
  protections, the UK has drifted away from those regulations, in some cases our
  politicians deciding to rip up EU environmental laws entirely. I have been
  spending the past couple of years tracking this divergence, alongside some
  excellent analysts from the Institute for European Environmental Policy. And
  as we reported this week, it’s looked pretty bleak, with laws on important
  areas from air pollution to water quality weakened. When Labour won power last
  year, promising strengthened environmental protections and a reset with the
  EU, many environmentalists breathed a sigh of relief. Perhaps the damage of
  the Conservative government would be undone. This was not to be the case. As
  we reported this week, Keir Starmer’s government has instead cut environmental
  protections further and faster than the Tories ever did. Despite that promised
  “reset” with the EU, Keir Starmer’s government has failed to even start
  closing loopholes in environmental law that have widened since Brexit, and is
  in some cases choosing to delete EU environmental rules from the statute book.
  Our analysis found the UK is falling behind the EU in terms of protecting rare
  creatures such as red squirrels, cleaning up our polluted air and water,
  removing dangerous chemicals from products and making consumer items more
  recyclable and energy efficient. One of the main reasons for this is that the
  bureaucrats at the EU are some of the best regulators in the world, with huge
  amounts of funding and expertise allowing them to, for example, decide which
  chemicals are dangerous and should be banned (think those lurid coloured dyes
  that are banned in Europe but still allowed in the US). They are also good at
  coming up with novel ways to remove pollution from the environment. One
  example is water treatment. We are outraged in the UK about the quality of our
  water, from sewage being dumped in lakes, rivers and seas. Indeed, we are at
  the bottom of the leaderboard when it comes to the cleanliness of our bathing
  waters. At the moment, we have three levels of water treatment in our sewage
  systems: primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary is the removal of large
  solids, secondary is the removal of dissolved matter, and tertiary removes
  pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The EU is going one layer deeper
  and introducing quaternary treatment, a hi-tech way of removing microplastics,
  dangerous “forever chemicals” and other chemicals from waterways. And they are
  making polluting companies pay for these new treatment centres. If we were
  still in the EU we would have to follow these rules, too. But there are no
  current plans for the UK to update our sewage systems to match the EU’s. We
  are falling behind, and simply not developing at the pace of other countries
  when it comes to removing harmful waste from the environment. (Even the red
  tape-free Singapore has quaternary treatment.) Another major problem is where
  the UK has decided to actively diverge from the EU’s strong environmental
  protections. The Tories, for example, loosened EU air pollution rules,
  changing the thresholds for dangerous pollution in the air. They also started
  the process of removing the legal duties under the Water Framework Directive
  to monitor the cleanliness of rivers, and ultimately clean them up. Labour is
  desperate to fix the creaking economy, and with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,
  politically unable to cut spending or meaningfully raise taxes, economic
  growth is the only hope. Ministers therefore are happy to, for example,
  sacrifice the environmental regulations that limit developers from building in
  pursuit of that singular goal of boosting growth. This means tearing up the
  EU’s Habitats Directive, which is there to protect rare creatures like
  nightingales, red squirrels and dormice. This is the biggest divergence so far
  since Brexit and means that these creatures in the UK now have far less
  protection than they do in the EU. You will remember from the bitter EU
  referendum campaign that those who were against leaving Europe were accused of
  “fearmongering” when they said that it would lead to weakened environmental
  protections. Former environment secretary Michael Gove promised a “green
  Brexit”, and Boris Johnson, prime minister when we left the EU, lauded our
  “world-beating” environmental protections and promised to uphold them. Now the
  dust has settled, it’s clear that the “fearmongers” were right. Read more: UK
