  Honor’s latest foldable phone-tablet attempts to usurp Samsung as the leader
  of the pack with a super-thin body, massive battery and a ginormous camera
  lump on the back. The Magic V5 is an impressively thin piece of engineering,
  slimmed down to about 8.9mm thick when shut, with each half about the same
  thickness as a USB-C port. It feels very similar to a standard slab phone in
  the hand, but one you can open up like a book for a mini-tablet on the go. The
  foldable costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99), undercutting the competition from
  Samsung and Google by up to £100, but still very much at the eye-wateringly
  expensive end of the smartphone market. The Magic V5 comes in various colours
  with different materials on the back that make the phone varying thicknesses
  and weights. At 222g or under it is slightly heavier than Samsung’s latest
  Fold 7, but far lighter than the rest of the folding phone competition, and
  about the same weight as a large slab phone. The outside 6.43in OLED screen is
  great and acts just like a regular phone while the inside 7.95in folding
  screen is one of the best, with an impressive brightness. It still has a
  crease down the middle but you don’t notice it in use. The inside screen is
  necessarily softer than traditional phone screens to allow it to bend, so you
  have to treat it with care; and it is a fingerprint magnet. The Honor is one
  of the first folding phones to be water- and dust-resistant to similar
  standards as a regular phone. That means fine particles shouldn’t be able to
  get behind the moving, flexible screen and metal hinge, which has been a
  durability concern for all foldables. Specifications Main screen: 7.95in
  (403ppi) 120Hz OLED flexible display Cover screen: 6.43in (405ppi) 120Hz OLED
  Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite RAM: 16GB Storage: 512GB Operating
  system: MagicOS 9.0.1 (Android 15) Camera: 50MP + 50MP ultrawide + 64MP 3x
  tele; 2x 20MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, dual sim + esim, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC,
  Bluetooth 6, GNSS Water resistance: IP58 and IP59 (immersion and high pressure
  jets) Dimensions folded: 156.8 x 74.3 x 8.88-9mm Dimensions unfolded: 156.8 x
  145.9 x 4.1-4.2mm Weight: 217-222g Top Snapdragon chip and a high-capacity
  battery The Magic V5 has Qualcomm’s current top Android chip, the Snapdragon 8
  Elite, matching rivals and flagship phones. It feels responsive in day-to-day
  activities, plays games very well and doesn’t get too hot when pushed hard.
  But that power is best used when multitasking, as you can run up to four apps
  on screen at once – half as many as Samsung’s Fold 7 but more than enough to
  actually be able to use. More impressive is the high-capacity battery Honor
  has managed to squeeze into the svelte frame, which is larger than most big
  slab phones, let alone folders. That means the battery life is great, but as
  with other folding phones it varies a lot depending on which screen you use
  most. Used primarily as a tablet for browsing and watching video with four
  hours of 5G usage, the Magic V5 lasts a good 37 hours between charges. With
  more balanced usage across the two screens it lasts into a third day before
  running out of juice. MagicOS software still needs work The Magic V5 runs
  Honor’s MagicOS 9, which is based on last year’s Android 15 rather than the
  latest Android 16. But Honor will provide seven years of Android version and
  security updates for devices sold within Europe, which is a dramatic
  improvement over previous efforts, and similar in length to its main rivals.
  The software has some good ideas, but as with previous versions it still has
  some rough areas and irritating behaviours. The outside screen works mostly
  like any other Android phone with Gemini and various other AI tools. But it is
  on the inside screen where the software shines and irritates. You can place
  three apps in a splitscreen at once, with one of them pushed partially off the
  side of the screen to provide more space for the other two without quitting
  it. Tapping it brings it back on to the screen to use it. It’s a smart idea
  first seen on the OnePlus Open. A button on the taskbar makes arranging your
  multiple windows easy. But tap on an app notification on the inside screen and
  the system insists on opening the app in a mini-window, even if you wanted it
  to be full screen. That might be fine for smaller messaging apps such as
  WhatsApp, but I never want to open Gmail or larger-format apps in tiny windows
  that then need to be tapped a couple more times to fill the full screen. The
  software also doesn’t make good use of the partially folded modes that the
  inside screen can adopt, lacking an equivalent to Samsung’s good Flex mode,
  which seems like a wasted opportunity. Another bug in the typeface on the
  Honor makes it very difficult to see which emails are unread in bold in Gmail,
  which is extremely irritating. Much of these little annoyances would be
  acceptable on cheaper smartphones, but not on a £1,700, ultra-premium device.
  Honor still has work to do. Camera The Magic V5 has a decent set of cameras
  housed in an enormous round camera lump that protrudes from the rear of the
  phone. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good-looking images across a range
  of lighting conditions, though it can become a bit soft with weaker indoor
  lighting. The 50MP ultra-wide camera is solid, but displays a bit of warping
  around the edges of the scene and lacks a bit of fine detail. The 64MP 3x
  optical telephoto camera is the best of the bunch, with good detail and
  colour, even in indoor lighting. It can manage a 6x in-sensor zoom, which is a
  bit softer on detail when viewed at full size but works well in bright light,
  plus digital zoom up to 100x that remains fairly decent up to about 20x
  magnification. The two 20MP selfie cameras are good enough, but you get much
  better results using the main camera and the outside screen for a viewfinder.
  The camera has many different modes to play around with including a smart
  motion capture system that handles action photography and solid video capture.
  It also has a lot of AI and enhancement features that are common to Chinese
  smartphones modifying the appearance of faces and the alike should you wish.
  Overall the camera is one of the better ones on a foldable, though it can’t
  match the best cameraphones on the market. Sustainability The battery has an
  expected lifespan of at least 1,200 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of
  its original capacity. The Magic V5 is generally repairable by Honor, with
  internal screens costing about £700 or external screens about £200 to replace
  out of warranty. Honor offers a free screen repair for 12 months if bought
  within the first month of release. The device contains some recycled plastic.
  Honor publishes limited environmental reports and offers trade-in and
  refurbished products. Price The Honor Magic V5 costs £1,699.99 (€1,999.99).
  For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs from £1,799, the Google
  Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs £1,749, the Galaxy S25 Ultra costs £1,249 and the
  Honor Magic 7 Pro costs £1,099. Verdict Yet again Honor has produced some
  exquisite folding phone hardware that is let down by its software. MagicOS has
  improved over the last few years, but it lacks much of the customisation and
  capabilities possible on rivals. The biggest problem is that it lacks polish,
  with rough patches or irritating behaviours across the system. None of them is
  a deal-breaker, but they build up and can’t be overlooked on a £1,700 phone.
  It’s a shame as the phone is fast, the battery life is great, the camera is
  highly capable and it looks fabulous. It’s good to see Samsung and Google get
  some meaningful competition in book-style foldables. But at about the same
  price as the market leader, Samsung, there’s little reason to pick the Magic
  V5 over it. Pros: super-slim phone and tablet in one, light, just like a
  normal phone when closed, great performance, very long battery life, good
  internal screen, decent camera, good fingerprint scanner, water and dust
  resistance rating. Cons: very expensive, software not as refined as needed
  with irritating behaviours, more fragile than a regular device, costly to
  repair, limited folding modes.
