  ‘Potentially dying waiting’: around 87,000 older Australians hit by delays to
  home care packages

  A year ago, Graham Paxton got government approval to receive aged care support
  in his home, but was told that due to the huge waiting list it could take up
  to two years for him to actually receive it. Around the time he found out he
  qualified for the highest level of home care package available to Australians
  over 65, Graham was told he had just one to two years to live due to a serious
  health condition. By the time the package finally comes through, enabling his
  wife, Kim, to look after him properly, he may no longer be here. “I’m a year
  in [waiting for the support] and he’s a year in,” says Kim, 66. “So he might
  get it when he’s not around to get it.” Graham, 68, is among an estimated
  87,000 older Australians who have been assessed as needing support at home to
  keep living independently – help with bathing, feeding, taking medications,
  cooking, cleaning and transport – but who are still waiting for a home care
  package. Advocacy groups and federal politicians have warned this waitlist
  could balloon to 100,000 by November, meaning that older people are living
  unsafely at home, being forced prematurely into residential care, ending up in
  hospital or dying while waiting for support. The government has pledged to
  increase the number of home care packages available from November, when its
  new Aged Care Act is rolled out. Sam Rae, the minister for aged care and
  seniors, told Guardian Australia: “In the first 12 months of the new Support
  at Home Program alone, we will release more than 80,000 new home care places
  nationwide – because we know demand for aged care services is only growing.”
  But crossbench senators including the Greens’ Penny Allman-Payne and
  independent David Pocock say the government is failing older people by not
  releasing more packages before the act comes into effect. They, alongside the
  Coalition, are expected to move this week to force the government to bring
  forward the releasevia amendments. “[I’ve] been calling for 20,000 of the home
  care packages to be released given the waitlists and the number of people who
  are waiting and potentially dying waiting for a package,” said Pocock. “It’s a
  ration system. So if you are one of the 87,000 [approved people waiting] from
  now to November, the only way you will get a package is if someone who
  currently has a package dies and frees up a package, which I just think is an
  appalling way to deal with older Australians who are trying to age at home
  with dignity.” He said state and territory governments were having to pick up
  the cost. “Our hospitals [are] full of people who otherwise could be getting
  support at home, or people are going into aged care earlier than they should
  have to.” This is exactly the situation facing Graham, who has been in
  hospital for nearly three months, after a flare-up of his condition, hepatic
  encephalopathy, which affects his memory. “He’s not very good on his feet so
  what happens is he’ll have a fall in the house and then the only way to get
  him up off the floor is to call an ambulance and then they’ll take him into
  hospital. So right now he’s in hospital … I just don’t know what to do. As we
  speak, he’s got himself out of bed, he’s sitting at reception, he’s waiting
  for me to pick him up and take him home.” Kim wants to have him home with her,
  but says the hospital is not keen to release him given she is his sole carer,
  and she works full-time, as well as caring for her 92-year-old mother, who
  lives next door. The at-home support would make a huge difference. “It would
  be a relief that I wouldn’t be worrying about him … If he had a fall and I
  wasn’t home and he didn’t have his phone on him, that would be the biggest
  thing. “All I think I really need at the moment is maybe the bathing … some of
  his personal needs. Maybe an hour or two just to get him out of the home when
  I’m working,” says Kim. “I can cook all the food but I’m not sure if he could
  actually boil a jug to make a cup of tea… I came home one day and one of the
  elements was on in the oven. He didn’t realise he left it on. I think I’m at
  the lower end of the scale. I personally don’t think he needs 24-7 care, but
  he can’t sit at home for eight hours a day when I’m not there.” Dozens of
  older people and their carers have shared their stories of difficulty ahead of
  a Senate inquiry that begins on Friday into the Aged Care Act. Among the
  stories shared with the Guardian include those of unpaid carers at the point
  of total burnout, being forced to quit or dramatically reduce work hours in
  order to provide care, and of older people living in unsafe conditions at risk
  of falls and injuries. “My mum had a stroke last year,” one wrote in a
  submission to Pocock’s office. “[She has had] seven falls since last July and
  rapid memory loss and confusion. My heart breaks each time I leave her to go
  to work as she looks like a lost child but I need to work. I am super tired,
  stressed and worried. Mum is declining and I am terrified I will lose her
  before help comes.” Allman-Payne, Greens senator for Queensland, says: “We’ve
  got this situation where we’ve got older Australians who’ve worked their whole
  life, they’ve paid their taxes, they’re contributing to their communities and
  now they’re being left languishing [waiting] to get a home care package … But
  what we know happens is if you can’t get access to a home care package in a
  timely way, then you start getting pushed towards residential aged care
  because you can’t cope.” Kim and Graham met in 1982 while working at the same
  pub. They have been together for 43 years, and this is not how she pictured
  them spending their retirement years. But for now, she doesn’t see another
  path, she doesn’t want to put him in residential care, and so her only option
  is to just keep going until help arrives. “We didn’t choose to be here, trust
  me. Trust me, none of us have put up our hand and said, you know what, at 66,
  I want to be going through this. And I know there are people out there
  probably worse than my husband. “You just do it. I don’t know. You get tired,
  but they’re your family, your loved ones. It breaks my heart … It’s a bit like
  being a mum, isn’t it, with a newborn baby. You start living with less sleep
  and you work harder and you just do what you do for the love of your kids. “I
  really feel like people just don’t realise the numbers out there,” she says.
  “It’s got to be addressed, because it’s just going to blow up bigger and
  bigger and bigger. So we can’t just not talk about it, not address it. It’s
  not good enough. [The government] have got to be held much more accountable.”
