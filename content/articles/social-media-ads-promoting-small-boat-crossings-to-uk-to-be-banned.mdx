  Ministers are to outlaw social media adverts promoting journeys on small boats
  across the Channel to asylum seekers. The government will create a UK-wide
  criminal offence that could lead to perpetrators being sentenced for up to
  five years in prison and a hefty fine. Though facilitating illegal immigration
  is already a crime, the change will make it a specific offence to create
  material for online publication that promotes or offers services that would
  lead to a breach of UK immigration law. This includes advertising small boat
  crossings, selling fake passports, visas and other travel documents, and
  promoting opportunities for illegal work in the UK. Ministers will make the
  change via an amendment to the border security bill, which is making its way
  through its final stages in the House of Lords. Eighty per cent of migrants
  who arrived in the UK on small boats told government officials that they had
  used social media during their journey, including to locate or communicate
  with people smugglers, according to Home Office data. The department said it
  wanted to crack down on smugglers selling a false narrative about life in the
  UK to desperate asylum seekers by criminalising those promising illegal work
  online. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: “Selling the false promise of
  a safe journey to the UK and a life in this country – whether on or offline –
  simply to make money, is nothing short of immoral. “These criminals have no
  issue with leading migrants to life-threatening situations using brazen
  tactics on social media. We are determined to do everything we can to stop
  them – wherever they operate.” The change will also make it a crime to post
  online content that encourages someone to break UK immigration law in exchange
  for money. Cooper will also introduce a new fast-track scheme in the autumn in
  an attempt to address the asylum backlog. The aim is for decisions to be made
  in weeks rather than years and comes after protests in Epping, London,
  Manchester and Newcastle over people staying in hotels while awaiting asylum
  decisions. She will also tighten the rules around the interpretation of
  “exceptional circumstances” in immigration cases and the use of article 8 of
  the European convention on human rights, which protects the right to family
  and private life. Rob Jones, the director general for operations at the
  National Crime Agency (NCA), said: “We know many of the people-smuggling
  networks risking lives transporting people to the UK promote their services to
  migrants using social media. “The majority of migrants arriving in the UK will
  have engaged with smugglers in this way.” The NCA has taken action against
  organised crime groups using social media to promote crossings, including a
  south Wales-based gang convicted in November 2024 after smuggling thousands of
  people across Europe. The gang used social media videos posted by people who
  had made successful crossings to promote the service. Another network operated
  by the Preston-based smuggler Amanj Hasan Zada, who was later jailed for 17
  years, also posted videos of people thanking Zada for helping them. There have
  been cases of Albanian people smugglers who have used social media to promote
  £12,000 “package deals” to get to the UK including accommodation and
  employment, which will also fall under the scope of the new law.
