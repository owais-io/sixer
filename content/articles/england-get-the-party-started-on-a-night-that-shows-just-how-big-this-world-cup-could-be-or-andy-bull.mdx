  It was quiet at Sunderland station on Friday afternoon, and quiet all the way
  up Union and South Streets and quiet all the way along to Keel Square, where
  the World Cup was hidden, waiting around the corner like a surprise party.
  There three, four, five thousand or more were bouncing up and down while a
  stout lad with Spandex trousers, a sequined jacket and serious pipes was
  belting out the opening notes of We Will Rock You on the big stage while his
  band thrashed away behind him. If everywhere else around town was empty, it
  was because everyone was here. It was a hell of a way to start a World Cup.
  “Let’s show them how we do it in the north-east!” shouted out the Mackem
  Mercury as he set a carnival parade off marching over the bridge towards the
  Stadium of Light for the kick-off. Sunderland was a great place for the
  opening game. The tournament has been organised so that 95% of the population
  is within two hours’ travel of a match. Usually you have to go a long way
  further than that to find a good game in the north-east. There isn’t an elite
  women’s rugby club in this corner of the country. The North East Women’s XV
  was launched in 2024, but have struggled to attract enough sponsorship to
  cover kit costs, let alone pay for coaches. There’s no shortage of talent,
  there are more than 100 girls on the RFU pathway just in Durham, never mind
  the surrounding counties, but they have nowhere to go except down south if
  they want to carry on in it. The World Cup is part of an effort to put that
  right. The RFU has pledged to invest plenty of the Impact 25 money it has had
  from the government in this region over the next decade, and the North East
  Combined Authority had pumped £500,000 into the fan zone alone. It showed,
  too. Newcastle Rugby Foundation was running a series of busy skills workshops
  for all the kids there, with radar guns measuring whether they could sprint as
  quick as Ellie Kildunne, or pass as fast as Mo Hunt. Life moves fast, but
  hell, the Women’s World Cup has grown up quicker than the teenage nephew you
  haven’t seen for three years. The last time this tournament was held in this
  country, in 2010, the opening game was played at Surrey Sports Park in
  Guildford, in front of a crowd of just under 3,000 people who were packed into
  temporary grandstands. Fifteen years later, more people than that had turned
  out just to watch the Queen tribute band playing in the fan zone over the road
  from the ground a couple of hours before the match. The crowd for this opening
  game was bigger than the combined attendance for the entire tournament in
  2010, and, from watching it, you would bet World Rugby spent more on the
  fireworks that were let loose from the stadium roof in the minutes before
  kick-off than it did staging that entire edition of the competition. No wonder
  Marlie Packer and Emily Scarratt and a couple of England’s other older players
  made a point of taking a moment for a slow walk around the ground before the
  team warm-up, just to soak in the moment. The game has come a long way even
  since they first played. No one who has been in the sport for any length of
  time seems quite able to believe it, even World Rugby’s higher-ups seem to be
  a bit bewildered by just how popular the women’s game has become all of a
  sudden. The question hanging over the team is exactly how they will cope with
  the occasion given that they have never really had to deal with this much
  attention and expectation. Well, nothing in rugby serves to settle the nerves
  like a good maul, and the Red Roses rolled out a couple at the first good
  chance they had. Sadia Kabeya scored off the second, and their World Cup was
  off and running. England settled the game in a 10-minute stretch late in the
  first half, when the USA were down to 14 players because Alev Kelter had been
  sent to the sin-bin. England put 14 points on them in that period, one try
  from another maul, the other after a neat bit of interplay from Abby Dow and
  Kildunne down the right wing after the USA made a dreadful mess of a restart.
  That put England 21 points up, and from there it was downhill running all the
  way to the whistle. It was late by the time they scored their ninth and 10th
  tries, and some of the thousands of little kids in the crowd were beginning to
  drift away to sleep, their nodding heads snapped back off their parents’
  shoulders by the screams and shouts and intermittent blasts of the White
  Stripes or Depeche Mode coming over the stadium PA as England scored another.
  They had hours to sleep ahead of them in the car ride home, and then in their
  beds, and sweet dreams of Kabeya, Kildunne, Dow and all their other new
  heroes.
