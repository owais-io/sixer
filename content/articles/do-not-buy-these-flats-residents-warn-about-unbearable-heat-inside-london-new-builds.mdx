  ‘Do not buy these flats’: residents warn about unbearable heat inside London

  The sweltering conditions inside Leaside Lock, a new-build development in east
  London, are hardly a secret. Last June, a warning written in big, capital
  letters was stuck to the window of one flat. “DO NOT BUY THESE FLATS. TOO
  HOT,” it read. It was hard to miss for those walking past the looming
  high-rises and, after being snapped and posted on social media, the placard
  has garnered more than 500,000 views. More than a year on, during a summer
  when the UK recorded its second-warmest June and fifth-hottest July since
  1884, residents in the tallest, south-facing block say heat is still an issue.
  “When I’m trying to fall asleep at night, it gets quite unbearable,” said
  Lucian Ho, 21, a student who lives near the top of a 28-storey building in the
  development. Options to cool off in his south-facing flat are limited. “All I
  can do is open the window,” he said. The development is situated in Tower
  Hamlets, which is the most densely populated borough in the UK. Eighty-one per
  cent of households live in purpose-built flats, the second-highest proportion
  in England and Wales and double the London-wide rate. The borough has also
  seen a massive sky-rise boom, with 71 buildings with 20 or more floors being
  built between 2014 and 2024. To top it off, it ranks poorly for green space.
  All these factors come together to make living in the borough a hot box for
  many. Experts have warned that many of the new homes being built in the UK are
  not designed to withstand the more extreme summer temperatures being seen due
  to climate change. They have called for the government to update its upcoming
  future homes standard to include provisions for overheating homes. The
  regulations are due to be published this autumn and to come into force from
  2027, but the focus has been mainly on how to keep homes warm in winter,
  rather than to keep them cool in summer. Up the road from Leaside Lock sits
  another development, Three Waters. “It feels like you’re in a trap,” said
  Sandra Monteiro, who lives on the 11th floor in one of the complex’s blocks.
  The 41-year-old SEND teacher has lived in the flat with her husband for almost
  three years but the sweltering heat means she’s considering leaving. “Our
  temperatures haven’t gone below 27C inside the house in the past two months,”
  she said. Her thermometer peaked at 33C this summer. When temperatures inside
  rise above 25C, risks to health rise too, potentially causing or worsening
  cardiovascular and respiratory issues, sleep disturbance, mental health
  problems and heat exhaustion. Monteiro said the heat in her flat causes
  frequent headaches. “Exhaustion, feeling like we’re out of breath. We have
  experienced feeling very fatigued, even when we wake up,” she said. “When we
  travel abroad we don’t experience as much exhaustion as we do here in the UK,
  which is definitely to do with the heat.” The UK Green Building Council has
  said street trees are a simple and cost effective way to keep homes cool. But
  Monteiro’s block is situated beside the busy A12 and the streets below are
  barren of any green space. “If we have the windows open because of the
  motorway, we get a lot of the dust and the heat that comes from that,” she
  said. She bought a 25% share of the home with her husband for £121,000. On top
  of this, she pays £1,264 per month in rent. “It is my first summer really
  experiencing these high temperatures and I’m feeling quite unsure about
  whether I want to continue living here,” she said. A spokesperson for Peabody,
  which runs Three Waters, said: “We want residents to feel comfortable in their
  homes all year round and work with construction partners to ensure homes are
  designed with ventilation and shading in mind, considering the risk of
  overheating.” They said that since new regulations to reduce the risk of
  new-builds overheating were introduced in 2022, they had added features to new
  homes like external shutters that let in daylight but block out heat. “We’re
  also looking at materials that help keep homes cooler during summer and warmer
  in winter,” it said. Guiness Homes, which runs Leaside Lock, said that of the
  440 properties in their blocks they had only received complaints from four
  homeowners about heat inside their homes, all of whom were given adaptations
  to reduce temperatures. “The image you have shared relates to a homeowner who
  had a specific and unique issue in their property which has been addressed,”
  they said. Farther north in the city sits Kestrel House. The looming 55
  metre-tall council block became a symbol of inner-city life after being
  featured on the cover of The Streets’ debut album Original Pirate Material. It
  lies along a busy thoroughfare in Islington, which – after Tower Hamlets – has
  the second highest population density in the UK. It also suffers from a lack
  of green space, and residents have access to an average of 2m2 of green space
  per capita, the lowest amount of any borough in the UK, according the Friends
  of the Earth. Chris Brown, 76, has lived at the top of Kestrel House since
  1987. In his 38 years living there as a council tenant, he has found heat an
  increasing problem. In the summer, temperatures inside his 17th floor flat
  rarely go below 27C. This year, they reached a high of 30C and in previous
  heatwaves his thermometer has hit a peak of 35C. The semi-retired
  psychotherapist fitted an air conditioning unit in his living room due to
  fears about what the heat could be doing to his health. “I spent as much time
  as I can in here, in front of the blast of cold air from the air conditioning
  unit,” he said. Brown has a heart condition, diabetes and chronic fatigue
  syndrome. “It does cause people to die, so I became worried,” he said. Hot
  homes aren’t just uncomfortable – they can be deadly. During the heatwaves in
  2024, UK Health Security Agency figures estimated that about 358 people died
  at home, in part due to extreme temperatures. Deaths tend to spike because the
  heat exacerbates existing medical conditions, rather than directly causing
  otherwise healthy people to die – overall influenza and pneumonia deaths were
  13% higher than they otherwise would have been during the 2024 heatwaves, and
  circulatory disease deaths, dementia and Alzheimer’s deaths were up 11%. The
  heat affects Brown’s current health conditions. “Heat stress makes my fatigue
  worse so life is just a little bit more of a struggle,” he said. “Sleeping
  became difficult. It tires me out. I was continually feeling more tired than
  usual.” Tall buildings, especially those surrounded by other looming towers,
  are susceptible to the urban heat island effect – where materials like
  concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat. Brown said the heat sticks
  around, even when temperatures outside reduce. “It doesn’t cool down. It’s
  like a brick oven,” he said. Councillor Rowena Champion, executive member for
  environment, air quality and transport for Islington council said: “We are
  aware that many people in Islington live in flats built in a different era
  that weren’t designed for extreme heat. This has a real impact especially for
  older people, those with health conditions, or families with babies. Tackling
  overheating in homes must be a shared priority for councils, developers and
  government. In the meantime, we are looking at practical solutions like
  reflective coatings and green infrastructure to help reduce overheating in
  tall buildings.” Additional reporting by Saranka Maheswaran and Andy Deng •

  reported ongoing heat issues.
