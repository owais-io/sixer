  TikTok workers in Germany are holding strikes over mass layoffs of the
  company’s trust and safety team. The social media behemoth said it is planning
  to dismantle its entire Berlin moderation team, which removes harmful content
  from the platform, and outsource the work to artificial intelligence and
  contract workers. This means the dismissal of 150 employees. The trade union
  that represents the TikTok workers, ver.di, has been pushing to negotiate with
  TikTok over the past few weeks. Kalle Kunkel, a ver.di spokesperson for the
  Berlin-Brandenburg region, said the union sent a list of demands to TikTok
  regarding severance for the affected employees and an extension of the layoff
  notice period to one year. So far, he said, TikTok has refused to come to the
  table. “Basically, they said: ‘We don’t want to talk with you,’ so after that,
  we went on two strikes,” Kunkel said. “But they still don’t react to us.” The
  Berlin employees cover the German-speaking market, which the union says has
  about 32 million active users. TikTok has a handful of offices around the
  country, but the capital city serves as the biggest hub, with about 400
  employees overall. The layoffs of the trust and safety team there would
  constitute nearly a 40% reduction in force. Anna Sopel, a TikTok spokesperson,
  said the company’s proposed layoffs are to “streamline workflows and improve
  efficiency” and that “we remain fully committed to protecting the safety and
  integrity of our platform”. In Germany, as with other countries around the
  world, the trust and safety team is in charge of making sure the short-form
  videos published on the platform don’t contain harmful content or violate
  company policy. That means flagging videos for things like violence,
  pornography, misinformation and hate speech. The people working on this team
  review up to 1,000 videos per day, according to the union. This human work is
  often done in conjunction with AI. A global push to replace moderators with AI
  Over the past year, TikTok has been cutting trust and safety staff worldwide,
  often substituting those workers completely with automated systems. In
  September, the company fired its entire team of 300 content moderators in the
  Netherlands. In October, TikTok announced it would replace about 500 content
  moderation employees in Malaysia in favor of AI-powered moderation. This past
  February, Reuters reported that TikTok was laying off significant portions of
  its trust and safety teams across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
  The German layoffs come after TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified in a hearing
  before the US Congress in 2024 saying the company would increase spending on
  trust and safety. He pledged to spend more than $2bn on a team of more than
  40,000 people globally. Sopel, the spokesperson, said TikTok is investing
  another $2bn in trust and safety this year but did not respond to questions on
  how many employees the team now has worldwide. TikTok, which is owned by the
  Chinese company ByteDance, is facing a ban in the US unless it’s sold to a
  government-approved buyer, though Donald Trump has granted it multiple
  months-long reprieves from the ban. Other social media companies including
  Snap Inc, X and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, have also made cuts
  to their trust and safety teams over the past couple of years. In May, NPR
  revealed that Meta planned to replace 90% of employees working on its product
  reviews with AI, including those for trust and safety. Meta and X have also
  terminated their human factchecking programs in favor of notes by other users.
  “Replacing people tasked with ensuring that platforms are safe and
  rights-respecting for all users, including minors, is going to lead to more
  mistakes and more harmful experiences,” said Aliya Bhatia, a senior policy
  analyst at the non-profit Center for Democracy and Technology, who studies
  automated content moderation. Strikes and protests against AI replacement
  Outsourcing this work to AI is problematic, Kunkel said. Employees at TikTok
  have complained to the union that the company’s automated moderation system
  has classified videos that show things like a rainbow Pride flag as harmful
  content, which does not violate company policy. Conversely, employees said in
  union complaints, the AI can skip over actual inappropriate matter. “AI is not
  able to really identify problematic pictures or videos, especially when it
  comes to sophisticated content,” Kunkel said. The EU is more strict than other
  parts of the world when it comes to regulating tech platforms and content
  moderation. Under the Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, social media
  companies, including TikTok, are required to rigorously safeguard their
  platforms from harmful content or face large fines. TikTok says investing in
  AI-powered moderation means being able to more quickly remove violating
  content before it’s viewed by people on the social network. The company says
  the technology also helps reduce the volume of harmful videos that human
  moderators are obliged to review. While TikTok plans to lean more heavily on
  AI, it says it will still outsource some of Germany’s trust and safety work to
  contractors. Kunkel expressed qualms that these workers, who watch large
  amounts of graphic content daily, may not have access to in-house health and
  safety programs. TikTok Germany offers mental health resources, Kunkel said,
  but most outside contracting companies don’t. To put pressure on TikTok to
  bargain, the union organized two day-long strikes and protests in late July.
  Kathlen Eggerling, ver.di’s lead negotiator for the TikTok employees, said
  these actions were necessary to show the company the value of its staff. After
  the first strike, TikTok employees received a stern warning. The company sent
  workers a message, seen by the Guardian, that said those who protest during
  work hours must notify their bosses in advance and request leave. TikTok said
  in the message that it was reviewing the situation with its legal team and
  would reach out to workers individually to address violations. Under German
  law, however, unions announce the strikes and workers are not required to
  inform their employer if they plan to participate. “It seems TikTok may need
  content moderators to factcheck its internal communications as well. We call
  on management to stop intimidating strikers,” Eggerling said. “Instead of
  spreading misinformation, TikTok should finally come to the negotiating
  table.” The union said TikTok employees will continue to rally. And if the
  company doesn’t meet them at the bargaining table, a longer term strike could
  be in the works.
