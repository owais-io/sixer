  Donald Trump has said he will issue an executive order to mandate
  identification for all US elections, a move likely to be challenged in court
  as unconstitutional. “Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO
  EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!,” the US
  president said on Truth Social late on Saturday. Trump also claimed he wants
  to ban all voting by mail except for those who are very ill or in military
  service. The US constitution grants primary authority to regulate elections to
  the US states, while empowering Congress to enact election laws or
  regulations. It gives no explicit authority to the president to regulate
  voting. The voting reform push by Trump stems from baseless claims that the
  2020 election he lost was stolen from him. Earlier this month, Trump falsely
  claimed only the US uses mail-in voting. Dozens of countries permit at least
  some form of mail-in voting. Trump himself has cast election ballots by mail.
  In the 2024 elections, 14 states and Washington DC had voter turnout by mail
  exceeding 30%, with Trump winning half of those states, including Utah, which
  had 91.5% vote by mail turnout and whose elections are overseen by
  Republicans. Some 36 US states have laws requesting or requiring voters to
  show identification at the polls, with the remaining states and DC using other
  forms of identity verification. Voter fraud is incredibly rare and voter ID
  laws have been shown to disproportionately impact minorities, low-income
  individuals and disabled voters. “As many as 11 percent of eligible voters do
  not have the kind of ID that is required by states with strict ID
  requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors, minorities,
  people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the Brennan Center
  for Justice states. A previous attempt by Trump to require proof of
  citizenship to vote was blocked by a federal judge in June 2025, as the law
  risked disenfranchising millions of Americans who don’t have passports, may
  not have easy access to birth certificates, and millions of married women with
  name changes may not have citizenship documents with their current legal name.
  Enforcement would likely affect tens of millions of Americans every election
  cycle who vote for the first time or update their voter registration
  information. Some 146 million American citizens do not have a US passport.
