  A Roman Catholic priest in Alabama is under investigation, church officials
  say – and he abruptly announced he is taking “personal leave” – after a woman
  alleged to his superiors that he traded financial support for “private
  companionship” including sex, beginning when she was 17. The accuser, Heather
  Jones, has also alleged that the clergyman, Robert Sullivan, recently paid her
  hundreds of thousands of dollars to remain silent about it, a claim she
  supported with bank records, an email and a copy of a legal agreement. Jones,
  33, provided the Guardian with a formal written statement that contained her
  allegations against Sullivan, 61, and which she provided to the diocese of
  Birmingham. She said she came forward because Sullivan had continued working
  closely with families and their children as the pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows
  church in Homewood, Alabama, leaving her fearful that “others may be
  vulnerable to the same type of manipulation and exploitation” she says she
  endured. Jones gave permission to be publicly identified by name, saying she
  hoped it would boost the credibility of her account. Birmingham diocese
  spokesperson Donald Carson said on Tuesday that the allegations against
  Sullivan were under investigation by an independent review board advising the
  local church. As was its protocol, Carson said, the diocese had forwarded the
  allegations to the Vatican entity which investigates cases of clergy
  misconduct. And Carson said Sullivan would be prohibited from public ministry
  until the resolution of the allegations against him. Voicemails the diocese
  left with Jones – and which she shared with the Guardian – offered her free
  therapeutic counseling. It was not immediately clear how much scrutiny
  Sullivan might draw from lay authorities. Carson said the diocese had reported
  Sullivan to the Alabama state agency that investigates child abuse cases
  because of the age Jones said she was when she met him. But officials at
  Alabama’s department of human resources had said the case did not fit the
  criteria of one in which they could get involved. Law enforcement
  investigators have been reluctant to act in some cases of religious clergy
  accused of having sexual contact with teens who had reached the legal age of
  consent, which in Alabama is 16. Furthermore, Alabama is not among the US
  states with laws that say it is impossible for there to be consensual sexual
  relationships between clergy and legal adults who are under the clerics’
  spiritual guidance. Sullivan could, however, face consequences within the
  Catholic church. Canon law to which clergymen are subject has considered
  people younger than 18 to be minors – and sexual contact with them to be
  abusive – since the early 2000s, when the worldwide Catholic church
  implemented reforms amid the fallout of a decades-old clerical molestation
  scandal. Multiple attempts by the Guardian to contact Sullivan for comment
  were not successful Tuesday. As she wrote in her statement to the diocese in
  late July and recounted to the Guardian more recently, Jones grew up in foster
  care after being removed from her mother’s custody “due to severe neglect”.
  She wrote that she lacked “consistent adult support” during her upbringing,
  leaving her ill-equipped to maintain employment or pursue a formal education –
  so she tried to make ends meet by working as a dancer at an “adult
  establishment” outside Birmingham. Jones said she was 17 when she met Sullivan
  at that establishment, which let her work there despite being under an
  applicable age limit. He was a regular patron, tipped her during her shifts
  and soon offered to “help change [her] life” if she called him on his phone
  number, she wrote. Sullivan proposed “to form an ongoing relationship that
  would include financial support in exchange for private companionship”, wrote
  Jones, who told the Guardian that the term encompassed sex. Jones said
  Sullivan subsequently began taking her shopping, dining, drinking, and to
  hotel rooms in at least six different Alabama cities in part to engage in sex
  – beginning when she was 17 and over the course of several years. Jones wrote
  that she “was a minor with no experience navigating adult relationships” when
  she met Sullivan. She wrote: “I was hesitant but ultimately agreed due to his
  persistence and the state [of mind] I was in.” Jones said Sullivan bought her
  a phone on which he frequently contacted her. He initially presented himself
  as a “doctor”, though she later learned he was a priest while his brother was
  a physician, she said. She wrote in her statement that discovering Sullivan
  belonged to the Catholic priesthood – whose members promise to be abstinent
  and teach that sex out of wedlock is sinful – was disturbing because she had
  attended church services throughout her youth and had difficulty reconciling
  “his public role and private behavior”. Sullivan paid for Jones to attend a
  rehabilitation program after she experienced depression, emotional instability
  and addiction during their arrangement, she wrote. Jones wrote that Sullivan
  and an attorney representing him eventually had her sign a non-disclosure
  agreement in return for $273,000. She shared an unsigned copy of the NDA with
  the Guardian. She also provided a copy of a 27 March message from Sullivan’s
  Our Lady of Sorrows email address, which had the sentence: “Someone will be
  calling you to sign the NDA.” Four days after that email, bank records which
  she shared with the Guardian showed, Jones received a wire transfer of
  $136,500 from an account under the name of the attorney’s law office. She
  received another $136,500 wire transfer from the same law office account a day
  later, the bank records indicated. Separately, in more than 125 different
  transactions from 18 July 2024 to 26 March, a Venmo account under Sullivan’s
  name paid nearly $120,000 to Jones, according to a copy of records from the
  financial app that Jones shared with the Guardian. Jones said it was never
  clear whether Sullivan took that money out of his personal finances, and
  remembered wondering whether it possibly came from some other source. Jones
  said he gave her the Venmo money of his own accord to aid her in covering her
  living expenses. Jones recalled Sullivan telling her he was also happy to give
  her that money because he loved her – and so did Jesus Christ. Jones wrote
  that she later proposed to revise the NDA with Sullivan and requested $100,000
  more. She said the agreement “heavily favored his interests and offered no
  meaningful protection, healing or justice” for dealings with Sullivan she had
  come to regard as “exploitative and predatory”. Sullivan and his attorney
  ignored her, Jones wrote. She provided her statement to the Birmingham diocese
  a few days after writing it on 23 July. Jones said she was willing to share
  phone records and pictures which she contended would corroborate her version
  of events with church investigators if they sought the materials. At Our Lady
  of Sorrows’ 3 August mass, Sullivan told his congregants that Birmingham
  bishop Steven Raica had authorized him to take “personal leave” that he
  requested after “prayer and reflection”. “Please continue to remember me in
  your prayers – as I will do the same for you,” Sullivan said shortly before
  the conclusion of the mass. On 10 August, Birmingham diocese vicar general
  Kevin Bazzel told congregants that Raica had appointed him as Our Lady of
  Sorrows’ temporary administrator in Sullivan’s absence. Sullivan had in June
  celebrated the 32nd anniversary of his ordination into the priesthood. He had
  also served six years as president of Birmingham’s John Carroll Catholic high
  school and in 2023 was appointed director of its educational foundation, as
  the local Homewood Star newspaper previously reported. He announced his leave
  nearly four years after Raica had appointed him to serve as one of the
  diocese’s vicars general, a high-ranking administrative post. In 2020,
  Sullivan had appeared on the ABC show Good Morning America, in which he
  discussed recovering from Covid with a helping hand from his brother, an
  infectious diseases doctor. Jones said she recently began law school and
  defied the NDA mentioned in her statement about Sullivan to the Birmingham
  diocese – which has an estimated membership of roughly a quarter of a million
  Catholics – because she was confident it would not hold up in court. She also
  wrote that she considered it vital to speak out about Sullivan because “behind
  closed doors, his behavior toward me was not in alignment with the values he
  teaches”. Raica said Wednesday in a diocesan letter reported on by the Alabama
  news outlets AL.com and WBRC that Sullivan had “a presumption of innocence
  until proven otherwise” as the investigations pending against him progressed.
  Carson, the Birmingham diocese spokesperson, said the allegations against
  Sullivan were “unfortunate for all involved”. “We keep father … Sullivan and
  the woman who’s making the allegations here certainly in our prayers,” Carson
  said.
