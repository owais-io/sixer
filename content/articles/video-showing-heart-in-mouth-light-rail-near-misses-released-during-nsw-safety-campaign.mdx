  safety campaign

  A man is hauled off the tracks by his backpack at the last second. A hatchback
  appears out of nowhere. A mobility scooter zooms in front of a tram without
  slowing down. A food delivery rider is almost sideswiped by an 85-tonne
  behemoth. Officials have released video footage of near misses in New South
  Wales and urged pedestrians, riders and drivers to be more careful near the
  light rail network during Rail Safety Week. The campaign comes two months
  after a pedestrian died when struck by a tram on Sydney’s light rail – the
  second fatality in the city in two years. The NSW government on Sunday
  released video footage of “heart-in-mouth” moments showing light rail near
  misses in Sydney and Newcastle. Officials said there were more close calls on
  Parramatta’s light rail system – which opened at the end of 2024 – over the
  past 12 months than on any other line. People in western Sydney were still
  adjusting to the new mode of transport and its positioning on roadways, the
  government said. The NSW transport minister, John Graham, urged those near
  light rail tracks to stay alert and “follow the rules to ensure your own
  safety”. “These moments are hard to watch because in some cases there is just
  centimetres or milliseconds from the result being so much worse,” Graham said
  in a statement on Sunday. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It is the right
  time to remind people that light rail vehicles can’t deviate from their path
  and at 85 tonnes, when fully loaded, they take time to stop.” Police said the
  pedestrian who died in early June in Surry Hills was attempting to cross
  between a light rail vehicle’s first and second carriages before he was
  trapped beneath the tram. Paramedics treated him at the scene, but he died.
  The incident was eerily similar to an incident in 2023 when a teenage girl
  died after she was trapped underneath a tram in Sydney’s CBD. Police told the
  media at the time she had been trying to climb between two tram carriages. The
  incidents have prompted Sydney tram drivers to demand safety upgrades to
  prevent further injuries or deaths. In response, Transdev, the light rail’s
  private operator, said at the time there were “multiple safety measures in
  place” on light rail vehicles, including camera vision and yellow safety lines
  that helped prevent slipping and warned people of platform edges. Sydney has
  25km of light rail track, Parramatta 12km and Newcastle 3km. There have been
  10 fatalities and around 1,000 injuries on the national light rail network
  since 2016, according to data from the TrackSafe Foundation. A majority were
  in Melbourne, which has 250km of light rail tracks.
