  January 6 demonstrated that longstanding democracies can readily resist a
  disorganized effort at a coup. They are less equipped to withstand the
  normalization of exceptional measures: the use of federal agents to quell
  domestic protest, the staging of police raids on the homes of leaders’
  political opponents, the pretextual invocations of emergency powers. Each of
  these steps may seem temporary and targeted; they may even enjoy a thin patina
  of legality. But over time, a democratic order turns into what Ernst Fraenkel,
  a German-Jewish lawyer whose book The Dual State stands as one of the first
  and most perceptive examinations of Hitler’s regime, called a “prerogative
  state” – a government in which the executive “is released from all legal
  restraints and depends solely on the discretion of the persons wielding
  political power”. So let us be clear: Trump’s commandeering of control of the
  Washington DC police department was simply an opening salvo. While Americans
  were greeted with images of soldiers in combat gear, toting rifles and
  establishing roadblocks and checkpoints near the National Mall, Trump was
  already tasking defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, with creating “specialized
  units” of the national guard to be “specifically trained and equipped to deal
  with public order issues”. What are the politics behind this militarization of
  domestic policing? Trump says he alone has the will and resources to pacify
  the “killing field” of Chicago, but clearly his “crime fighting” justification
  is no more than a ruse. Statistics – that is, reality – tell us that the crime
  rate in Washington DC was at a 30-year low when Trump sent in the troops.
  Which is not to deny the rhetorical power of ruses. Installing soldiers in
  Democratic strongholds allows Trump to present himself as the protector of law
  and order, especially to Maga supporters who have been trained by rightwing
  news outlets to view the nation’s largest and most multiethnic metropolitan
  areas as dens of inequity and vice. Never mind that this is the president who
  pardoned members of the lawless mob that stormed the Capitol, fired career
  justice department prosecutors who worked to hold insurrectionists to account,
  and has installed in the department the likes of Jared Lane Wise, an insurgent
  who was charged with urging his fellow rioters to kill members of the police.
  Militarizing the police also serves Trump’s politics of intimidation. Here we
  can connect the deployment of troops on the National Mall to the FBI’s raid on
  John Bolton’s residences. Both are disturbing displays of the kind of force
  more familiar to a police state than to a constitutional democracy. The fact
  that both acts were formally legal – two federal magistrates signed off on the
  Bolton warrants, while several statutes specific to the District of Columbia
  authorized the president’s use of the national guard – makes them textbook
  examples of the kind of dictatorial creep that Fraenkel diagnosed. Deploying
  troops to police Chicago would, of course, represent a far more alarming and
  legally dubious exercise of executive power. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878,
  a post-Reconstruction law, essentially bars presidents from using troops as
  domestic police. But we would be naive to conclude that federal law provides
  an adequate safeguard against the consolidation of the prerogative state. The
  Insurrection Act carves out disturbing exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act,
  allowing the president, in cases of “rebellion”, to deploy the military to
  enforce federal law. Would a supreme court that has held that a president
  enjoys broad immunity from future prosecution for all “official acts”, no
  matter how nefarious, question a president’s determination of what constitutes
  a “rebellion”? While the appearance of troops on the streets of Chicago or New
  York may frighten marginalized communities from exercising their basic rights
  of free movement, it may also trigger an equally dangerous and predictable
  response. The specter of city streets patrolled by soldiers trained to fight
  enemy combatants, not US citizens, may well serve not to quell violence but to
  invite it. The prospect of protests turning ugly and violent is all too real.
  The deployment of troops, under the pretext of responding to an emergency,
  then works to create the very emergency that justifies an ever-greater
  deployment. The danger is this is precisely what the president wants. Why?
  Trump has already aggressively inserted himself in the battle over the 2026
  midterms, pushing Texas to further gerrymander its already gerrymandered
  districts; jesting that war may supply a justification for delaying elections;
  and pledging to issue an executive order ending mail-in ballots – while
  clearly lacking the authority to do so. What if he were to deploy troops to
  polling places on election day? In principle, a strong edifice of law
  explicitly bars such a deployment on election day, but imagine the president,
  in the wake of a series of violent protests, invokes the Insurrection Act to
  “safeguard” polling stations from domestic unrest? Now we have armed soldiers
  at polling stations, handling ballots, and “monitoring” the chain of custody –
  all done in the name of protecting democracy. Legally, such a deployment would
  stretch the Insurrection Act beyond recognition, but courts deliberate slowly;
  elections are decided in days. As Fraenkel noted, authoritarianism does not
  operate outside law; it manipulates law until legality and illegality are
  indistinguishable. Lawrence Douglas is a professor of law at Amherst College
