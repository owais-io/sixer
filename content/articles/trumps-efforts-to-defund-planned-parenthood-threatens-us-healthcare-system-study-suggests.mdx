  study suggests

  Planned Parenthood clinics treated people who rely on Medicaid at more than
  1.5m visits in 2024, new research published on Wednesday shows. But the
  reproductive health giant’s ability to treat those patients is now in jeopardy
  due to Republicans’ efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood by kicking it out
  of Medicaid. Donald Trump’s tax and spending package, passed in July, bans
  Planned Parenthood from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid, the US
  government’s insurance program for low-income people. After Planned Parenthood
  sued over the ban, a judge temporarily stopped it from taking effect. If the
  ban moves forward, experts warn that it could cripple the entirety of the US
  healthcare social safety net. “Planned Parenthood has filled a very important
  role in the reproductive healthcare safety net for people living on low
  incomes,” said Kari White, executive and scientific director at Resound
  Research for Reproductive Health. White was the lead author on the research
  paper released on Wednesday. “Other providers have counted on them to do so.
  They just don’t have the capacity to step in and fill the place that Planned
  Parenthood has had in the safety net.” In particular, White said, people will
  probably struggle to access contraception. After Texas started to ice Planned
  Parenthood out of its Medicaid program more than a decade ago, placements of
  contraceptive implants and IUDs – two of the most effective methods of birth
  control – fell by more than a third in counties that had a Planned Parenthood
  clinic. That indicated that those who had used Medicaid to obtain
  contraception at Planned Parenthood were no longer doing so. Provision of
  injectable contraceptives also fell; among people who used it, births covered
  by Medicaid rose by almost a third. Republicans have long sought to defund
  Planned Parenthood over the organization’s commitment to providing abortions.
  But Planned Parenthood does not rely on Medicaid to fund its abortion
  provision as it is already illegal to use federal dollars, including Medicaid,
  to pay for the vast majority of abortions. The 1.5m visits documented in
  Wednesday’s research paper, which was published in the medical journal Jama,
  only include visits for reasons other than abortion. More than 80 million
  people in the US use Medicaid, and 11% of female Medicaid beneficiaries who
  are between the ages of 15 and 49 and who receive family-planning services go
  to Planned Parenthood, according to an analysis by the non-profit KFF, which
  tracks healthcare policy. But defunding Planned Parenthood will probably hit
  blue states hardest, since they are home to larger numbers of Medicaid
  beneficiaries. About 50% of the people who visit Planned Parenthood of Orange
  and San Bernardino Counties, which operates clinics in California, use
  Medicaid in some way, experts told the Guardian. If the defunding moves
  forward, the affiliate would lose roughly $50m, or half of its budget. It
  already went without Medicaid reimbursements for about five weeks earlier this
  year. “It was a really stressful time for my staff. They have fees and bills
  to pay. And some of them probably were wondering if they would still have a
  job,” recalled Dr Janet Jacobson, the affiliate’s medical director and
  vice-president of clinical services. “It’s hard not to take federal
  legislation that basically comes out and names you and threatens you and tries
  to defund you personally.” Jacobson is particularly worried about the future
  of a program at Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties that
  screens about 100,000 patients annually for sexually transmitted infections.
  Between July 2024 and June 2025, the affiliate uncovered more than 1,500
  positive tests for syphilis, as well as almost 400 cases of trichomoniasis in
  pregnant women. Both STIs – which often do not have symptoms in their early
  stages – can have devastating consequences for pregnant women and their
  babies, such as preterm birth and birth defects. “They haven’t been able to
  ban abortion outright, so they’re trying to take away the money for services
  like cancer screening, STI testing, birth control, and essentially trying to
  shut us down that way so that we can’t provide abortion,” said Nichole
  Ramirez, senior vice-president of communication and donor relations at Planned
  Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties. “They’re taking away this
  vital care from mostly underserved communities. They’re willing to have an
  increase in STIs, have a potential increase in cancer rates so that they can
  try to get rid of abortion.”
