  Bambi: A Tale of Life in the Woods review – chilled-out, heartwarming baby
  deer drama
sectionName: Film

  This live-action adaptation of Bambi, a Life in the Woods, the original novel
  by Felix Salten, is not in the mould of Disney’s heavily augmented and even
  nightmarish CGI “live action”, but more like a nature documentary with a
  voiceover. It’s not dissimilar to those sentimental anthropomorphic shows that
  add narrative to footage of deer and rabbits. The story begins moments after
  Bambi’s birth, and he is adorable – all knock-kneed charm and massive eyes.
  The production wisely eschews the intricacies of dialogue, so the players
  express themselves much as silent actors. They get particular mileage out of a
  very knowing crow: its limited appearances recall the scene-stealing
  performances of a Judi Dench or Maggie Smith. A rabbit seems a little at sea
  in a key secondary role that requires more chemistry. Thumper’s shadow from
  the 1942 Disney cartoon is long. I suspect this rabbit was cast for looks, not
  acting chops. The target audience is no doubt younger children, but
  drug-addled students might like to add this one to the roster – it is
  extremely mellow. Apart, of course, from the Great Tragedy, which lands with
  bleak emotional punch worthy of Werner Herzog, as the narrator intones:
  “Sadness is a deep coldness on the inside, and he doesn’t know yet that it
  will last for ever.” Yikes. Perhaps this film is the movie equivalent of the
  beautiful wooden toys kids reject in favour of something loud and luminous.
  But for parents who can’t face another lurid cartoon, this is the (mostly)
  chilled-out alternative. • Bambi: A Tale of Life in the Woods is in UK and
  Irish cinemas from 15 August.
