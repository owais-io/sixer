  Campaigners have complained to the Home Office after it was revealed a
  councillor for Reform UK also works for the government department processing
  asylum and immigration claims. Paul Bean, who serves as a councillor for Crook
  ward at Durham county council, declared his day job as a civil servant at the
  Home Office in his register of interests. His role emerged after an
  investigation by the anti-extremism organisation Hope Not Hate. The group
  found posts criticising asylum seekers on a social media account they claim
  belongs to Bean. “I work as an asylum decision maker for the HO [Home Office]
  and I can tell you with authority that 93% of asylum seekers to the UK are men
  between 18 – 35 and 92% of them are refused asylum,” posts on the account
  read, adding: “The truth is the vast majority of asylum seekers are actually
  economic migrants abusing the asylum system.” According to statistics
  published a few days ago, almost half of asylum seekers win their cases, with
  more granted asylum after an appeal. Another post reads: “97% of asylum
  seekers are lying about persecution in their home countries and the other 3%
  have been credible to the point of being believable. Source: me. Guess what
  job I do.” The civil service code states that all civil servants should be
  politically impartial. It says that civil servants must not “allow personal
  political views to determine any advice you give or your actions”. Other posts
  on the account use misogynistic language and are heavily critical of Reform,
  saying Nigel Farage has “submitted” to Islam and looks down on working-class
  people who give him power. Amanda Hopgood, the leader of the opposition at
  Durham county council, said: “It’s only right and proper that this issue is
  looked into in the interests of openness and transparency. I welcome the fact
  that the Home Office is looking into this.” Bean was one of 65 Reform UK
  councillors elected in May to Durham county council, giving the party a large
  majority and a larger number of councillors than the other parties – Liberal
  Democrats, Greens, Independents, Labour and Conservatives – put together. The
  council was previously run as a coalition between the Liberal Democrats,
  Conservatives and Independents. The former GB News presenter Darren Grimes is
  now a Reform UK councillor at Durham county council, holding the position of
  deputy leader. Reform UK’s latest policy announcement is for mass deportation
  of asylum seekers back to conflict zones such as Eritrea and Afghanistan, a
  plan Labour has called “pie in the sky”. A Home Office spokesperson said:
  “While it is our longstanding policy not to comment on individual cases, all
  civil servants must adhere to the civil service code, and are expected to
  carry out their role with integrity, honesty, objectivity and political
  impartiality. “Whenever the civil service code is breached, the matter will be
  fully investigated and disciplinary action taken as appropriate.” Paul Bean
  has been approached for comment.
