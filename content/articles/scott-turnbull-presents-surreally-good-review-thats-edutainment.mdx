  You can’t argue with the title: here is a weird, wonderfully warm morning show
  from illustrator and theatre-maker Scott Turnbull. Armed with an overhead
  projector and a stack of acetate sheets, he is our “edutainment tutor”,
  devoted to an anti-Gradgrind enterprise of spreading joy through facts.
  Today’s lesson plan: rising sea levels, youth clubs and, er, vampire bunnies.
  Today’s methods: limericks, songs, plinky-plonk music and lots of doodles,
  some done live. Audience contributions will be rewarded with badges. The
  result is considerably more “tainment” than “edu” as a family saga is conjured
  as a backstory. Pottering amiably among us, Turnbull combines our session with
  the proud yet recently turbulent history of the Tees Valley Projector Club,
  whose presidency has passed to Scott after his father’s recent death. There
  are sketches of his ancestors, including the great-great-grandmother whose
  (fully detachable) hand was sought by Beethoven and Brian “brother of Lord”
  Byron. A tale of pioneering lesbian scientists in a sea cave is followed by a
  portrait of a man with a leaf moustache, in turn followed by a Sonic
  Youth-referencing tale of a rabbit relocating from Los Angeles to Turnbull’s
  home of Stockton-on-Tees. And there are adverts for cigarettes. Made for
  babies. This makes a sometimes scattershot DIY hour, with a few misses among
  the hits, although the lines of Turnbull’s art are always appealing. The bunny
  opus is over-extended while the plot about his business’s takeover by a
  lugubriously voiced boss who threatens to shut down the show could use a
  slightly stronger conclusion. But it’s a lot of fun and our host has a lovely
  gentle presence, his childlike passion for art and storytelling accentuating
  the heartfelt tribute to his mum and dad. The final sequence is a tenderly
  rendered, wondrous folktale that would make a surreally superb sequel. • At
  Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
