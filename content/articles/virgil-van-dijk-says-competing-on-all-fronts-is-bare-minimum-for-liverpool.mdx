  Virgil van Dijk has reinforced Arne Slot’s desire for more silverware for the
  new season by insisting that retaining the Premier League title is “the bare
  minimum” for Liverpool. The champions will get a final tune-up for their
  defence when Sunday’s Community Shield pits them against Crystal Palace and
  the club’s captain was in a bullish mood in an interview on the club’s
  website. Slot has been busy strengthening a squad that won the league by 10
  points and Van Dijk says that after a spree of almost £300m on new players,
  there will be no lack of intensity when the season begins against Bournemouth
  on Friday. “You’re going into the season with goals that you want to compete
  for every trophy that you participate in. I think that’s the bare minimum for
  a club like Liverpool,” said Van Dijk. “It’s going to be very tough but we’ve
  been through very tough times anyway and I’m really looking forward to it. I’m
  looking forward to every bit of it. “We’re all in this together and that’s how
  it should be. Us as a group with players, staff but together with our fans, we
  have to go together into this and support each other and be there for each
  other in the good and lesser-good days.” Van Dijk spoke of his desire to leave
  a lasting impression at Anfield. “Any success with Liverpool, that feeling is
  incredible. That’s what you play football for. You want to be leaving a legacy
  behind, you want to be remembered, you want to inspire the next generation in
  everything you do. “We are at a club where legends will be remembered and
  honoured and always be welcomed back. It’s an amazing feeling and an amazing
  feeling that we were part of that period of time, but we still are part of the
  club and want to be successful.” Van Dijk is – alongside teammates Mohamed
  Salah, Alexis Mac Allister and Florian Wirtz – included on the 2025 Ballon
  d’Or shortlist. Salah, last season’s Premier League player of the season and
  Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year, said: “Being a legend at
  a club, especially like Liverpool, is such a great thing. It shows you that
  you worked very hard and achieved things that are difficult for people to
  achieve. I’m grateful for something like that.” “It is nice if you can start
  the season with the chance of winning something,” Slot said. “Normally you
  have to play numerous games before you can win something. “If it’s the League
  Cup, FA Cup, let alone [the] Premier League or Champions League, normally you
  win something in the end of the season. Now we have a chance to win something
  in the beginning of the season.”
