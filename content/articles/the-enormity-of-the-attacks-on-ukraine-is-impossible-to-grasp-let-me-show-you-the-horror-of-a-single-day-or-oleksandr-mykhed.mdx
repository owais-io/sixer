  Day 1,254 of the invasion; 31 July 2025, Kyiv, 4.30am. The air-raid alarm
  started again just a moment ago. I wake up from the roar and rumble of
  rockets. It’s a sound that makes you want to flee in primeval terror. Time
  slows down. I roll over on the bed, embrace my girlfriend Dasha, make another
  half-turn and we drop down softly to the floor. I am not thinking or
  reflecting, I’m guided by instinct – move away from the windows, position our
  silhouettes as low as possible. I cover Dasha with my body. All she has time
  to ask for is: “The doggie? Where’s the dog?” From under the bed, we can hear
  the rustling of our old chihuahua’s paws. Five Iskander-K cruise missiles are
  falling from the sky. One after another. Like gigantic knives, striking
  between the ribs of the city. A deadly force that cannot be stopped. The
  sounds of explosions are coming from different parts of the city, enveloping
  us in total helplessness. There is no hiding from this. Two hours before the
  shelling, I laid out my clothes and placed my emergency bag in the hallway.
  Just in case. It was not a rational decision based, for example, on warnings
  from analytical groups. But you can feel the shelling coming. It will happen
  today or tomorrow. Thousands of little Russians, who “have no influence over
  anything”, and will repeat at the tribunals the convenient narrative that this
  is “Putin’s war”, have already manufactured new Shahed drones and missiles.
  According to Russia’s new tactics, every night it first sends hundreds of the
  drones to one or several Ukrainian cities, thus exhausting the air defences,
  destroying civilian infrastructure and terrorising civilians. And then Russian
  missiles fly right after them and finish off the city that is already bleeding
  out. On that day at the end of July, the all-clear siren after the Shahed
  attack sounded at 3.18am, after four and a half hours of explosions. After the
  all-clear, Kyiv residents who had been hiding in shelters and the metro
  stations returned home to sleep off the exhausting night. Having waited for an
  hour and anticipating maximum losses, the Russians launched a missile attack
  on the slumbering city. In the fourth year of the invasion, I don’t know how
  to write about the shelling of my home town. Photos of destroyed buildings on
  social media no longer have the power to shock. The subject matter and angles
  of the photos have become ordinary. But if our empathy has indeed worn to the
  nub, why does it still hurt so much? It hurts because it feels as though the
  number of Russian shellings devalues the grief and loss associated with each
  attack. Russia’s actions reinforce the idea that this is now the new normality
  in Ukraine. I don’t know how to write about these attacks, but I know for sure
  that things have got worse. Statistics show that last year, during July 2024,
  Russia launched just over 400 drones over Ukraine. A year later, in July of
  this year, it launched more than 6,400 drones and missiles. Looking at the
  infographic that visualises this comparison and trying to comprehend the
  absurd figure of an increase of almost 1,380%, I am lost for words. Now there
  are so many Russian drones that they are dismantling the smallest components
  of infrastructure. It feels like if this were a game of Battleship they would
  have already destroyed the two-deck ships. And, of course, they are
  deliberately destroying residential high-rise buildings with civilians inside.
  We know exactly when the situation got worse: after Donald Trump came to
  power. For the Trump 2.0 world, an unsubstantiated promise of peace is already
  equivalent to peace. But the war did not stop for a moment. It got worse. The
  Ukrainian data journalism website Texty.org.ua analysed Russian missile and
  Shahed strikes on 12 frontline and neighbouring regions after Trump’s
  inauguration. Two months before, the Odesa region was struck twice; two months
  after, there were more than two dozen strikes. The UN reports that in June
  2025, Ukraine recorded the highest number of civilian casualties for three
  years – 232 people were killed and another 1,343 wounded. Civilians were
  killed or wounded in Kyiv and at least 16 other regions. In the first half of
  2025, the total number of civilians killed and injured was 6,754: 54% more
  than in the same period of the last year. And the same thing is happening on
  the ground, where the infantry is digging in. Where the frontline is.
  According to the DeepState monitoring group, which analyses changes on the
  frontline, Russia has taken almost 1,300 sq km of Ukrainian territory in the
  first five months of this year. In June alone, it secured a hold over 556 sq
  km of Ukrainian territory. How much is that? Imagine that in six months the
  Russians captured an area larger than Greater London. Or in June alone they
  took over the territory equivalent to five Parises. The Trump administration
  has brought Russia back to the table, initiating talks with a terrorist
  country. But in Russia’s eyes, the west in general and Trump in particular
  constantly demonstrate weakness. The Kremlin understands only strength, and if
  its political opponents are unable to implement any of their threats, Russia
  will expand its political, economic and informational foothold. And its
  strategic communications – missiles and Shaheds – will speak for themselves.
  On that single day in July, Russia launched 309 Shahed drones and eight cruise
  missiles. Of these, 288 Shahed drones and three Iskander-K missiles were shot
  down. I don’t know how to describe this barrage of explosions: 21 Shahed
  strikes in 12 locations, debris from the downed missiles in 19 locations. I
  don’t know how to describe the tachycardia that begins with the first
  explosion and has the heart drowning in this frantic rhythm for hours. There
  were 159 wounded, including 16 children. I don’t know how to find the words to
  describe what we seem to have seen hundreds of times, but every time it hurts
  like never before. Thirty-one killed: five children, the youngest just two. My
  friend posts a black-and-white photo of 42-year-old IT specialist Vitaly, who
  was killed alongside his 18-year-old daughter Vlada and dog Spike. Iryna, a
  mother, and her two daughters, ninth-grader Anastasia and sixth-grader Alina,
  were killed. Preschool teacher Natalia died along with her two sons, aged 17
  and 22, and her brother. Six-year-old Matviy, who had been doing karate for a
  year and a half, was also killed. Our lives have long since turned into an
  endless news feed of these losses. Our memory is trying to record the names
  and facts, but our consciousness is a black lump of pain. This is just a part
  of what Russia is striving for, that “No one should be left alive in Ukraine.”
  The 31 July shelling was preceded by a week of torrential rain – loud
  thunderstorms and bright lightning, the likes of which I had never seen
  before, and with every flash in the skies I felt my body twist in preparation
  for the strike. And then I realised that this is the state of war in which our
  bodies and consciousness function. They are trying to adapt, to survive and to
  prepare for the next strike. To survive it all, but at what shattered cost?
