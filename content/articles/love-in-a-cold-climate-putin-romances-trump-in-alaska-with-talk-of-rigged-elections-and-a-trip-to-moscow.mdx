  That was the moment he knew it was true love. Donald Trump turned to gaze at
  Vladimir Putin as the Russian president publicly endorsed his view that, had
  Trump been president instead of Joe Biden, the war in Ukraine would never have
  happened. “Today President Trump was saying that if he was president back
  then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be so,”
  Putin said. “I can confirm that.” Vladimir, you complete me, Trump might have
  replied. To hell with all those Democrats, democrats, wokesters, fake news
  reporters and factcheckers. Here is a man who speaks my authoritarian
  alternative facts language. The damned doubters had been worried about
  Friday’s big summit at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era airbase
  under a big sky and picturesque mountains on the outskirts of Anchorage,
  Alaska. They feared that it might resemble Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement
  of Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938, or Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and
  Joseph Stalin carving up the world for the great powers at the Yalta
  Conference in 1945. It was worse than that. Trump, 79, purportedly the most
  powerful man in the world, literally rolled out the red carpet for a Russian
  dictator indicted for alleged war crimes over the abduction and transfer of
  thousands of Ukrainian children. Putin’s troops have also been accused of
  indiscriminate murder, rape and torture on an appalling scale. In more than
  100 countries, the 72-year-old would have been arrested the moment he set foot
  on the tarmac. In America, he was treated to a spontaneous burst of applause
  from the waiting Trump, who gave him a long, lingering handshake and a ride in
  “the Beast”, the presidential limousine. Putin could be seen cackling on the
  back seat, looking like the cat who got the cream. As a former KGB man, did he
  leave behind a bug or two? Three hours later, the men walked on stage for an
  anticlimactic 12-minute press conference against a blue backdrop printed with
  the words “Pursuing peace”. Putin is reportedly 170cm (5.7ft) tall, while
  Trump is 190cm (6.3ft), yet the Russian seemed be the dominant figure.
  Curiously, given that the US was hosting, Putin was allowed to speak first,
  which gave him the opportunity to frame the narrative. More curiously still,
  the deferential Trump spoke for less time than his counterpart, though he did
  slip in a compliment: “I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with President
  Putin – with Vladimir.” The low-energy Trump declined to take any questions
  from reporters – a rare thing indeed for the attention monster and wizard of
  “the weave” – and shed little light on the prospect of a ceasefire in Ukraine.
  Perhaps he wanted to give his old pals at Fox News the exclusive. Having
  snubbed the world’s media, Trump promptly sat down and spilled the beans –
  well, a few of them – to host Sean Hannity, a cheerleader who has even spoken
  at a Trump rally. The president revealed: “Vladimir Putin said something – one
  of the most interesting things. He said: ‘Your election was rigged because you
  have mail-in voting … No country has mail-in voting. It’s impossible to have
  mail-in voting and have honest elections.’ “And he said that to me because we
  talked about 2020. He said: ‘You won that election by so much and that’s how
  we got here.’ He said: ‘And if you would have won, we wouldn’t have had a war.
  You’d have all these millions of people alive now instead of dead. And he
  said: ‘You lost it because of mail-in voting. It was a rigged election.’” In
  other words, the leader of one of the world’s oldest democracies was taking
  advice from a man who won last year’s Russian election with more than 87% of
  the vote and changed the constitution so he can stay in power until 2036. In
  this warped retelling of history, the insurrectionists of January 6 were
  actually trying to stop a war. Evidently Putin knows that whispering Trump’s
  favourite lies into his ear is the way to his heart. It worked. The Russian
  leader, visiting the United States for the first time in a decade, got his
  wish of being welcomed back on the world stage and made to look the equal of
  the US president. He could also go home reassured that, despite a recent rough
  patch, and despite Trump’s brief bromance with Elon Musk, he loves you yeah,
  yeah, yeah. “Next time in Moscow,” he told Trump in English. “Oh, that’s an
  interesting one,” the US president responded. “I’ll get a little heat on that
  one, but I could see it possibly happening.” Trump’s humiliation was complete.
  But all was not lost. At least no one was talking about Jeffrey Epstein or the
  price of vegetables.
