  EU citizens waiting for the Home Office to decide their pre-Brexit residency
  status should not be removed from the UK if they make a short return visit
  abroad for business, leisure or family matters, the statutory body for EU
  citizens’ rights has said. The Independent Monitoring Authority for Citizens’
  Rights Agreements (IMA) has written to the Home Office to express “serious
  concerns” about the difficulties applicants on the waiting list face if they
  leave the country. Some have gone home to visit relatives, others have gone on
  holiday but found they were refused entry on return. The IMA said on Monday
  that citizens who held a valid “certificate of application” (CoA), issued by
  the Home Office, could use their document to present to border force officials
  at airports or ports to show they had the right to travel. “The IMA’s position
  is that citizens who hold a valid CoA have the right to leave and re-enter the
  UK, subject to meeting relevant requirements,” it said in a statement. The
  position taken by the IMA is cold comfort for EU citizens already deported,
  including a 34-year-old Spanish woman who was detained overnight and removed
  from the UK despite presenting Home Office documents showing her right to live
  and work in the UK. Maria, not her real name, had been living in the UK with
  her British husband and had flown back to Spain to see her sister and her new
  baby at Christmas but was detained at Luton airport and removed on her return
  a few days later, leaving her life and job behind her. Another EU citizen,
  Greek Cypriot Costa Koushiappis was forcibly removed after he arrived back to
  Scotland from a short trip to Amsterdam in November. Unlike Maria, the
  Edinburgh border officials allowed him three days to sort out his tenancy and
  his job with his employer, Stuart West-Gray, who described him as a “star”
  employee at his Scottish motorcycle firm. The IMA chief executive, Miranda
  Biddle, said: “Our position is that a citizen with a valid certificate of
  application has a right to exit and enter the UK while waiting for a decision
  on their EU settlement scheme application, subject to providing additional
  documentation required at the border.” The IMA has written previously to the
  Home Office to seek clarification of its position as it considers the guidance
  given to border officials unclear. Biddles said the IMA was “keen to continue
  to work with the government” so as to “ensure citizens are not discouraged
  from exercising their rights”. It said it was particularly concerned that the
  Home Office clarify the rules on CoA travel rights before the new system
  requiring visitors to the UK to have an ”electronic travel authorisations” are
  enforced. This is because CoA holders are not eligible for an ETA but are also
  not exempt from needing an ETA or visa and will therefore need to demonstrate
  permission to travel to the UK. The grassroots campaign group the3million said
  it was “very disappointed” with the IMA as it was effectively agreeing with
  the Border Force approach of asking EU citizens to carry documents to prove
  their residence before Brexit on 31 December 2020, which the group said was
  not their job. A CoA was sufficient proof of rights until such time as a final
  decision is taken, the group said. The Home Office said it would respond to
  the IMA in due course. A spokesperson said: “All individuals with a
  certificate of application are made aware that they may be asked for evidence
  to show that they qualify under the scheme before they are allowed entry to
  the UK. Equivalent guidance has been issued to Border Force officers and
  published online.”
