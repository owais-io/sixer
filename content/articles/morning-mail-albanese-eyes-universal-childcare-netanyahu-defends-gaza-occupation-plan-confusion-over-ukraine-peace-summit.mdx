  Good morning. The government has got the ball rolling on the creation of a
  universal childcare system – a policy that could be central to Anthony
  Albanese’s political legacy. Elsewhere, Benjamin Netanyahu has defended
  Israel’s plans to occupy Gaza City, despite warnings from an emergency session
  of the UN security council about a further humanitarian calamity. In other
  international news, Ukraine’s allies have called for Kyiv to have a seat at
  the table as Trump and Putin prepare for talks. Closer to home, experts are
  convinced the RBA will cut interest rates this week as Australians continue to
  endure cost-of-living pressures. Australia Rates expectation | Economists and
  financial markets are (again) convinced the RBA board is about to drop the
  official cash rate from 3.85% to 3.6%, after the central bank held rates
  steady last month. Exclusive | Labor has commissioned consultancy giant
  Deloitte to help design a universal childcare system in Australia, as Anthony
  Albanese chases a political legacy to rival Medicare. Explainer | Before the
  Australian election, both main parties wanted to cut international student
  numbers. So why has the government announced that it will increase places by
  25,000 next year? Israel sales | The acting PM, Richard Marles, was adamant on
  Sunday that Australia is not selling weapons to Israel despite exports of F-35
  fighter jet parts – but critics say parts of weapons are still weapons. ‘Hard
  to watch’ | Officials have released startling footage of “heart-in-mouth” near
  misses in traffic in NSW and urged people to be more careful near the light
  rail network during Rail Safety week. World Gaza crisis | Benjamin Netanyahu
  has defended his Gaza City takeover plan as the “speediest way” to end the war
  with Hamas but the UN warns of “calamity”; UN experts say Gaza faces
  “starvation, pure and simple” as child deaths mount. Russia-Ukraine war |
  Europe’s leaders are increasing pressure on Donald Trump to involve Ukraine in
  talks with Putin; and confusion over the Alaska summit shows Vladimir Putin
  still calls the shots, Shaun Walker writes. European blazes | Wildfires have
  forced the closure of trails on Mount Vesuvius in Italy, while those working
  to contain France’s biggest wildfire since 1949 face a “challenging day” in
  soaring heat. ‘A lot of money to be made’ | A spate of robberies of luxury
  handbags in Paris suggests that high-value leather goods are now a bigger
  target for organised criminals than jewels or cash. ‘I’ll get back to you’ |
  Emma Thompson has accepted Academy Awards, Baftas and even a damehood, but
  there was one offer she had to turn down – a date with Donald Trump. Full
  Story Why doesn’t Adani pay any corporate tax? When Adani first sought
  government approval for its Carmichael coalmine in Queensland, a big selling
