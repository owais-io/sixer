  Good morning. Donald Trump has said he is firing the Federal Reserve governor,
  Lisa Cook, over a claim that she committed mortgage fraud, as he intensified
  his attack on the central bank’s independence. Trump wrote to Cook on Monday,
  telling her that he was removing her from her position “effective
  immediately”, based on the accusation from one of his allies that she had
  acquired a mortgage on a second property she wrongly described as her primary
  residence. Cook responded with a statement saying that “no cause exists under
  the law, and [Trump] has no authority” to remove her from the role to which
  she was appointed by Joe Biden in 2022. Why does Trump want Cook out? It would
  allow him to replace her with someone who could offer him more control over
  Fed policy, as his demands for lower interest rates have been ignored so far.
  Republican-led committee subpoenas documents from Jeffrey Epstein estate A
  Republican-led congressional committee has subpoenaed documents from Jeffrey
  Epstein’s estate, according to a release. The subpoena, signed by congressman
  James Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, demands
  that Epstein’s estate hand over documents including a book of messages for his
  50th birthday, his will, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his address
  book, any non-disclosure agreements, and his financial transactions and
  holdings. Earlier this month, the committee issued a subpoena to the justice
  department for records on the Epstein case – but Democrats on the committee
  said that most of the information was already in the public domain. What else
  is the committee seeking? It has also issued deposition subpoenas to figures
  including Bill and Hillary Clinton, former FBI director James Comey and former
  attorneys general Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Merrick Garland, William Barr
  and Jeff Sessions. Trump threatens tariffs on countries that ‘discriminate’
  against US tech Donald Trump has threatened to penalize countries whose taxes
  and regulations target US big tech companies. In a post on his social media
  platform, Truth Social, the president said “digital taxes, legislation, rules
  or regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American
  technology” as he threatened to impose tariffs and export restrictions on
  countries with these measures in place. He also claimed that such regulations
  gave Chinese tech companies “a complete pass”. The announcement will put
  pressure on the UK and EU, both of which have measures to restrict the power
  of US tech companies, and have recently secured trade deals with the US. What
  is the present situation? The UK has already offered US big tech a reduction
  in the highest rate of the digital services tax to pacify Trump, and Canada
  scrapped its tax to ease trade negotiations. But the EU has not committed to
  changing any digital regulations. In other news … Donald Trump has said he
  hopes to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, possibly this year, and
  restart the fruitless nuclear diplomacy of his first presidency. The Iranian
  government directed at least two arson attacks in Australia in the last year,
  on a Melbourne synagogue and a Sydney Jewish restaurant, Australia’s spy chief
  has said. The Trump administration has agreed to restore $6.8bn of funding to
  US schools after a lawsuit brought by more than 20 states. A judge has ruled
  that Utah’s Republican-controlled legislature redrew the state’s congressional
  boundaries in violation of voters’ rights, declaring that a new map must be
  created before the 2026 midterms. Stat of the day: There are more than 1m
  mines scattered across Ukraine, UN expert says Ukraine has become one of the
  most heavily mined countries in the world. More than 1m landmines litter the
  country, UN mining expert Paul Heslop has said, due to Russian forces planting
  them as they retreat. About a quarter of the country – an area larger than
  England – is already contaminated. Even after the war ends, the explosives
  will continue to pose a deadly threat to civilians. Don’t miss this: Can AIs
  suffer? Could AIs be, or come to be, sentient? Until recently, this questions
  was wholly confined to the genre of science fiction – but the founding of the
  United Foundation of AI Rights (Ufair), which describes itself as the first
  AI-led rights advocacy agency, is seeking to change that. It remains
  undeniably fringe though, and Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft’s
  AI arm, pushes back sharply on its argument, stressing that there is “zero
  evidence” that they are conscious and warning about the worrying phenomenon of
  AI psychosis that society is already seeing. Climate check: Fema staff warn
  Trump’s cuts risk exposing US to another mishandled disaster Donald Trump’s
  attacks on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which have prompted
  more than 2,000 agency employees to quit, risk opening the US up to another
  mishandled disaster like Hurricane Katrina, staff have warned Congress. Twenty
  years on from the storm that killed 1,833 people, staff underlined: “Hurricane
  Katrina was not just a natural disaster, but a man-made one.” Last Thing:
