  A new report has found hundreds of reported cases of human rights abuses in US
  immigration detention centers. The alleged abuses uncovered include deaths in
  custody, physical and sexual abuse of detainees, mistreatment of pregnant
  women and children, inadequate medical care, overcrowding and unsanitary
  living conditions, inadequate food and water, exposure to extreme
  temperatures, denial of access to attorneys, and child separation. The report,
  compiled by the office of Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat representing Georgia,
  noted it found 510 credible reports of human rights abuses since 20 January
  2025. His office team’s investigation is active and ongoing, the office said,
  and has accused the Department of Homeland Security of obstructing
  congressional oversight of the federal agency, which houses Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement (Ice). Ossoff said the government was limiting his team’s
  access to visit more detention sites and interview detainees. Under the second
  Trump administration, a Guardian analysis found average daily immigration
  arrests in June 2025 were up 268% compared with June 2024, with the majority
  of people arrested having no criminal convictions. And US immigration
  detention facilities are estimated to be over capacity by more than 13,500
  people. The problem is not new, as before Trump took office again, US
  immigration detention centers faced allegations of inhumane conditions. But
  controversy has ramped up amid the current administration’s widespread
  crackdown on immigration and undocumented communities within the US, including
  people who have lived and worked in the US for years or came in more recently
  under various legal programs that Trump has moved to shut down. Among the
  reports cited in the new file from Ossoff’s office, there are allegations of
  huge human rights abuses include 41 cases of physical and/or sexual abuse of
  detainees while in the custody of the DHS, including reports of detainees
  facing retaliation for reporting abuses. Examples include at least four 911
  emergency calls referencing sexual abuse at the South Texas Ice processing
  center since January. The report also cites 14 credible reports of pregnant
  women being mistreated in DHS custody, including a case of a pregnant woman
  being told to drink water in response to a request for medical attention, and
  another case where a partner of a woman in DHS custody reported the woman was
  pregnant and bled for days before DHS staff took her to a hospital, where she
  was left in a room alone to miscarry without water or medical assistance. The
  report cites 18 cases of children as young as two years old, including US
  citizens, facing mistreatment in DHS custody, including denying a 10-year-old
  US citizen recovering from brain surgery any follow-up medical attention and
  the detention of a four-year-old who was receiving treatment for metastatic
  cancer and was reportedly deported without the ability to consult a doctor.
  The report from Ossoff’s office was first reported by NBC News. The DHS
  assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to NBC News in response
  to the report: “any claim that there are subprime conditions at Ice detention
  centers are false.” She claimed all detainees in Ice custody received “proper
  meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers
  and their family members”. Meredyth Yoon, an immigration attorney and
  litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, told NBC
  News she met with the woman who miscarried, a 23-year-old Mexican national.
  “The detainee who miscarried described to Yoon witnessing and experiencing
  ‘horrific’ and ‘terrible conditions’, the attorney said, including allegations
  of overcrowding, people forced to sleep on the floor, inadequate access to
  nutrition and medical care, as well as abusive treatment by the guards, lack
  of information about their case and limited ability to contact their loved
  ones and legal support,” NBC News reported. DHS denied the allegations.
  “Regardless of our views on immigration policy, the American people do not
  support the abuse of detainees and prisoners … it’s more important than ever
  to shine a light on what’s happening behind bars and barbed wire, especially
  and most shockingly to children,” Ossoff said in a statement his office issued
  about the investigation.
