  Standup shows about losing a parent – “dead dad shows”, they get called – have
  become a genre unto themselves in recent times, and nowadays tend to arrive
  couched in self-awareness and alertness to cliche. No such irony attends Jena
  Friedman’s show about (among other things) the death of her mother, which –
  three years on from that event – is palpably raw and vulnerable. The parallels
  Friedman draws between loss of a parent and the decline of American democracy
  are lucid. But elsewhere her material on bereavement feels insufficiently
  processed and too painful, frankly, dissipating the energy of the
  42-year-old’s big-hitting opening half. The jaundiced tone of Motherf*cker is
  established from the off, as Friedman enters the stage flag-waving in a Maga
  cap to the strains – and it is a strain – of patriotic country music. “I look
  like a Republican’s wife,” she says, before launching one satirical
  hand-grenade after another, about abortion in the US, how the Democrats should
  have run Kamala Harris’s campaign, and how her unborn baby resembles Jeffrey
  Epstein. The in-your-face material is greeted variously with startled
  laughter, sometimes dazed silence (“you can’t rape a foetus”), and
  nonplussedness – see one routine sharing the home addresses of Republican
  lawmakers, which might be more worthwhile for an American audience. All this
  is just buildup to the tale of Friedman’s overlapping pregnancy and
  bereavement. She’s anxious about becoming a parent, turning to her mother for
  support – only for mum to be given a cancer diagnosis and weeks to live.
  There’s some meconium-black comedy on how these processes mirror one another
  (on her son’s difficult birth: “I didn’t want to leave my mum either”) and a
  could-be-fun closer about her mum intervening (or is she?) from beyond the
  grave. But their humour is undermined by Friedman’s emphasis on how damaged
  she was, and still is, by her loss. There’s some awkward crowdwork, too, which
  includes repeated apologies for the “gross” venue and her miming, apropos of
  not much, the mass-shooting of her audience. Motherf*cker makes an impact,
  politically and personally, but not always a comic one. • At Monkey Barrel at
