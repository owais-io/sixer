  The US health and human services (HHS) secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has
  fended off an attack by conservative firebrand and Donald Trump influencer
  Laura Loomer by issuing a statement of fealty to the president which calls it
  “a flat-out lie” that he is running for the White House in 2028. Kennedy, 71,
  had been under pressure since Loomer, 32, expressed concern in a recent
  Politico interview that Stefanie Spear, a top aide of the HHS secretary, was
  trying to “utilize her position to try to lay the groundwork for a 2028 RFK
  presidential run”. Loomer’s vigilante pressure campaigns within the White
  House have cost a number of Trump administration figures their jobs, including
  customs and border protection official Monte Hawkins as well as Food and Drug
  Administration vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad. Hawkins had been accused by
  Loomer of having an “anti-Trump, pro-open borders and pro-[diversity, equity
  and inclusion, or DEI] bias”. And she had labelled Prasad a “progressive
  leftist saboteur” before he was later reinstated by the White House chief of
  staff, Susie Wiles. Loomer told Politico that while she is realistic about
  neutralizing Kennedy, his deputies were vulnerable. “I’m not naive enough to
  think that the president is going to get rid of RFK, but I will say that …
  there are concerns about some of the staffing decisions over at HHS,” she
  remarked. A White House official told the outlet that they “would not be
  surprised if [Kennedy is] thinking about” running again after his 2024
  candidacy prior to aligning himself with Trump. But the official claimed they
  “don’t think anyone thinks it’s a real threat”. Kennedy responded on Friday,
  saying he would not strive for the presidency in 2028. The Kennedy family
  scion ran in 2024 for the Democratic party nomination before switching to
  become an independent candidate – and then cast his lot with Trump. Trump –
  who in the run-up to his second presidential election victory dismissed
  Kennedy as a “radical left liberal” – rewarded him with a cabinet level post
  as well as his “Make America healthy again” (Maha) mandate. “The swamp is in
  full panic mode,” Kennedy Jr said in an X post. “DC lobby shops are laboring
  fiercely to drive a wedge between President Trump and me, hoping to thwart our
  team from dismantling the status quo and advancing [the Maha] agenda.” Kennedy
  added that the so-called swamp, a Republican term for an entrenched Washington
  bureaucracy, was “pushing the flat-out lie that I’m running for president in
  2028”. “Let me be clear: I am not running for president in 2028,” he added.
  “My loyalty is to President Trump and the mission we’ve started.” And he
  defended Spear. He said “attacks on my staff, especially Stefanie Spear – a
  fierce, loyal warrior for Maha who proudly serves in the Trump administration
  and works every day to advance President Trump’s vision for a healthier,
  stronger America – are proof we’re over the target.” Kennedy also offered an
  overt expression of obeisance to his White House boss and political patron.
  “We’ll keep moving forward, we’ll keep delivering wins, and no smear campaign
  will stop us,” he wrote. In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that
  Kennedy was planning to remove all the members of an advisory panel that
  determines what preventive health measures insurers are obliged to cover,
  reportedly viewing them as too “woke”, a pejorative Republican term for
  progressive. The crossover of the administration’s anti-DEI campaign into
  healthcare came after an essay in the American Conservative magazine
  recommended the removal of taskforce members, saying it was embedded
  “left-wing ideological orthodoxy”. Among the points it raised was the
  taskforce’s use of term “pregnant persons” and mention of a “lasting
  psychological impact and stigma of enslaved Black women being forced to act as
  wet nurses”. HHS announced earlier in August it was halting $500m in mRNA
  vaccine research. And it has also moved to revive a taskforce on childhood
  vaccine safety, though vaccine injuries are known to be extremely rare. Known
  as “Trump’s Rasputin” in some circles, Loomer views Kennedy’s vaccine
  skepticism as surging from the left – and not in pure ideological terms. She
  disputes that he views the issue correctly as a rightwing one, though the two
  may act in confluence. She has previously labelled Kennedy, in the New York
  Times, as “a very problematic person” who “is running a shadow presidential
  campaign” from his office. “There’s been some things that have happened,”
  Loomer told Politico. “There’s been several things that have happened at HHS
  that are contradictory to the initial promises made.”
