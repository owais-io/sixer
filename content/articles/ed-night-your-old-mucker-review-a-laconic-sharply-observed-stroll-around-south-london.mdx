  ‘If there’s one thing this show doesn’t do, it’s come to you,” says Ed Night.
  That’s part of the charm – and possibly a slight failing – in the south London
  standup’s new set. As he treads around in a circle on his small stage, Your
  Old Mucker unfolds at its own laconic pace, and leaves us to make meaning out
  of its disparate parts. The 29-year-old’s authority, his sly standoffishness
  and playfulness with the art form are qualities of a standup near the top of
  his game – albeit one who with this ambling, endearing show doesn’t get quite
  as much out of them as he might. The conceit here is that Night’s writing
  process is, in fact, a walking one. The show traces his perambulations around
  his local neighbourhood, from the dentist to the butcher, from Nisa Local to
  the betting shop, connecting with friends and local characters along the way.
  Dotted throughout are references to his late grandad, whose eccentricities (a
  penchant for filling biscuit tins with not-biscuits; a circumcision in his
  80s) are to grandson Ed a wonder and inspiration. As for how these strands
  connect – well, I’d have liked the show to “come to me” just a little bit more
  in that regard. Given Night’s present-day story is prominently a tale of
  penniless, fragile young adulthood, dodging bills and drinking cheap coffee in
  chicken shops, maybe the parallel with his wartime forebear is there purely
  for bathos? Not that there’s anything heroic about grandad, if the audio clips
  of his left-field second world war memories (or lack thereof) are anything to
  go by. But if Your Old Mucker unfolds obliquely, it is studded with original
  thinking, great phrasemaking and big-hitting jokes – of which the guide-dog
  gags, a vision of Fortnum &amp; Mason as Dante’s hell and a routine on
  bargaining with his landlord for a lower rent are standouts. With a couple of
  later riffs (one on the Buddha; one on Steve Irwin) seemingly winched in from
  different shows entirely, the show may not hang together that tightly. But
  walking a mile in Night’s shoes is still, in this Edinburgh comedy
  award-nominated show, a wander well worth taking. • At Monkey Barrel, the
  Hive, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
