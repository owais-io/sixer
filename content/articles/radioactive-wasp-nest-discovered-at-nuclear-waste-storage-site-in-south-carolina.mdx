  The US Department of Energy has reported the discovery of a radioactive wasp
  nest at one of its facilities in South Carolina that was once involved in the
  production of parts for nuclear weapons. According to a 22 July department
  report, the contaminated nest was discovered at the facility – the Savannah
  River site – on 3 July near tanks used to store liquid nuclear waste. It said
  the nest was sprayed and was disposed of as radiological waste, and that
  testing confirmed radiation levels “greater than 10 times the total
  contamination values” that federal regulations allow. The contaminated wasp
  nest was the result of “onsite legacy radioactive contamination” and “not
  related to a loss of contamination control”, the Department of Energy stated
  in the report. “The ground and surrounded area did not have any
  contamination,” it said, concluding that no further action was required. Thee
  Savannah River Mission Completion, which oversees the site, confirmed to the
  local Aiken Standard newspaper that its radiological control staff discovered
  the test “while performing routine radiological monitoring activities”. It
  said the nest was sprayed and surveyed for contamination, according to
  procedure. “While no wasps were found on the nest, the individual insects
  would have significantly lower levels of contamination,” it said. “Upon
  discovery of the contaminated nest, the immediate area was secured and
  surveyed; no contamination was found in the area. There were no impacts to
  workers, the environment or the public.” It noted that the site is near the
  center of the 310-sq-mile site. “Generally, wasps travel only a few hundred
  yards from their nest,” it said. The executive director of the Savannah River
  Site Watch watchdog group, Tom Clements, told the Associated Press this week
  that he was “as mad as a hornet that SRS didn’t explain where the radioactive
  waste came from or if there is some kind of leak from the waste tanks that the
  public should be aware of”. According to the Department of Energy, the
  Savannah River site was built in the early 1950s and “focused on the
  production of plutonium and tritium for use in the manufacture of nuclear
  weapons from its inception in the early 1950s until the end of the Cold War”.
  In 1992, the facility began focusing instead on environmental cleanup, nuclear
  materials management, and research and development. The area where the nest
  was found – known as the “F-Area Tank Farm” – contains 22 underground carbon
  steel tanks, with each tank reportedly capable of holding 750,000 to 1.3m
  gallons (2.8m to 5m litres) of radioactive waste, according to the Aiken
  Standard.
