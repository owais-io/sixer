  ‘Chromaticism is a rare and exotic bloom in Western music,” writes Exaudi’s
  director James Weeks in his wonderfully comprehensive essay in his group’s
  disc of late 16th-century choral works. “It flowers only when conditions
  allow: when a harmonic theory exists which can accommodate it, and more
  importantly when composers desire to use it to increase the emotional
  expressiveness of their music.” Exaudi’s exploration of the power of
  chromaticism begins with the high renaissance settings of Orlando di Lasso –
  his motet Timor et Tremor and six of the cycle of 12 motets that make up his
  Prophetiae Sibyllarum. It then moves through settings of more unfamiliar
  composers such as Vicente Lusitano and Nicola Vicentino to end with Marenzio
  and Luzzaschi, whose madrigals – settings of Petrarch and a section of Dante’s
  Inferno respectively – seem to be poised on the cusp between the renaissance
  and the early baroque. It’s music that was composed in the same period as
  Gesualdo’s much better known madrigals, which sometimes use chromaticism and
  dissonance to even more spectacular effect. Yet the writhing, convoluted lines
  of these pieces, negotiated with exemplary precision and clarity by the seven
  singers of Exaudi, their voices perfectly matched and balanced, carry their
  own expressive power. This is a disc that becomes more fascinating and
  involving the more you listen to it.
