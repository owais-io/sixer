  Derk Sauer, who has died aged 72, was a Dutch media titan who helped
  facilitate the rise of Russian independent journalism, an institution that he
  fought to save even as all the others in his adopted country crumbled around
  him. His publications, the Moscow Times and Vedomosti, were powerhouses and
  proving grounds for many of the country’s leading Russian and foreign
  journalists, while glossies he published in Moscow, such as Cosmopolitan,
  pioneered that market and became, he would claim, a “bible for young women” in
  the newly emancipated Russia. As Russia sank deeper into authoritarianism,
  Sauer backed embattled media projects and then finally returned to the
  Netherlands after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But he provided safe
  harbour for dozens of the country’s independent journalists who were working
  in exile awaiting a safer time – likely after Vladimir Putin dies – when they
  might return home. He died at a family home in Domburg in the Netherlands as a
  result of injuries from a sailing accident. He had fallen down a stairwell on
  board his boat near Greece, which had struck an underwater rock, and underwent
  several operations before his death. Sauer arrived in the Soviet Union in 1989
  in a car with his wife, the journalist Ellen Verbeek, their seven-month-old
  son, and all the products they could carry (he would continue to ship in
  nappies and powdered milk from the Netherlands). His goal was to start a
  glossy magazine, but his local partners at the Russian Union of Journalists
  were “in fact old KGB guys”. Instead, he sought out “young journalists, real
  writers” through his only other contact, the music critic Artemy Troitsky, and
  established the short-lived Moscow Magazine, a plucky monthly that soon shut
  when the Dutch publisher lost interest. But Sauer would wistfully recall the
  “romantic” mood in Moscow where “the future was bright”, despite hardships
  such as waking up at 4am to queue for petrol or living in a flat with a fridge
  full of cockroaches. And the question of how foreigners could navigate Russian
  life ultimately led to his first major publication: the Moscow Times, an
  English-language daily newspaper that he established in the rooms of the
  Sloviansk hotel in 1992 in exchange for advertising the hotel’s services. That
  paper was the foundation of Sauer’s Independent Media, a company that got its
  big break with the rights to publish Cosmopolitan in 1994, co-founded the
  business daily Vedomosti in 1999, and was then sold in 2005 to the Finnish
  company Sanoma for a small fortune. The key to Sauer’s success, colleagues
  said, was his ability to navigate Russia’s red tape without succumbing to
  corruption, and a business acumen that could co-exist with his belief in
  quality journalism. “Any oligarch can buy our newspaper – at a kiosk,” read an
  early advertisement for Vedomosti, which was also backed by the publishers of
  the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal. “He was never corrupt, even when
  he was dealing with oligarchs, even when he was dealing with government
  people,” said Troitsky. Sauer brought the can-do attitude of his experience as
  a war correspondent to the tumultuous world of Russian publishing. He was born
  in Amsterdam, the son of Hendrik, a pension fund manager, and Evelien (nee
  Geuze-Tazelaar). Derk was a convinced communist from childhood (he called
  himself a “14-year-old Maoist”), and told his conservative parents that he was
  travelling to study in Dublin at the age of 19, but quickly crossed into
  Northern Ireland to report on the conflict for, among others, the Dutch
  broadcasting company VPRO. (His parents only found out when they heard him
  reporting from Belfast on the radio.) He later admitted to once having
  smuggled guns for the IRA, though he downplayed the incident later and
  disavowed any connection to the group. After Ireland he went on to report in
  Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, Nicaragua, El Salvador
  and Beirut, before he returned home and started a family with Verbeek. Bored
  in the Netherlands, he approached his wife in 1989 determined to have a new
  adventure. “Can’t we go to New York?” she asked, when he first pitched the
  move to Moscow. The Moscow Times chronicled a unique moment in Russian
  history, after the fall of the Soviet Union, when the paper’s young
  correspondents could freely enter a politician’s office or request sensitive
  documents. Sauer himself recalled walking into the KGB building and asking for
  the files on the Dutch communists, which he was readily given. “That was
  probably the most unbridled period of freedom of the press in history,” he
  mused. And then he added: “This could not last.” It didn’t. Journalists
  increasingly became targets for government crackdowns and gangland
  assassinations. Sauer and his family had bodyguards for nearly a decade after
  a would-be assassin shot and paralysed the editor-in-chief of Playboy – a
  title that Sauer owned – in 2001. And as Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin
  in 1999, Sauer already hinted at some discontent with the country’s direction.
  Writing in the newspaper Het Parool about a concert by the Scorpions that
  year, he considered organising a reunion with the same friends he had seen the
  group with in 1989. “But what would we talk about?” he wrote in a column. “The
  dirty war in Chechnya? The wealth that never came for most? The never realised
  dreams? The new walls that have been built in Europe?” In 2005, Sauer sold the
  Moscow Times and his other titles at the market’s peak, netting €142m. He
  remained in the media, eventually joining Russia’s RBC newspaper as publisher
  during a tumultuous period when it printed a series of explosive
  investigations, including one that identified Putin’s secret daughter as a
  senior Moscow State University official. The paper’s editor was replaced, and
  Sauer soon left. In 2017, he bought back his beloved Moscow Times, which he
  turned into a digital product and said would continue to “report stories that
  won’t make it to other outlets”. But times had changed and media outlets were
  increasingly under pressure from the Kremlin. “Only one thing can make me
  leave: the inability to express myself freely and do my job as a journalist
  and publisher,” Sauer had said in the mid-2010s. That time came in 2022 after
  the invasion of Ukraine. But as he left, he reached out to journalists from
  his publications and TV Rain, a leading independent television station, and
  invited them to move to his native Amsterdam. “Derk is the reason we are
  here,” said Mikhail Fishman, a television anchor and one of dozens of Russian
  journalists who were supported by Sauer. Sauer is survived by his wife, and
  their three children, Tom, Pjotr (a Guardian reporter) and Berend. • Derk
