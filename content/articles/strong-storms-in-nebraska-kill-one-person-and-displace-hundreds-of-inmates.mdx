  Strong storms in eastern Nebraska early Saturday killed one person, seriously
  injured another in a state park and displaced hundreds of inmates after two
  prison housing units were damaged, officials said – as other midwest US states
  also braced for bad weather. Meanwhile, more than 40 million Americans have
  been put on alert for dangerous heat and fire weather. In terms of fire
  weather, a blaze which prompted mandatory evacuations in two Colorado counties
  was of particular note. With respect to the Nebraska storms, the Waterloo
  volunteer fire department was called to Two Rivers state park just before 7am
  on Saturday, where first responders found a vehicle crushed by a large
  cottonwood tree. The tree had toppled as the storm brought gusts higher than
  80mph (129km/h) to the area, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).
  A woman in the vehicle was declared dead at the scene, while a man was trapped
  inside, the fire department said in a news release. It took firefighters about
  90 minutes to free the man because of the size and weight of the tree, the
  department said. Once free, the man was taken to an Omaha hospital with
  life-threatening injuries, the Waterloo fire chief, Travis Harlow, said. The
  state park – a popular camping spot – is about 5 miles (8km) west of Omaha’s
  western border. High winds caused widespread damage across eastern Nebraska,
  toppling trees, damaging roofs and pulling down electrical lines. Thousands of
  people were left without power in the immediate aftermath. In the state
  capital of Lincoln, the storms damaged two housing units at the Nebraska state
  penitentiary, displacing 387 prisoners, the state department of correctional
  services said in a statement. “There are no reported injuries, and all staff
  and incarcerated individuals are safe and accounted for,” the agency said.
  Strong storms also moved through parts of eastern Wisconsin on Saturday,
  bringing gusts of 60mph to the state’s Door Peninsula, the NWS said. Flood
  warnings were put in effect in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. And
  flash flooding forced the closure of parts of interstates 43, 41 and 94, the
  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The outlet added that all runways except
  one at Milwaukee’s Mitchell international airport were reported flooded at one
  point, along with most taxiways and an underpass tunnel. The weather service
  said more strong storms were possible across the nation’s midsection on
  Saturday night into Sunday, stretching from western Colorado into Kansas,
  Nebraska, Iowa, northern Missouri and into Illinois and Wisconsin. Meanwhile,
  grappling with extreme heat advisories was a region including Albuquerque, New
  Mexico; El Paso and Dallas, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Little Rock,
  Arkansas; Wichita, Kansas; Springfield, Missouri; and Kansas City, Missouri,
  as ABC News reported. And the network noted that places in Oregon, Utah,
  Colorado and Wyoming were put on alert for fire conditions. Notably, after the
  Lee wildfire in Colorado grew by nearly 30,000 acres, officials in Rio Blanco
  and Garfield counties ordered mandatory evacuations as flames raced south,
  according to the Denver Post. The earth’s ongoing climate crisis – fueled by
  human-caused greenhouse gas emissions – has been making extreme weather events
  more common, including strong storms, floods and wildfires. The Associated
  Press contributed reporting
