  Meteorologists in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands have announced this
  year’s north Atlantic winter storm names, chosen after 50,000 suggestions were
  submitted by the public. Amy, Bram and Chandra will be the first named storms
  of winter 2025-2026, the Met Office said on Monday. The Met Office, together
  with its partners Met Éireann and the Dutch national weather forecasting
  service, KNMI, began naming storms in 2015 to raise awareness and help people
  prepare for severe weather. The climate crisis is shifting weather patterns,
  intensifying wind-rain extremes in some parts of the UK, which are also
  becoming more susceptible to flooding. North Atlantic storms are named
  alphabetically, missing out Q, U, X, Y and Z. Name suggestions are submitted
  by the public, and factors considered by meteorologists in choosing a name
  include how difficult it is to pronounce, whether it has different meanings
  across the different countries, or could be controversial. Amy was the most
  popular female name submitted in the UK, while Dave was suggested in tribute
  to “my beloved husband who can snore three times louder than any storm”. Isla
  was the most popular name for I, with many submissions about little girls who
  “leave chaos in their wakes”, while Violet was submitted in honour of a
  daughter “every bit as fierce and unstoppable as a storm” after being born at
  27 weeks while her mother was unwell, the Met Office said. The choice of
  Stevie for S was inspired by a little girl named after Stevie Nicks of
  Fleetwood Mac for the band’s song Dreams, which includes the line: “Thunder
  only happens when it’s raining.” Pets also featured in the nominations, with
  one cat, Oscar, described as a “good boy, but crazy when he gets the zoomies”.
  The other storm names, running from early September, when the likelihood of
  low-pressure systems and the potential for storms severe enough to be named
  increases, are Eddie, Fionnuala, Gerard, Hannah, Janna, Kasia, Lilith, Marty,
  Nico, Patrick, Ruby, Tadhg, Violet and Wubbo. The north Atlantic naming group
  – the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands – name storms when they have the
  potential to cause medium to high impact across the three countries. Wind
  speed is the primary determinant, but the impact of rain and snow are also
  considered. In the past year, running from September to August, six storms
  were named, reaching the letter F with Storm Floris last month. January’s
  Storm Éowyn was one of the most severe to hit the UK and Ireland in the past
  decade, the Met Office said, with 100mph (160km/h) winds recorded. Three
  people died and there were widespread power cuts and damage across Ireland,
  Scotland and the Isle of Man. Rebekah Hicks, the deputy chief meteorologist at
  the Met Office, said: “Naming storms isn’t just about giving them a label,
  it’s about making sure people take notice. “When a storm has a name, it
  becomes easier for the media and public to talk about it, share information
  and prepare … It’s a simple step that can make a big difference.” Suggestions
  for storm names can be submitted at any time on the Met Office’s website.
