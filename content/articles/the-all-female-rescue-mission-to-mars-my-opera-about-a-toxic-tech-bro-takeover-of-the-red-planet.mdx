  Why write an opera about Mars? Because Mars isn’t just a planet. It’s a
  philosophy, an ideology. The way humans think about it changes over time,
  reflecting the unstable mix of assumptions, hopes, dreams and anxieties that
  define each historical moment. In 1965, Nasa’s Mariner 4 probe flew past Mars
  and beamed the first closeup images of the red planet (or of any other planet)
  back to Earth. Prior to that flight, humans knew the planet only through
  telescopes, and it was thought that its surface would feature vegetation and
  that life may have evolved there. Mariner 4 revealed the truth: it was a
  rocky, cratered place seemingly devoid of life. President Lyndon B Johnson
  declared that “it may just be that life as we know it, with its humanity, is
  more unique than many have thought, and we must remember this”. The New York
  Times went further: “Mars, it now appears, is a desolate world.” If like me
  you were not then born, try to imagine what it would have been like to be
  alive in that summer of 1965. In June, Ed White became the first US astronaut
  to perform a spacewalk. (The Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov had preceded him
  by just under three months.) White’s experience of the spacewalk was so deeply
  transcendent that he described re-entering the capsule as “the saddest moment
  of my life”. Life magazine devoted an issue to White’s “Glorious Walk in the
  Cosmos”: millions pored over the images. Only a few weeks later, Mariner 4’s
  images of Mars were broadcast on TV, showing its desolation. We started a
  summer floating in White’s cosmic bliss, believing that we might not be alone
  in the universe, only to end it with those hopes quashed. In another summer,
  60 years later, we are still immersed in news related to space and technology.
  Spring was already busy enough. April saw the launch of the first all-female
  spaceflight, led by Lauren Sánchez – the then fiancee, now wife, of
  billionaire Jeff Bezos – in a rocket made by Bezos’s aerospace company Blue
  Origin. In May, Elon Musk, another billionaire with an aerospace company,
  stepped down from running Doge while wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt. In
  June, the billionaire venture capitalist, seasteading enthusiast and early
  Trump adopter Peter Thiel gave an interview to the New York Times in which he
  declared: “Mars is supposed to be more than a science project. It’s … a
  political project.” In July, scientists at the National Astronomy Meeting
  announced evidence of 10,000 miles of ancient riverbeds in a part of Mars not
  previously thought to have featured water. Then Sotheby’s sold the largest
  Martian meteorite in existence to a private bidder for about $5.3m (nearly
  £4m) – and President Trump signed an executive order aimed at “preventing woke
  AI in the federal government”. Why write an opera about Mars? Because when we
  talk about Mars we are talking about ourselves – about our ideas of the
  future, and about the operations of power in the present. So, then, how to
  write an opera about Mars? You begin by choosing a librettist. The writer Mark
  O’Connell was the obvious choice. We both share an interest in technology, AI,
  Silicon Valley and a bundle of ideologies that may or may not be on the
  average person’s radar. These range from transhumanism and futurism through to
  pronatalism – a movement, increasingly popular in Silicon Valley, that
  advocates for improving fertility and increasing birthrates to address
  demographic decline in western countries. Our research was far-ranging, taking
  what might be termed a hard science-fiction approach. We started with mundane
  details. How do astronauts exercise? Eat? Shower? Poop? Is it possible for a
  pregnancy to be carried to term in zero gravity, or Martian gravity, which is
  38% of Earth’s? The answers range from the benign (using Ared, the advanced
  resistive exercise device) to the not so benign (one option is to strap the
  woman into a subterranean centrifuge throughout the pregnancy). The distance
  between Earth and Mars – approximately 140m miles – means that real-time
  communication is an impossibility. We wondered how human relationships would
  be conducted if conversations could only occur via voice note. Everything we
  researched led to more questions. How might our understanding of ourselves,
  and of the universe, be changed if we were to discover life on another planet?
  Would the legal framework outlined in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 work?
  Would humans be doomed to repeat the horrific logic of colonisation, or is
  another way possible? Our opera centres on an all-female mission. Four
  astronauts – Svetlana, Sally, Judith and Valentina, named after the first four
  women to go into space – are on their way to Mars aboard the spaceship
  Buckminster, with only Arabella, the onboard AI, for company. Their mission is
  to search for water to enable the development of the commune that has already
  been established there. The journey is long, and made more difficult by the
  fact that they only have Shrek the Third and a few seasons of The Real
  Housewives of Beverly Hills. As they prepare to land, they discover their
  mission has been the subject of a hostile takeover and that they now work for
  Shadowfax Ventures, a company helmed by libertarian billionaire Axel
  Parchment. They must now confront isolation, sinister ideologies, the prospect
  of alien life and a vibeshift toward corporate authoritarianism. As we staked
  out the plot, the next challenge for me was how to cover this broad territory
  sonically. I started by thinking about the actual sounds astronauts hear in
  the different environments they inhabit in space. The sonic overwhelm of a
  rocket launching; the whirr of fans inside the craft; the industrial clack and
  punch of machinery. I analysed recordings of the incredibly noisy ambient
  sounds of the different modules of the International Space Station (ISS), and
  figured out ways to orchestrate and re-create these sounds. I listened to
  hours and hours of space audio – whistles, auroral choruses, interstellar
  audio recordings made by Voyager 1, sonifications of the light curves of
  different exoplanets and Chris Hadfield’s recordings of the toilet on the ISS.
  I haunted the Space Exploration Stack Exchange, where the community helped me
  with questions about how a double bass bow might behave in 38% gravity, how a
  trumpet or violin might degrade in a Martian habitat. Astronauts seem to have
  a thing for synth music. A look through Dutch astronaut’s André Kuiper’s ISS
  playlist shows an interest in Vangelis, Mike Oldfield and Brian Eno. I placed
  synthesisers within the orchestra and also in the spaceship itself. And for
  our villain, a character Mark described in musical terms as “bad EDM”, I
  turned to AI. It seemed apt to fight like with like, and I prompted the system
  with genre descriptions like “bro step” and “fashwave”. In the opera, the
  astronauts resist the hostile takeover of the future in their own way, no
  matter the risk. However dystopian the imaginings of Mark and myself, for our
  astronauts there is ultimately resistance and hope, defiance and even the
  possibility of joy – all realised through collective action. As our team
  worked over the summer, aware of the very real human challenges and horrors
  outside our rehearsal room – in a world that seems to be increasingly
  controlled by a small number of incredibly rich individuals imposing their
  will on the rest of us – I was insistently reminded of the fact that it is
  through coming together that we Earthlings have power and meaning. • Mars is
  at Abbey theatre, Dublin, from 7 to 9 August
