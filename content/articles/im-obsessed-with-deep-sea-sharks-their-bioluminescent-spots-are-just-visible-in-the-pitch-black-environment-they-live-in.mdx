  I’m obsessed with deep sea sharks: their bioluminescent spots are just visible
  in the pitch black environment they live in

  Three years ago I was running a research project from a bottom trawler off
  Namibia about deep-sea sharks – all of which live under enormous water
  pressure, close to the seafloor and are rarely seen by humans. These sharks
  were being brought up in the trawler’s nets. By the time they were brought to
  the surface, they had experienced such a dramatic change in pressure that they
  had undergone barotrauma, so they were internally damaged and unlikely to
  survive. I am a marine biologist and my work on the trawler was to document
  what types of deep-sea shark the fishers were catching, accidentally, while
  fishing in waters between 200 and 450 metres deep. My Namibian colleague
  Filippus Tshimwandi and I recorded a number of deep-sea shark species that had
  not previously been thought to be anywhere near Namibia before. We recorded
  west African catsharks, which were mostly thought to be farther along the west
  African coast and a sawshark species. We also saw quite a lot of gulper
  sharks, which have huge emerald eyes and are among the most threatened shark
  species in the world. They are often targeted by other fisheries for their
  squalene, a compound made from the oil in their liver and widely used in
  manufacturing cosmetics. They were caught because bottom-trawl fisheries –
  even those that want to be sustainable like the fishery whose boat I was on –
  drag their nets along the bottom of the sea and collect everything that lives
  on or just above the seabed. This includes the fish they are targeting, but it
  also includes skates and rays that sit on the seabed and lots of other
  non-target fish – including the many shark species that live very close to the
  sea floor. It is a highly unselective and destructive type of fishing. Some
  sharks we measured and documented were the size of my hand, while others were
  more than three metres (10ft) in length. A lot of them had bioluminescence
  spots and patches on their bodies, which would be visible to other animals,
  even in this pitch-black environment they live in. It is thought this might
  give deep-sea sharks some sort of camouflage by breaking up their silhouette.
  But we do not know for sure, because most of these animals have never been
  seen alive in their natural habitat. I felt intrigued by how strange they
  looked and privileged to collect such hopefully useful data, because I suspect
  these ecosystems are incredibly important to the health and balance of the
  ocean. But I also felt really depressed because so many of these amazing
  animals were dead. I am hoping that my data, when it is published next year,
  will help to raise awareness and point to ways in which deep-sea fishing
  trawlers could be more sustainable and less damaging of these habitats. My
  research has also brought home to me the realisation that deep-sea mining
  could have a massive impact on the biodiversity of the planet. My fear is that
  we’re going to be too late for a lot of deep-sea sharks. They breed slowly, so
  if their populations are depleted, they don’t recover quickly. We know so
  little about how their ecosystems work. If they are overfished or destroyed by
  deep-sea mining, we may just wipe out entire populations or create a huge
  imbalance in deep-sea ecosystems – without even knowing we are doing it. Ruth
  Leeney is a teaching fellow at Univeristy College Dublin’s school of biology
  and environmental science. As told to Donna Ferguson This article was amended
  on 1 September 2025 to correct a caption that identified a longsnouted dogfish
  as a brier shark.
