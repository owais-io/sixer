  A private US prison contractor that is expanding its immigrant detention
  business amid increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) arrests is
  running a federal facility that is being investigated by the FBI for rampant
  drug trafficking and violence, a Guardian investigation has found. Even some
  staff who work for the contractor, CoreCivic, are implicated in drug smuggling
  at the Cibola county correctional center (CCCC) in New Mexico that is owned
  and operated by the company on a government contract. Cibola has faced various
  problems, including allegations by the FBI of extensive drug smuggling,
  including involvement by some guards, and an alarming number of deaths at the
  facility, the Guardian can reveal. The facility, about an hour west from
  Albuquerque, primarily houses people apprehended by the federal US Marshals
  Service (USMS) and local county detainees, with immigrants in Ice custody
  making up about 30% of the population. An FBI agent wrote in October 2024, in
  an affidavit submitted to a New Mexico federal court as part of a pursuit of
  suspects engaged in drug smuggling into Cibola, that there was a “drug
  trafficking epidemic” at the facility. The affidavit, obtained by the
  Guardian, accuses some CoreCivic employees at the facility of smuggling in
  drugs and fueling the lucrative trade among the detained population that has
  led to overdose deaths. A number of FBI informants “reported that there were
  dirty COs [correctional officers] at CCCC, who would smuggle drugs and other
  contraband in for inmates”, reads the FBI affidavit seen by the Guardian,
  adding: “One CO concealed suboxone and methamphetamine in his boots to get
  past security and later drops the drugs in a cell while conducting a search of
  a cell.” The investigation is based on hundreds of pages of court documents,
  FBI records, police reports, 911 call logs, reports from medical investigators
  working with the coroner’s office and numerous lawsuits exclusively accessed
  by the Guardian. The FBI began investigating the Cibola facility last
  September and the network of gangs and dealers allegedly bringing in drugs.
  That same month, according to records obtained by the American Civil Liberties
  Union (ACLU) following a freedom of information request, CoreCivic pitched
  Cibola to Ice as an ideal location for expanding immigrant detention.
  “CoreCivic proposes to work with ICE on a mutually agreeable percentage of the
  1,129-bed facility that would meet ICE’s need,” the CoreCivic document reads.
  “We are confident that the Cibola facility would prove to be a valuable
  resource to the El Paso AOR [area of responsibility].” Despite CoreCivic’s
  confidence about its Cibola operations, an FBI document shows otherwise.
  “CoreCivic struggles to keep CCCC operating in a safe and efficient manner,
  confronting many of the same issues that face other correctional facilities
  nationwide,” the FBI affidavit reads. “The quantities of drugs seized are
  exceptionally large, given that they are located within a secure federal
  facility.” It is unclear whether CoreCivic disclosed the drug problems and the
  FBI’s scrutiny in its pitch to Ice, since much of the document is redacted.
  But according to FBI records, CoreCivic probably knew about the federal
  criminal investigation – and members of what the company calls its
  intelligence unit have actively collaborated with the bureau. “We continue to
  hear claims and allegations about our Cibola County Correctional Center (CCCC)
  that are false and misleading. The reality is that we provide a safe, humane
  and appropriate environment for those entrusted to us by our government
  partners at this facility, and we are constantly striving to deliver an even
  better standard of care,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. “We
  have a zero-tolerance policy for the introduction of contraband into our
  facilities. The introduction of contraband in correctional settings is a
  nationwide challenge that requires close and constant collaboration to
  prevent.” The company also confirmed it provided intelligence to the FBI
  investigation, and added it was “grateful for the investigative efforts” of
  the agencies involved in the case. “We share their commitment to keeping
  everyone safe,” it said. At least 15 Cibola detainees have died there
  prematurely since 2018, the Guardian discovered, a relatively high number,
  documents show. “Certainly one would imagine that information regarding these
  types of investigations and this number of deaths in custody would be relevant
  to Ice’s consideration of whether or not this is a suitable facility for
  expansion of its contract [with CoreCivic],” said Eunice Cho, senior staff
  attorney with the ACLU’s National Prison Project. Asked for comment, CoreCivic
  said in a statement that it took “very seriously” anyone dying while in its
  care and was “deeply saddened” by any such death. “At all our facilities,
  including the Cibola County Correctional Center (CCCC), the safety, health and
  well-being of the individuals entrusted to our care and our dedicated staff is
  our top priority,” the company said. Tennessee-based CoreCivic is the second
  largest private corrections company in the US; it is publicly traded and
  operates scores of facilities in almost 20 states. As the Trump administration
  continues its mass deportation agenda, by arresting, detaining and deporting
  thousands of immigrants plucked from the US interior – in a switch of focus
  from the US-Mexico border – many facilities nationwide, and especially in
  hotspots, are overcrowded. Troubled facilities such as Cibola continue to be
  used to detain increasing numbers of immigrants – and the company is cashing
  in. In 2025 so far, the Guardian calculated that, according to company press
  statements and financial reports, CoreCivic has significantly increased its
  immigration detention portfolio. Seven facilities owned by the company have
  signed on to contracts to hold more Ice detainees and the company bought an
  additional Ice facility from another private prison contractor. In response to
  a lengthy request for comment, CoreCivic did not respond to the numbers
  tallied by the Guardian. Exact numbers are redacted, but according to a
  contract document from May 2025, Ice increased its payment, per bed, to
  CoreCivic for detention services at Cibola. The FBI declined to comment for
  this story or to confirm if its investigation is still under way, but the New
  Mexico US attorney’s office in effect confirmed that Cibola is still being
  investigated. “We cannot comment on the status of ongoing investigations or
  provide details beyond what has already been made public,” the US attorney’s
  office told the Guardian. The USMS did not respond to a detailed request for
  comment. Meanwhile, the drug problems persist there, according to interviews.
  Although the FBI investigation has primarily focused on smuggling into the
  USMS and the local county units within Cibola, further reporting reveals that
  drug smuggling and consumption are occurring in the Ice units, too. Two
  immigrant men at Cibola under Ice custody revealed that they have observed
  drugs being introduced into the facility and sold and consumed in their unit,
  as recently as May. In one instance, one of the men, who spoke to the
  Guardian, said he and his friend were threatened by a dealer in the unit in
  May after mistakenly being given an envelope disguised as mail from an
  attorney. The envelope contained “strips of paper” that the pair recognized as
  the kind of contraband widely purchased by detainees, for a steep price. The
  items were probably strips containing Suboxone, or the buprenorphine or
  naloxone generic versions of a prescription medication used to treat opioid
  addiction and which provides a slight high. When the detainee who allegedly
  operated as a drug dealer discovered that the envelope was erroneously given
  to one of the men, he threatened them. “He told us, ‘This paper is mine,’” the
  man recounted in a call from inside the detention center. “He then said, ‘I’ll
  give each of you $500. Accept it, or I’ll kill you.’ And we stood there with
  our mouths open,” he said. To avoid being hurt, and to avoid any trouble that
  could jeopardize their immigration cases, the two say they tried to report the
  interaction to CoreCivic guards but the guards ignored their pleas. As word
  got out, other detainees jeered at them: the two were now targets, having to
  watch their backs. Days later, for attempting to report the threat, the dealer
  assaulted them, hitting both of them and smearing feces on one of them, the
  man said. The Guardian is withholding his and his friend’s identities at their
  request, as they fear retaliation. “ Last year it was our pretty clear
  understanding that the drug issue was limited to the US Marshals’ side,” said
  Sophia Genovese, a faculty member at Georgetown University Law Center and a
  former attorney at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center (NMILC), which
  advocates for Ice detainees. “And the only time men in Ice custody, as far as
  we know, saw any drugs was when it was accidentally sent to their unit through
  the kitchen. “It was a bit surprising to hear that someone in the Ice unit was
  the intended recipient of drugs,” she added, as the problems had previously
  appeared to be limited to the other units. CoreCivic said in response that:
  “We have a robust grievance process available to all detainees that provides
  multiple safe and discrete avenues for concerns to be raised.” The Department
  of Homeland Security, which oversees Ice, vehemently denied any drug smuggling
  taking place inside the Ice units at Cibola. “Allegations that drug smuggling
  is taking place in the ICE Section of the Cibola County Corrections Center are
  FALSE. In fact, there has not been a single report of drugs within the ICE
  section of the facility,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assistant
  secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to the Guardian. She
  continued: “Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention
  centers are false. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of
  individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. ICE continues to move
  forward with the contract in its efforts to fulfill the President’s mandate to
  arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens.” Amid the scandal, a tragedy has
  been unfolding at Cibola. At least 15 people detained there have died since
  May 2018, the Guardian’s research has revealed. “ That is a significant number
  of people to have died in one facility during that period of time,” Cho said.
  “It indicates that the operation of the facility itself has serious problems.
  It seems there are significant operational problems that are leading to,
  especially in the case of suicide, likely preventable deaths.” CoreCivic
  further responded: “Our facilities have trained emergency response teams who
  work to ensure that any individual in distress receives appropriate medical
  care.” Cibola has operated since the 1990s and was acquired by CoreCivic in
  1998. In 2016, the facility was shuttered when CoreCivic lost its contract
  with the federal Bureau of Prisons. The rare step followed reports of medical
  neglect and questionable deaths, published by the Nation. However, later that
  year the facility reopened with a USMS and Ice contract with CoreCivic,
  housing pre-trial federal detainees and local county detainees but also
  immigrants and asylum seekers. Since the second Trump administration began,
  the number of immigrants detained in Cibola has risen to 224 in late June from
  160 in January. Austin Kocher, an assistant research professor at Syracuse
  University who tracks Ice enforcement, estimated an average of 405 Ice
  detainees in late April, with recent numbers sitting at just more than 200.
  The facility has the capacity to hold a total of about 1,200 detainees. “Our
  biggest concern has always been lack of medical care,” Genovese said.
  According to CoreCivic, the facility is “subject to multiple layers of
  oversight” and is also “monitored very closely by our government partners to
  ensure full compliance with policies and procedures”. Due to CoreCivic’s
  contract with Ice, DHS oversight offices conduct inspections of the facility
  and publish reports on the conditions. But Genovese said the watchdog
  inspections were limited and she had little faith in their effectiveness. The
  FBI began investigating CoreCivic’s operation of Cibola after problems of drug
  smuggling, violence and corruption escalated until federal judges began
  expressing concerns to the New Mexico US attorney’s office and matters reached
  the bureau, according to FBI records reviewed by the Guardian. More than 40
  FBI informants, including gang members, drug dealers and Mexican organized
  crime operatives in New Mexico, revealed that a network of gangs – both inside
  and outside Cibola – worked together to bring drugs into the facility, most
  commonly fentanyl, methamphetamine, Suboxone and heroin, the FBI records show.
  From January to October 2024 there were 43 drug seizures inside the facility,
  although that was fewer than past years, according to an FBI affidavit
  submitted on 29 October 2024 in the process of the agency’s investigation into
  contraband. The gangs involved in the smuggling operations include the New
  Mexico Syndicate, the state’s largest prison gang, Mexican American crime
  outfits known as the Sureños network and the Paisas gang, and the neo-Nazi
  Aryan Brotherhood. An FBI agent explained that despite being rivals on the
  street, the gangs work together to distribute drugs inside jails. “I have
  observed traditional gang rivalries set aside and associations be formed to
  distribute fentanyl and methamphetamine and make money,” Jordan Spaeth, an FBI
  special agent working in the bureau’s violent gang taskforce in Albuquerque,
  wrote in the affidavit. “Gang allegiance is secondary to money and profit.” It
  is not easy to obtain illicit drugs inside a federal facility, leading to an
  extremely lucrative drug trade. As Spaeth, the FBI agent, noted in the
  document, a pound of meth on the street can cost $1,000. Inside Cibola, the
  equivalent would cost $272,400. One fentanyl pill goes for $50, while a single
  Suboxone strip is priced at $100. People often pay for the drugs through
  intermediaries, including spouses, families and associates on the outside. The
  most common payment method is through CashApp transactions on contraband
  cellphones, which are also smuggled into Cibola. One immigrant man detained in
  one of the Ice units, who cannot be named for his own safety, confirmed to the
  Guardian the use of apps to transfer money. The FBI documented that one inmate
  made $10,000 inside Cibola in less than one month just by selling meth. The
  drugs are sneaked into Cibola in various ways. As the FBI affidavit explained,
  and as one of the immigrant men verified, people receive phoney “legal mail”,
  which facility staff don’t first open and that actually contains drugs. There
  is also the “throw-over” method, in which outside associates drive up and
  launch packages into the recreation yard to be recovered by inmates. FBI
  informants alleged, however, according to the FBI affidavit, that CoreCivic
  staff members working at Cibola have also been responsible for smuggling drugs
  into the facility. One informant told the FBI that a CoreCivic correctional
  officer, who was later fired, had probably smuggled 700 fentanyl pills into
  the Cibola. One guard, the FBI documented in its affidavit, was paid $5,000
  for each time she brought drugs into the facility. Another CoreCivic employee,
  a key manager whose name the Guardian is withholding as it was unable to reach
  the individual for comment, assigned a team of inmates to distribute food and
  items throughout the facility and those inmates would use the opportunity to
  distribute illicit drugs, the FBI document says. Furthermore, in May 2024, a
  different, unnamed correctional officer caught some detainees smoking
  methamphetamine. The guard confiscated the drugs and submitted a report,
  despite hesitance by the aforementioned manager, the FBI document says, adding
  that the guard later found the drugs had disappeared from evidence, photos had
  been deleted and their report was missing. The guard believed the manager was
  responsible for the attempted cover-up, according to the FBI affidavit. Weeks
  later, the FBI says that same manager assigned the guard to a high-security
  section of Cibola, despite the guard not having the experience or rank to be
  there. During the shift, two gang members escaped from their cell and
  assaulted the guard, knocking them out and locking them in a cell. The guard,
  beaten and bruised, was later rescued and reported that they suspected the
  manager was involved in facilitating the assault. The manager was later fired
  by CoreCivic for disciplinary problems, the FBI affidavit says, but does not
  appear to have been charged with any crimes in the case. But in 2023, another
  guard was sentenced to 24 months in prison for smuggling meth into the
  facility. The FBI affidavit says that starting pay for a CoreCivic guard is
  less than $48,000 a year, yet dealers pay guards $3,000 to $6,000 per package
  of narcotics brought into the facility. “A CO [correctional officer] who
  imports three packages a week, every week, could make twice as much in a month
  as they make a year,” the FBI affidavit states. In one instance documented in
  a New Mexico wrongful death lawsuit filed against CoreCivic by the family of a
  young woman who died of an overdose inside Cibola, a correctional officer
  confessed to smuggling drugs, explaining she needed the extra money because
  she was on the brink of losing her home. An aghast immigrant in an Ice unit at
  Cibola said in an interview: “I thought the US was a country of laws, like
  they say on the television – that they took security and safety seriously. But
  I have now learned that there is a lot of corruption here.” Ice detention
  centers throughout the country are overwhelmed. The DHS is waiting on a
  cascade of funds from the vast spending bill Donald Trump signed into law on 4
  July to further increase detention space throughout the country, even as some
  controversial new facilities are being rushed into operation. According to the
  CoreCivic pitch document obtained by the ACLU, the company says Cibola is an
  appropriate place to further incarcerate immigrants, proposing that the
  facility be entirely made up of Ice detainees, or a “mutually agreeable
  percentage”. “Regardless of the population, CoreCivic is dedicated to
  delivering excellent service to meet the partner’s needs,” the company wrote.

Weeks later, the FBI says that same manager assigned the guard to a high-security section of Cibola, despite the guard not having the experience or rank to be there. During the shift, two gang members escaped from their cell and assaulted the guard, knocking them out and locking them in a cell. The guard, beaten and bruised, was later rescued and reported that they suspected the manager was involved in facilitating the assault. The manager was later fired by CoreCivic for disciplinary problems, the FBI affidavit says, but does not appear to have been charged with any crimes in the case. But in 2023, another guard was sentenced to 24 months in prison for smuggling meth into the facility. The FBI affidavit says that starting pay for a CoreCivic guard is less than $48,000 a year, yet dealers pay guards $3,000 to $6,000 per package of narcotics brought into the facility. “A CO [correctional officer] who imports three packages a week, every week, could make twice as much in a month as they make a year,” the FBI affidavit states. In one instance documented in a New Mexico wrongful death lawsuit filed against CoreCivic by the family of a young woman who died of an overdose inside Cibola, a correctional officer confessed to smuggling drugs, explaining she needed the extra money because she was on the brink of losing her home. An aghast immigrant in an Ice unit at Cibola said in an interview: “I thought the US was a country of laws, like they say on the television – that they took security and safety seriously. But I have now learned that there is a lot of corruption here.” Ice detention centers throughout the country are overwhelmed. The DHS is waiting on a cascade of funds from the vast spending bill Donald Trump signed into law on 4 July to further increase detention space throughout the country, even as some controversial new facilities are being rushed into operation. According to the CoreCivic pitch document obtained by the ACLU, the company says Cibola is an appropriate place to further incarcerate immigrants, proposing that the facility be entirely made up of Ice detainees, or a “mutually agreeable percentage”. “Regardless of the population, CoreCivic is dedicated to delivering excellent service to meet the partner’s needs,” the company wrote.
