  Australia’s modern slavery laws are among the weakest in the developed world
  and the country risks becoming a “dumping ground” for goods made with forced
  labour, Australia’s first anti-slavery commissioner has said. In a
  wide-ranging interview with Guardian Australia, the commissioner, Chris Evans
  – a former Labor senator and minister – said there were “blind spots” in
  Australia’s efforts that risked the country becoming a global laggard. “Not
  only are we not keeping up to the standard of acceptable corporate
  responsibility,” he said of Australia’s Modern Slavery Act, “but we’re also
  now running the risk of being a dumping ground because of the fact that we
  have the lowest level of prevention of goods made with forced labour coming
  into our country.” His comments come as a report by the UN special rapporteur
  on contemporary forms of slavery argued that migrants and vulnerable
  minorities “slip through the cracks” to be exploited in Australia. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The attorney general, Michelle Rowland, described modern
  slavery as “abhorrent” and said the government was committed to combating it.
  Evans said jurisdictions comparable to Australia, including the US, Canada, or
  – soon – the EU had introduced import bans on goods made with, or strongly
  suspected of being made with, forced labour. No such ban exists in Australia.
  Australia has one of the “weakest regimes in dealing with forced labour”,
  Evans said, arguing that companies making goods with forced labour on warning
  lists, and excluded from markets such as US, Canada or Europe, would seek to
  export to countries without import bans. “We’re [Australia] at risk of
  becoming a dumping ground for goods that are designed for … wealthy western
  countries, but which may have serious issues with forced labour in their
  supply chains.” Australia’s other most pressing “blind spot” was in low rates
  of identification and prosecution of offences occurring inside Australia, he
  said. “Some people like to comfort themselves by thinking, well, that means we
  don’t have much of a problem here, but … that’s nonsense: what it means is we
  haven’t been very good at … identifying those people who are being exploited
  and secondly … there are real issues about prosecutions in Australia and the
  amount of time it takes to get a case to court.” Walk Free’s Global Slavery
  Index estimates that there are about 41,000 people held in modern slavery in
  Australia. The Guardian requested statistics from the commonwealth director of
  public prosecutions on modern slavery prosecutions. Data provided to the UN
  office of drugs and crime shows that in 2023 – the latest figures available –
  352 people were “brought into formal contact with the police and/or criminal
  justice system because they have been suspected of, arrested for, or cautioned
  for trafficking in persons”. Five people were prosecuted. Zero were convicted.
  Evans said Australia’s Modern Slavery Act, introduced in 2018, was
  “light-touch” legislation and Australia had failed to progress from that
  “first tentative step”. The act mandates only that companies turning over more
  than $100m a year issue modern slavery reports: it imposes no obligations to
  address risks. There are no penalties for failing to report and no penalties
  for substandard reporting. It’s estimated that between 400 and 1,000 companies
  who are obliged to report on modern slavery in their practices or supply
  chains are refusing to do so. Some companies are reporting comprehensively,
  Evans said: “Others quite frankly are taking the mickey, by putting in two
  pages of ‘we oppose modern slavery’ and that’s been regarded as sufficient to
  pass muster.” He argued that Australia’s modern slavery laws needed to move
  from a reporting mandate to a “due diligence” model, where companies were
  required to act to prevent modern slavery in their supply chains or business
  practices. Evans said the introduction of penalties was similarly overdue. In
  2023 the former ombudsman Prof John McMillan led a review of Australia’s
  Modern Slavery Act. He found “no hard evidence that the Modern Slavery Act …
  has yet caused meaningful change for people living in conditions of modern
  slavery”. Among his 30 recommendations was that the act be updated to include:
  an obligation that companies must address modern slavery risks in their supply
  chains; penalties for companies that fail to comply; and high-risk
  declarations for regions, factories or suppliers. The government did not
  respond until December 2024 – accepting in full, part or principle 25 of the
  30 recommendations – but many have not been implemented. The government
  released a consultation paper in July. Rowland said Australia had “strong laws
  and a comprehensive response to combat modern slavery practices, such as human
  trafficking, slavery, and slavery-like practices”. “The Albanese government is
  committed to continuing our efforts to strengthen our response,” she said.
  This month the UN special rapporteur Prof Tomoya Obokata said he was
  “seriously concerned by the treatments of temporary migrant workers in
  Australia”, reporting “disturbing, sometimes very serious, patterns of
  exploitative practices by employers, labour hire companies and migration
  agents”. Obokata highlighted the exploitation of asylum seekers and refugees;
  people with disabilities; temporary migrant workers such as those on the
  Pacific Australia labour mobility scheme (particularly those who had
  “disengaged” from it and were outside its protections); domestic workers in
  diplomatic households; and students visa-holders. He said vulnerable and
  marginalised people were let down by Australia’s “patchwork” laws. The
  government will respond to Obokata’s report at the human rights council in
  September.
