  Jamie Jackson’s match report is here [Was the performance a step forward?]
  It’s the first game of the season so we can’t speak about a step forward. We
  did a lot of good things but obviously it wasn’t enough. We created too many
  chances without scoring; that’s the main negative today. [On Arsenal’s goal]
  Corners are part of the game. We know they are very good at set-pieces. I
  haven’t seen the goal again but when you touch the goalkeeper when he wants to
  jump it makes it very difficult for him and unfortunately Altay couldn’t get
  the ball out of the goal. I was at the first post and I haven’t seen a replay
  so I can’t talk about [whether it was a foul]. But Altay said there was a
  touch as he went to punch the ball. We know in the Premier League they don’t
  give much in this type of situation. [On Cunha and Mbeumo] They created a lot
  and they were in the right positions. They were dangerous and it was a good
  first impression for them. But I’m sure they will do much better. “Charles
  Antaki (4.21pm) didn’t get his wish for goals, plural,” says Kári Tulinius,
  “but I’m sure he doesn’t mind.” Arsenal don’t win often at Old Trafford, but
  when they do it’s usually like this. Their last seven victories on this ground
  have been 1-0: 1985-86, 1990-91, 1997-98, 2001-02, 2006-07, 2023-24 and now
  2025-26. New signings or not, it was a victory for established strengths:
  set-pieces and the best defence in England. Man Utd were lively, especially
  Matheus Cunha, and deserved a draw on the balance of play, but Arsenal slowly
  drained the optimism out of them. It was ultimately settled by a simple header
  from Riccardo Calafiori, who took advantage when Altay Bayindir made a mess of
  Declan Rice’s corner. All over at Old Trafford. 90+6 min Saka’s superb cross
  looks set to give Madueke a tap-in, only for Bruno Fernandes to divert the
  ball with a crucial flying kick. It hits Madueke and bounces clear. 90+5 min
  Fernandes’s corner is headed up in the air by Saliba. De Ligt then heads it
  down into the crowd and Raya claims. 90+5 min One last corner for Man Utd.
  Peter Schmeichel is forward… 90+4 min Havertz draws a foul from Ugarte to eat
  up another 30 seconds. He’s been excellent since coming off the bench. 90+2
  min Arsenal take the corner and go back to the halfway line. Lewis-Skelly lets
  the ball run under his foot and then fouls Mbeumo; he’s booked. 90+2 min:
  Chance for Saka Odegaard finds Saka with a cute short pass into the area. Saka
  watches the bounce and batters a shot that deflects behind off the lunging De
  Ligt. 90+1 min Timber is booked for timewasting. 90 min Six minutes of added
  time. 89 min Desperate defending from Arsenal. Saliba makes a vital challenge
  on Cunha on the six-yard line, then De Ligt – getting well forward as the
  right-sided centre-back – has a snapshot blocked. Actually, having seen that
  again Saliba didn’t win the ball when he challenged Cunha. I’m not sure it was
  a foul, though, mainly because Cunha fell into Saliba rather than the other
  way round. I’d like to see it again though. 88 min Ugarte receives the ball 30
  yards out with four or five men waiting for a pass. They can wait all they
  like, because Ugarte has decided he’s Arie Haan and that’s all there is to it.
  Goalkick to Arsenal. 86 min Arsenal’s defence have managed the second half
  expertly, with United rarely threatening to get in behind as they did in the
  first half. 85 min Extended pressure from United, with the impressive Cunha
  involved in everything. He’s been the best of the debutants on either side I’d
  say. Arsenal withstand the pressure until Timber is fouled by Dorgu. He’s
  booked, as is David Raya for taking his time over the resulting free-kick. 83
  min: Arsenal substitution Mikel Merino replaces Declan Rice, who isn’t injured
  but looks pretty shattered. 82 min The resulting free-kick is 22 yards from
  goal to the right of centre. Rice’s kick deflects off Dorgu and into the side
  netting; Bayindir had it covered. 81 min A bad ball from Ugarte goes to
  Havertz, who is unapologetically taken out by Maguire. He’s very lucky to
  escape a yellow card for that. 80 min: Man Utd substitution Harry Maguire on,
  Luke Shaw off. Maguire and Sesko up front on the opening day, surely not. For
  now he’s in defence. 78 min Amad beats Madueke again, this time on the
  outside, and cuts the ball back. Zubimendi miskicks horribly but gets away
  with it. United come again through Shaw, whose cross is claimed by Raya. Amad
  went down under a challenge from Lewis-Skelly at the far post and enquired for
  a penalty. No dice. 77 min Amad beats Madueke through sleight of hip, cuts
  inside and shoots straight at Raya from 20 yards. The first part was good, the
  second not so much. 76 min Arsenal have lacked ruthlessness on the
  counter-attack in the second half. They’ve got between the lines a few times
  only to take the wrong option or play an imperfect pass. 73 min Dorgu’s
  deflected cross loops towards Mbeumo, who hangs in the air and powers a
  downward header towards goal from 12 yards. It bounces up nicely for Raya, who
  throws himself to the left to push it away with both hands. Moments later,
  Sesko heads a cross well wide. That was a very tough chance, Mbeumo’s a bit
  better though he had to generate all the pace on the header. He did that well
  but couldn’t guide it into the corner. 71 min: Double substitution for Arsenal
  Mikel Arteta is changing his full-backs: Jurrien Timber and Myles Lewis-Skelly
  replace Ben White and the goalscorer Riccardo Calafiori. 70 min Ben White is
  down and needs treatment. Well, he’s getting treatment: Cunha thinks he’s
  trying it on and is having words with Odegaard among others. 69 min Bayindir
  drills the ball into Cunha, who loses White with an outrageous volleyed
  backflick, runs 40 yards and slides the ball into Mbeumo in the area. He can’t
  get his shot away and eventually there’s a scramble involving Amad, Gabriel
  and Calafiori. Arsenal clear, the ball is swing back into the box and Mbeumo’s
  hopeful overhead kick flies wide. 68 min Cunha, on the left now, flicks a nice
  pass into Dorgu in the area. He has the ball for about 0.2 seconds before
  Saliba smoothly picks his pocket. He does that so well. 65 min: Double
  substitution for Man Utd Benjamin Sesko and Manuel Ugarte replace Mason Mount
  and Casemiro, who both had pretty good games. 7/10 maybe. 64 min Rice, teed up
  by Madueke, has a shot from the edge of the area that is kicked away by Yoro.
  62 min Arsenal protect a lead better than any team in England, and United –
  despite some promising attacks and around 70 per cent possession – are yet to
  have a shot on target in the second half. It looks like Ruben Amorim will
  attempt to change that by bringing on Big Ben. 60 min: Double substitution for
  Arsenal Kai Havertz and Noni Madueke replace Viktor Gyokeres, who worked hard
  for little reward, and Gabriel Martinelli. 59 min There’s a frantic pace to
  the game now. I’m not sure which team that suits. Arsenal are about to bring
  on Noni Madueke, a forward who plays at his own pace. Rice shoots over from
  distance. 57 min Fernandes, on the left wing, hammers a dangerous free-kick
  under the crossbar. David Raya, under as much pressure as Bayindir was for the
  goal, punches decisively clear. Excellent goalkeeping. 55 min Mbeumo threatens
  to run through on goal after a straight pass down the middle from Fernandes.
  Gabriel steps across to get between Mbeumo and the ball, with Arsenal
  eventually clearing a little awkwardly. 55 min: Man Utd substitution An
  attacking change at right wing-back: Amad Diallo replaces Diogo Dalot. 51 min
  Lots of United possession at the start of the second half. But then Casemiro
  gives the ball away and Odegaard releases Gyokeres in space on the left. He
  moves towards the area, then leaves the ball behind and fouls Casemiro in an
  attempt to win it back. 50 min Arsenal appeal unsuccessfully for a foul throw
  against Dorgu. WHAT THE HELL IS VAR FOR IF NOT THAT? 49 min Shaw combines with
  Dorgu, keeps running and cuts a cross back towards Mount. His left-foot
  snapshot is blocked by the well-positioned Saliba. 46 min Peep peep! The
  second half is under way. “I went to Law 12, subsection 2 (what do you expect,
  I’m a lawyer) and it deals with indirect free kicks,” says Adam Roberts. “ The
  closest I could find was (a player who) ‘impedes the progress of an opponent
  without any contact being made’ should have an indirect free kick awarded
  against him. Have I missed something or has American Football offensive
  blocking been legalised in real football?” I’m not sure about that. I mean,
  I’m sure Saliba knew what he was doing but there’s a legitimate argument that
  it falls under jockeying rather than obstruction. Far more importantly, so did
  all the match officials. Arsenal lead through the shortest of short-range
  headers Riccardo Calafiori. It came from their first corner of the season,
  whacked under the crossbar by Declan Rice and mishandled by Altay Bayindir.
  Overall United were slightly the better team: Patrick Dorgu hit a post and the
  vivacious Matheus Cunha drew a quietly brilliant save from David Raya. 45 min
  De Ligt goes flying after bouncing off Gyokeres, who turns back infield from
  the right but then overhits his pass to Saka. Gyokeres has done well enough
  with no real service; much of his involvement has been channel runs and
  physical battles with Matthijs de Ligt. 43 min Mount has a shot on the turn
  blocked after combining with Cunha. Ruben Amorim will be pleased with United’s
  first-half performance, if not the scoreline. The front three of Cunha, Mount
  and Mbeumo have all been good. 42 min The lively Mbeumo rolls Calafiori, who
  pulls him back with no attempt at disguise and is booked. 41 min Saka’s corner
  is half cleared to Odegaard, whose mishit volley from 15 yards is blocked.
  Half a chance, that, for a player of his class. Well, probably more like 0.1
  xG than 0.5, but you know what I mean. 38 min Mount plays a short pass to
  Cunha on the left side of a crowded area. He veers suddenly between Rice and
  Saliba and forces a low shot from a tight angle that is brilliantly saved by
  Raya. He plunged to his left with almost no reaction time and got a slight but
  crucial touch to brush the ball past the far post. 36 min “Who does Martinelli
  think he is with that abysmal bicycle attempt, a Brazilian like Richarlison?”
  sniffs Joe Pearson. “What? Oh.” 35 min Odegaard, who has been terrific since
  Arsenal’s goal, slips Fernandes and Casemiro before hammering a shot from 20
  yards. It’s too straight and saved by Bayindir. Actually Bayindir did well
  because the ball bounced just in front so could easily have slithered out of
  his grasp. 34 min Cunha works Raya again with a curving shot from distance.
  Comfortable save. He and Mbeumo have been lively. 33 min: Raya saves from
  Cunha Arsenal counter until Martinelli fresh-airs an acrobatic volley. United
  counter the counter via Cunha, who bulldozes straight through two or three
  defenders just inside the Arsenal half. By the time he reaches the edge of the
  area he’s shattered; the best he can do is a shot under pressure from Saliba
  that Raya saves comfortably. 30 min Fernandes pushes a ball out to Dorgu in
  space on the left. He runs to within 20 yards of goal, with Saliba waiting to
  engage, and blasts a fine shot across goal. It beats the diving Raya and hits
  the outside of the post. 29 min Mount finds Dorgu in space with an excellent
  blind pass. Nothing comes of it but that’s three or four times Mount has
  opened the game up with his vision and passing. 28 min Dalot’s cross is
  shanked Hackney Marshily across his own area by Saliba, though it matters not
  because Dalot was offside and the ball was cleared anyway. 27 min “Hmm,” says
  Andy Donald. “’Bayindir was blocked but not fouled by Saliba’ is a bit of an
  interesting statement. Can you block a goalkeeper whilst not fouling him?” You
  betcha. Law 12, subsection 2, and yes of course I had to check which law it
  was. 26 min A nothing shot from Martinelli is easily saved by Bayindir. 25 min
  Casemiro wins the ball cleanly off Odegaard and sweeps an early long pass to
  Mbeumo. He cuts inside, uses Cunha by not using him, then gives Raya the eyes
  and drives a shot towards the near post from about 20 yards. It hits Gabriel
  and goes behind for a corner. 22 min Raya faffs around on the ball and is
  challenged by Cunha, who then goes over after an awkward lunge from Raya.
  Cunha wants a penalty; he won’t get one but that was very risky from Raya. 21
  min Arsenal have been the better team since the goal. Martinelli stabs a pass
  that puts Calafiori through on goal… only for the flag to go up. 20 min Here,
  have some match reports from the 2pm games. Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace
  Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford 19 min Rice overhits this free-kick and
  Bayindir claims comfortably. 18 min Now Shaw is given a last warning after a
  late tackle on Odegaard. The goal has enlivened Arsenal and Odegaard is
  starting to get on the ball in open play. 17 min Fernandes, who scored a
  lovely free-kick against Arsenal on this ground last season, smacks this one
  into the wall. Specifically the face of Declan Rice. 16 min Fernandes is
  fouled just outside the area by Zubimendi, a clumsy and needless challenge as
  Fernandes controlld a long ball on the chest. One corner, one goal. Rice
  curled a wicked inswinger under the crossbar, Bayindir made a mess of it and
  Calafiori headed over the line from 0.00001 yards. The ball was going in
  anyway for what would have been an own goal. Bayindir, who was blocked but not
  fouled by Saliba, got a touch on Rice’s corner but could only help it limply
  towards the far corner of the net. Sorry to say that’s a bit of a howler from
  him. But it was a fantastic ball in from Rice. Cut to the set-piece coach:
  Arsenal have done it again! 12 min Odegaard wins Arsenal’s first corner after
  a very dodgy pass from Fernandes in his own area is intercepted by Calafiori.
  10 min Fernandes’ corner is claimed with authority by David Raya, who gets
  Arsenal going on the break with a quick roll-out. Odegaard finds Saka, who is
  crucially tackled just outside the Manchester United area by Mount. He had to
  win that. 10 min White heads behind to give United their first corner. Arsenal
  haven’t got going at all – in fact, as I type they’ve had 23 per cent
  possession. 9 min Saliba gets a warning from Simon Hooper after a late tackle
  on Dorgu. One more and you’re in the book, etc. 8 min United are having more
  of the ball early on. Fernandes takes a short free-kick to Dorgu, who shoots
  miles wide from distance. 6 min Mount guides a fabulous curving pass into the
  path of Mbeumo, galloping into space behind the Arsenal defence. Gabriel (I
  think) does well to force him wide and Mbeumo’s right-foot shot is comfortably
  saved by David Raya. 5 min Fernandes’s free-kick is a peculiar mess that
  doesn’t even reach the penalty area before Odegaard volleys clear. 4 min An
  extended spell of possession for Man Utd ends when White goes through the back
  of Dorgu. Free-kick on the left wing, 35 yards from goal. 2 min Man Utd have
  started with Bruno Fernandes in midfield, Mount as the left-sided No10 and
  Matheus Cunha up front. 2 min “A happy season’s beginning to you!” says
  Russell Yong. “In the spirit of a new season, the heart feels like it is
  washed of angst, the soul feels clean, unburdened by the endless troll wars
  and gentlemanly disagreements to come. In that spirit comes magnanimity; the
  feeling that it’s just a simple game, that no one’s character is judgable by
  who they support, that no team, manager or player is ever as bad or great as
  the baying masses say they are, that come what may, moderate heads and
  moderate views will prevail. At least until United find themselves 5-0 down
  after 20 minutes, I guess, in which case, let opinions and arses run amok once
  more!” 1 min Mbeumo leads a dangerous break inside the first minute, only to
  overhit his pass to Cunha. He controlled a dropping ball superbly, though he
  caught Martin Zubimendi with his arm in the process. Play was allowed to
  continue with United unable to capitalise. 1 min So the story begins. The
  players line up for the pre-match business on a beautiful summer afternoon in
  Manchester. A quick note while I remember: our man Jamie Jackson will be on
  TalkSPORT at half-time to discuss this game. A reminder of the teams Man Utd
  (3-4-2-1) Bayindir; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu;
  Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha. Subs: Heaton, Fredericson, Heaven, Maguire, Mainoo,
  Ugarte, Amad, Zirkzee, Sesko. Arsenal (4-3-3) Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel,
  Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Rice; Saka, Gyokeres, Martinelli. Subs:
  Arrizabalaga, Mosquera, Timber, Lewis-Skelly, Merino, Nwaneri, Trossard,
  Madueke, Havertz. Referee Simon Hooper “Well,” says Charles Antaki, “I’ve done
  my bit: the altar dusted down and polished, votive candles lit, Tibetan prayer
  wheel given a hearty spin and the computer screen orientated south-south-east.
  it’s all up to Mick Arteta and the boys now. Thoughts and prayers. Also,
  please, goals.” Plural. Interesting. We’re at home and we want to get three
  points. We know that everything is not going to change in four weeks but we
  have made steps that are really important for the future. [On Benjamin Sesko’s
  role as substitute] We picked the starting XI thinking also about the end of
  the game, so we need to balance that. Ben had a very good week but it’s just
  one week. We have to remember that there’s a lot of emotion – changing
  countries, culture, working with new people. The first impression is really
  important so let the guy settle down. He’s ready to help us in the game. [On
  the absence of Onana and Hojlund from the squad] It’s an option. It’s an
  option. We tried to choose the best players for each game. Next week it’s a
  different life. [Is Onana injured?] No, he recovered, but the other guys did
  so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that. I’m very excited about
  the season. We start with a great opportunity at Old Trafford. I know what
  this game will demand but I’m very excited about what’s coming. What a place
  to play the first game; we’re ready for it. [On Viktor Gyokeres] Goals are his
  main quality. He brings a fear factor as well – it’s not just his ability to
  put the ball in the back of the net but the feeling he creates in the
  opposition. Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford Andy
  Brassell profiles ‘Big’ Benjamin Sesko, who will surely be involved from the
  bench at some stage. Championship match report Two of last season’s relegated
  teams met at Portman Road this afternoon. It finds Ipswich 1-1 Southampton,
  and you can read all about it here. 8th, 8th, 5th, 2nd, 2nd, 2nd, ?? Jamie
  Jackson explores the curious case of the marginalised Mainoo Viktor Gyokeres,
  Arsenal’s new centre-forward, goes straight into the starting XI. Martin
  Zubimendi also starts in midfield, with Noni Madueke and Cristhian Mosquera on
  the bench. Riccardo Calafiori and Ben White are preferred to Myles
  Lewis-Skelly and Jurrien Timber at full-back. In recent years Arsenal have
  been criticised for their bench strength. Not today. Arsenal (4-3-3) Raya;
  White, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Rice; Saka, Gyokeres,
  Martinelli. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Mosquera, Timber, Lewis-Skelly, Merino,
  Nwaneri, Trossard, Madueke, Havertz. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha start,
  Benjamin Sesko is on the bench. Rasmus Hojlund isn’t in the squad. Mason Mount
  is also included, probably as the left-sided No10 with Bruno Fernandes playing
  deeper. That said, Sky have the United team with Mount as a false nine. With
  Andre Onana still recovering from a hamstring injury [edit: that’s not the
  case, see Ruben Amorim’s pre-match interview], Altay Bayindir is in goal. Man
  Utd (3-4-2-1) Bayindir; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes,
  Dorgu; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha. Subs: Heaton, Fredericson, Heaven, Maguire,
  Mainoo, Ugarte, Amad, Zirkzee, Sesko. Hello, hello and welcome to live
  coverage of Manchester United v Arsenal at Old Trafford. Broadly, there are
  two ways to view this game: It’s the game of the weekend, a humdinger between
  two of English football’s Holy Trinity. A perfect way to start the season!
  It’s 15th v 2nd based on last season’s league table. Why’s everyone getting so
  excited? We’re in camp 1. The thought of an unenticing match between
  Manchester United and Arsenal at any stage of the season does not compute. And
  this isn’t any stage: it’s the opening weekend, a window in time when
  everything is hope and hope is everything. Right now Benjamin Sesko, Viktor
  Gyokeres, Bryan Mbuemo, Martin Zubimendi and all the other new signings exist
  solely in the imagination of supporter, silhouettes of football perfection who
  will take United and Arsenal to the next level. The last time these two met on
  the opening weekend was 36 years ago – Michael Knighton, Neil Webb and all
  that – so this is kind of a big deal. That 1989 match, won 4-1 by a United
  side who soon fell into a relegation battle, is a reminder that we shouldn’t
  get carried away with today’s result. That’s exactly what we’ll be doing,
  isn’t it. Kick off 4.30pm.

He can’t get his shot away and eventually there’s a scramble involving Amad, Gabriel and Calafiori. Arsenal clear, the ball is swing back into the box and Mbeumo’s hopeful overhead kick flies wide. 68 min Cunha, on the left now, flicks a nice pass into Dorgu in the area. He has the ball for about 0.2 seconds before Saliba smoothly picks his pocket. He does that so well. 65 min: Double substitution for Man Utd Benjamin Sesko and Manuel Ugarte replace Mason Mount and Casemiro, who both had pretty good games. 7/10 maybe. 64 min Rice, teed up by Madueke, has a shot from the edge of the area that is kicked away by Yoro. 62 min Arsenal protect a lead better than any team in England, and United – despite some promising attacks and around 70 per cent possession – are yet to have a shot on target in the second half. It looks like Ruben Amorim will attempt to change that by bringing on Big Ben. 60 min: Double substitution for Arsenal Kai Havertz and Noni Madueke replace Viktor Gyokeres, who worked hard for little reward, and Gabriel Martinelli. 59 min There’s a frantic pace to the game now. I’m not sure which team that suits. Arsenal are about to bring on Noni Madueke, a forward who plays at his own pace. Rice shoots over from distance. 57 min Fernandes, on the left wing, hammers a dangerous free-kick under the crossbar. David Raya, under as much pressure as Bayindir was for the goal, punches decisively clear. Excellent goalkeeping. 55 min Mbeumo threatens to run through on goal after a straight pass down the middle from Fernandes. Gabriel steps across to get between Mbeumo and the ball, with Arsenal eventually clearing a little awkwardly. 55 min: Man Utd substitution An attacking change at right wing-back: Amad Diallo replaces Diogo Dalot. 51 min Lots of United possession at the start of the second half. But then Casemiro gives the ball away and Odegaard releases Gyokeres in space on the left. He moves towards the area, then leaves the ball behind and fouls Casemiro in an attempt to win it back. 50 min Arsenal appeal unsuccessfully for a foul throw against Dorgu. WHAT THE HELL IS VAR FOR IF NOT THAT? 49 min Shaw combines with Dorgu, keeps running and cuts a cross back towards Mount. His left-foot snapshot is blocked by the well-positioned Saliba. 46 min Peep peep! The second half is under way. “I went to Law 12, subsection 2 (what do you expect, I’m a lawyer) and it deals with indirect free kicks,” says Adam Roberts. “ The closest I could find was (a player who) ‘impedes the progress of an opponent without any contact being made’ should have an indirect free kick awarded against him. Have I missed something or has American Football offensive blocking been legalised in real football?” I’m not sure about that. I mean, I’m sure Saliba knew what he was doing but there’s a legitimate argument that it falls under jockeying rather than obstruction. Far more importantly, so did all the match officials. Arsenal lead through the shortest of short-range headers Riccardo Calafiori. It came from their first corner of the season, whacked under the crossbar by Declan Rice and mishandled by Altay Bayindir. Overall United were slightly the better team: Patrick Dorgu hit a post and the vivacious Matheus Cunha drew a quietly brilliant save from David Raya. 45 min De Ligt goes flying after bouncing off Gyokeres, who turns back infield from the right but then overhits his pass to Saka. Gyokeres has done well enough with no real service; much of his involvement has been channel runs and physical battles with Matthijs de Ligt. 43 min Mount has a shot on the turn blocked after combining with Cunha. Ruben Amorim will be pleased with United’s first-half performance, if not the scoreline. The front three of Cunha, Mount and Mbeumo have all been good. 42 min The lively Mbeumo rolls Calafiori, who pulls him back with no attempt at disguise and is booked. 41 min Saka’s corner is half cleared to Odegaard, whose mishit volley from 15 yards is blocked. Half a chance, that, for a player of his class. Well, probably more like 0.1 xG than 0.5, but you know what I mean. 38 min Mount plays a short pass to Cunha on the left side of a crowded area. He veers suddenly between Rice and Saliba and forces a low shot from a tight angle that is brilliantly saved by Raya. He plunged to his left with almost no reaction time and got a slight but crucial touch to brush the ball past the far post. 36 min “Who does Martinelli think he is with that abysmal bicycle attempt, a Brazilian like Richarlison?” sniffs Joe Pearson. “What? Oh.” 35 min Odegaard, who has been terrific since Arsenal’s goal, slips Fernandes and Casemiro before hammering a shot from 20 yards. It’s too straight and saved by Bayindir. Actually Bayindir did well because the ball bounced just in front so could easily have slithered out of his grasp. 34 min Cunha works Raya again with a curving shot from distance. Comfortable save. He and Mbeumo have been lively. 33 min: Raya saves from Cunha Arsenal counter until Martinelli fresh-airs an acrobatic volley. United counter the counter via Cunha, who bulldozes straight through two or three defenders just inside the Arsenal half. By the time he reaches the edge of the area he’s shattered; the best he can do is a shot under pressure from Saliba that Raya saves comfortably. 30 min Fernandes pushes a ball out to Dorgu in space on the left. He runs to within 20 yards of goal, with Saliba waiting to engage, and blasts a fine shot across goal. It beats the diving Raya and hits the outside of the post. 29 min Mount finds Dorgu in space with an excellent blind pass. Nothing comes of it but that’s three or four times Mount has opened the game up with his vision and passing. 28 min Dalot’s cross is shanked Hackney Marshily across his own area by Saliba, though it matters not because Dalot was offside and the ball was cleared anyway. 27 min “Hmm,” says Andy Donald. “’Bayindir was blocked but not fouled by Saliba’ is a bit of an interesting statement. Can you block a goalkeeper whilst not fouling him?” You betcha. Law 12, subsection 2, and yes of course I had to check which law it was. 26 min A nothing shot from Martinelli is easily saved by Bayindir. 25 min Casemiro wins the ball cleanly off Odegaard and sweeps an early long pass to Mbeumo. He cuts inside, uses Cunha by not using him, then gives Raya the eyes and drives a shot towards the near post from about 20 yards. It hits Gabriel and goes behind for a corner. 22 min Raya faffs around on the ball and is challenged by Cunha, who then goes over after an awkward lunge from Raya. Cunha wants a penalty; he won’t get one but that was very risky from Raya. 21 min Arsenal have been the better team since the goal. Martinelli stabs a pass that puts Calafiori through on goal… only for the flag to go up. 20 min Here, have some match reports from the 2pm games. Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford 19 min Rice overhits this free-kick and Bayindir claims comfortably. 18 min Now Shaw is given a last warning after a late tackle on Odegaard. The goal has enlivened Arsenal and Odegaard is starting to get on the ball in open play. 17 min Fernandes, who scored a lovely free-kick against Arsenal on this ground last season, smacks this one into the wall. Specifically the face of Declan Rice. 16 min Fernandes is fouled just outside the area by Zubimendi, a clumsy and needless challenge as Fernandes controlld a long ball on the chest. One corner, one goal. Rice curled a wicked inswinger under the crossbar, Bayindir made a mess of it and Calafiori headed over the line from 0.00001 yards. The ball was going in anyway for what would have been an own goal. Bayindir, who was blocked but not fouled by Saliba, got a touch on Rice’s corner but could only help it limply towards the far corner of the net. Sorry to say that’s a bit of a howler from him. But it was a fantastic ball in from Rice. Cut to the set-piece coach: Arsenal have done it again! 12 min Odegaard wins Arsenal’s first corner after a very dodgy pass from Fernandes in his own area is intercepted by Calafiori. 10 min Fernandes’ corner is claimed with authority by David Raya, who gets Arsenal going on the break with a quick roll-out. Odegaard finds Saka, who is crucially tackled just outside the Manchester United area by Mount. He had to win that. 10 min White heads behind to give United their first corner. Arsenal haven’t got going at all – in fact, as I type they’ve had 23 per cent possession. 9 min Saliba gets a warning from Simon Hooper after a late tackle on Dorgu. One more and you’re in the book, etc. 8 min United are having more of the ball early on. Fernandes takes a short free-kick to Dorgu, who shoots miles wide from distance. 6 min Mount guides a fabulous curving pass into the path of Mbeumo, galloping into space behind the Arsenal defence. Gabriel (I think) does well to force him wide and Mbeumo’s right-foot shot is comfortably saved by David Raya. 5 min Fernandes’s free-kick is a peculiar mess that doesn’t even reach the penalty area before Odegaard volleys clear. 4 min An extended spell of possession for Man Utd ends when White goes through the back of Dorgu. Free-kick on the left wing, 35 yards from goal. 2 min Man Utd have started with Bruno Fernandes in midfield, Mount as the left-sided No10 and Matheus Cunha up front. 2 min “A happy season’s beginning to you!” says Russell Yong. “In the spirit of a new season, the heart feels like it is washed of angst, the soul feels clean, unburdened by the endless troll wars and gentlemanly disagreements to come. In that spirit comes magnanimity; the feeling that it’s just a simple game, that no one’s character is judgable by who they support, that no team, manager or player is ever as bad or great as the baying masses say they are, that come what may, moderate heads and moderate views will prevail. At least until United find themselves 5-0 down after 20 minutes, I guess, in which case, let opinions and arses run amok once more!” 1 min Mbeumo leads a dangerous break inside the first minute, only to overhit his pass to Cunha. He controlled a dropping ball superbly, though he caught Martin Zubimendi with his arm in the process. Play was allowed to continue with United unable to capitalise. 1 min So the story begins. The players line up for the pre-match business on a beautiful summer afternoon in Manchester. A quick note while I remember: our man Jamie Jackson will be on TalkSPORT at half-time to discuss this game. A reminder of the teams Man Utd (3-4-2-1) Bayindir; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha. Subs: Heaton, Fredericson, Heaven, Maguire, Mainoo, Ugarte, Amad, Zirkzee, Sesko. Arsenal (4-3-3) Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Rice; Saka, Gyokeres, Martinelli. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Mosquera, Timber, Lewis-Skelly, Merino, Nwaneri, Trossard, Madueke, Havertz. Referee Simon Hooper “Well,” says Charles Antaki, “I’ve done my bit: the altar dusted down and polished, votive candles lit, Tibetan prayer wheel given a hearty spin and the computer screen orientated south-south-east. it’s all up to Mick Arteta and the boys now. Thoughts and prayers. Also, please, goals.” Plural. Interesting. We’re at home and we want to get three points. We know that everything is not going to change in four weeks but we have made steps that are really important for the future. [On Benjamin Sesko’s role as substitute] We picked the starting XI thinking also about the end of the game, so we need to balance that. Ben had a very good week but it’s just one week. We have to remember that there’s a lot of emotion – changing countries, culture, working with new people. The first impression is really important so let the guy settle down. He’s ready to help us in the game. [On the absence of Onana and Hojlund from the squad] It’s an option. It’s an option. We tried to choose the best players for each game. Next week it’s a different life. [Is Onana injured?] No, he recovered, but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that. I’m very excited about the season. We start with a great opportunity at Old Trafford. I know what this game will demand but I’m very excited about what’s coming. What a place to play the first game; we’re ready for it. [On Viktor Gyokeres] Goals are his main quality. He brings a fear factor as well – it’s not just his ability to put the ball in the back of the net but the feeling he creates in the opposition. Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford Andy Brassell profiles ‘Big’ Benjamin Sesko, who will surely be involved from the bench at some stage. Championship match report Two of last season’s relegated teams met at Portman Road this afternoon. It finds Ipswich 1-1 Southampton, and you can read all about it here. 8th, 8th, 5th, 2nd, 2nd, 2nd, ?? Jamie Jackson explores the curious case of the marginalised Mainoo Viktor Gyokeres, Arsenal’s new centre-forward, goes straight into the starting XI. Martin Zubimendi also starts in midfield, with Noni Madueke and Cristhian Mosquera on the bench. Riccardo Calafiori and Ben White are preferred to Myles Lewis-Skelly and Jurrien Timber at full-back. In recent years Arsenal have been criticised for their bench strength. Not today. Arsenal (4-3-3) Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Rice; Saka, Gyokeres, Martinelli. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Mosquera, Timber, Lewis-Skelly, Merino, Nwaneri, Trossard, Madueke, Havertz. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha start, Benjamin Sesko is on the bench. Rasmus Hojlund isn’t in the squad. Mason Mount is also included, probably as the left-sided No10 with Bruno Fernandes playing deeper. That said, Sky have the United team with Mount as a false nine. With Andre Onana still recovering from a hamstring injury [edit: that’s not the case, see Ruben Amorim’s pre-match interview], Altay Bayindir is in goal. Man Utd (3-4-2-1) Bayindir; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha. Subs: Heaton, Fredericson, Heaven, Maguire, Mainoo, Ugarte, Amad, Zirkzee, Sesko. Hello, hello and welcome to live coverage of Manchester United v Arsenal at Old Trafford. Broadly, there are two ways to view this game: It’s the game of the weekend, a humdinger between two of English football’s Holy Trinity. A perfect way to start the season! It’s 15th v 2nd based on last season’s league table. Why’s everyone getting so excited? We’re in camp 1. The thought of an unenticing match between Manchester United and Arsenal at any stage of the season does not compute. And this isn’t any stage: it’s the opening weekend, a window in time when everything is hope and hope is everything. Right now Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres, Bryan Mbuemo, Martin Zubimendi and all the other new signings exist solely in the imagination of supporter, silhouettes of football perfection who will take United and Arsenal to the next level. The last time these two met on the opening weekend was 36 years ago – Michael Knighton, Neil Webb and all that – so this is kind of a big deal. That 1989 match, won 4-1 by a United side who soon fell into a relegation battle, is a reminder that we shouldn’t get carried away with today’s result. That’s exactly what we’ll be doing, isn’t it. Kick off 4.30pm.
