  Tony Blair’s leaked presence at the recent White House discussion of Donald
  Trump’s “Gaza Riviera” plan is either good news or outrageous. Good news if he
  used his influence with Trump to terminate this obscenity. Dreadful news if he
  were to be party to it. The plan itself was first outlined to an incredulous
  world by Trump in February. The details have now emerged. It involves the
  expulsion – the de facto imprisonment – of 2 million Palestinians, while the
  US administers the exclave for 10 years. Each Palestinian would be paid $5,000
  each plus four years’ rent somewhere else and one year’s supply of food. Gaza
  is then rebuilt as a skyscraper wonderland of artificial intelligence
  investment and tourism. It would be a second Dubai yielding up to $400bn for
  developers. The scheme’s private contractors would be the same “humanitarian”
  trust now supplying food to the famine-hit territory. Trump said that the
  Palestinians would be better off “living beautifully in another location”. The
  Americans might one day see a “reformed and deradicalised Palestinian polity …
  ready to step in its shoes.” It is inconceivable that the plan would be deemed
  acceptable anywhere, apart from in Israel. All parties to any war have a moral
  obligation to plan for its aftermath. As the principal sponsor of Israel’s
  reaction to the Hamas atrocities of October 2023, the US is now party to the
  destruction of over 90% of Gaza’s built environment and the killing of 63,000
  of its inhabitants. As moral obligations go this must border on unprecedented.
  But when Israel eventually occupies all of Gaza, it and the US will doubtless
  claim victors’ rights to do as they please. If morality might have been off
  the agenda at Blair’s White House meeting, the question is: was reality
  present? There are plenty of possible futures already being mooted for Gaza.
  They include one backed by Egypt and the Arab League states for its $53bn
  reconstruction. Another might be a reversion to the 1993 Oslo settlement,
  which has been periodically undermined by Hamas and Israel. Another might
  conceivably include some coalition of Palestinian and Israeli development
  interests under Israeli control. No realisable plan can involve the mass
  clearing of any land of its historical population and its theft for
  colonisation by an alien power. Gaza could never be a second Dubai. It would
  be an embattled ruin plagued by factionalism and terror. For 10 years
  Washington would be responsible for an embattled building site, until it got
  bored and left it to its fate, as it did Saigon, Baghdad and Kabul. The United
  States may be the world’s most successful state but its attempts at
  imperialism have been dismal. The first was in the 1900s when Teddy Roosevelt
  approved the takeover of the Philippines and coveted parts of the Caribbean
  and Latin America. Attempts to police the world have constantly led to mission
  creep into prolonged bouts of intervention. General MacArthur almost succeeded
  in invading China during the Korean war. Having a global presence went to the
  head of George HW Bush in Kuwait, when he declared a ‘new world order’ under
  American control. He generally acted in keeping with his army chief, Colin
  Powell’s, later warning that “if you break it, you own it” but he still
  invaded Somalia. His son, George W Bush, followed his foreign policy adviser
  Condoleezza Rice’s plea that America’s armed forces not be used as “a global
  police force. They are not the world’s 911 [call centre]”. Bush agreed until
  al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks had him and his neocon colleagues itching for war and
  nation-building. In Iraq he promised to deliver a democratic Iraq, greater
  American influence in the Middle East and settlement of the Israel-Palestine
  conflict. America for a while “owned” south Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and,
  for a brief while, Lebanon, all at horrendous cost and loss of life. In every
  case, the gulf between the stated goal and its realisation was enormous.
  Noninterventionism has a long and respectable history in the US. Every
  president toys with it until the trumpets of glory and the sheer power at
  their disposal summons them to war. The most recent and near hysterical
  anti-interventionist was none other than Donald Trump. His hostility to Nato
  collectivism, his tariff wars and turning against Ukraine, demonstrated a
  near-obsession with detaching the US from the world’s ills. Not for him the
  Kennedy/Johnson mission to liberate the world and bring “freedom”. As recently
  as last May in Saudi Arabia, Trump excoriated “so-called nation-builders [who]
  wrecked far more nations than they built … intervening in complex societies
  that they did not even understand themselves.” He told his Arab audience that
  the Middle East had been created “by the people of the region themselves …
  pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies.” At the time
  he was arming Benjamin Netanyahu to the teeth. Gaza faces an awesome task of
  reconstruction, and yes, the US has a moral responsibility to assist. But
  Trump has dreamed up a colonial intervention that not a single Arab – or other
  western – state is likely to support. It seeks merely to validate and
  capitalise on Netanyahu’s horrific invasion. It is lurching down the same grim
  road taken by one American president after another. The only question is: did
  Blair say so? Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on
