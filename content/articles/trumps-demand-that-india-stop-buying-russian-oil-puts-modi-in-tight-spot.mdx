  The relationship between India and the US is facing one of its most
  significant challenges in decades, as the Trump administration doubles down on
  its demands that India stop buying Russian oil or face punitive tariffs. The
  US president, Donald Trump, has refused to cut tariffs on Indian exports to
  the US, as he has for other countries, and on Monday said he would
  significantly raise them over its purchases of cheap Russian oil, which now
  account for one-third of its imported oil. “They don’t care how many people in
  Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,” he said in a post to his
  Truth Social network, also accusing India of selling Russian oil “on the Open
  Market for big profits”. In a previous social media tirade last week, he said
  of Russia and India: “They can take their dead economies down together.”
  Appearing on Fox News on Sunday at the weekend, his hardline deputy chief of
  staff, Stephen Miller, did not hold back as he took direct aim at India,
  stating that Trump had made it clear “it is not acceptable for India to
  continue financing this [Ukraine] war by purchasing the oil from Russia”. The
  whiplash the last few days have caused in the corridors of New Delhi is
  palpable. It was only February when India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was
  one of the first world leaders to be hosted by Trump and the two men embraced
  each other and hailed their “great friendship”. Indian officials were adamant
  that Russia had not even come up in trade negotiations until Trump’s public
  outburst. India had come to view the US as one of its strongest and most
  reliable partners, united by the bonhomie between its leaders and growing
  cooperation on everything from regional security and defence to bilateral
  trade, intelligence, technology and an increasingly powerful Indian diaspora
  in the US. A united geopolitical ambition to counterbalance the power of China
  had only brought them further together under recent presidents. Yet it did not
  go unnoticed by India that China – the other big buyer of sanctioned Russian
  oil, which also has leverage over the US in the form of rare earths – has not
  received similar threats, and neither has Turkey. Trump’s moves have been met
  with a frosty, if not outright defiant, reception among Indian officials.
  After Trump told reporters he had heard India would “no longer” be buying
  Russian oil, he was swiftly contradicted by Indian officials over the weekend,
  who said there would be no change in policy. Under India’s “non-alignment”
  foreign policy it has maintained a close partnership with Russia over decades
  while strengthening ties with the US; a position largely tolerated by
  Washington and reiterated by Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for India’s
  foreign ministry, following Trump’s threats. “Our bilateral relationships with
  various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the
  prism of a third country,” said Jaiswal. “India and Russia have a steady and
  time-tested partnership.” In a column in the Indian Express, Shyam Saran, a
  former Indian foreign secretary, did not mince his words. “Donald Trump was
  supposed to be good for India in his second presidency,” he said. “He has
  turned out to be a nightmare.” Saran was among those who called for India to
  follow the example of China and Brazil and stand up to Trump. He insisted that
  although there would be “pain in resisting Trump … we should be prepared to
  endure it”. “Submitting to his exaggerated demands, which are now political as
  well as economic, would severely undermine India’s national interests,” said
  Saran. “We cannot give any country a veto over which countries India should or
  should not partner with.” It is widely agreed among analysts that Modi has
  been put in an unenviable position by Trump; either acquiesce to Trump’s
  demands and see loss of face domestically or reject them and face sky-high
  tariffs – and possibly other punitive actions – that would cripple the Indian
  economy. The Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta said India was not
  the exception in mistakenly thinking that “Trump is purely transactional and
  that by placating him, pandering to his ego and giving him good headlines, it
  will be enough to make him quietly dial back”. One of the major sticking
  points for Modi, he said, was the highly public nature of Trump’s threats,
  which had complicated the possibility of backdoor negotiations over India
  quietly moving away from buying Russian oil and arms. He said Trump had
  already “frankly humiliated the Indian prime minister” over the recent
  India-Pakistan conflict in May, where Trump had publicly taken the credit for
  negotiating a ceasefire – a position vehemently denied by the Modi government
  in the aftermath. Trump’s recent embrace of Pakistan, signing deals with
  India’s enemy on cryptocurrency, mining and oil – and even having the temerity
  to suggest India may one day buy Pakistani oil – as well as hosting the
  Pakistan army chief for lunch in the White House, had only added insult to
  injury. Mehta said suspicions towards the US in New Delhi now resembled those
  of 1971, when President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry
  Kissinger, sent warships to India in what is considered one of the lowest
  points of the US-India relationship. “The damage is already done,” said Mehta.
  “No matter what deal they come to now, distrust of the US is only going to
  continue to skyrocket.”
