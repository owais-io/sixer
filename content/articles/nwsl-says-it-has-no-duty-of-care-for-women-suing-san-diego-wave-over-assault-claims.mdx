  In a filing last month, the National Women’s Soccer League denied all
  allegations contained in a lawsuit brought by former San Diego Wave employees
  and called for the suit to be “dismissed in its entirety,” claiming that the
  league has “no duty of care” to the six women suing the club and the league.
  The 2024 suit contains allegations of sexual assault of an employee by a
  co-worker while both employed at the club, along with claims of sexual
  harassment, racial discrimination, disability discrimination, failure to
  investigate and prevent harassment and discrimination. In the answer to the
  allegations filed on 8 July to the Superior Court of California in San Diego,
  the NWSL’s legal representatives, Los Angeles firm Arentfox Schiff, deny that
  the six former Wave employees were “damaged or harmed” because of any act of
  the league. The NWSL’s lawyers claim “the doctrine of consent,” inferring that
  the sexual assault and harassment claims were based on consensual encounters,
  and also that certain allegations are beyond California’s statute of
  limitations. The NWSL’s defense also claims it had no duty of care to San
  Diego Wave employees as any incidents that occurred were between the
  individuals and the club – not the league. According to legal experts
  interviewed by the Guardian, the NWSL’s response to the lawsuit is a catch-all
  answer that aims to cover all possible angles of defense. “The defendant has
  simply listed every affirmative defense that could apply to any of the
  claims,” said Professor David Oppenheimer, clinical professor of law at the
  University of California, Berkeley School of Law. “The common term for such an
  answer is ‘boilerplate.’ The purpose is to preserve any conceivable defense.”
  An NWSL spokesperson said the league could not comment on pending litigation.
  Arentfox Schiff did not respond to requests for comment and clarification. The
  six women who filed the lawsuit include one who claims she was sexually
  assaulted by a San Diego Wave co-worker, another who claims she was sexually
  harassed by the same co-worker, and Brittany Alvarado, a former videographer
  for the Wave, claiming workplace-related violations. Three other women are
  named in the suit for similar alleged violations. Alvarado brought attention
  to the workplace environment at San Diego Wave after she posted on social
  media in 2024 that the “NWSL must take immediate action to remove Jill Ellis
  from both the San Diego Wave and the league entirely.” Ellis, the former USWNT
  head coach, was Wave president at the time of the events alleged in the
  lawsuit and had a hands-on role in managing the club. Ellis has since departed
  San Diego to take a senior role at Fifa as its chief football officer. Ellis
  is not a defendant in the lawsuit but is named within it, described as having
  “set an abusive and toxic workplace culture” and “once asking random men in
  Kansas City about their penises”. (Ellis has filed a separate defamation suit
  against Alvarado based on her social media post.) The Guardian previously
  revealed that a 2024 investigation by the NWSL into San Diego Wave management
  found that the club’s front office “could have done more” to address a sexual
  assault allegation but found no specific issue with how the claim was handled
  because the alleged victim did not use the term “sexual” when describing her
  experience. The San Diego Wave is a co-defendant in the case with the NWSL. As
  reported by the Guardian, Jane Doe 1 alleges that a night out in San Diego
  with a co-worker led to “inappropriate activities including a game of ‘Sexy
  Jenga’ that led to him pressuring her into non-consensual sexual acts”. Jane
  Doe 1 alleges that later at her apartment, while she was drunk, she was
  pressured into “sexual activity that she explicitly stated she did not consent
  to”. The NWSL’s defense argues that consent was given. Under California law,
  consent requires an individual to freely give agreement to engage in sexual
  activity “and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or
  transaction involved.” Another woman, “Jane Doe 2”, alleged in the lawsuit she
  was sexually harassed by the same San Diego Wave employee who this time sent
  her non-work related messages and images via Snapchat that became increasingly
  sexual in nature. Jane Doe 2 claims she was terminated by the club after she
  did not work the minimum number of shifts in her non-full-time role – shifts
  that were assigned by the alleged harasser. “In a negligence case, consent is
  a potential defense when the plaintiff has agreed to participate in an
  activity knowing that there are significant risks of harm, and willing to
  subject themselves to them,” Oppenheimer said. “The best examples come from
  sports, but for the athletes … In this case, for the statutory claims under
  the civil rights laws, there is no defense of consent.” Oppenheimer offered a
  hypothetical scenario for the NWSL to launch a successful defense: “[The]
  defendant proves that as each employee was hired they were warned, ‘You need
  to know that this is a toxic workplace. We permit emotional and sexual
  harassment, we retaliate against people who complain, and we fire people in
  bad faith. If you don’t want to subject yourself to this, don’t work here.’
  That might be enough to defend themselves on the negligent hiring and
  management claim, but it would subject them to liability on the statutory
  discrimination claims.” The defense also claims the case should be dismissed
  because the plaintiffs delayed bringing the lawsuit and that a two-year
  statute of limitations under California law should be enforced. The earliest
  claims made in the case took place in mid-2022. The suit was filed in October
  of 2024. The NWSL’s lawyers cite a section of California code of civil
  procedure stipulating that there is a two-year statute of limitations to sue
  for “An action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an
  individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.” California law
  stipulates elsewhere that there is a 10-year statute of limitations for
  criminal sexual assault claims (the NWSL case in question is civil). The NWSL
  claims it cannot be held accountable for events described in the lawsuit
  because they fall outside the relationship between the league and the Wave.
  The league claims it did not know the incidents occurred nor should it have
  known. The former San Diego Wave employees have requested a trial by jury.
