  It’s a journalist’s role to stay behind the scenes. But sometimes, a
  reporter’s extraordinary life becomes the story itself. Such is the case with
  Brent Renaud, an award-winning documentary film-maker who was the first
  American journalist killed, at the age of 51, in the Russia-Ukraine war. His
  life and death are captured in a new, intimate documentary that debuted in Los
  Angeles at the 21st annual HollyShorts film festival earlier this month. The
  film, entitled Armed Only With a Camera, is directed by Craig Renaud, Brent’s
  younger brother, who worked alongside him for more than 20 years, and produced
  by the photojournalist Juan Arredondo, who was there on the day Brent died. It
  explores Brent’s time as a journalist and documentarian reporting worldwide
  from places such as the US-Mexico border, Haiti and Ukraine, relying heavily
  on the footage Brent filmed during their travels. The brothers’ work has won a
  multitude of awards including an Emmy, a Peabody, two duPont–Columbia awards,
  two Overseas Press Club awards, an International Documentary Association (IDA)
  award, a Webby and an Edward R Murrow award. After setting out to follow a
  family in Ukraine for an independent film the brothers were producing, Brent
  and Arredondo were gunned down by Russian soldiers on 13 March 2022. Arredondo
  was heavily wounded; Brent was shot in the neck and did not survive.
  “According to the driver, [the ambush] wasn’t more than five minutes,” said
  Arredondo. “But for me, it just felt an eternity.” The film captures harrowing
  scenes from that day, filmed by Brent in his last moments. The events
  following the attack were filmed by Craig and Christof Putzel, a producer of
  the film and trusted colleague who worked alongside the Renaud brothers in
  many conflict zones over the years. Arredondo, despite his injuries, was
  determined to give an accurate account of what happened to his friend. “The
  bullet came through, entered the body, and at that point, I started fainting,
  because I was profusely losing blood. I kept telling people: ‘Where’s my
  friend? He’s back. Please go get him,”’ Arredondo said. “And when I finally
  came to my senses, the first thing was I needed to call Craig. I made a
  purpose in my mind to be as accurate as possible, because I wasn’t sure if I
  was going to survive.” Craig left the United States shortly after to retrieve
  Brent’s body and his final recordings from Ukraine, and bring them to his home
  town in Arkansas. “I remember packing to leave for Ukraine frantically,” he
  said. “And I remember looking over at my camera. I could hear Brent so
  clearly: ‘Of course you’re taking your camera.’” Craig wanted to make sure he
  captured his brother’s story in its entirety. Brent’s life work is showcased
  throughout the documentary, including clips that often capture the stories of
  civilians caught in the crossfire. Archival footage of Brent and his family as
  he grew up give the audience a glimpse into who he was in front of the camera,
  not just behind it. The decision to turn Brent’s story into a documentary was
  an easy one for Craig, he said: “We spent our entire career, over 20 years,
  documenting other people caught in these wars. Why would it be any different
  when it’s my family member or my brother being killed? It was an instinctual
  thing.” In addition to Brent’s story, the film highlights the growing risks
  that journalists face around the world during what the Committee to Protect
  Journalists (CPJ) has called the deadliest time to tell the truth. The
  committee has reported that 15 other journalists died in the Russia-Ukraine
  war from 2022 to 2023. CPJ has also reported that at least 124 journalists
  were killed in 2024 – the majority of them in Gaza – surpassing the previous
  record of 113 journalists killed in 2007, when almost 50% of casualties were
  attributed to the Iraq war. Brent’s dedication to the craft of journalism
  continued until his final breath, said Craig: “When Brent died, I was at peace
  with his death immediately. There was no part of me that felt like this isn’t
  how Brent was supposed to die. You know, he was the most dedicated journalist
  I’ve ever known. That being the end to Brent is poetic.” Craig and his family
  have started the Brent Renaud Foundation, which aims to continue Brent’s
  legacy by mentoring youth on the arts of storytelling and cinema, as well as
  training the next generation of journalists for the difficult work that lies
  ahead of them. “Without journalism, there is no democracy. I hope people, when
  they see this film, really think about where we are as a nation and in the
  world with journalism,” said Craig. Armed Only With a Camera: The Life and
  Death of Brent Renaud has just received the Audience award at SXSW and will be
  available to stream on HBO on 21 October 2025
