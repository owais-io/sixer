  mental health’

  “It’s difficult,” says Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw. “Sometimes you have to take a
  step back and think about you and your mental health because if you’re not in
  a good place you won’t be able to perform. I wasn’t in a good place. It was
  about more than what happened in that match. There’s a lot that people didn’t
  and don’t know about.” Shaw is speaking for the first time about her decision
  to withdraw from Manchester City’s League Cup semi-final against Arsenal in
  February, four days after she had suffered horrific racist abuse following a
  4-3 loss against the same side in the Women’s Super League. Manchester City
  said they were “appalled” and reported the matter to the police. “It was
  pretty scary to some extent,” adds Shaw, the WSL top scorer in the past two
  seasons. “But I’m lucky enough to have my family, my friends and those that
  care about me close. They’ve been there and supported me and helped me
  throughout that tough period.” The Jamaica international wants to see more
  done to protect players, particularly female players, who don’t have the same
  levels of security or representatives to run social media accounts for them as
  male players do. “There needs to be a lot more accountability as well because
  we can only talk for so much,” says Shaw. “We can do our actions on the pitch
  but if it’s the same cycle of abuse over and over again then they’ll feel they
  can always get away with it. We need the higher-ups to do something about it
  because otherwise year on year on year we’re going to see more of the same.”
  Shaw, the human at the centre of the storm, is not ready to talk about the
  details of what she faced or where her head was at, and there should be no
  pressure on her to ever have to do so. Sitting at a table set up on the astro
  of City’s indoor pitch, Shaw shares the frustration that the onus is on her,
  or Jess Carter, or other Black players, to speak up on racism. “It’s not
  right,” she says. “There was more to it all than what the vast majority knew
  and, when I have time and when it’s right, I’m definitely going to speak on
  it. For now I just want to focus on the season and the first game.” Ambitions
  for the new season are high. Last campaign, with a disappointing City side
  crippled by injuries and a little rudderless, Gareth Taylor was sacked on the
  eve of four back-to-back games against the eventual treble winners, Chelsea.
  City’s former manager Nick Cushing stepped in but they finished trophyless and
  fourth in the WSL table, one point behind Manchester United, missing out on
  Champions League qualification. Andrée Jeglertz, who was in charge of Denmark
  at the Euros, is the coach charged with guiding them through their next phase.
  Sometimes change, regardless of what it is, is needed. “100%,” says Shaw. “You
  find that we have energy we didn’t have before. For whatever reason, I don’t
  understand why. The energy has definitely been different and definitely been
  better, possibly because it’s new and we don’t know what to expect. That
  drives the training more every day.” The Swedish coach has been clear about
  what he wants to see. “He’s made it known from the get-go exactly what he
  wants from this group,” says Shaw. “He told us that he’s not trying to change
  us dramatically as players. We’re just trying to grasp the information and
  implement it as best as possible on the pitch to ensure when the first game
  comes, we are at least at a level to go out and perform at our best.” Shaw was
  one of the many City players sidelined last season, with a foot injury meaning
  she started only 10 league games. Despite that she shared the golden boot with
  Arsenal’s Alessia Russo, having scored 12 goals before her injury. “It was
  definitely my weakest season,” she says. “I started the season really well and
  unfortunately I had an injury that was out of my control, a fractured foot.
  Can’t really do much with that. I didn’t know I’d won the golden boot until
  the last day, on the pitch when they announced it, because that was nowhere in
  my thought. I was mentally not in a good place because I knew I couldn’t help
  the team the way I wanted to; as a player that’s what you want to be able to
  do, to be available for every game.” The small silver lining to the injury was
  the chance to rest body and mind after a lot of football. “Jamaica isn’t close
  either,” she says. “Having to travel all that way back and forth is difficult,
  especially when you come back and have to play every three or four days. I was
  tired. Come November I’d played every game, I was definitely tired. Physically
  and mentally it can be a lot.” Now, though, the 28-year-old is feeling
  refreshed going into the new campaign. “Body’s feeling good, I feel positive
  and mentally I’m in a good place,” she says. She is also looking forward to
  developing her on-pitch relationship with Vivianne Miedema, which was only
  glimpsed last season. “We spoke about it and I think we only played three full
  games together, which is crazy,” says Shaw. “We’re both in a good place at the
  moment, so it’s just about building now and then coming into the season,
  hopefully we’re ready.” The pair will strike fear into the heart of every
  defence in the league, starting with Chelsea in the WSL opener at Stamford
  Bridge on Friday. Shaw is dismissive of the narrative last summer that
  questioned whether they could play together. “I definitely say we can play
  together, I don’t know why people questioned who will start. Viv is not just a
  goalscorer, she can also assist goals, she likes playing in the No 10.” The
  goal this season could not be clearer: win the league. “It’s City we’re
  talking about,” says Shaw. “The ambition has to be there. It’s always fine
  margins. Two years ago we lost the league on goal difference. So it’s not like
  we’re far off. “No Champions League is the reality. We’re in this position, we
  have a game every Sunday and that game should be the most important and that’s
  how we’re going to attack each game. Ultimately we have no excuse to not go
  and win the league.”
