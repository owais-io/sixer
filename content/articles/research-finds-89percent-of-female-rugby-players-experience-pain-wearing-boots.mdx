  Wearing boots designed for men causes discomfort for a majority of female
  rugby players, according to new research which finds as many as 89% of
  athletes experience pain from boots not built for women’s feet. With the
  Women’s Rugby World Cup coming to England in just over two weeks’ time IDA
  Sports, a footwear brand designed for female athletes, called out what it
  describes as the “iniquity” of boot design that leaves women not only lacking
  comfort when playing but exposed to a heightened risk of injury. After
  scanning nearly 1,000 feet, of amateurs and players from across Premiership
  Women’s Rugby, and surveying a further 330, IDA Sports found that comfort was
  the driving factor behind a player’s boot choice, but one that was rarely met.
  While 78% said comfort was a top priority, nearly nine in 10 spoke of
  discomfort. “The findings of our many years of research and development …
  illustrate the inequities that women athletes face when it comes to footwear,”
  Laura Youngson, co‑founder and chief executive of IDA Sports, said. “We hope
  that the findings of this study will not only draw attention to the impactful
  data, but push more brands to invest in women athletes as we have proudly done
  over the last seven years.” About 45% of players surveyed said they
  specifically experienced pain under the first metatarsal bone, above their big
  toe. This is conventionally the location for a stud on a boot intended for a
  man. Youngson has said that female players will often file down the stud under
  the toe to reduce the pressure on the bone and IDA Sports adopted a different
  template for the studs on its female-centred boots. Sports scientists have
  also drawn attention to the risk of injury from studs not adapted specifically
  for women. Women’s feet and arches are shaped differently to men and women
  also run in a different way. Studs under the metatarsal can risk injuring the
  bone, but also possibly increase the chance of damaging ligaments. Dr Matt
  Whalan, a consultant to Fifa on female health in football and a principal
  partner at Figtree Physiotherapy, explained these risks to the Guardian in a
  2020 interview. “The simplest thing to do is to look at the contact with the
  ground and the step/pivot/twist,” he said. “There’s maybe a 10-kilo weight
  difference between male and female footballers and we’re going to put them in
  a same boot, that has the same traction, the same stiffness and that needs the
  same muscle capacity to control the traction that that boot will give. “If
  you’ve got a stud that is 15mm long and you’re leaning really hard and having
  to change direction but you’re 10 kilos lighter, do you need studs that long
  to get the same sort of traction? When you’re getting a lot of traction that
  you don’t need then that’s when you start to put things at risk.”
