  judgment day

  When Jair Bolsonaro was Brazil’s far-right president, the guerrilla trumpeter
  Fabiano Leitão would stalk him around the capital, Brasília, to taunt him with
  renditions of the anti-fascist anthem Bella Ciao. In March, when Bolsonaro was
  charged with plotting a coup, Leitão changed his tune and began provoking the
  ex-president by serenading him with Chopin’s Funeral March. “It symbolises his
  political demise, which is what we want to see,” said the 46-year-old
  musician. Now, as the supreme court prepares to decide whether to send
  Bolsonaro to jail for that alleged power grab, Leitão is cooking up another
  performance to commemorate the populist’s downfall and disgrace. “It’ll be
  something happy! It has to be something happy!” enthused the trumpeter,
  crooning one of the upbeat samba classics he was considering to mark the
  occasion. “Cry! I won’t care!” smirk the lyrics of Vou Festejar. “I’m going to
  celebrate your suffering [and] your grief!” Leitão is among millions of
  progressive Brazilians who have the metaphorical champagne on ice ahead of the
  widely anticipated conviction of Bolsonaro and seven alleged co-conspirators
  when their judgment begins this week. Seven years after the former paratrooper
  swept to power on a wave of social media-fuelled anti-establishment voter
  rage, and three after voters removed him from office, Bolsonaro is careering
  towards the lowest point of his 35-year political career. On Tuesday, five
  supreme court judges will convene in Brasília to rule on whether Bolsonaro is
  guilty of masterminding a failed coup after losing the 2022 election to his
  leftwing opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – and, if so, how long he should
  spend in jail. Legal experts believe Bolsonaro’s conviction is all but
  guaranteed during a judgment expected to last five sessions, between 2
  September and 12 September. His sentence could reach 43 years, meaning the
  70-year-old grandfather could spend the rest of his life behind bars.
  Bolsonaro stands accused of five crimes including involvement in an armed
  criminal organisation, coup d’état and violently attempting to abolish
  Brazilian democracy. Prosecutors have claimed one part of the sprawling
  conspiracy, codenamed Operation Green and Yellow Dagger, included plans to sow
  chaos – and justify a military intervention – by murdering Lula, his
  vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, and Alexandre de Moraes, a supreme court
  judge, who is now overseeing Bolsonaro’s trial. Federal police investigators
  allege the pro-Bolsonaro coup only failed because the heads of the army and
  air force, Gen Marco Antônio Freire Gomes and Brig Gen Carlos de Almeida
  Baptista Júnior, refused to take part. The navy commander Adm Almir Garnier
  Santos, who is one of the seven alleged accomplices also standing trial, has
  been accused of offering his support, charges he denies. “The [prosecution’s]
  closing arguments are really hard-hitting – there’s so much evidence … It’s
  really hard to imagine an acquittal,” Eloísa Machado, a constitutional law
  expert from the Getulio Vargas Foundation law school, said of Bolsonaro. Such
  predictions are music to the ears of Leitão, the activist trumpeter, who hopes
  judges will throw the book at a politician he blames for trying to wreck
  Brazilian democracy and destroying Brazilian lives. During Bolsonaro’s
  2019-2022 presidency, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians were killed by a
  Covid pandemic that the ex-president was accused of mishandling with his
  anti-scientific response and sluggish purchase of vaccines. “It’s going to be
  a moment of joy to see the country free itself of this instrument of
  destruction,” said Leitão, whom fans call the “Trompetista” – a play on the
  words “trumpeter” and “petista”, as members of Lula’s Worker’s party (PT) are
  known. “We always complain about our democracy and how fragile it is. But
  we’re doing much better than the United States, which never arrested Trump.”
  In the run-up to this week’s judgment, Donald Trump, who is Bolsonaro’s most
  powerful foreign friend, has waded into the courtroom drama, imposing
  sanctions on Moraes, the justice leading the trial, and 50% tariffs on
  Brazilian imports in protest at the supposed “witch-hunt” against his ally.
  “It’s really a political execution that they’re trying to do with Bolsonaro,”
  Trump declared recently. Bolsonaro’s third son, the congressman Eduardo
  Bolsonaro, has relocated to the US and busied himself lobbying Trump officials
  to target Brazil’s top tribunal and Lula allies such as the health minister,
  whose wife and daughter were stripped of their US visas. “Trump is our only
  way out,” the president of Bolsonaro’s Liberal party, Valdemar Costa Neto,
  recently told reporters. Analysts believe the US coercion campaign will fail
  to sway the judges who will decide Bolsonaro’s fate. In a rare interview on
  the eve of the judgment, Moraes vowed to shrug off US pressure. “There isn’t
  the smallest of possibilities of retreating even one millimetre,” he told the
  Washington Post. “We’ll do what’s right: we’ll receive the accusation, analyse
  the evidence, and who should be convicted shall be convicted, and who should
  be absolved shall be absolved.” Bolsonaro, who was placed under house arrest
  in early August after violating a court order banning him from using social
  media, denies engineering a coup. He has admitted considering “alternative”
  ways of retaining power after his election defeat. The ex-president continues
  to insist he will challenge Lula for the presidency in next year’s election,
  although the supreme court has already barred him from seeking office until
  2030 for spreading disinformation. After hearing that Bolsonaro had been
  confined to his mansion a short drive from the presidential palace he once
  occupied, Leitão grabbed his trumpet and rushed to the scene. As night fell,
  the musician raised his instrument to his lips outside the gates of
  Bolsonaro’s home and played an unusually cheery excerpt from Chopin’s Piano
  Sonata No 2 into the night. “The message is that it’s over,” the guerrilla
  trumpeter said after his work was done. “I’m holding his political wake – and
  the burial is imminent.”
