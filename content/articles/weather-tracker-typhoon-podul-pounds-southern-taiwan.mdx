  Typhoon Podul crossed southern Taiwan on Wednesday with wind speeds of up to
  110mph (177km/h), equivalent to a category 2 hurricane. Podul had developed a
  week earlier, near the Northern Mariana Islands, and tracked west across the
  Philippine Sea, achieving typhoon status on Tuesday before making landfall in
  south-east Taiwan the following day. Podul whipped up high waves along the
  east coast, where a man died after being swept away while fishing. As the
  storm travelled overland, it dumped large amounts of rain across the south of
  the island, with 440mm recorded in parts of Pingtung County, causing
  widespread flooding and agricultural damage. Schools, offices and businesses
  closed as the storm approached, and more than 7,000 people were evacuated from
  their homes, mainly in mountainous regions, amid fears of flash flooding and
  landslides. Almost 300,000 homes lost power, shipping routes were suspended,
  and about 400 flights were cancelled, including domestic trips. Podul then
  veered north-east across the Taiwan strait and weakened slightly to a severe
  tropical storm, before making landfall once again in Fujian province, China,
  in the early hours of Thursday. Despite weaker winds, Podul lashed south-east
  China with similarly torrential rain – Macau on the south coast recorded 110mm
  in an hour. Cape Verde experienced similar downpours on Monday after Tropical
  Storm Erin developed nearby, causing flash flooding on the north-west islands
  of Santo Antão and São Vicente. The latter received 193mm of rain within five
  hours, more than 150% of the yearly average. At least nine deaths have been
  reported, with several people missing and about 1,500 displaced. Erin will
  pass to the north of the Caribbean over the weekend, and is expected to
  achieved hurricane status. Meanwhile, as a heatwave grips the Middle East, the
  Dead Sea and Jordan Valley have particularly suffered in recent days. The
  region is susceptible to high temperatures because of its low altitude – it is
  several hundred metres below sea level in places – and temperatures approached
  50C (122F) on Wednesday. Unusually high humidity – about 80% at times – has
  contributed to the sweltering temperatures. As humid air cools more slowly
  than drier air, overnight cooling has been limited, leading Israel to record
  its highest overnight minimum on Wednesday, when it reached 38C near Mount
  Sodom. Temperature records were also set in southern and western Europe this
  week as yet another heatwave swept the continent. Alongside myriad date
  records, several all-time peaks were hit in southern France on Sunday and
  Monday, including in the department of Aude (43.4C) and the cities of
  Angoulême, Bergerac and Bordeaux (42.1C, 42.1C and 41.6C respectively). Also
  on Monday, it reached record highs in the Croatian cities of Šibenik (39.5C)
  and Dubrovnik (38.9C).
