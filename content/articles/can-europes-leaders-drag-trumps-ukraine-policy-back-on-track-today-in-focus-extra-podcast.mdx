  Last week, the US president, Donald Trump, flew to Anchorage, Alaska, to meet
  the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. All guns blazing, Trump promised there
  would be consequences if he did not get the ceasefire he had come for. But
  after spending three hours in the subartic chill with Putin, a former KGB
  handler, he seemed to change. He said he agreed with Putin that a long-term
  peace settlement was more urgent than a ceasefire, and ruled out Ukraine
  joining Nato. Europe’s key leaders have responded by ripping up their
  schedules and insisting on joining Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he travels to
  Washington for his own meeting with Trump, the Guardian’s senior international
  correspondent Julian Borger explains. Helen Pidd asks what hope this “dream
  team” of leaders has of convincing Trump to listen to the Ukrainian
  president’s pleas for a ceasefire.
