  South-east Queensland has been shaken by a 5.6-magnitude earthquake. There was
  no tsunami threat from the earthquake that struck on Saturday morning, the
  Bureau of Meteorology said. The epicentre of the quake was at Kilkivan, west
  of Gympie, about 170km north-west of Brisbane, at 9.49am. The quake struck at
  a depth of 10km, according to Geoscience Australia data. More than 16,000
  “felt reports” had been registered as of Saturday afternoon, from as far away
  as Brisbane and the Gold Coast to the south, and Bundaberg to the north. “I
  don’t think anybody expected to wake up to that today in Queensland,” the
  state premier, David Crisafulli, said on Saturday. “There’s been some amazing
  stories that have come through and we obviously are waiting to see … damage
  and we hope everyone is OK.” Michelle Salmon, a seismologist with Geoscience
  Australia, said the only stronger recent earthquake was an offshore temblor in
  2016 near Bowen in the state’s north. “This is the largest earthquake we’ve
  had onshore in Queensland for 50 years,” she said on Saturday. “We can
  certainly expect more aftershocks from this event.” Across the Sunshine Coast,
  Brisbane and the Gold Coast, people reported their houses shaking and a low
  rumble. Sue Krucker was home in Mount Mellum on the Sunshine Coast – 100km
  from the epicentre – when the quake struck. Krucker said she had lived through
  13 cyclones, and was intimately familiar with the safety precautions for
  those, but earthquakes were highly unusual for Queensland. “I was sitting in
  our home office, and the first thing I noticed was our printer activated, and
  then one of the pot plants started to shake. “It was moving like a Mexican
  wave, from one thing to the next: the printer, the plant, my chair, my desk,
  my monitor. It kept progressing. Then my phone came up with an earthquake
  alert. It was almost a surreal moment. “It lasted quite a while. Doors were
  moving. This house is a split-level Queenslander – the house was definitely
  moving. And when I went to stand up, my legs were shaky, I felt like I was on
  a rocky boat. And for sometime afterwards, I felt like my equilibrium had not
  been restored.” Krucker said her brother lived in Japan, which regularly
  experiences severe magnitude earthquakes. “I’m mindful that other people go
  through things like this, and they are often much more extreme. This is
  unusual for here, but no one here is harmed, nothing’s damaged. I haven’t
  detected any cracks in the house. We are all safe and OK.” Krucker said an
  8.8-magnitude earthquake had struck Russia a fortnight ago, flooding rains
  were devastating Pakistan, while wildfires raged in southern Europe. “An
  earthquake is highly unusual for here. It feels like Mother Nature is out of
  kilter.” Nearly 13,000 homes and businesses in south-east Queensland were left
  without power after the earthquake, Ergon Energy said. “Crews are working to
  return supply as soon as possible.” Earthquakes above magnitude five occur
  every one to two years in Australia, with an average of 100 quakes at
  magnitude three or lower recorded each year, according to Geoscience
  Australia. A 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded on Victoria’s Mornington
  Peninsula on Wednesday, after a 3.6-magnitude earthquake recorded west of
  Kingscote in South Australia on Tuesday. - with AAP
