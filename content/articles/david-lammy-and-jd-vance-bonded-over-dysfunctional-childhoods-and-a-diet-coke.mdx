  David Lammy has spoken of his friendship with the US vice-president, JD Vance,
  as the pair can relate over their “dysfunctional” working-class childhoods. In
  a series of interviews with the Guardian, conducted over several weeks, the
  foreign secretary opened up about a “wonderful hour and a half” spent with
  Vance over drinks at the US embassy in Italy in May alongside the deputy prime
  minister, Angela Rayner. Lammy said he had been to mass at Vance’s home and
  counted him as a “friend”, saying the vice-president “relates” to him over
  their shared background. “I remember being at the inauguration of the new pope
  in Rome with Angela Rayner and JD Vance,” he said: “I don’t think JD and
  Angela will mind me saying that they were having a couple of drinks … I really
  wanted a glass [of rosé] but instead I had a Diet Coke.” The foreign secretary
  said they were all “not just working-class politicians, but people with
  dysfunctional childhoods”. “I had this great sense that JD completely relates
  to me and he completely relates to Angela. So it was a wonderful hour and a
  half,” he said. In his interview, Lammy spoke of feeling guilty over the
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s, highly awkward first meeting with
  Donald Trump and Vance in the Oval Office, where the men berated him over the
  war. “If I’m being honest, I felt, arrghhh!” Lammy said. “Why hadn’t I done
  more to support our Ukrainian colleagues in preparation for their meeting?… I
  was being a bit hard on myself. But I still felt guilty.” The foreign
  secretary also touched on his discomfort over Keir Starmer’s “island of
  strangers” speech about immigration, which drew criticism that the prime
  minister was echoing the rightwing politician Enoch Powell. “I think the use
  of language was poor,” he says. “Poor choice. And if someone had shown me the
  speech, I would’ve said, ‘Take that out’.” On the subject of Gaza, Lammy spoke
  of his “days of deep frustration, deep sadness” over the war with Israel. He
  said things were “desperate for people on the ground, desperate for the
  hostages in Gaza”, that the world was “desperate for a ceasefire, for the
  suffering to come to an end”. He also said he “100 per cent” wanted to go to
  Gaza “as soon as I can get in”. Speaking before the government decided to move
  on to a path to recognise Palestine as an independent state, the foreign
  secretary described it as a “card you can only play once”. In the interview,
  the Lammy looked back over his career and his difficult childhood, including
  the effect of his father – an alcoholic who was violent towards his mother,
  and who left for the US. “My father didn’t come back. Psychologically that is
  devastating. There must have been a bit of me that blamed myself. I question
  whether he did, in fact, love me.” His father later died of throat cancer
  without his son seeing him again. Lammy said he could not emotionally handle
  the idea of it at the time, but added: “I’m quite a forgiving person, my
  nature is wanting to build bridges, to reach out. It’s why I think I’m not bad
  at this role.” He described his sense of purpose as foreign secretary, saying:
  “This is the first time in my life where I do not have impostor syndrome. I
  genuinely have a sense of being in the right place at the right time for this
  job.”
