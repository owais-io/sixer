  It’s not often that you discover a new species in your lunch spot. But for Lou
  Jost, co-founder and director of Fundación EcoMinga, that’s exactly what
  happened. Everything from a new species of glass frog to a new mammal genus
  have been discovered on the Ecuadorian reserves that Fundación EcoMinga
  protects with funding from the conservation charity World Land Trust – but it
  all began with orchids. “When you’re sitting still, you observe things much
  more carefully,” says Jost. “I saw all these leaves that I recognised as
  orchid leaves.” Turning them over, he found flowers that “looked more like
  insects”, counting five different orchid species without leaving his spot. “It
  opened my eyes to the biodiversity of these orchids,” says Jost, and on a
  later hike to the same area, he spotted something strangely beautiful he’d
  never seen before – a brand new species. “I named it Lepanthes elytrifera,
  which means ‘carrying beetle wing covers’, because the centre of the flower
  looks like a pair of shiny beetle wing covers.” But to Jost, who’d been
  fascinated with orchids since childhood, even growing a DIY rainforest in his
  basement, it was obvious that this new species was threatened. “From where I
  was sitting, I could hear the sound of chainsaws.” Over the next decade, while
  Jost mapped out the patterns of orchid biodiversity, he felt an obligation to
  ensure the survival of these areas and their endemic species. He approached
  the local government and the body responsible for managing Ecuador’s national
  parks, but “kept running into brick walls”. So, in 2005, he and a group of
  Ecuadorian and international scientists and conservationists founded Fundación
  EcoMinga, with “some small reserves and small donations”. But scaling up was
  an issue – until World Land Trust stepped in, when he approached it for
  funding to protect 2,000 hectares (4,900 acres) of vital habitat. “Almost
  immediately, they agreed,” he says. World Land Trust has funded the protection
  of 29,036 hectares of land in Ecuador through its partners. EcoMinga alone
  manages 10 reserves in the upper Río Pastaza watershed, a biological corridor
  linking the northern and southern ranges of Ecuador’s eastern Andes. There, it
  has discovered nearly 100 species, almost all of which are found nowhere else
  but the watershed. EcoMinga also manages two more reserves in the Chocó region
  of north-west Ecuador, and it is here that one of its recent mammalian
  discoveries took place. Discovering Pattonimus Rodents are often overlooked in
  science, says Jost. But Ecuadorian mammologist Jorge Brito knows only too well
  the hidden biodiversity they represent. Alongside EcoMinga’s executive
  director, Javier Robayo, and “highly trained, highly motivated guards from
  Baños de Agua Santa”, Brito led an expedition to the Dracula reserve in the
  Chocó region, near the Colombian border, to investigate the amphibians,
  reptiles and mammals in the area. As a result of the expedition, the
  researchers identified a new species of rodent. “We knew that what we found
  was probably a new species,” he says. But it was the morphology of its teeth
  that led the team to understand they had actually discovered a new rodent
  genus, Pattonimus. “Even globally, that’s quite rare.” Discoveries on World
  Land Trust-funded reserves include the Norma Ewing’s rain frog, identified
  last year by EcoMinga’s reserve manager, Juan Pablo Reyes-Puig,during a
  research expedition to Cerro Candelaria. And announced this year, the luminous
  green Maycú torrent frog, discovered where the Andes meets the Amazon in the
  Maycú reserve by a team of researchers. In 2020, the ethereal,
  translucent-skinned mindo glass frog was also rediscovered in EcoMinga’s Rio
  Manduriacu reserve, seen just twice in the wild since it was first described
  in 1975. The reserve, originally intended to protect the critically endangered
  Tandayapa Andean toad, is now a breeding ground for these otherworldly
  creatures. Another is the scorpion species discovered during a community
  patrol by Asociación Ecológica de San Marcos de Ocotepeque in western
  Honduras, and named Centruroides lenca in honour of the Indigenous Lenca
  people. Finding amphibians “It is really hard to discover new species … but
  not as hard as I thought,” says Jost, recalling his favourite find on an
  expedition to a remote, little-studied mountain in the World Land
  Trust-protected Machay reserve. “It’s a very special mountain, very steep –
  almost nobody has ever been,” says Jost, who was ascending with a team when a
  guard named Darwin Riccardo came running with something in his hands. “A big
  black frog with fluorescent dots all over it. Such a crazy frog. I had no idea
  there was anything like this in the world!” Riccardo had spotted it inside a
  bromelia plant. “It still blows me away!” A frog by any other name And as for
  the name of that thrilling spotted frog? Hyloscirtus sethmacfarlanei, named in
  honour of the actor Seth MacFarlane, who also works to halt the loss of
  rainforest habitat. “You can do a lot with new species. They’re
  attention-getters. There are actually websites that track things that are
  named after David Attenborough,” he says, adding that he, too, has named a
  plant after Attenborough, a World Land Trust patron – the Blakea
  attenboroughii. “I often name species after people or communities,” says Jost,
  recalling how an orchid named after the city of Tulcán in Ecuador made the
  news. “The city printed colourful children’s books with pictures of all the
  fancy frogs, birds and plants, and the garbage collectors handed them out,” he
  says. Tulcán even painted its municipal vehicle to match. Sharing that
  curiosity and pride on a global scale could be a tonic for anyone feeling
  despondent about the loss of natural habitats. Jost insists there’s room for
  optimism. “Every significant ecosystem in the Río Pastaza watershed of Ecuador
  is now at least partly preserved by these reserves.” And EcoMinga’s reserves
  are growing, protected rigorously by World Land Trust’s Keepers of the Wild
  rangers. “All of the World Land Trust’s partners are an inspiration for the
  world. The diversity here is so high that you can’t just pay attention to one
  area,” says Jost. “You’ve got to have one decentralised system of partners
  focusing on different animals and plants and areas – and that’s what World
  Land Trust does. And it’s working.” You can support projects like the Rio Anzu
  Reserve by donating to the World Land Trust Action Fund – conservation where
  it’s needed most
