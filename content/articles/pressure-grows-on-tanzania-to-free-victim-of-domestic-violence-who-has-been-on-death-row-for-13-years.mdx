  Pressure is mounting on the Tanzanian government to release a woman with
  severe intellectual disabilities who has been in prison awaiting execution for
  13 years. Lemi Limbu, who is now in her early 30s, was convicted of the murder
  of her daughter in 2015. A survivor of brutal and repeated sexual and domestic
  violence, she has the developmental age of a child. Limbu’s legal team is now
  worried about her deteriorating health. On a visit to the prison in June, one
  of her lawyers found that Limbu required assistance to walk, her stomach was
  swollen and her mental health had worsened. “She looked sick, weak and sad,”
  the lawyer said. In Tanzania, the death penalty is the mandatory sentence for
  murder. Limbu’s original conviction in 2015 was nullified in 2019 due to
  procedural errors. But she remained incarcerated awaiting a new trial. In
  2022, she was retried and sentenced to death a second time. The court did not
  consider her intellectual disabilities or history of abuse. An appeal was
  filed in 2022 but no date for a hearing has been set. “The constitution of the
  United Republic of Tanzania requires courts to not delay dispensation of
  justice unreasonably,” said the lawyer. “According to our laws, justice should
  not only be done, but be seen to be done.” “This is a woman who absolutely
  should not be in prison,” said Prof Sandra Babcock, a clinical professor of
  law and the faculty director of the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty
  Worldwide, who is acting as a legal consultant in Limbu’s case. “This is a
  woman who is not violent, who represents no threat. You could release her
  tomorrow, and, as long as she had some kind of support for her disability, she
  would be able to live a reasonably productive life in society. She is somebody
  who needs protection.” A coalition of 24 African and international human
  rights groups earlier this year condemned Limbu’s sentence as part of an
  appeal to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights to look at the plight
  of women on death row throughout Africa. Limbu grew up in an environment of
  violence. Her father beat her mother and she was repeatedly raped by men in
  her village, who would drag her from her home. She gave birth at 15 after
  becoming pregnant by rape. At about 18, she married an older man and had two
  more children. She later fled from her husband, who beat her, and moved to a
  different village with her youngest child, Tabu, who was about a year old.
  There she met Kijiji Nyamabu, an alcoholic, who told Limbu he would marry her
  – but he said he would never accept her baby daughter, Tabu, because she had
  been fathered by a different man. Shortly afterwards, Tabu was found
  strangled. There were no witnesses and Kijiji had already fled by the time
  Limbu brought the authorities to her daughter’s body. She was arrested in
  August 2011 but Kijiji was never detained. At her first trial in 2015, Limbu
  pleaded not guilty. Unable to read or write, she said she did not know the
  contents of a statement that police claimed she had made admitting to the
  murder. She said she was beaten, threatened at gunpoint and detained for two
  days at the police station. At her 2022 retrial, the high court did not allow
  evidence from medical professionals. A clinical psychologist who evaluated her
  had concluded she had a severe intellectual disability and the developmental
  age of a 10-year-old child or younger. Under international law, Limbu should
  not be held criminally liable, given her intellectual disability. Prison
  conditions in Tanzania are “dire”, according to Fulgence T Massawe, director
  of access to justice at the Legal and Human Rights Centre, a Tanzanian
  advocacy organisation. He said that in terms of supplies and sanitation,
  conditions in prisons were bad and the prevailing belief was that it was not a
  hotel “and people are here to serve their term”. ” In a letter requesting a UN
  special rapporteurs appeal to the Tanzanian government, Babcock wrote:
  “Without urgent intervention, the poor standard of care Limbu is receiving
  creates an unacceptable risk that her condition will deteriorate further and
  become critical.” She said Limbu’s case was “a clear example of the profoundly
  unjust consequences of Tanzania’s mandatory death penalty”, adding: “Limbu has
  been a victim of abuse since childhood and is uniquely vulnerable because of
  her intellectual disability.”
