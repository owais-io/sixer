  The Guardian view on the other Afghan scandal: countries are forcing refugees

  The British public discovered only very belatedly that an enormous accidental
  data breach by an official three years ago put up to 100,000 Afghans at risk
  of torture and death. Some of them had worked with British forces in
  Afghanistan. The result was that thousands were secretly relocated to the UK.
  A superinjunction covered up the story for almost two years. But the shocking
  security lapse is far from the only example of Afghans being failed since
  Kabul fell to the Taliban in 2021. Many more are now at risk because the
  countries to which they fled are pushing them out. The mirage of a more
  moderate Taliban was soon shattered by their imposition of gender apartheid
  and the brutality faced by minorities. Three-quarters of the population
  struggle to meet their daily needs. Women are particularly vulnerable.
  Humanitarian support is being slashed. A drought and now the loss of overseas
  remittances are deepening the crisis. Yet almost 2 million Afghan refugees and
  migrants in neighbouring countries have returned or been forced to return home
  this year alone – thousands of them unaccompanied children, according to UN
  experts. More than 1.5 million Afghans have returned from Iran in 2025, with
  Iran accelerating expulsions after the war with Israel, which fed suspicion
  towards migrants. Pakistan began deporting unregistered Afghans in late 2023,
  after attacks by militants in border areas, but has widened its campaign to
  those who hold documents. More than two-thirds have never lived in
  Afghanistan, according to the International Crisis Group; their families fled
  conflict decades ago. In some cases, security forces are forcibly repatriating
  Afghans. In others, threats, harassment or intimidation have chased them out.
  The Trump administration has announced the removal of temporary protected
  status from almost 12,000 Afghans in the US, though an appeals court has for
  now blocked it from doing so. The US said that conditions in Afghanistan no
  longer merited the status. Tajikistan has also ordered Afghans to leave. UN
  experts have warned that former officials, including judges and lawyers, human
  rights defenders and journalists and other critics of the Taliban, along with
  religious and ethnic minorities, are at particular risk if they are returned.
  Women and girls are being deported to a country where they can no longer
  attend secondary school or university and are prohibited from letting their
  voices be heard outside the house, and where the EU has estimated that basic
  health services are available to just 10% of women. By driving women out of
  jobs and severely restricting their movements, the Taliban have ensured that
  female-headed households face destitution. The prospect of return is
  particularly frightening for women’s rights activists who face imprisonment or
  death for their work. Pakistan and Iran should not force Afghans home –
  endangering lives and ending education for girls. But other governments too
  bear responsibility for this crisis. Poorer nations have been left to shoulder
  the strain of a high number of refugees, some of whom are in limbo due to
  Germany’s closure of a humanitarian admission programme, and the bureaucracy
  surrounding a similiar programme in Australia. This has been a triple failure:
  a failure to welcome Afghans with a strong case for resettlement; to support
  them in countries which have accepted them; and to help those who are
  returning to Afghanistan. Western countries must live up to their promises to
  the Afghan people. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
