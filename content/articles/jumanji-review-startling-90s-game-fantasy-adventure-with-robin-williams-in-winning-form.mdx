  Jumanji review – startling 90s game fantasy adventure with Robin Williams in
  winning form
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  The Jumanji franchise has been enjoyably revived in the last few years, but
  the new reboot films don’t have the purely startling quality of the original
  fantasy-surreal adventure from 1995, now rereleased for its 30th anniversary.
  Adapted from a 1981 children’s picture book by Chris Van Allsburg, it starred
  Robin Williams in an exuberant, winning but notably controlled lead
  performance. This is an entertainment in the broad Hollywood tradition of
  Capra and Spielberg, with a boisterous touch of Peter Pan in that the stern
  father figure and the scary villain are both played by the same actor. But
  there’s something else, too, a dash of something that, if it were played
  straight, would be genuinely creepy. And actually, even played just the way it
  is, it’s still pretty creepy. Williams plays Alan Parrish, a guy who in his
  childhood of the late-1960s found himself marooned inside the bizarre internal
  world of a crazy Kiplingesque board game called Jumanji. A couple of recently
  orphaned kids, Peter and Judy (played by Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst),
  chance upon this musty old game in the attic of their new house; they roll the
  correct numbers on the dice and release the crazed and disoriented Alan, whose
  strange and presumably jungle-dwelling garb is the only direct clue we will
  have to what his life has been like inside. But it isn’t just Alan who gets
  out; the game also disgorges a lot of nasty insects, crazy monkeys, rhinos,
  lions, icky venom-spitting plants and a rifle-wielding pith-helmet-wearing
  colonial-era Brit, played (like Alan’s stern dad) by Jonathan Hyde. The only
  way to get them all back inside is to continue the game that Alan started as a
  kid, to the end. And to do that they will have track down the now grownup
  woman that Alan was playing with at the time: the intensely messed-up Sarah
  Whittle, played by Bonnie Hunt. All those crazy creatures rampaging through
  the streets of a sweet little town makes for quite a bizarre spectacle and, 30
  years later, the visual effects hold up rather well, despite or because of not
  approaching the uncanny-valley standards of what could be achieved now. And
  this weird game is also like something MR James might have dreamed up if he
  had worked in Hollywood. As for Williams himself, his wild-man routine is only
  in evidence in his opening scenes; otherwise he dials it down, perhaps sensing
  that the way to upstage the loony creatures is to be relatively rational.
  There is something touchingly innocent in his performance. • Jumanji is in UK
  cinemas from 5 September.
