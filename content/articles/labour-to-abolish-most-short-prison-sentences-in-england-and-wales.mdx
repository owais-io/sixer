  Ministers will legislate next month to abolish most short prison sentences,
  toughen up community punishments and introduce a Texas-inspired system whereby
  inmates can earn early release as part of an attempt to avert another prison
  crisis. Government sources said the legislation, which will bring about the
  biggest shake-up in sentencing laws in England and Wales for three decades,
  would be introduced once MPs had returned to the Commons in September. They
  said Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, was conscious of the need to
  implement the changes quickly before prisons had another capacity crunch next
  summer. Thousands of inmates were released after Labour won power last summer
  in an emergency measure to deal with overcrowding. The sentencing bill will
  include measures backed by the government that were recommended by the former
  Conservative justice secretary David Gauke in a review in the spring. The
  central change will be the introduction of an incentive scheme – or “earned
  progression model” – for prisoners serving fixed-term sentences to earn early
  release with good behaviour. Criminals, including some violent ones, will be
  able earn early release after serving between a third and half of their
  sentence, though the most dangerous criminals and those convicted of
  terror-related offences will be excluded. The scheme is modelled on a system
  in place in Texas, which Mahmood visited earlier this year. The bill will also
  end short sentences of less than 12 months, barring exceptional circumstances,
  with ministers arguing that these are counterproductive and a driver of more
  crime. The latest data released by the Ministry of Justice last month
  suggested that for the prison cohort of July to September 2023, 62% of inmates
  released after serving sentences of less than 12 months went on to reoffend.
  The government also plans to toughen up community punishments by giving courts
  greater flexibility to impose fines, seize assets and introduce bans on
  travel, driving and attending football matches. Mahmood wants there to be an
  expansion in the use of unpaid work, where councils would be able to assign
  jobs to offenders such as filling potholes and removing graffiti. Suspended
  sentences are to be allowed for up to three years instead of two, and will be
  used more for low-risk offenders with high needs such as pregnant women and
  people with substance abuse problems. The bill will include measures to limit
  the movement of sexual and violent offenders upon release by pinning them down
  to specific “restriction zones”, policed using technology and enhanced
  tagging. Ministers have also announced plans to deport most foreign criminals
  immediately after conviction instead of 30% of the way through their
  sentences. Critics argue this would allow them to evade punishment. Meanwhile,
  Mahmood will press ahead with a voluntary chemical castration system for sex
  offenders in England and Wales, and is exploring the prospect of making it
  mandatory. The programme is being piloted in two regions. A government
  spokesperson said: “This government inherited a prisons system days away from
  collapse. That is why we are building 14,000 more prison places – with 2,500
  already delivered – but we know we can’t build our way out of this crisis.
  Without further action, we will run out of prison places in months, courts
  would halt trials and the police cancel arrests. “That is why as part of our
  plan for change, we are overhauling sentencing to make sure we always have the
  prison places needed to keep the country safe.” England and Wales together
  have the highest per capita prison population in western Europe. Gauke has
  said that without change, prisons could run out of space again by spring.
