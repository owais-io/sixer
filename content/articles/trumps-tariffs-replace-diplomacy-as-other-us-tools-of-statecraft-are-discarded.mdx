  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump pledged to use tariffs to revitalise
  American industry, bringing jobs home and helping to make America great again.
  But more than six months into his administration, experts say the president’s
  trade war is increasingly being wielded as a political cudgel, in lieu of more
  traditional forms of diplomacy. The president’s current target, India, has
  been unable to reach a trade agreement, and Trump appears ready to follow
  through with his threat to impose a further 25% tariff on Delhi – bringing the
  total to 50% – the joint highest levy on any country, along with Brazil. It is
  a whiplash-inducing turnaround from a few months ago, when the newly minted
  Trump administration seemed intent on continuing a years-long bipartisan
  effort to deepen ties with India as a geopolitical counterweight to China.
  It’s part of a trend that highlights how tariffs are used as threats against
  countries perceived to be recalcitrant. Rather than a tool of economic
  coercion, Trump instead wields tariffs as a political weapon. Five rounds of
  trade talks between the two sides have brought India no closer to conceding to
  US demands that it open up its vast agriculture and dairy sectors.
  Negotiations planned for early next week have been abruptly called off, as
  India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, grapples with Trump’s demand that India
  cease to buy oil from Russia; sales that the US says are helping to fuel
  Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. The demand – that India wean itself off
  the Russian oil, which accounts for about 35% of its total supply – sits at
  odds with the original stated purpose of Trump’s tariff regime: to bring
  manufacturing back to the US and rebalance trade deficits. “Tariffs have a
  very specific purpose of protecting domestic industry from competition,” says
  Dr Stuart Rollo from the Centre for International Security Studies at the
  University of Sydney. “That’s not really what this is about … It’s kind of
  pivoted to a tool of geopolitical compulsion.” Trump himself has come to admit
  this. Along with the threatened additional 25% tariff on India in retaliation
  for continuing to purchase Russian oil, the president has tied Canada’s 35%
  tariff to its recognition of Palestinian statehood. In the case of Brazil,
  which has a rare trade surplus with the US, meaning it buys more than it
  sells, Trump has said that the huge 50% tariff is due to the trial of his
  political ally, Jair Bolsonaro, who is charged with plotting a military coup
  after he lost the 2022 presidential election. The president’s top trade
  adviser, Peter Navarro, even has a new term for these explicitly political
  trade threats: “national security tariffs”. The Democratic senator Chris
  Murphy put it more bluntly, writing in the Financial Times in April that the
  tariffs are not designed as economic policy but as a “means to compel loyalty
  to the president”. Rollo says: “It’s a way of the United States to compel as
  much of the world as possible into realignment with its global leadership at a
  time when its actual weight and gravity is diminishing.” In some ways, this is
  not new; the Biden administration used trade restrictions to limit China’s
  access to state-of-the-art semiconductors at a time of heated geopolitical
  tensions. But Devashish Mitra, a professor of economics at Syracuse
  University, says that for many in India, the threat faced over Russian oil
  purchases seems incoherent, ill thought out, and could push India closer to
  China. “India did consider the US an ally,” says Mitra. “It was a country that
  the US was relying on as a counter to China in that region. So it had a huge
  geopolitical importance, but it doesn’t seem like Trump values any of that.”
  This week, China’s foreign minister has been in Delhi for talks, and Modi is
  expected in Shanghai at the end of the month, his first visit in seven years.
  It’s a part of a recent pattern of tightening relations between the Brics
  countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which make up 40%
  of global GDP – that experts say is a response to Trump’s aggressive trade
  policies. For future US administrations, winning back the trust of some of
  these countries could be difficult, as Trump’s escalating trade war comes at
  the same time as his administration dismantles its instruments of global
  statecraft. From mass firings at the state department to the slashing of
  foreign assistance programmes at USAID, America’s diplomatic toolbox is vastly
  diminished. Tariffs have “come to replace diplomacy”, says Rollo. And so with
  his attention divided between crises at home and abroad, the president has
  left himself armed with only a hammer, with every global flashpoint looking to
  him like a nail.
