  At least seven people have died, hundreds have been injured and public
  buildings have been burnt and looted after thousands of people took to the
  streets in anti-government protests across Indonesia over the past week. The
  clashes between riot police and rock-throwing protesters that began in the
  capital and quickly spread beyond Jakarta have been seen as a major test for
  President Prabowo Subianto, a former general who has been in office for less
  than a year. What sparked the Indonesia protests? The protests began on 25
  August, with thousands demonstrating outside parliament against a housing
  allowances for MPs that was nearly 10 times the minimum wage in Jakarta.
  Prabowo has simultaneously implemented strict austerity measures, including
  cuts to education, health and public works. Demonstrators were also protesting
  against what they termed “corrupt elites” within the government and policies
  that benefit conglomerates and the military, according to a press releasee
  from the student group Gejayan Memanggil. The statement was an apparent
  reference to the growing role of the military in civilian life under Prabowo’s
  government. The demonstrations spread across the country and turned
  increasingly violent on Friday, after the death of a 21-year-old deliver
  driver in Jakarta. Footage showed a team belonging to the nation’s elite
  paramilitary police unit running him over late on Thursday as it drove an
  armoured car through a group of protesters. What has happened since?
  Government buildings and police headquarters have been set ablaze by
  protesters around the country, with demonstrations taking place in Gorontalo
  city on Sulawesi island, Bandung on the main island Java, Palembang on Sumatra
  island, Banjarmasin on Borneo island, Yogyakarta on Java, and Makassar on
  Sulawesi. At least three people were killed on Friday after a fire started by
  protesters at a council building in the eastern city of Makassar. A fourth
  died in the same city on Friday after he was beaten by a mob who mistakenly
  believed he was an intelligence officer. A student died in clashes between
  riot police and protesters in Yogyakarta on Friday, while a 60-year-old
  pedicab driver suffering from acute asthma was found unconscious after being
  exposed to teargas at a protest in the city of Solo and died on Sunday while
  being treated at a hospital. Over the weekend finance minister Sri Mulyani
  Indrawati’s house was looted, although she was not at home, and several
  lawmakers have reportedly had their houses ransacked. Authorities say they
  have detained more than 1,240 rioters after five days of protests in Jakarta
  while according to the city’s governor, Pramono Anung, the damage as rioters
  burned buses, subways and other infrastructure has caused losses of up to 55bn
  rupiah ($3.3m). He also said 700 people had been injured in the protests. How
  has the government responded? Prabowo, who has cancelled a high-profile trip
  to China to attend a major military parade, on Sunday ordered the security
  forces to take firm action against the protests. “There are signs of unlawful
  acts, even leading to treason and terrorism,” he said. “To the police and the
  military, I have ordered them to take action as firm as possible against the
  destruction of public facilities, looting at homes of individuals and economic
  centres, according to the laws.” However he also announced that lawmakers’
  perks – including the contentious housing allowance – would be cut, as well as
  overseas trips, a rare concession to the protesters. Prabowo also said that
  police were investigating seven officers linked to the incident in which the
  deliver driver died, and that he had instructed a quick and transparent
  investigation in a way that the public can monitor. He said he would ensure
  his administration financially supported the driver’s family. On Monday he
  struck a defiant tone once more, announcing he would promote 40 police
  personnel injured during the violence. “There might be police members who were
  wrong … But don’t forget dozens of officers who sacrificed themselves,” he
  said during a visit to a hospital treating injured police. What has the rest
  of the world said about the protests? The United Nations on Monday called for
  an investigation into the alleged use of disproportionate force at the
  protests, while Human Rights Watch accused the Indonesian authorities of
  having “acted irresponsibly by treating the protests as acts of treason or
  terrorism”. The rights group’s Asia director Meenakshi Ganguly said the
  response was especially concerning “given the security forces long history of
  using unnecessary and excessive forces against demonstrators”. Foreign
  embassies and consulates, including the US, Australia, France, Canada and
  other southeast Asian countries, have issued travel warnings and advised their
  citizens in Indonesia to avoid demonstration areas or large public gatherings.
