  Eating foods rich in potassium, such as avocados, bananas and spinach, could
  reduce your risk of heart conditions, hospitalisation and death by 24%, a
  study suggests. Previous research has shown that cutting out salt from meals
  can slash your risk of heart problems. Reducing the number of meals to which
  you add salt or ditching it altogether can make a huge difference to your
  heart health. Potassium increases the amount of salt your body removes from
  the bloodstream. In a study, scientists set out to understand whether more
  potassium might benefit people by reducing their cardiovascular risk. The
  senior study author, Prof Henning Bundgaard, a professor at Copenhagen
  University hospital, said: “The human body evolved on a potassium-rich,
  sodium-poor diet – when we were born and raised on the savannah and eating
  [fruit and vegetables]. We [now] tend to go to [a] modern diet that is
  processed foods and, the more processed, we see more and more sodium in the
  food and less potassium, meaning that the ratio between the two has changed
  from 10:1 to 1:2 – a dramatic change. “Potassium is crucial for cardiac
  function and we know from observational studies that low potassium increases
  the risk of arrhythmias and heart failures and death. We also know that
  potassium can be increased. “The simple question we asked in the trial was:
  would we benefit the patients by increasing potassium?” The trial involved
  1,200 heart patients in Denmark with implantable cardioverter defibrillators
  (ICDs), half of whom were given dietary advice on how to boost their potassium
  levels. “We have a list [of foods] that we gave to the patients. We followed
  general dietary instructions – [in Denmark known as] the pyramid of foods.
  White beets, beetroots, cabbage and so on are all high-content potassium-rich
  diets. We did not recommend meat, which is also potassium-rich, because it is
  also rich in sodium and counter-interacts the increase in potassium.” A
  dietary increase in blood potassium levels was associated with a
  “significantly lower risk” – 24% – of heart conditions, heart-linked
  hospitalisation or death from any cause, the results showed. They were
  presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid, the
  world’s largest heart conference. Bundgaard said: “With a broader view we can
  say that higher dietary intake of potassium may not only benefit patients with
  heart disease but probably all of us, so maybe we should all reduce sodium and
  increase potassium content in our food.” Dr Carrie Ruxton, a dietitian who was
  not involved with the study, said: “Everyone knows about cutting down on salt,
  but few people realise that increasing potassium is almost as important for
  preventing strokes and heart attacks. “The European Food Safety Authority
  highlighted a lack of potassium across Europe as a major diet concern. In the
  UK, the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey – published this year –
  shows that a third of teenagers and a quarter of adults are at risk of
  potassium deficiency, with implications for blood pressure control and muscle
  function. “We can do more individually to boost our potassium intakes by
  eating more fruit, vegetables and fish. Fruit juices are particularly rich in
  potassium. Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt,
  banana and tuna.” Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and
  clinical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: “This trial from
  Denmark found that increasing blood potassium levels into the high normal
  range in people with ICDs improved patient outcomes, and importantly reduced
  their chances of needing a shock. “If you’re advised by your doctor to improve
  your dietary potassium intake, you can do this by including more vegetables
  and fruit rich in potassium such as spinach, bananas or avocados in your diet,
  as well as pulses, fish, nuts and seeds. “Don’t be tempted to try to increase
  your potassium intake with supplements unless supervised by your doctor, as
  ending up with too high a potassium level is dangerous – for example it can
  cause cardiac arrest.”
