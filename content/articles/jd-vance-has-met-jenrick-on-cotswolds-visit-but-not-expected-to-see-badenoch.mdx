  JD Vance has met Robert Jenrick during his holiday in the Cotswolds but is not
  expected to see the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. Jenrick held an
  hour-long one-on-one meeting with the US vice-president on Tuesday evening,
  according to a source close to the shadow justice secretary. A Conservative
  spokesperson said that Badenoch was also speaking to Vance this week but that
  scheduling time for them to meet in person had proved difficult. Both Vance
  and Badenoch’s teams played down the idea of a snub, but Vance’s decision to
  hold a meeting with Jenrick will raise eyebrows. Jenrick was defeated by
  Badenoch in the Conservative leadership contest last year and is widely
  perceived to harbour continued ambitions for the top job. He has strayed well
  beyond his justice brief and repeatedly caused controversy with his incendiary
  language on migration. There are reports that Vance will also meet Nigel
  Farage, the Reform UK leader, on Wednesday. Farage’s spokesperson did not
  reply to a request for comment. A Conservative source said that Jenrick was
  attending a drinks event with Vance on Tuesday evening alongside others,
  including the former chancellor George Osborne. They said Badenoch had been in
  contact with Vance but that they had been unable to find time for a meeting
  due to diary clashes. The US vice-president spent last weekend with David
  Lammy, the foreign secretary, while Badenoch has been in Epping and the Isle
  of Wight this week. Both Vance and Jenrick have expressed staunch opposition
  to equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and voiced concerns about
  the erosion of freedom of speech. In February, the vice-president claimed that
  a “backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of
  religious Britons” under threat, and he attacked the use of laws to enforce
  buffer zones around abortion clinics. Asked about his remarks before meeting
  Lammy last Friday, Vance claimed that his concerns related more widely to “the
  entire collective west”. Vance is on holiday in the Cotswolds with his family
  and has been pictured visiting the Daylesford farm shop near Chipping Norton.
  Responding to reports that Farage was due to meet Vance, the Liberal Democrat
  leader, Ed Davey, called on Farage to “tell the White House that in Europe we
  stand together against Putin’s aggression”. He added: “But Farage won’t do
  that because he’s much more interested in pleasing Trump than in standing up
  for British values and European security.”
