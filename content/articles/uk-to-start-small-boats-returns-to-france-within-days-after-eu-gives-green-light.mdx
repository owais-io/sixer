  light

  The UK will begin detaining people who arrive on small boats and returning
  some to France “within days” after the EU gave the green light to a deal
  agreed with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The treaty between France
  and the UK will allow the Home Office to return some asylum seekers back
  across the Channel for the first time in exchange for accepting others
  directly from France via a safe route. Those who have crossed the Channel to
  the UK using small boats will become inadmissible for safe routes, according
  to the terms of the treaty. About 50 people a week are expected to be returned
  during the pilot of the so-called “one in, one out” scheme. The Home Office
  said the pilot was “operationally ready” and that detentions could start
  within days. The summer months, when the weather tends to be better, are
  usually the high point for crossings, with 898 arrivals on 30 July alone.
  Since the start of the year, about 25,000 people have sought asylum by
  arriving on small boats across the Channel. The Conservatives have panned the
  scheme, saying the numbers arriving would mean it was the equivalent of “17
  in, one out”. Nationalities at the greatest risk will be prioritised on the
  newly opened safe route and will be subject to full documentation and security
  and eligibility checks. The pilot scheme runs until June 2026, after which
  both the UK and France have said they will assess its future. The final text
  of the deal was signed by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and her French
  counterpart, Bruno Retailleau, last week, and approved by the European
  Commission, which was thought to be a potential obstacle. The UK prime
  minister, Keir Starmer, said the agreement was “the product of months of
  grownup diplomacy delivering real results for British people as we broker
  deals no government has been able to achieve and strike at the heart of these
  vile gangs’ business model. “The days of gimmicks and broken promises are over
  – we will restore order to our borders with the seriousness and competence the
  British people deserve.” Cooper said the government would robustly defend any
  legal challenge, saying it had learned from the failed Rwanda deportation
  scheme under the Conservatives. “This is an important step towards undermining
  the business model of the organised crime gangs that are behind these
  crossings – undermining their claims that those who travel to the UK illegally
  can’t be returned to France,” she said. “It is also right to make clear that –
  while the UK will always be ready to play its part alongside other countries
  in helping those fleeing persecution and conflict – this must be done in a
  controlled and managed legal way, not through dangerous, illegal and
  uncontrolled routes.” The Home Office said preparations for the scheme had
  begun, including clearing space in immigration removal centres, and a new
  operational strategy for Border Force officials to allow them to identify
  which potential asylum seekers would make their claims inadmissible by
  travelling via small boat. Anyone who arrives by small boat and is returned to
  France will not be eligible for the legal route to the UK, while anyone who
  tries to re-enter the UK having already been returned to France once will be
  returned again “as a matter of priority”. The shadow home secretary, Chris
  Philp, said the scheme would have “no difference whatsoever” and blamed the
  rise in Channel crossings on Labour’s cancellation of the Rwanda scheme.
