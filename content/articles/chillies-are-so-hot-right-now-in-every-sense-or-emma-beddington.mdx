  Are we in a chilli arms race? The US is, according to the Atlantic, which
  recently explored the country’s growing enthusiasm for hot stuff (more than
  half of Americans in a survey said they were likely to buy an item described
  as “spicy”, up from 39% in 2015) and killer chillies. Americans have certainly
  thrown themselves into it – I spent an entertaining hour in a Brooklyn hot
  sauce emporium last year having tasting profiles of various skull-emblazoned,
  jokily named bottles earnestly sauce-splained to me by mulleted men– but it’s
  happened in the UK too. Our cupboards and fridges suggest “little treat”
  condiment culture has a masochistic edge: I just counted 19 bottles and jars
  of angry-looking red stuff in ours; I’m forever succumbing to the must-have
  small-batch chilli crisps the algorithm offers. Why? Capsaicin, the active
  component of chilli peppers, supposedly delivers an endorphin buzz, but it’s
  surely more cultural than physiological. We’re all global culinary
  sophisticates these days – no one wants to admit to being the kind of wimp who
  craves flavourless “white people food”. Chilli’s expanding geographic
  penetration has probably been helped along by Hot Ones, the YouTube show where
  celebrities writhe as they submit to ever-spicier chicken wings; Demi Moore’s
  steely, unbothered performance on it merited many Oscars. I suspect
  mouth-boredom plays a part too – there’s so much flavour everywhere now it
  would give my Celtic ancestors heart failure, so our jaded palates crave more
  intense stimulation. But whether you’re a Carolina Reaper eater or intimidated
  by red Doritos, everyone gets a chilli humbling eventually. Mine came,
  humiliatingly, in Paris this spring. “Choose a spice level from one to five,”
  the waiter in a Laotian restaurant said. “Five is really hot. Three is quite
  spicy.” Judging myself reasonably robust, and French people chilli-averse, (I
  should have read Alexander Hurst’s exploration of the new French appreciation
  for hot stuff last year), I went with three and nearly died. Requesting more
  water from the waiter, sinuses brutalised and ears painfully ringing (does
  anyone else get this with chilli?), I rasped out a tearful acknowledgment that
  he was right, it was quite spicy. For days after, my stomach lining demanded
  only the blandest, beigest of white people food. • Emma Beddington is a
