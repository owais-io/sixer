  Irvine Welsh: Reality Is Not Enough review – a candid portrait of a literary
  one-off

  No one would reject the title of national treasure more fiercely, but more
  good-humouredly, than Irvine Welsh. The brilliant Scottish writer and creator
  of Trainspotting takes centre-stage in Paul Sng’s documentary with just the
  same unassumingly athletic ease as in all of his other public appearances. For
  someone who has done as much drink and drugs and as many late nights as Welsh,
  he looks very good. This film is a great way to round off the Edinburgh film
  festival; Welsh is, after all, Edinburgh’s greatest living public figure. His
  60s childhood in Leith and Muirhouse was followed by a spell in London, then
  twentysomething years back in Edinburgh during the 80s, studying at
  Heriot-Watt and working for the council, during which time he began to write.
  Like many other articles or documentaries about Welsh, this one shows us how
  he is an inveterate traveller and globetrotter, unselfconsciously having fun
  in LA and on the international literary festival circuit. It also shows us he
  is someone who has a passionate love of music and sports, which he quite
  genuinely regards as equal in his affections to literature. With other
  writers, Scottish or otherwise, I would regard this as a sneaky affectation, a
  pose designed to bolster side-hustle gigs in longform journalism. But no, for
  Welsh it is quite real; we see him playing football (impressively) and working
  out in a Florida boxing gym (even more impressively), skipping like a
  prizefighter and sparring. We also see him with third wife Emma Currie,
  exchanging teasing gags about how posh she is, although he doesn’t talk about
  his previous two wives. And along with his other enthusiasms, there are drugs,
  about which he is unrepentant; the dodgy street stuff does appear to be a
  thing of the past, although Welsh does not make unambiguous statements on this
  point. One big set piece of this documentary is Welsh’s visit to a special
  clinic in Toronto where he takes the hallucinogen DMT under supervision – and
  the film keeps flashing back to Irvine, wearing an eye mask, in a DMT-trance,
  perhaps suggesting that everything in the film is the kind of personal stuff
  he is re-experiencing. Welsh has clearly done so many interviews that he can
  absorb any question without it discomposing or even surprising him in the
  slightest – but one radio interviewer asks him how he feels about his heroin
  years and how he feels about the people who died as a result of the addiction
  that he encouraged. Welsh pauses, and for a moment I wondered if he was going
  to get angry – and Welsh angry would surely be a very formidable proposition.
  But he answers equably enough that we all take responsibility for our own
  actions. A point that forms an angry exchange in Trainspotting. Welsh does not
  mystify the writer’s art, he is not grand or self-aware about it, in the way
  that many far less talented or successful writers would consider to be a part
  of their vocational entitlement. But there is something oddly opaque in Welsh,
  a learned taciturnity about the creative process which his easy-going
  frankness and unpretentiousness masks. At any rate, he’s an amazing one-off. •
