  Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from first lady Melania Trump to
  Russian leader Vladimir Putin raising the plight of Ukrainian and Russian
  children caught in the middle of the ongoing war between the two European
  countries, it was reported on Saturday. Trump administration officials told
  Reuters the letter mentioned the abductions of children following Russia’s
  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Putin was indicted by the
  international criminal court in 2023, and still faces arrest in 125 countries,
  for his alleged role in the war crime of abducting those children and
  transferring them from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.
  However, the text of the letter, which was obtained and posted online by Fox
  News on Saturday, is extremely opaque and makes no reference at all to the
  abductions or transfer of children from Russian-occupied Ukraine to Russia.
  “Dear President Putin,” the letter begins. “Every child shares the same quiet
  dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation’s rustic
  countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and
  safety from danger. “A simple yet profound concept, Mr. Putin, as I am sure
  you agree, is that each generation’s descendants begin their lives with a
  purity—an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology,”
  the first lady writes. “Yet in today’s world, some children are forced to
  carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them—a silent
  defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future.” Rather
  than appeal to Putin to return the children his government has seized to their
  home country, the letter vaguely implores the Russian president to “restore
  their melodic laughter”. “Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and
  you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen
  today,” Melania Trump’s letter concludes. “It is time.” Slovenian-born Melania
  Trump did not attend the peace summit between Trump and Putin at Joint Base
  Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. But she has previously
  said that her ambition as US first lady was to be akin to Eleanor Roosevelt,
  who was known for her work advocating for children’s rights and welfare during
  Franklin D Roosevelt’s presidency. Ukraine has called the abductions of tens
  of thousands of its children taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territory
  without the consent of family or guardians a war crime that meets the United
  Nations treaty definition of genocide. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, conveyed his gratitude to the US first lady on his call with Trump
  on Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said on Saturday.
  “During the conversation, President Zelenskyy also conveyed his gratitude to
  first lady Melania Trump for her sincere attention and efforts to bring
  forcibly deported Ukrainian kids back,” Sybiha said on X. “This is a true act
  of humanism.” Ahead of Friday’s summit, the White House stated that Russia’s
  abduction of more than 20,000 Ukrainian children “remains a concern” for Trump
  seven months into his second presidency. Moscow has previously said it has
  been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone. The issue returned to the
  headlines earlier in August, when the non-governmental organization Save
  Ukraine accused Russia of “state-sponsored child trafficking” after a group of
  administrators in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine published an online
  catalogue of what they called Ukrainian orphans. Organization head Mykola
  Kuleba said the database from the Russia-installed administration’s education
  ministry in the Luhansk region contains data on 294 Ukrainian children under
  the age of 17 who have been separated from their parents. Kuleba noted the
  website shows the names, photos, descriptions of personalities and hobbies of
  the children. “Russia isn’t even trying to hide it any more,” Kuleba said.
  “It’s openly trafficking Ukrainian children. “The way they describe our
  children is no different from a slave catalogue. This is real child
  trafficking in the 21st century, which the world must stop.” After news of the
  first lady’s letter was reported, the Bring Kids Back UA initiative expressed
  gratitude to Melania Trump for her concern. “Deep gratitude to [the first
  lady] for caring so profoundly about the fate of Ukraine’s children. Each word
  of support brings them closer to their families, communities and home,” it
  said. US lawmakers have demanded the return of Ukraine’s children from Russia
  before any peace deal is agreed to and in July introduced a congressional
  resolution calling for their return. Led by Texas Republican congressman
  Michael McCaul and New York Democrat Gregory Meeks, the resolution condemns
  Russia’s abduction, forcible transfer and facilitation of the illegal
  deportation of Ukrainian children. A US Senate version was introduced by Iowa
  Republican Chuck Grassley and Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat. Meeks
  said “the Russian military has cruelly abducted and illegally deported tens of
  thousands of Ukrainian children from their homeland”. “These atrocities are
  not isolated incidents,” Meeks said. “They are the direct result of Putin’s
  war of choice.”
