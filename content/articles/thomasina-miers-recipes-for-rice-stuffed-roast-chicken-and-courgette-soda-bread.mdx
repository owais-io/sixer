  Little beats a loaf of fresh bread still warm from the oven. Today’s one is
  flecked with courgettes (zucchini), toasted seeds, a pleasing hint of green
  chilli and plenty of cheddar – the more mature, the better. It is delicious in
  the extreme, and even more so when spread with pickled chilli butter. But
  first a year-round roast chicken, inspired by the red rices of Mexico, that
  fills the day with a happy glow. If ever there was a dish to sing for its
  supper … Roast chicken stuffed with tomato rice and smoky oregano butter
  (pictured top) I am endlessly in awe of the amount of umami unleashed by a
  simple braise of tomatoes, garlic and onion. Here, their sticky, sweet juices
  caramelise around the grains of rice and edges of the pan, producing a
  swashbuckling flavour-bomb that looks resplendent when it comes to the table.
  Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Serves 6–8 250g long-grain rice 1 large chicken
  (about 2kg) 40g butter 1–2 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, peeled and roughly
  chopped Sea salt and black pepper 1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and
  finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 50g sun-dried tomato
  paste 1 tbsp chipotle en adobo 1 tsp ground allspice 260g cherry tomatoes,
  quartered, or a 400g tin 500ml chicken stock, or water 200ml white wine For
  the butter 1 fat garlic clove, peeled ½ tsp ground allspice 1 tsp sea salt 1
  handful fresh oregano leaves, or thyme, roughly chopped 1 tbsp chipotle en
  adobo 75g room-temperature butter Soak the rice in a bowl of cold water for 10
  minutes and take the chicken out of the fridge so it comes up to room
  temperature. Put a casserole dish or large saucepan on a medium heat and, once
  it’s hot, add the butter and olive oil. Stir in the onion, season generously
  and sweat, stirring, for about 10 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic, cook,
  stirring, for three to four minutes more, then stir in the sun-dried tomato
  paste, chipotle and allspice. Stir in the tomatoes, then drain the rice and
  add that, too. Stir for a few minutes to coat the rice, then pour in the stock
  or water and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer, cook for 15 minutes, then
  take off the heat. By this time, the tomatoes will have started to break down
  and will be smelling fragrant and delicious, but the rice will not yet be
  fully cooked; you’ll finish it off in the oven later. Heat the oven to 200C
  (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Meanwhile, make the butter: in a mortar or small
  blender, grind the garlic, allspice, salt and herbs to a paste, then work in
  the chipotle and butter until well combined. Put the chicken in a roasting
  tray and loosen the skin around the breast and thighs. Push two-thirds of the
  chipotle butter under the skin, then smear the rest all over the outside of
  the chicken. Stuff the bird with the part-cooked red rice, and scoop any that
  doesn’t fit inside bird into the roasting tray under the chicken. Pour in the
  wine, then roast for an hour and 15 minutes (allow 15 minutes per 500g of
  bird, plus 15 minutes, and you should be spot on), until the chicken is golden
  and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thighs are pierced with
  a skewer. I usually cut between the thighs and body after 35 minutes, to allow
  the insides of the thighs to cook without risk of overcooking the breast. The
  chicken will emerge resplendent with that smoky tomato rice. Carve and serve.
  Courgette soda bread with pickled chilli butter Alongside the roast chicken,
  this loaf, with additional cheese and a sprightly green salad, makes a
  stunning weekend lunch. It is also great slathered with cold salted butter and
  nothing else. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Makes 1 loaf 250g courgettes 200g
  white spelt flour, plus extra for dusting 130g white rye, wholemeal or emmer
  flour 2 tsp sea salt 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda 100g mixed seeds, such as
  sunflower and pumpkin 1½ tsp fennel seeds 120g mature cheddar, grated 2 green
  chillies, finely diced 300ml buttermilk For the butter 250g softened butter
  3–4 large pickled chillies 40g fresh dill, leaves picked 2 tsp sea salt
  Freshly ground black pepper Blitz all the ingredients for the butter in a
  small food processor until fully combined, then roll into a sausage, wrap in
  baking paper and chill until needed. It will keep happily for several weeks in
  the refrigerator. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and put a baking
  sheet inside to heat up. Have ready a sheet of baking paper. Roughly grate the
  courgettes into a bowl, then squeeze them tightly with your hands to get rid
  of any excess liquid. Squeeze again in paper kitchen towels to extract every
  last bit of moisture, then set aside. Sift the flours, salt and bicarbonate of
  soda into a large bowl, then tip anything left in the sieve into the bowl. Put
  a frying pan on a medium heat and, once hot, gently toast the mixed seeds for
  five to six minutes, until they start to crackle and pop. Reserve a few
  tablespoons’ worth, then tip the rest into the flour bowl. Toast the fennel
  seeds in the same pan for a minute, then add to the flour. Tip in the squeezed
  courgettes, cheddar and chillies, and fold until they are all nicely coated in
  the flour. Make a well in the centre of the courgette mix, then pour in the
  buttermilk and, as quickly and deftly as you can, fold it in; the quicker you
  can do this, the lighter the soda bread will be. This is quite a sticky dough,
  so do not lose faith. Turn out on to a floured surface and, with flour-dusted
  hands, shape the dough into a round with authority and speed. Make a cross on
  the top with a sharp knife and sprinkle with the reserved toasted mixed seeds.
  Take the baking sheet out of the oven and line it with the reserved sheet of
  baking paper. Put the soda bread on top and bake for 40–45 minutes, until
  golden and hollow-sounding when you tap the base. Serve with the chilli
  butter. Wrapped and stored in a bread bin, the loaf will keep for several
  days. These recipes are edited extracts from Mexican Table by Thomasina Miers
