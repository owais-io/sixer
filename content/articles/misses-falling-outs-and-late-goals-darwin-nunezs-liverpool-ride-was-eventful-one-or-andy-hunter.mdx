  It started with a goal to clinch the Community Shield against Manchester City
  on his Liverpool debut and a red card for a head-butt on his Anfield bow.
  There were glaring misses, falling-outs and some telling contributions in
  between, before it ended with Liverpool taking a rare financial hit on a
  one-time club record signing. Darwin Núñez never reached the heights Jürgen
  Klopp predicted he would, but it was an eventful three-year ride that ensures
  the striker is poised to depart in the affections of many at Liverpool. Klopp
  led the signing of Núñez before and especially after his two appearances for
  Benfica against Liverpool in the 2021-22 Champions League. But he was not the
  only Liverpool coach to be sold on the Uruguay international’s talents, become
  frustrated by attempts to accommodate the forward and ultimately sideline him.
  Arne Slot followed an identical path with the mercurial 26-year-old. Núñez was
  out of favour long before Klopp left Anfield in May 2024, starting just one of
  the former Liverpool manager’s last seven games and cutting a disillusioned
  figure throughout. There was talk of Liverpool cutting their losses 12 months
  ago. Instead, one of Slot’s first acts as Liverpool head coach was to have a
  video call with Núñez while he was on Copa América duty with Uruguay. The
  striker was flourishing under Marcelo Bielsa and Slot hoped he could also
  unlock the player’s explosive qualities on a more consistent basis. Getting to
  work on Núñez’s fragile confidence, Slot outlined how the forward would be
  central to his plans – literally – operating as Liverpool’s No 9 and not out
  on the left, where he was sometimes deployed by Klopp. Six months later, if
  not before, and Liverpool’s head coach had reached the same conclusions as his
  predecessor. It was not a simple case of Núñez’s erratic finishing driving
  Slot to distraction and falling short of the standards of a team chasing the
  Premier League and Champions League titles, although the latter point is
  undoubtedly true. It was also, as Slot was happy to outline in public, a
  question of style. The explanation he offered in January provides an insight
  into what Liverpool have sought to address and will continue to do so in this
  transfer window, with a replacement for Núñez wanted and a £110m offer for
  Alexander Isak remaining on Newcastle’s table. Slot wants more flexibility and
  Núñez was not able to provide it. “Darwin is a striker we have to use in a
  certain way,” said Slot, “and we were not able yet to bring the best out of
  him this season. He has a lot of pace but, unfortunately for him, most teams
  sit back a lot against us. We are still working on getting him in the best
  possible positions against a low block. That involves the right timings, the
  right crosses, the right position to start from and making the right run.”
  Twenty-four hours after Slot’s admission, Núñez came off the bench to score
  two stoppage-time goals in a 2-0 victory at Brentford that gave Liverpool
  their first league win of 2025. After a faltering start to the calendar year,
  it was an important step on the road to the club’s 20th league title. An
  outrageous chipped finish in the corresponding fixture the season before was
  another reminder of his ability. But it was not showcased consistently enough.
  After the double at Brentford there would be only one more goal from Núñez in
  his final 20 appearances for Liverpool, the equaliser that turned the tide
  against bottom-of-the-table Southampton. He could also have been sent off in
  that game. Núñez’s injury-time rescue act against Brentford and Slot’s honest
  assessment of the striker’s problems came in the same month he pushed to leave
  Liverpool. He and his representatives wanted Liverpool to accept a £60m offer
  from Al-Nassr, not reject it as the club prioritised winning the Premier
  League over cashing in. The same message was relayed to Liverpool this summer.
  Slot criticised Núñez’s work rate – a key factor in retaining the goodwill of
  many Liverpool supporters – against Wolves and Aston Villa in February. Slot
  denied dropping the player from the squad against West Ham in April as a
  result of a training ground row with a member of his coaching staff. There has
  been no faulting the forward’s application and effort this pre-season. Núñez
  returned in excellent shape and has looked sharp in friendlies, though it was
  clearly time for all parties to move on. Liverpool are likely to lose in
  excess of £20m on Núñez. The Anfield club paid a guaranteed £65m for his
  services in 2022 with a further £20m in add-ons. Several bonus payments,
  however, such as for winning the Champions League and after a specified number
  of starts, were never activated. Al-Hilal have agreed to pay £46.3m plus
  add-ons and give a striker in the prime of his career a three-year contract. A
  lucrative move for Núñez and a statement signing for the Saudi Pro League, no
  doubt, but also a waste of a headline-grabbing act.
