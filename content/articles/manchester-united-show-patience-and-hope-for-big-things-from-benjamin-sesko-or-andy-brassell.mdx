  It has, for a while, appeared to be destiny. Benjamin Sesko’s arrival at
  Manchester United was third time lucky for last season’s Europa League
  finalists, having attempted to make a deal for the Slovenia striker when he
  was leaving Domžale in 2019 and again when he agreed to fly the Red Bull
  Salzburg nest in 2022, eventually joining up with RB Leipzig a year down the
  line. Now United have their still-only-22-year-old man and if Sesko has been
  feted in the inner circles of European football since his mid-teens, one could
  suggest the wait has not only be worthwhile but that it could work in favour
  of Ruben Amorim as he attempts to author a dramatic uptick in the fortunes of
  the English game’s premier fallen giant. And now, the time for talking and for
  contemplating is done. United have wanted their headline No 9, and Sesko has
  wanted his chance to shine in England. Both have had their wishes come true
  and both need to prove that their partnership can be a fruitful one because,
  beyond the hype, club and player have a lot staked on this, and really need it
  to work. Sesko’s debut is expected to come at home to Arsenal on Sunday. Ever
  since Sesko arrived at Leipzig in 2023, it was strongly suspected this moment
  would come. From even earlier, perhaps. Sesko arrived in the Red Bull universe
  in 2019, signing his Salzburg deal a few days after turning 16, less than a
  year after Erling Haaland had done the same. Haaland is a figure who
  frequently comes up when discussing and describing Sesko; not just because of
  entrusting his development to Red Bull’s finishing school but because of their
  comparative athletic profiles. Both men are 6ft 5in, both have the build that
  would suggest they would be traditional target men and both have lightning
  pace that one doesn’t expect from a player of that stature. Yet from there,
  they diverge. If the physical characteristics of Haaland and Sesko are
  slightly misleading, so is the suggestion that they are similar players. The
  Norwegian, from his first steps in the Salzburg first team, had looked like
  the goal machine he has proved to be so emphatically in Dortmund and
  Manchester. Sesko, his successor, never really looked like doing the same,
  even if he struck 16 times in 30 Austrian Bundesliga games in his final
  Salzburg season. What Sesko lacked in sheer goal volume, though, he made up
  for in his all-round game, which outstripped that of Haaland when he was in
  Austria (or Germany for that matter). In terms of running the channels,
  linking with teammates in the final third and being an authentic part of the
  team rather than just a penalty box predator, Salzburg-era Sesko was clearly
  the brighter bet. It was entirely legitimate, however, to wonder how regularly
  he might score in Germany after making the move to Leipzig. The big success of
  his time with Leipzig was his arrival as a consistent goalscorer in a top
  European league. A pair of six-week droughts, one in autumn, another in early
  spring, meant he ended up with a lower Bundesliga tally last term than in his
  debut season, 13 compared with 14, but his ability to be decisive and make
  proper use of his natural gifts – strength, speed, a thunderous shot, the
  ability to peel away from defenders with the adroitness of a smaller man and
  ability in the air when required – has been clear. Sesko’s spell in the
  Bundesliga, like Haaland’s, always felt like a loan in all but name and
  contractual detail. More than a finishing school, it was more a waiting room
  until an inevitable move to the Premier League. Mikel Arteta’s longstanding
  interest in Sesko was no secret but the arrival of Andrea Berta at Arsenal
  (with his record of going big on established centre-forwards) shifted the
  club’s focus to Viktor Gyökeres, which opened the door for United to try again
  for Šeško. The past two young forwards with hoped-for big futures who were
  lured to Old Trafford – Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirkzee – have hardly been
  resounding successes, so there must be real scrutiny on whether United can be
  the right club for Sesko and whether the player has made a wise choice. If
  some have questioned his decision to join a club without European football
  this season – which would have been the same had he stayed at Leipzig – it is
  really about the medium term. Højlund and Zirkzee are two among countless
  examples of talented players who have arrived at Old Trafford and not become
  the players they were expected to be. One could argue that Newcastle were
  Sesko’s safer bet, given that his aim will be for his Premier League
  trajectory to mirror that of Alexander Isak, transforming strong potential
  into all-conquering product. Amorim has successfully developed players beyond
  their wildest dreams (Gyökeres being the most famous example) so perhaps he
  can do so again, with a pre-season behind him and a squad more shaped to his
  liking. Sesko’s temperament gives him a great chance; throughout this summer’s
  transfer saga he behaved in an exemplary fashion at Leipzig, with the sporting
  director, Marcel Schäfer, underlining this week that “his move is a loss both
  from a sporting and a personal perspective”. His success in the Premier League
  would be a significant corner turned for this latest United rebuild.
