  If you visited the V&amp;A’s Design/Play/Disrupt exhibition in 2018, you may
  have played an interesting minigame collection, in which you fought wobbly
  physics to feed a girl named Jenny, using a Tetris-style board to achieve the
  perfect calorie amount, and then twisting her into pilates poses. Almost seven
  years later, the full version of Consume Me, which won this year’s Independent
  Games festival grand prize, is set for a September release. According to
  developer Jenny Jiao Hsia, the game has become a semiautobiographical tale
  about how she felt “stupid, fat and ugly” in high school. What started as a
  collection of minigames about Hsia’s struggles with dieting and disordered
  eating grew into a game that looks at the many facets of her life as a
  teenager, including her relationship with her mother – who appears accompanied
  by Persona-style boss battle music and always finds a reason to nag – as well
  as her insecurities around her first long-term relationship. Hsia and
  co-designer Alec “AP” Thomson have been making games together since their time
  studying at NYU Game Center. The duo conceived of Consume Me when Hsia showed
  Thomson old diaries featuring her calorie charts and notes about dieting. “I
  said, ‘Hey, doesn’t this look like a game?’,” she recalls. Thomson agreed. “We
  had a little prototype and then we got funding, and the game grew from there,”
  says Thomson. As Hsia and Thomson grappled with the challenge of making their
  largest game yet, the years went on. “The last big project we worked on
  together was essentially a student game for us,” Thomson says. That game was
  Beglitched, a match-three puzzler from 2016. “Compared to that, our whole
  process on Consume Me is completely different.” Hsia is self-depreciating
  about the experience: “On Beglitched, I physically worked next to AP every
  day, and I was happy to let him tell me what to do. My set of tasks on this
  and our smaller games was very clearcut – [with Consume Me] I had to take more
  responsibility. I don’t think I’m a very disciplined person, that’s why it
  took so long.” Hsia stresses that Consume Me wasn’t a way for her to work
  through her issues with disordered eating, as she had left that time of her
  life behind before she started development on the game. Instead, she thinks
  that working from her own experiences makes for a more interesting story. “I
  think it’s boring if you’re just inventing something from your mind without
  any tangible experience, or at least I don’t have the imagination to do that,”
  she says. “The character of Jenny you see in the game isn’t solely based on
  me, either. She’s very much an amalgamation of AP and myself. She’s very
  diligent about reaching goals and crossing things off her list for example,
  because that also makes for a good game, but in reality, it’s AP who’s more
  like that, not me. I wrote all those calorie diagrams down, but I didn’t
  actually follow them.” Hsia seems surprised at the idea that a lot of Consume
  Me feels very relatable. People who have difficulty concentrating will
  probably see themselves in the reading minigame, in which Jenny’s head
  perpetually rotates away from the book she’s holding. There also just never
  seems to be quite enough time to do it all, and more often than not, Jenny’s
  budget comes down to a lucky 20-dollar bill she finds on the street in a
  minigame that sees her walk her dog around worrying amounts of poop. Jenny’s
  habit of finding money on the streets of New York is apparently another
  well-documented facet of Hsia’s own life. “I don’t actually know what people
  will take away from it,” she says. “That’s the interesting thing to me. You
  cherrypick parts of your life to show to complete strangers, and then you
  watch them react.” • Consumer Me is released on PC on 25 September
