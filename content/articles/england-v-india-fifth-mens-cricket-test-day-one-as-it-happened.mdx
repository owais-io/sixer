  Righto, that’s us done for today. Ali Martin’s report will be in here and
  on-site shortly, so do check back for that, but otherwise, thanks all for your
  company and comments, sorry I couldn’t use them all, and see you tomorrow,
  headbands donned, for Thorpey Day. On which point, we’ll get into it again
  then, but as below, if anyone needs an ear a chat or a mate, you know my
  email. Peace out, people. It might not seem this way, but there’s loads of
  mileage left in this match yet. It’s possible England bat India out of it
  tomorrow, but if they don’t, and if Tonge and Overton don’t sort themselves,
  they could find themselves in an uncomfortable position batting last. Let’s
  hope so: this series deserves it England will be much the happier side, having
  bowled poorly but returned well. India will have to go some to win from here,
  but the injury to Woakes will help them and if they can add another fifty,
  they’ll feel in the game; another hundred, and they’ve a good chance of doing
  something. 64th over: India 204-6 (Nair 52, Sundar 19) Bethell to complete the
  day, and I’d think about offering the drive if I was him, because the batters
  won’t want to attack; he needs to tempt them into playing a shot. And he does
  too, slanting one across Washington, who pushes at it, misses … and the ball
  just misses off-stump. That was really nicely bowled and it earns him a second
  slip, but the two remaining deliveries are safely negotiated, and it’s a
  maiden to end a fantastic day of Test-match cricket. Are there any other
  kinds? 63rd over: India 204-6 (Nair 52, Sundar 19) Thanks for all the foot
  messages, I now feel like I’m in a Tarantino film; next, i’m going to invent a
  problem with an ear, to experience what it’s like to feature in a Murakami
  novel. And for avoidance of doubt, I don’t have athlete’s foot, I just have
  itch, Otherwise, Atkinson pumps in again, his 19th over of the day going for a
  single to Washington. One to go. “t’s not going to be to everyone’s tastes,
  admits Matt Dony, “but I find it physically impossible to listen to The Voice
  of Trespass by Between The Buried and Me without bouncing. It’s the most
  infectious, groovy, bouncy slice of metal you will ever hear. This party is
  going to have a mosh pit!” Every party needs one. I saw Supergrass recently,
  and had forgotten how much I enjoy jumping mindlessly into strangers 62nd
  over: India 203-6 (Nair 52, Sundar 18) Pope does toss Bethell the ball and he
  opens with a drag-down, Nair turning to deep backward square; they run two,
  and that’s a crucial fifty, for both player and team. Two failures here and he
  probably doesn’t play another Test, but instead he’s scored a quarter of his
  team’s runs and is still at the wicket; well batted, old mate. His celebration
  is muted because he knows the job isn’t close to done, a single to midwicket
  gets him off strike, then Washington returns it with another to deep square.
  Two overs left in the day, I reckon. 61st over: India 199-6 (Nair 49, Sundar
  17) Atkinson returns for a 15-minute burst and, while he charges in, Bethell
  reminds Pope that he can bowl, practising his action ostentatiously. I doubt
  England want to turn to spin, it’s just they’ve only one bowler left not
  spraying it about, and he’s been injured almost all summer. Washington takes
  him for one, then Nair, seeking his fifty, shoves to Tongue at mid-on and sets
  off; this is going to be tight … but Tongue fumbles! What a day he’s had; take
  that cleanly, and the batter was in deep trouble. 60th over: India 197-6 (Nair
  48, Sundar 16) Tongue offers another ball on the hip and Washington doesn’t
  miss out, glancing four to deep square; backing it up is one way wide of
  off-stump. In comms, Broad notes that the England bowlers have been waiting
  all series for conditions like these, only to perform poorly … except the
  scoreboard looks fine. A decentish bouncer follows, but it’s left, a flick to
  square leg adds one, then a dreadful delivery, which perhaps slips out of the
  hand, arrives at hip-height and is duly guided through point for four. 59th
  over: India 188-6 (Nair 44, Sundar 11) A poor delivery from Overton is flicked
  to deep square for one; that could’ve been worse. Washington then tosses head
  back after failing to nail a wide one; one outside leg follows, Overton unable
  to hide his erratic behaviour behind Tongue, who has, at least, taken wickets.
  And his next ball is poor too, too full and driven for three; England are
  really struggling to build pressure and I wonder if we might soon see spin,
  especially given the darkening sky. 58th over: India 184-6 (Nair 43, Sundar 8)
  It looks pretty murky out there now, and I’m not sure we’ll get the full 25
  minutes we’re due. But have a look! Another beauty from Tongue moves away from
  Washington, beating his push, part of a maiden – the bowler’s third of the
  day, oddly enough, his figures of 12-3-38-2 almost as economical as they are
  deadly. “Put it in an empty waste paper bin full of water,” offers John Cox on
  my foot emergency. “I’m sure it’s been said, but what would Sir Jimmy’s
  figures be by now?” Depends if his foot was itching or not. 57th over: India
  184-6 (Nair 43, Sundar 8) A single to point adds one to Washington’s total,
  then we cut to Ollie Pope and I wonder about him as vice-captain. I can’t
  speak for his cricket brain, which perhaps is such as to make him an obvious
  choice. But it’s hard not to wonder if status will keep him in the team at
  some point – perhaps it already has – and maybe Duckett would be a better
  pick. Anyhow, Nair drives towards the cover boundary and Woakes diligently
  sets off and scoops back, saving one … before landing heavily on his shoulder,
  sitting up in quite some pain. You fear that it’s a dislocation and he’s
  quickly helped off, arm in a sling, boyish gooduns grimacing in pain. And the
  even worse news is it might get even worse – if the joint needs putting back,
  I might hear the yowl in north London – and I doubt we see him bowl again this
  Test. Given Overton and Tongue’s struggles, have India been offered a
  reprieve? 56th over: India 179-6 (Nair 40, Sundar 6) The sole of my foot won’t
  stop itching, however much I scratch; anyone got any ideas? Meantime, in less
  important news, Washington edges with soft hands, the ball dropping short of
  slip, then he takes a single and Nair guides two past mid-on. The partnership
  is 26 and if these two can India towards 250, they’ll feel they’re competitive
  if the weather stays the same. 55th over: India 176-6 (Nair 38, Sundar 5)
  Washington turns into the on-side for one then, offered a half-volley on
  middle-and-leg, Nair flicks around the corner for four, exactly what Overton’s
  delivery deserved. His fifth effort, though, is excellent, seaming away and
  beating Nair’s bat; when the line and length are right, it’s not at all easy
  batting on this. “Atherton has just said it’s sometimes more difficult to face
  a bowler spraying it around rather than a bowler landing it on a sixpence who
  you can set yourself against,” writes Phil Sawyer. “Has anyone mentioned Glenn
  McGrath to him?” This sentence is sponsored by the word “sometimes”. 54th
  over: India 170-6 (Nair 33, Sundar 4) Tongue returns, going at Nair from over
  – his two wickets came when he went around to lefties, swinging the ball in
  then moving it away. His first three balls are dots, the fourth too, but well
  wide of the off, then Nair takes a single to mid-on; I think that was the most
  normal over we’ve seen Tongue bowl today. 53rd over: India 169-6 (Nair 32,
  Sundar 4) Nair turns off his hip for a single, and knows that this is a
  crucial knock for him. If he doesn’t score here or in the second innings, he
  might find he’s out of the side for good, but if he does, he should get a run.
  That’s a lot of pressure, but he’s now at the other end; at the striker’s,
  Washington is beaten by one that jags into him, somehow beating bat and
  stumps. “It seems Tongue’s skill is his scattergun approach bringing
  unexpected wickets from the surprise good balls,” asserts Ton van der Gucht,
  “but what is Overton’s role? I get the impression even he was surprised when
  he was selected and I’m not referring to his brother ... I’m hoping he’ll
  prove me wrong and take a hat-trick as I type this, yet I’m doubtful.” I think
  that’s a little harsh – Tongue ran through the India tail twice, while Overton
  has been around the team a long time, which tells us they like him. He has
  pace and bounce, can also bat and field … though ultimately, I agree, I don’t
  think he’s quite good enough to be a consistent factor at this level. 52nd
  over: India 168-6 (Nair 31, Sundar 4) Atkinson has a full over at the new
  batter, but Washington is in nick and when he gets a straight one – that’s a
  no-ball too – he glances to fine leg for four. Those are the only runs from
  the over. 51st over: India 163-6 (Nair 31, Sundar 0) India desperately need
  something significant from this partnership. Umpire’s call on impact and
  missing leg stump. Ollie Pope resumes normal service. 51st over: India 163-6
  (Nair 31, Sundar 0) A square-drive earns Nair two, then Overton offers one on
  the pads and he refuses to miss out, flicking away for four behind square
  before opening the face to fence four more wide of the scrabbling gully. The
  second of those deliveries, though, was much better, full and moving away; we
  then have a break when the batter asks a worker of some sort to move, and she
  tries pressing in a door code knowing there are cameras on her. Anyroad,
  another decent ball bounces and straightens, hitting the pad; there’s an
  appeal, refused, and England review. I’m not surprised, it looked close to me…
  “I just want to observe that at the fall of India’s fifth wicket the scoreline
  read one two three four five,” says Alan Belk. “A totally insignificant but
  cool observation don’t you think?” I do indeed – I noticed myself as I typed
  it, then forgot to announce it. Old age is a miserable thing. 50th over: India
  153-6 (Nair 21, Sundar 0) In comms, Nasser reckons the bounce was made the
  difference there; meanwhile, Sundar lets go three balls not that far from his
  off-peg. I wonder if it’s bantorious out there, and whether anyone’s asked if
  he needs Brook and Duckett brought on. For all the difference it makes! Next
  ball, Jurel looks to cut but doesn’t have room nor does he make it, instead
  tamely edging to two, where Brook takes a really smart catch at
  shoulder-height, moving and turning right . India are in big trouble, the
  series slipping away from them; throughout the series, Gill losing tosses
  hasn’t mattered, but it has today and Atkinson deserves that wicket. Yup, the
  ball was missing the off-bail. This looked like it was missing off-stump to me
  – impact is very close to it, the ball didn’t seem on-line, and may also be
  high. Jurel reviews… 49th over: India 153-5 (Nair 21, Jurel 19) Overton
  replaces Woakes and, offered one short and wide, Jurel doesn’t miss out,
  leaping and stretching to ensure he earns four over the cordon. Tongue’s
  getting all the attention, but Overton has had a diluted version of the same
  day, sending down dross and beauties, just to less intense effect. Oh, and his
  fourth delivery is right there, pitching on off and seaming away, far too good
  for Jurel, who then plays a straight one into the ground for a single. 48th
  over: India 148-5 (Nair 21, Jurel 14) During the last over, we saw Mick Jagger
  in the crowd; I’d be interested to hear what he makes of Tongue’s bowling
  today. In comms, meanwhile, Punter praises Atkinson’s bowling today, noting
  that if he pushes harder off his front foot, he can get even better. Three
  dots are then followed by a three, Nair driving towards cover, then a ball is
  directed into the pads and the bowler likes it, but when umpire says no, the
  England players contemplate a review for as long as it takes for no-ball to be
  signalled. A single then completes the scoring from the over, and that is
  drinks. 47th over: India 143-5 (Nair 18, Jurel 13) Jurel is, as we know, a
  proper batter, and he waits for Woakes’ first delivery, then helps it to the
  fence at deep backward square – India have been offered far too many
  release-balls today. And, after four dots, there’s another, into the pads and
  flicked away for two. 46th over: India 137-5 (Nair 18, Jurel 7) There’s
  something about Atkinson that I can really believe in in which I can really
  believe: I don’t think he’s a special bowler, necessarily, but the confidence,
  certainty and attitude are elevating, and make facing him a constant challenge
  with nowt given for nowt. His latest over yields three singles. 45th over:
  India 134-5 (Nair 17, Jurel 5) I’ve just had to flick on a light and I’m not
  facing 85mph bowling; I wonder if we’ll get to 7.30 with quicks, or if it’ll
  take Root and Bethell to keep us going. As I type, though, the sun comes out
  in the ground and Nair takes a single to midwicket, then one keeps low for
  Woakes and Jurel does pretty well in the end, going back to dig out, before
  adding a single himself. Batting does not look easy, and there’s a
  strangulated appeal when the final delivery of the over hits Nair on the pad,
  but the ball was going down. 44th over: India 132-5 (Nair 16, Jurel 4)
  Atkinson replaces Tongue and refrains from both the sublime and ridiculous,
  sending donw his six maiden of the day. Bo-ring. Re: Simon McMahon’s ice lolly
  preferences, beings David Wall, “I too used to be a big fan of Mini-Milks when
  I was a kid but haven’t been able to have one for almost 30 years since going
  vegetarian. I don’t think i’ll ever get over the deprivation. I mean, why
  would you put gelatine in an ice lolly!” I guess it’s how you get that slight
  but unmistakeable soft stretchiness. They’re a bit bland for me as it goes,
  though how any of them it’s possible to consume is not unredemptive. 43rd
  over: India 132-5 (Nair 16, Jurel 4) Enjoyable malapropism from Broad, he
  praises Woakes’ “prestigious swing” though, in his defence, I guess it is.
  Jurel then turns two to deep square before snaffling a single, but Nair is
  slow to take off and Bethell, having to run around his right hand, dives to
  shy with left … missing, though the batter would’ve made it home in any event.
  An edge for for follows, Woakes pushing one straight knowing the batter
  expected outswing. 42nd over: India 125-5 (Nair 12, Jurel 1) Another amusingly
  dreadful delivery from Tongue, Smith diving to collect – but the umpire still
  signals wide. Now, though, two wickets to the good, the bowler can see the
  funny side, and with 2-33 off eight-and-a-bit, his figures aren’t even bad.
  I’m not sure, though, that his bosses will consider his behaviour acceptable,
  and he needs a fine dive from Bethell at backward point to save three when
  Jurel drives another full toss. “Tongue’s danger for batsmen lies partly in
  his utter unpredictability,” reckons Colum Fordham. “spraying the ball all
  over the place and then, just when the batter feels comfortable, bowls an
  absolute jaffa that surprises the bowler, let alone his started victims
  (Sudharsan and Jadeja).” I agree – though it’s worth noting that Tim Bresnan
  did that too, but without the spraying. 41st over: India 123-5 (Nair 12, Jurel
  0) Woakes is, perhaps, a good partner for Tongue, nagging away in classical
  style while his partner does the opposite – not unlike when, say, Pietersen
  and Bell were batting together. And after three dots he finds a beauty, the
  ball jagging away off the seam, far to good for Nair’s shuffle across, before
  completing his first maiden of the innings. 40th over: India 123-5 (Nair 12,
  Jurel 0) India are in big trouble; Josh Tongue is a punchline (and an REM
  song). Chortle! Cackle! After another disastrous start to an over, Tongue
  again reaches into his toolbox and removes a jaffa therefrom; what’s it even
  doing there?! This delivery is very similar to the one which lozzed
  Sudharasan, swinging in from around, cramping the batter, then straightening,
  fading away a little, demanding the edge, and you can only laugh. 40th over:
  India 123-4 (Nair 12, Jadeja 9) Gosh, Tongue again sends one down leg side, it
  swings late, and Smith is powerless to prevent the ball zipping away for four
  byes; the next delivery is wide of off, so Jadeja unloads the suitcase,
  lashing four more over the slips, terrific shot. 39th over: India 115-4 (Nair
  12, Jadeja 5) Roundhead Pope has had enough of avant-garde line and length,
  restoring Woakes to the attack. He sends down three sots, then Jadeja pushes
  to mid-off, the stand-in skipper fumbles, and they run three. And goodness me,
  more noteworthily than that, it incites the nicest man in the world to
  dispense anger – it’s like Elmo vandalising Hamleys. “I do have a strong
  suspicion/fear they will find a place for Woakes in the team in Australia,”
  emails Laim Crowley. “They seem to like the idea of an elder ‘leader of the
  attack/ which to me has always been more about the quality of the player
  rather than experience, it just happens that Anderson was both the best and
  most experienced for so long. As a Bears fan I should be happy about this, but
  we do this dance with Woaked every year. Half-decent to outstanding English
  summer, then bowl him for little to no result abroad.” I’m sure they’ll want
  him around, but given Stokes, Archer and Wood will be three of the frontline
  bowlers, I’m not sure how they get him in because I reckon they’ll want
  Atkinson. 38th over: India 112-4 (Nair 12, Jadeja 2) Back comes Tongue, he
  overpitches, and Nair turns a full ball into a half-volley, stepping down to
  time four through cover. The response isn’t bad, but then he angles into the
  pads and Nair gives the delivery what it deserves, flicking four to fine leg.
  I know Stokes likes Tongue, but we’ve seen over the last few weeks – consider
  his words with Archer and Dawson, for example – that he also like bowlers he
  can set a field for. 37th over: India 104-4 (Nair 4, Jadeja 1) Jadeja nurdles
  a single into the on-side and an leg bye follows; if England can get rid of
  him, they might just rustle India out this evening. “A Day for Thorpey,”
  begins Andrew Benton. “Did you see Norwich City’s suicide awareness video last
  year, it’s powerful.” I did, but it bears rewatching. At this stage of human
  history, I imagine most of us have either struggled with mental health or know
  people who have; on which point, my email is at the top of this piece. If ever
  you need a friendly ear or a chat, please don’t be shy about getting in touch
  and know you’ll not be the first or second. 36th over: India 100-4 (Nair 4,
  Jadeja 1) Once again, India need Jadeja to save them, and he gets going with a
  shove to point, Sudharasan – who was playing well – left in the hutch,
  contemplating the ultimate futility of existence, our brains and those of
  others governed by a series of chemical reactions over which we have no
  control whatsoever. How else to explain Josh Tongue? Ahahahahaha! This game!
  After a morning wayward nonsense, Tongue resumes where he left off … then
  conjures a jaffa of hilarious proportions, slanting in an outswinger that’s
  full and straight, then spits away as the batter comes forward, stealing his
  outside edge. Ridiculous behaviour. 36th over: India 101-3 (Sudharsan 38, Nair
  4) Tongue, who sprayed all over the show this morning, returns … and beings
  with leg-side filth. So he aims wide of off and Nair stretches not to miss out
  this time, just about poking a toe-end to cover; they run one. 35th over:
  India 100-3 (Sudharsan 38, Nair 3) Overton is not dissimilar to Carse in his
  ability to extract bounce, sometimes surprisingly so; first, he hits Sudharsan
  on the glove, then forces a fend off the hip, then incites an edge … which
  races away for four between third slip and gully. They’re the only runs off
  the over. 34th over: India 96-3 (Sudharsan 34, Nair 3) England have not bowled
  especially well today – the pitch is helpful, so are the overheads, and
  they’ve taken three wickets, one a run out, while giving away 22 extras which
  include 15 wides. Really, only Stokes and Archer have proved themselves as
  reliable, though of course there’s Mark Wood to come back soon – all being
  well – to give the attack a different dimension, perhaps with the old ball as
  much as the new. Atkinson, though, is staking a claim for a place in the side,
  and he sends down another maiden, his fifth; 1-15 off 12 is a pretty
  respectable return on return. “Horace Brearley? Pah” begins Andrew Thomas. “My
  grandparents were Horace and Doris. I was given his middle name and luckily
  that was a rather more reasonable Stephen.” Hoz and Doz, superb. 33rd over:
  India 96-3 (Sudharsan 34, Nair 3) A single to Nair, then Overton incites extra
  bounce and Sudharsan, who might just be cementing himself into the side,
  prances, rising with the ball and cutting hard to third man for four. That was
  very, very good – the eyes and hands necessary to play that shot are not
  available to all. As regards the below, incidentally, this is lovely: 32nd
  over: India 91-3 (Sudharsan 30, Nair 3)With Atkinson coming around, Sudharsan
  opens the face and forces away to deep third for a couple, then a pigeon
  “Speckled Jim, says Ian Ward – flies across his eye-line as the bowler
  releases; he’s so focused he doesn’t appear to notice. This scene reminds me
  of a lovely word the Blackadder lot used to use – “plumpening” – which they
  used to describe the process they went through when they had a gag, then sat
  about together trying to work out its funniest form. 31st over: India 89-3
  (Sudharsan 28, Nair 3) Good loosener from Lil Overton, lifting off a length,
  but behind it is filth, short, wide, and ignored by Nair, who opts not to risk
  getting out by leaving along. He then gets off the mark tucking a leg-stump
  half-volley towards midwicket for two, then the bowler again hits his length –
  there’s plenty in this track – and Nair removes his bat at the last second.
  Decent judgment, that, and he gets his rewards when another poor delivery, too
  straight, allows him to turn around the corner for two more. 30th over: India
  85-3 (Sudharsan 28, Nair 0) Atkinson’s on the money immediately, and the more
  I see of him, the more I’m interested to see if he can insert his bustle,
  confidence and sense of timing into an Ashes contest. After three dots, he
  lands one on the seam, Sudharsan comes forward as the ball scrambles, it hits
  the pad and there’s an appeal, but I think there was an edge and even if not,
  it was going down. Maiden. Our teams are out, it looks a pleasant afternoon,
  and there’s a decent chance we get two-and-three-quarter hours of undisturbed
  cricket. Oh, and now it’s sunny! Atkinson has the ball, and … play. “Listening
  to cricket,” begins Ian Davis. “One of my maths teachers was Horace Brearley,
  father of Mike and the school’s cricket coach. During the Test-Match season,
  it was compulsory someone at the back of the class to be listening to TMS on a
  new-fangled tranny with the sound turned down so that only the owner could
  hear it. Every so often, Horace would stop what he was doing and ask for the
  latest score.” Horace Brearley is a sensational name. We had a similar
  teacher, who also let us bring in cans occasionally; I’m not certain that’d
  pass today. It’s a long evening dig, so I’m going to nip off briefly to get a
  drink; see you in about eight minutes. They’re taking off the last of the big
  covers, but underneath it is the slippery area that took Woakes off his feet
  this morning, so there’s still work to do. The covers are coming off and we
  can, I think, go till 7.30 with a monster evening sesh; the weather might just
  allow it, too “Sometimes the blog comes into its own with the rain breaks,
  eh?” chuckles Oli Haill. “Anyway, if I went to a party and they played Summon
  the Fire by the Comet is Coming, I’d hope I’d be far gone enough to throw off
  my inhibitions and thrash about dancing like a mad. A negligible cricket
  connection: the they might be instructions from Stokes/Baz for the fast
  bowlers.” I’m still thinking what my entry will be – I was hoping someone
  would stick in Still D.R.E. and Sandstorm by Darude, so I didn’t have to.
  “Aston Vanilla? Good God.” returns Shaun T. “Also, thanks to Simon McMahon who
  I think is spot on with his ‘when I was a lad, a Fab, a Zoom or a Mini-Milk
  being the top of the tree back then..’ And I’d also like to add my Mam’s
  favourite – Strawberry Split/Mivi (Mivvi,Mivvy ?) - and although technically
  not a ‘lolly’ as such – ice pops for me. I remember the days when you could
  get about 10 for 50p or something. No better way to cool right down on a
  baking hot day, even if the last two or three would’ve turned to drinks by the
  time you got to them.” I too love a mivvi/mivi/mivvy – the Del Monte
  modern-day offerings are, while not the same, a pretty good rendition of
  similar, and much tangier. As it happens, a mate recently bought some ice pops
  and we were shocked at how much we enjoyed them. They were Mr Freeze, but I’m
  also a big fan of the ice berger. According to Cricinfo, the rain has chilled
  a little and part of the cover has come off. Hopefully we get back on soon.
  “Thank you,” returns Richard O’Hagan – not all all the community is one of the
  many things that makes this thing of ours special. “In honour of Thorpe’s
  Karachi innings, can I suggest OBOing in near-darkness tomorrow.” If anyone
  can get Moin Khan round to shout in my ear, that’d really complete the vibe.
  Back to our match, Andrew Goudie gets in touch to note that “18% of the total
  is wides. That’s under-10s stuff. Woakes will go because he’s a good bloke on
  tour.” Yup, and extras were literally the, or a difference between the sides
  at Lord’s. I think Stokes and Baz are pretty ruthless, and they’ll know Woakes
  almost definitely own’t be a factor in Australia unless the summer is a wet
  one – as it was last time England won there, in 2010-11, though Australia’s
  bowling options – Bollinger, Beeer, Doherty, Harris before he was brilliant,
  Johnson before he was terrifying, Hilfenhaus, Siddle and Watson – also had
  something to do with it. Tangentially, was Johnson’s bowling in Mitch’s Ashes
  the best most of us have seen against England? I don’t think I’ve seen better,
  not even Alderman in 1989 or any of the West Indies demolitions. “My little
  club here in Buckinghamshire, Penn Street CC, are trying to raise £2500 for
  Opening Up Cricket, an organisation supporting mental health awareness within
  the game,” says Richard O’Hagan. “We are holding a 24-hour net session from
  6pm and would welcome any support that the OBO readers can manage, especially
  as this Test has been dedicated to the memory of Graham Thorpe. The Just
  Giving link is worth a look, if only for the chance to marvel at what appears
  to be my disembodied head floating second from the left.” Great stuff, well
  done to all – please do help out if you can. On which point, tomorrow is A Day
  For Thorpey, so Smyth and I have planned to do something special to celebrate
  one of our cricketing heroes – we’ll start by wearing headbands in his honour,
  but please feel free to suggest other ideas. So I guess the hope is that we
  resume at 4.30 or sometime after, and have a long evening session – we can go
  till 7pm. “You devil, you!” chides Andrew Benton. “I have Fruit Pastilles
  lollies often, and double them up with blackcurrant-only ones, plus Smarties
  that I put in the freezer until they are very crunchy and cold – best
  refreshing summer snack ever. Just what England need during a rain break, in
  fact.” In similar vein, Jelly Tots and Skittles are also great out of the
  freezer – as they are in a milkshake. I’m not sure what the players eat during
  breaks, but KP once told me that Lord’s have by far the best lunches, and
  being able to wade in was the consolation if you were out in the morning
  session. “It’s not that I don’t care about this game, or the Ashes,”
  blasphemes Simon McMahon, “but your mention of Fruit Pastilles ice lollies is,
  I think, the real hot topic of the day and can’t pass without comment. My two
  girls, Evie and Anna, loved them, and I suspect still do, though they used to
  get in a right mess when eating them, especially on hot days, so I hope you’ve
  taken all relevant precautions. They didn’t exist when I was a lad, a Fab, a
  Zoom or a Mini-Milk being the top of the tree back then. Thank you for
  reminding me of the joys of childhood, and indeed parenthood.” Zooms remain
  elite and surely the inspiration behind Fruit Pastilles. And both taste even
  better with a bit of post-drop crunch embedded. “Given how much rain there’s
  been in London today,” writes Andy Flintoff, “and the on-off nature of play,
  why didn’t they move it to somewhere where it isn’t raining? Like Manchester
  for instance?” In similar vein, why didn’t they move it to somewhere where it
  isn’t raining? Like north London for instance?” “You can’t beat a solid pure
  orange juice one,” reckons Shaun T of ice lollies, “resisting the temptation
  to take bites when you can have five minutes of licking and savouring
  instead.... even taking in the stick at the bottom as it melts down.... a real
  skill in my book. And is it my imagination or did they (do they still??) used
  to have naff, Christmas-cracker-type jokes on them. I wonder if anyone ever
  remembers a good one they chuckled at ? Anyway, bloody rain...” You’re talking
  to someone to crunches one sweet while unwrapping the next – one of many
  habits which screams ADHD! – but yup, I remember the gags. - What do you get
  if you cross a football team with an ice cream? - Aston Vanilla. They’ve
  covered more than the square, which suggests they expect more than just a
  shower. So here’s the OBO rain playlist to keep you going. But also, might it
  be time for another? How about the OBO party playlist? Send in your best party
  tune, no more than one per person, and I’ll collate. “Found a new way to
  listen to cricket,” exults Tom Bancroft. “Recently got hearing aids, which
  means I can listen to the cricket without anyone knowing. Have bought a
  stretching mat which is very comfy to lie on. So far this ‘stretching session’
  has lasted an hour. Wife is very impressed.” Great stuff – just the other day
  I was reading about headphones you can lie on which, with the Ashes in mind,
  feels like something I need. Although your anecdote also reminds me of the
  1992 World Cup final, which clashed with my end of term second-year maths
  exam. So I stuck an earpiece down the sleeve of my blazer and updated the
  class, none of who cared, via cough-talking. “Fairbrother’s out” still haunts
  me to this day. Can I tell you a secret? I’ve just gone to get myself a Fruit
  Pastilles ice lolly, the absolute mother and father of the genre. Don’t tell
  my parents. It’s heavier than a few minutes ago, and I’m afraid it’s going to
  be this kind of day. Hopefully we’ll get the pitch covered so we can get going
  again as soon as it’s stopped, but for now, we are bereft of cricket – but not
  the talking of nonsense. 29th over: India 85-3 (Sudharsan 28, Nair 0) Two dots
  then two wides, and it’s now raining steadily again; we might get the end of
  this over and another, but if it doesn’t let up, they’ll have to come off.
  Meantime, Overton completes his over with a decent delivery which lifts off a
  length to rattle Nair in the gizzard. “I’ve enjoyed your thoughts on the
  England line-up for the Ashes,” begins Tom van der Gucht, “and I’ve been
  giving some thoughts regarding the next steps for this quixotic and
  entertaining England team. Bringing Bethell in today at least brings some
  excitement with a mercurial talent having a pop at the champ, but I’m also
  keen to see what the future brings with the likes of Ahmed growing as a
  potential all-rounder. I’d like to see him given a bash in the ODI series
  later this summer at number 3 (giving Root a rest) although, I suspect the
  Ashes might arrive too soon for his second coming yet it would be great to see
  him fighting for a berth in the Test squad.” At this point, it feels like
  they’ve invested too much in Bashir to pick another Test spinner ahead of him.
  I’d not be surprised if England don’t bother with a spinner at Brisbane, but
  if they do, it’ll be him or Root/Bethell, I think. Which isn’t to say I’m not
  interested to see more of Ahmed, I am. 28th over: India 83-3 (Sudharsan 28,
  Nair 0) That was really good work from Atkinson and you can see the crowd
  cavorting behind Gill as the horror sets in; sport is evil and wonderful.
  Getting run out is bad enough, getting run out like that is worse, and getting
  run out like that as captain is just absolute worsts. Nair, back in the side
  and under pressure, sees out the wicket maiden; the final delivery nips off
  the seam and though I think he plays inside it, it reminds us that there’s
  plenty of juice in this pitch. A fifth-Test dismissal if ever I saw one. Gill
  defends towards mid-off and decides he wants a run when there isn’t one there
  for him; following through, Atkinson collects and has time to steady before
  taking aim, throwing down the stumps, one bounce, as Gill slips on the turn.
  The India captain will be feeling very, very poorly, his insides leaping out
  through his mouth and nose. 27th over: India 83-2 (Sudharsan 28, Gill 21) Gill
  dabs to the side of gully for one, then Overton narrowly misses Sudharsan’s
  off-stump, following up with one that lifts, kissing the batter’s fingers;
  there’s something in this track, but can the bowlers bowl well enough and
  consistently enough to exploit it? Perhaps so! The final delivery of the over
  beats Sudharsan and Overton thinks he heard an edge – I do too – but no one
  else agrees. 26th over: India 82-2 (Sudharsan 28, Gill 20) Sudharsan takes two
  to cover, then rotates the strike by turning to deep backward square; Atkinson
  then squares Gill up, the ball squirting towards point, and the batter has to
  a send his partner back before trouble ensues. A single and a no-ball, called
  late, follow … then a wild, high wide means an eighth ball – Atkinson is
  staking his claim for Australia – and it’s much better, beating Sudharsan
  outside off. 25th over: India 76-2 (Sudharsan 25, Gill 19) Overton badly needs
  a better spell than he produced this morning and his third ball is decent,
  moving away and leaving Gill rummaging for it; he somehow diverts it to point,
  not to leg, where he’d planned for it to go. Then, after two fgurther dots,
  Gill steps into a picturesque cover-drive that races away for four. “Good
  afternoon from Barcelona! Wishing I could send the sun over, says Risho
  Malhotra. “Honestly, Virat and Rohit’s test returns were diminishing and
  nobody seems to mention this,” s. “I’m missing the days of
  Ishant-Shami-Bumrah. Our last 10 test matches have shown how important they
  were.” I agree – those players won’t necessarily be missed on account of what
  they were no longer delivering, but you can’t fail to notice the absence of
  champions who’ve done it all – from the dressing room, but also in terms of
  the security their presence offers and the knowhow they offer. 24th over:
  India 72-2 (Sudharsan 25, Gill 15) Atkinson was the pick of the bowlers this
  morning, which I guess I find interesting. It felt to me like his summer last
  term was a level or two above his actual level, but you get some players who
  are obviously brilliant and others who, every time they’re challenged, up
  their level; perhaps he’s one of those. Either way, Ben Stokes will have a
  difficult choice to make at the Gaba; Archer will play if fit, but I can’t
  make an honest case for Woakes on Australian pitches, while Tongue, Overton or
  Carse will be in the conversation but not automatic picks. Maiden. Here we go,
  Atkinson with the ball. Back come our teams; hopefully we’re done with rain,
  but there’s more of it on the radar, we’re told. I was lucky enough to be at
  Durham this Test. This streak also has a special place in my heart: a group of
  us decided we’d stay away from the cricket at work to sit down together in the
  viewing and watch the full day. Not bad. On Sky, Athers is reading a narrative
  poem he wrote about Stuart Broad and I think my eyeballs might be sweating:
  the warmth of feeling; someone making the most of themselves and their life;
  and the sense of the passing years, has absolutely done for me. What an
  absolute champion; a champion and a mensch. Thanks Taha and good moderate
  afternoon everyone. It’s raining again, but the hope is that it’s a passing
  shower and we’re still good for a 3pm resumption. And on that note, I’ll pass
  the baton to Daniel Harris. Keep him company with the emails. Thanks for
  joining me! Yep, it was coming. It’s raining again and the covers are coming
  back on. The revised timings for today are in: Afternoon session: 3pm-5.05pm
  Evening session: 5.25pm-7pm, with an extra half-hour for overs not bowled.
  Arunachalam Vaidyanathan writes: As an Indian fan I have to say I’m very
  frustrated with the team selection. India under kohli when they were at their
  best was when they picked teams with the goal of taking 20 wickets and trusted
  the front line batsmen, nowadays the team selection seems to be more defensive
  . Also as an aside what happened to Matthew potts, I remember being impressed
  by him An excellent point on Potts, who not only has a very handy Test CV – 36
  wickets at 29.44 – but also a very decent fitness record over the last few
  years. He’d do a very handy job in these conditions. We’ll be back then …
  though the Met Office forecast suggests we’re on for more trouble. A first
  sight of Oasis merch at this Test, with someone in the stands rocking the new
  Adidas collaboration top. What a double-header that is: Wembley last night,
  the Oval today. Here’s a tenuous connection between cricket and the band.
  Sotheby’s has announced that a 1996 painting of the brothers by Elizabeth
  Peyton is to be part of its June contemporary art auction in London. It was
  based on a photograph of the brothers taken by Stefan De Batselier in 1995,
  the year Noel is said to have hit his brother with a cricket bat. Another
  inspection at 2.30pm BST says Sky. Keep those emails coming in while we wait.
  Peter Salmon writes in: Haven’t hear much chat about the fact that Shubman
  Gill started this match needing a mere 253 runs to go past Bradman for most
  runs ever in a series. He’s gone past Sobers, Faulkner, Gower, Gavaskar and
  Sutcliffe already today in 15 runs and even 100 in this match would put him
  into eighth. Might be fun if he needs a few runs in the last session of day 5
  to go past The Don, and Pope tries to shake hands for a draw... Still a long
  way to go, but definitely one to keep an eye on. He did look in excellent nick
  this morning, enjoying some loose deliveries from Jamie Overton. Tom Wilson
  writes in after digging deep on Statsguru: Root and Ponting do have quite
  similar records but with one key difference - the one country Root has
  struggled in is Australia (average 35.68), whilst Ponting’s struggles came in
  India (average 26.48). Otherwise both have 40++ averages all over (taking out
  Root’s two tests in Bangladesh, and Ponting’s one test in Zimbabwe).
  Fortunately for Root, there’s a big opportunity to rectify that anomaly coming
  next... It’s funny to me how we talk about Root in Australia (this is not a
  critique of Tom’s point). Yes, a century would be good, quite important to
  elevate him in the discussion of greats, but he’s never been dreadful there.
  He averaged 47.25 in the 17/18 series; 17 more runs in the first innings at
  Sydney and how different the conversation would be. Felix Wood writes in: Is
  this Woakes’ last hurrah? He’s been fairly ineffective this summer, certainly
  not deserving of the new ball in my opinion, and he’d be a liability in
  Australia. I don’t agree with his being unlucky - if you beat the bat that
  many times without taking an edge then it’s more likely that your length is
  slightly off. I don’t see England getting anywhere near 20 wickets this test,
  could we really not have wheeled Jimmy out for a surprise one of come-back?
  He’d have had India five down by now in these conditions. He’s certainly in a
  difficult spot. It’s been a tough summer for every bowler so his numbers have
  to be placed in that context. As for Australia, he’s never had a great time
  abroad … but England have shown a desire to have one steady, controlling hand
  in their attack, with Woakes trusted in that role over the last year, even in
  Pakistan and New Zealand. In other words, I don’t know. We’ve got an
  inspection at 2pm BST. The covers are making their way off. If you really need
  immediate action, Tanya Aldred’s helming the county blog. The rain has
  relented, time for the major clean-up job. Stephen Brown emailed in earlier:
  Really looking forward to this test and actually a bit annoyed with myself for
  not getting tickets. This idea is probably a week late, but I can’t get over
  how similar Root and Ponting’s stats are. Root has edged 29 runs ahead, but
  they have batter in basically the same number of innings, faced an incredibly
  similar number of balls (Root has faced 2.5% more), high scores within 5 of
  each other, and averages and strike rates that aren’t far apart. The biggest
  difference probably comes from the smallest number which is that Root has only
  hit 45 sixes, to Ponting’s 73. I can’t help feeling like there is a lesson in
  there to the likes of Duckett etc. in the way the game should be played if you
  want to be an all time great by the time you retire. I think it’s 31 runs
  ahead (sorry to be that guy) but your point still stands: very similar
  records. I wouldn’t ask Duckett to change his game, though – he’s doing a
  brilliant job at the top order. It’s properly thundering down at the Oval. I
  reckon we’re on for a pretty significant delay. 23rd over: India 72-2
  (Sudharsan 25, Gill 15) Gill has looked untroubled so far, while Overton
  closes his over with hands on hips, still not happy with how he’s landing at
  the crease. And then, out of nowhere, it starts pouring! Time for a break and
  early lunch. 22nd over: India 68-2 (Sudharsan 25, Gill 11) Sudharsan has done
  a lot of hard work and he advances into the twenties with a lovely straight
  drive off Woakes for four. He’s slowly easing himself in. 21st over: India
  62-2 (Surdharsan 19, Gill 11) Gill pulls imperiously for one and makes hay
  with the final ball, cutting a poor delivery from Overton for four. 20th over:
  India 56-2 (Sudharsan 18, Gill 6) The floodlights are finally off, the sun
  properly beaming down. Sudharsan continues to play inside the line against
  Woakes, the ball whistling past his outside edge. The release of pressure
  comes with one on the pads, Sudharsan glancing to the fine-leg rope for four.
  19th over: India 52-2 (Sudharsan 14, Gill 6) Jamie Overton, three years on
  from his Test debut, is back, bowling on his home ground. Replacing Tongue,
  he’s erratic, too; a wide outside off is followed by a long hop, Gill cutting
  comfortably for four. The sun is out now at the Oval yet the lights are still
  on. Overton is clearly not happy with how he’s landing at the crease as he
  drops short to Gill, Pope doing well at midwicket to stop the boundary. A
  beaut closes the over, Overton getting an outswinger to beat Gill’s bat. 18th
  over: India 46-2 (Sudharsan 13, Gill 2) Gill clips Woakes off his pads, nearly
  bringing Jacob Bethell into play at midwicket … it drops just short, claimed
  on the half-volley. 17th over: India 44-2 (Sudharsan 13, Gill 0) Lovely from
  Sudharsan – who knows this ground well as an overseas pro with Surrey –
  on-driving Tongue for four. 16th over: India 40-2 (Sudharsan 9, Gill 0) The
  sun has poked through at the Oval, but it’s not easy out there for the two
  batters. Woakes gets some serious nip away from Sudharsan before Shubman Gill
  leaves his first delivery of the day. That’s big. Rahul was the more
  comfortable one at the crease but he brings out the wrong shot against Woakes,
  cutting when he needed to show the straight bat, inside-edging on to his
  stumps. 15th over: India 38-1 (Sudharsan 8, Rahul 14) Tongue continues from
  the Vauxhall End, Pope backing him with a packed slip cordon. He gets the ball
  to leap off a length and Sudharsan does pretty well to keep the ball down and
  safe. An attempted cut goes wrong with the next delivery as Sudharsan plays
  out five dots, stuck on eight off 43 deliveries. 14th over: India 37-1
  (Sudharsan 8, Rahul 14) Woakes is back to have a go from the Pavilion End,
  with Sudharsan still trying to settle in. Rahul is completely locked in and
  fairly untroubled as he claims the only run of the over. John Donnellan, I’ve
  got you sorted: Hi everybody from an overcast Spiddal in county Galway. It’s
  our last day at work before our summer holidays and we’re all winding down. I
  can’t speak for any of my colleagues but I’m in bad need of some live
  commentary to get me through to 5pm. Anyone out there with a link to the
  overseas TMS. Here you go. Vikram Prasad asks: Apologies if I got this wrong
  (its still before my 2nd cup of coffee early in Michigan), but does this mark
  the 16th time in a row India has lost the toss? That has ~1 in 32000 odds
  assuming a truly unbiased coin and the usual caveats about randomness.....
  It’s not that bad. It’s just their 15th failed coin toss in a row. 13th over:
  India 36-1 (Sudharsan 8, Rahul 13) A snorter from Tongue! He’s got this
  delivery in him, a yorker that floors Sudharsan … actually, upon replay, it’s
  a low full toss that the left-hander inside-edges on to his pads. It prompted
  a full-blooded leg-before shout, though. Tongue goes too wide of off stump
  later in the over, and Sudharsan punches down the ground for two to close it.
  Time for drinks, with Tongue still trying to find his radar. 12th over: India
  34-1 (Sudharsan 6, Rahul 13) Pope is backing his Surrey teammate to strike
  again in this spell; Atkinson thunders in for his sixth over. He gets the ball
  to nip away from Rahul, a gorgeous delivery, and closes another tight set. He
  has figures of one for seven. 11th over: India 33-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 13)
  Tongue has got the wides out of his system and closes a maiden with a testing
  nip-backer to Rahul. It’s a quality leave from the right-hander. 10th over:
  India 33-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 13) The lights are on at the Oval as Atkinson
  continues, immaculate with his line to Sudharsan, getting the ball to zigzag.
  Smith produces an excellent diving take to close the over. 9th over: India
  30-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 10) Ollie Pope makes his first change of the morning,
  with Josh Tongue replacing Woakes. His first delivery is way off, a wide down
  the leg side that runs to the boundary. Rahul masterfully gets off strike,
  dabbing into the ground to nick a single. Tongue goes around the wicket to
  Sudharsan and hoops one down the leg side before producing another wide, this
  time outside off stump. He seems to be struggling with his landing at the
  crease, and out comes another ball that runs away for five wides down leg.
  This is a wild start but he eventually finds his spot, closing with a fine
  ball past the outside edge. 8th over: India 18-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 9) The
  action is coming from Atkinson’s end, the quick steaming in with the pavilion
  behind him. There’s decent carry on the way to Jamie Smith, and no messing
  about with his line. It’s another fine over, with just one off it. 7th over:
  India 17-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 8) Four slips and a gully wait for Sudharsan to
  err. Woakes, from over the wicket, unfurls a beauty, nipping the ball away
  from the left-hander. He’s surely been waiting all series for these
  conditions. Sudharsan then receives a gift, though, on the pads and clipped
  past leg slip for four. 6th over: India 13-1 (Sudharsan 1, Rahul 8) Atkinson
  is fresh, clocking in the mid-80s as he tries to nip the ball away from Rahul.
  He hangs it around fifth stump and Rahul is forced to get out the leave. A
  maiden. 5th over: India 13-1 (Sudharsan 1, Rahul 8) Sudharsan gets going with
  a dab into the offside for one before Woakes, still searching for the right
  areas, ends with a tempter wide of off stump. 4th over: India 10-1 (Sudharsan
  0, Rahul 7) Atkinson has rhythm as he beats the bat of Sai Sudharsan, the No 3
  still trying to lock down his position. Atkinson launches into an lbw appeal
  after going full to Jaiswal from around the wicket … England review. Here
  comes DRS: there’s no bat on it, and it looks pretty plumb … gone, smashing
  into leg stump! Atkinson is back, that wobble/scramble seam (I’m not too sure,
  but that’s the point), causing havoc. 3rd over: India 9-0 (Jaiswal 2, Rahul 7)
  Rahul has his first boundary, clipping to the midwicket rope, Jamie Overton’s
  dive and slide unable to stop it. Woakes hasn’t go the ball hooping yet, as
  Jaiswal inside-edges for one to stay on strike for the next over. 2nd over:
  India 3-0 (Jaiswal 1, Rahul 2) In sprints Gus Atkinson, on his home ground,
  for his first bit of action in this series. He gets the wobble seam to nip
  past Jaiswal’s off stump, a Rahul single the only damage from the over. 1st
  over: India 2-0 (Jaiswal 1, Rahul 1) We’re up and away with Chris Woakes –
  soldiering on for all five Tests – running in. Yashasvi Jaiswal tucks him away
  for one off the second ball of the over, and Rahul, brilliant all series, is
  up and way immediately. Woakes beats Jaiswal’s outside edge with the final
  ball to get the crowd going. Rohan Tewari is concerned, too: Looking forward
  to a morning where the contest between bat and ball is (hopefully!) more even
  than what we have seen all summer. I can’t get behind India’s team selection
  here though. If they want to square the series 2-2, the burden is on them to
  take 20 wickets. With only 3 strike bowlers (one of them being a dodgy 3rd
  seamer) I’m not sure I see India’s route to victory and a possible repeat of
  Headingley. Such a shame that we haven’t seen Kuldeep. He doesn’t need the
  pitch to be suitable: he’s got the revs and flight to cause trouble anywhere.
  The covers were on for a bit, but they’re off now. We should be starting at
  11. Krishnamoorthy v writes: The omission of Kuldeep yadav is baffling. The
  current bowling line up of 5 bowlers out of which two are all rounders does
  not make sense. Scoring 700 will not ensure victory if you do not have the
  capability to take 20 wickets. England realized it at OT. By the way, has
  there ever been a player who toured and went back without playing a test in a
  5-test series? Kuldeep isn’t alone, of course. Arshdeep Singh hasn’t played
  for India this series either. Patrick Fullick writes: The weather this morning
  reflects my general feeling about this match. I’ve really enjoyed the series
  so far, but the atmosphere today - coming hard on the heels of the OT test -
  feels like the pitches so far: very flat. Here’s hoping for a good game for
  England to win the series. Will be following the match here and on TMS. I’m
  banking on some wickets this morning to cheer you up, Patrick. There is no
  Jasprit Bumrah, as expected. India have been confused about their team all
  summer and they look it again. Karun Nair, dropped at Old Trafford, is back
  in. He’s one of four changes; once again, there is no Kuldeep Yadav. England:
  Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope (c), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jacob
  Bethell, Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, Josh
  Tongue India: Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c),
  Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Washington Sundar, Akash Deep,
  Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj Ollie Pope wins it and England will bowl
  first. It’s green, it’s overcast, it’s pretty much a no-brainer. Matt Dony
  writes in: Your preamble makes it sound a bit like Stokes has been replaced by
  3 players. Which makes complete sense, as it often feels like he’s worth at
  least three ‘normal’ cricketers. Ben Stokes the inspirational captain, Ben
  Stokes the outrageously gifted cricketer, Ben Stokes the maelstrom of
  personality and will-to-win. I don’t think I’ve ever seen another sportsperson
  who just makes things happen around him like Stokes does. He’s astonishing. It
  is a proper conundrum trying to replace him. They’ve brought in Jacob Bethell
  at six but, on this surface, that requires someone to make up Stokes’ overs as
  a quick. You’re basically calling up two people to replace him. Time to get
  stuck in to some preview material: Stuart Broad is having a look at the green
  pitch and says “it’s a definite win-the-toss-and-bowl”. Ben Stokes has been
  having a chat with Sky. He talks about his braced front leg helping him bowl
  the way he’s done this summer, and is asked about the spiciness of this
  series: “Honestly, I think it gets over-egged sometimes, massively. It’s
  something as players that we don’t lose sleep over. If there’s a bit of niggle
  out there, it’s part of the game.” Hello, hello, hello and welcome to a damp
  Oval. We’ve had the handshakes that didn’t happen and the pitch palaver, but
  we’ve also got this: a fifth Test, with the series yet to be decided. I’ll
  embrace that, as should you. I’m staring at a greenish surface, one the Indian
  players are getting a pretty decent look at; I’m intrigued to see how a
  refreshed, rather experimental England attack goes on it. A reminder, there’s
  no Ben Stokes, with Josh Tongue, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton all shipped
  in. There’s plenty to talk about even before the action starts. Drop me a
  line, and let’s enjoy the last proper show of the summer.

Righto, that’s us done for today. Ali Martin’s report will be in here and on-site shortly, so do check back for that, but otherwise, thanks all for your company and comments, sorry I couldn’t use them all, and see you tomorrow, headbands donned, for Thorpey Day. On which point, we’ll get into it again then, but as below, if anyone needs an ear a chat or a mate, you know my email. Peace out, people. It might not seem this way, but there’s loads of mileage left in this match yet. It’s possible England bat India out of it tomorrow, but if they don’t, and if Tonge and Overton don’t sort themselves, they could find themselves in an uncomfortable position batting last. Let’s hope so: this series deserves it England will be much the happier side, having bowled poorly but returned well. India will have to go some to win from here, but the injury to Woakes will help them and if they can add another fifty, they’ll feel in the game; another hundred, and they’ve a good chance of doing something. 64th over: India 204-6 (Nair 52, Sundar 19) Bethell to complete the day, and I’d think about offering the drive if I was him, because the batters won’t want to attack; he needs to tempt them into playing a shot. And he does too, slanting one across Washington, who pushes at it, misses … and the ball just misses off-stump. That was really nicely bowled and it earns him a second slip, but the two remaining deliveries are safely negotiated, and it’s a maiden to end a fantastic day of Test-match cricket. Are there any other kinds? 63rd over: India 204-6 (Nair 52, Sundar 19) Thanks for all the foot messages, I now feel like I’m in a Tarantino film; next, i’m going to invent a problem with an ear, to experience what it’s like to feature in a Murakami novel. And for avoidance of doubt, I don’t have athlete’s foot, I just have itch, Otherwise, Atkinson pumps in again, his 19th over of the day going for a single to Washington. One to go. “t’s not going to be to everyone’s tastes, admits Matt Dony, “but I find it physically impossible to listen to The Voice of Trespass by Between The Buried and Me without bouncing. It’s the most infectious, groovy, bouncy slice of metal you will ever hear. This party is going to have a mosh pit!” Every party needs one. I saw Supergrass recently, and had forgotten how much I enjoy jumping mindlessly into strangers 62nd over: India 203-6 (Nair 52, Sundar 18) Pope does toss Bethell the ball and he opens with a drag-down, Nair turning to deep backward square; they run two, and that’s a crucial fifty, for both player and team. Two failures here and he probably doesn’t play another Test, but instead he’s scored a quarter of his team’s runs and is still at the wicket; well batted, old mate. His celebration is muted because he knows the job isn’t close to done, a single to midwicket gets him off strike, then Washington returns it with another to deep square. Two overs left in the day, I reckon. 61st over: India 199-6 (Nair 49, Sundar 17) Atkinson returns for a 15-minute burst and, while he charges in, Bethell reminds Pope that he can bowl, practising his action ostentatiously. I doubt England want to turn to spin, it’s just they’ve only one bowler left not spraying it about, and he’s been injured almost all summer. Washington takes him for one, then Nair, seeking his fifty, shoves to Tongue at mid-on and sets off; this is going to be tight … but Tongue fumbles! What a day he’s had; take that cleanly, and the batter was in deep trouble. 60th over: India 197-6 (Nair 48, Sundar 16) Tongue offers another ball on the hip and Washington doesn’t miss out, glancing four to deep square; backing it up is one way wide of off-stump. In comms, Broad notes that the England bowlers have been waiting all series for conditions like these, only to perform poorly … except the scoreboard looks fine. A decentish bouncer follows, but it’s left, a flick to square leg adds one, then a dreadful delivery, which perhaps slips out of the hand, arrives at hip-height and is duly guided through point for four. 59th over: India 188-6 (Nair 44, Sundar 11) A poor delivery from Overton is flicked to deep square for one; that could’ve been worse. Washington then tosses head back after failing to nail a wide one; one outside leg follows, Overton unable to hide his erratic behaviour behind Tongue, who has, at least, taken wickets. And his next ball is poor too, too full and driven for three; England are really struggling to build pressure and I wonder if we might soon see spin, especially given the darkening sky. 58th over: India 184-6 (Nair 43, Sundar 8) It looks pretty murky out there now, and I’m not sure we’ll get the full 25 minutes we’re due. But have a look! Another beauty from Tongue moves away from Washington, beating his push, part of a maiden – the bowler’s third of the day, oddly enough, his figures of 12-3-38-2 almost as economical as they are deadly. “Put it in an empty waste paper bin full of water,” offers John Cox on my foot emergency. “I’m sure it’s been said, but what would Sir Jimmy’s figures be by now?” Depends if his foot was itching or not. 57th over: India 184-6 (Nair 43, Sundar 8) A single to point adds one to Washington’s total, then we cut to Ollie Pope and I wonder about him as vice-captain. I can’t speak for his cricket brain, which perhaps is such as to make him an obvious choice. But it’s hard not to wonder if status will keep him in the team at some point – perhaps it already has – and maybe Duckett would be a better pick. Anyhow, Nair drives towards the cover boundary and Woakes diligently sets off and scoops back, saving one … before landing heavily on his shoulder, sitting up in quite some pain. You fear that it’s a dislocation and he’s quickly helped off, arm in a sling, boyish gooduns grimacing in pain. And the even worse news is it might get even worse – if the joint needs putting back, I might hear the yowl in north London – and I doubt we see him bowl again this Test. Given Overton and Tongue’s struggles, have India been offered a reprieve? 56th over: India 179-6 (Nair 40, Sundar 6) The sole of my foot won’t stop itching, however much I scratch; anyone got any ideas? Meantime, in less important news, Washington edges with soft hands, the ball dropping short of slip, then he takes a single and Nair guides two past mid-on. The partnership is 26 and if these two can India towards 250, they’ll feel they’re competitive if the weather stays the same. 55th over: India 176-6 (Nair 38, Sundar 5) Washington turns into the on-side for one then, offered a half-volley on middle-and-leg, Nair flicks around the corner for four, exactly what Overton’s delivery deserved. His fifth effort, though, is excellent, seaming away and beating Nair’s bat; when the line and length are right, it’s not at all easy batting on this. “Atherton has just said it’s sometimes more difficult to face a bowler spraying it around rather than a bowler landing it on a sixpence who you can set yourself against,” writes Phil Sawyer. “Has anyone mentioned Glenn McGrath to him?” This sentence is sponsored by the word “sometimes”. 54th over: India 170-6 (Nair 33, Sundar 4) Tongue returns, going at Nair from over – his two wickets came when he went around to lefties, swinging the ball in then moving it away. His first three balls are dots, the fourth too, but well wide of the off, then Nair takes a single to mid-on; I think that was the most normal over we’ve seen Tongue bowl today. 53rd over: India 169-6 (Nair 32, Sundar 4) Nair turns off his hip for a single, and knows that this is a crucial knock for him. If he doesn’t score here or in the second innings, he might find he’s out of the side for good, but if he does, he should get a run. That’s a lot of pressure, but he’s now at the other end; at the striker’s, Washington is beaten by one that jags into him, somehow beating bat and stumps. “It seems Tongue’s skill is his scattergun approach bringing unexpected wickets from the surprise good balls,” asserts Ton van der Gucht, “but what is Overton’s role? I get the impression even he was surprised when he was selected and I’m not referring to his brother ... I’m hoping he’ll prove me wrong and take a hat-trick as I type this, yet I’m doubtful.” I think that’s a little harsh – Tongue ran through the India tail twice, while Overton has been around the team a long time, which tells us they like him. He has pace and bounce, can also bat and field … though ultimately, I agree, I don’t think he’s quite good enough to be a consistent factor at this level. 52nd over: India 168-6 (Nair 31, Sundar 4) Atkinson has a full over at the new batter, but Washington is in nick and when he gets a straight one – that’s a no-ball too – he glances to fine leg for four. Those are the only runs from the over. 51st over: India 163-6 (Nair 31, Sundar 0) India desperately need something significant from this partnership. Umpire’s call on impact and missing leg stump. Ollie Pope resumes normal service. 51st over: India 163-6 (Nair 31, Sundar 0) A square-drive earns Nair two, then Overton offers one on the pads and he refuses to miss out, flicking away for four behind square before opening the face to fence four more wide of the scrabbling gully. The second of those deliveries, though, was much better, full and moving away; we then have a break when the batter asks a worker of some sort to move, and she tries pressing in a door code knowing there are cameras on her. Anyroad, another decent ball bounces and straightens, hitting the pad; there’s an appeal, refused, and England review. I’m not surprised, it looked close to me… “I just want to observe that at the fall of India’s fifth wicket the scoreline read one two three four five,” says Alan Belk. “A totally insignificant but cool observation don’t you think?” I do indeed – I noticed myself as I typed it, then forgot to announce it. Old age is a miserable thing. 50th over: India 153-6 (Nair 21, Sundar 0) In comms, Nasser reckons the bounce was made the difference there; meanwhile, Sundar lets go three balls not that far from his off-peg. I wonder if it’s bantorious out there, and whether anyone’s asked if he needs Brook and Duckett brought on. For all the difference it makes! Next ball, Jurel looks to cut but doesn’t have room nor does he make it, instead tamely edging to two, where Brook takes a really smart catch at shoulder-height, moving and turning right . India are in big trouble, the series slipping away from them; throughout the series, Gill losing tosses hasn’t mattered, but it has today and Atkinson deserves that wicket. Yup, the ball was missing the off-bail. This looked like it was missing off-stump to me – impact is very close to it, the ball didn’t seem on-line, and may also be high. Jurel reviews… 49th over: India 153-5 (Nair 21, Jurel 19) Overton replaces Woakes and, offered one short and wide, Jurel doesn’t miss out, leaping and stretching to ensure he earns four over the cordon. Tongue’s getting all the attention, but Overton has had a diluted version of the same day, sending down dross and beauties, just to less intense effect. Oh, and his fourth delivery is right there, pitching on off and seaming away, far too good for Jurel, who then plays a straight one into the ground for a single. 48th over: India 148-5 (Nair 21, Jurel 14) During the last over, we saw Mick Jagger in the crowd; I’d be interested to hear what he makes of Tongue’s bowling today. In comms, meanwhile, Punter praises Atkinson’s bowling today, noting that if he pushes harder off his front foot, he can get even better. Three dots are then followed by a three, Nair driving towards cover, then a ball is directed into the pads and the bowler likes it, but when umpire says no, the England players contemplate a review for as long as it takes for no-ball to be signalled. A single then completes the scoring from the over, and that is drinks. 47th over: India 143-5 (Nair 18, Jurel 13) Jurel is, as we know, a proper batter, and he waits for Woakes’ first delivery, then helps it to the fence at deep backward square – India have been offered far too many release-balls today. And, after four dots, there’s another, into the pads and flicked away for two. 46th over: India 137-5 (Nair 18, Jurel 7) There’s something about Atkinson that I can really believe in in which I can really believe: I don’t think he’s a special bowler, necessarily, but the confidence, certainty and attitude are elevating, and make facing him a constant challenge with nowt given for nowt. His latest over yields three singles. 45th over: India 134-5 (Nair 17, Jurel 5) I’ve just had to flick on a light and I’m not facing 85mph bowling; I wonder if we’ll get to 7.30 with quicks, or if it’ll take Root and Bethell to keep us going. As I type, though, the sun comes out in the ground and Nair takes a single to midwicket, then one keeps low for Woakes and Jurel does pretty well in the end, going back to dig out, before adding a single himself. Batting does not look easy, and there’s a strangulated appeal when the final delivery of the over hits Nair on the pad, but the ball was going down. 44th over: India 132-5 (Nair 16, Jurel 4) Atkinson replaces Tongue and refrains from both the sublime and ridiculous, sending donw his six maiden of the day. Bo-ring. Re: Simon McMahon’s ice lolly preferences, beings David Wall, “I too used to be a big fan of Mini-Milks when I was a kid but haven’t been able to have one for almost 30 years since going vegetarian. I don’t think i’ll ever get over the deprivation. I mean, why would you put gelatine in an ice lolly!” I guess it’s how you get that slight but unmistakeable soft stretchiness. They’re a bit bland for me as it goes, though how any of them it’s possible to consume is not unredemptive. 43rd over: India 132-5 (Nair 16, Jurel 4) Enjoyable malapropism from Broad, he praises Woakes’ “prestigious swing” though, in his defence, I guess it is. Jurel then turns two to deep square before snaffling a single, but Nair is slow to take off and Bethell, having to run around his right hand, dives to shy with left … missing, though the batter would’ve made it home in any event. An edge for for follows, Woakes pushing one straight knowing the batter expected outswing. 42nd over: India 125-5 (Nair 12, Jurel 1) Another amusingly dreadful delivery from Tongue, Smith diving to collect – but the umpire still signals wide. Now, though, two wickets to the good, the bowler can see the funny side, and with 2-33 off eight-and-a-bit, his figures aren’t even bad. I’m not sure, though, that his bosses will consider his behaviour acceptable, and he needs a fine dive from Bethell at backward point to save three when Jurel drives another full toss. “Tongue’s danger for batsmen lies partly in his utter unpredictability,” reckons Colum Fordham. “spraying the ball all over the place and then, just when the batter feels comfortable, bowls an absolute jaffa that surprises the bowler, let alone his started victims (Sudharsan and Jadeja).” I agree – though it’s worth noting that Tim Bresnan did that too, but without the spraying. 41st over: India 123-5 (Nair 12, Jurel 0) Woakes is, perhaps, a good partner for Tongue, nagging away in classical style while his partner does the opposite – not unlike when, say, Pietersen and Bell were batting together. And after three dots he finds a beauty, the ball jagging away off the seam, far to good for Nair’s shuffle across, before completing his first maiden of the innings. 40th over: India 123-5 (Nair 12, Jurel 0) India are in big trouble; Josh Tongue is a punchline (and an REM song). Chortle! Cackle! After another disastrous start to an over, Tongue again reaches into his toolbox and removes a jaffa therefrom; what’s it even doing there?! This delivery is very similar to the one which lozzed Sudharasan, swinging in from around, cramping the batter, then straightening, fading away a little, demanding the edge, and you can only laugh. 40th over: India 123-4 (Nair 12, Jadeja 9) Gosh, Tongue again sends one down leg side, it swings late, and Smith is powerless to prevent the ball zipping away for four byes; the next delivery is wide of off, so Jadeja unloads the suitcase, lashing four more over the slips, terrific shot. 39th over: India 115-4 (Nair 12, Jadeja 5) Roundhead Pope has had enough of avant-garde line and length, restoring Woakes to the attack. He sends down three sots, then Jadeja pushes to mid-off, the stand-in skipper fumbles, and they run three. And goodness me, more noteworthily than that, it incites the nicest man in the world to dispense anger – it’s like Elmo vandalising Hamleys. “I do have a strong suspicion/fear they will find a place for Woakes in the team in Australia,” emails Laim Crowley. “They seem to like the idea of an elder ‘leader of the attack/ which to me has always been more about the quality of the player rather than experience, it just happens that Anderson was both the best and most experienced for so long. As a Bears fan I should be happy about this, but we do this dance with Woaked every year. Half-decent to outstanding English summer, then bowl him for little to no result abroad.” I’m sure they’ll want him around, but given Stokes, Archer and Wood will be three of the frontline bowlers, I’m not sure how they get him in because I reckon they’ll want Atkinson. 38th over: India 112-4 (Nair 12, Jadeja 2) Back comes Tongue, he overpitches, and Nair turns a full ball into a half-volley, stepping down to time four through cover. The response isn’t bad, but then he angles into the pads and Nair gives the delivery what it deserves, flicking four to fine leg. I know Stokes likes Tongue, but we’ve seen over the last few weeks – consider his words with Archer and Dawson, for example – that he also like bowlers he can set a field for. 37th over: India 104-4 (Nair 4, Jadeja 1) Jadeja nurdles a single into the on-side and an leg bye follows; if England can get rid of him, they might just rustle India out this evening. “A Day for Thorpey,” begins Andrew Benton. “Did you see Norwich City’s suicide awareness video last year, it’s powerful.” I did, but it bears rewatching. At this stage of human history, I imagine most of us have either struggled with mental health or know people who have; on which point, my email is at the top of this piece. If ever you need a friendly ear or a chat, please don’t be shy about getting in touch and know you’ll not be the first or second. 36th over: India 100-4 (Nair 4, Jadeja 1) Once again, India need Jadeja to save them, and he gets going with a shove to point, Sudharasan – who was playing well – left in the hutch, contemplating the ultimate futility of existence, our brains and those of others governed by a series of chemical reactions over which we have no control whatsoever. How else to explain Josh Tongue? Ahahahahaha! This game! After a morning wayward nonsense, Tongue resumes where he left off … then conjures a jaffa of hilarious proportions, slanting in an outswinger that’s full and straight, then spits away as the batter comes forward, stealing his outside edge. Ridiculous behaviour. 36th over: India 101-3 (Sudharsan 38, Nair 4) Tongue, who sprayed all over the show this morning, returns … and beings with leg-side filth. So he aims wide of off and Nair stretches not to miss out this time, just about poking a toe-end to cover; they run one. 35th over: India 100-3 (Sudharsan 38, Nair 3) Overton is not dissimilar to Carse in his ability to extract bounce, sometimes surprisingly so; first, he hits Sudharsan on the glove, then forces a fend off the hip, then incites an edge … which races away for four between third slip and gully. They’re the only runs off the over. 34th over: India 96-3 (Sudharsan 34, Nair 3) England have not bowled especially well today – the pitch is helpful, so are the overheads, and they’ve taken three wickets, one a run out, while giving away 22 extras which include 15 wides. Really, only Stokes and Archer have proved themselves as reliable, though of course there’s Mark Wood to come back soon – all being well – to give the attack a different dimension, perhaps with the old ball as much as the new. Atkinson, though, is staking a claim for a place in the side, and he sends down another maiden, his fifth; 1-15 off 12 is a pretty respectable return on return. “Horace Brearley? Pah” begins Andrew Thomas. “My grandparents were Horace and Doris. I was given his middle name and luckily that was a rather more reasonable Stephen.” Hoz and Doz, superb. 33rd over: India 96-3 (Sudharsan 34, Nair 3) A single to Nair, then Overton incites extra bounce and Sudharsan, who might just be cementing himself into the side, prances, rising with the ball and cutting hard to third man for four. That was very, very good – the eyes and hands necessary to play that shot are not available to all. As regards the below, incidentally, this is lovely: 32nd over: India 91-3 (Sudharsan 30, Nair 3)With Atkinson coming around, Sudharsan opens the face and forces away to deep third for a couple, then a pigeon “Speckled Jim, says Ian Ward – flies across his eye-line as the bowler releases; he’s so focused he doesn’t appear to notice. This scene reminds me of a lovely word the Blackadder lot used to use – “plumpening” – which they used to describe the process they went through when they had a gag, then sat about together trying to work out its funniest form. 31st over: India 89-3 (Sudharsan 28, Nair 3) Good loosener from Lil Overton, lifting off a length, but behind it is filth, short, wide, and ignored by Nair, who opts not to risk getting out by leaving along. He then gets off the mark tucking a leg-stump half-volley towards midwicket for two, then the bowler again hits his length – there’s plenty in this track – and Nair removes his bat at the last second. Decent judgment, that, and he gets his rewards when another poor delivery, too straight, allows him to turn around the corner for two more. 30th over: India 85-3 (Sudharsan 28, Nair 0) Atkinson’s on the money immediately, and the more I see of him, the more I’m interested to see if he can insert his bustle, confidence and sense of timing into an Ashes contest. After three dots, he lands one on the seam, Sudharsan comes forward as the ball scrambles, it hits the pad and there’s an appeal, but I think there was an edge and even if not, it was going down. Maiden. Our teams are out, it looks a pleasant afternoon, and there’s a decent chance we get two-and-three-quarter hours of undisturbed cricket. Oh, and now it’s sunny! Atkinson has the ball, and … play. “Listening to cricket,” begins Ian Davis. “One of my maths teachers was Horace Brearley, father of Mike and the school’s cricket coach. During the Test-Match season, it was compulsory someone at the back of the class to be listening to TMS on a new-fangled tranny with the sound turned down so that only the owner could hear it. Every so often, Horace would stop what he was doing and ask for the latest score.” Horace Brearley is a sensational name. We had a similar teacher, who also let us bring in cans occasionally; I’m not certain that’d pass today. It’s a long evening dig, so I’m going to nip off briefly to get a drink; see you in about eight minutes. They’re taking off the last of the big covers, but underneath it is the slippery area that took Woakes off his feet this morning, so there’s still work to do. The covers are coming off and we can, I think, go till 7.30 with a monster evening sesh; the weather might just allow it, too “Sometimes the blog comes into its own with the rain breaks, eh?” chuckles Oli Haill. “Anyway, if I went to a party and they played Summon the Fire by the Comet is Coming, I’d hope I’d be far gone enough to throw off my inhibitions and thrash about dancing like a mad. A negligible cricket connection: the they might be instructions from Stokes/Baz for the fast bowlers.” I’m still thinking what my entry will be – I was hoping someone would stick in Still D.R.E. and Sandstorm by Darude, so I didn’t have to. “Aston Vanilla? Good God.” returns Shaun T. “Also, thanks to Simon McMahon who I think is spot on with his ‘when I was a lad, a Fab, a Zoom or a Mini-Milk being the top of the tree back then..’ And I’d also like to add my Mam’s favourite – Strawberry Split/Mivi (Mivvi,Mivvy ?) - and although technically not a ‘lolly’ as such – ice pops for me. I remember the days when you could get about 10 for 50p or something. No better way to cool right down on a baking hot day, even if the last two or three would’ve turned to drinks by the time you got to them.” I too love a mivvi/mivi/mivvy – the Del Monte modern-day offerings are, while not the same, a pretty good rendition of similar, and much tangier. As it happens, a mate recently bought some ice pops and we were shocked at how much we enjoyed them. They were Mr Freeze, but I’m also a big fan of the ice berger. According to Cricinfo, the rain has chilled a little and part of the cover has come off. Hopefully we get back on soon. “Thank you,” returns Richard O’Hagan – not all all the community is one of the many things that makes this thing of ours special. “In honour of Thorpe’s Karachi innings, can I suggest OBOing in near-darkness tomorrow.” If anyone can get Moin Khan round to shout in my ear, that’d really complete the vibe. Back to our match, Andrew Goudie gets in touch to note that “18% of the total is wides. That’s under-10s stuff. Woakes will go because he’s a good bloke on tour.” Yup, and extras were literally the, or a difference between the sides at Lord’s. I think Stokes and Baz are pretty ruthless, and they’ll know Woakes almost definitely own’t be a factor in Australia unless the summer is a wet one – as it was last time England won there, in 2010-11, though Australia’s bowling options – Bollinger, Beeer, Doherty, Harris before he was brilliant, Johnson before he was terrifying, Hilfenhaus, Siddle and Watson – also had something to do with it. Tangentially, was Johnson’s bowling in Mitch’s Ashes the best most of us have seen against England? I don’t think I’ve seen better, not even Alderman in 1989 or any of the West Indies demolitions. “My little club here in Buckinghamshire, Penn Street CC, are trying to raise £2500 for Opening Up Cricket, an organisation supporting mental health awareness within the game,” says Richard O’Hagan. “We are holding a 24-hour net session from 6pm and would welcome any support that the OBO readers can manage, especially as this Test has been dedicated to the memory of Graham Thorpe. The Just Giving link is worth a look, if only for the chance to marvel at what appears to be my disembodied head floating second from the left.” Great stuff, well done to all – please do help out if you can. On which point, tomorrow is A Day For Thorpey, so Smyth and I have planned to do something special to celebrate one of our cricketing heroes – we’ll start by wearing headbands in his honour, but please feel free to suggest other ideas. So I guess the hope is that we resume at 4.30 or sometime after, and have a long evening session – we can go till 7pm. “You devil, you!” chides Andrew Benton. “I have Fruit Pastilles lollies often, and double them up with blackcurrant-only ones, plus Smarties that I put in the freezer until they are very crunchy and cold – best refreshing summer snack ever. Just what England need during a rain break, in fact.” In similar vein, Jelly Tots and Skittles are also great out of the freezer – as they are in a milkshake. I’m not sure what the players eat during breaks, but KP once told me that Lord’s have by far the best lunches, and being able to wade in was the consolation if you were out in the morning session. “It’s not that I don’t care about this game, or the Ashes,” blasphemes Simon McMahon, “but your mention of Fruit Pastilles ice lollies is, I think, the real hot topic of the day and can’t pass without comment. My two girls, Evie and Anna, loved them, and I suspect still do, though they used to get in a right mess when eating them, especially on hot days, so I hope you’ve taken all relevant precautions. They didn’t exist when I was a lad, a Fab, a Zoom or a Mini-Milk being the top of the tree back then. Thank you for reminding me of the joys of childhood, and indeed parenthood.” Zooms remain elite and surely the inspiration behind Fruit Pastilles. And both taste even better with a bit of post-drop crunch embedded. “Given how much rain there’s been in London today,” writes Andy Flintoff, “and the on-off nature of play, why didn’t they move it to somewhere where it isn’t raining? Like Manchester for instance?” In similar vein, why didn’t they move it to somewhere where it isn’t raining? Like north London for instance?” “You can’t beat a solid pure orange juice one,” reckons Shaun T of ice lollies, “resisting the temptation to take bites when you can have five minutes of licking and savouring instead.... even taking in the stick at the bottom as it melts down.... a real skill in my book. And is it my imagination or did they (do they still??) used to have naff, Christmas-cracker-type jokes on them. I wonder if anyone ever remembers a good one they chuckled at ? Anyway, bloody rain...” You’re talking to someone to crunches one sweet while unwrapping the next – one of many habits which screams ADHD! – but yup, I remember the gags. - What do you get if you cross a football team with an ice cream? - Aston Vanilla. They’ve covered more than the square, which suggests they expect more than just a shower. So here’s the OBO rain playlist to keep you going. But also, might it be time for another? How about the OBO party playlist? Send in your best party tune, no more than one per person, and I’ll collate. “Found a new way to listen to cricket,” exults Tom Bancroft. “Recently got hearing aids, which means I can listen to the cricket without anyone knowing. Have bought a stretching mat which is very comfy to lie on. So far this ‘stretching session’ has lasted an hour. Wife is very impressed.” Great stuff – just the other day I was reading about headphones you can lie on which, with the Ashes in mind, feels like something I need. Although your anecdote also reminds me of the 1992 World Cup final, which clashed with my end of term second-year maths exam. So I stuck an earpiece down the sleeve of my blazer and updated the class, none of who cared, via cough-talking. “Fairbrother’s out” still haunts me to this day. Can I tell you a secret? I’ve just gone to get myself a Fruit Pastilles ice lolly, the absolute mother and father of the genre. Don’t tell my parents. It’s heavier than a few minutes ago, and I’m afraid it’s going to be this kind of day. Hopefully we’ll get the pitch covered so we can get going again as soon as it’s stopped, but for now, we are bereft of cricket – but not the talking of nonsense. 29th over: India 85-3 (Sudharsan 28, Nair 0) Two dots then two wides, and it’s now raining steadily again; we might get the end of this over and another, but if it doesn’t let up, they’ll have to come off. Meantime, Overton completes his over with a decent delivery which lifts off a length to rattle Nair in the gizzard. “I’ve enjoyed your thoughts on the England line-up for the Ashes,” begins Tom van der Gucht, “and I’ve been giving some thoughts regarding the next steps for this quixotic and entertaining England team. Bringing Bethell in today at least brings some excitement with a mercurial talent having a pop at the champ, but I’m also keen to see what the future brings with the likes of Ahmed growing as a potential all-rounder. I’d like to see him given a bash in the ODI series later this summer at number 3 (giving Root a rest) although, I suspect the Ashes might arrive too soon for his second coming yet it would be great to see him fighting for a berth in the Test squad.” At this point, it feels like they’ve invested too much in Bashir to pick another Test spinner ahead of him. I’d not be surprised if England don’t bother with a spinner at Brisbane, but if they do, it’ll be him or Root/Bethell, I think. Which isn’t to say I’m not interested to see more of Ahmed, I am. 28th over: India 83-3 (Sudharsan 28, Nair 0) That was really good work from Atkinson and you can see the crowd cavorting behind Gill as the horror sets in; sport is evil and wonderful. Getting run out is bad enough, getting run out like that is worse, and getting run out like that as captain is just absolute worsts. Nair, back in the side and under pressure, sees out the wicket maiden; the final delivery nips off the seam and though I think he plays inside it, it reminds us that there’s plenty of juice in this pitch. A fifth-Test dismissal if ever I saw one. Gill defends towards mid-off and decides he wants a run when there isn’t one there for him; following through, Atkinson collects and has time to steady before taking aim, throwing down the stumps, one bounce, as Gill slips on the turn. The India captain will be feeling very, very poorly, his insides leaping out through his mouth and nose. 27th over: India 83-2 (Sudharsan 28, Gill 21) Gill dabs to the side of gully for one, then Overton narrowly misses Sudharsan’s off-stump, following up with one that lifts, kissing the batter’s fingers; there’s something in this track, but can the bowlers bowl well enough and consistently enough to exploit it? Perhaps so! The final delivery of the over beats Sudharsan and Overton thinks he heard an edge – I do too – but no one else agrees. 26th over: India 82-2 (Sudharsan 28, Gill 20) Sudharsan takes two to cover, then rotates the strike by turning to deep backward square; Atkinson then squares Gill up, the ball squirting towards point, and the batter has to a send his partner back before trouble ensues. A single and a no-ball, called late, follow … then a wild, high wide means an eighth ball – Atkinson is staking his claim for Australia – and it’s much better, beating Sudharsan outside off. 25th over: India 76-2 (Sudharsan 25, Gill 19) Overton badly needs a better spell than he produced this morning and his third ball is decent, moving away and leaving Gill rummaging for it; he somehow diverts it to point, not to leg, where he’d planned for it to go. Then, after two fgurther dots, Gill steps into a picturesque cover-drive that races away for four. “Good afternoon from Barcelona! Wishing I could send the sun over, says Risho Malhotra. “Honestly, Virat and Rohit’s test returns were diminishing and nobody seems to mention this,” s. “I’m missing the days of Ishant-Shami-Bumrah. Our last 10 test matches have shown how important they were.” I agree – those players won’t necessarily be missed on account of what they were no longer delivering, but you can’t fail to notice the absence of champions who’ve done it all – from the dressing room, but also in terms of the security their presence offers and the knowhow they offer. 24th over: India 72-2 (Sudharsan 25, Gill 15) Atkinson was the pick of the bowlers this morning, which I guess I find interesting. It felt to me like his summer last term was a level or two above his actual level, but you get some players who are obviously brilliant and others who, every time they’re challenged, up their level; perhaps he’s one of those. Either way, Ben Stokes will have a difficult choice to make at the Gaba; Archer will play if fit, but I can’t make an honest case for Woakes on Australian pitches, while Tongue, Overton or Carse will be in the conversation but not automatic picks. Maiden. Here we go, Atkinson with the ball. Back come our teams; hopefully we’re done with rain, but there’s more of it on the radar, we’re told. I was lucky enough to be at Durham this Test. This streak also has a special place in my heart: a group of us decided we’d stay away from the cricket at work to sit down together in the viewing and watch the full day. Not bad. On Sky, Athers is reading a narrative poem he wrote about Stuart Broad and I think my eyeballs might be sweating: the warmth of feeling; someone making the most of themselves and their life; and the sense of the passing years, has absolutely done for me. What an absolute champion; a champion and a mensch. Thanks Taha and good moderate afternoon everyone. It’s raining again, but the hope is that it’s a passing shower and we’re still good for a 3pm resumption. And on that note, I’ll pass the baton to Daniel Harris. Keep him company with the emails. Thanks for joining me! Yep, it was coming. It’s raining again and the covers are coming back on. The revised timings for today are in: Afternoon session: 3pm-5.05pm Evening session: 5.25pm-7pm, with an extra half-hour for overs not bowled. Arunachalam Vaidyanathan writes: As an Indian fan I have to say I’m very frustrated with the team selection. India under kohli when they were at their best was when they picked teams with the goal of taking 20 wickets and trusted the front line batsmen, nowadays the team selection seems to be more defensive . Also as an aside what happened to Matthew potts, I remember being impressed by him An excellent point on Potts, who not only has a very handy Test CV – 36 wickets at 29.44 – but also a very decent fitness record over the last few years. He’d do a very handy job in these conditions. We’ll be back then … though the Met Office forecast suggests we’re on for more trouble. A first sight of Oasis merch at this Test, with someone in the stands rocking the new Adidas collaboration top. What a double-header that is: Wembley last night, the Oval today. Here’s a tenuous connection between cricket and the band. Sotheby’s has announced that a 1996 painting of the brothers by Elizabeth Peyton is to be part of its June contemporary art auction in London. It was based on a photograph of the brothers taken by Stefan De Batselier in 1995, the year Noel is said to have hit his brother with a cricket bat. Another inspection at 2.30pm BST says Sky. Keep those emails coming in while we wait. Peter Salmon writes in: Haven’t hear much chat about the fact that Shubman Gill started this match needing a mere 253 runs to go past Bradman for most runs ever in a series. He’s gone past Sobers, Faulkner, Gower, Gavaskar and Sutcliffe already today in 15 runs and even 100 in this match would put him into eighth. Might be fun if he needs a few runs in the last session of day 5 to go past The Don, and Pope tries to shake hands for a draw... Still a long way to go, but definitely one to keep an eye on. He did look in excellent nick this morning, enjoying some loose deliveries from Jamie Overton. Tom Wilson writes in after digging deep on Statsguru: Root and Ponting do have quite similar records but with one key difference - the one country Root has struggled in is Australia (average 35.68), whilst Ponting’s struggles came in India (average 26.48). Otherwise both have 40++ averages all over (taking out Root’s two tests in Bangladesh, and Ponting’s one test in Zimbabwe). Fortunately for Root, there’s a big opportunity to rectify that anomaly coming next... It’s funny to me how we talk about Root in Australia (this is not a critique of Tom’s point). Yes, a century would be good, quite important to elevate him in the discussion of greats, but he’s never been dreadful there. He averaged 47.25 in the 17/18 series; 17 more runs in the first innings at Sydney and how different the conversation would be. Felix Wood writes in: Is this Woakes’ last hurrah? He’s been fairly ineffective this summer, certainly not deserving of the new ball in my opinion, and he’d be a liability in Australia. I don’t agree with his being unlucky - if you beat the bat that many times without taking an edge then it’s more likely that your length is slightly off. I don’t see England getting anywhere near 20 wickets this test, could we really not have wheeled Jimmy out for a surprise one of come-back? He’d have had India five down by now in these conditions. He’s certainly in a difficult spot. It’s been a tough summer for every bowler so his numbers have to be placed in that context. As for Australia, he’s never had a great time abroad … but England have shown a desire to have one steady, controlling hand in their attack, with Woakes trusted in that role over the last year, even in Pakistan and New Zealand. In other words, I don’t know. We’ve got an inspection at 2pm BST. The covers are making their way off. If you really need immediate action, Tanya Aldred’s helming the county blog. The rain has relented, time for the major clean-up job. Stephen Brown emailed in earlier: Really looking forward to this test and actually a bit annoyed with myself for not getting tickets. This idea is probably a week late, but I can’t get over how similar Root and Ponting’s stats are. Root has edged 29 runs ahead, but they have batter in basically the same number of innings, faced an incredibly similar number of balls (Root has faced 2.5% more), high scores within 5 of each other, and averages and strike rates that aren’t far apart. The biggest difference probably comes from the smallest number which is that Root has only hit 45 sixes, to Ponting’s 73. I can’t help feeling like there is a lesson in there to the likes of Duckett etc. in the way the game should be played if you want to be an all time great by the time you retire. I think it’s 31 runs ahead (sorry to be that guy) but your point still stands: very similar records. I wouldn’t ask Duckett to change his game, though – he’s doing a brilliant job at the top order. It’s properly thundering down at the Oval. I reckon we’re on for a pretty significant delay. 23rd over: India 72-2 (Sudharsan 25, Gill 15) Gill has looked untroubled so far, while Overton closes his over with hands on hips, still not happy with how he’s landing at the crease. And then, out of nowhere, it starts pouring! Time for a break and early lunch. 22nd over: India 68-2 (Sudharsan 25, Gill 11) Sudharsan has done a lot of hard work and he advances into the twenties with a lovely straight drive off Woakes for four. He’s slowly easing himself in. 21st over: India 62-2 (Surdharsan 19, Gill 11) Gill pulls imperiously for one and makes hay with the final ball, cutting a poor delivery from Overton for four. 20th over: India 56-2 (Sudharsan 18, Gill 6) The floodlights are finally off, the sun properly beaming down. Sudharsan continues to play inside the line against Woakes, the ball whistling past his outside edge. The release of pressure comes with one on the pads, Sudharsan glancing to the fine-leg rope for four. 19th over: India 52-2 (Sudharsan 14, Gill 6) Jamie Overton, three years on from his Test debut, is back, bowling on his home ground. Replacing Tongue, he’s erratic, too; a wide outside off is followed by a long hop, Gill cutting comfortably for four. The sun is out now at the Oval yet the lights are still on. Overton is clearly not happy with how he’s landing at the crease as he drops short to Gill, Pope doing well at midwicket to stop the boundary. A beaut closes the over, Overton getting an outswinger to beat Gill’s bat. 18th over: India 46-2 (Sudharsan 13, Gill 2) Gill clips Woakes off his pads, nearly bringing Jacob Bethell into play at midwicket … it drops just short, claimed on the half-volley. 17th over: India 44-2 (Sudharsan 13, Gill 0) Lovely from Sudharsan – who knows this ground well as an overseas pro with Surrey – on-driving Tongue for four. 16th over: India 40-2 (Sudharsan 9, Gill 0) The sun has poked through at the Oval, but it’s not easy out there for the two batters. Woakes gets some serious nip away from Sudharsan before Shubman Gill leaves his first delivery of the day. That’s big. Rahul was the more comfortable one at the crease but he brings out the wrong shot against Woakes, cutting when he needed to show the straight bat, inside-edging on to his stumps. 15th over: India 38-1 (Sudharsan 8, Rahul 14) Tongue continues from the Vauxhall End, Pope backing him with a packed slip cordon. He gets the ball to leap off a length and Sudharsan does pretty well to keep the ball down and safe. An attempted cut goes wrong with the next delivery as Sudharsan plays out five dots, stuck on eight off 43 deliveries. 14th over: India 37-1 (Sudharsan 8, Rahul 14) Woakes is back to have a go from the Pavilion End, with Sudharsan still trying to settle in. Rahul is completely locked in and fairly untroubled as he claims the only run of the over. John Donnellan, I’ve got you sorted: Hi everybody from an overcast Spiddal in county Galway. It’s our last day at work before our summer holidays and we’re all winding down. I can’t speak for any of my colleagues but I’m in bad need of some live commentary to get me through to 5pm. Anyone out there with a link to the overseas TMS. Here you go. Vikram Prasad asks: Apologies if I got this wrong (its still before my 2nd cup of coffee early in Michigan), but does this mark the 16th time in a row India has lost the toss? That has ~1 in 32000 odds assuming a truly unbiased coin and the usual caveats about randomness..... It’s not that bad. It’s just their 15th failed coin toss in a row. 13th over: India 36-1 (Sudharsan 8, Rahul 13) A snorter from Tongue! He’s got this delivery in him, a yorker that floors Sudharsan … actually, upon replay, it’s a low full toss that the left-hander inside-edges on to his pads. It prompted a full-blooded leg-before shout, though. Tongue goes too wide of off stump later in the over, and Sudharsan punches down the ground for two to close it. Time for drinks, with Tongue still trying to find his radar. 12th over: India 34-1 (Sudharsan 6, Rahul 13) Pope is backing his Surrey teammate to strike again in this spell; Atkinson thunders in for his sixth over. He gets the ball to nip away from Rahul, a gorgeous delivery, and closes another tight set. He has figures of one for seven. 11th over: India 33-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 13) Tongue has got the wides out of his system and closes a maiden with a testing nip-backer to Rahul. It’s a quality leave from the right-hander. 10th over: India 33-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 13) The lights are on at the Oval as Atkinson continues, immaculate with his line to Sudharsan, getting the ball to zigzag. Smith produces an excellent diving take to close the over. 9th over: India 30-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 10) Ollie Pope makes his first change of the morning, with Josh Tongue replacing Woakes. His first delivery is way off, a wide down the leg side that runs to the boundary. Rahul masterfully gets off strike, dabbing into the ground to nick a single. Tongue goes around the wicket to Sudharsan and hoops one down the leg side before producing another wide, this time outside off stump. He seems to be struggling with his landing at the crease, and out comes another ball that runs away for five wides down leg. This is a wild start but he eventually finds his spot, closing with a fine ball past the outside edge. 8th over: India 18-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 9) The action is coming from Atkinson’s end, the quick steaming in with the pavilion behind him. There’s decent carry on the way to Jamie Smith, and no messing about with his line. It’s another fine over, with just one off it. 7th over: India 17-1 (Sudharsan 5, Rahul 8) Four slips and a gully wait for Sudharsan to err. Woakes, from over the wicket, unfurls a beauty, nipping the ball away from the left-hander. He’s surely been waiting all series for these conditions. Sudharsan then receives a gift, though, on the pads and clipped past leg slip for four. 6th over: India 13-1 (Sudharsan 1, Rahul 8) Atkinson is fresh, clocking in the mid-80s as he tries to nip the ball away from Rahul. He hangs it around fifth stump and Rahul is forced to get out the leave. A maiden. 5th over: India 13-1 (Sudharsan 1, Rahul 8) Sudharsan gets going with a dab into the offside for one before Woakes, still searching for the right areas, ends with a tempter wide of off stump. 4th over: India 10-1 (Sudharsan 0, Rahul 7) Atkinson has rhythm as he beats the bat of Sai Sudharsan, the No 3 still trying to lock down his position. Atkinson launches into an lbw appeal after going full to Jaiswal from around the wicket … England review. Here comes DRS: there’s no bat on it, and it looks pretty plumb … gone, smashing into leg stump! Atkinson is back, that wobble/scramble seam (I’m not too sure, but that’s the point), causing havoc. 3rd over: India 9-0 (Jaiswal 2, Rahul 7) Rahul has his first boundary, clipping to the midwicket rope, Jamie Overton’s dive and slide unable to stop it. Woakes hasn’t go the ball hooping yet, as Jaiswal inside-edges for one to stay on strike for the next over. 2nd over: India 3-0 (Jaiswal 1, Rahul 2) In sprints Gus Atkinson, on his home ground, for his first bit of action in this series. He gets the wobble seam to nip past Jaiswal’s off stump, a Rahul single the only damage from the over. 1st over: India 2-0 (Jaiswal 1, Rahul 1) We’re up and away with Chris Woakes – soldiering on for all five Tests – running in. Yashasvi Jaiswal tucks him away for one off the second ball of the over, and Rahul, brilliant all series, is up and way immediately. Woakes beats Jaiswal’s outside edge with the final ball to get the crowd going. Rohan Tewari is concerned, too: Looking forward to a morning where the contest between bat and ball is (hopefully!) more even than what we have seen all summer. I can’t get behind India’s team selection here though. If they want to square the series 2-2, the burden is on them to take 20 wickets. With only 3 strike bowlers (one of them being a dodgy 3rd seamer) I’m not sure I see India’s route to victory and a possible repeat of Headingley. Such a shame that we haven’t seen Kuldeep. He doesn’t need the pitch to be suitable: he’s got the revs and flight to cause trouble anywhere. The covers were on for a bit, but they’re off now. We should be starting at 11. Krishnamoorthy v writes: The omission of Kuldeep yadav is baffling. The current bowling line up of 5 bowlers out of which two are all rounders does not make sense. Scoring 700 will not ensure victory if you do not have the capability to take 20 wickets. England realized it at OT. By the way, has there ever been a player who toured and went back without playing a test in a 5-test series? Kuldeep isn’t alone, of course. Arshdeep Singh hasn’t played for India this series either. Patrick Fullick writes: The weather this morning reflects my general feeling about this match. I’ve really enjoyed the series so far, but the atmosphere today - coming hard on the heels of the OT test - feels like the pitches so far: very flat. Here’s hoping for a good game for England to win the series. Will be following the match here and on TMS. I’m banking on some wickets this morning to cheer you up, Patrick. There is no Jasprit Bumrah, as expected. India have been confused about their team all summer and they look it again. Karun Nair, dropped at Old Trafford, is back in. He’s one of four changes; once again, there is no Kuldeep Yadav. England: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope (c), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jacob Bethell, Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, Josh Tongue India: Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Washington Sundar, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj Ollie Pope wins it and England will bowl first. It’s green, it’s overcast, it’s pretty much a no-brainer. Matt Dony writes in: Your preamble makes it sound a bit like Stokes has been replaced by 3 players. Which makes complete sense, as it often feels like he’s worth at least three ‘normal’ cricketers. Ben Stokes the inspirational captain, Ben Stokes the outrageously gifted cricketer, Ben Stokes the maelstrom of personality and will-to-win. I don’t think I’ve ever seen another sportsperson who just makes things happen around him like Stokes does. He’s astonishing. It is a proper conundrum trying to replace him. They’ve brought in Jacob Bethell at six but, on this surface, that requires someone to make up Stokes’ overs as a quick. You’re basically calling up two people to replace him. Time to get stuck in to some preview material: Stuart Broad is having a look at the green pitch and says “it’s a definite win-the-toss-and-bowl”. Ben Stokes has been having a chat with Sky. He talks about his braced front leg helping him bowl the way he’s done this summer, and is asked about the spiciness of this series: “Honestly, I think it gets over-egged sometimes, massively. It’s something as players that we don’t lose sleep over. If there’s a bit of niggle out there, it’s part of the game.” Hello, hello, hello and welcome to a damp Oval. We’ve had the handshakes that didn’t happen and the pitch palaver, but we’ve also got this: a fifth Test, with the series yet to be decided. I’ll embrace that, as should you. I’m staring at a greenish surface, one the Indian players are getting a pretty decent look at; I’m intrigued to see how a refreshed, rather experimental England attack goes on it. A reminder, there’s no Ben Stokes, with Josh Tongue, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton all shipped in. There’s plenty to talk about even before the action starts. Drop me a line, and let’s enjoy the last proper show of the summer.
