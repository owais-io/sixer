  Australia has announced that it will list Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
  Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist group, after the country’s intelligence agency
  determined that it had directed at least two attacks against Australia’s
  Jewish community. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Australia’s
  domestic spy agency had “credible intelligence” that attacks against a
  synagogue in Melbourne and Jewish restaurant in Sydney were “directed by the
  IRGC.” The Iranian ambassador to Australia, Ahmad Sadeghi, will be expelled
  and Australia’s embassy in Tehran will suspend operations. Who are the IRGC?
  The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are one of the most feared and powerful
  organisations in Iran, whose influence stretches beyond military and
  intelligence to politics, education and the economy. Established after the
  1979 Islamic revolution, the IRGC operates separate to – and often contrary to
  – Iran’s traditional military. It is an elite force, loyal to the country’s
  supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and has grown in size and power over
  the decades. With ground troops numbering more than 150,000, the IRGC also
  runs its own navy and air force, separate from Iran’s regular armed forces. It
  oversees the country’s ballistic missile programme, once regarded as the
  largest in the Middle East but which was widely incapacitated during Israel’s
  attacks on Iran’s nuclear sites in June. Have other countries sanctioned the
  IRGC? The US designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2019,
  during Donald Trump’s first administration. Canada followed in 2024. The EU
  and UK have indicated that they plan to list the IRGC but have yet to do so.
  The US state department has accused the IRGC of being directly involved in
  terrorist plotting. In 2024, Argentina’s highest criminal court blamed the
  IRGC and Hezbollah for a 1994 attack against a Jewish community centre in
  Buenos Aires which killed 85 people. Iran has said it was not involved. In
  2020, an IRGC missile operator shot down a Ukraine Airlines flight moment
  after it took off from Tehran airport, killing 176 people. An IRGC official
  said the plane had been misidentified as a cruise missile. In 2024, an IRGC
  official was among three men charged in the US over an attempted plot to
  kidnap and assassinate an Iranian-American journalist in New York. All three
  men were based in Iran and remain at large. How influential are the IRGC in
  Iran’s domestic politics? Former IRGC officers have held key positions in
  Iran’s politics and the group’s mandate to protect “revolutionary values” has
  seen it become a powerful force in policing social and cultural issues in the
  country. Overseen by the supreme leader, the IRGC is often seen as more
  powerful than the country’s president and are thought to have more sway on
  foreign policy. The group oversees some educational institutions and has
  pushed research into aerospace and drone technology to advance its military
  capabilities. It has economic interests that span construction and
  telecommunications to oil and gas projects – and it’s thought the IRGC is
  behind the vast network of shadow tankers that has seen Iran circumvent
  western sanctions on its oil exports. What role does it play internationally?
  The Quds Force is responsible for the IRGC’s overseas operations. It has
  sponsored and armed groups across the Middle East, including Hamas in Gaza,
  Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Known in Tehran as the Axis of
  Resistance, these groups helped to push Iran’s influence abroad, but have been
  dismantled and degraded to varying degrees over the course of almost two years
  of conflict with Israel, after the 7 October attacks and the start of the war
  in Gaza. The Quds force itself has also suffered major blows, with many of its
  most senior commanders killed in Israel’s attacks on Iran in June. Qassem
  Suleimani, the feared and renowned commander of the Quds force, was killed by
  a US drone strike in 2020.
