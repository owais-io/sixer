  Monday I’m not sure I can bring myself to actually read it, but the
  publication this week of Entitled: the Rise and Fall of the House of York, by
  Andrew Lownie, promises to enliven a dead patch of summer with – putting
  Jeffrey Epstein aside – a wealth of petty revelations, a jog back through
  Prince Andrew’s most ridiculous episodes and an opportunity to use the phrase,
  “the disgraced duke”. Shall we? Lownie’s unauthorised 400-page book goes deep
  into the history of the royal family’s biggest liability, a man who, per the
  author’s sources, screams at his staff (sample quote: “who’s the fucking idiot
  who cut the meat up?”) in a way reminiscent of no one more so than that other
  famously rude member of the royal family, the late Princess Margaret. It
  covers the battle for Royal Lodge, in which the late queen’s second son is
  depicted as hanging on by his fingernails to the 30-room property in Windsor
  while behind the scenes Prince William works to get him out. Disappointingly,
  there are no specifics as to the exact nature of the “rude” remark Andrew
  allegedly made to Kate, the Princess of Wales. But the duke’s many
  eccentricities are itemised, including the stuffed animals on his bed well
  into adulthood, the daily “air showers” in which he sits on the balcony with
  his eyes shut sucking in air, and the enduring oddness of his relationship
  with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, whose long life of grift and overspending,
  according to Lownie, includes running up £4,000 in extra baggage charges by
  taking 25 suitcases on holiday. Ryanair would never allow it. On Andrew’s
  friendship with Epstein, the author writes, shrewdly I think, that “the prince
  was a useful idiot who gave [Epstein] respectability and access to political
  leaders and business opportunities”. Per the book, Andrew is venal, thick and
  often just nasty. One story recounts a camping trip he took at the age of 13,
  during which he threw his friends’ groundsheets in the river as a joke. “He
  thinks he’s funny, handsome and clever,” says the source of the story. “And he
  isn’t … He was a tosser.” Which, funnily enough, if Lownie is to be believed,
  is the same word used by Prince William to describe his uncle. Tuesday To the
  country’s second royal family, the House of Beckham, where trouble comes this
  week in the form of the latest round of hostilities between eldest son
  Brooklyn and the rest of the clan. It’s now jumped from online snubs and coded
  insults to IRL estrangement as Brooklyn renews his wedding vows in America in
  a ceremony to which none of his family are invited. The real story, however,
  continues to play out most forcefully on Instagram, a mirror world in which
  the family arguably lives their fullest and most meaningful life. It’s no
  trivial breach, in these circumstances, that Romeo and Cruz have blocked
  Brooklyn on the platform (they have also blocked Brooklyn’s wife, Nicola
  Peltz). It’s hugely significant, as the Sun noted this week, that Cruz dropped
  the comment “wrong brother, mate” when a follower teased him on Insta for
  changing jobs every five minutes. And now, this: Victoria Beckham, who has
  been faithfully liking her oldest’s son’s interminable cooking videos even as
  the rest of the family has held firm and ignored him, has finally hit her
  ceiling. At the time of writing, Brooklyn’s mother hasn’t liked any of the
  photos of the renewal ceremony from which she and the rest of the Beckhams
  were excluded. Wednesday Hang on to your attention spans, a second season of
  With Love, Meghan is coming down the pike on Netflix and promises to be even
  more enchanting and whimsical than the first. Per the trailer, it looks as if
  Mindy Kaling is out after appearing to irritate Meghan in the first season,
  and her rival lifestyle influencer Chrissy Teigen is in to help Meghan get out
  of her “comfort zone” by slicing a loaf of bread and handling a salad. The
  show also promises “a confession about Prince Harry’s diet”. (Spoiler alert:
  he doesn’t like lobster.) To followers of the Archewell story, it might come
  as a surprise to learn that a second season has been ordered at all, although
  the volume of hate watchers of the first season probably pushed it towards
  modest success. Season two comes at a moment when Netflix is, reportedly,
  downgrading its relationship with the couple by moving from an original deal
  reported to have been worth $100m to a less lucrative “first look” arrangement
  after a slew of projects never came to fruition. Thursday It’s A-level results
  day and while teenagers celebrate their results and weather the opinion
  pieces, Tatler magazine puts together a helpful reminder of royal exam success
  over the ages. Let’s start with the king, bless him, who had a notoriously
  rough ride at Gordonstoun, where he passed five O-levels and two A-levels,
  achieving a B in history and a C in French. A generation down and the
  country’s most expensive education won Prince William three A-levels, in
  geography (A), art (B) and biology (C), while his brother managed two, a B in
  art and a D in geography – and unlike his father, made the sensible decision
  not to use the royal wild card to go on to Cambridge. And while it isn’t known
  what grades Prince Andrew achieved with his six O-levels and three A-levels,
  in 2008 the duke’s daughter, Princess Eugenie, gained by far the most
  impressive A-level tally of any recent royal with two As and a B in art,
  history of art, and English. As Tatler notes, the palace was so thrilled by
  this anomaly “they actually sent out a statement so they could tell the
  world”. Friday An alarm call put out by English Heritage announces the demise
  of the traditional British pudding, and until recently I’d have said not a
  moment too soon. I am just old enough to remember someone putting a steaming
  bowl of yellow slop in front of me and calling it “spotted dick”. Young people
  who grew up eating Shake Shack frozen custard have no idea what “custard” used
  to mean, or encountered the spirit-sinking associations that come with the
  phrase “hot pudding”. Anyway, after eating an amazing sticky toffee pudding
  innocently ordered by my 10-year-old on the Isle of Wight last week, I have
  completely changed my mind and am joining the campaign. Save humid
  sponge-based puddings with gluey sauces before it’s too late!
