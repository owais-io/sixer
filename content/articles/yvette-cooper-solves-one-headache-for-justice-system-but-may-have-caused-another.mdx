  By getting her way and allowing police to consider disclosing the ethnicity
  and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile cases, Yvette Cooper has
  solved one enormous headache for the criminal justice system. But she may have
  caused another, which could have consequences for race relations. The home
  secretary has encouraged senior police officers to free themselves of
  longstanding protocols so they can combat the prolific use of social media by
  far-right bloggers and organisations that have escalated disinformation around
  high-profile incidents. Last summer’s national riots were fomented from an
  early stage by misinformation about the Southport killer – he was claimed, in
  posts recycled tens of thousands of times, to be a Muslim, foreign-born and an
  asylum seeker. All three statements turned out to be wrong. Until today, there
  was nothing in the College of Policing’s guidance that actually prevented
  police giving information about the nationality, asylum status or even
  ethnicity of someone who has been charged. The police are restricted as to
  what they can say about suspects. But the guidance on media relations – and
  what would be released to the public – said that if someone was arrested,
  police should only give the suspect’s gender and age. Once a suspect was
  charged, the guidance said police could give out the suspect’s name, date of
  birth and address. Before 2012, police forces made decisions on what
  information to give to the media on a purely case-by-case basis, decisions
  often made depending on the force’s relationship with individual journalists
  and media outlets. But it was Lord Leveson’s damning 2012 report on press
  ethics that prompted police forces to become more cautious because of concerns
  that releasing the ethnicity of suspects could be used to feed false
  narratives. Leveson examined testimony from the National Union of Journalists
  claiming that some national newsrooms openly encouraged racist reporting. One
  reporter was told by the news editor to “write a story about Britain being
  flooded by asylum-seeking bummers”, another was told to “make stories as
  rightwing as you can” and another was told to go out and find Muslim women to
  photograph, with the instruction: “Just fucking do it. Wrap yourself around a
  group of women in burkas for a photo,” the testimony said. He examined
  numerous reports including a Daily Star article under the headline “Asylum
  seekers eat our donkeys,” which claimed that donkey meat was a speciality in
  Somalia and eastern Europe and blamed asylum seekers, without any evidence.
  Leveson concluded that “when assessed as a whole, the evidence of
  discriminatory, sensational or unbalanced reporting in relation to ethnic
  minorities, immigrants and/or asylum seekers, is concerning”. Fast-forward 12
  years to Southport, and Merseyside police were left making decisions on
  whether to release information on the ethnicity and nationality of the killer
  of three young girls in order to dispel public anger that had spilled on to
  the streets. Senior officers had to deal with major criminal incidents and
  took days to dispel social media untruths. Such disinformation was at least
  partly responsible for last summer’s riots. At the time, Merseyside police
  said they were not giving out more information because of the contempt of
  court rules. It is hoped that the new guidance will mean police will no longer
  be left flat-footed when responding to viral social media posts by extremists.
  Decisions on releasing such information will remain with police forces, with
  wider legal and ethical considerations also taken into account, the National
  Police Chiefs’ Council said, but verifying a suspect’s immigration status is
  up to the Home Office. There is concern among some former police and race
  campaigners that Cooper’s change will undo the restrictions imposed after
  Leveson and fuel racist sentiments. The former Met chief superintendent Dal
  Babu has warned of the “unintended consequences” of the new guidance, which he
  said could lead to more online speculation in cases where these details are
  not released. “The danger is there will be an expectation for police to
  release information on every single occasion,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today
  programme. The Home Office says it will not be encouraging the release of
  ethnicity and immigration status in all cases, and there are notable occasions
  when it has not. But a former race adviser to No 10 said: “Yvette has
  unwittingly opened a Pandora’s box. After every charge, everyone with a union
  jack on their X bio will demand from the police the ethnicity of the suspect.
  “The Home Office is going to get even more demands for the asylum status of
  every Black or brown suspect. It is going to be chaos, and has handed Nigel
  Farage another stick to beat Labour with.” There could well be a knock-on
  effect on mainstream reporting and community relations, campaigners believe.
  Enny Choudhury, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said:
  “Releasing the ethnicity of everyone suspected of serious crimes will do
  nothing to help victims or secure justice – it will simply fuel mistrust,
  deepen divisions, and make Black and brown communities more vulnerable to
  prejudice and harm.”
