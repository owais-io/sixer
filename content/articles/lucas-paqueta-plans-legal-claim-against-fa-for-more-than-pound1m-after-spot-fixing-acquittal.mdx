  Lucas Paquetá is planning to launch a legal claim for more than £1m in costs
  against the Football Association after the publication of the regulatory
  commission’s 314-page report that cleared the West Ham player of spot-fixing.
  The Guardian has learned that while Paquetá is unlikely to sue the FA for
  damages for lost earnings from its two-year case against him, which led to the
  collapse of a proposed £85m transfer to Manchester City in the summer of 2023,
  the 27-year-old will make a claim to recover legal costs of between £1m and
  £1.5m. Paquetá’s case would appear to have been strengthened by the
  commission’s report, which highlighted numerous “flaws” in the FA’s handling
  of the case. Major elements of the FA’s prosecution were described as
  “surprising”, “concerning” and “contradictory” by the commission, which also
  criticised the governing body for failing to call an independent expert to
  assess the 253 suspicious bets on the four bookings the Brazilian was alleged
  to have fixed. Paquetá’s lawyers are expected to argue that flaws in the
  investigation caused delays in the case, at considerable cost to the player
  and West Ham, who unsuccessfully petitioned the FA for an expedited hearing
  last year after he was charged with four counts of spot-fixing in May 2024.
  His lawyers will also insist that the FA pay the costs incurred by the
  commission, which given the length and complexity of the case are expected to
  run into several hundred thousand pounds. The FA is facing a bill of about £1m
  for its own legal expenses, which it will be unable to recover, and the cost
  of bringing the case against Paquetá could end up at close to £3m if his claim
  is successful. All decisions on costs will be made by the commission at a new
  hearing, which will also determine Paquetá’s punishment for two lesser charges
  of failing to cooperate and share information with the FA. West Ham have no
  plans to take legal action against the FA, which has said it will not appeal
  against the commission’s verdict.
