  Inflation is down but prices remain high: when will the cost-of-living crisis
  end?

  Inflation has come down from the stratospheric peaks of December 2022,
  dropping to 2.1% in the year to June and towards the bottom of the Reserve
  Bank’s 2-3% target range. That’s the good news: things generally aren’t
  getting more expensive at the same breakneck pace that they were a couple of
  years ago. Then there’s the bad news: the biggest inflationary shock in a
  generation has left Australia a much more expensive place than it was before
  the pandemic. And it could take years for households to catch up. The headline
  inflation measure we use is the percentage change in the price of a basket of
  goods and services, and when it’s positive that means the price of things is
  still increasing. So even though inflation is now “back to normal”, prices
  have generally remained at higher levels than usual and for the most part are
  likely to stay that way. We’re very unlikely to see prices go down across the
  board (this would be deflation and would mean that something quite bad is
  happening to the economy). Sign up: AU Breaking News email So if prices are
  much higher and are still rising, the question is: when will the
  cost-of-living crisis be over? Enter wage growth. For the higher prices to
  feel “normal” again, we need enough growth in people’s wages (and other forms
  of income) to compensate for all the inflation that occurred over the last
  couple of years. Economists refer to this concept as “purchasing power”, or
  how much your dollar can buy. One way to figure out how long this might take
  is to compare the cumulative increase in inflation (the change in the consumer
  price index, or CPI) since 2020 with the cumulative increase in the wage price
  index (WPI), and then make some assumptions about how much they might increase
  in the future. Once cumulative wage growth overtakes the overall increase in
  consumer prices, then we’re finally back to living costs feeling like they did
  in 2020. So how long will this be? Well, if inflation averages 2.5% per year
  from now on (the midpoint of the Reserve Bank’s 2-3% target range), and wage
  growth averages 3.5%, things won’t feel normal for at least another three
  years: You can change the assumptions in the chart for higher or lower values
  and see what you get, though the time series from the present onwards is
  capped at 10 years. (Another way of doing this is to combine the two indices
  to get “real wages”.) However, the wage price and consumer price indices are
  just one narrow way to look at this issue. WPI measures hourly wage and salary
  rates, so it doesn’t capture other aspects of a worker’s compensation like
  additional hours worked or promotions, according to Trent Wiltshire, an
  economist at the Grattan Institute. Wiltshire says there are other measures,
  such as average weekly earnings, that can measure people’s income in a more
  comprehensive way. “There are broader measures [than WPI] that capture the
  fact that people can work more hours in a stronger labour market, and in a
  stronger labour market people are more likely to get promoted if they’re
  switching jobs, or if firms are keen to keep workers,” he said. “One of the
  great things we’ve seen since Covid is that unemployment has remained low, but
  it has taken a while for that to flow through to higher wages.” Weekly
  earnings have increased faster than WPI over the past two years, meaning that
  if we index them to compare with CPI in a similar way, then they have just
  caught up. And on the inflation side, the Australian Bureau of Statistics also
  publishes a better measure of cost of living than CPI, though it is less
  known. The selected living cost index series shows how price changes affect
  the living costs of different types of households. The most notable difference
  is that the employee living cost index includes the impact of the change in
  mortgage interest rates, whereas CPI doesn’t. So it has grown even more
  strongly than CPI, due to rate rises in 2022 and 2023. Here, we can compare
  the higher living cost index to see how things have changed since 2020 and how
  much earnings would have to grow to catch up: Even using these broader and
  more realistic measures of income and living costs, we end up with the same
  story: cost of living could remain a major issue for Australians until early
  2029. Of course, a lot can happen over the coming years to change this grim
  outlook. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has switched his focus from getting
  inflation back under control to ways to boost growth – his economic reform
  roundtable later this month will hopefully create some good ideas to this end.
  But reforms tend to take a while to bear fruit. In the meantime, Australians
  are likely to continue to feel under pressure. Notes CPI and WPI were indexed
  to 100 in December 2019. Weekly earnings are the seasonally adjusted “all
  employees average weekly total earnings” from the ABS, indexed to 100 in
  November 2019, then with “missing” quarterly values between the biannual
  figures interpolated linearly. The living cost index is the employee living
  cost index from the ABS Selected Living Cost Indexes publication, indexed to
  100 in December 2019.
