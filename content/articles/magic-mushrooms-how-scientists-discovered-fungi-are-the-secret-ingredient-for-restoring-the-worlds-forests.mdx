  Even in midsummer, the ancient hazelwoods on the Hebridean island of Seil are
  cool and quiet. Countless slanted stems of hazel support a thick canopy, which
  blots out the sun and blankets everything below in a sort of “fairytale
  darkness”, says Bethan Manley, a biologist at the Society for the Protection
  of Underground Networks (Spun). Moss and lichen coat branches threaded with
  honeysuckle, forming a great dome above you, adds David Satori, a researcher
  at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. This rich forest, on Scotland’s Hebridean
  islands, is a remnant of one of Britain’s oldest woodland environments. When
  the last ice age ended, the mile-thick glacier that had buried northern Europe
  melted away and hazelnuts sprouted across the rock left behind. Scientists can
  date when those forests sprang up across the west coast of Britain and
  Ireland, says Satori, because “about 10,000 years ago, you have a massive
  spike in hazel pollen”. Scottish lichenologists have estimated these
  particular woodlands might have been around since 7,500BC. “That’s older than
  any pine forest [in the UK]. Older than any ancient oakwood that we have down
  south,” Satori says. “One of the oldest woodlands in the British Isles.”
  Today, only a few tiny patches of old growth remain. Satori and Manley have
  come to this 49-hectare (121-acre) woodland reserve, the Ballachuan Hazelwood,
  to find the country’s best example. From the outside, the bush-like stand
  appears so unremarkable that you could walk right past and miss it. Their
  target within the woodland is even less conspicuous, hinted at by dead
  branches that hang eerily from the trees and what Satori describes as “stubby
  orange finger-like structures that grip hazel branches”. These ancient woods
  are home to peculiar fungi, including the glue crust fungus that sticks
  together hazel branches, and the parasitic “hazel gloves” that grow out of
  them. Here, the researchers aim to understand how fungal communities could be
  key to regrowing Britain’s lost hazelwoods, one part of a global mission to
  map the forgotten subterranean half of our planet’s forests. In the last few
  years, Britain has tentatively begun to embrace its status as a nation of
  rainforests. Its woodlands, which spend much of the year blanketed in mist or
  rain, are a distinct form of temperate rainforest, one that survives only in
  western Scotland. After the success of Guy Shrubsole’s bestselling The Lost
  Rainforests of Britain, the UK government announced plans to restore the
  nation’s rainforests, which have dwindled to less than 1% of land in Great
  Britain. New research led by Leeds University shows the UK could play a
  globally significant role in reversing the decline of these rainforests.
  Temperate rainforests are a rare ecosystem that covers less than 1% of the
  Earth’s land, restricted to cool, moist conditions that are easily affected by
  climate change. Planet-wide, about two-thirds of temperate rainforests could
  be lost as weather patterns shift, according to that research – with some
  nations, such as Austria, losing 90%. But the UK and Ireland have large
  expanses of unforested and rainy land, meaning these two countries have an
  opportunity to become “global leaders in restoration and reforestation of
  temperate rainforest,” the authors write. Forests’ ability to regrow, however,
  is strongly dependent on the communities of mycorrhizal fungi that grow
  symbiotically with roots, allowing the fungi and tree to exchange nutrients.
  Although mycorrhizal fungi have seen huge declines across Europe, being
  planted in native soil microbiome with healthy fungi can stimulate the growth
  of trees and other plants by 64%, research has shown. The first problem for
  hazelwood rainforests, as well as many rare forests across the planet, is that
  no one knows what this subterranean ecology involves, says Satori. “Hardly
  anything has been done to understand these communities,” he says. About
  three-quarters of fungi are “dark taxa” – species known only by their DNA
  sequence, as physical specimens have not been found. Over the next two years,
  Satori will be documenting soil fungi at Ballachuan and more than 20 other
  sites to establish the first ever map of mycorrhizal communities across
  Britain’s temperate rainforest zones. Today, he is driving a metal coring
  device down into the soil around the hazel’s roots. It pulls out root tips, to
  see what is associating with the hazel, while also sampling soil environmental
  DNA. This “eDNA” can give a broad picture of the range of fungi that are down
  there, which play different roles in the ecosystem. Satori’s work is supported
  by the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (Spun), a research
  organisation founded in 2021 to analyse mycorrhizal fungal communities and
  advocate for their protection. The sampling work in Seil links Scotland’s
  chill forests to similarly endangered, yet very different, rainforests in
  Colombia and Palmyra island, the Earth’s most remote atoll. At each of the
  research sites, the below-ground microbiome – which the organisation calls the
  “circulatory system of the planet” – is being probed to produce a global map,
  which was recently published in the journal Nature. In the richly biodiverse
  Magdalena River valley in Colombia, they are testing areas of rainforest
  cleared for cattle ranching, to see whether these fields still have similar
  fungal microbiomes as areas of untouched primary rainforest, or have flipped
  into new states. In areas now abandoned by farmers, Spun is monitoring to see
  if places that are rich in forest fungi naturally regrow better –and produce a
  map of the fungi-rich locations that may be best for replanting. The challenge
  in the UK is in some ways more extreme than Colombia, says Manley. While much
  of the Colombian farmland was cleared in recent decades, “in some areas of
  Scotland you haven’t had forests for maybe 1,000 years,” she says, potentially
  leaving trees with little fungal life to support them, making them more
  vulnerable to drought and other stresses. Across the British Isles, a number
  of efforts to restore rainforests are now under way. At Bowden Pillars, a
  30-hectare “rainforest creation” site in Totnes, the Devon Wildlife Trust
  (DWT) commissioned soil analysis to help to understand the impact of
  historical use of the site has had on the land, says Claire Inglis, nature
  reserve officer at DWT. Although volunteers have already planted more than
  2,500 trees, the project aims first and foremost to design ways that seeds and
  fungi can spread naturally, as “natural colonisation is always your most
  resilient option for future woodland,” says Inglis, adding that they were
  still only beginning to understand how to restore fungal communities. More
  hands-on measures have been considered by the DWT and the National Trust,
  which is restoring rainforest in north Devon. These include soil restoration
  by “inoculation”, either by adding scoops of soil from intact ecosystems when
  trees are planted or by transplanting fungal spores. Felicity Roos, a soil
  consultant at the National Trust, says: “In the right circumstances, restoring
  degraded landscapes and soils, inoculants can play an important role in
  restoration.” Commercial biofertilisers claiming to contain mycorrhizal spores
  are now a business worth billions, but scientific studies have shown the
  majority of products contain dead or ineffective spores, with some also
  containing pathogens, or disease-causing micro-organisms. Such restoration
  projects underscore the importance of preserving remnants such as Ballachuan,
  and other reserves or fragments of rainforest around the world. These ancient
  patches act as “refugia”: reservoirs of fungi that can then act as a source to
  spread across the patchwork of different habitat types – farmland, developed
  land, semi-natural wild land – that surround it. Much of the UK’s temperate
  rainforest is fragmented into these small pieces on land belonging to
  different farmers and estates. Satori says restoration will require
  reconnecting these across the whole landscape so as to have bridges that allow
  not just fungi but animals and insects to travel across the land. “Having
  these interconnected landscapes is definitely going to be the best way to move
  forward,” he says. “It’s very much a long-term vision.” • This article was

  Manley’s former role at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, rather than her current
  position at the Society for the Protection of Underground Networks.
