  Not too many players are capable of upstaging Mohamed Salah but, last month,
  Alexander Isak revelled in revealing that rare ability. Salah had assumed
  centre stage at Manchester’s Opera House and, as the latest recipient of the
  Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year award, was preparing
  to deliver an eagerly awaited acceptance speech when he lost a previously rapt
  audience. Numerous discreet vibrations from phones switched to silent had
  transmitted the news of Isak posting a particularly provocative Instagram
  message. In accusing Newcastle of breaking promises and leaving a relationship
  severed, it reduced even Liverpool’s Egypt forward to a mere warm-up act
  before the night’s main event. Isak has always possessed the knack of timing
  his runs to perfection and now the Sweden striker had picked precisely the
  right, high-profile moment to pave the final stretch of an albeit still
  arduous path towards joining Salah at Anfield. His Instagram message certainly
  blindsided St James’ Park executives while virtually extinguishing
  increasingly faint hopes that a player then refusing to either train with or
  play for Newcastle could somehow be “reintegrated” into Eddie Howe’s squad.
  Rather like a centre-half panicking in the face of one of Isak’s penalty-area
  advances, Newcastle’s majority owners, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund,
  lunged in with a bullish statement of their own insisting that their £63m
  signing from Real Sociedad three years ago was going nowhere. There were
  briefings that Isak’s social media-powered hand grenade had blown up in his
  face but they would ultimately prove wide of the mark. Behind the public
  intransigence reflecting their own desperation to save face, Newcastle knew
  that the endgame of a long-running saga was under way. It all started when, in
  the spring of 2024, the former minority owner Amanda Staveley informed Isak he
  would be awarded an enhanced contract that summer. Then in the June, Staveley
  lost an internal power struggle with Newcastle’s now outgoing chief executive,
  Darren Eales, and was ousted by the Saudis. The upset extended to Howe and his
  players. Staveley’s communication skills were so strong and her emotional
  intelligence so high that friends speak of the financier’s uncanny ability to
  persuade initially sceptical footballers that Newcastle is England’s finest
  city. Howe does not dispense trust easily but he knew he could rely on a woman
  whose in-depth knowledge of the Arab world and its distinctive business
  culture enabled her to understand PIF’s thinking in a way others could not.
  Her exit coincided with the arrival of the more abrasive Paul Mitchell as
  Newcastle’s sporting director. He would stay less than a year but one of his
  first acts was persuading Yasir al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s Riyadh‑based chair,
  to revoke the decision to improve Isak’s £140,000 a week contract. No matter
  that he had four years left on his current deal and Newcastle were struggling
  to avoid breaching Premier League spending rules, the striker was
  incandescent. Howe would later speak repeatedly of a “very difficult” summer
  and an “unsettled” dressing room as Newcastle opened last season slowly, with
  Isak scoring once in the opening seven games. That he ended it having scored
  27 times in all competitions as Newcastle won the Carabao Cup and qualified
  for the Champions League speaks volumes for the manager’s soft leadership
  skills. It was, however, noticeable that Isak’s form dipped after the cup
  triumph. Howe has rebutted claims he told him he could leave this summer but
  it is understood a June training ground meeting involving the striker, his
  representatives and the manager ended badly. By now the Saudis were happy to
  improve his contract but the Swede wanted more than the £200,000 weekly wage
  on offer and his desire to join Liverpool was highlighted during a difficult
  training camp near Salzburg in early July. Divisions were understood to be
  drawn between players critical of the 25-year-old and sympathetic friends
  including Sven Botman and Joe Willock. Howe has since said squad morale is now
  “very strong” but the first two weeks of pre-season training were tricky.
  Perhaps coincidentally that was the fortnight Isak spent with Newcastle before
  dodging Newcastle’s summer tour to Singapore and South Korea and working out
  alone in Spain for a week without managerial permission. After returning, Isak
  declined all Howe’s offers of reintegration, was told to stay away from a club
  bonding barbecue and trained in isolation from his teammates, kicking balls
  repeatedly into empty goals and against a rebound wall. Privately, Newcastle’s
  determination to retain Isak was softening. The only problem was that with a
  series of strikers including Hugo Ekitiké and Benjamin Sesko rejecting moves
  to St James’ they could not find a suitable replacement, let alone the desired
  two. Moreover the Saudis regarded Liverpool’s initial £110m offer for Isak as
  an insult. Fast forward to late last Monday afternoon back in Darras Hall, an
  affluent Northumberland enclave, eight miles north-west of the city where a
  Saudi delegation joined Newcastle’s minority owner Jamie Reuben on a visit to
  a property hidden behind the high hedges and opaque security gates that
  characterise north-east England’s wealthiest neighbourhood. Inside the house
  Isak and his representatives, most notably his uncompromising Serbian adviser,
  Vlado Lemic, informed their guests he had no intention of wearing black and
  white stripes again. Within 45 minutes Reuben and co were driving back to St
  James’ Park where Howe’s team lost 3-2 against Liverpool later that bank
  holiday Monday evening. At that point the manager had not spoken to his
  supposed star striker for almost a fortnight and was reiterating that he “only
  wanted” players “fully committed to Newcastle”. It finally proved the cue for
  Rumayyan, making a rare trip to Tyneside, to sanction a successful £70m move
  for Stuttgart’s Germany striker Nick Woltemade. By Saturday evening Howe
  diplomatically refused to deny reports from Sweden that Isak had already bid
  his former teammates farewell. The longest, and messiest, of goodbyes was
  almost over, leaving the Saudis stung by suggestions that even Newcastle’s
  former and unlamented owner Mike Ashley would have handled things infinitely
  better.
