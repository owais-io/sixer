  It’s usually a bad sign if you’re wondering what the heck is going on in a
  drama when you’re two episodes in, but there is an exception: you can happily
  ride on if you sense that, although you don’t know what it’s doing, the show
  definitely does. Such is the bristling, bewildering, overpoweringly confident
  aura of Alien: Earth, a new TV take on cinema’s greatest sci-fi horror
  franchise by writer-director Noah Hawley of Fargo fame. We are in the year
  2120, just the right setting for a show that plays on our fears that our
  grandchildren and great-grandchildren are going to live in hell. Simple
  green-on-black text, styled like a computer readout from the 80s, informs us
  that, in this broken future, corporations have taken over the universe, and
  which one achieves total domination will be determined by which of three
  technologies wins a “race for immortality”: cyborgs (enhanced humans), synths
  (wholly artificial beings) or hybrids (synthetic bodies with human
  consciousnesses implanted). The last of these is our primary concern in a
  first episode that mostly consigns the flesh-ripping aliens to flash-forwards
  so rapid they are almost subliminal. In Neverland, the laboratory complex of
  trillion-dollar disruptive startup Prodigy, a girl who looks to be in the last
  stages of terminal cancer lies down next to an inert adult figure she names
  Wendy. When the procedure is over, her brain has been copied from her ailing
  body and pasted into the entirely lifelike synthetic woman. The newly alive
  Wendy (Sydney Chandler) is the first hybrid and, soon, the leader of a gang of
  child-robot soldiers mentored by the enigmatic Kirsh, played by Timothy
  Olyphant sporting harrowing bleach-blond hair, an unnerving murmur and a
  turtleneck sweater that says something really isn’t right here. Up in space,
  meanwhile, a crew of humans have signed up for a job with big workers’ rights
  issues. If being managed by a humourless cyborg named Morrow (Babou Ceesay)
  wasn’t appalling enough, their cargo of captured alien life-forms are about to
  break out of the laughably weak glass containers they’ve been stored in, kill
  everyone except the self-preserving Morrow, and cause the spaceship to crash
  as Morrow grimly tries to fulfil his obligation to the super-rich
  Weyland-Yutani Corporation by returning the bounty to Earth. As the ship
  mingles with the rubble of the tall urban Earth building it has ploughed into
  and a Prodigy search-and-rescue (-and-steal-anything-valuable) team descends,
  led by Alex Lawther as listless medic (and Wendy’s long-lost brother!) Hermit,
  the monsters are finally on the loose. The setup is loose compared with most
  of the Alien movies, since the human and humanoid protagonists aren’t confined
  with the creatures in a tin box surrounded by an endless, scream-proof void,
  so Alien: Earth has to find other ways to create bone-deep dread. Most
  obviously we have the aliens, who aren’t yet particularly innovative but are
  suitably awesome, from a scuttling, leechlike bug to an eyeball with many,
  many legs and a shiny xenomorph that comes over as a little more man-like than
  its previous incarnations. They’re the classic nightmare fuel updated and
  sharpened and, when they strike, they leave behind the sort of oddly beautiful
  tableaux of torn corpses we haven’t seen since Hannibal. Even better is the
  casting, with Lawther bringing the same blank resignation he lent to The End
  of the F***ing World, and Chandler offsetting it with a disturbing blend of
  naivety and concealed power. In an obvious allegory for the rise of AI, the
  hybrid Wendy has been given abilities beyond what even her creators
  understand. Most pleasing to see is Samuel Blenkin, rewarded for his fantastic
  supporting turn as the resentful weakling Prince Charles in Mary &amp; George
  with the key role of Boy Kavalier, the “genius” CEO of Prodigy and the
  Neverland project. With his comfy robes and puppyish, young-Wonka bounce, he
  is the frighteningly influential tech-bro pseudo-visionary who might bring the
  whole world crashing down, essentially just for a laugh: one of many nice
  touches in Blenkin’s performance is the way the Boy takes a crucial video call
  by lying on a bed and gripping a tablet between his raised bare feet. What
  Alien: Earth lacks in its opening two instalments is a propulsive, linear
  narrative or clarity of thematic vision, to the point where it sometimes
  approaches Westworld levels of making us ask the gloomy screen what in the
  blazes is happening. But whether it’s a padded corridor filmed at a 10-degree
  angle, a landscape of jagged concrete and raining sparks, a wriggling
  creepy-crawly from space or just the look in someone’s jaded eye, the series
  always has a way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Something
  gloriously horrific is just around the corner. • Alien: Earth is on Disney+
  now.
