  Live coverage of the Premier League clash between Manchester City and
  Tottenham on Saturday is set to break audiences records one week after the
  competition’s debut on Australian commercial television, drawing it inside the
  tent at Channel Nine and helping overcome what has been described as the
  country’s “petty conflict” between football codes. Last week’s Aston Villa v
  Newcastle match reached close to 900,000 viewers in the Premier League’s debut
  on one of Australia’s commercial television channels, after Optus Sport handed
  over the rights to Nine and its streaming subsidiary Stan Sport in the
  off-season. The match out-rated Seven’s evening movie blockbuster The Martian
  and was within 300,000 viewers of the NRL clash between the Rabbitohs and Eels
  beforehand. The live audience on Stan was also the largest for any football
  broadcast on the platform, which has welcomed former Optus customers since the
  rights changed hands in the off-season. After years of the Premier League
  appearing on subscription platforms and public broadcasters ABC and SBS, the
  response highlights how the move to the Nine conglomerate has taken football
  to a broader audience. While the sport’s major events such as the Women’s
  World Cup have performed spectacularly on Australian commercial television,
  club competitions have struggled to secure prime-time windows on main linear
  channels. This year’s A-League Men grand final in March reached 815,000
  viewers on Channel 10, with its slightly higher average than last Saturday’s
  Premier League match aided by an earlier time slot. Former Premier League and
  Socceroos goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, who is part of the Nine/Stan local
  broadcast team, appeared on the NRL coverage that preceded the Aston Villa
  game last week to promote the coverage. He said he recognises a “resurgence”
  in interest in the competition. “It’s exponentially grown, and that has
  happened over the years, but I think the ‘resurgence’-feel that we can sense
  is because of the visibility,” he said. Bosnich will again feature in a
  promotion during Nine’s NRL coverage on Saturday, but this time live from
  Melbourne’s Federation Square, where Stan has organised a watch party for the
  City v Spurs match which will immediately follow the NRL. Some voices in rugby
  league media have criticised the decision by Nine to prioritise live Premier
  League over an NRL post-game show, with the Daily Telegraph describing it as a
  “snub”. However, Bosnich said being part of the Nine group has meant he is
  often promoting other sports, and Australian sports fans typically have
  cross-code interests. “When I’ve been in this country I’ve always thought that
  sometimes it’s OK to have competition with other sports, but I think sometimes
  it’s turned into petty conflict, which I don’t like, because I’m a great sport
  lover and I know the majority of Australians are as well,” he said. This
  Saturday’s game is expected to outperform week one given the interest in title
  contenders City and Spurs, the club which sacked Australian coach Ange
  Postecoglou in June. The programming decisions reflect Nine’s strategy to use
  the reach of its free-to-air channels to drive Stan Sport subscriptions by
  targeting general sports fans. Nine is also screening the Wallaroos’ opening
  World Cup match this Saturday, which overlaps with the end of the NRL coverage
  and the start of the Premier League, on both Gem and Stan Sport. And it has
  committed to showing next week’s Chelsea v Fulham contest on free-to-air,
  which will follow the North Queensland v Brisbane NRL clash. More games could
  also find their way onto Channel Nine before clocks change due to daylight
  savings and matches are pushed later than the current 9:30pm kick-off time in
  the eastern states. This season’s competition is then likely to go behind the
  Stan paywall, though Nine has screened Champions League and Europa League
  finals in recent years. If Nine persists with Premier League programming until
  daylight savings, the network could use the Wallabies’ Bledisloe Cup clash
  with the All Blacks on 4 October as a lead-in to the game between two of
  Australia’s more popular English teams, Leeds and Spurs, which would create a
  combination of two of Stan Sport’s most prominent sports properties. Nine is
  seeking to secure all of the rights to the NRL in its next broadcast cycle
  from 2028 – rather than partner with another subscription platform such as Fox
  Sports – and use Stan to leverage its free-to-air coverage. Its managing
  director of streaming and broadcast, Amanda Laing, started at Nine in April
  after spending more than six years at Foxtel.
