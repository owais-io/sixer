  Penrith Panthers have defended the actions of trainer Corey Bocking after the
  NRL proposed huge penalties for a controversial incident at the climax of
  Saturday’s clash against the Gold Coast. Bocking ran in front of Titans
  halfback Jayden Campbell during the kicker’s preparations for a conversion
  attempt which would have made the Titans’ lead four points with less than
  seven minutes to go. Campbell’s ensuing miss left the door open for a late
  two-point drop goal from Nathan Cleary to send the game to golden point. The
  Panthers finished 30-26 winners. The NRL issued a breach notice to the
  Panthers on Monday, proposing to suspend Bocking for five matches and
  demanding the club pay a $50,000 fine. The club has five days to formally
  respond, but issued a statement on Monday seeking to explain Bocking’s error.
  “The club is adamant that the actions of the trainer were an honest mistake
  and there was no intent to breach the rules or gain an advantage. The trainer
  immediately apologised upon realising the error,” it said. “The circumstances
  involved a late change and in-the-moment confusion, but we understand that
  does not excuse the outcome.” The NRL alleges Bocking “unnecessarily
  interfered with and distracted” Campbell as he was attempting a conversion
  kick in breach of the NRL operations manual and code of conduct. It also noted
  the proposed penalty “takes into account previous breaches by Penrith Panthers
  trainers”. Another Panthers trainer was banned for a week in May after
  squirting a ball with water during a match. Panthers coach Ivan Cleary said
  after the game it was an “honest mistake” and both Bocking and club had
  apologised. “He’s just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Cleary said,
  explaining he had just changed his mind on an interchange and Bocking was
  involved in the confusion. Titans coach Des Hasler said he had to be “careful”
  about his choice of words, but ultimately said the incident probably didn’t
  cost his side the game. Bocking will miss the rest of the regular season if
  the club accepts the breach notice as the Panthers chase a place in the top
  four in their bid for a fifth-straight premiership. Meanwhile, players from
  Wests Tigers, who surprised Canterbury-Bankstown on Sunday in a 28-14 upset,
  are also being investigated by the NRL after they made hand gestures
  considered offensive in Arab cultures after scoring a second half try. 17% of
  the population of the Bankstown area has a Lebanese background according to
  the 2021 ABS Census, and the club hosts an Iftar event with fans each year.
