  A maths lecturer, convinced his wife is cheating, will not check the CCTV
  footage that might confirm his fears but instead keeps a private tally of the
  number of pubic hairs she sheds in her underwear. One hair is “OK,
  acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says,
  unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from
  the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker
  to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of
  religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A
  troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals
  large sums of money that she will never spend. In Love’s Labour, the
  London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to
  the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows
  and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard
  ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac
  tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I
  never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking,
  collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and
  motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie
  beneath. Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013
  debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like
  Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details
  have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others
  will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish),
  makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s
  belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly –
  which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life. The book is
  as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our
  hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument
  between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora,
  has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never
  learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally,
  accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to
  one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz
  concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be
  the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their
  autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand
  themselves. As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after
  Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the
  origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or
  emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a
  tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new
  understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been
  working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance
  encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his
  understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure
  horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who
  has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s
  suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream
  that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of
  her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will
  haunt readers long after they have set this book aside. “To see the light, you
  have to go down into the dark,” Grosz writes. His patients often learn that
  pain or darkness cannot be avoided: to love fully one must accept the reality
  of loss, to live fully one must accept the reality of death. What a privilege
  it must be to accompany another person so closely as they try to figure out
  the challenge of living – of change and love, and accepting love and change.
  And what a privilege it is for the reader to catch a glimpse of this process.
