  BLOOMING MARVELLOUS Despite the Scottish Premiership title race being more
  predictable than Football Daily at a bottomless brunch, fitba has never been
  short of drama. Who can forget Ross County deleting their own website, Kirk
  Broadfoot suffering facial burns after microwaving an egg and former Hearts
  manager Robbie Neilson trying to give journalists the slip as he left the
  club’s training ground by sending out a decoy (sports scientist John Hill) to
  the car park in a Robbie Neilson mask. Edinburgh, very much the second city in
  Scotland when it comes to football, still has one of the game’s finest
  rivalries between two grand old clubs, Hearts and Hibernian. Each have had
  their moments in recent derbies: last year Hearts’ Lawrence Shankland
  celebrated scoring a penalty by catching and eating a pie thrown by a Hibs
  supporter. In March, Jack Iredale scored a screamer to win the derby for Hibs.
  The post-match celebrations at Easter Road featured one of the finest ever
  renditions of Sunshine on Leith, a song sung with so much feeling that it left
  some Hibs players in tears. And who can blame them? If you get goosebumps
  watching that song, imagine what it must be like to come from that corner of
  Scotland, stand on that terrace and sing those lyrics in front of your
  victorious team. Magic. The point is, fitba is far greater than just Rangers
  and Celtic. And this is very much the opinion of Tony Bloom, the owner of
  Brighton who bought a 29% stake in Hearts this summer for £9.86m. Following
  the club’s opening win over Aberdeen – a 2-0 victory that leaves the Jambos
  top of the Premiership table – Bloom was in a bullish mood as he faced the
  media, explaining that he thinks Hearts can challenge for glory. “If we have
  not won the league title in the next 10 years, I will be very disappointed,”
  Bloom stated. “I want to make sure that we are in the talk to win the title at
  the start of each season.” We have heard this sort of patter before, a new
  owner coming in and telling a club’s supporters what they want to hear. The
  difference is, Bloom has a track record of using his army of data nerds and
  analytics gurus to drastically improve clubs with savvy recruitment. Brighton
  are now one of the best run clubs in England, while Union Saint-Gilloise, who
  were bottom of Belgium’s second tier when the Englishman took over in 2018,
  won the Belgian top flight a few months ago for the first time in 90 years and
  are in Bigger Cup. The last time a club that wasn’t called Celtic or Rangers
  won the Scottish Premiership was 1985 and the last time Hearts won it was 65
  years ago, but Bloom seems untroubled. “I understand there will be a lot of
  Celtic and Rangers fans, maybe Hibs and Aberdeen fans, who will be laughing
  and saying ‘we’ve heard it all before’,” he blathered. “I just thought there
  was an opportunity here to shake things up in Scotland. I think we’ve got a
  very good chance of at least being second this season. I’ve just got a lot
  more confidence of what Hearts can do compared to when I did my first press
  conference at Union seven years ago.” Bloom has wasted no time in bringing in
  a new striker, Cláudio Braga, who (very much in the Brighton ilk) was signed
  from Norwegian second-division side FK Aalesunds for around £400,000. The
  Portuguese bagged four goals in five pre-season matches – including one in a
  3-0 win over Premier League Sunderland – and already has a chant among the
  Tynecastle faithful: “All we need is … Cláudio Braga,” set to the tune of the
  Queen classic. Sunshine on Leith it is not, but Hearts fans will be getting
  goosebumps regardless. QUOTE OF THE DAY A couple of friends had come over to
  see me, we were chatting, and suddenly they said they couldn’t understand what
  I was saying. My speech was slurring. I had gone for a walk that morning and
  felt wobbly, just very lethargic. I was sapped of any energy and a couple of
  times I felt as though I might stumble but I didn’t” – in an extract from a
  new book, the former Portsmouth, Leeds and Exeter defender Noel Blake talks
  about the emotional and physical battle of recovering from a stroke. FOOTBALL
  DAILY LETTERS Celta Vigo signing Athletic Bilbao youngster Luis Bilbao and
  signing Bryan Zaragoza are yet more disappointing nails in coffin of
  nominative determinism. Now, it’s just me and a lad I knew at school called
  Gareth Thickett who failed all his exams that are keeping up the good fight …”
