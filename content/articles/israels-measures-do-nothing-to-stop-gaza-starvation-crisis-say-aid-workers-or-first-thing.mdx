  Good morning. Aid workers have said Israel’s new measures – meant to improve
  the humanitarian situation in Gaza – fall far short of what is needed and aid
  access continues to be blocked amid the population’s spiralling famine. The
  new measures, which came into effect on Sunday and include daily humanitarian
  pauses, as well as airdropped aid and humanitarian corridors for UN aid
  trucks, were announced by Israel as international pressure mounted to
  alleviate the hunger crisis. Aid groups have said Israel’s blockade of
  humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip is the principal cause of the starvation
  crisis, in which 151 Palestinians have died of hunger, more than half of whom
  died in the past month alone. While the crisis has deepened, Israel’s military
  has continued its attacks, killing at least 48 people seeking aid in Gaza on
  Wednesday, according to the territory’s ministry of health. Meanwhile, the
  Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, said the country would also formally
  recognize Palestine during the UN general assembly in September, after France
  and 14 other countries co-signed a declaration. How much aid is now needed?
  The number of aid trucks that have been entering Gaza since the new measures
  were announced has increased, with more than 200 trucks entering on Tuesday,
  according to Israeli customs authority (Cogat). But it falls far below the
  500-600 trucks the UN has said is necessary to sustain the 2 million residents
  of Gaza. Kamala Harris announces she will not run for governor of California
  Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential
  nominee, announced on Wednesday that she would not run for governor of
  California – a highly anticipated decision that leaves the contest to lead the
  country’s largest blue state wide open. Harris, 60, who previously served as
  California’s attorney general and US senator, had been exploring a run for the
  state’s top job since leaving the White House in January. The decision does
  not rule out a future run for public office, including a third bid for the
  White House, after unsuccessful campaigns in 2020 and 2024. What did Harris
  say? “I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the
  privilege to serve as their governor. … But after deep reflection, I’ve
  decided that I will not run for governor in this election.” Donald Trump has
  been accused of launching “a direct attack on Brazilian democracy”, after the
  US treasury imposed sanctions on Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian supreme
  court judge widely credited with helping save the country’s democracy from a
  2022 rightwing coup. The move was announced on Wednesday by the treasury
  secretary, Scott Bessent, before Trump hit Brazilian imports with 50% tariffs
  by signing an executive order “to deal with the recent policies, practices,
  and actions by the government of Brazil”. What’s the context? Hundreds of
  supporters of the former president Jair Bolsonaro have been put on trial and
  jailed for taking part in the 8 January 2023 rightwing riots in the capital,
  Brasília, during which the supreme court, congress and presidential palace
  were stormed and ransacked. And what did Bessent say? He accused Moraes of
  being “responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary
  detentions that violate human rights and politicized prosecutions – including
  against former president Jair Bolsonaro”. In other news … The Trump
  administration has reportedly frozen $108m in federal research funding to Duke
  University over its affirmative action policies. Meanwhile, Brown University
  announced on Wednesday it struck a deal with the administration over
  admissions policies to restore $50m in funding. A UK high court judge ruled
  that a co-founder of the proscribed group Palestine Action can pursue a legal
  challenge, following the group being banned by the home secretary under
  anti-terrorism laws. Stat of the day: Supersized stick insect discovered in
  Australia A newly discovered stick insect that weighs slightly less than a
  golf ball may be the heaviest insect in Australia, scientists say. The
  40cm-long new species, named Acrophylla alta, was found in the high altitudes
  of the Atherton tablelands in north Queensland – and scientists said the
  habitat could be part of the reason for its large size. Don’t miss this: The
  return of the spoof – can comedy’s silliest subgenre make a comeback? The
  Naked Gun returns this weekend, heralding the potential return of the spoof –
  a comedic subgenre with astonishing versatility, writes Jesse Hassenger. In a
  period when a pure comedy hasn’t crossed the $100m mark in the US in almost a
  decade, The Naked Gun could be leading a spoof revival, with This Is Spinal
  Tap, Scary Movie and Spaceballs all upcoming. Climate check: Countries failing
  to act on UN climate pledge to triple renewables, climate thinktank finds Most
  global governments have failed to act on the 2023 UN pledge to triple the
  world’s renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade, according to the
  climate thinktank Ember. Only 22 countries of 130 have increased their
  renewable energy ambitions since signing a renewables pact at the Cop28
  climate talks. Countries failing to act include the US, China and Russia. Last
  Thing: Fans line streets of Birmingham in UK to say farewell to Ozzy Osbourne
  Thousands of fans lined the streets of Birmingham in the UK to watch Ozzy
  Osbourne make his final journey through his home city, as crowds chanted the
  late Black Sabbath singer’s name. He died last week, aged 76, 17 days after
  playing his final concert. In an interview in 2011, Osbourne said he wanted
  his eventual funeral to be “a celebration, not a mope-fest”. Sign up First
