  Israel’s destruction of Gaza has left starving Palestinians with access to
  only 1.5% of cropland that is accessible and suitable for cultivation,
  according to new figures from the UN. This is down from 4% in April, according
  to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), suggesting Israel has
  continued to target Palestinian farmland since initiating a complete blockade
  in early March, severely restricting aid from entering the Gaza Strip, where 2
  million starved people are trapped. Before the conflict, Gaza was a thriving
  agricultural hub, where farmers and ordinary Palestinians cultivated a wide
  variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains for local consumption.
  According to the FAO, agriculture accounted for around 10% of the Gaza Strip’s
  economy, and more than 560,000 people, or a quarter of the population, were at
  least partially supported by agriculture and fishing. Israel has targeted food
  sources – orchards, greenhouses, farmland and fishers – since the beginning of
  its siege on Gaza in October 2023. By 28 July 2025, Israel had damaged 86%,
  the equivalent of almost 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres), of farmland in the
  Gaza Strip – up from 81% in April, the FAO said. While just under 9% of
  cropland is still physically accessible, only 1.5% – the equivalent of 232
  hectares – is both accessible and not damaged by the Israeli offensive. “Gaza
  is now on the brink of a full-scale famine. People are starving not because
  food is unavailable, but because access is blocked, local agrifood systems
  have collapsed, and families can no longer sustain even the most basic
  livelihoods,” said FAO director-general Qu Dongyu. “We urgently need safe and
  sustained humanitarian access and immediate support to restore local food
  production and livelihoods – this is the only way to prevent further loss of
  life. The right to food is a basic human right.” In northern Gaza, Israeli
  tanks and bombs have destroyed or damaged 94% of what was among the most
  fertile, productive land in the territory, and Palestinians have no access to
  the remaining 6% of their cropland. In Rafah, near the Egypt border, 79% is
  flattened and the rest has been blocked as part of Israel’s so-called military
  corridor. Last week, Israeli forces partially demolished a seed bank in
  Hebron, in the West Bank, destroying tools and equipments used to used to
  reproduce heirloom seeds. UN experts, agencies and aid groups have been
  warning since early 2024 that Israel is orchestrating a campaign of deliberate
  mass starvation in Gaza by systematically destroying local food production and
  blocking aid, in violation of international law. Hundreds of Palestinians have
  now starved to death, and thousands more have been killed trying to access
  food aid. Earlier this week, Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the
  right to food, told the Guardian: “Israel has built the most efficient
  starvation machine you can imagine. So while it’s always shocking to see
  people being starved, no one should act surprised. All the information has
  been out in the open since early 2024.” • This article’s main image was
