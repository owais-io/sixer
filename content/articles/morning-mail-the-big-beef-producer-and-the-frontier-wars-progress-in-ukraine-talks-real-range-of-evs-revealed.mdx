  Good morning. We continue our Descendants series with revelations of
  Australia’s biggest beef producer’s historical links to abuses against
  Aboriginal people – through the actions of its longest-serving superintendent
  before he joined the company, and others who helped establish its farming
  operations in the 19th century. With all eyes on Moscow as Donald Trump’s
  deadline for Russia to agree to peace with Ukraine looms large, US officials
  have met with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. An academic is crying foul after
  the University of Sydney removed a Palestinian flag flying from his office
  window. And: a new study finds the real-world range of EVs doesn’t match
  manufacturers’ claims. Australia ‘Chilling effect on free speech’ | The
  University of Sydney has removed a Palestinian flag hanging outside an
  academic’s office after claiming it breached a new policy regarding flags. The
  Descendants | The Australian Agricultural Company, or AACo, is worth about
  $830m as Australia’s largest beef producer, but investigations have uncovered
  the company’s historical links with the dispossession, shooting and poisoning
  of Aboriginal people through the exploits of Jesse Gregson and others who
  helped establish its operations. CSIRO cuts | Hundreds more jobs could be axed
  at Australia’s national science agency, sparking concerns the country is
  gutting its research capability. Electric vehicles | A government-funded
  program to test the true performance of vehicles has found the driving range
  of five popular electric cars is between 5% and 23% lower than results from
  laboratory testing. ‘No clear explanation’ | Since July many Meta users have
  reported accounts being suspended erroneously – and Australian businesses are
  now struggling. A personal platypus | British wartime PM Winston Churchill was
  due to receive a monotreme named after him but it mysteriously died en route.
  German U-boats were blamed – but was that the truth? World Russia-Ukraine war
  | Donald Trump said “everyone agrees this war must come to a close” after US
  envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin as the deadline to
  end Russia’s war against Ukraine looms. Gaza crisis | Israel has issued forced
  displacement orders for Gaza City and Khan Younis amid fears of full
  occupation in Gaza. Our exclusive story reveals Israel relies on Microsoft’s
  cloud services for expansive surveillance of Palestinians. Plus: the film
  about a Palestinian photographer killed by missiles in Gaza. Trump tariffs |
  The White House is placing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India,
  bringing total tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation for the country’s purchase of
  oil from Russia. Bolsonaro detained | A Brazilian judge has eased the terms of
  Jair Bolsonaro’s house arrest, allowing the far-right former president to
  receive visits from family. ‘Islamophobic and discriminatory’ | A local
  authority in Spain has banned Muslims from using public facilities such as
  civic centres and gyms to celebrate the religious festivals Eid al-Fitr and
  Eid al-Adha. Full Story Can Trump be shamed into supporting human rights?
  After three decades at the helm of Human Rights Watch, the former executive
  director Kenneth Roth has written a memoir about his time campaigning against
  human rights violations around the world – including in the Palestinian
  occupied territories. He speaks with Nour Haydar about why he thinks there’s
  always a strategy to pressure governments into supporting better human rights
  outcomes. In-depth The US Bureau of Labor Studies released its July employment
  figures last week, and they were not good. In response, Donald Trump did what
  any autocrat would do when told bad news: he shot the messenger – by firing
  the commissioner of labor statistics. In his latest Grogonomics column, Greg
  Jericho argues that Trump’s war on statistics is an authoritarian attack on
  democracy – and countries like Australia should call it out. Not the news The
  Tjanpi Desert Weavers is an Indigenous-run social enterprise that empowers
  women across 350,000 sq km of central Australia to earn an income through
  fibre art. Its contemporary art and sculptural works based in traditional
  practices have been exhibited in Australia – and around the world. Thirty
  years after it all began, Dellaram Vreeland looks at how 400 Indigenous women
  in remote Australia took the art world by storm. Sport AFL | Jayden Nguyen’s
  Bombers debut could herald new era as the AFL tackles cultural diversity, Jack
  Snape writes. Cricket | The Hundred is set for Twenty20 transformation as
  early as next year, with IPL investors keen on a switch. Football | Liverpool
  grant Darwin Núñez the go-ahead for a move to Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal;
  Newcastle’s Alexander Isak ordered to train alone amid transfer speculation.
  Rugby union | Rugby in the US suffers another blow as the second team in a
  week exits Major League Rugby. Media roundup Increasing numbers of older
  Australians are seeking to share houses as property prices continue rising and
  rental costs soar, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Business leaders claim
  Melbourne’s post-Covid recovery is under threat from the state government’s
  plan to enshrine a legal right to work from home, the Age reports. What’s
  happening today NSW | A hearing is scheduled in the NSW supreme court as MP
  Gareth Ward fights parliamentary expulsion. Nationwide | A national student
