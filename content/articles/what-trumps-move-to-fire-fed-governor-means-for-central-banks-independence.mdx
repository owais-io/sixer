  Donald Trump has said he is firing Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, in a
  move viewed as a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over
  the independent institution. Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social
  platform that he is firing Cook because of allegations she committed mortgage
  fraud. The allegation was made last week by Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to
  the Federal Housing Administration, an agency that regulates mortgage giants
  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Cook previously said she would not leave her post.
  Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting
  its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him. Powell, who has
  previously warned that tariffs will push up inflation, told the Jackson Hole
  economic symposium in Wyoming last week that the Fed could soon change its
  policy stance. Powell’s caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed
  cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the
  federal government pays on its debt. Trump has also accused Powell of
  mismanaging the US central bank’s $2.5bn building renovation project. Firing
  the Fed chair or forcing out a governor threatens the Fed’s venerated
  independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street
  investors. Here’s what to know about the Fed: The Fed wields extensive power
  over the US economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls –
  which it typically does when the economy falters – the Fed can make borrowing
  cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it
  raises the rate – which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation – it
  can weaken the economy and cause job losses. Economists have long preferred
  independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to
  fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a
  home, car, or appliance more expensive. The importance of an independent Fed
  was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the
  1970s and early 1980s. Arthur Burns, former Fed chair, has been widely blamed
  for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to
  pressure from Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election.
  Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a
  landslide. Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by
  Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed’s short-term rate to the stunningly high
  level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a
  sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11% and spurred widespread
  protests. Yet Volcker didn’t flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen
  back into the low single digits. Volcker’s willingness to inflict pain on the
  economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of
  the value of an independent Fed. An effort to fire Powell would almost
  certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing
  up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for
  mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt. The interest rate on the 10-year
  treasury is a benchmark for mortgage rates. Most investors prefer an
  independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without
  being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more
  predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter
  interest rate policies if economic conditions changed. If the Fed was more
  swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate –
  or understand – its decisions. The supreme court in a ruling earlier this year
  suggested that a president can’t fire the chair of the Fed just because he
  doesn’t like the chair’s policy choices. But he may be able to remove him “for
  cause”, typically interpreted to mean some kind of wrongdoing or negligence.
  It’s a likely reason the Trump administration has zeroed in on the building
  renovation, in hopes it could provide a “for cause” pretext. Still, Powell
  would likely fight any attempt to remove him, and the case could wind up at
  the supreme court.
