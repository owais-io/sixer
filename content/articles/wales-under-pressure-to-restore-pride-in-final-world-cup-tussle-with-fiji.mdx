  Kayleigh Powell admits that being the only home nation not to have qualified
  for the Rugby World Cup knockout stage has been “gutting”, but the versatile
  back is relishing “one more opportunity to show what Wales is about” against
  Fiji. After losing their opening two matches, Wales have one last chance to
  avoid finishing bottom of the pool on Saturday. Sean Lynn’s side had been
  aiming to reach to the quarter-finals, joining England, Scotland and Ireland,
  but an underwhelming tournament has left them heading for the exit. Wales were
  poor against Scotland with the game expected to be a close encounter but Bryan
  Easson’s side blew them away 38-8. The 42-0 scoreline against Canada did not
  reflect Wales’s bright start, where they defended well and created chances.
  Their record over the two pool games paints a dismal picture: 10 times more
  points conceded than scored, just 13 defenders beaten and, against Canada, a
  lineout success rate of only 45%. There had been expectations of a more
  immediate improvement after Lynn, who won the last three Premiership Women’s
  Rugby titles with Gloucester-Hartpury, took over before the 2025 Women’s Six
  Nations. Under him Wales have played nine games and won just one. Lynn has
  been commendably honest, admitting Wales’s performance against Scotland “was
  not good enough”, but was happy to see some improvements against Canada. If
  Wales can add consistency and finish the tries they set-up, they could beat
  Fiji and have something to build on for the 2026 Six Nations, but no matter
  the result at Sandy Park, Wales will be heading home. “One thing that
  resonates with me is how do we want to be remembered as individuals and as a
  team?” says Powell. “I think for us the main thing is being ruthless and not
  letting teams get away with things easy: giving easy penalties away, skill
  errors at crucial times. In our attacking 22 we need to be coming away with
  points more than we have been. Being clinical and ruthless is how I want to be
  remembered as a team.” Wales face their former coach Ioan Cunningham, who led
  the side for three years, as he guides a physical Fiji team who could yet
  leave Wales winless. Fiji have also drawn a blank at the World Cup after
  losing 65-7 to Canada and 29-15 to Scotland. Coming up against Cunningham is
  not something the squad have been discussing, says Powell. “It’s just a game
  of rugby. The main focus for us is what we do on the pitch, everything off of
  it doesn’t really matter.” While criticisms of Wales’s form are expected,
  personal attacks on social media are not tolerated. The lock Georgia Evans
  this week hit back against those saying her matchday look is not one of a
  “rugby player”. “The bows in my hair, the tape on my arm, the eyelashes and
  full face of make-up that I choose to wear has no bearing on my ability, my
  passion or fight for this game... Don’t worry I won’t be changing,” she said
  in a statement. Wales Rugby Union her andthe players may wear bows in
  solidarity with their teammate against Fiji. The full-back Nel Metcalfe has
  said the online abuse has brought the squad closer together. “I don’t know how
  people can be so cruel,” she said. “I don’t know how they type a message out
  and think that is OK to send to someone. It is not acceptable at all. Women’s
  rugby is such a safe space for everyone to express yourself and show who you
  want to be. It’s massively disappointing. I just hope everyone still keeps
  being themselves, that is what we want. Ignore the hate and keep being you.”
  One positive for Wales has been the 20-year-old Metcalfe, who believes World
  Cup experience will only aid her game: “It’s the biggest World Cup so far, so
  it has been an incredible experience personally. The games might not have gone
  our way but I have learned so much and just being in this environment, the
  media, everything about it, it’s been really good. “There are always massive
  positives. We have tried to move the ball better than I think we have done in
  the past. Physicality is always something we want to improve and keep
  improving. It’s hard to say right now, but when we review we will be able to
  take some positives.” Wales will feel the pressure against Fiji and while a
  win will not save their World Cup campaign, it would restore some pride and
  offer a small platform to build on for 2026.
