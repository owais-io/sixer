  Alexander Isak has made a belated attempt to rebuild bridges at Newcastle by
  thanking his former teammates, St James’ Park staff and the club’s fans for
  their support during his three years on Tyneside. When Isak joined Liverpool
  for £125m on Monday evening the Sweden striker departed a squad and a city
  thoroughly disillusioned by his decision not to train with or play for Eddie
  Howe’s team for the majority of this summer. Ultimately that tactic succeeded
  in forcing the move to Anfield he had long craved but, along the way, a player
  who scored 27 times for Newcastle last season shredded his reputation there.
  In a conciliatory Instagram post that, perhaps tellingly, made no direct
  mention of Howe, Isak wrote: “I want to express my gratitude to my team-mates,
  the staff and, above all, the city of Newcastle and the amazing supporters for
  the three unforgettable years we shared together. Together we have written
  history and brought the club to the place where it truly belongs. It has been
  an honour to be part of the journey – from reaching the Champions League to
  winning the first trophy in over 70 years. Forever grateful. Thank you,
  Newcastle.” As the 25-year-old attempted to burnish his image, Isak’s
  representative, Vlado Lemic, was anything but on-message in a cryptic barb
  quite clearly aimed at Newcastle. “It’s nice when you have someone to be
  with,” said the Serb in a statement offered to Talksport, “but even nicer when
  you know who you’ll never be with again.” Newcastle blame Lemic for advising
  Isak to go on strike as he tried to engineer a route to Anfield. Isak was all
  smiles as he was pictured training with his Sweden teammates on the outskirts
  of Stockholm at the start of the international break on Tuesday. He is
  scheduled to address the Swedish football media alongside his international
  manager, the former Newcastle striker Jon Dahl Tomasson, later this week. It
  is unclear how much involvement Isak will have in Sweden’s upcoming World Cup
  qualifiers in Slovenia and Kosovo after not playing first-team football for so
  long.
