  Good morning. It started in the Caribbean: Barbados and Jamaica recognised a
  Palestinian state in April 2024. Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas followed
  weeks later, meaning that all Caribbean Community states had recognised
  Palestine. At the end of May 2024, Ireland, Spain and Norway formally
  recognised Palestine. Then it spread. Last month, France became the first G7
  country to announce it would follow suit, pledging recognition this September.
  Malta, the UK and Canada have signalled they could do the same, though London
  and Ottawa attached conditions. Other countries, including Andorra, Australia,
  Finland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Portugal and San Marino, have signed a
  declaration that indicates they may be next. The shrinking number of countries
  refusing to recognise Palestine has played a significant role in this surge.
  It’s a club few now want to be part of. So too has a landmark ruling from last
  year’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) case against Israel. Not the case
  examining whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, which will take years
  to conclude, but the one on the legality of Israel’s nearly six-decade-long
  occupation of the Palestinian territories. To understand how this ruling has
  galvanised recognition as well as growing calls for boycotts and sanctions
  against Israel, I spoke to Haroon Siddique, the Guardian’s legal affairs
  correspondent. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Gaza | At least 91
  people have been killed and 600 wounded while waiting for aid in Gaza over the
  past 24 hours, as the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, visits Israel for ceasefire
  discussions and to inspect food distribution. NHS | Nine out of 10 nurses in
  England, Wales and Northern Ireland have rejected their 3.6% pay award and
  have warned that they could strike later this year unless their salaries are
  improved. Science | The world’s “oldest baby” has been born in the US from an
  embryo that was frozen in 1994, it has been reported. US news | US president
  Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 10%
  to 41% on imports from dozens of trade partners in his latest attempt to
  reshape the global economy. Hong Kong | Former Hong Kong politician and
  prominent democracy campaigner Carmen Lau has accused British police of
  requesting she “self-censor” and retreat from public life. In depth: History’s
  heavy hand Hold your breath, but we’ll need to start with a little history
  lesson – specifically the events of 1967. After the six-day war between Israel
  and four Arab states, Israeli forces took control of East Jerusalem, the West
  Bank and Gaza, as well as the Golan Heights and Sinai, in a series of rapid
  military advances. This reshaped the balance of power in the region. The war
  later opened the door to peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, but it also
  marked the start of a decades-long occupation of what the international
  community recognises as the Palestinian territories: East Jerusalem, the West
  Bank and Gaza. With the peace process long stalled and illegal settlements in
  those areas continuing to expand, the situation has hardened into a brutal,
  prolonged and unresolved impasse. Mainstream Israeli politics includes voices
  asserting that Israel has a rightful claim to all the occupied territories,
  and harder-line positions calling for the expulsion of Palestinians have also
  influenced government policy in recent years, as Benjamin Netanyahu moved
  further right to retain control of his coalition. In 2022, the Palestinian
  delegation at the UN asked the general assembly to seek an advisory opinion
  from the ICJ on whether Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories
  complied with international law, the legality of the settlements, and how
  other states should respond. The request passed with majority support, Haroon
  told me. “The judgment that followed was historic because of how unequivocal
  and wide-ranging it was.” *** The question of apartheid This time last year,
  the ICJ ordered Israel to immediately end its occupation of the Palestinian
  territories and pay full reparations to Palestinians. The advisory opinion
  concluded that Israel had violated international law in several ways,
  including denying Palestinians their inalienable right to self determination
  and inflicting policies that amounted to apartheid. Perhaps most importantly,
  the court advised that other states are obliged not to recognise the
  occupation as lawful and not to aid or assist it. “It also said Israel needed
  to make full reparations for wrongful acts and essentially concluded that what
  Israel was doing violated international law,” Haroon said. “Some people
  interpreted the judgment as saying there was apartheid, and to me it seemed
  explicit. They said settlers and Palestinians are treated differently and
  that’s enshrined in Israeli law and other measures. There is almost complete
  separation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between Israeli settlers and
  Palestinian communities,” Haroon said, explaining that the court said Israel
  was in breach of article 3 of the international convention on the elimination
  of all forms of racial discrimination (CERD), which condemns racial
  segregation and apartheid. The court found multiple breaches of international
  law, including forcible evictions, widespread demolitions, settlement
  expansion, failure to curb settler violence, restrictions on water access,
  exploitation of resources, and the extension of Israeli law to the West Bank
  and East Jerusalem. *** A clear message to other states There was also a lot
  in the court’s opinion about other states’ relations to Israel, Haroon said.
  “The court said other states shouldn’t render aid or assistance that
  entrenches the occupation. For example, they shouldn’t do trade or economic
  activity with settlements.” How did the UK respond? During the hearings, the
  Conservative government argued that the ICJ should not issue an advisory
  opinion at all. Now, under Labour, the position is even less clear. “Last
  year, the Labour government simply said, ‘We’ll take this in and get back to
  you,’ but they haven’t issued any substantial response since. This has caused
  concern and anger among groups advocating for Palestinians. The only comment
  the UK government has made is that they don’t disagree with the central
  findings of the advisory opinion. That’s vague: it doesn’t say what they’re
  doing about it,” Haroon said. He notes that Britain, for instance, does not
  ban the import of goods produced in Israeli settlements. “Earlier this year, a
  group of 62 MPs and peers wrote to the trade secretary saying they should ban
  those imports, citing the ICJ judgment, but nothing’s happened.” Last month,
  Caabu (the Council for Arab-British Understanding) sent a letter signed by 112
  parliamentarians demanding that the UK government publish a response to the
  ICJ ruling. A separate letter followed from 16 civil society organisations,
  “The government said it’s a complex ruling, but a year on, it feels like
  foot-dragging, and it makes people think it’s political,” Haroon said. Others
  have mobilised into action. In April, Ireland unveiled a bill to ban imports
  from the occupied Palestinian territories in the first move by an EU member to
  curtail trade in goods produced in Israeli settlements illegal under
  international law. Ireland based the legality of its move on the ICJ ruling.
  *** Israel’s response For its part, Israel didn’t participate in the case
  (though it’s worth noting they did participate in the genocide case against
  them). “Israel later called the opinion ‘fundamentally wrong and one-sided,’
  saying it was trying to push a political settlement on them, but that
  settlements could only be reached by negotiations,” said Haroon. “They also
  submitted a written argument, saying the questions put to the court were
  prejudiced and failed to recognise Israel’s rights and duty to protect its
  citizens or its security concerns.” *** The ‘Montevideo Convention’ So how
  does the ICJ case relate to recognition of a Palestinian state? “The court
  said that the violations, such as the occupation and the settlements, were
  preventing the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination. They said
  Israel abused its position as an occupying power,” Haroon said. “I would say
  the recent French recognition of a Palestinian state is very much in keeping
  with what this judgment was saying, because it was about ending the
  occupation. The court said Israel should withdraw immediately. Anything that
  pushes towards a Palestinian state, including recognition, is consistent with
  the ruling.” The UK announcement of recognising a Palestinian state has been
  met with furious pushback. Those against recognition now warn that it goes
  against International law. They note that under the Montevideo Convention, a
  state must have a permanent population, defined territory, government, and the
  capacity to engage with other states. The peers argue that Palestine may not
  meet these criteria. The UK government have dismissed this argument. It is
  worth noting that some advocates for Palestinian rights also criticise
  recognition. Hussein Agha and Robert Malley argued in a forceful opinion piece
  that it amounts to little more than a symbolic gesture and will not halt the
  deaths and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza caused by Israel’s siege and war.
  Either way, what happens at the UN general assembly this September in relation
  to the two‑state solution will be written into the history books. What else

  scheme from the Netherlands - and hope it can spread! Phoebe Intrigued by this
  What we’re reading piece on books enjoyed in July, because Welsh is on the
  mark about Seán Hewitt, who is a real force to be reckoned with. Definitely
  need to check out ‘Hunted’ by Abir Mukherjee. Anandita Interesting piece from
  Larry Elliott on the one-sided EU-US trade deal and how it’s a historic
  admission of weakness for Europe. Phoebe Sport Cricket | Gus Atkinson and Josh
  Tongue took two India wickets apiece on day one of the fifth Test before Chris
  Woakes was forced off for England. The 36-year-old was scheduled to have a
  scan on Thursday evening, with his ability to take an active part in the
  remainder of the game to be assessed overnight. Rugby | Blair Kinghorn and
  James Ryan will start for the British &amp; Irish Lions in their third Test
  against the Wallabies in Sydney on Saturday. Ryan replaces Ollie Chessum, who
  has been named on the bench. Athletics | After the sorrow of 2021, world
  indoor 400m champion Amber Anning talks about her determination to race at the
  World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September. “The gold is always the
  goal,” she says. The front pages “The mathematics of starvation: How Israel
  caused a famine in Gaza,” is the lead story on the Guardian today. Also
  focusing on the conflict in Gaza, the i says: “No negotiation with terrorists:
  Starmer defends ultimatum to Israel - but won’t issue one to Hamas.” “Record
  number of foreign sex offenders in British prison,” is the splash at the Daily
  Express, while the Times says: “1 in 8 of all prisoners were born overseas.
  “‘Labour bid to silence migrant hotel critics’, is the lead story over at the
  Telegraph, while the Mail runs with, “Proof Starmer’s smash the gangs
  campaign’s a joke.” “Drug crisis scared me to death and I’m going straight,”
  is the splash on the Daily Record. Meanwhile the FT highlights the latest in
  tech news with the headline: “Microsoft market value touches $4tn as US tech
  stocks surge to fresh highs.” Finally the Mirror with: “Man, 76, arrested
  ‘poisoned’ at summer camp.” Something for the weekend Our critics’ roundup of
  the best things to watch, read, play and listen to right now TV The Assassin |
  ★★★★★ A menopausal assassin has been a long time coming, even though there is
  literally no more perfect pairing in the world than a woman rapidly emptying
  of oestrogen and a gun. The Assassin is perfectly crafted preposterousness. It
  is stylish, witty, tightly written, even more tightly paced and takes the job
  of massively entertaining us at every turn with the proper amount of
  seriousness. Lucy Mangan Film My Beautiful Laundrette | ★★★★★ Now getting a
  40th anniversary rerelease, this classic British comedy from screenwriter
  Hanif Kureishi and director Stephen Frears has for me the jaunty spirit of
  Ealing. It is a sharp, smart picture, with English eccentricity, sly quirk and
  political subversion, that represents a brilliant and almost unique engagement
  with contemporary history in 80s British cinema: a satire of Mrs Thatcher’s
  Britain which involved playing Toryism at its own game. Peter Bradshaw Art and
  design Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty Years | ★★★★★ Rural life hits you in the face
  like the stink of cow dung as soon as you step into the Royal Scottish
  Academy. This is the Clarkson’s Farm of art retrospectives, plunging today’s
  urbanites into the raw sadness and beauty, the violence and slow natural
  cycles of the British countryside. Goldsworthy may love nature but he doesn’t
  sentimentalise it. It is our connection with nature he wants to reawaken, not
  in a quiet contemplative way but as a shock. Jonathan Jones Music Tyler, the
  Creator: Don’t Tap the Glass | ★★★★☆ Musical reference points are deployed
  with an evident love and understanding of the source material, never feeling
  like box-ticking or pastiche; the hooks work with enviable efficiency. It’s
  all funky enough that you imagine even the selfie-obsessed pocketing their
  phone and throwing themselves around if it came booming from some big
  speakers. Alexis Petridis Today in Focus Did lead poisoning help create a
  generation of serial killers? The Pulitzer prize-winning author Caroline
  Fraser grew up in Seattle in the 1970s, a decade that has the highest crime
  rates in recent US history. At that time the US was entering a peak era of
  serial killers, and Fraser tells Michael Safi what it was like, especially for
  a woman, to grow up with violent men like Ted Bundy and the Green River Killer
  operating locally. Cartoon of the day | Jason White The Upside A bit of good
  news to remind you that the world’s not all bad In a rare moment of glory for
  AI, which is usually in the news for taking jobs or helping kids skip
  homework, the first AI-run NHS physio clinic has halved the waiting list for
  back pain and musculoskeletal services. This successful pilot was accessible
  to 2,500 patients in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough - where wait times were
  as long as 18 months. One patient described the AI physio as ‘intuitive.’
  Although the root cause of long waiting lists, recruitment freezes stopping
  (human) physiotherapists from entering work, remains, and an app-based
  interface may be inaccessible - this seems like a welcome innovation for some
  who need imminent care. Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent
  to you every Sunday Bored at work? And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are
  here to keep you entertained throughout the day. Until tomorrow. Quick
