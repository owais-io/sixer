  Nike has extended its Women’s Super League sponsorship deal in an innovative
  partnership, with the company to provide free boots to all players in the top
  two divisions who do not have endorsement contracts with other manufacturers.
  Sources with knowledge of the deal told the Guardian that approximately 250
  players from the WSL and WSL2 have signed up to receive boots from Nike as
  part of the partnership, with many of them having been forced previously to
  buy their own match‑day and training footwear as their clubs were not
  supplying them. As part of the five-year deal, Nike will also provide gloves
  to all goalkeepers playing in the top two tiers, and match balls for the WSL,
  WSL2 and Women’s League Cup. The WSL and Nike, which began supplying balls for
  all three competitions three years ago, declined to comment. The players who
  have registered for boots represent around half the first‑team squad members
  in the top two divisions, providing a clear insight into the lack of provision
  previously on offer. Despite the huge growth in women’s football in recent
  years on the back of England’s two European Championship wins, with the
  majority of Sarina Wiegman’s squad becoming household names, sponsored boot
  deals have remained out of reach for many of their teammates. Goalkeepers,
  defenders and older players have struggled for endorsement deals, with the
  boot companies primarily targeting youngsters and goal scorers they judge most
  likely to generate attention-grabbing social media content, leaving many
  others spending thousands of pounds each season. The average WSL salary is
  understood to be just over £50,000 so that is a significant outlay, with many
  players left relying on senior teammates or agents to call in extra boots from
  their sponsors. For several years the Professional Footballers Association had
  provided assistance with a £300 boot voucher given to each WSL player,
  although that did not cover those in the second tier as WSL2 players have yet
  to be granted membership. Nike was already supplying boots to all Chelsea and
  Tottenham players as a condition of sponsorship deals with those clubs, an
  arrangement that has now been rolled out to the other 22 clubs. For a number
  of big-name players with boot contracts, however, the rewards can be extremely
  lucrative, and in some cases are worth more than their salaries. Starting at
  about £5,000 a year and rising to £80,000 for the biggest names at
  trophy-winning clubs such as Chelsea and Arsenal, some of the bonuses on offer
  are good, with one leading manufacturer understood to pay £30,000 to clients
  who win the World Cup and £20,000 for the European Championship. The WSL
  returns on Friday with Chelsea, the champions, facing Manchester City at
  Stamford Bridge. Arsenal, the European champions, welcome the newly promoted
  London City Lionesses to the Emirates Stadium, the venue for all their home
  league games this season, on Saturday, and on the following day the Merseyside
  derby takes place at Anfield in another sign of the growth of the women’s
  game. In other respects, it remains light years behind the men’s game, with
  the total summer transfer spending of WSL clubs yet to pass £3m ahead of
  deadline day on Thursday, £1m of which was spent by Arsenal on their record
  purchase of Olivia Smith from Liverpool. Premier League clubs, in contrast,
  spent £3.19bn during the transfer window.
