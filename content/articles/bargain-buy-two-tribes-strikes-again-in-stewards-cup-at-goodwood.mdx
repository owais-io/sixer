  A £30,000 yearling that turned out to be a Classic winner hooked Phil
  Cunningham into the racing game 20 years ago. A similarly shrewd purchase gave
  the owner one of his best days at the track on the final day of Glorious
  Goodwood. Two Tribes, one of three runners in Cunningham’s colours in the
  Stewards’ Cup, picked up the £75,000 first prize in a valuable handicap at
  Ascot last week and added £125,000 for this feature race with an emphatic
  two-and-a-quarter length defeat of Strike Red. His two stable companions at
  the Richard Spencer yard crossed the line in fourth and fifth. “He was a
  four-grand foal,” Cunningham said. “That makes it even sweeter.” Better yet
  for Cunningham, Two Tribes is by the stallion Rajasinghe, who won the 2017
  Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot for the owner in a course-record time.
  Cunningham was so frustrated at breeders’ lack of interest in Rajasinghe in
  the early years of his stud career that he announced this year that he would
  offer his services for free. “It’s massive,” he said. “We believed in the
  horse, but unfortunately not many others have, so it’s great to see him start
  getting some results. He’s still a track-record holder at Royal Ascot and at
  three grand [per cover] I couldn’t give him away, so in the end, I did give
  him away. “He did 58 covers after we did the free deal and at least I know
  he’s going to have some runners on the track in a couple of years’ time. If we
  hadn’t made that decision, he’d have been sub-10.” It was Cockney Rebel, the
  winner of the 2,000 Guineas in England and Ireland in 2007 and the first horse
  Cunningham owned outright, that gave a huge kickstart to his career on the
  turf. The colt is remembered in the name of his Rebel Racing and “it has just
  got bigger and bigger” ever since. “It’s my passion and fortunately it’s not
  my job,” said Cunningham, the founder and chief executive of an insurance
  business, . “That makes it a bit easier to speculate. We changed the policy
  [two years ago]. This is the second year where we’ve tried to buy a better
  quality of horse, spent more money. I wanted to come to days like today, you
  do get spoiled when you get a taste for it. “We’ll be reinvesting again at the
  yearling sales this year. We’ve already got six homebreds to come in as
  two-year-olds.” Waardah could be a horse to look out for in the last three
  months of the season after Owen Burrows’s lightly raced three-year-old stepped
  up to a mile-and-three-quarters in ultimately decisive style in the Group Two
  Lillie Langtry Stakes. Waardah has an entry in the Group One Yorkshire Oaks
  this month, but the Fillies &amp; Mares event at Ascot on Champions Day in
  October is a likelier assignment. “I thought she was going to get outstayed,
  but in the last half-furlong she was probably going away again,” Burrows said.
  “She will have no trouble going back to a mile-and-a-half either, so she is an
  exciting filly. “She is in the Yorkshire Oaks, though it’s important she gets
  a little bit of juice in the ground. We will see how she comes out of this,
  but Ascot at the end of the year for the [Group One] Fillies &amp; Mares would
  be right up her street.”
