  Far-right anger over asylum hotels is destroying the very idea of refuge – and
  that’s probably the goal | Zoe Williams

  When the high court ruled this week that the Bell hotel in Epping could no
  longer be used to house asylum seekers, the triumph of anti-migrant zealots
  looked a little unwarranted, or at least premature. Nigel Farage hoped loudly
  that the ruling would provide “inspiration to others across the country”.
  Tabloids and GB News called it an all-caps VICTORY, while Epping locals popped
  champagne on the hotel’s doorstep. Meanwhile, the ruling itself felt
  impermanent and technical more than principled. The judge ruled that Somani,
  the company that owns the Bell, had not notified the council of its intended
  use; it was hardly an endorsement of the general proposition, memorably
  spelled out by Robert Jenrick recently, that “men from backward countries who
  broke into Britain illegally” pose an active threat to his daughters. And
  while the victory calls were resounding, there was no answering message of
  defeat from those who support asylum seekers – nobody thinks hotels are a
  sound and humane way to accommodate refugees. Liminal, often squalid,
  eye-wateringly expensive for the Home Office, they hardly scream “welcome”.
  Yet the ruling has been seismic, and the victory cries of the right are
  logical. Within 24 hours, the Home Office’s plans on migration have been put
  into disarray. It is obliged to house asylum seekers while their claims are
  being heard, and at the end of March there were 30,000 people living in about
  200 hotels. The plan had been to phase out hotels by 2029, a date that made no
  sense unless its real aim was to kick the whole issue into the next term. Now,
  the Bell has to be emptied by 12 September. As other local councils follow
  Epping’s lead, the government will be left scrambling to disperse people into
  local authority housing at very short notice, with a duty to keep track of
  them but no obvious way of doing so. More than this, the ruling has solidified
  a sense of legitimate, citizen anger against refugees. Since the Southport
  riots, there has been a familiar ratchet: hard-right provocateurs generate
  real life protests, often from great distances, because when you’re organising
  on Telegram anyone can count as a “local resident”. Demonstrations and rioters
  themselves are often explicitly Islamophobic – when they don’t muster at an
  asylum hotel, they gather at a mosque – and are used as proof that this is the
  natural stance of the average Briton. Commentators parse these explosions as a
  mixture of hard-right agitating and authentic local feeling – unknowable what
  the ratio is, they agree sagely – and the anger, being dramatic and
  observable, grows in stature. It’s now impossible to have a debate about
  immigration without acknowledging this huge wellspring of fury, and it is
  simply not the done thing to ask whether the rage is justified. Anger, being
  authentic, never has to explain itself. This court ruling is both illustrative
  of and instrumental in the solidity of fury as a political instrument. The
  judge granted the injunction after hearing the local council’s complaints that
  planning law had been breached in changing the site’s use. But underlying
  this, the council also cited disruption caused by recent protests. An asylum
  seeker from the hotel was accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl
  and concerns were raised about potential future threats. Since then, the hotel
  has become a site of protest, with large groups gathering with flares, flags
  and signs. Extrapolating from an assault accusation that all asylum seekers
  pose a danger is racist. There are concerns about other public disorder
  charges, but that sort of offence can be self-fulfilling. If your
  accommodation is regularly surrounded by a small, hostile mob that sometimes
  wants to set fire to it, it’s probably quite difficult to slot into a normal,
  law-abiding life, or even know what a law-abiding life looks like, in this
  country you escaped to, having heard it was civilised. Completely absent in
  this debate – which apparently we are all too frightened to have, yet we have
  constantly – is any sense of a better idea. If the problem with refugees is
  that they arrive illegally, would it help to have more legal routes? If the
  hotels are the issue, could we not work towards dispersal in the first
  instance, and much faster processing of claims? Is there no world in which we
  could engage imaginatively with the violence and upheaval that people are
  fleeing, and pull together to support them until they’re legally able to
  support themselves? That seems to be the reasonable expectation with Ukrainian
  refugees: if we can’t extend the same empathy to those from Pakistan,
  Afghanistan, Iran and Bangladesh, can anyone at least explain why? Would a
  refresher in the political context of those countries help? If the problem is
  the numbers, can anyone explain how many asylum seekers they would like
  instead? We currently rank fifth when compared to European nations in the
  absolute number of asylum claims received, and 17th when numbers are adjusted
  for population – should we be 20th? Does anyone want to resile from the 1951
  UN refugee convention? That would seem to be implicit in Reform UK’s promise
  to leave the European convention on human rights, but would any party or
  organisation that doesn’t want that care to explain how it is executing its
  duty towards refugees, and plans to do so in the future? The problem with
  anger as a political instrument – well, one of the problems, alongside the
  violence – is that it’s never called upon to be articulate or constructive. It
  would undermine its own strength if it were. There was another element of the
  campaign that led to this ruling, which is subtle but important: the erasure
  of the category of refugee and asylum seeker. When you make the focus of your
  argument a hotel and its planning status, on the surface this is a battle over
  place. But if you take away the refuge someone is seeking, are they a refugee?
  If you take away the protection granted to them by the state, there is no
  asylum to claim. How, then, do we define these people? Without a political
  definition, do they exist? Even though the issue is very different, it’s not
  tactically dissimilar to the legal campaign waged against trans people,
  resulting in April’s ruling that everyone has to use the toilets and other
  facilities of their biological sex. It doesn’t say you have no right to live
  as trans; it’s just unfortunately impractical for you to do so unless you stay
  at home. Do you still exist, do you still have rights? The problem with anger
  in politics is that combustion is the only way to expend the built-up energy.
  It’s much easier to keep things humane and civilised in the first place. But
  it’s too late to wish we had done that – an injection of humanity is the only
  way to cool things down. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist This article was
  amended on 22 August 2025. An error introduced at the editing stage had
  created ambiguity around what offences the writer felt were self-fulfilling.
