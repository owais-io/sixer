  A former California correctional officer convicted of dozens of sexual abuse
  charges at a women’s prison was sentenced to 224 years in prison on Thursday.
  Gregory Rodriguez, 57, worked as a guard at the Central California women’s
  facility (CCWF), the state’s largest women’s prison, and was found guilty in
  January of more than 60 charges of abusing nine women in his custody,
  including rape and battery. Rodriguez’s case became a huge scandal for the
  state, exposing a longstanding crisis of sexual misconduct and abuse behind
  bars. The officer was found to have targeted incarcerated women over the span
  of nearly a decade before he retired in 2022 while under investigation. A
  Guardian investigation published in 2023 revealed the prison received a report
  of Rodriguez’s abuse in 2014, but did not terminate him and instead punished
  the victim. That survivor spoke of being sent to solitary confinement while
  authorities investigated claims of her abuse. It is rare for prison officers
  to be criminally charged and convicted for on-duty sexual misconduct, despite
  data suggesting abuse by guards is a systemic problem in California and across
  the US. Misconduct records disclosed by the California department of
  corrections and rehabilitation (CDCR) showed that from 2014 to 2023, hundreds
  of incarcerated women filed complaints of staff sexual abuse, but only four
  officers were terminated for sexual misconduct in that timeframe. Rodriguez,
  who worked for the CDCR for 27 years, isolated victims in areas without
  cameras and coerced them into sex by offering items such as gum or tobacco and
  threatening to “make prison very difficult” if they did not comply, according
  to prison investigators’ and victims’ lawsuits. The majority of rapes charged
  by prosecutors occurred in 2021 and 2022 in the board of parole hearings area,
  where incarcerated residents have confidential attorney meetings and appear
  before commissioners to plead for their freedom. One woman struggling with
  substance use disorder said Rodriguez coerced her into sex by offering to get
  her addiction medication, but instead of getting her a prescription, he gave
  her heroin, which led her to overdose. In announcing the sentence, Judge
  Katherine Rigby recounted how Rodriguez lured his victims and tried to hide
  his assaults, saying the survivors would suffer “lifelong impacts”. She said:
  “These victims were put in unfathomable and untenable positions, and they
  could not leave as they were incarcerated.” Rodriguez had pleaded not guilty
  and his attorney sought to cast doubt on victims’ accounts at trial. He was
  convicted on a majority of the more than 90 charges prosecutors brought on
  behalf of 13 women, though for some counts the jury was hung or found him not
  guilty. His lawyers had asked for a 56-year sentence, and Rodriguez told the
  judge his daughter was sick and needed support. His family also testified on
  his behalf. After his conviction, his attorney, Roger Wilson, said: “The jury
  clearly believed some inmates and disbelieved others.” Wilson did not
  immediately respond to an inquiry. Some survivors testified in court last
  month in front of Rodriguez, including Nikki, who spoke out to the Guardian in
  2023 from behind bars and has since been released. She has been referred to by
  her first name in court proceedings. “For over a decade, I have lived in the
  aftermath of what you did to me,” she said in court, according to a copy of
  her statement she shared with the Guardian. “I was an incarcerated woman –
  vulnerable, alone, stripped of dignity, humanity and power … You used that
  moment to feed on me. You hunted me … What you did was predatory, manipulative
  and evil. You violated me under the cloak of authority … You raped me when I
  had no freedom to run, no rights to call upon, no one I could tell without
  fear of retaliation. You didn’t just hurt me, you shattered something sacred
  inside me. I’m still trying to crawl out of the hole you put me in.” She said
  he had “groomed” her, saying he “exploited my isolation, my loneliness, my
  hunger for basic humanity … You built a prison inside the prison, and I still
  live in that.” She added: “I will no longer whisper the truth that you, your
  lawyer and CDCR tried to bury. This statement is for me so I can start to
  reclaim what you tried to take from me.” In an interview this week before
  sentencing, Nikki said she would not stay quiet: “I’m doing this for the women
  who are still inside … who are too terrified to speak out, because that was
  once me, too.” She said the CDCR was “run by bullies protecting themselves”
  and that while incarcerated, she faced harassment and intimidation after
  Rodriguez’s abuse came to light: “It was their way of silencing and
  normalizing the trauma they perpetuate … This was never about one bad apple.
  CDCR enabled Rodriguez, who got away with rape for years, and more abusers
  hide in plain sight. How many more women must be broken before we call this
  what it is: an injustice?” On Thursday, before the sentence was announced, one
  incarcerated victim cried as she testified by Zoom from prison, condemning
  Rodriguez for failing to take responsibility or express remorse. Addressing
  his family, she said: “He didn’t think about his daughter when he raped me. He
  didn’t care about me being someone’s daughter … I will encourage women to
  speak up because there are too many men like you who are still out there.”
  Another survivor’s statement, read by a victim’s advocate, said that after
  Rodriguez raped her, she asked the CDCR for STD and pregnancy tests, but
  officials told her she would have to admit engaging in “risky behavior” and
  could face discipline and a lengthened sentence. She criticized the department
  for not terminating supervisors and other officers who “allowed this to
  continue for so long” despite knowing about Rodriguez’s abuse. She said: “The
  system has failed.” The CDCR previously said it had identified more than 22
  potential victims of Rodriguez. A department spokesperson said on Thursday the
  sentence “reaffirms CDCR’s own internal investigation and referral” to
  prosecutors: “The department resolutely condemns any staff member – especially
  a peace officer who is entrusted to enforce the law – who violates their oath
  and shatters public trust.” The spokesperson referred to a 2022 statement that
  said the CDCR enforces a “zero-tolerance policy for sexual violence”, that
  retaliation against people who report abuse “is not tolerated”, and that it
  was expanding its system of surveillance cameras to assist in “preventing or
  detecting misconduct by both staff and inmate alike”. Last year, the US
  Department of Justice under the Biden administration opened a civil rights
  investigation into staff sexual abuse at CCWF and California’s other women’s
  prison, citing the Rodriguez case and hundreds of lawsuits. The justice
  department noted that officers accused of misconduct included “the very people
  responsible for handling complaints of sexual abuse”. Under Trump, the justice
  department has dismissed police civil rights abuse cases brought by the
  previous administration, but advocates said the inquiry into California prison
  misconduct is ongoing. A justice department spokesperson declined to comment,
  and the CDCR spokesperson referred to a statement from last year saying the
  department “embraces transparency” and welcomed the investigation. •
