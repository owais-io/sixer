  Some time ago, an acquaintance sent me a cryptic text message. “Thought of you
  after I saw one of your recent articles,” they said. “Thank you for saying
  it.” I write columns regularly. Some are about vaginas; some are about the
  genocide in Gaza. Was this person thanking me for drawing attention to the
  desperate plight of people on eBay who are prepared to pay five times the
  original sales price for Gwyneth Paltrow’s delisted This Smells Like My Vagina
  candle? Or were they referencing Gaza? I suspected the latter, but there was
  no way of immediately knowing – which often feels par for the course when it
  comes to the conversation around Gaza. The Trump administration has cracked
  down on pro-Palestinian speech to such a draconian degree that even within a
  private text message, some people are too terrified about jeopardising their
  career or immigration status to speak up. Many lawmakers and parts of the
  media seem to have lost the ability to communicate in plain English when it
  comes to Palestine. I have seen long articles handwringing about the
  desperately complicated situation of starving kids which don’t mention the
  word “Israel” once. I have lost count of the number of articles talking about
  “starvation stalking Gaza” that circle endlessly around exactly how this
  starvation has come about. Gaza is almost completely destroyed. There is now a
  growing consensus that a genocide is under way, and since a plan for the mass
  displacement of Palestinians to make space for a “Gaza riviera” was discussed
  in the Knesset, more people are beginning to speak up. Nevertheless,
  Gaza-related atrocity denial is so widespread in the US, and the climate of
  fear around speaking about Palestine so pervasive, that an influential person
  voicing an unequivocal criticism of Israel’s conduct will still make the news.
  See, for example, John Oliver. The Last Week Tonight host made headlines this
  week after he opened his most recent show with a clear-eyed analysis of the
  human-made famine in Gaza. “Look, ‘Gaza is starving’ is a sentence that’s
  objectively true, but it’s also slightly misleading because it’s too passive,”
  Oliver said. “Gaza is being starved by Israel.” I’m glad to see Oliver
  spelling this out. But it is enraging that it is a late-night host speaking
  with clarity rather than editorial boards, cable news anchors or politicians –
  many of whom seem to treat mass starvation as an unfortunate and unintentional
  consequence of war rather than a deliberate act. One CBS video from last
  December, for example, is headlined: “Hunger spreads virtually everywhere in
  Gaza amid Israel-Hamas war.” As the Al Jazeera Journalism Review argues, many
  headlines in major US outlets have similarly described the situation as a
  “food crisis” rather than an intentional blockade. Meanwhile, the rightwing
  Free Press – which CBS is reportedly mulling buying for up to $250m partly
  because of its “pro-Israel stance”, according to the FT – described media
  reporting around starvation in Gaza as part of “a highly effective campaign of
  information warfare” against Israel perpetrated by Hamas. And while experts
  have been warning about famine risks in Gaza since December 2023, an analysis
  of US media coverage by the watchdog Fair shows most outlets barely covered
  the situation until it became undeniably grim. “The conditions of famine have
  been out in the open for well over a year, and yet it was considered barely
  newsworthy in US news media,” it says. Oliver isn’t the only late-night host
  speaking up. Indeed, from the shenanigans of the Trump administration to the
  starvation of Gaza, late-night hosts (and children’s entertainer Ms Rachel)
  seem to have become the moral voice of the US. The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart
  has also been outspoken about Gaza. “I have a moral clarity about what I’m
  seeing,” said Stewart, who is Jewish, in an episode last week where he was
  speaking to the Jewish Currents editor-at-large, Peter Beinart. “I feel like a
  crazy person. I feel as if I’m watching something that is so self-evidently
  inhumane and horrific. And to be told that I have to shut up because I risk
  the Jewish state by speaking out? I would say the opposite. I think they’re
  putting the likelihood of a surviving Jewish state much more at risk with this
  type of action.” And then there’s Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show on CBS.
  Colbert hasn’t spoken about Gaza a huge amount, although he did criticise the
  crackdown on student protests, saying: “Even if you don’t agree with the
  subject of their protests, as long as they are peaceful, students should be
  allowed to protest. It’s their first amendment right.” He has, however, been
  very outspoken about Trump. Last month, he said Paramount Global (which owns
  CBS) deciding to pay a large settlement to Trump over content in a CBS show,
  60 Minutes, amounted to a “big fat bribe”. Three days later, his show was
  cancelled – many suspect because Paramount higher-ups wanted to stay in
  Trump’s good books to get a merger approved. This seems to have worked. Trump
  has said: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.” I bet he does.
  Late-night hosts seem to be doing far more than certain other influential
  voices when it comes to speaking truth to power. None of this is funny – but
  when comedians become the most vocal truth-tellers, it’s possible your country
  has become a joke. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnist Do you have an
