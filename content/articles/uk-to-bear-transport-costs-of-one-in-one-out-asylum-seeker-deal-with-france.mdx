  The UK will pay the costs of transporting asylum seekers to and from France
  under Keir Starmer’s “one in, one out” deal with Emmanuel Macron, it has
  emerged. The deal will have to be renewed by 11 June next year, and can be
  ended at a month’s notice by either side, documents made public by the
  government indicate. A copy of the agreement was released on Tuesday as the
  prime minister comes under increasing pressure to stop boats carrying asylum
  seekers from crossing the Channel. The deal will allow the UK to return one
  person who has entered the country by irregular means in return for taking
  someone in France whose claim for asylum in the UK is expected to have a
  greater chance of success. It has been trumpeted by ministers as a
  “gamechanging” deal but Home Office sources said it will only apply to about
  50 asylum seekers at first. “All transport costs incurred in connection with
  readmission pursuant to this agreement shall be borne by the United Kingdom,”
  the documents state. They continue: “Those accepted for admittance [from
  France] … shall be provided by the United Kingdom with transport from a
  designated place to the United Kingdom (at the cost of the United Kingdom).”
  If people have an outstanding claim for asylum, they cannot be removed, the
  deal says. France can reject a requested removal if it “considers that an
  individual would be a threat to public policy, internal security, public
  health or the international relations of any of the Schengen states”. So far
  in 2025, 25,436 people have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in
  small boats – a record for this point in the year since data began being
  collected in 2018. This is up 48% on this point last year (17,170) and 70%
  higher than at this stage in 2023 (14,994), according to PA news agency
  analysis of Home Office data. At least 10 people have died while attempting
  the journey this year, according to reports by French and UK authorities, but
  there is no official record of fatalities in the Channel.
