  idiotic’ wartime request

  There is a photo – or at least a “fabled” photo – that would tie up a lot of
  loose ends in the strange story of Winston Churchill’s platypuses. Recent
  research has revived the tale of how the British prime minister asked
  Australia to send him a live monotreme at the height of the second world war.
  Sadly his namesake, Winston, died just two days before landing in England in
  1943 in now-disputed circumstances. But Associate Prof Nancy Cushing, an
  environmental history specialist at the University of Newcastle, says
  Winston’s journey would never have happened without the knowledge gained from
  another platypus, Splash, that was previously sent to Churchill – albeit after
  it had died and been stuffed. Cushing describes the connection between
  Churchill and the platypuses as “weirdly compelling”. Splash sat on
  Churchill’s desk while Operation Platypus – a series of reconnaissance
  missions in Borneo – was under way, academic research has found. “I think one
  thing we would have loved to have found, and is fabled to exist, is a
  photograph of Splash on Churchill’s desk,” Cushing says. “There hasn’t been
  really any discussion of [Splash’s journey to London]. And that was such a
  breakthrough.” Before its death, Splash was the first of the sensitive,
  duck-billed, beaverish animals to be successfully kept in captivity in
  Melbourne by Healesville Sanctuary’s Robert Eadie. “Without Splash there
  wouldn’t have been an attempt to send Winston. He defined how you look after a
  platypus in captivity.” ‘Magnificently idiotic’ Churchill famously kept a
  menagerie, which included kangaroos and black swans. In 1943, he asked
  Australia’s external affairs minister, Herbert “Doc” Evatt, if he could have
  not just one platypus but half a dozen, a request described by the zoo owner
  and author Gerald Durrell as “magnificently idiotic”. Monotremes, which
  include echidnas as well as platypuses, are distinct from other mammals
  because they lay eggs. With their duck-like bill, flat tail and partially
  webbed feet, they are so strange looking that many early European scientists
  studying specimens suspected they were a hoax. Cushing and Kevin Markwell,
  from Southern Cross University, wrote in 2009 in their paper Platypus
  diplomacy: animals gifts in international relations that efforts to fulfil
  Churchill’s request were motivated by a desire to secure his “personal
  affection” towards an Australia “which felt abandoned by Britain during the
  war”. “The feat of transferring the platypus would have brought acclaim to the
  Australians and viewing the platypus [at London Zoo] would have reminded
  embattled Londoners of their Australian cousins who were also facing the grim
  realities of war while raising morale by providing an opportunity to see an
  exotic animal for the first time,” they wrote in the Journal of Australian
  Studies. Officials charged with satisfying the British PM’s request approached
  Australia’s “father of conservation”, David Fleay, for help. Fleay wrote of
  his surprise in his 1980 book Paradoxical Platypus: hobnobbing with duckbills.
  “Winston Churchill had found time suddenly in the middle of the war to attempt
  to bring to fruition what was, apparently, a long-cherished ambition … he had
  actually approached our prime minister for no less than six platypuses!” he
  wrote. He described it as the “shock of a lifetime” and a “tremendous problem
  landed squarely in my lap”. Fleay pushed back against the idea of sending six
  platypuses on the dangerous mission but caught several and picked one to go.
  He named him Winston, built a “special travelling platypusary” for him (with
  burrows and a swimming tank) and trained a platypus keeper to look after him
  on the ship. “I thought it was a really weird thing to do when you’re running
  a country, running a war,” Fleay’s son, Stephen, tells Guardian Australia from
  Portugal. The platypus mission was secret at the time but Stephen gradually
  learned about it and says his father supervised the whole thing. “They’re
  very, very difficult to keep,” he says. “But he was completely, completely
  devoted to the animal.” Splash the ‘tame platypus’ Fleay built his knowledge
  on the work of Eadie, his predecessor at Healesville Sanctuary. “We occupied
  his original cottage when my father became director in ’37, ’38,” Stephen
  says. “He did a lot of pioneering work with the platypus, then my father took
  up his work.” It was Eadie who had successfully kept Splash in captivity until
  its death in 1937. Cushing and Markwell, referring to Eadie’s own writings,
  wrote that the preserved remains of Splash were “carefully packed and secretly
  despatched to London”. “When delivered to 10 Downing Street on 19 June 1943,
  accompanied by a leather-bound scientific description of the platypus and
  Eadie’s 1935 book The Life and Habits of the Platypus, with Sidelights on
  ‘Splash’ the Tame Platypus, Churchill was said to have been delighted and
  later to have displayed the platypus on his desk.” The University of
  Cambridge’s Natalie Lawrence wrote in the BBC Wildlife Magazine that Splash,
  who had been a “minor celebrity” in Australia, was sent as an “interim gift”
  while plans were made to keep Winston alive on the long sea journey. “[Splash]
  became almost entirely tame from his training by Robert Eadie, who had, as it
  happened, once saved Churchill’s life in the Boer war in South Africa,”
  Lawrence wrote. Brisbane’s Courier Mail reported in 1949, in an article about
  Eadie’s death, that he had indeed been part of a team that helped Churchill
  escape from captivity (though other accounts have him escaping on his own).
  Depth charges and heatstroke Winston the platypus set sail on the MV Port
  Philip but died just two days before he was due to reach land. The media at
  the time reported, presumably on advice of the authorities, that the Germans
  were to blame. On 1 November 1945, Adelaide’s the News reported that
  Churchill, “in the midst of his war-time worries, wanted an Australian
  platypus”. “And he would have got a specimen, a husky young male, but for
  German submarines,” the paper reported. Depth charges dropped when the Port
  Philip encountered the submarines caused the platypus to die of shock, the
  paper said. Fleay wrote that a heavy concussion would have killed the
  sensitive creatures. “After all, a small animal equipped with a nerve-packed,
  super-sensitive bill, able to detect even the delicate movements of a mosquito
  wriggler on stream bottoms in the dark of night, cannot hope to cope with
  man-made enormities such as violent explosions,” he wrote. But students from
  the University of Sydney studying Fleay’s collections in the Australian Museum
  Archives said in June that a shortage of worms to feed Winston, alongside heat
  stress, could have been factors as well as potential distress from the
  detonations. The ship’s logbook shows air temperatures soared above 30C and
  water temperatures rose above 27C for about a week as the ship crossed
  equatorial waters. Platypuses cannot regulate their body temperatures in
  environments warmer than 25C, the students wrote. “Heat stress alone would
  have been enough to kill Winston,” they wrote. “However, it is important to
  note that food restrictions and the shock of a depth charge, in combination
  with heat stress, likely had an additional impact on Winston’s wellbeing and
  together contributed to his demise.”
