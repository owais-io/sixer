  Surrey went clear of the rest at Chester-le-Street, a three-day win against
  Durham that puts them in prime position to swan gracefully in and collect
  their fourth Championship on the trot, with just three matches left in the
  season. India’s tall, elegant, slow left-armer Sai Kishore did exactly what he
  was signed for, zinging the Kookaburra through Durham, finishing with five for
  72. Meanwhile Jordan Clark gave the Overtons a run for their money by hitting
  younger brother Graham, who had batted very nicely for 42, on the grill with a
  stinging bouncer. Surrey, needing 176 for victory, had a mild wobble when they
  lost Ryan Patel and Rory Burns in consecutive overs, but 40 from Sam Curran
  set the sails fair. Things don’t look so rosy for Durham who, if Yorkshire win
  on Friday, have their boots in the relegation zone. Durham must also ride
  disquiet from members, who were unhappy to be told at an evening forum that
  the club would be voting for a conference structure for 2026. Nottinghamshire,
  who were sitting on Surrey’s coat-tails before this round, look certain to
  slip further behind despite a wonderful 208 from Haseeb Hameed, which made him
  the leading run-scorer in Division One. With the game still marooned in the
  first innings, and Somerset bowling with a 151-over ball, a draw seems
  inevitable. Matthew Revis danced to his third century in July, his unbeaten
  152 putting Yorkshire in a dominant position at North Marine Road. Sussex, 323
  runs behind on first-innings, made a dog’s breakfast of the start of their
  second, perhaps unnerved by the bangs coming from the naval warfare
  re-enactment at nearby Peasholm Park – three times a week in the school
  holidays. Imam-ul-Haq’s swooping run out and throw-down from extra cover to
  dismiss Tom Alsop would have had uncle Inzamam’s approval, if from the sofa.
  Unbeaten fifties from Daniel Hughes and Danial Ibrahim gave Sussex something
  to chew on overnight. Centuries from Justin Broad and Rob Keogh bulldozed
  Northants to 550-9dec, weary Derbyshire then lost four wickets. Sonny Baker’s
  five wickets for Hampshire will have given his Lions’ tour prospects a boost,
  Jake Libby propped up Worcestershire with an unbeaten 100. Nightwatchman Ethan
  Bamber flew to his first first-class century and helped Warwickshire avoid the
  follow-on at Chelmsford. And Lancashire had a bad day at Old Trafford,
  finishing with half the side out and 247 runs needed. Just 9.5 overs were
  possible at Canterbury and there was no play at Cheltenham. The covers are on,
  the massive seagulls chew sea-monsters out of the outfield, time for me to
  head home. Thanks for your lovely company – till tomorrow, good bye! DIVISION
  ONE Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT Durham 153 and 344 by five
  wickets. Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire 465-9 Trent Bridge:
  Nottinghamshire 511-6 v Somerset 438 New Road: Worcestershire 249 v Hampshire
  293 and 139-2 Scarborough: Yorkshire 545-9dec v Sussex 222 and 115-3 DIVISION
  TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 play abandoned for the
  day Canterbury: Kent 217-3 v Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Lancashire 137
  and 226-5 v Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec Northamptonshire: Northants 550-9dec v
  Derbyshire 377 and 52-4 Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT Durham
  153 and 344 by five wickets. The reigning champions go clear. Durham 3 points;
  Surrey 21. I suppose I’d better write up for the paper, with Dom Bess wheeling
  in from the Trafalgar Square end, his knees grass-stain free, the sun in full
  regalia. Do keep an eye on things BTL. That Imam run-out and rather joyous
  celebration. Play will resume at 5.30 at Canterbury. While bad light has
  stopped play at Chester le Street, with Surrey 135 for three, 41 runs from
  victory. Hoppsy thinks that will be that for the day, and CCLive! thanks him
  for his whimsy and hard-nosed reporting of the Durham member’s meeting. Hoppsy
  with the penultimate chapter from Chester le Street. The floodlights are on at
  The Riverside and there is a spark of life in this game. Surrey have lost 3
  for 94 in pursuit of 176. Dom Sibley’s pained 35 from 47 balls with a runner
  is looking invaluable after the loss of two more wickets in successive overs -
  Ryan Patel mistiming a pull against Mattie Potts and Rory Burns stumped when
  he advanced to Callum Parkinson and didn’t get into the same parish. You could
  have got a parish church and team of bell ringers in between him and the ball.
  Surrey want to finish this tonight and in theory they have ample time (18
  overs plus the extra half-hour) and wickets to do it, but the clouds are
  glowering and the floodlights beaming down. There is some turn for Parkinson,
  who has not had many opportunities this summer, was loaned out to
  Worcestershire for one match, and looks to be a rounder figure than when I
  last saw him. Can he turn it around? A third double century of the season for
  Haseeb Hameed, given out lying prone on his stomach after a calamity running
  mix-up for 208, and Notts have now drawn level with Somerset, with five
  first-innings wicket in hand. HH is now the leading run-scorer in Division
  One. Rob Keogh left high and mighty on 125. Reece 3-114. The lead over
  Derbyshire is 173, let’s see if they can make a better fist of things than
  Sussex have. I report a Surrey wobble. Maybe a sway? Two quick wickets – Patel
  and Burns in consecutive overs – 65 needed, seven wickets in hand. Back on at
  Scarborough, where Ibrahim is lucky to survive a corker from Sutherland and a
  diving Matthew Revis at gully – who seems to hurt something in the process and
  walks off for running repairs. It is fabulous that Scarborough CC provide a
  drinking water tap, just a shame it is located right outside the open window
  of the gents…also appreciate the miniature olive tree in a pot brought along
  for authenticity by the Souvlaki stall. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Durham
  153 and 344 v Surrey 322 and 64-1 Surrey need 112 to win Chelmsford: Essex
  602-6dec v Warwickshire 313-5 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 387-4 v Somerset
  438 New Road: Worcestershire 249 v Hampshire 293 Scarborough: Yorkshire
  545-9dec v Sussex 222 and 29-3 DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v
  Middlesex 445 play abandoned for the day Canterbury: Kent 217-3 v
  Leicestershire 471 rain Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 and 5-1 v Glamorgan 261
  and 348-7dec Northamptonshire: Northants 516-7 v Derbyshire 377 Lancashire
  have safely negotiated the first ball of their chase. Sussex have calmed down
  and, an absolute run fest at Wantage Road when I wasn’t looking – Justin Broad
  has just been out for 171 and Rob Keogh has 113 after a barren season.
  Northants lead Derbys by 137. Everywhere else it is tea – scores to follow.
  And five wickets for Sonny Baker – at just the sort of time that might get him
  selected for a Lions Tour. Worcestershire all out 249, 44 short of Hampshire.
  Those five wickets for the Lancashire spinners, won’t trouble Mason six for 19
  Crane too much. Congratulations to Sam Northeast, 132, and Kiran Carlson, 108.
  Be good if they could keep things going till tomorrow when I’m supposed to be
  going to OT. And another, next ball! Milnes steams in and Coles wafts with an
  angle and edges to third slip. Off he slopes, and Sussex are 20 for three.
  What are Sussex doing?! A fabulous, swooping, pick-up and throw-down by
  Imam-ul-Haq at extra cover. Uncle Inzy would nod in approval, from the safety
  of the sofa. After a farcical run out chance/overthrow, Jack White takes an
  excellent caught and bowled to send Tom Haines back to the pavilion for seven.
  As background, a naval re-enactment at Peasholm Park occassionally interrupts
  to disturb the seagulls. And an email, hello there Phil Russell. “At the risk
  of jinxing it, not sure if anyone else has noted Ethan Bamber has gone past 50
  for the first time and is closing in on a maiden ton. He went in as night
  watchman last night for Warwickshire v Essex to protect Zen Malik (golden duck
  today). Pitch seems to be a road so might not get a better shot at it!”
  Currently on 82, Warwicks 280-4, 322 behind Essex. Three wickets for Sonny
  Baker at New Road, three slips for Jack White at Scarborough. Worcestershire
  are 56 short of Hampshire with two wickets left, and not yet half way through
  their match as the Yorkshire faithful turn to the final chapter. Jake Libby 93
  not out. More from CLS, where Hoppsy is watching the one game that will finish
  today. The ECB hopes that use of the Kookaburra will encourage the development
  of spin bowling, but it has also caused counties to scour the globe for
  short-term overseas signings to mask their deficiencies. Sai Kishore has been
  an excellent two-match acquisition for Surrey and his return of 41.4-12-72-5
  helped dismiss Durham for 344. Kishore, mop-haired, tall and dignified,
  skippers Tamil Nadu in India’s red-ball competition and has a feel of Ravindra
  Jadeja about him. He found occasional turn, but it was his relentless accuracy
  and insistent line that most impressed. He ended the innings thanks to a
  diving catch at short extra by Ryan Patel. It left Surrey needing 176 for
  victory, a target that feels very much attainable. Dom Sibley, who tweaked a
  groin in the field, is coming out to bat with a runner. Sibley with a runner
  feels more advantageous than Sibley acting as a runner, which does not bear
  thinking about. By the way, the steward on Gate 6 is a bit of a card. The car
  in front of me this morning approached a wide-open gate as if it was the
  narrowest entrance in Christendom. “When’s your re-test then?” joshed the
  steward. An exchange not immediately found in the Spectator Management manual,
  but it gave me a guilty smirk. As Revis passes 150, a standing ovation from
  the packed pavilion. Yorkshire lead by 323 and Sussex must bat for pretty much
  the rest of the match to escape with a draw. After Shane Snater’s two in two
  after lunch, Warwickshire have reverted to run accumulation at Chelmsford.
  They’re 253-4, still 200-odd short of the follow on. Bamber 76 not out. At
  CLS, Tom Lawes is a runner for Dom Sibley, something which has been outlawed
  in international games since 2011. As a like for like pair of legs, Sibley has
  done well. … five for Sai Kishore at CLS; while Notts still trail Somerset by
  117 – HH 162 not out, Jack Haynes 55 not out. No evidence here meaning no
  data. I feel like the Hundred probably has attracted new fans to other forms
  of cricket. Surely?! Though a source close to CCLive! suggests that the
  advertising might run only one way. Has anyone ever attended a Hundred match
  and seen advertising for Championship/one day cup cricket? An important
  message from Richard Gould in the last par to those counties who can feel the
  new money burning in their pocket. Frustrations, frustrations. Gloucestershire
  are so often stymied by the rain. Just one innings completed in three days.
  Wishing them peerless sunshine and a full house tomorrow. I was listening to
  the BBC’s Americast and Gloucestershire supporter wrote in to invite Anthony
  Zurcher to support the club, but also introduced the cast to the idea of Major
  League cricket. Zurcher plumped for Texas Super Kings over Washington Freedom,
  who lost to Mumbai Indians New York in the July final. Hopps listens in to the
  Durham members’ meeting. Praise earlier for Surrey’s opposition to the
  conference proposal for the Championship leads neatly to Durham, who are one
  of its chief proponents. Durham had their members meeting last night and
  informed them that they were voting for a three-division conference whatever
  the feedback. That has brought a predictable outcry on cricket forums. One
  member compared the meeting to a communist stitch-up with the result known in
  advance, another complained “ the first few tables are full of party
  apparatchiks and happy clappers.” Durham like the suggestion that all 18
  counties can potentially win the title when the season begins, but the
  argument seems to be turning against them. This match is also turning against
  them. They have just lost the seventh wicket, Codi Yuduf caught at the wicket.
  A wicket each today for Sai Kishore and, earlier, Dan Lawrence. The lead is
  147. Surrey should start worrying a little at what? 240? Spent 15 minutes of
  my lunch time sitting on a bench looking down on the surfers, dawdlers and
  dogs of North Bay. I’m a lucky girl. Oh dear, with a century daydreamable,
  George Hill swipes at Henry Crocombe and edges up in the air and down to mid
  on. Yorkshire 460 for seven. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Durham 153 and
  305-6 v Surrey 322 Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire 202-2 Trent
  Bridge: Nottinghamshire 271-3 v Somerset 438 New Road: Worcestershire 191-5 v
  Hampshire 293 Scarborough: Yorkshire 453-6 v Sussex 222 DIVISION TWO
  Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 no play before lunch
  Canterbury: Kent 217-3 v Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 v
  Glamorgan 261 and 231-2 Northamptonshire: Northants 347-6 v Derbyshire 377 “It
  ‘as to hit the bat,” heckles a man in the crowd as Sandhu appeals for a caught
  behind against Revis. Revis survives to pick up a hugely impressive third
  successive ton in CC matches. He pulls off his helmet, raises his bat, gets a
  huge hug from George Hill and smiles. He is applauded off the field, by
  spectators and Sussex players, George Hill, 73 not out, lagging deliberately
  behind. Meanwhile at OT, Carlson sits unbeaten on 106, Northeast on 84 – the
  Glamorgan lead hurtling towards 400. Justin Broad will nibble nervously on his
  sandwiches, one run short of his hundred, but he’s taken Northants to within
  30 runs of Derbyshire. Lunch round most of the grounds, scores to follow.
  Justin Broad and Rob Keogh are ushering Northants to parity and beyond at
  Wantage Road – in fact Broad is just three short of his hundred… While
  Yorkshire smack Sussex all over Scarborough, things have just got underway at
  New Road, where Sonny Baker has almost immediately sent Adam Hose on his way
  for 82. Lancashire’s bad evening has been followed by a bad morning.
  Glamorgan’s Sam Northeast and Kiran Carlson have added 100 runs and ye
  glorious Chris Green has come in for a particular tonking. Glamorgan lead by
  321. Here is that Clark on Clark bouncer – sadly the footage stops before
  Jordan goes to give Graham a big get well soon kiss (possibly). George Hill
  lofts Jack Carson out of the ground and into the garden of the air bnb where
  the Yorkshire marketing man is staying. More from Hoppsy in the north east:
  The ladies setting up the bookstall to raise funds for the Durham academy were
  not overly confident before start of play. “We’ll be open at lunch if the game
  is still going,” one said. Hopefully, they are not also running the Academy’s
  positive-thinking sessions. Their pessimism has been unfounded as Durham have
  negotiated the first hour - including the taking of the second new ball -
  without mishap. Well, not entirely without mishap: Graham Clark, who has been
  leading the resistance, has been clunked on the grill of the helmet by his
  older brother, Jordan. That led to a change of helmet and some studying of the
  pitch from the umpires. This pitch has flattened out, and very little is
  misbehaving, but these days umpires faced by a five-minute delay have to look
  businesslike. They can’t just get a crossword out of their pocket. In the big
  game at Trent Bridge, Somerset have just made a breakthrough. Lewis Gregory
  sending Joe Clarke on his way for 42 after a hundred partnership with Haseeb
  Hameed – still there on 125. Notts still trail by 203 and will need to slam
  their big white cricket boots down if they are to get a win out of this.
  Apologies, briefly distracted by looking at garden furniture. Let’s go around
  the grounds – first to CLS where Surrey have taken the new ball and Jordan
  Clark is playing the Overton challenge, and has hit brother Graham on the
  grill. More on this from Hoppsy later. They’re up and running at Chelmsford
  and Canterbury – where Kent – buttressed by Ben Compton - had an unexpectedly
  good Wednesday against Leicestershire. Fifty for Revis – who the Yorkshire
  cognoscenti consider to be the best of the batting bunch (though I feel I’ve
  written that about various others in the top five over the last few years).
  The Yorks lead is currently 113 and you’d think they’ll bat till tea if they
  last the course. Our man with the battered suitcase has arrived at Chester le
  Street. Here Hoppsy raises a – deserved - glass to Surrey. “It’s time to give
  thanks for Surrey. A risky assertion perhaps as they have never been
  universally popular, but they set the standards for county cricket and
  everybody should be grateful for that. Sure, it’s easier with a turnover of
  £65m but if they secure four successive titles to emulate their feat under
  Stuart Surridge in 1955 it will be a considerable achievement. Surridge
  inherited a bat company and the bats were emblazoned with his initials. Rory
  Burns, the current captain, is selling a bit of promotional kit for his
  testimonial year (bucket hats a speciality) so who knows, perhaps he will get
  the bug too. Durham‘s lead is only 53 with five wickets left and, although the
  pitch is showing signs of spin, Surrey will be confident that they can wrap
  this one up by tea. More than any other county, Surrey still regard the
  Championship as an event and their crowds have risen as a result. They also
  oppose the abominable idea of a conference system which once again this summer
  has reared its ugly head. The unstated energy behind this is that it would
  reduce the number of Championship matches but some naive counties are seduced
  by the notion that all 18 teams would start the season with a chance of
  winning the title. The fact is that Surrey are so far ahead of some of their
  rivals they have no right to be playing each other. Pyramid systems are
  healthy. So well done to Surrey – and now I have said that they will probably
  lose entirely unexpectedly. Delayed starts at Canterbury, Chelmsford, New Road
  and unlucky Cheltenham. The Met Office promises that the rain is moving south
  east – and may may hit the Test - turning to hail if you’re really lucky
  later. Sussex have taken the new ball – and almost immediately collect a
  wicket, Harry Duke is gobbled up by the keeper off Hudson-Prentice. Yorks 293
  for five. The next man in is Will Sutherland, who went surfing last night off
  North Bay with twelfth man Dan Moriarty. There’s a great picture on the
  Yorkshire CCC website. Also a restaurant recommendation from last night – a
  fabulous Italian called Tricolos. Lovely pizza and a very drinkable glass of
  house red. The umpires walk out to the middle at North Marine Road, and they
  are only just behind at The Oval. India are without Jasprit Bumrah, and Taha
  is on the OBO. Follow it here (but do drop back in with us for a sandwich).
  After 356 matches and over 15,000 runs, Gloucestershire stalwart Chris Dent
  has announced his retirement. He passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season
  four times, most recently in 2019, when he led Gloucestershire to Division
  One. “I want to thank Gloucestershire CCC for giving me my opportunity 16
  years ago,” he said. “The support and faith you’ve shown me have been a huge
  part of any success I’ve had over the years.” “To the fans - your
  encouragement throughout my career has meant everything. What stands out most,
  especially over these last few difficult years, is the love and kindness
  you’ve shown me. That support helped me more than you’ll ever know. “The
  biggest thank you goes to all the players. You guys are what made the last 16
  years so memorable. I feel incredibly lucky to have shared the field with so
  many brilliant people. When I look back on my career, my favourite memories
  are special because of the people I shared them with.” Gloucestershire head
  coach Mark Alleyne said: “Batting at the top for most of his career in England
  is an unenviable task, but once again he managed to impact games from that
  position on a regular basis. His presence there kept him perennially in
  England’s shortlist, though he never quite got the call. I believe the
  international stage could have seen him flourish. “Although still in great
  physical shape, it has been more challenging mentally, and on that sad note,
  his appearances have been somewhat restricted. “The last few years will not
  define what has been a stellar career with the Glorious, and I would like to
  thank him for his immense contributions over the years.” Wishing him a happy
  and fulfilled future. Yorkshire’s Adam Lyth zinged to his fifth first-class
  century, nimble as the weasel that darted about Anne Brontë’s grave in the
  morning sun. The Scarborough faithful delighted in his innings and his passage
  past a thousand runs for the summer, as they did in James Wharton’s seventh
  fifty – though he once more missed out on a hundred, shuffling away after
  being bowled for 85. With a lead of 70 over Sussex, Yorkshire are well placed
  in what feels like a must-win game to avoid relegation. Emilio Gay’s sparkling
  99 gave Durham an outside chance of causing the leaders, Surrey, a few
  headaches, though two late wickets stacked the equation southwards. The
  morning session at Chester-le-Street was taken up by Surrey hot-trotting
  another 140 runs, spearheaded by Jordan Clark’s 82; Ben Raine finished with
  five for 72. Meanwhile Nottinghamshire kept in the game at Trent Bridge,
  thanks to a third century of the season from Haseeb Hameed – who also passed
  1,000 runs. Somerset lost seven for 100 in a hurry. Kent defied
  Leicestershire, built largely by an unbeaten 101 from Ben Compton, another
  1,000-run graduate. Earlier Tom Scriven missed out on his first first-class
  century by one run. Jimmy Anderson’s 43rd birthday present from his Lancashire
  teammates was a collapse of seven wickets for 30 at Old Trafford as
  Glamorgan’s Mason Crane collected six for 19. Essex piled up 602 for six
  declared against Warwickshire, with hundreds from Charlie Allison, Tom Westley
  and Michael Pepper. Half-centuries from Luke Procter, George Bartlett and
  Justin Broad kept Northants in the game against Derbyshire. Middlesex are on
  top against Gloucestershire, Kane Williamson collecting 153. And an unbeaten
  partnership of 126 between Jake Libby and Adam Hose steadied Worcestershire
  against Hampshire at New Road. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Durham 153 and
  222-5 v Surrey 322 Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire 140-2 Trent
  Bridge: Nottinghamshire 189-2 v Somerset 438 New Road: Worcestershire 187-2 v
  Hampshire 293 Scarborough: Yorkshire 292-4 v Sussex 222 DIVISION TWO
  Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 Canterbury: Kent 203-3 v
  Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 v Glamorgan 261 and 95-2
  Northamptonshire: Northants 265-5 v Derbyshire 377 Hello from the north
  Yorkshire coast. The Scarborough micro-climate continues to be kind, and the
  players are all out in the middle stretching this and that. A morning walk
  around Marine Drive has given me an excellent potted history of Scarborough
  thanks to some “portholes in time”. The most interesting of many interesting
  facts is that in 1253 Henry III granted the town a royal charter to hold an
  annual summer fair for 45 days. It was the biggest fair in Western Europe and
  inspired the traditional love ballad Scarborough Fair. I’ll stop there before
  I get embroiled in secret wireless stations and 11,000 year-old archaeological
  remains. Play starts at 11am here, and around the grounds. Come dip your toe
  in, the water is lovely.

Surrey went clear of the rest at Chester-le-Street, a three-day win against Durham that puts them in prime position to swan gracefully in and collect their fourth Championship on the trot, with just three matches left in the season. India’s tall, elegant, slow left-armer Sai Kishore did exactly what he was signed for, zinging the Kookaburra through Durham, finishing with five for 72. Meanwhile Jordan Clark gave the Overtons a run for their money by hitting younger brother Graham, who had batted very nicely for 42, on the grill with a stinging bouncer. Surrey, needing 176 for victory, had a mild wobble when they lost Ryan Patel and Rory Burns in consecutive overs, but 40 from Sam Curran set the sails fair. Things don’t look so rosy for Durham who, if Yorkshire win on Friday, have their boots in the relegation zone. Durham must also ride disquiet from members, who were unhappy to be told at an evening forum that the club would be voting for a conference structure for 2026. Nottinghamshire, who were sitting on Surrey’s coat-tails before this round, look certain to slip further behind despite a wonderful 208 from Haseeb Hameed, which made him the leading run-scorer in Division One. With the game still marooned in the first innings, and Somerset bowling with a 151-over ball, a draw seems inevitable. Matthew Revis danced to his third century in July, his unbeaten 152 putting Yorkshire in a dominant position at North Marine Road. Sussex, 323 runs behind on first-innings, made a dog’s breakfast of the start of their second, perhaps unnerved by the bangs coming from the naval warfare re-enactment at nearby Peasholm Park – three times a week in the school holidays. Imam-ul-Haq’s swooping run out and throw-down from extra cover to dismiss Tom Alsop would have had uncle Inzamam’s approval, if from the sofa. Unbeaten fifties from Daniel Hughes and Danial Ibrahim gave Sussex something to chew on overnight. Centuries from Justin Broad and Rob Keogh bulldozed Northants to 550-9dec, weary Derbyshire then lost four wickets. Sonny Baker’s five wickets for Hampshire will have given his Lions’ tour prospects a boost, Jake Libby propped up Worcestershire with an unbeaten 100. Nightwatchman Ethan Bamber flew to his first first-class century and helped Warwickshire avoid the follow-on at Chelmsford. And Lancashire had a bad day at Old Trafford, finishing with half the side out and 247 runs needed. Just 9.5 overs were possible at Canterbury and there was no play at Cheltenham. The covers are on, the massive seagulls chew sea-monsters out of the outfield, time for me to head home. Thanks for your lovely company – till tomorrow, good bye! DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT Durham 153 and 344 by five wickets. Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire 465-9 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 511-6 v Somerset 438 New Road: Worcestershire 249 v Hampshire 293 and 139-2 Scarborough: Yorkshire 545-9dec v Sussex 222 and 115-3 DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 play abandoned for the day Canterbury: Kent 217-3 v Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 and 226-5 v Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec Northamptonshire: Northants 550-9dec v Derbyshire 377 and 52-4 Chester-le-Street: Surrey 322 and 176-5 BEAT Durham 153 and 344 by five wickets. The reigning champions go clear. Durham 3 points; Surrey 21. I suppose I’d better write up for the paper, with Dom Bess wheeling in from the Trafalgar Square end, his knees grass-stain free, the sun in full regalia. Do keep an eye on things BTL. That Imam run-out and rather joyous celebration. Play will resume at 5.30 at Canterbury. While bad light has stopped play at Chester le Street, with Surrey 135 for three, 41 runs from victory. Hoppsy thinks that will be that for the day, and CCLive! thanks him for his whimsy and hard-nosed reporting of the Durham member’s meeting. Hoppsy with the penultimate chapter from Chester le Street. The floodlights are on at The Riverside and there is a spark of life in this game. Surrey have lost 3 for 94 in pursuit of 176. Dom Sibley’s pained 35 from 47 balls with a runner is looking invaluable after the loss of two more wickets in successive overs - Ryan Patel mistiming a pull against Mattie Potts and Rory Burns stumped when he advanced to Callum Parkinson and didn’t get into the same parish. You could have got a parish church and team of bell ringers in between him and the ball. Surrey want to finish this tonight and in theory they have ample time (18 overs plus the extra half-hour) and wickets to do it, but the clouds are glowering and the floodlights beaming down. There is some turn for Parkinson, who has not had many opportunities this summer, was loaned out to Worcestershire for one match, and looks to be a rounder figure than when I last saw him. Can he turn it around? A third double century of the season for Haseeb Hameed, given out lying prone on his stomach after a calamity running mix-up for 208, and Notts have now drawn level with Somerset, with five first-innings wicket in hand. HH is now the leading run-scorer in Division One. Rob Keogh left high and mighty on 125. Reece 3-114. The lead over Derbyshire is 173, let’s see if they can make a better fist of things than Sussex have. I report a Surrey wobble. Maybe a sway? Two quick wickets – Patel and Burns in consecutive overs – 65 needed, seven wickets in hand. Back on at Scarborough, where Ibrahim is lucky to survive a corker from Sutherland and a diving Matthew Revis at gully – who seems to hurt something in the process and walks off for running repairs. It is fabulous that Scarborough CC provide a drinking water tap, just a shame it is located right outside the open window of the gents…also appreciate the miniature olive tree in a pot brought along for authenticity by the Souvlaki stall. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Durham 153 and 344 v Surrey 322 and 64-1 Surrey need 112 to win Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire 313-5 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 387-4 v Somerset 438 New Road: Worcestershire 249 v Hampshire 293 Scarborough: Yorkshire 545-9dec v Sussex 222 and 29-3 DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 play abandoned for the day Canterbury: Kent 217-3 v Leicestershire 471 rain Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 and 5-1 v Glamorgan 261 and 348-7dec Northamptonshire: Northants 516-7 v Derbyshire 377 Lancashire have safely negotiated the first ball of their chase. Sussex have calmed down and, an absolute run fest at Wantage Road when I wasn’t looking – Justin Broad has just been out for 171 and Rob Keogh has 113 after a barren season. Northants lead Derbys by 137. Everywhere else it is tea – scores to follow. And five wickets for Sonny Baker – at just the sort of time that might get him selected for a Lions Tour. Worcestershire all out 249, 44 short of Hampshire. Those five wickets for the Lancashire spinners, won’t trouble Mason six for 19 Crane too much. Congratulations to Sam Northeast, 132, and Kiran Carlson, 108. Be good if they could keep things going till tomorrow when I’m supposed to be going to OT. And another, next ball! Milnes steams in and Coles wafts with an angle and edges to third slip. Off he slopes, and Sussex are 20 for three. What are Sussex doing?! A fabulous, swooping, pick-up and throw-down by Imam-ul-Haq at extra cover. Uncle Inzy would nod in approval, from the safety of the sofa. After a farcical run out chance/overthrow, Jack White takes an excellent caught and bowled to send Tom Haines back to the pavilion for seven. As background, a naval re-enactment at Peasholm Park occassionally interrupts to disturb the seagulls. And an email, hello there Phil Russell. “At the risk of jinxing it, not sure if anyone else has noted Ethan Bamber has gone past 50 for the first time and is closing in on a maiden ton. He went in as night watchman last night for Warwickshire v Essex to protect Zen Malik (golden duck today). Pitch seems to be a road so might not get a better shot at it!” Currently on 82, Warwicks 280-4, 322 behind Essex. Three wickets for Sonny Baker at New Road, three slips for Jack White at Scarborough. Worcestershire are 56 short of Hampshire with two wickets left, and not yet half way through their match as the Yorkshire faithful turn to the final chapter. Jake Libby 93 not out. More from CLS, where Hoppsy is watching the one game that will finish today. The ECB hopes that use of the Kookaburra will encourage the development of spin bowling, but it has also caused counties to scour the globe for short-term overseas signings to mask their deficiencies. Sai Kishore has been an excellent two-match acquisition for Surrey and his return of 41.4-12-72-5 helped dismiss Durham for 344. Kishore, mop-haired, tall and dignified, skippers Tamil Nadu in India’s red-ball competition and has a feel of Ravindra Jadeja about him. He found occasional turn, but it was his relentless accuracy and insistent line that most impressed. He ended the innings thanks to a diving catch at short extra by Ryan Patel. It left Surrey needing 176 for victory, a target that feels very much attainable. Dom Sibley, who tweaked a groin in the field, is coming out to bat with a runner. Sibley with a runner feels more advantageous than Sibley acting as a runner, which does not bear thinking about. By the way, the steward on Gate 6 is a bit of a card. The car in front of me this morning approached a wide-open gate as if it was the narrowest entrance in Christendom. “When’s your re-test then?” joshed the steward. An exchange not immediately found in the Spectator Management manual, but it gave me a guilty smirk. As Revis passes 150, a standing ovation from the packed pavilion. Yorkshire lead by 323 and Sussex must bat for pretty much the rest of the match to escape with a draw. After Shane Snater’s two in two after lunch, Warwickshire have reverted to run accumulation at Chelmsford. They’re 253-4, still 200-odd short of the follow on. Bamber 76 not out. At CLS, Tom Lawes is a runner for Dom Sibley, something which has been outlawed in international games since 2011. As a like for like pair of legs, Sibley has done well. … five for Sai Kishore at CLS; while Notts still trail Somerset by 117 – HH 162 not out, Jack Haynes 55 not out. No evidence here meaning no data. I feel like the Hundred probably has attracted new fans to other forms of cricket. Surely?! Though a source close to CCLive! suggests that the advertising might run only one way. Has anyone ever attended a Hundred match and seen advertising for Championship/one day cup cricket? An important message from Richard Gould in the last par to those counties who can feel the new money burning in their pocket. Frustrations, frustrations. Gloucestershire are so often stymied by the rain. Just one innings completed in three days. Wishing them peerless sunshine and a full house tomorrow. I was listening to the BBC’s Americast and Gloucestershire supporter wrote in to invite Anthony Zurcher to support the club, but also introduced the cast to the idea of Major League cricket. Zurcher plumped for Texas Super Kings over Washington Freedom, who lost to Mumbai Indians New York in the July final. Hopps listens in to the Durham members’ meeting. Praise earlier for Surrey’s opposition to the conference proposal for the Championship leads neatly to Durham, who are one of its chief proponents. Durham had their members meeting last night and informed them that they were voting for a three-division conference whatever the feedback. That has brought a predictable outcry on cricket forums. One member compared the meeting to a communist stitch-up with the result known in advance, another complained “ the first few tables are full of party apparatchiks and happy clappers.” Durham like the suggestion that all 18 counties can potentially win the title when the season begins, but the argument seems to be turning against them. This match is also turning against them. They have just lost the seventh wicket, Codi Yuduf caught at the wicket. A wicket each today for Sai Kishore and, earlier, Dan Lawrence. The lead is 147. Surrey should start worrying a little at what? 240? Spent 15 minutes of my lunch time sitting on a bench looking down on the surfers, dawdlers and dogs of North Bay. I’m a lucky girl. Oh dear, with a century daydreamable, George Hill swipes at Henry Crocombe and edges up in the air and down to mid on. Yorkshire 460 for seven. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Durham 153 and 305-6 v Surrey 322 Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire 202-2 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 271-3 v Somerset 438 New Road: Worcestershire 191-5 v Hampshire 293 Scarborough: Yorkshire 453-6 v Sussex 222 DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 no play before lunch Canterbury: Kent 217-3 v Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 v Glamorgan 261 and 231-2 Northamptonshire: Northants 347-6 v Derbyshire 377 “It ‘as to hit the bat,” heckles a man in the crowd as Sandhu appeals for a caught behind against Revis. Revis survives to pick up a hugely impressive third successive ton in CC matches. He pulls off his helmet, raises his bat, gets a huge hug from George Hill and smiles. He is applauded off the field, by spectators and Sussex players, George Hill, 73 not out, lagging deliberately behind. Meanwhile at OT, Carlson sits unbeaten on 106, Northeast on 84 – the Glamorgan lead hurtling towards 400. Justin Broad will nibble nervously on his sandwiches, one run short of his hundred, but he’s taken Northants to within 30 runs of Derbyshire. Lunch round most of the grounds, scores to follow. Justin Broad and Rob Keogh are ushering Northants to parity and beyond at Wantage Road – in fact Broad is just three short of his hundred… While Yorkshire smack Sussex all over Scarborough, things have just got underway at New Road, where Sonny Baker has almost immediately sent Adam Hose on his way for 82. Lancashire’s bad evening has been followed by a bad morning. Glamorgan’s Sam Northeast and Kiran Carlson have added 100 runs and ye glorious Chris Green has come in for a particular tonking. Glamorgan lead by 321. Here is that Clark on Clark bouncer – sadly the footage stops before Jordan goes to give Graham a big get well soon kiss (possibly). George Hill lofts Jack Carson out of the ground and into the garden of the air bnb where the Yorkshire marketing man is staying. More from Hoppsy in the north east: The ladies setting up the bookstall to raise funds for the Durham academy were not overly confident before start of play. “We’ll be open at lunch if the game is still going,” one said. Hopefully, they are not also running the Academy’s positive-thinking sessions. Their pessimism has been unfounded as Durham have negotiated the first hour - including the taking of the second new ball - without mishap. Well, not entirely without mishap: Graham Clark, who has been leading the resistance, has been clunked on the grill of the helmet by his older brother, Jordan. That led to a change of helmet and some studying of the pitch from the umpires. This pitch has flattened out, and very little is misbehaving, but these days umpires faced by a five-minute delay have to look businesslike. They can’t just get a crossword out of their pocket. In the big game at Trent Bridge, Somerset have just made a breakthrough. Lewis Gregory sending Joe Clarke on his way for 42 after a hundred partnership with Haseeb Hameed – still there on 125. Notts still trail by 203 and will need to slam their big white cricket boots down if they are to get a win out of this. Apologies, briefly distracted by looking at garden furniture. Let’s go around the grounds – first to CLS where Surrey have taken the new ball and Jordan Clark is playing the Overton challenge, and has hit brother Graham on the grill. More on this from Hoppsy later. They’re up and running at Chelmsford and Canterbury – where Kent – buttressed by Ben Compton - had an unexpectedly good Wednesday against Leicestershire. Fifty for Revis – who the Yorkshire cognoscenti consider to be the best of the batting bunch (though I feel I’ve written that about various others in the top five over the last few years). The Yorks lead is currently 113 and you’d think they’ll bat till tea if they last the course. Our man with the battered suitcase has arrived at Chester le Street. Here Hoppsy raises a – deserved - glass to Surrey. “It’s time to give thanks for Surrey. A risky assertion perhaps as they have never been universally popular, but they set the standards for county cricket and everybody should be grateful for that. Sure, it’s easier with a turnover of £65m but if they secure four successive titles to emulate their feat under Stuart Surridge in 1955 it will be a considerable achievement. Surridge inherited a bat company and the bats were emblazoned with his initials. Rory Burns, the current captain, is selling a bit of promotional kit for his testimonial year (bucket hats a speciality) so who knows, perhaps he will get the bug too. Durham‘s lead is only 53 with five wickets left and, although the pitch is showing signs of spin, Surrey will be confident that they can wrap this one up by tea. More than any other county, Surrey still regard the Championship as an event and their crowds have risen as a result. They also oppose the abominable idea of a conference system which once again this summer has reared its ugly head. The unstated energy behind this is that it would reduce the number of Championship matches but some naive counties are seduced by the notion that all 18 teams would start the season with a chance of winning the title. The fact is that Surrey are so far ahead of some of their rivals they have no right to be playing each other. Pyramid systems are healthy. So well done to Surrey – and now I have said that they will probably lose entirely unexpectedly. Delayed starts at Canterbury, Chelmsford, New Road and unlucky Cheltenham. The Met Office promises that the rain is moving south east – and may may hit the Test - turning to hail if you’re really lucky later. Sussex have taken the new ball – and almost immediately collect a wicket, Harry Duke is gobbled up by the keeper off Hudson-Prentice. Yorks 293 for five. The next man in is Will Sutherland, who went surfing last night off North Bay with twelfth man Dan Moriarty. There’s a great picture on the Yorkshire CCC website. Also a restaurant recommendation from last night – a fabulous Italian called Tricolos. Lovely pizza and a very drinkable glass of house red. The umpires walk out to the middle at North Marine Road, and they are only just behind at The Oval. India are without Jasprit Bumrah, and Taha is on the OBO. Follow it here (but do drop back in with us for a sandwich). After 356 matches and over 15,000 runs, Gloucestershire stalwart Chris Dent has announced his retirement. He passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season four times, most recently in 2019, when he led Gloucestershire to Division One. “I want to thank Gloucestershire CCC for giving me my opportunity 16 years ago,” he said. “The support and faith you’ve shown me have been a huge part of any success I’ve had over the years.” “To the fans - your encouragement throughout my career has meant everything. What stands out most, especially over these last few difficult years, is the love and kindness you’ve shown me. That support helped me more than you’ll ever know. “The biggest thank you goes to all the players. You guys are what made the last 16 years so memorable. I feel incredibly lucky to have shared the field with so many brilliant people. When I look back on my career, my favourite memories are special because of the people I shared them with.” Gloucestershire head coach Mark Alleyne said: “Batting at the top for most of his career in England is an unenviable task, but once again he managed to impact games from that position on a regular basis. His presence there kept him perennially in England’s shortlist, though he never quite got the call. I believe the international stage could have seen him flourish. “Although still in great physical shape, it has been more challenging mentally, and on that sad note, his appearances have been somewhat restricted. “The last few years will not define what has been a stellar career with the Glorious, and I would like to thank him for his immense contributions over the years.” Wishing him a happy and fulfilled future. Yorkshire’s Adam Lyth zinged to his fifth first-class century, nimble as the weasel that darted about Anne Brontë’s grave in the morning sun. The Scarborough faithful delighted in his innings and his passage past a thousand runs for the summer, as they did in James Wharton’s seventh fifty – though he once more missed out on a hundred, shuffling away after being bowled for 85. With a lead of 70 over Sussex, Yorkshire are well placed in what feels like a must-win game to avoid relegation. Emilio Gay’s sparkling 99 gave Durham an outside chance of causing the leaders, Surrey, a few headaches, though two late wickets stacked the equation southwards. The morning session at Chester-le-Street was taken up by Surrey hot-trotting another 140 runs, spearheaded by Jordan Clark’s 82; Ben Raine finished with five for 72. Meanwhile Nottinghamshire kept in the game at Trent Bridge, thanks to a third century of the season from Haseeb Hameed – who also passed 1,000 runs. Somerset lost seven for 100 in a hurry. Kent defied Leicestershire, built largely by an unbeaten 101 from Ben Compton, another 1,000-run graduate. Earlier Tom Scriven missed out on his first first-class century by one run. Jimmy Anderson’s 43rd birthday present from his Lancashire teammates was a collapse of seven wickets for 30 at Old Trafford as Glamorgan’s Mason Crane collected six for 19. Essex piled up 602 for six declared against Warwickshire, with hundreds from Charlie Allison, Tom Westley and Michael Pepper. Half-centuries from Luke Procter, George Bartlett and Justin Broad kept Northants in the game against Derbyshire. Middlesex are on top against Gloucestershire, Kane Williamson collecting 153. And an unbeaten partnership of 126 between Jake Libby and Adam Hose steadied Worcestershire against Hampshire at New Road. DIVISION ONE Chester-le-Street: Durham 153 and 222-5 v Surrey 322 Chelmsford: Essex 602-6dec v Warwickshire 140-2 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 189-2 v Somerset 438 New Road: Worcestershire 187-2 v Hampshire 293 Scarborough: Yorkshire 292-4 v Sussex 222 DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 54-1 v Middlesex 445 Canterbury: Kent 203-3 v Leicestershire 471 Old Trafford: Lancashire 137 v Glamorgan 261 and 95-2 Northamptonshire: Northants 265-5 v Derbyshire 377 Hello from the north Yorkshire coast. The Scarborough micro-climate continues to be kind, and the players are all out in the middle stretching this and that. A morning walk around Marine Drive has given me an excellent potted history of Scarborough thanks to some “portholes in time”. The most interesting of many interesting facts is that in 1253 Henry III granted the town a royal charter to hold an annual summer fair for 45 days. It was the biggest fair in Western Europe and inspired the traditional love ballad Scarborough Fair. I’ll stop there before I get embroiled in secret wireless stations and 11,000 year-old archaeological remains. Play starts at 11am here, and around the grounds. Come dip your toe in, the water is lovely.
