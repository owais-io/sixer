  Convicted rapist Gareth Ward is expected to be expelled from the New South
  Wales parliament on Friday after failing in his court bid to stop it. Ward,
  the MP for Kiama, faced the urgent hearing in the court of appeal on Thursday
  after he sought an injunction against the leader of the Legislative Assembly,
  Ron Hoenig, to stop his parliamentary colleagues expelling him. He commenced
  the proceedings on Monday night via his lawyers from Silverwater jail, where
  he has been remanded pending sentencing in September. Ward was found guilty in
  July of sexually abusing two young men in 2013 and 2015. He is appealing
  against his convictions, which include three counts of indecent assault and
  one for sexual intercourse without consent. Chief justice Andrew Bell oversaw
  the case alongside Justice Anna Mitchelmore and Justice Jeremy Kirk. Bell, who
  delivered the judgment, said he rejected the arguments put forward by Ward’s
  lawyers, saying the “notice of intention to appeal does not affect the power
  of the assembly to expel him”. “There was no evidence to support the assertion
  that a resolution to expel the plaintiff would be punitive in scope,” Bell
  said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Soon after the judgment was delivered
  the government ruled out moving a motion on Thursday night, but was expected
  to move to expel him on Friday when the Legislative Assembly sits. It was
  expected to be carried unanimously, or near unanimously, with both the Minns
  Labor government and the opposition indicating that they would support it.
  Ward’s injunction had triggered a potential constitutional showdown after
  Hoenig told reporters on Tuesday the government did not believe the court had
  the constitutional power to restrain the parliament or any member from moving
  a motion in the lower house. The hearing was then brought forward by a day
  after an urgent application by the parliament. During the hearing, Ward’s
  lawyer, Peter King, accused the parliament of trying to conduct a “kangaroo
  court” and said it was among a number of reasons why parliament’s resolution
  to expel Ward was “punitive in nature”. He further argued it was punitive
  because Ward’s expulsion would trigger a byelection and “he’s further punished
  in that respect, by losing the opportunity to regain his seat”. King later
  compared Ward’s absence from parliament to someone who has a “serious malady
  or illness or cancer or something” and cannot attend parliament for nine
  months. King also told the court that Ward’s convictions cannot alone be
  considered the “unworthy conduct” needed as grounds to expel him from
  parliament. “It’s not, in our respectful submission, justice according to law
  to say to someone, ‘well you’ve been convicted, we’re now going to punish you
  by expelling you from the parliament’,” he said. “We submit that the [common
  law] privilege doesn’t work that way.” Craig Lenehan SC, who appeared on
  behalf of Hoenig, disputed this. “It’s obviously open to a legislative body to
  form a view that a member convicted by a jury of a serious sex offence should
  be expelled,” he told the court. He also disputed that the motion to expel
  Ward was “some sort of illicit punitive purpose”, arguing there was no
  evidence of this. King told the court the parliament should at least hold off
  until after 19 September, when Ward was due to be sentenced. “If he’s
  acquitted,” he said, referring to the fact the matter was now under appeal,
  “and he’s lost all the rights that an innocent man would otherwise have, his
  career has been trashed.” The only option for Ward now would be an appeal to
  the high court. The parliament has power to expel a member if it is necessary
  to maintain the integrity of the parliament and to protect itself. It can
  expel a member for “unworthy conduct” that would tend to undermine the
  parliament’s reputation in the eyes of the public. But it cannot exercise the
  power to punish a member. Ward argued that expulsion was punitive because it
  would trigger a byelection he would be further punished by losing the
  opportunity to regain his seat.
