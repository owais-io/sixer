  A New Zealand woman and her six-year-old son, who were held for more than
  three weeks at a US immigration centre after being detained crossing the
  Canada-US border, have been released. In a short update on Saturday, the
  woman’s friend Victoria Besancon said Sarah Shaw and her son were safely home.
  The family would be taking some time to settle in before speaking about their
  experience, she added. Shaw, 33, who has lived in Washington state for just
  over three years, was detained with her son when they attempted to re-enter
  the US after dropping her two eldest children at Vancouver airport on 24 July,
  so they could fly to New Zealand for a holiday with their grandparents. Shaw’s
  father, Rod Price, told Radio New Zealand: “She went to go back across into
  the US and then I got a frantic call to say that she’s being detained and
  ‘they’re about to take my phone off me’ and ‘they’re locking me up for the
  night’.”. Besancon, who had helped to raise money for Shaw’s legal fight, said
  it had been a “terrifying” and “barbaric” ordeal for her friend. “Sarah
  thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon told the Guardian this week. “They
  didn’t really explain anything to her at first, they just kind of quietly took
  her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) confiscated Shaw’s phone and
  transported the mother and son to the Dilley immigration processing center in
  south Texas, many states away from her home, Besancon said. Foreign nationals
  caught up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown have similarly
  been transported to centres far from their homes, support networks and legal
  representation. An Ice spokesperson said: “The Dilley detention center is
  retrofitted for families. Adults with children are housed in facilities that
  provide for their safety, security and medical needs.” They added that
  “parents, who are here illegally, can take control of their departure” by
  self-deporting through a government-issued app. Shaw is on a “combo card”
  visa, made up of an employment visa, which she obtained through her employment
  at a maximum security juvenile facility, and an I-360 visa, which can grant
  immigration status to domestic violence survivors. Shaw had recently received
  a letter confirming her visa renewal, not realising that the I-360 element of
  her visa was still pending approval. “It wasn’t until she tried to come back
  across the border that she realised only half of the combination card –
  because it’s only one physical card – had been fully approved,” said Besancon.
  “It has been absolutely horrible,” Besancon said, adding that aside from the
  staff, Shaw and her son were the only English speakers. She said they were
  locked in their shared bedroom from 8pm to 8am and not allowed to wear their
  own clothes. A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said:
  “When someone with an expired parole leaves the country and tries to re-enter
  the US, they will be stopped in compliance with our laws and regulations. If
  they are accompanied by a minor, CBP will follow all protocols to keep
  families together or arrange care with a legal guardian. Immigration law will
  be enforced, and our officers and agents will act accordingly.” Shaw’s case is
  the latest in a growing list of foreigners facing interrogation, detention and
  deportations at the US border, including a British tourist, three Germans
  Lucas Sielaff, Fabian Schmidt and Jessica Brösche, and a Canadian and an
  Australian who were each held and then deported, despite having valid work
  visas. The union representing Shaw, the Washington Federation of State
  Employees, had called for her release. “The trauma this has already caused for
  her and her son may never be healed,” said Mike Yestramski, the union’s
  president and a psychiatric social worker at Western State hospital.
