  As he breaks three eggs into a glass bowl, Lt Columbo tells Joanna Ferris:
  “I’m the worst cook in the world, but there’s one thing I do terrific, and
  that’s an omelette.” The episode is Murder By the Book, and Columbo has taken
  Joanna, the wife of murder victim Jim Ferris, home to save her from more
  relentless questioning by his colleagues. Of course, we already know it was
  Jim’s less talented writing partner, naughty Ken Franklin, who did it. At
  first, Joanna resists Columbo’s offer of something to eat, but he gently gets
  on with it, in his trademark raincoat: he cracks the eggs into a bowl, picks
  out a bit of shell that inadvertently falls into the bowl and asks Joanna
  where he can get a bowl for the empty shells balanced in his hands. It is a
  perfect scene and perfect Columbo: bumbling and absolutely certain, attentive
  to needs and tiny details. There is also an omelette in the Inspector Morse
  episode The Wench is Dead, made by DC Adrian Kershaw and served to Morse as
  they discuss the principles of detection and why the victim caught a boat.
  Morse notes that the omelette could have more paprika. I know this thanks to
  Chris Sullivan’s stupendous blog, which since 2014 has been keeping the Morse
  universe and author Colin Dexter’s legacy alive. Sullivan notes that this
  omelette is one of the few times we actually see Morse eat, although that is
  not to say we don’t see him at various tables, including with Dr Laura Hobson
  and a very nice looking bowl of pasta and bottle of wine in the same episode.
  There is no shortage of food consumed by my third favourite detective,
  although, rather disappointingly, no omelettes, or frittatas, so I turned to
  something that goes with an omelette, namely the pappanozza made by Salvo
  Montalbano’s housekeeper, Adelina. The book and episode – La gita a Tindari –
  is seasonally appropriate and Montalbano (who is investigating the mysterious
  bond that unites a couple and an unrelated man in the same violent death)
  comes home to find pappanozza – that is, potatoes and onions boiled until
  soft, then mashed with a fork and seasoned with salt, olive oil, strong
  vinegar and plenty of black pepper. Perfect summer food. My partner Vincenzo,
  who is Sicilian, but sadly not a detective, adds green beans to this
  champ-like-mix, which I find brilliant, but I acknowledge makes it a different
  dish, in case anyone was thinking of reporting us to the British consulate for
  crimes against Sicilian food and Andrea Calogero Camilleri. If you don’t fancy
  a three-egg omelette with paprika, this delicious mess of potatoes, green
  beans and onion is terrific with hard-boiled egg, tuna or sausages, at a table
  or on a lap in front of any of the three episodes mentioned. Potatoes, green
  beans and onion Serves 4 5 medium waxy potatoes 3 small onions 400g green
  beans, trimmed Salt and black pepper 4 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp red-wine vinegar
  1 pinch dried oregano Peel the potatoes and cut them in half. Cut the onions
  in half, then pull away the skins, leaving the roots intact so the onion
  halves hold together. Top and tail the beans and cut them in half, too.
  Working in a pan big enough to accommodate everything, cover the potatoes with
  water, add salt and bring to a steady boil for five minutes. Add the onions
  and continue cooking for 20 minutes, adding the beans after 10; by the end of
  the cooking, the potatoes should be tender to the point of a knife. Drain
  everything. Use scissors to snip away the onion roots, so the onion halves
  fall into bits, and put these in a shallow bowl along with the potatoes and
  beans. Use a fork to break up the potatoes and onions – how much you mash
  depends on what you fancy. Whisk the olive oil and vinegar with a pinch each
  of dried oregano and salt, then pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss
  well. Grind over a generous amount of black pepper and serve.
