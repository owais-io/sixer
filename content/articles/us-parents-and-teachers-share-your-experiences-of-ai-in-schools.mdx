  Students in grades K-12 have been invited by Melania Trump to take part in a
  nationwide contest designed to encourage the use of artificial intelligence
  (AI) tools to help solve community issues. The first lady wants students to
  “unleash their imagination and showcase the spirit of American innovation” by
  participating in the government-sponsored contest. We want to hear from
  parents and teachers on their experiences of AI in schools. How do you feel
  about it being used in education? Do you support it or are you against it? If
  you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service here
