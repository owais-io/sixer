  Hello, and welcome to TechScape. My Spotify playlists are undergoing a British
  invasion this week. Here’s what I’m listening to: PinkPantheress, Lola Young
  and Evita in London. Privileges with the president Donald Trump announced this
  week that two US chipmakers would tithe 15% of their revenue from sales in
  China to the US government. Paying for the license to sell to Chinese
  customers represents an unprecedented deal. My colleague Helen Davidson
  reports from Taipei: The chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US
  government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in return
  for export licences to the key market. The arrangement will lead to Nvidia
  giving 15% of its revenue from Chinese sales of its H20 chips, and AMD giving
  15% of revenue from Chinese sales of its MI308 chips, according to reports
  citing US officials. The H20 and MI308 chips were banned from sale to China in
  April, despite the lower-powered H20 being designed specifically to abide by
  restrictions introduced by the Biden administration. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen
  Huang, head of the most valuable company in the world at $4.44tn, has been
  lobbying the White House for months to open up sales in China, where the US
  still prohibits sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips over national security
  concerns. In July, Trump relaxed some restrictions imposed by Joe Biden’s
  administration. The deal with Nvidia and AMD seems as much about personally
  appealing to Trump as it does about generating revenue for the US government.
  The agreement has all the trappings of Trump entering into business with the
  chipmakers. In a way, it’s a version of a playbook other major tech companies
  have been trying out as Trump is dramatically changing the international
  business landscape. Apple announced a $100bn investment commitment in US
  manufacturing. CEO Tim Cook, who had made the journey to the White House
  himself, presented Trump with a glass trophy (including 24 karat gold base)
  designating the president a graduate of the Apple Manufacturing Academy,
  launched in Michigan the week prior. During his meeting with Cook, Trump said
  he would levy a 100% tariff on semiconductor chips, which could set both Apple
  and Nvidia back billions. However, the president said: “If you’re building in
  the United States of America, there’s no charge.” Both Nvidia and Apple are
  likely to be exempted from the tariffs. Each appears to have paid for the
  privilege – Apple with its domestic investment, Nvidia with its
  revenue-sharing agreement. OpenAI debuts GPT-5 OpenAI launched the new version
  of the artificial intelligence that underpins ChatGPT last week. There are
  quite a few aspects of the release to consider to understand it fully – what
  the company is saying, where the AI race between tech giants stands, the
  model’s new capabilities and pitfalls, the environmental impact – so I’ve
  rounded up the Guardian’s coverage of GPT-5 below. OpenAI said GPT-5 has
  marked improved coding and writing capabilities over its predecessor. My
  colleague Dan Milmo reports: OpenAI has claimed to have taken a “significant
  step” towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) with the launch of its
  latest upgrade to ChatGPT, but has admitted there are still “many things”
  missing in its quest to create a system able to do humans’ jobs. Sam Altman,
  OpenAI’s chief executive, called the model a “significant step forward” to
  achieving the theoretical state of AGI, which the startup defines as a highly
  autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work –
  or, in other words, can do their jobs. Read the full story on the unveiling of
  GPT-5: OpenAI says latest ChatGPT upgrade is big step forward but still can’t
  do humans’ jobs The race towards artificial general intelligence is running
  hot, with tech giants pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the
  technology, but like OpenAI, Google and Meta acknowledge they have not reached
  that goal yet. Dan Milmo and Dara Kerr report: “[It is] missing something
  quite important, many things quite important,” said Altman, such as the
  model’s inability to “continuously learn” even after its launch. In other
  words, these systems are impressive but they have yet to crack the autonomy
  that would allow them to do a full-time job. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg,
  chief executive of Facebook parent Meta, said development of superintelligence
  – another theoretical state of AI where a system far exceeds human cognitive
  abilities – is “now in sight”. Google’s AI unit on Tuesday outlined its next
  step to AGI by announcing an unreleased model that trains AIs to interact with
  a convincing simulation of the real world. Read the full story: ‘It’s missing
  something’: AGI, superintelligence and a race for the future How we know
  OpenAI’s new model is not an omniscient presence that will lord over all
  humanity: GPT-5 is making some goofy mistakes. It struggles with maps in a way
  a 10-year-old might. Per my colleague Josh Taylor: when Guardian Australia
  asked the latest model of ChatGPT to identify the number of Rs in Australia’s
  states and territories, it could identify those which did. But the AI also
  believed Northern Territory had just three Rs not five. When asked to produce
  it on a map, spelled the territory as “Northan Territor”. Read the full story:
  OpenAI unveils ChatGPT-5 and its hyped ‘PhD level’ intelligence struggled with
  basic spelling and geography GPT-5 is a more powerful model than its
  predecessor, meaning it will consume more resources to answer each query.
  Here’s what experts told Aisha Kehoe Down: “A more complex model like GPT-5
  consumes more power both during training and during inference. It’s also
  targeted at long thinking … I can safely say that it’s going to consume a lot
  more power than GPT-4,” said Rakesh Kumar, a professor at the University of
  Illinois, currently working on the energy consumption of computation and AI
  models. Given recent reports that ChatGPT handles 2.5bn requests a day, the
  total consumption of GPT-5 could reach the daily electricity demand of 1.5m US
  homes. Read the full story: OpenAI will not disclose GPT-5’s energy use. It
  could be higher than past models End of an era: AOL to discontinue its dial-up
  internet service after 30 years Surprise: AOL, formerly known as America
  Online, was still offering dial-up internet service in 2025. My colleague
  Edward Helmore reports: The hisses, pings and screeches that introduced
  millions of Americans to the nascent online world are to be formally retired
  when AOL’s dial-up internet shuts down in late September. At its peak in the
  late 1990s and early 2000s, AOL had over 23 million subscribers in the US,
  making it the dominant internet service provider at the time. Currently, only
  a small fraction of US households – about 175,000 – still rely on dial-up for
  internet access and web browser platforms. In 2013, Pew Research found that
  just 3% of American households used dial-up internet. The 2025 figure
  represents less than 0.5% of the current population. What once seemed
  ubiquitous in the US and UK is now a relic and only a partially important
  piece of the history of the internet. Many parts of the world that are now
  online never experienced – perhaps endured might be the more apt word –
  dial-up internet. They jumped straight to broadband, wifi or the mobile
  internet, a phenomenon known as technological leapfrogging. If you’re feeling
  nostalgic for the early days of the internet, though, you can listen to the
  classic, grating sound of dialing into the web via Wikipedia’s page on the
  subject. The wider TechScape TikTok to replace trust and safety team in
