  Sting has reportedly been sued by his former Police bandmates over alleged
  lost royalties from their hit song Every Breath You Take. In the suit, filed
  in London’s high court, guitarist Andy Summers and drummer Stewart Copeland
  claim they never received songwriting credits on the 1983 single. The pair
  also allege they have never been paid for their writing contributions. The
  case is said to have been listed under “general commercial contracts and
  arrangements”. Sting appears as a defendant under his real name, Gordon
  Matthew Sumner, along with his company, Magnetic Publishing Ltd. The Police
  formed in 1977 and achieved a US No 1 single with Every Breath You Take, which
  appears on the band’s fifth and final album, Synchronicity. It was the
  bestselling US single of 1983, the fifth bestselling of the decade and was
  sampled on P Diddy and Faith Evans’ 1997 song I’ll Be Missing You. The band
  also had chart success with Roxanne, Every Little Thing She Does is Magic and
  Don’t Stand So Close to Me before splitting in 1984. A spokesperson for Sting,
  73, denied the legal action was related to Every Breath You Take but did not
  elaborate on the case, the Sun reported. The Police have reunited on numerous
  occasions and, in 2023, launched an official TikTok account to mark the 40th
  anniversary of Synchronicity. Sting in 2021 said he regretted reforming the
  trio in 2007, calling the tour that followed “an exercise in nostalgia”. The
  musician explained at the time that he preferred being a solo artist due to
  the “total freedom” it offered. “It’s not a power thing at all; it’s just
  about producing exactly the brand and style of music that feels right for
  you,” he said. Sting in 2022 sold his entire songwriting catalogue to
  Universal for an estimated $300m (£246m). In June, the singer performed his
  greatest hits at the Isle of Wight festival including Message in a Bottle, An
  Englishman in New York, Walking on the Moon and Fragile. He also performed at
  the FireAid benefit in Inglewood, California, in January.
