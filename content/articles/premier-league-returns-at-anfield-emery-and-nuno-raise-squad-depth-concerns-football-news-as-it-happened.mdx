  Today’s news in brief … The new Premier League season kicks off tonight with
  the reigning champions Liverpool hosting Bournemouth at Anfield under the
  Friday night lights. Rute Cardoso, the wife of Diogo Jota, and the couple’s
  three children are expected to attend Liverpool’s first competitive game since
  the tragic summer passing of Jota and his brother, Andre Silva. Tributes to
  both men will be paid before the game. Howard Webb, the head of the PGMOL, has
  said that he sees no way back to refereeing for scandal-hit official David
  Coote, who was sacked last year. Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has said it
  is his belief the club can hold on to midfielder Carlos Baleba for another
  season despite strong interest from Manchester United. There has been “no
  change” to the stand-off involving Newcastle United and Alexander Isak,
  according the club’s head coach, Eddie Howe, who told reporters whatever
  happens next is out of his control but he can envisage a scenario where the
  on-strike striker plays for the club again. Bournemouth are closing in on a
  deal to sign the Liverpool forward Ben Doak for £25m and could even spirit the
  19-year-old Scot away from Anfield on their team coach after tonight’s match.
  Liverpool have just announced the signing of the 18-year-old centre-back
  Giovanni Leoni from Parma for an initial fee of £26m. Bayern Munich have
  opened talks with Chelsea over a deal for their out-of-favour forward
  Christopher Nkunku, who never really impressed during the limited
  opportunities afforded to him at Stamford Bridge in the past two years.
  Dominic Calvert-Lewin has become the latest target man to be plucked from the
  revolving carousel of No9s. The former Everton striker has joined Leeds on a
  free transfer in what could be a canny bit of business if the 28-year-old’s
  new employers can keep him out of the treatment room. Unai Emery reckons his
  Aston Villa team are “not a contender to be in the top seven” this season as
  their efforts at summer squad-maintenance and rebuilding are being hamstrung
  by profit and sustainability rules. And Nuno Espirito Santo’s first press
  conference of the season was a similar study in existential angst as the
  Nottingham Forest manager bemoaned the lack of sufficient additions to his
  squad ahead of a season in which the club will be competing in Europe for the
  first time in 30 years. Liverpool: While the Premier League champions look
  very well equipped for the season ahead, there are concerns about their lack
  of cover at centre-back should any misfortune on the injury front befall
  Virgil van Dijk or Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez is a fairly reliable option and
  in pre-season, both Andy Robertson and Ryan Gravenberch were called upon to
  put in shifts in the heart of Liverpool’s defence during friendlies. The good
  news for Liverpool fans is that Arne Slot has moved to allay any fears by
  signing the 18-year-old centre-back Giovanni Leoni from Parma for an initial
  £26m. He has signed a six-year contract and is regarded by the club as a
  potential long-term successor to Big Virgil. Leoni was the subject of interest
  from several clubs including Newcastle but will be at Anfield tonight to watch
  his new teammates kick off their Premier League campaign against Bournemouth.
  Read on … Manchester United: Ruben Amorim has been singing the praises of the
  club’s new striker Benjamin Sesko, who it seems has been making a good
  impression around the club’s new and improved Carrington training complex
  since his arrival from RB Leipzig. “He’s one guy who stays here, has lunch and
  goes to the medical department, does the stretching,” he said. “He is always
  thinking about football. He’s really obsessed about that and that is a good
  thing because you don’t have to think about that aspect with that young guy.
  “I don’t need to tell Ben, ‘Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure,
  you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be
  ready, every game is like do or die’. With that guy, I don’t have that
  concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit. I really like that [he asks
  questions], especially when it is smart questions so he’s listened and he
  wants to perform so that is very good.” Sunderland: Speaking of Sunderland,
  Regis Le Bris is out to prove any doubters, if not Opta’s agenda-driven
  Commodore 64 wrong by ensuring his side hoover up as many points as possible
  as early as possible, starting tomorrow against West Ham at the Stadium of
  Light. “It’s always a new story and you can’t be just limited with previous
  experiences, so it’s a new experience and we believe we can hunt every single
  point and we’ll do our best for that,” said the French coach, who took his
  side up through the playoffs. “It’s still tough to assess the level of the
  league after one, two or three games, especially at the beginning of the
  league. After three, four or five weeks I think we’ll have a better
  understanding of the level, but the team will evolve as well. It’s a new team,
  we’ll learn. We’ll struggle, for sure, because the league is very tough. It’s
  the best in the world but let’s fight and we’ll see.” OK computer? Everyone
  loves a “super-computer”, except fans of Sunderland, who it has been revealed
  were the only team in the Premier League that didn’t win it at least once in
  10,000 simulations of next season run by the Opta version. Some
  correspondence: Julian Borrill has got in touch to add his two cents to the
  discussion about the Arsenal manager’s dodgy abacus that kicked off before I
  got here. “Regarding Mikel Arteta’s mistaken points claim, he can at least
  clutch at the straw that Arsenal are the only team to have recorded more than
  73 points in each of the last three seasons,” he says. Nottingham Forest:
  While it would be over-egging the pudding to suggest that Nuno Espirito Santo
  is having a full-blown existential crisis ahead of the new season, he really
  seems to have cut loose in the press conference we alluded to earlier, ahead
  of his side’s match against Brentford at the City Ground on Sunday. “Dealing
  with doubts is the worst thing you can have in football,” he told reporters.
  “We have doubts, who is going to be [here], when are they going to come? All
  these things create doubts. Not only me but in the club. What we want is
  game-by-game to have as many options as possible. Europe will come after, and
  for sure it will be better, but for now, until that happens, it is a major
  concern. “The owner is aware, the club is aware, everyone is aware. Everybody
  knows the reality. This is a lost chance that we had as a group to do it. So
  far this summer, Forest have sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle, managed to hold
  on to Morgan Gibbs-White in the face of interest from Tottenham and brought in
  Igor Jesus, Jair Cunha, Dan Ndoye and goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Nuno is believed
  to be hankering after several more recruits including a full-back, a winger
  and a striker. Everton: David Moyes’s side kick off their Premier League
  campaign with a Monday night trip to Elland Road and ahead of the game against
  Leeds, the Scot has been complaining about internal leaks at the club.
  Addressing rumours that Jarrad Brantwaithe would miss the game through injury,
  Moyes promised to track down the mole who had made the news public. “We’ve got
  to find out who is giving that news out,” he said. “I am unhappy with it and I
  think all managers don’t like it. It’s coming from inside the building and we
  will find out.” Moyes declared himself reasonably content with Everton’s
  business in the transfer window but said he needs to get additional bodies in
  before it shuts. “We are pleased with the players we have added, but I am not
  pleased because I think I still need more,” he said. “We want to continue to
  adding to what we have because we are short in certain areas.” Jack Grealish,
  Thierno Barry and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall are among Everton’s more high profile
  signings this summer, while the club are reported to be in dogged pursuit of
  Southampton’s teenage winger Tyler Dibling, who is back training with Will
  Still’s squad after being excluded for their first two games of the season
  because his manager said he “wasn’t in the right headspace” given the
  speculation surrounding his future. Brighton: I have a feeling Brighton could
  flirt with a top four finish this season, if they improve their results
  against sides in the bottom half of the table and avoid 7-0 tonkings at the
  hands of Nottingham Forest. Fabian Hurzeler’s side failed to beat any of the
  three relegated sides at home last season but were only five points below
  fifth place and eight points below fourth at the end of the season. With a
  season’s worth of English top flight managerial experience, I’m expecting more
  from the young German coach this time around. “The main thing is self-belief,
  focusing on our ability and quality,” he said ahead of his side’s home game
  against Fulham tomorrow. “Most players are fit and if the transfer window
  [were to] close tomorrow, I would be happy.” No doubt, as it would mean Carlos
  Baleba, who is wanted by Manchester United, would still be in a squad from
  which Solly March and Adam Webster are the only absentees through injury.
  Despite losing Joao Pedro to Chelsea, Hurzeler is confident Brighton can make
  up any shortfall of goals their former striker might have taken to Stamford
  Bridge and with some justification – Brighton had no fewer than 16 different
  scorers in the Premier League last season, three of whom chipped in with 10 or
  more goals. “We need to be patient,” Hurzeler said of Brighton’s new
  18-year-old Greek striker Charalampos Kostoulas. “Just because we spent £30
  million doesn’t mean he’ll start immediately. “We can’t replace [Joao Pedro]
  one to one, but we can replace him as a group. We have many players who can
  score goals. We can’t challenge other teams with financial resources, but we
  can challenge them with togetherness, work ethic, playing intensely and being
  fearless.” Grrrr! More from Regis: The Sunderland head coach admitted that
  avoiding relegation will be challenging but went on to say he is pleased with
  the work that has been done on and off the training pitch this summer. “We
  have to accept that we will suffer because the league is the best in the
  world, but let’s fight and we’ll see,” he said. On the club’s busy off-season,
  he had this to say: “Busy. Interesting. The workflow was really positive. You
  can feel it in the building. Lots of work to do as it is a massive change. We
  reinforce everything in the club to be competitive at that level, so challenge
  is there but it’s very positive the way we solve different problems and it has
  been a very positive experience.” Sunderland: Back in the Premier League after
  eight seasons in the EFL wilderness, Sunderland have already signed 11 new
  players, one of whom, Granit Xhaka has been given the role of club captain. He
  takes the armband from Dan Neil, who is still a member of head coach Regis Le
  Bris’s squad. “It’s really natural because of Granit’s level and his
  experience, leadership and understanding of the game,” said Le Bris ahead of
  Sunderland’s match against West Ham at the Stadium of Light tomorrow. “It’s
  really easy after 10 minutes on the pitch to know that he will be our captain.
  For Dan it’s an opportunity to grow. He’s young, still only 23 and he has the
  potential to become a Premier League player. For us as a club, a squad, as a
  coach and as a manager, it’s a chance with this new experience to grow and
  that is the same for Dan.” Nottingham Forest: Nuno Espirito Santo’s side host
  Brentford at the City Ground on Sunday and it would be fair to say the
  Portuguese coach cut a forlorn figure at his pre-match press conference. as he
  outlined some serious concerns about the lack of depth in his squad ahead of a
  new season in which they will also be competing in Europe for the first time
  in 30 years. “One thing I always like and prioritise as a coach is getting the
  squad ready as soon as possible,” he said. “This way, we have the chance to
  create bonds and complexities that we can try over and over again. We haven’t
  had the chance to do that. We are fortunate enough that the supporters
  nowadays know a lot about what’s going on. They only have to look at the squad
  and in their minds they are thinking: ‘we might need other options.’ The fans
  know, but I ask for their unconditional support. I know they are going to be
  noisy, they will help us and I promise we will fight.” With Edu five weeks
  into his role as Forest’s new global sporting director, the club have been
  strongly linked with moves for James McAtee (Manchester City), Omari
  Hutchinson (Ipswich Town), Arnaud Kalimuendo (Rennes) and Douglas Luiz
  (Juventus). And with that, it’s over to Barry Glendenning for the big buildup
  to the actual football. Louise Taylor attended Eddie Howe’s morning press
  call, and runs the rule over the Newcastle s situation, Alexander Isak and
  beyond. It would be inconceivable to think a manager as emotionally tuned-in
  as Howe would not have second-guessed his leading scorer’s disillusion. In
  perhaps the most revealing moment of Friday’s press conference he was asked
  whether, when Newcastle sealed Champions League qualification in May, he was
  confident of Isak fulfilling the three remaining years on his contract. This
  season’s crisis club? Who had Aston Villa? Might these words from Unai Emery
  set some fans on edge? “We are starting more or less like when I arrived here.
  We are not a contender to be in the top seven for this reason. Of course we
  have the capacity to build a strong team, but not with the same budget [as the
  big clubs]. We have to be competitive with our players and keep working hard
  as well as staying motivated. We are going to start tomorrow and there 38
  matches in the Premier League but we are not contenders to be in the top
  seven.” PSR concerns have cut into spending plans. There was a report on
  Thursday that the Jacob Ramsey cash may not be able to be reinvested. More on
  Arsenal. This week, in a stage appearance in Ireland for Newtalk’s Off The
  Ball, Tony Adams, the greatest of all modern Gunners captains, wondered why
  Martin Odegaard is the current club captain. In response, Arteta had this to
  say: Well, my opinion is clear and it’s not just my opinion, it’s all the
  staff and especially the players. I asked them to vote the captain and I got
  the result yesterday and by a mile away, by a big, big 100 miles, everybody
  choosing the same person, which is Martin Odegaard. Which is the most clear
  sign that you can have. It’s how they feel about who has to be their captain
  to defend, improve and win the matches that we want to win. So I think there’s
  no question about that. More on Mikel’s dodgy calculator from Bernhard Schulz:
  “I calculated the same. And if if you add yet another season it comes to
  Liverpool 325, Ars 316, City 344 points total.” Liverpool 84/82/67 = 233
  Arsenal. 74/89/84 = 247 Man City. 71/91/98 = 251 Pep on City’s
  possible/probable outgoing transfer business: James McAtee, set for Nottingham
  Forest: “I would love to have Macca with me but we have too many players and
  he wanted more minutes. I understand completely. I would love to take a lot of
  academy players, be patient and give them more time. Like Phil [Foden]. He had
  the potential to be with us but when he wants more minutes and we don’t give
  them then I understand completely.” Savinho and Ederson, neither of whom will
  face Wolves: “If they want to leave then they will come to me. I’m working
  with them because I’m here. If they want to leave then they will knock on my
  door. All the players that are here are our players and I will work with them.
  Nobody knows what is going to happen over the next two weeks.” Pep Guardiola
  on Jack Grealish’s loan: “The same as the other players. I wish him all the
  best at the traditional club that is Everton. Hopefully he can play, play and
  play. This is the reason that we decided it was the best for him. He needs to
  play, play and play.” Dean Haigh has this to say on Mikel Arteta: “[He] might
  need to check a (second..?) calculator, or to stop digging and/or clutching at
  straws. For the last three seasons Arsenal HAVEN’T won more points combined
  than anybody else in the league. Predictably, they’re in second...” Steven
  Pye, a regular contributor, has shared this piece on Manchester 4-1 Arsenal in
  1989, a scoreline I only learned about in a Normandy hypermarché on the
  following Monday. How exciting. I was delighted. Over to Steven: “I wondered
  if you might be interested in a blog I’ve just written about Neil Webb and his
  dream debut for Manchester United in August 1989: ”Michael Knighton was not
  the only man to score a memorable goal at the Stretford End that day, as
  United hammered reigning champions Arsenal 4-1. As an Arsenal fan, it ruined
  my 14th birthday...” Read that here. David Moyes on Everton’s new signing,
  Jack Grealish: “He looks the same - big calves! I think Jack can play in
  several positions, as a midfielder [as well as a winger]. My aim is to get
  Jack in a creative postion where he can score and assist goals. “It is a big
  challenge for Jack and I am looking forward to seeing how he responds to it.
  The best one I can think of is when I brought Jesse Lingard to West Ham. He
  was probably not expected to be too successful, and maybe a little bit worn
  down, but I think he scored something around 10 goals in 12 games and got
  himself back in the England team. “If Jack can do a bit of the Jesse Lingard,
  it will be a great story. It is a World Cup year and he is in good enough
  shape. I just need to get him enough time.” Ruben Amorim on new signing
  Benjamin Sesko: “I think he has great potential in everything he does. He can
  play different types of football, he is going to feel that Premier League is
  really aggressive. He is going to learn but he has a great potential and I can
  see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. “That’s why
  we paid so much money to have a striker that will have his history in our
  club.” First of all, physically, he’s ready. That is a big component in our
  league. Then, he’s really smart. Every detail that he asks, he’s a guy that is
  always thinking. He spends all afternoon here working on his fitness, so he’s
  ready to play. We will see if he’s going to start.” “He’s one guy who stays
  here, has lunch, and goes to the medical department, does the stretching. He
  is always thinking about football. He’s really obsessed about that and that is
  a good thing because you don’t have to think about that aspect with that young
  guy. “I don’t need to tell Ben, ‘Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of
  pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we
  need to be ready, every game is like do or die’. With that guy, I don’t have
  that concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit. I really like that (he
  asks questions), especially when it is smart questions so he’s listened and he
  wants to perform so that is very good.” Big day for people called Ben: Sesko,
  Doak, Chilwell, Fisher. Krishna gets in touch: “How long will Amorim survive
  as a manager if he loses matchday two also? I can’t see United beating Arsenal
  this weekend. Has there been any other team that has unraveled so
  spectacularly and never recovered a decade down the line from the loss of
  their charismatic manager like Man Utd.” Well, there’s, er Manchester United
  1969 to 1990, there’s Liverpool’s long 1990s. Arsenal’s 1960s didn’t come to
  much. Leeds lost Revie in 1974 and it wasn’t until 1988 that Sgt Wilko came
  in. And you might want to look up Huddersfield Town after Herbert Chapman. A
  reminder: Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are still Chelsea players. Not
  inconsequentially, they are among the club’s best-paid employees. Where will
  they wash up? Sterling is 30, Chilwell is 28. Mikel Arteta has got his
  calculator out again. Ahead of Sunday’s game with Manchester United, he had
  this to say: “If you keep digging, digging and digging, then one day the gold
  is going to be there. All the time, it is what I have been taught my whole
  life. For the last three seasons we have more points [combined] than anybody
  else in the league and that says a lot about our consistency. Now we just have
  to do it in a season.” More Farke on Calvert-Lewin: “We are all pretty happy
  and delighted that he will wear a Leeds shirt from now on. He is obviously a
  proven player at Premier League level. As a newly-promoted side, we want to
  sign players that have already delivered at the top level but are still at a
  good age and on the way up in their career. These boxes are all ticked by
  him.” Shaun gets in touch: “When I first saw the reference to the game I
  shuddered because I remembered how horrifically one-sided it was. Gera scored
  a fantastic goal for them (I was right behind the goal) and we had someone
  (Skrtel maybe?) sent off very early in the second half. It really could’ve
  been 5 or 6-0 (pretty sure they missed a penalty too). “But anyway, I have to
  say, what a glorious away fan experience West Brom provided back then. They
  opened all the back doors to the stand and had an enclosed hospitality area
  outside - beers, coffees, burgers etc, so you could quickly grab a pint and
  have a cigarette at half-time. “Been away to a few grounds and the experience
  there was probably the best. (Despite the horrible result). I wonder if others
  have others ?” Yes, big fan of the Hawthorns. Proper. That game was when
  Brendan Rodgers gave this pre-season talk. Thanks, Dave. My David “Kid Jenson
  anecdote is that I once saw him in the late, lamented Cobham Tandoori. He was
  in the company of Mick Brown, of Capital Radio and Pat and Mick fame. If you
  can beat that level of celeb spot, I’d be very surprised. That’s me done
  again. I shall return you to John Brewin for more build-up, news and transfer
  rumours. Leeds have bolstered their forward line by signing former Everton
  striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin on a free transfer. The 28-year-old was a free
  agent after leaving the Toffees earlier this summer. Leeds boss Daniel Farke
  confirmed Calvert-Lewin’s arrival in a press conference: “He will be a member
  of our squad from this afternoon on. Dominic has a really good age and proven
  in PL level. Scored nearly 60 goals at this level. He has all the skills you
  would like your striker to have. “Last few seasons interrupted by injuries but
  he played 26 games last season. He can reach former heights. We will build his
  fitness step by step and build his confidence.” If Calvert-Lewin gets the nod
  for Leeds’ opener on Monday night, his opponents will be Everton! A couple of
  emails. One about Ben Doak, the other more Ben Jonson. Morgan Blake: “I
  suppose Ben Doak leaving Liverpool is the pragmatic thing for everyone
  involved, I just find it a little bit depressing that another young player
  hasn’t made it. I hope there’s a buyback clause!” krishnamoorthy v: “Will
  Liverpool walk alone this season or will someone be Gunning for them? Is a
  United City threat on the cards? Is there someone from a Forest wearing Spurs
  throwing in their gauntlet? Or will someone cause them the Blues?” Liverpool’s
  official website is showing Arne Slot’s column notes from tonight’s matchday
  programme. Tributes will be paid to Diogo Jota and Andre Silva before the 8pm
  BST kick-off against Bournemouth, following the brothers’ tragic passing in a
  road traffic accident in July. Slot writes: “We know that this will be a very
  emotional occasion, given it is the first league game we have played since we
  lost Diogo and Andre. As I have said previously, the tributes that have been
  paid throughout the football world, and especially within the LFC community,
  have been truly special, and I know that tonight we will come together to
  honour them once more. “I believe that Diogo’s wife, his children and his
  family will be in attendance and it is important that, as a club, we show that
  they will always have our love and support as they deal with this most tragic
  of situations. We are there for them always. “In a football sense, we are, of
  course, glad to be back here for a competitive game. It has been a while, of
  course, but there is nothing like Anfield under the lights and we are all
  looking forward to getting our campaign under way this evening. We know that
  this will be a tough beginning for us, and if we needed any reminder of that,
  then the FA Community Shield last weekend provided it. “Crystal Palace,
  remember, were the team that finished 12th in the Premier League last season,
  and you saw at Wembley the quality that they have in their team. I expect
  similar from Bournemouth, who finished ninth in the table last year and who
  have a lot of very good players and, in Andoni Iraola, a very good manager
  too. We welcome them to our home, of course. “From our perspective, there have
  been a lot of positives from our pre-season, as well as a few areas we clearly
  need to improve in. I think you saw during our tour of Asia, against Athletic
  Club and against Palace, that we are able to create more chances, that we are
  more comfortable in possession and more dominant with the ball. “Last season
  we had a lot of ball possession but that didn’t always lead to promising
  situations. Now, we are better in creating and getting promising situations
  than we were, in my opinion, throughout the whole of last season. “Hopefully
  you have seen already what some of our new signings can bring. It was good to
  see both Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong on the scoresheet at Wembley, and
  there were good contributions too from Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez, who
  plays against his former club this evening of course. “In terms of the
  improvement we will be looking for from the team, I think it is clear that in
  a defensive sense we can get better. I said after the game on Sunday that
  while we have not been conceding a lot of chances throughout pre-season, the
  chances we are conceding have tended to lead to goals. That was the case
  against Palace, and before that against Athletic Club, AC Milan and Yokohama
  F. Marinos. “What made us really strong last season was we won often by a
  margin of one goal, and that had mostly to do with us keeping a clean sheet or
  as a maximum conceding one goal. That is something we would like to continue
  this season. “Generally, though, we are in a good place heading into the new
  campaign. It is true that there have been a few changes to our squad, with new
  players coming into the club and others moving on. Naturally, that means there
  will be a period of adaptation, but I am confident in the squad we have and
  that it will be ready for the challenges ahead. “Those challenges start
  tonight, and I am looking forward to seeing and hearing you all in full voice
  again. Your support is never taken for granted, and it will be crucial for us
  once more as we look to defend our Premier League title.” West Ham boss Graham
  Potter is confident the club’s summer signings can help bring a new energy to
  the team this season. Potter is looking to reshape the squad after winger
  Mohammed Kudus was sold to Tottenham in a £50million deal, while Aaron
  Cresswell, goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, Vladimir Coufal and Michail Antonio
  were all released. Danish goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, El Hadji Malick Diouf,
  Kyle Walker-Peters and forward Callum Wilson could all make their debut in the
  Premier League opener at newly-promoted Sunderland on Saturday. Potter told a
  press conference. “The club has to move on, that is part of life and
  professional sport. We have to bring new energy into the team, which I think
  we have done. I am really happy with pre-season, how the group has been
  connected and how the environment we have tried to create has been really
  positive, so it gives us a foundation.” Potter is expecting to face a
  Sunderland side determined to make a mark on their long-awaited return to the
  top flight, having won the Sky Bet Championship final at Wembley. “They are
  back in the Premier League now and I am sure they will be really excited and
  focused,” said Potter, whose team finished 14th last season. For us, it is
  about what we can do and trying to match the positivity of the environment.”
  (PA Media) Some Bournemouth team news ahead of tonight’s opener at Anfield.
  The Cherries will be without Justin Kluivert, Ryan Christie and Lewis Cook.
  Dutch forward Kluivert has been unable to train due to an issue which has
  taken longer than expected to heal, Scottish midfielder Christie has only
  recently returned to full training and the suspended Cook is also recovering
  from injury. Winger Luis Sinisterra is another player not expected to make the
  trip to Anfield as he nears full fitness following long-term injury.
  Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola told a press conference: “Justin hasn’t been
  training with us and won’t play. Ryan has been training this week with us,
  which is positive. It’s too early for him to play as he hasn’t done any
  pre-season. He hasn’t done a lot of things for a lot of weeks, so it’s too
  early – but it’s good to have him back on the pitch with the group.” Iraola is
  also expected to be without Dango Ouattara after it was reported Brentford
  have agreed a deal worth up to £42.5million for the forward and he was
  scheduled for a medical at the Gtech Community Stadium. (PA Media) Apparently,
  The Opta Supercomputer makes Liverpool 69.4% favourites to beat Bournemouth
  tonight. A few more fun facts here... The Reds have won their last six home
  league games against Bournemouth by an aggregate scoreline of 23-2. Liverpool
  haven’t lost their opening league game in any of the last 12 seasons, winning
  nine of them. Their last campaign to start with a loss was 2012-13, Brendan
  Rodgers’ first season in charge, when they lost 3-0 at West Bromwich Albion.
  The Reds’ unbeaten stretch is the longest current run without defeat on MD1 of
  any Premier League side. Mo Salah has scored more goals (9) and registered
  more goal involvements (14) on first matchdays of Premier League campaigns
  than any other player. Great news for completists: our 20th and final Premier
  League team preview has dropped. We close with Ben Fisher’s analysis of
  Wolves. Thanks John. Yes, I was spinning a few discs in a Bradford watering
  hole last night actually. Sham 69, Buzzcocks and Jilted John on the playlist
  for those interested. Most in the pub weren’t. As for “Kid” Jensen. “In his
  personal life, David is married to Iceland-born Guðrún. He loves his football
  and supports Crystal Palace FC, where he is Chairman of Crystal Palace F.C.
  Vice-President’s Club.” Your lunchtime companion will be West Yorkshire’s
  answer to David “Kid” Jensen, David Tindall. Ian Copesake gets in touch:
  “Hürzeler’s comment on Baleba’s new trim is very revealing as the old hippy
  adage was recently proven by Darwin Núñez: change your hair, change your
  club.“ Almost…cut my hair… Graeme Neill gets in touch and has this to say: “As
  great as it is to book a £24m(!) profit on Ben Doak, it is always a shame when
  a young player doesn’t quite follow through on the potential they once showed.
  I know not everyone can be a Trent but for every one of him, there are
  countless Rhian Brewsters, Sheyi Ojos, Ben Woodburns and so on.” Here’s our
  story on the Doak coming in. Some further transfer news below: Bayern Munich
  have opened talks with Chelsea over a deal for Christopher Nkunku. The France
  forward has fallen out of favour and is one of several attackers expected to
  leave Stamford Bridge before the transfer window shuts. Nkunku never really
  got a run at Chelsea. There’s a player there. Perhaps. Bournemouth are closing
  in on a deal to sign the Liverpool forward Ben Doak for £25m. The 19-year-old
  will move on for a huge profit on the £600,000 Liverpool paid Celtic in
  training compensation in 2022. The Scotland international has been linked with
  umpteen Premier League clubs and Porto but is expected to remain in England.
  Doak’s upcoming switch to the south coast comes as Bournemouth’s Dango
  Ouattara is poised to join Brentford for up to £42.5m. Chelsea need a defender
  after Levil Colwill’s ACL injury. Will they buy one? It’s possible, according
  to manager Enzo Maresca. It’s always possible with Chelsea. “We are trying to
  find a solution internally, but the club know exactly what I think - we need a
  central defender - but we are looking internally.” An addendum to Howe’s
  stance on Isak. Asked whether the striker could ever play again for Newcastle,
  Howe said this: ““Yes, I believe there is, but of course discussions and talks
  would have to take place in order for that to happen.” Ben Fisher speaks to
  Aston Villa’s playmaker, Youri Tielemans. “I always feel like once I’m in that
  rhythm, I feel the best I can be, really. When I’m in that rhythm, you just
  play, recover, play, recover, and you just get used to it and hopefully, I can
  do that again. We’re obviously well tracked by medical and technical staff –
  there are a lot of things going on backstage, I would say, where you have to
  just give your body the best chance possible to perform.” Noel Patrick has a
  suggestion: “You really should have a feature on Mondays to evaluate how the
  previous weekend’s “10 things to look out for...” went.” I’ll put it to the
  editorial board. Eddie Howe – and his nephew – have had quite the summer in
  the recruitment game. Of Alexander Isak, Howe would not say whether he will
  play against Aston Villa. Vibes: doubtful. Instead, the signing of Aston
  Villa’s Jacob Ramsey is a useful addition. I am really pleased, it has been a
  slow burner this summer. We tried to be active early, that didn’t happen. Then
  you’re trying to turn things in a positive way. Gradually piece by piece we
  have been becoming stronger. We have quality players coming in. The top end of
  the pitch is not ideal, but we have time. “In early pre-season, I have not
  shied away from it being a difficult time. You could see that in our
  performances. But the players are strong mentally, the mood has been good,
  performances recently have been better. The group has reacted well. Sometimes
  these things can have a good effect, and we were close anyway. These things
  can unify you in a way you didn’t know possible.” On Isak: “There has been no
  change. All my focus is on Aston Villa tomorrow. Isak’s situation has been
  clear for a while and that will continue to be the case. I’ve had a great
  relationship with him, you need that partnership with every player. I have to
  work really closely with the player for his benefit, to try and improve them.
  I always want to be there for him. “I don’t think Isak would have done as well
  without that, his team mates, the supporters - he recognises that, he’s an
  intelligent person.” Fabian Hurzeler has had brief words to say on Manchester
  United’s pursuit of Carlos Baleba: “Very very very confident, that’s just my
  belief.” Brighton welcome Fulham tomorrow. Now, will Baleba play? Or be pulled
  out as Wissa has been by Brentford. “I didn’t see any change, he’s only
  changed his hair. I think that’s the change he’s made in the last two weeks.
  But overall he seems to be in a really good place, he’s enjoying it with his
  team-mates, he’s enjoying being a Brighton player. “I didn’t see any big
  changes and he’s an option to start tomorrow”. And on that bombshell, I’ll
  hand you over to John Brewin for more hot build-up. Enjoy. There’s a fair bit
  of talk ahead of the big Premier League kick-off that we could witness a
  four-team title race this season. This is how the bookies see it. The
  Manchester United price isn’t a misprint. 7/4 Liverpool 5/2 Arsenal 7/2
  Manchester City 8/1 Chelsea 25/1 Man Utd 50/1 Tottenham, Newcastle 80/1 Aston
  Villa Howard Webb admits there is no way back to refereeing for scandal-hit
  official David Coote. We all love a bargain. Although, in Premier League terms
  these days, a £30m transfer constitutes a bargain. You get the point though
  and here Harry Paterson lists several players who could end up looking real
  value for money. Fancy some in-depth team-by-team Premier League previews?
  Here’s West Ham, the 19th of 20, and we’ll complete the set with Wolves later
  today. Click away and you’ll find links to all the others. If Europe’s elite
  could not contain Paris Saint-Germain last season, what chance is there for
  Ligue 1’s impoverished chasing pack? That’s the question asked by Luke
  Entwhistle in his latest column via Get French Football News. Today’s Rumour
  Mill has dropped. John Brewin takes you through the latest gossip which
  features Manchester United, Brighton, Fulham and Spurs among others. The
  Football Weekly pod squad have given their own musings on the new Premier
  League season. If you’re driving to a place an hour away today, you have one
  for the way out and for of the journey back. Or just sit in the sunshine
  somewhere and nod off halfway through the first one, perhaps waking after a
  fever dream involving Declan Rice throwing fruit at a dinosaur ridden by
  Howard Webb. Andy Hunter and Louise Taylor assess the chances of the Premier
  League’s three promoted teams and whether they can avoid the same fate
  suffered by recent predecessors. Will the song play out again? Florian Wirtz
  makes his Premier League debut tonight. With his control, vision, movement and
  weight of pass, he’s a delightful footballer and it’s easy to see why
  Liverpool paid the big bucks. Arne Slot is thrilled to have the German on
  board but offered a tinge of realism in his press conference. Here’s Barney
  Ronay as the starting gun prepares to fire on the new Premier League season.
  There are very good reasons why this thing has become the world’s dominant pop
  cultural stage. It works. No matter how sated you might have become by the end
  of the last one, there is always renewal and fresh hunger. Albeit with an even
  stronger sense this time of shifting planes, hard lines dissolving, a Premier
  League that is, for the first time in some time, a little menaced by omens,
  portents and notes of horn-parping rapture. Let’s get straight into it by
  welcoming back an old favourite. Ladies and Gentleman, I give you 10 things…
  It’s back! The Premier League is back! A whopping 83 days since the 2024/25
  season came to an end, champions Liverpool get the new 2025/26 campaign
  underway with a home game against Bournemouth tonight. Of course, we’ve hardly
  seen a ball kicked inbetween bar a dramatic Women’s Euros, a bonkers one-sided
  Champions League final, a turgid Europa League final, entertaining renewals of
  the Community Shield and Super Cup, rough-and-tumble action in the
  Championship, League One and League Two, key Champions League qualifiers,
  clue-gathering pre-season friendlies… you get the idea. But let’s not spoil
  the ‘it’s back’ narrative because now are empty lives are about to be filled
  again. We’ll have an absolute raft of scene setters for the big kick-off which
  starts at Anfield tonight and concludes at Elland Road on Monday via a
  Matchweek 1 which also features five games on Saturday (just three at 3pm) and
  three on Sunday. Will we have a four-way title race? Will the three promoted
  sides go straight back down? How much improvement do Manchester United and
  Spurs have in them after hideous finishes last time? Will Alexander Isak move
  from Tyneside to Merseyside? Buckle up, it’s time to find out!

Today’s news in brief … The new Premier League season kicks off tonight with the reigning champions Liverpool hosting Bournemouth at Anfield under the Friday night lights. Rute Cardoso, the wife of Diogo Jota, and the couple’s three children are expected to attend Liverpool’s first competitive game since the tragic summer passing of Jota and his brother, Andre Silva. Tributes to both men will be paid before the game. Howard Webb, the head of the PGMOL, has said that he sees no way back to refereeing for scandal-hit official David Coote, who was sacked last year. Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has said it is his belief the club can hold on to midfielder Carlos Baleba for another season despite strong interest from Manchester United. There has been “no change” to the stand-off involving Newcastle United and Alexander Isak, according the club’s head coach, Eddie Howe, who told reporters whatever happens next is out of his control but he can envisage a scenario where the on-strike striker plays for the club again. Bournemouth are closing in on a deal to sign the Liverpool forward Ben Doak for £25m and could even spirit the 19-year-old Scot away from Anfield on their team coach after tonight’s match. Liverpool have just announced the signing of the 18-year-old centre-back Giovanni Leoni from Parma for an initial fee of £26m. Bayern Munich have opened talks with Chelsea over a deal for their out-of-favour forward Christopher Nkunku, who never really impressed during the limited opportunities afforded to him at Stamford Bridge in the past two years. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has become the latest target man to be plucked from the revolving carousel of No9s. The former Everton striker has joined Leeds on a free transfer in what could be a canny bit of business if the 28-year-old’s new employers can keep him out of the treatment room. Unai Emery reckons his Aston Villa team are “not a contender to be in the top seven” this season as their efforts at summer squad-maintenance and rebuilding are being hamstrung by profit and sustainability rules. And Nuno Espirito Santo’s first press conference of the season was a similar study in existential angst as the Nottingham Forest manager bemoaned the lack of sufficient additions to his squad ahead of a season in which the club will be competing in Europe for the first time in 30 years. Liverpool: While the Premier League champions look very well equipped for the season ahead, there are concerns about their lack of cover at centre-back should any misfortune on the injury front befall Virgil van Dijk or Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez is a fairly reliable option and in pre-season, both Andy Robertson and Ryan Gravenberch were called upon to put in shifts in the heart of Liverpool’s defence during friendlies. The good news for Liverpool fans is that Arne Slot has moved to allay any fears by signing the 18-year-old centre-back Giovanni Leoni from Parma for an initial £26m. He has signed a six-year contract and is regarded by the club as a potential long-term successor to Big Virgil. Leoni was the subject of interest from several clubs including Newcastle but will be at Anfield tonight to watch his new teammates kick off their Premier League campaign against Bournemouth. Read on … Manchester United: Ruben Amorim has been singing the praises of the club’s new striker Benjamin Sesko, who it seems has been making a good impression around the club’s new and improved Carrington training complex since his arrival from RB Leipzig. “He’s one guy who stays here, has lunch and goes to the medical department, does the stretching,” he said. “He is always thinking about football. He’s really obsessed about that and that is a good thing because you don’t have to think about that aspect with that young guy. “I don’t need to tell Ben, ‘Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready, every game is like do or die’. With that guy, I don’t have that concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit. I really like that [he asks questions], especially when it is smart questions so he’s listened and he wants to perform so that is very good.” Sunderland: Speaking of Sunderland, Regis Le Bris is out to prove any doubters, if not Opta’s agenda-driven Commodore 64 wrong by ensuring his side hoover up as many points as possible as early as possible, starting tomorrow against West Ham at the Stadium of Light. “It’s always a new story and you can’t be just limited with previous experiences, so it’s a new experience and we believe we can hunt every single point and we’ll do our best for that,” said the French coach, who took his side up through the playoffs. “It’s still tough to assess the level of the league after one, two or three games, especially at the beginning of the league. After three, four or five weeks I think we’ll have a better understanding of the level, but the team will evolve as well. It’s a new team, we’ll learn. We’ll struggle, for sure, because the league is very tough. It’s the best in the world but let’s fight and we’ll see.” OK computer? Everyone loves a “super-computer”, except fans of Sunderland, who it has been revealed were the only team in the Premier League that didn’t win it at least once in 10,000 simulations of next season run by the Opta version. Some correspondence: Julian Borrill has got in touch to add his two cents to the discussion about the Arsenal manager’s dodgy abacus that kicked off before I got here. “Regarding Mikel Arteta’s mistaken points claim, he can at least clutch at the straw that Arsenal are the only team to have recorded more than 73 points in each of the last three seasons,” he says. Nottingham Forest: While it would be over-egging the pudding to suggest that Nuno Espirito Santo is having a full-blown existential crisis ahead of the new season, he really seems to have cut loose in the press conference we alluded to earlier, ahead of his side’s match against Brentford at the City Ground on Sunday. “Dealing with doubts is the worst thing you can have in football,” he told reporters. “We have doubts, who is going to be [here], when are they going to come? All these things create doubts. Not only me but in the club. What we want is game-by-game to have as many options as possible. Europe will come after, and for sure it will be better, but for now, until that happens, it is a major concern. “The owner is aware, the club is aware, everyone is aware. Everybody knows the reality. This is a lost chance that we had as a group to do it. So far this summer, Forest have sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle, managed to hold on to Morgan Gibbs-White in the face of interest from Tottenham and brought in Igor Jesus, Jair Cunha, Dan Ndoye and goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Nuno is believed to be hankering after several more recruits including a full-back, a winger and a striker. Everton: David Moyes’s side kick off their Premier League campaign with a Monday night trip to Elland Road and ahead of the game against Leeds, the Scot has been complaining about internal leaks at the club. Addressing rumours that Jarrad Brantwaithe would miss the game through injury, Moyes promised to track down the mole who had made the news public. “We’ve got to find out who is giving that news out,” he said. “I am unhappy with it and I think all managers don’t like it. It’s coming from inside the building and we will find out.” Moyes declared himself reasonably content with Everton’s business in the transfer window but said he needs to get additional bodies in before it shuts. “We are pleased with the players we have added, but I am not pleased because I think I still need more,” he said. “We want to continue to adding to what we have because we are short in certain areas.” Jack Grealish, Thierno Barry and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall are among Everton’s more high profile signings this summer, while the club are reported to be in dogged pursuit of Southampton’s teenage winger Tyler Dibling, who is back training with Will Still’s squad after being excluded for their first two games of the season because his manager said he “wasn’t in the right headspace” given the speculation surrounding his future. Brighton: I have a feeling Brighton could flirt with a top four finish this season, if they improve their results against sides in the bottom half of the table and avoid 7-0 tonkings at the hands of Nottingham Forest. Fabian Hurzeler’s side failed to beat any of the three relegated sides at home last season but were only five points below fifth place and eight points below fourth at the end of the season. With a season’s worth of English top flight managerial experience, I’m expecting more from the young German coach this time around. “The main thing is self-belief, focusing on our ability and quality,” he said ahead of his side’s home game against Fulham tomorrow. “Most players are fit and if the transfer window [were to] close tomorrow, I would be happy.” No doubt, as it would mean Carlos Baleba, who is wanted by Manchester United, would still be in a squad from which Solly March and Adam Webster are the only absentees through injury. Despite losing Joao Pedro to Chelsea, Hurzeler is confident Brighton can make up any shortfall of goals their former striker might have taken to Stamford Bridge and with some justification – Brighton had no fewer than 16 different scorers in the Premier League last season, three of whom chipped in with 10 or more goals. “We need to be patient,” Hurzeler said of Brighton’s new 18-year-old Greek striker Charalampos Kostoulas. “Just because we spent £30 million doesn’t mean he’ll start immediately. “We can’t replace [Joao Pedro] one to one, but we can replace him as a group. We have many players who can score goals. We can’t challenge other teams with financial resources, but we can challenge them with togetherness, work ethic, playing intensely and being fearless.” Grrrr! More from Regis: The Sunderland head coach admitted that avoiding relegation will be challenging but went on to say he is pleased with the work that has been done on and off the training pitch this summer. “We have to accept that we will suffer because the league is the best in the world, but let’s fight and we’ll see,” he said. On the club’s busy off-season, he had this to say: “Busy. Interesting. The workflow was really positive. You can feel it in the building. Lots of work to do as it is a massive change. We reinforce everything in the club to be competitive at that level, so challenge is there but it’s very positive the way we solve different problems and it has been a very positive experience.” Sunderland: Back in the Premier League after eight seasons in the EFL wilderness, Sunderland have already signed 11 new players, one of whom, Granit Xhaka has been given the role of club captain. He takes the armband from Dan Neil, who is still a member of head coach Regis Le Bris’s squad. “It’s really natural because of Granit’s level and his experience, leadership and understanding of the game,” said Le Bris ahead of Sunderland’s match against West Ham at the Stadium of Light tomorrow. “It’s really easy after 10 minutes on the pitch to know that he will be our captain. For Dan it’s an opportunity to grow. He’s young, still only 23 and he has the potential to become a Premier League player. For us as a club, a squad, as a coach and as a manager, it’s a chance with this new experience to grow and that is the same for Dan.” Nottingham Forest: Nuno Espirito Santo’s side host Brentford at the City Ground on Sunday and it would be fair to say the Portuguese coach cut a forlorn figure at his pre-match press conference. as he outlined some serious concerns about the lack of depth in his squad ahead of a new season in which they will also be competing in Europe for the first time in 30 years. “One thing I always like and prioritise as a coach is getting the squad ready as soon as possible,” he said. “This way, we have the chance to create bonds and complexities that we can try over and over again. We haven’t had the chance to do that. We are fortunate enough that the supporters nowadays know a lot about what’s going on. They only have to look at the squad and in their minds they are thinking: ‘we might need other options.’ The fans know, but I ask for their unconditional support. I know they are going to be noisy, they will help us and I promise we will fight.” With Edu five weeks into his role as Forest’s new global sporting director, the club have been strongly linked with moves for James McAtee (Manchester City), Omari Hutchinson (Ipswich Town), Arnaud Kalimuendo (Rennes) and Douglas Luiz (Juventus). And with that, it’s over to Barry Glendenning for the big buildup to the actual football. Louise Taylor attended Eddie Howe’s morning press call, and runs the rule over the Newcastle s situation, Alexander Isak and beyond. It would be inconceivable to think a manager as emotionally tuned-in as Howe would not have second-guessed his leading scorer’s disillusion. In perhaps the most revealing moment of Friday’s press conference he was asked whether, when Newcastle sealed Champions League qualification in May, he was confident of Isak fulfilling the three remaining years on his contract. This season’s crisis club? Who had Aston Villa? Might these words from Unai Emery set some fans on edge? “We are starting more or less like when I arrived here. We are not a contender to be in the top seven for this reason. Of course we have the capacity to build a strong team, but not with the same budget [as the big clubs]. We have to be competitive with our players and keep working hard as well as staying motivated. We are going to start tomorrow and there 38 matches in the Premier League but we are not contenders to be in the top seven.” PSR concerns have cut into spending plans. There was a report on Thursday that the Jacob Ramsey cash may not be able to be reinvested. More on Arsenal. This week, in a stage appearance in Ireland for Newtalk’s Off The Ball, Tony Adams, the greatest of all modern Gunners captains, wondered why Martin Odegaard is the current club captain. In response, Arteta had this to say: Well, my opinion is clear and it’s not just my opinion, it’s all the staff and especially the players. I asked them to vote the captain and I got the result yesterday and by a mile away, by a big, big 100 miles, everybody choosing the same person, which is Martin Odegaard. Which is the most clear sign that you can have. It’s how they feel about who has to be their captain to defend, improve and win the matches that we want to win. So I think there’s no question about that. More on Mikel’s dodgy calculator from Bernhard Schulz: “I calculated the same. And if if you add yet another season it comes to Liverpool 325, Ars 316, City 344 points total.” Liverpool 84/82/67 = 233 Arsenal. 74/89/84 = 247 Man City. 71/91/98 = 251 Pep on City’s possible/probable outgoing transfer business: James McAtee, set for Nottingham Forest: “I would love to have Macca with me but we have too many players and he wanted more minutes. I understand completely. I would love to take a lot of academy players, be patient and give them more time. Like Phil [Foden]. He had the potential to be with us but when he wants more minutes and we don’t give them then I understand completely.” Savinho and Ederson, neither of whom will face Wolves: “If they want to leave then they will come to me. I’m working with them because I’m here. If they want to leave then they will knock on my door. All the players that are here are our players and I will work with them. Nobody knows what is going to happen over the next two weeks.” Pep Guardiola on Jack Grealish’s loan: “The same as the other players. I wish him all the best at the traditional club that is Everton. Hopefully he can play, play and play. This is the reason that we decided it was the best for him. He needs to play, play and play.” Dean Haigh has this to say on Mikel Arteta: “[He] might need to check a (second..?) calculator, or to stop digging and/or clutching at straws. For the last three seasons Arsenal HAVEN’T won more points combined than anybody else in the league. Predictably, they’re in second...” Steven Pye, a regular contributor, has shared this piece on Manchester 4-1 Arsenal in 1989, a scoreline I only learned about in a Normandy hypermarché on the following Monday. How exciting. I was delighted. Over to Steven: “I wondered if you might be interested in a blog I’ve just written about Neil Webb and his dream debut for Manchester United in August 1989: ”Michael Knighton was not the only man to score a memorable goal at the Stretford End that day, as United hammered reigning champions Arsenal 4-1. As an Arsenal fan, it ruined my 14th birthday...” Read that here. David Moyes on Everton’s new signing, Jack Grealish: “He looks the same - big calves! I think Jack can play in several positions, as a midfielder [as well as a winger]. My aim is to get Jack in a creative postion where he can score and assist goals. “It is a big challenge for Jack and I am looking forward to seeing how he responds to it. The best one I can think of is when I brought Jesse Lingard to West Ham. He was probably not expected to be too successful, and maybe a little bit worn down, but I think he scored something around 10 goals in 12 games and got himself back in the England team. “If Jack can do a bit of the Jesse Lingard, it will be a great story. It is a World Cup year and he is in good enough shape. I just need to get him enough time.” Ruben Amorim on new signing Benjamin Sesko: “I think he has great potential in everything he does. He can play different types of football, he is going to feel that Premier League is really aggressive. He is going to learn but he has a great potential and I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. “That’s why we paid so much money to have a striker that will have his history in our club.” First of all, physically, he’s ready. That is a big component in our league. Then, he’s really smart. Every detail that he asks, he’s a guy that is always thinking. He spends all afternoon here working on his fitness, so he’s ready to play. We will see if he’s going to start.” “He’s one guy who stays here, has lunch, and goes to the medical department, does the stretching. He is always thinking about football. He’s really obsessed about that and that is a good thing because you don’t have to think about that aspect with that young guy. “I don’t need to tell Ben, ‘Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready, every game is like do or die’. With that guy, I don’t have that concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit. I really like that (he asks questions), especially when it is smart questions so he’s listened and he wants to perform so that is very good.” Big day for people called Ben: Sesko, Doak, Chilwell, Fisher. Krishna gets in touch: “How long will Amorim survive as a manager if he loses matchday two also? I can’t see United beating Arsenal this weekend. Has there been any other team that has unraveled so spectacularly and never recovered a decade down the line from the loss of their charismatic manager like Man Utd.” Well, there’s, er Manchester United 1969 to 1990, there’s Liverpool’s long 1990s. Arsenal’s 1960s didn’t come to much. Leeds lost Revie in 1974 and it wasn’t until 1988 that Sgt Wilko came in. And you might want to look up Huddersfield Town after Herbert Chapman. A reminder: Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are still Chelsea players. Not inconsequentially, they are among the club’s best-paid employees. Where will they wash up? Sterling is 30, Chilwell is 28. Mikel Arteta has got his calculator out again. Ahead of Sunday’s game with Manchester United, he had this to say: “If you keep digging, digging and digging, then one day the gold is going to be there. All the time, it is what I have been taught my whole life. For the last three seasons we have more points [combined] than anybody else in the league and that says a lot about our consistency. Now we just have to do it in a season.” More Farke on Calvert-Lewin: “We are all pretty happy and delighted that he will wear a Leeds shirt from now on. He is obviously a proven player at Premier League level. As a newly-promoted side, we want to sign players that have already delivered at the top level but are still at a good age and on the way up in their career. These boxes are all ticked by him.” Shaun gets in touch: “When I first saw the reference to the game I shuddered because I remembered how horrifically one-sided it was. Gera scored a fantastic goal for them (I was right behind the goal) and we had someone (Skrtel maybe?) sent off very early in the second half. It really could’ve been 5 or 6-0 (pretty sure they missed a penalty too). “But anyway, I have to say, what a glorious away fan experience West Brom provided back then. They opened all the back doors to the stand and had an enclosed hospitality area outside - beers, coffees, burgers etc, so you could quickly grab a pint and have a cigarette at half-time. “Been away to a few grounds and the experience there was probably the best. (Despite the horrible result). I wonder if others have others ?” Yes, big fan of the Hawthorns. Proper. That game was when Brendan Rodgers gave this pre-season talk. Thanks, Dave. My David “Kid Jenson anecdote is that I once saw him in the late, lamented Cobham Tandoori. He was in the company of Mick Brown, of Capital Radio and Pat and Mick fame. If you can beat that level of celeb spot, I’d be very surprised. That’s me done again. I shall return you to John Brewin for more build-up, news and transfer rumours. Leeds have bolstered their forward line by signing former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin on a free transfer. The 28-year-old was a free agent after leaving the Toffees earlier this summer. Leeds boss Daniel Farke confirmed Calvert-Lewin’s arrival in a press conference: “He will be a member of our squad from this afternoon on. Dominic has a really good age and proven in PL level. Scored nearly 60 goals at this level. He has all the skills you would like your striker to have. “Last few seasons interrupted by injuries but he played 26 games last season. He can reach former heights. We will build his fitness step by step and build his confidence.” If Calvert-Lewin gets the nod for Leeds’ opener on Monday night, his opponents will be Everton! A couple of emails. One about Ben Doak, the other more Ben Jonson. Morgan Blake: “I suppose Ben Doak leaving Liverpool is the pragmatic thing for everyone involved, I just find it a little bit depressing that another young player hasn’t made it. I hope there’s a buyback clause!” krishnamoorthy v: “Will Liverpool walk alone this season or will someone be Gunning for them? Is a United City threat on the cards? Is there someone from a Forest wearing Spurs throwing in their gauntlet? Or will someone cause them the Blues?” Liverpool’s official website is showing Arne Slot’s column notes from tonight’s matchday programme. Tributes will be paid to Diogo Jota and Andre Silva before the 8pm BST kick-off against Bournemouth, following the brothers’ tragic passing in a road traffic accident in July. Slot writes: “We know that this will be a very emotional occasion, given it is the first league game we have played since we lost Diogo and Andre. As I have said previously, the tributes that have been paid throughout the football world, and especially within the LFC community, have been truly special, and I know that tonight we will come together to honour them once more. “I believe that Diogo’s wife, his children and his family will be in attendance and it is important that, as a club, we show that they will always have our love and support as they deal with this most tragic of situations. We are there for them always. “In a football sense, we are, of course, glad to be back here for a competitive game. It has been a while, of course, but there is nothing like Anfield under the lights and we are all looking forward to getting our campaign under way this evening. We know that this will be a tough beginning for us, and if we needed any reminder of that, then the FA Community Shield last weekend provided it. “Crystal Palace, remember, were the team that finished 12th in the Premier League last season, and you saw at Wembley the quality that they have in their team. I expect similar from Bournemouth, who finished ninth in the table last year and who have a lot of very good players and, in Andoni Iraola, a very good manager too. We welcome them to our home, of course. “From our perspective, there have been a lot of positives from our pre-season, as well as a few areas we clearly need to improve in. I think you saw during our tour of Asia, against Athletic Club and against Palace, that we are able to create more chances, that we are more comfortable in possession and more dominant with the ball. “Last season we had a lot of ball possession but that didn’t always lead to promising situations. Now, we are better in creating and getting promising situations than we were, in my opinion, throughout the whole of last season. “Hopefully you have seen already what some of our new signings can bring. It was good to see both Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong on the scoresheet at Wembley, and there were good contributions too from Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez, who plays against his former club this evening of course. “In terms of the improvement we will be looking for from the team, I think it is clear that in a defensive sense we can get better. I said after the game on Sunday that while we have not been conceding a lot of chances throughout pre-season, the chances we are conceding have tended to lead to goals. That was the case against Palace, and before that against Athletic Club, AC Milan and Yokohama F. Marinos. “What made us really strong last season was we won often by a margin of one goal, and that had mostly to do with us keeping a clean sheet or as a maximum conceding one goal. That is something we would like to continue this season. “Generally, though, we are in a good place heading into the new campaign. It is true that there have been a few changes to our squad, with new players coming into the club and others moving on. Naturally, that means there will be a period of adaptation, but I am confident in the squad we have and that it will be ready for the challenges ahead. “Those challenges start tonight, and I am looking forward to seeing and hearing you all in full voice again. Your support is never taken for granted, and it will be crucial for us once more as we look to defend our Premier League title.” West Ham boss Graham Potter is confident the club’s summer signings can help bring a new energy to the team this season. Potter is looking to reshape the squad after winger Mohammed Kudus was sold to Tottenham in a £50million deal, while Aaron Cresswell, goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, Vladimir Coufal and Michail Antonio were all released. Danish goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, El Hadji Malick Diouf, Kyle Walker-Peters and forward Callum Wilson could all make their debut in the Premier League opener at newly-promoted Sunderland on Saturday. Potter told a press conference. “The club has to move on, that is part of life and professional sport. We have to bring new energy into the team, which I think we have done. I am really happy with pre-season, how the group has been connected and how the environment we have tried to create has been really positive, so it gives us a foundation.” Potter is expecting to face a Sunderland side determined to make a mark on their long-awaited return to the top flight, having won the Sky Bet Championship final at Wembley. “They are back in the Premier League now and I am sure they will be really excited and focused,” said Potter, whose team finished 14th last season. For us, it is about what we can do and trying to match the positivity of the environment.” (PA Media) Some Bournemouth team news ahead of tonight’s opener at Anfield. The Cherries will be without Justin Kluivert, Ryan Christie and Lewis Cook. Dutch forward Kluivert has been unable to train due to an issue which has taken longer than expected to heal, Scottish midfielder Christie has only recently returned to full training and the suspended Cook is also recovering from injury. Winger Luis Sinisterra is another player not expected to make the trip to Anfield as he nears full fitness following long-term injury. Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola told a press conference: “Justin hasn’t been training with us and won’t play. Ryan has been training this week with us, which is positive. It’s too early for him to play as he hasn’t done any pre-season. He hasn’t done a lot of things for a lot of weeks, so it’s too early – but it’s good to have him back on the pitch with the group.” Iraola is also expected to be without Dango Ouattara after it was reported Brentford have agreed a deal worth up to £42.5million for the forward and he was scheduled for a medical at the Gtech Community Stadium. (PA Media) Apparently, The Opta Supercomputer makes Liverpool 69.4% favourites to beat Bournemouth tonight. A few more fun facts here... The Reds have won their last six home league games against Bournemouth by an aggregate scoreline of 23-2. Liverpool haven’t lost their opening league game in any of the last 12 seasons, winning nine of them. Their last campaign to start with a loss was 2012-13, Brendan Rodgers’ first season in charge, when they lost 3-0 at West Bromwich Albion. The Reds’ unbeaten stretch is the longest current run without defeat on MD1 of any Premier League side. Mo Salah has scored more goals (9) and registered more goal involvements (14) on first matchdays of Premier League campaigns than any other player. Great news for completists: our 20th and final Premier League team preview has dropped. We close with Ben Fisher’s analysis of Wolves. Thanks John. Yes, I was spinning a few discs in a Bradford watering hole last night actually. Sham 69, Buzzcocks and Jilted John on the playlist for those interested. Most in the pub weren’t. As for “Kid” Jensen. “In his personal life, David is married to Iceland-born Guðrún. He loves his football and supports Crystal Palace FC, where he is Chairman of Crystal Palace F.C. Vice-President’s Club.” Your lunchtime companion will be West Yorkshire’s answer to David “Kid” Jensen, David Tindall. Ian Copesake gets in touch: “Hürzeler’s comment on Baleba’s new trim is very revealing as the old hippy adage was recently proven by Darwin Núñez: change your hair, change your club.“ Almost…cut my hair… Graeme Neill gets in touch and has this to say: “As great as it is to book a £24m(!) profit on Ben Doak, it is always a shame when a young player doesn’t quite follow through on the potential they once showed. I know not everyone can be a Trent but for every one of him, there are countless Rhian Brewsters, Sheyi Ojos, Ben Woodburns and so on.” Here’s our story on the Doak coming in. Some further transfer news below: Bayern Munich have opened talks with Chelsea over a deal for Christopher Nkunku. The France forward has fallen out of favour and is one of several attackers expected to leave Stamford Bridge before the transfer window shuts. Nkunku never really got a run at Chelsea. There’s a player there. Perhaps. Bournemouth are closing in on a deal to sign the Liverpool forward Ben Doak for £25m. The 19-year-old will move on for a huge profit on the £600,000 Liverpool paid Celtic in training compensation in 2022. The Scotland international has been linked with umpteen Premier League clubs and Porto but is expected to remain in England. Doak’s upcoming switch to the south coast comes as Bournemouth’s Dango Ouattara is poised to join Brentford for up to £42.5m. Chelsea need a defender after Levil Colwill’s ACL injury. Will they buy one? It’s possible, according to manager Enzo Maresca. It’s always possible with Chelsea. “We are trying to find a solution internally, but the club know exactly what I think - we need a central defender - but we are looking internally.” An addendum to Howe’s stance on Isak. Asked whether the striker could ever play again for Newcastle, Howe said this: ““Yes, I believe there is, but of course discussions and talks would have to take place in order for that to happen.” Ben Fisher speaks to Aston Villa’s playmaker, Youri Tielemans. “I always feel like once I’m in that rhythm, I feel the best I can be, really. When I’m in that rhythm, you just play, recover, play, recover, and you just get used to it and hopefully, I can do that again. We’re obviously well tracked by medical and technical staff – there are a lot of things going on backstage, I would say, where you have to just give your body the best chance possible to perform.” Noel Patrick has a suggestion: “You really should have a feature on Mondays to evaluate how the previous weekend’s “10 things to look out for...” went.” I’ll put it to the editorial board. Eddie Howe – and his nephew – have had quite the summer in the recruitment game. Of Alexander Isak, Howe would not say whether he will play against Aston Villa. Vibes: doubtful. Instead, the signing of Aston Villa’s Jacob Ramsey is a useful addition. I am really pleased, it has been a slow burner this summer. We tried to be active early, that didn’t happen. Then you’re trying to turn things in a positive way. Gradually piece by piece we have been becoming stronger. We have quality players coming in. The top end of the pitch is not ideal, but we have time. “In early pre-season, I have not shied away from it being a difficult time. You could see that in our performances. But the players are strong mentally, the mood has been good, performances recently have been better. The group has reacted well. Sometimes these things can have a good effect, and we were close anyway. These things can unify you in a way you didn’t know possible.” On Isak: “There has been no change. All my focus is on Aston Villa tomorrow. Isak’s situation has been clear for a while and that will continue to be the case. I’ve had a great relationship with him, you need that partnership with every player. I have to work really closely with the player for his benefit, to try and improve them. I always want to be there for him. “I don’t think Isak would have done as well without that, his team mates, the supporters - he recognises that, he’s an intelligent person.” Fabian Hurzeler has had brief words to say on Manchester United’s pursuit of Carlos Baleba: “Very very very confident, that’s just my belief.” Brighton welcome Fulham tomorrow. Now, will Baleba play? Or be pulled out as Wissa has been by Brentford. “I didn’t see any change, he’s only changed his hair. I think that’s the change he’s made in the last two weeks. But overall he seems to be in a really good place, he’s enjoying it with his team-mates, he’s enjoying being a Brighton player. “I didn’t see any big changes and he’s an option to start tomorrow”. And on that bombshell, I’ll hand you over to John Brewin for more hot build-up. Enjoy. There’s a fair bit of talk ahead of the big Premier League kick-off that we could witness a four-team title race this season. This is how the bookies see it. The Manchester United price isn’t a misprint. 7/4 Liverpool 5/2 Arsenal 7/2 Manchester City 8/1 Chelsea 25/1 Man Utd 50/1 Tottenham, Newcastle 80/1 Aston Villa Howard Webb admits there is no way back to refereeing for scandal-hit official David Coote. We all love a bargain. Although, in Premier League terms these days, a £30m transfer constitutes a bargain. You get the point though and here Harry Paterson lists several players who could end up looking real value for money. Fancy some in-depth team-by-team Premier League previews? Here’s West Ham, the 19th of 20, and we’ll complete the set with Wolves later today. Click away and you’ll find links to all the others. If Europe’s elite could not contain Paris Saint-Germain last season, what chance is there for Ligue 1’s impoverished chasing pack? That’s the question asked by Luke Entwhistle in his latest column via Get French Football News. Today’s Rumour Mill has dropped. John Brewin takes you through the latest gossip which features Manchester United, Brighton, Fulham and Spurs among others. The Football Weekly pod squad have given their own musings on the new Premier League season. If you’re driving to a place an hour away today, you have one for the way out and for of the journey back. Or just sit in the sunshine somewhere and nod off halfway through the first one, perhaps waking after a fever dream involving Declan Rice throwing fruit at a dinosaur ridden by Howard Webb. Andy Hunter and Louise Taylor assess the chances of the Premier League’s three promoted teams and whether they can avoid the same fate suffered by recent predecessors. Will the song play out again? Florian Wirtz makes his Premier League debut tonight. With his control, vision, movement and weight of pass, he’s a delightful footballer and it’s easy to see why Liverpool paid the big bucks. Arne Slot is thrilled to have the German on board but offered a tinge of realism in his press conference. Here’s Barney Ronay as the starting gun prepares to fire on the new Premier League season. There are very good reasons why this thing has become the world’s dominant pop cultural stage. It works. No matter how sated you might have become by the end of the last one, there is always renewal and fresh hunger. Albeit with an even stronger sense this time of shifting planes, hard lines dissolving, a Premier League that is, for the first time in some time, a little menaced by omens, portents and notes of horn-parping rapture. Let’s get straight into it by welcoming back an old favourite. Ladies and Gentleman, I give you 10 things… It’s back! The Premier League is back! A whopping 83 days since the 2024/25 season came to an end, champions Liverpool get the new 2025/26 campaign underway with a home game against Bournemouth tonight. Of course, we’ve hardly seen a ball kicked inbetween bar a dramatic Women’s Euros, a bonkers one-sided Champions League final, a turgid Europa League final, entertaining renewals of the Community Shield and Super Cup, rough-and-tumble action in the Championship, League One and League Two, key Champions League qualifiers, clue-gathering pre-season friendlies… you get the idea. But let’s not spoil the ‘it’s back’ narrative because now are empty lives are about to be filled again. We’ll have an absolute raft of scene setters for the big kick-off which starts at Anfield tonight and concludes at Elland Road on Monday via a Matchweek 1 which also features five games on Saturday (just three at 3pm) and three on Sunday. Will we have a four-way title race? Will the three promoted sides go straight back down? How much improvement do Manchester United and Spurs have in them after hideous finishes last time? Will Alexander Isak move from Tyneside to Merseyside? Buckle up, it’s time to find out!
