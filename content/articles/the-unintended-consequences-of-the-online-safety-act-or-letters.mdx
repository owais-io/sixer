  George Billinge says that many age assurance technologies delete their
  personal data after age has been confirmed, while some providers of virtual
  private networks (VPNs) sell their data to brokers (Everything the right – and
  the left – are getting wrong about the Online Safety Act, 1 August). But there
  is a key difference: we can choose which VPN to use, but the choice of which
  age assurance technology to use is with the platform. When a platform I use to
  talk to my friends insisted I verify my age, I wasn’t given a choice about
  which age verification service would get my driving licence. I was expected to
  trust that the platform had made a good decision with my best interests at
  heart. That’s a pretty big ask. Instead, I elected to sign up for a VPN. I
  then paid for it with a payment processor of my choice, one with a proven
  security record. I spent several days considering and comparing the numerous
  options before selecting one that doesn’t keep any data – with audits and
  court successes to prove it. At every step of the process, I was able to
  choose who I was trusting with my personal data. I might consider going
  through the age verification process later – when I get the choice about which
  service to show my driving licence to. Assuming, of course, that requiring age
  verification for a group of adults in their 40s to share pet photos and
  complain about work is ultimately deemed to be within the scope of the
  legislation. Age verification on porn sites sounds reasonable, but it seems
  that many platforms are using the Online Safety Act as an excuse to conduct a
  data grab on a massive scale. We should be wary about who is asking for our ID
  when the spirit of the law is being so blatantly abused. Alex Treryth St
  Austell, Cornwall • George Billinge’s focus on tech companies such as Facebook
  unfortunately echoes the flawed thinking behind the Online Safety Act itself.
  While the act tries to distinguish between large tech companies and smaller
  independent sites, most of the legislation was only written with Meta and
  their like in mind. In practice, this means that any site that contains
  user-submitted content, be that a volunteer-run hobbyist forum or a recipe
  blog with a comment section, is subject to the same rules (and same fines) as
  Facebook or X. However, unlike these companies, these smaller sites do not
  have the teams of lawyers to pore over Ofcom’s 1,700-plus pages of guidance,
  and instead are choosing to either block UK visitors or shut down entirely.
  Rather than curtailing the power of big tech, as Billinge suggests, the Online
  Safety Act only entrenches their power further, by making it impossible for
  anyone else to comply. Jonathan Coates Bristol
