  The Count of Monte Cristo 9pm, U&amp;Drama Sam Claflin and Jeremy Irons star
  in a new epic adaptation of the swashbuckling story by Alexandre Dumas. Edmond
  Dantès (Claflin) is a young sailor returning to Marseille to marry love of his
  life Mércèdes (Ana Girardot). But he has ruffled the feathers of two peers,
  who conspire to get him locked up in an island prison (“No one leaves there
  alive”). However, Edmond meets Abbé Faria (Irons) who will help him to escape
  15 years later and claim his revenge. HR Beethoven’s Fifth at the Proms
  6.50pm, BBC Two “Dah, dah, dah, dahhhh!” Those unmistakable notes open
  Beethoven’s Fifth in this Prom, which is performed by the Scottish Chamber
  Orchestra and conducted by Maxim Emelyanychev. Before that, though, French
  pianist Alexandre Kantorow – who played at the Paris 2024 Olympics opening
  ceremony – delivers Saint-Saëns’ “Egyptian” piano concerto. HR Billy Joel: And
  So It Goes 9pm, Sky Documentaries The original Piano Man looks back on a
  rollercoaster life and career in this two-part profile, which has gained extra
  poignancy after the 76-year-old’s recent brain disorder diagnosis. As well as
  Joel himself, Springsteen, McCartney, Pink and Nas weigh in on his legacy.
  Concludes Sunday. Graeme Virtue Annika 9.10pm, BBC One Although this
  Glasgow-set series (first shown on U&amp;Alibi) frequently teeters into cop
  show cliche, Nicola Walker’s socially awkward detective Annika Strandhed lends
  it a quirky edge. She’s got her work cut out for her as series two begins,
  with a gnarly drowning video and a victim who was last seen “pished and
  mouthy”. Hannah J Davies Griff’s Great American South 9.10pm, Channel 4 Griff
  Rhys Jones travels from the Atlantic to the Gulf and takes in all the US deep
  south has to offer en route. First up, in Tennessee he learns how a dam
  created in the 30s helped to forge the atomic bomb. Then, in Nashville, it’s
  all about the music and dancing. HR Suspicion 11.35pm, ITV1 Katherine begins
  doubting Martin – the one person she thought she could rely on, while Eddie
  claims he’s secretly working for her, in the penultimate episode. Meanwhile,
  there’s a tense showdown and a bombshell, before things get really messy. Ali
  Catterall Film choice The Thicket, 9.20am, 6.05pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Peter
  Dinklage heads up this impressively bleak neo-western, as a bounty hunter on
  the trail of a kidnapped girl. Ostensibly in the same redemptive vein as The
  Searchers, it’s closer in flinty spirit to something like The Revenant. His
  high body count decorating the snowy wilderness, Dinklage is as formidable as
  usual – but almost outmatched by Juliette Lewis as Cut Throat Bill, the
  misleadingly named varmint he’s pursuing. Director Elliott Lester goes in hard
  on seedy saloon atmospherics and a Darwinian survivalist vibe. Phil Hoad Live
  sport International Rugby Union: Australia v British &amp; Irish Lions,
  9.30am, Sky Sports Main Event The final Test from Sydney, with Lions captain
  Maro Itoje (pictured above) aiming for a 3-0 series win. Test Cricket: England
  v India, 10.15am, Sky Sports Cricket The third day of the fifth and final Test
  from the Oval in London. Golf: Women’s Open, noon, Sky Sports Golf Day three
  of the major from Royal Porthcawl. Cycling: Tour de France Femmes, 12.30pm,
  TNT Sports 1 Stage eight from Chambéry to Saint-François-Longchamp. Racing:
  Glorious Goodwood, 1pm, ITV1 The final day, featuring the Stewards’ Cup at
  3.05pm. • The headline of this article was amended on 2 August 2025. An
  earlier version misspelled the surname of Sam Claflin.
