  I was pulling out of our driveway one holiday, about to embark on an epic
  multi-hour trip, when I realised something was off. It wasn’t a major problem
  – no punctured tyre or busted door handle – simply that my maps app wouldn’t
  connect to my phone’s music player any more. An “update” during the night had
  stolen the function away, robbing me of the ability to change my music and
  track where I was on the map at the same time. It’s things like this that make
  automatic updates the mundane bane of my existence. The promise of forced
  software patches is that they improve the software and apps we use every day –
  make them more convenient, maintain our security and so on. But what actually
  happens most of the time is that updates change perfectly fine tech – now it
  sucks. Was I finally used to how my inbox works, secure in the knowledge that
  buttons weren’t going to move randomly around? Too bad – it’s entirely
  different now! How about that handy feature I used all the time, like
  YouTube’s community-contributed subtitles or my running app’s ability to check
  my historical statistics? Sorry, it’s been completely deleted or placed behind
  a paywall. The practice invokes paranoia, too: I’ve found myself deep in
  Reddit threads full of people convinced the latest operating system update
  halved their phone’s battery life. Did it? Who can say? It’s one reason I eye
  “smart” appliances with wifi access with deep suspicion; I’m not scared of
  Hollywood hackers or a sentient robot uprising, but I dread the broken
  updates, vanished features or forced additions I don’t want. I fear some
  anonymous developer on the other side of the planet can push a button and
  overnight make the apps and software I use worse. It’s bad enough half the
  programs on my PC are riddled with the latest GenAI tech-fad rubbish; wait
  until the fridge makers decide I need it too. Would we tolerate anything else
  that got worse over time, not as a result of normal wear and tear but because
  the manufacturer suddenly decided it should? A hammer that had the nail-puller
  mysteriously removed unless you paid for some stupid new subscription? A
  faucet whose creator decided actually they don’t want hot water and so neither
  should you? Absolutely not. I’ve learned to live without my maps and audio
  controller connectivity. But it still rankles – a constant reminder that maybe
  living a more disconnected life, far from the tendrils of the faceless
  corporations’ incessant updates, wouldn’t be all that bad.
