  just painful

  Welcome to Wrexham is one of those TV shows that has moved its genre up a
  level. After years of glossy “behind-the-scenes” documentaries that were just
  another part of million-dollar sports franchises’ marketing portfolios, the
  story of unlikely celebrity investors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney taking
  the extremely unlikely decision to buy AFC Wrexham was an unexpected tonic and
  a worldwide hit. Inevitably, imitations are now spawning, with Amazon last
  month debuting the underwhelming Built in Birmingham, about NFL superstar Tom
  Brady’s half-hearted involvement in Birmingham City. Necaxa should have better
  prospects, since it’s on Disney+, the same platform as Welcome to Wrexham, and
  Reynolds and McElhenney are in it. But all the peculiar magic of the parent
  show is painfully absent. Club Necaxa was the biggest team in Mexico City
  until the turn of the millennium, when it fell into decline, outspent and
  outplayed by its city rivals Club América, Cruz Azul and Pumas. So in 2003,
  Necaxa relocated an hour and a half’s flight north to Aguascalientes. The
  Mexican first division abandoned promotion and relegation in 2020, so Necaxa’s
  elite status is secure, but in its new home it has found it hard to make the
  playoffs, let alone challenge for the league title. Desperate Housewives star
  Eva Longoria, who has diversified from acting and directing into commercial
  ventures, was part of the consortium that invested in Necaxa in 2021. The
  documentary begins in April 2024 and proceeds as if Longoria were the sole
  financial saviour of the club, nicknaming her La Patrona (“the boss”) and
  largely relying on her to fill us in on Necaxa’s history and desired future.
  As for Longoria herself: she grew up in Texas with a father of Mexican descent
  who had longed for a son but found joy in sharing his love of the Dallas
  Cowboys with his youngest daughter, Eva, who later married a Mexican
  businessman and moved to Mexico City. Having spent her early career as an
  English-speaking American whose Latina looks limited the roles she was
  offered, Longoria is now ensconced in Mexican life without feeling as if she
  fully belongs there or in the US. In her conversations with the camera, the
  problem with the series becomes clear: the stakes are too low. Longoria would
  like to recapture the excitement of the Cowboys winning the Super Bowl, and
  she’d like to win the respect of the club’s players and staff, despite her
  Spanish being “horrible”. But these are just things that would be quite nice
  for her. They’re not enough for us to invest. Longoria’s interactions with
  people from the club tend to involve her laughing uproariously at nothing
  while everyone else politely sits there. Similarly, the players’ backstories
  are workaday recollections of training hard as youngsters, with jumpers for
  goalposts (or in the case of midfielder Diego “Chili” Gómez, piles of dirt)
  and great odds to overcome. The predicament of the club isn’t laden with
  jeopardy, either: Necaxa may not have won the top division for a while, but at
  least they’re in it. It’s as if Reynolds and McElhenney had bought Aston Villa
  or Everton instead of a non-league club on the verge of oblivion. The people
  of Aguascalientes, meanwhile, are indifferent towards Necaxa, which is a
  relatively new addition to the area and is just a bit frustratingly rubbish.
  If it keeps losing, they’ll shrug and go back to supporting Club América, or
  Guadalajara giants Chivas. In Wrexham, it felt as if the futures of the club
  and the town were existentially intertwined, but stories of fans whose
  devotion to football is a key part of their identity aren’t in evidence here,
  because nobody feels that way about Necaxa. This is more about Eva Longoria
  than any ordinary folk. It’s difficult, then, to care about whether Necaxa
  bounce back, but here come extensive match highlights anyway, with all the
  familiar grammar of the modern football doc. The action is filmed at ground
  level, more cinematically than standard live coverage, with plenty of reaction
  shots from the crowd and (more often) the directors’ box, accompanied by
  conveniently informative commentary that may or may not be authentic
  recordings made at the time. A switch to slow motion and a dip in the music
  signal that someone’s about to score. When Necaxa get slapped about by
  Monterrey in the final game of the 2024 season, it’s time to call on “Los
  Gringos”: Reynolds and McElhenney, minority investors in the club and
  executive producers of the series, pop up to lend their trademark
  unequal-buddy comedy to the show – they’ve worked up a gag about the less
  successful and busy Rob making Ryan look bad by spending more time learning
  Spanish – and to give Longoria tips via FaceTime. “We’re scared of La
  Patrona!” says Reynolds, with his usual nervous self-deprecation. Longoria
  laughs, heartily, and on her own. Necaxa is on Disney+
