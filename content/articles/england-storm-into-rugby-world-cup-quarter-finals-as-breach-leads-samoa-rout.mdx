  In a David v Goliath match, the giants England won a brutal encounter against
  Samoa which displayed the disparity between nations as 11 of the Red Roses
  shared 14 tries in a colossal win. Half of Samoa’s squad had to fundraise to
  be able to attend this Rugby World Cup with no contracts in place, and some
  have taken unpaid leave from their jobs to represent their country. England,
  on the other hand, have been a professional outfit for more than five years
  and have now swept aside their opponents in 59 of their last 60 matches, that
  one loss coming in the last World Cup final. Among the try scorers as England
  reached the quarter-finals was the hat-trick heroine Jess Breach, and the
  first try was a special one for the 27-year-old as it was her 50th for her
  country. Breach is only the fifth Red Roses player to score 50 tries, after
  Sue Day, Nicky Crawford, Emily Scarratt and Marlie Packer. The centre Meg
  Jones got on the board twice, and had not been in the starting XV at the
  beginning of this week, but an injury to Scarratt led to her promotion. The
  Cardiff-born centre’s contributions across the pitch were outstanding as her
  prowess in an England shirt only grows. Another bright spark for England was
  player-of-the-match Helena Rowland’s kicking from the tee. From the tries she
  missed only three, but slotted kicks from every angle, with her performance
  potentially leading fans to want her to be starting in the No 10 shirt for the
  rest of this tournament; Zoe Harrison and Holly Aitchison are also vying for
  the place, but Rowland’s versatility across the backline is likely to mean she
  will operate at 23 to cover any potential injuries or tactical changes. There
  was an air of unfamiliarity between the two teams, the last time they faced
  one another coming in 2014. None of the Samoan players had competed against
  England before, while Natasha Hunt and Packer were the only Red Roses in the
  matchday 23 in thatteam 11 years ago, which led Abi Burton to say in the
  build-up England were expecting Samoa “to throw the kitchen sink” at them,
  which was definitely the case. Samoa’s physicality was their biggest strength,
  with huge hits throughout the encounter. Half an hour before kick-off the rain
  started, and was off and on all match, perhaps adding to the amount of
  handling errors. Despite play not being the cleanest at times, it took less
  than three minutes for England to score, and Jones ran a great line to go
  over. The wing Breach scored next, with the prop Sarah Bern and Jones again
  having the bonus point wrapped up in the 16th minute. For the fifth try
  England’s scrum pack demolished Samoa’s before the No 8 Maddie Feaunati
  pounced on the rolling ball. The hooker Lark Atkin-Davies then got in on the
  action and the scrum-half Lucy Packer was next over. The hairs on the back of
  everyone’s neck in Northampton stood up as the stands came alive when Samoa
  entered their 22 for the first time in the closing moments of the first half,
  but England managed to turn them over with the half-time score 47-0. BBC
  viewers were treated to an interview with Lioness legend Chloe Kelly, who was
  in attendance supporting England. The second half began with Samoa winning a
  scrum penalty and they opted to kick for the posts. The fly-half Harmony Vatau
  slotted the kick to score their first World Cup points in 11 years. Samoa
  didn’t qualify in 2017, withdrew from qualification for the 2021 tournament
  because of the pandemic, and drew a blank against Australia last week. It was
  arguably the moment of the match with the entire team having their hands in
  the air and roaring in celebration, among the loudest cheers of the afternoon.
  England were soon back in the driving seat with Kelsey Clifford scoring and
  Breach next over. The Red Roses were their own worst enemies for the next
  period with fumbled lineouts and knock-ons thwarting more tries, but they
  scored again through the replacement prop Mackenzie Carson before the fly-half
  Rowland, the captain Packer, Breach for her hat-trick and the wing Claudia
  Moloney-MacDonald rounded off the scores. Another benefit for England is that
  it seemed the team came through the 80 minutes without injury, though Jones
  and Feaunati needed on-pitch treatment. Women’s rugby is no doubt growing, as
  evidenced by the 13,615 fans in the stands, but this game once again shows the
  huge gap that needs to be closed between nations. For now England march on,
  with their final pool opponent being Australia next Saturday, while Samoa take
  on the USA.
