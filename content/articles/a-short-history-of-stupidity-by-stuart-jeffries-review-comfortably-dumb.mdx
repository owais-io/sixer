  Stupidity, no question, can be just as rich and subtle as its opposite. Three
  and a half decades on, I still sometimes meditate on what a school friend of
  mine said in a here’s-a-profound-thought tone of voice: “I’d rather be stupid
  than happy”. In this clever book, Stuart Jeffries starts out at a double
  disadvantage, though. First: he has an excellently snappy title but it’s open
  to question whether stupidity can be said to have a history in any meaningful
  sense. The quality of stupidity is just, sort of, there; and there’s lots of
  it. Could you write a history of happiness, or bad luck, or knees? You’d be on
  firmer ground, as he recognises, historicising the concept of stupidity: a
  short history, in other words, of “stupidity” – how successive societies and
  thinkers have defined and responded to reason’s derr-brained secret sharer. As
  an intellectual historian who has written smart and chewy popular books about
  the Frankfurt School (Grand Hotel Abyss) and postmodernism (Everything, All
  the Time, Everywhere), he certainly has the chops for it. But then there’s the
  second problem: definitions. Is stupidity the same thing as ignorance? As
  foolishness? As the unwillingness to learn (AKA obtuseness, or what the Greeks
  called amathia)? As the inability to draw the right conclusions from what you
  have learned? Is it a quality of person or a quality of action? On and off, in
  ordinary usage, it’s all of these. It’s a know-it-when-you-see-it (except in
  yourself) thing. Perhaps inescapably, therefore, Jeffries makes a number of
  nice philosophical distinctions about the meaning of the term – and then goes
  back to using it in the know-it-when-you-see-it sense, so his discussion
  wanders through whole fields of its meanings without ever quite erecting a
  boundary fence. In a way, you could see this book not as a history of
  stupidity but as a slant history of its various opposites. It’s an amiable and
  rambling tour through the history of philosophy, looking at the idea of
  rationality and its limitations. If it’s stupid not to seek the truth, is it
  not even more stupid to suppose there’s a truth to be sought? The western
  ancients were in the first camp; and their special distinction – thank you,
  Socrates – was to see reason and virtue as being directly connected. It’s only
  with the Enlightenment that stupidity started to be seen as a cognitive rather
  than a moral failing. (Though when we later meet Hannah Arendt’s reflections
  on Eichmann, on the banality of mind that made Nazi evil possible, we perhaps
  return to the older view.) There’s an interesting early chapter on the eastern
  traditions. Daoism and Confucianism and Buddhism see wisdom and virtue as
  linked, too; though wisdom in these cases is associated less with deductive
  rationality than with a submission to the natural order of things. Daoist
  “wu-wei”, or “effortless action” (going with the flow) is the key. Western
  individualism, according to a scholar Jeffries quotes, leaves us with selves
  resembling “a kind of avocado” with a nub of ego at its centre, whereas in the
  mysterious east there are to be found “flexi-selves” of the sort you can’t buy
  in the grocery aisle. It’s not all straight philosophy. Jeffries gives us
  affectionate readings of Don Quixote and Flaubert’s Bouvard and Pécuchet, dips
  into Shakespeare’s fools and the rich menu of stupidities available in King
  Lear, as well as making the odd excursus into cognitive science. And the
  abstract question of whether rationalism is the greatest stupidity of all is
  given concrete force in Jeffries’s chapters about IQ tests (their inventor, we
  discover, would have been horrified by the stupid way they came to be used),
  eugenics, the “mass stupidity” of totalitarianism and the “structural
  stupidity” of life under late capitalism. Adorno and Horkheimer’s Dialectic of
  Enlightenment – which draws a line from utopian rationalism to the camps – is
  the touchstone here, but the whole rationalism-skeptic crew, from Foucault and
  Derrida to John Gray, get a look-in. Less high-mindedly, Donald Trump and
  Boris Johnson also get it in the neck. This is a learned and often
  exhilarating book, and it’s a bit all over the place – but, given the subject
  matter, it’d be stupid to expect otherwise. • A Short History of Stupidity by
  Stuart Jeffries is published by John Wiley &amp; Sons (£25). To support the
