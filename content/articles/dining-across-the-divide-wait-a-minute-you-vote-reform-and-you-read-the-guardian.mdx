  Michael, 35, Andover Occupation Engineering manager Voting record Generally a
  small-c conservative, has voted Tory in every election but 2024, when he voted
  Reform as a protest against the Conservative government. Doesn’t see himself
  voting Reform in 2029 Amuse bouche Buys individual pieces of Lego to make his
  own creations. For his 30th birthday, his fiancee bought him the makings of a
  3ft wingspan Tiger Moth biplane Bernard, 75, Salisbury Occupation Retired
  maths teacher Voting record Labour or Lib Dem – whoever is most likely to beat
  the Tories Amuse bouche Spent seven years teaching in Africa, first in Kenya,
  then in Malawi For starters Bernard He was very young, very smartly dressed. I
  wasn’t scruffy, but I didn’t have his polish. A nice guy; a bit diffident to
  start with, but we both were, really. It’s a strange situation. Once we got
  talking, we got on fine. Michael He seemed welcoming, more than warm. Bernard
  I had buffalo chicken wings, followed by haddock, followed by a fantastic
  sticky toffee pudding. Perhaps I overdid it a bit. Michael I had pork belly to
  start, and then a Portuguese beef stew. The big beef Bernard We both agreed
  that we had to get away from fossil fuels, but his solution is nuclear. If
  there is an accident, they tend to be disastrous accidents – he had all kinds
  of arguments for why Chornobyl couldn’t happen here, but even Sellafield in
  the early years, leaking radioactive water into the Irish Sea, was awful.
  Michael We should be pushing hard for nuclear, whereas Bernard leaned heavily
  into renewables. My reasons are the reliability of nuclear, the compactness.
  It’s unfair to judge nuclear on Chornobyl. The causes of that disaster were
  largely unqualified people and political interference, rather than science. It
  was the politicians running it, not the engineers. Bernard The cost of Hinkley
  Point is immense. The French are building it, aren’t they? He thinks the
  reason why that’s happening is because the red tape in this country is so
  terrible. And what do you do with the waste? You bury it. But you’ve haven’t
  got rid of it, you’ve just left it for future generations. Michael My response
  to the half-life issue, which he raised, is that we take very diffuse
  radioactive material and concentrate it – so it’s not like we’re creating this
  deadly thing; it’s a natural element, or minerals rather, that’s been
  concentrated. So it’s a long problem but it’s not a big problem. Sharing plate
  Bernard I think Brexit is a done deal and I’m pretty sure that it won’t be
  reversed any time soon. Although I was furious about it, I do tend to think:
  what can we do? It’s like being really cross there was an earthquake. Michael
  We voted opposite ways but agreed that it was time to move on. It wouldn’t
  have happened this way were I dictator and in charge of everything, and I’m
  not particularly happy with the results, but we live in a democracy and you’ve
  got to accept compromise. For afters Bernard We both felt there should be more
  consensus in politics. PMQs is a bit of a joke: it doesn’t mean anything –
  it’s like a tennis match. If you can make a select committee work, where
  people from all political parties manage to meet and agree on things, why
  can’t you make law like that? Michael Towards the end of the evening, he
  mentioned Wes Streeting’s new plan for the NHS. It’s nice that it’s a 10-year
  plan and is supported by the shadow health secretary. So that’s almost a
  glimmer of hope against the normal discourse of A says this and B says,
  “That’s bad because A said it.” If both sides say it’s a good thing, then it’s
  probably a good thing. Takeaways Bernard I certainly had an enjoyable evening.
  I don’t think I made a friend, in so far as he’s half my age. I said to him,
  “Wait a minute, you vote Reform, and you read the Guardian?” It turned out his
  fiancee is a teacher and she encouraged him to do it. Michael We walked out of
  the restaurant together, chatted as we walked down the street. We didn’t
  exchange numbers; I’ll never see him again, but I very much enjoyed talking to
  somebody I’d never normally have crossed paths with. I almost felt guilty
  about how much I enjoyed it. Additional reporting: Kitty Drake • Bernard and
  Michael ate at The Chapter House in Salisbury Want to meet someone from across
