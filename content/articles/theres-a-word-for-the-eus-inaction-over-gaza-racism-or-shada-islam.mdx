  The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and her team
  face growing criticism of the controversial EU-US tariff deal agreed in July.
  I am hoping for similar calls for accountability over the EU’s complicity in
  Israel’s unfolding genocide in Gaza. Such a reckoning is long overdue. I have
  watched in despair for almost two years as European governments have done
  little or nothing while Israel has devastated Gaza through bombings, targeted
  strikes and forced starvation after the 7 October attack by Hamas. There are
  so many sanctions at the EU’s disposal which they are still refusing to
  deploy; so many levers they are refusing to pull. The bloc is Israel’s biggest
  trading partner, accounting for 32% of Israel’s total trade in 2024. Yet at
  every meeting, EU leaders and foreign ministers have failed to secure the
  majority needed to suspend the EU-Israel association agreement. This despite
  pressure from Spain, Ireland and Slovenia, and despite the fact the EU’s own
  human rights experts have indicated that Israel is in breach of the accord’s
  human rights obligations. Even a modest commission proposal to partly suspend
  Israel from the EU’s €95bn Horizon Europe research programme – an initiative
  that the EU’s former foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has described as a
  “bad joke”, given the scale of Israel’s atrocities – remains blocked by
  Germany and Italy. Israeli exports to the EU actually rose in early 2024. The
  German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, says Berlin is now stopping exports of
  military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. But this follows
  almost two years of unabated military support: arms export licences from
  Germany alone amounted to €485m of equipment in the 19 months after 7 October.
  I understand Europe’s historical guilt, internal divisions and deep economic
  ties with Israel. But it is impossible to ignore a more uncomfortable truth:
  Europe’s political and moral paralysis over Gaza is intimately linked to the
  structural racism and violence which so many black, brown and Muslim Europeans
  face every day. It is clear to me that attitudes towards Gaza are shaped by an
  enduring colonial mentality that is embedded in the EU’s foreign, trade and
  migration policies. The same dehumanising logic applied to racialised
  Europeans and refugees from Africa, Asia and the Middle East is now in plain
  view in the EU’s abandonment of the Palestinian people. Europe’s domestic and
  external biases are feeding off and sustaining each other. This connection is
  not abstract. It is glaringly visible in the disparity of treatment of Ukraine
  and Gaza. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine was rightly condemned by the
  EU, which imposed severe and unprecedented sanctions on Moscow, gave more
  money to Kyiv and repeatedly condemned other states that did not follow suit.
  Palestinian lives, however, are treated as expendable, their suffering is
  minimised while children are robbed of their childhoods. The suffering in
  Gaza, framed as a humanitarian crisis rather than a deliberate political
  choice, is decontextualised, depoliticised and sanitised. EU policymakers
  should listen when the Palestinian-American academic Rashid Khalidi says this
  conflict is “the last colonial war in the modern age”. The moral reckoning
  over the EU’s inaction on Gaza cannot be partial or piecemeal. It must include
  a recognition of how Europe’s past and present intersect, not only when it
  comes to Palestine but in many of its actions on the global stage. An EU that
  sees itself as a defender of international law and global justice should be
  willing to have these difficult conversations – in fact, it should encourage
  them. But the largely Eurocentric EU-policy circles see such talk as divisive.
  Without serious self-examination and long overdue action, the EU’s very
  visible double standards will continue to undermine its democracy at home and
  its credibility abroad. An updating of the 2020 anti-racism action plan could
  provide a way forward. But for that to happen, measures to combat the current
  alarming state of EU-wide discrimination must be backed by clear-eyed
  reflections on Europe’s history. This too is overdue. The action plan has lost
  momentum and a recent bureaucratic reshuffle has sidelined Michaela Moua, the
  first EU anti-racism coordinator, in what many fear could further undermine
  the bloc’s equality agenda in the coming years. Still, public pressure and
  dissent within EU institutions, including among senior officials, is growing.
  Von der Leyen, who has been criticised for her unwavering pro-Israel bias, has
  come out against plans for an Israeli occupation of Gaza City. It is far from
  enough. Critics of the EU’s stance are right to decry its double standards,
  its betrayal of international law and the eroding of its own credibility.
  Israel’s plans for occupying the whole of Gaza must be stopped, food must be
  brought in urgently and there must be an immediate ceasefire. Any serious
  reckoning over the EU’s inaction in Gaza will remain incomplete without
  confronting the structural racism and lingering colonial hierarchies that
  still shape Europe’s worldview. Gaza has stripped away the pretence. The EU’s
  policymakers must finally confront these truths, however harsh, and act to
  dismantle them. Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs. She
