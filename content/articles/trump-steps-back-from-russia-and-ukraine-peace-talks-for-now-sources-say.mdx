  Donald Trump intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between
  their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to
  administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from
  the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The next stage in
  Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between
  Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian
  president, the officials said. Trump has told advisers in recent days that he
  intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have
  met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains
  unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort. In a
  phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also
  said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him
  in the first instance. “I just want to see what happens at the meeting. So
  they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”
  Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has
  acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more
  difficult than he had anticipated, after saying on the campaign trail last
  year he could achieve it in 24 hours. He has since sought a quick peace
  agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and
  said after his meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House
  on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting. A senior
  administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a
  “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be
  scheduled. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress
  and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting
  could take place. In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his
  national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials
  towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in
  the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.” After the
  meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around
  40 minutes. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two
  leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct
  talks between Russia and Ukraine. That statement signaled that a bilateral
  meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark
  Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has
  rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start
  of the war. At a news conference on Monday night after the White House
  meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump
  centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure
  Russia did not resume its invasion. Trump offered to contribute to security
  guarantees, but has since ruled out deploying US troops to be part of a
  military force on the ground in Ukraine. Any US assistance is expected to come
  in the form of intelligence sharing or possibly US air support. Previously,
  Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union”
  after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer
  Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective
  self-defense mandate. “We were able to win the following concession: that the
  United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real
  reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said. But Putin’s acceptance
  of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward. Sergei Lavrov,
  the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of
  the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately
  scoffed at, one official said. “The Ukrainian side proposed, and our
  delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would
  involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia,
  the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United
  Kingdom,” Lavrov said. After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined
  a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security
  guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine. It was not immediately
  clear whether that was part of the Ukraine weapons deal Trump announced last
  month.
