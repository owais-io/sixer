  Right, I’ll wrap things up there. There’ll be more coverage on its way when
  Venus Williams walks on to Arthur Ashe at 7pm local time – 25 years on from
  her first US Open singles title. Carlos Alcaraz will add to the show
  afterwards, but the story of the day so far is Madison Keys’ exit. Her slam
  season began with victory in Australia, but the return home has not been
  sweet. Tumaini Carayol has the victories of Cam Norrie and Jack Draper
  covered. Rune has won his second set tie-break, too. Worth getting into this
  interview by Donald McRae. And it is Tiafoe who takes the second set … with
  Nishioka smashing up his racket in frustration. A tribute to Medvedev? Now
  then, we’re heading to a second set tie-break between Tiafoe and Nishioka. The
  latter looks sad with life as he loses the first two points, his body language
  all over the place in this set. Tiafoe sends a 135mph serve screaming down the
  middle to go 3-0 up – frightening stuff. Nishioka is suddenly interested again
  as he wins two on his serve and a miscued Tiafoe forehand brings us to 3-3.
  Nishioka is on top after a cracking backhand return but Tiafoe takes the next
  two points and Nishioka, once again, looks a world of misery. But it’s
  Nishioka who leads 6-5 after winning a 20-shot rally, serving for the set. He
  wallops a forehand long and throws his racket. His antics are very watchable,
  to be fair. It’s 6-6 … Time to move over to Grandstand, with the 11th seed
  Holger Rune up against Botic van de Zandschulp. Rune took the first set 6-3
  and it’s 3-3 in the second as Van de Zandschulp – who reached the quarters
  here in 2021 – serves. Rune nails a forehand return and dictates the next
  rally to force deuce. Van de Zandschulp nets to give Rune advantage, but a
  booming serve down the middle brings the Dutchman back. He manages to hold,
  going up 4-3. Tiafoe soaks in the applause after a spectacular winner, holding
  his own at the net before retreating to close out an 11-shot rally with a
  passing backhand. The 17th seed levels things up at 3-3 in the second set. US
  fans have had to deal with a Keys loss … can Frances Tiafoe bring the joy on
  Arthur Ashe? After winning the first set against Yoshihito Nishioka 6-3, he’s
  now down 3-1 in the second. But Tiafoe, dressed in resplendent red – socks and
  headband included – breaks back comfortably to make it 3-2. Nishioka is
  absolutely furious with himself as he takes a seat. Here’s a write-up of
  Madison Keys’ shock defeat. So a tough runaround for Draper, taking him just
  past the three-hour mark. It was Gomez who launched more winners – 50 to
  Draper’s 38 – but the fifth seed’s overall quality won out. He’s dealing with
  that dodgy left arm, too, but he’s also done the job. On to the next. Draper
  speaks: “I wasn’t too sure if I was going to make it here this year but we did
  a great job with the team since Wimbledon to get myself back on court. It
  wasn’t my finest performance but credit to my opponent, he played some
  outstanding tennis and I look forward to hopefully improving and getting
  better as the tournament carries on. I’m not putting too much expectation on
  myself. I’ve put in the work, if I can get that level back I’m going to be
  tough to beat.” Draper shows Gomez the power of his forehand to go up 30-0
  and, suddenly, he’s got himself three match points. And how about that to win:
  he slides to hit the flattest down-the-line forehand winner. Gomez produces a
  passing forehand winner, but Draper’s approach was never that convincing.
  Draper tries to serve and volley but Gomez beats his man once again with a
  deft forehand to make it 30-all. Gomez fumes at himself after losing the next
  point but he dictates the one after with a whopping forehand return. Deuce.
  Draper holds with an ace followed by a down-the-line winner – he leads 5-2 in
  the fourth set, a game away from settling the match. Gomez faces a break point
  … but he pummels a forehand winner to escape trouble. Another unforced error
  gives Draper a chance to break and he takes it this time, Gomez – on the
  attack – finding the net. Draper leads the fourth set 4-2. Draper races
  through his hold but Gómez remains the man smiling at the moment, suggesting
  he’s got plenty more in the tank. Draper’s average first-serve speed is down
  on his usual efforts but he leads the fourth set 3-2. Draper is 2-1 up in the
  fourth set as Gómez launches into his lightning serves … oops, double fault. A
  thunderous serve down the middle allows Gómez to move to 30-15. Draper
  overhits a forehand and an ace completes the hold. It’s 2-2 in the fourth.
  Right then, so while I was away Gómez took a set off Draper and Madison Keys
  departed the competition. An eventful hour. Another ICYMI: Elena Rybakina, the
  ninth seed, won 6-3, 6-0 against Julieta Pareja. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 7-6 (7), 0-1
  Draper (*denotes next server) Draper takes the first game easily enough,
  although Henman is worried by the relatively low speed of his serve, saying it
  suggests he is struggling with this arm injury. Now, over to Taha. Good night.
  Draper v Gomez is now two-and-a-half hours deep. “Not what you want at the
  start of a grand slam,” says one of the commentators. Draper will serve to
  open the fourth set. Frances Tiafoe, the No 17 seed, has just kicked off
  against Yoshihito Nishioka. Gomez is ranked 203 in the world, by the way. He’s
  been erratic, but on this form, he could be ranked a lot higher. His power is
  something to behold. Gomez has a set point, and runs down a poor short ball by
  Draper, but clips it into the net! That was a horrible, nervy shot. Was that
  his only chance? No: more powerful stuff from the Argentinian. He earns
  another set point. And having saved a match point, he hammers an unstoppable
  forehand to the corner to win the third set! Gomez celebrates calmly,
  clenching his fist: he looks hyper-focused and very, very up for this. Gomez
  4-6, 5-7, 6-6 (tiebreak 6-6) Draper Draper aces his opponent for 6-5. It’s
  match point … but here he is again! Gomez crunches a gynormous forehand down
  the line to get it back to 6-6! Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 6-6 (5-5) Draper Quickly it’s
  2-0, the first mini-break for Draper coming from a winner that kisses the
  line. Then 3-0, but Draper then bizarrely miscues a forehand into the top
  tier, sending a souvenir to one lucky fan. At 4-2, Gomez wins the point with a
  ludicrous on-the-run forehand winner that he draws from outside the tramlines
  and into the corner. And that was after a brilliant cross-court effort from
  his opponent, too. At 4-4, Gomez dumps a forehand into the net, and Draper
  almost has one foot the second round with two serves to come. But Gomez won’t
  lie down! He wins the first point against the Draper serve and it’s 5-5 …
  Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 6-6 Draper Draper seals his service game to -15 and it’s a
  tie-break to settle this third set. Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 6-5 *Draper (*denotes next
  server) At 30-15 Gomez winds up another shattering forehand, arrowing it left
  to right across the court, but it fades just wide in the tramlines. “When
  you’re hitting it that hard, it doesn’t need to be on the line,” observes
  Henman in the commentary box. Still, Gomez rounds off the game quickly enough,
  and it’s 6-5. Draper must serve to stay in the set. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 5-5
  Draper (*denotes next server) And now Draper must serve to stay in the set. He
  does so, as efficiently as possible, unless you count the one point one by
  Gomez. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 4-4 Draper (*denotes next server) Draper has drawn
  level, meanwhile the commentators just said he was ‘unwell on the court’ while
  the TV director had switched to the Keys upset, code for vomiting I think. The
  Mexican Renata Zarazúa has knocked out the Australian Open champion and
  Illinois-born home hope! A huge upset in the first round of the women’s
  singles. 7-6 (10), 6-7 (3), 5-7 Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 4-3 *Draper (*denotes next
  server) Draper wins the first point again but is then worn down by a splendid
  display of hitting from his opponent, rounding off an attritional point with a
  lusty smash that bounces high into the stand. Gomez’s power comes to the fore
  again and at 30-30 Draper returns long to give a game point to his opponent.
  Then, Draper’s opponent completely mishits a double-handed backhand, and then
  fluffs a forehand into the net on the next point. Game point Draper and the
  chance of a break back … Gomez thrashes a couple of forehands to the corner,
  Draper gets them back, then the Argentinian floats an attempted drop shot into
  the net! Draper breaks back and he’s right back in the set. Gomez threw that
  away from 40-30, or was it more a case of impressive defence by Draper? *Gomez
  4-6, 5-7, 4-2 Draper (*denotes next server) Hold to love for Draper. We’ll see
  some more fireworks from Gomez up next, mark my words. Madison Keys, the No 6
  seed, is in a spot of trouble against Renata Zarazúa, ranked No 82. It’s 5-5
  in the final set on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 4-1 *Draper (*denotes
  next server) Gomez is going for broke here. He’s leaning into these forehands
  like a man possessed. He’s serving well too, and despite a very neat first
  point from Draper, sealed with a delicate drop-volley after a meaty hit to the
  back of the court, the Argentinian seals the game to -30. The final point is
  impressive too, hammering big forehands to either corner, then producing a
  sumptuous drop volley of his own to take the game. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 3-1 Draper
  (*denotes next server) “Draper will be looking to steady the ship right now,”
  says Henman on commentary. You can’t beat a bit of ship-steadying, and Draper
  eases to 40-0, then digs out a stunning half volley from the baseline to
  clinch the game which Gomez chases after but can’t get. Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 3-0
  *Draper (*denotes next server) Henman suggests Draper’s “arm is not 100 per
  cent”. Gomez, meanwhile, closes out the hold of serve in double-quick time and
  he’s flown out of the blocks to a 3-0 lead in the third set. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7,
  2-0 Draper (*denotes next server) At 30-0 Gomez winds up a huge forehand
  winner. He has an animated chat with his team, then produces another, arrowing
  a massively powerful forehand down the line that Draper has zero chance of
  getting anywhere close to. Quickly it’s 30-40 and then Gomez, standing waaaay
  behind the baseline, winds up several more massive forehands and forces an
  error, and that’s a break against Draper. Gomez roars with delight. That was
  an impressive game of “Well why not just go for it?” tennis. Gomez 4-6, 5-7,
  1-0 *Draper (*denotes next server) Draper forces 30-30, and then deuce, with
  an excellent cross-court winner on the run. But the Argentinian extinguishes
  any hope of a break for the Briton with one big serve, for his advantage, and
  then Draper hits a forehand just wide from the back of the court. That’s the
  game. Thanks Taha, hello everyone, what an unexpected pleasure. I’m going to
  nab a break. Luke McLaughlin will keep you company for the next hour. A
  forehand down the line moves Draper to set point … and an ace completes the
  job. After a brief wobble, he finds himself up 6-4, 7-5. Questions will be
  asked about that left arm injury and whether it was responsible for those
  double-faults. Draper is geeing himself up as he takes the first two points
  off Gómez’s serve, and the southpaw has two break points. He gets stuck with
  his footing and nets a forehand … but Gómez finds the net cord and Draper
  regains his break advantage. He’ll serve for the set again with a 6-5 lead.
  Draper has lost a bit of flow as he serves for the second set. A double-fault
  – his fourth of the set – is followed by a volley into the net, and Gómez has
  two break points … he takes the first and roars! We’re 5-5 in the second.
  Ooooh, Gómez has a chance to break after three Draper double-faults … but the
  former goes long. Deuce. Gómez launches a cracking forehand return to get
  himself another break point … but Draper escapes with an ace on his second
  serve. Gómez fumes with himself after a misplaced forehand, and Draper holds.
  A brief opening disappears. Draper leads 6-4. 5-3. Keys has been forced into
  another tie-break … she’s 5-2 down against Zarazúa. A forehand volley makes it
  5-3, but Keys double-faults: Zarazúa has three set points. She needs just one,
  sweeping a backhand to pull of a brilliant turnaround – she was 3-0 down in
  the set. It’s 7-6, 6-7, with Keys having accrued 66 unforced errors. Gómez
  saves two break points to get to deuce … but a double fault comes at a
  terrible time. The 28-year-old fights on, though, a backhand winner allowing
  him to hold. Draper leads 6-4, 3-2. Draper has got himself a break in the
  second set and he continues to deny Gómez any openings on his serve. The
  British No 1 leads 6-4, 3-1 and has little cause for concern. There’s been a
  proper turnaround in the Keys-Zarazúa contest. Zarazúa, who was 3-0 down,
  leads 5-4 and is serving for the second set. A double fault is a poor start,
  and she nets a volley moments later, prompting her to switch her racket. It
  doesn’t change much as Keys gets three break points. She fails to convert the
  first two but a whopping forehand makes it third time lucky. Keys leads 7-6,
  5-5. Draper has his serve swinging viciously to set up two set points. He
  needs just one, Gómez going a bit too heavy with a backhand slice. Draper
  takes the first set 6-4, a welcome return to the court. Draper has gone up a
  break against Gómez and advances to a 5-4 lead. The Argentinian is a
  28-year-old qualifier who made it to the second round at Roland Garros this
  year, his finest showing at a slam. Madison Keys seems to have found her
  rhythm after a mixed bag of a first set. She’s up 3-1 in the second against
  Renata Zarazúa … but here comes Zarazúa with two break points. She capitalises
  with the second opportunity; Keys had plenty of time to place a backhand but
  went long. Keys now leads 7-6, 3-2. Jack Draper launches two aces to make it
  2-2 against Gómez. The fifth seed is playing his first singles match since
  Wimbledon, having battled with a left arm injury. “It’s not something which
  I’m going to go out on Monday and feel like it’s holding me back at all,” he
  said the other day. Gómez sends down a couple of blistering aces himself to
  lead 3-2. Cam Norrie claims the second set and Sebastian Korda shakes hands,
  the American having received treatment on his back earlier. Korda buries his
  head in his towel. Poor guy. Norrie was up 7-5, 6-4. Jack Draper’s tournament
  has begun. He’s in action against Federico Agustín Gómez on Louis Armstrong.
  Keys, meanwhile, has claimed that first set with a 12-10 tiebreak. She’s not
  been at her best but she’s on the board. Keys double-faults for the fifth time
  in the set, taking us to 3-3 in the tiebreak. She’s racked up more than 30
  unforced errors and they continue to pile up, Keys’ forehand losing its radar
  as Zarazúa goes up 6-4. Keys saves the two set points and then another as they
  get to 9-9 … no one wants to win this set. Let’s get to Madison Keys, the
  sixth seed, who is serving to stay in the set: Renata Zarazúa leads 6-5 … and
  the underdog has two set points. Keys saves the first with a laser backhand,
  and a powerful forehand takes the game to deuce. Keys finds an ace at the
  perfect moment, and another down the middle to set up a tie-break. Krejcikova
  has her first match point but goes wide with a forehand. A double fault gives
  Krejcikova another chance but Mboko battles on. It takes a third match point
  for Krejcikova to convert, sending the promising 18-year-old home. Krejcikova
  has won nine of her 11 points at the net and she thunders a volley on her way
  to another game. She now leads 6-3, 5-2, with Mboko – tipped as one to watch
  this tournament – on her way out. Her heavily bandaged right wrist is getting
  some attention from the commentary team on Sky. Things get worse for Korda:
  he’s now getting some treatment on the court, his lower back getting rubbed.
  Victoria Mboko is up against it on Louis Armstrong against Barbora Krejcikova.
  The latter leads 4-1 in the second set. Cam Norrie is in control against
  Sebastian Korda, 2-0 up in the second set after taking the first. Korda’s
  troubles continue in the third game: when up to the net, he gets it all wrong
  with a straightforward smash. The American’s serve-and-volley isn’t bringing
  him all that much joy, but he does manage to hold. Norrie leads 7-5, 2-1.
  Madison Keys is up and running against Renata Zarazua on Arthur Ashe. Keys
  broke early but Zarazua has launched back; the latter leads 3-2 in the first
  set, with Keys serving. It’s all over for Petra Kvitova. Diane Parry triumphs
  6-1, 6-0 inside an hour and that brings an end to the career of the former
  world No 2. A two-time Wimbledon champion, French Open runner-up and an
  Olympic bronze in there too. Elsewhere, Cam Norrie has taken the first set 7-5
  against Sebastian Korda. Cam Norrie has three chances to break against
  Sebastian Korda … and he needs just one. Korda, up to the net, goes wide with
  a forehand and Norrie will serve for the first set: he’s up 6-5. Barbora
  Krejcikova has taken the first set against Victoria Mboko 6-3. The first point
  of the second set should be Mboko’s … but she overhits a volley. Korda goes
  long – just – with a forehand and Norrie has break point. But Korda matches
  Norrie’s trick in the previous game, launching an ace to get out of trouble. A
  passing forehand, from way behind the baseline, puts a smile on Norrie’s face:
  he’s got another break point. And it’s another ace from Korda! That’s his 10th
  of the match. Norrie gets his third chance to break with a backhand down the
  line but Korda’s serve is a serious force. The American battles on to take a
  5-4 lead in the first set. Korda has a break point against Norrie … but out
  comes an ace down the middle. Norrie’s then up to the net, a delightfully
  delicate volley bringing him the advantage. He escapes danger and we’re 4-4 in
  this rather even fight. Victoria Mboko has a chance to break against Barbora
  Krejcikova, but a backhand slice finds the net. Mboko goes long with a
  forehand to give her opponent a 4-2 lead in the first set. Diane Parry has won
  the first set 6-1 against Petra Kvitova. Here’s a great interview Kvitova –
  two-time Wimbledon champion – did before the tournament. Yep, there’s that big
  serve. Korda sends down two more aces to go 3-2 up against Norrie in the first
  set. Norrie holds to go 2-2 but he’s got a proper challenge against Korda’s
  serve, the 25-year-old American reeling off aces – he’s ticked off six inside
  the opening 20 minutes. Cam Norrie is 1-1 with Sebastian Korda, the latter on
  serve. Norrie takes him to deuce, but Korda responds with an ace … and then a
  double fault. Deuce once again. Korda advances inside the baseline to sweep a
  backhand winner but Norrie’s passing forehand brings deuce again. Korda holds
  his nerve after four deuces and leads 2-1 in the first set. Mboko, the 22nd
  seed, has a nervy start and is broken in the first game by Krejcikova. Petra
  Kvitova, who will retire from tennis after this tournament, is a break down
  against Diane Parry of France. The future is here at Louis Armstrong Stadium.
  Victoria Mboko of Canada, the 18-year-old who triumphed in Montreal this
  month, beating Naomi Osaka in the final, is up against Barbora Krejcikova,
  Wimbledon champion last year. Mboko won’t be fazed by another slam winner.
  Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to the second day of singles action at Flushing
  Meadows – hopefully Daniil Medvedev’s calmed down by now. Venus Williams, 45
  years young, will be up on Arthur Ashe in the evening but before then we’ve
  got plenty of names to keep an eye on: Madison Keys, Jack Draper, Petra
  Kvitova and Cam Norrie are in action over the next few hours. Drop me a line
  with your thoughts, queries and anything I’ve missed – there’s only so many
  screens I can use. Let’s get going.

He wins the first point against the Draper serve and it’s 5-5 … Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 6-6 Draper Draper seals his service game to -15 and it’s a tie-break to settle this third set. Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 6-5 *Draper (*denotes next server) At 30-15 Gomez winds up another shattering forehand, arrowing it left to right across the court, but it fades just wide in the tramlines. “When you’re hitting it that hard, it doesn’t need to be on the line,” observes Henman in the commentary box. Still, Gomez rounds off the game quickly enough, and it’s 6-5. Draper must serve to stay in the set. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 5-5 Draper (*denotes next server) And now Draper must serve to stay in the set. He does so, as efficiently as possible, unless you count the one point one by Gomez. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 4-4 Draper (*denotes next server) Draper has drawn level, meanwhile the commentators just said he was ‘unwell on the court’ while the TV director had switched to the Keys upset, code for vomiting I think. The Mexican Renata Zarazúa has knocked out the Australian Open champion and Illinois-born home hope! A huge upset in the first round of the women’s singles. 7-6 (10), 6-7 (3), 5-7 Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 4-3 *Draper (*denotes next server) Draper wins the first point again but is then worn down by a splendid display of hitting from his opponent, rounding off an attritional point with a lusty smash that bounces high into the stand. Gomez’s power comes to the fore again and at 30-30 Draper returns long to give a game point to his opponent. Then, Draper’s opponent completely mishits a double-handed backhand, and then fluffs a forehand into the net on the next point. Game point Draper and the chance of a break back … Gomez thrashes a couple of forehands to the corner, Draper gets them back, then the Argentinian floats an attempted drop shot into the net! Draper breaks back and he’s right back in the set. Gomez threw that away from 40-30, or was it more a case of impressive defence by Draper? *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 4-2 Draper (*denotes next server) Hold to love for Draper. We’ll see some more fireworks from Gomez up next, mark my words. Madison Keys, the No 6 seed, is in a spot of trouble against Renata Zarazúa, ranked No 82. It’s 5-5 in the final set on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 4-1 *Draper (*denotes next server) Gomez is going for broke here. He’s leaning into these forehands like a man possessed. He’s serving well too, and despite a very neat first point from Draper, sealed with a delicate drop-volley after a meaty hit to the back of the court, the Argentinian seals the game to -30. The final point is impressive too, hammering big forehands to either corner, then producing a sumptuous drop volley of his own to take the game. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 3-1 Draper (*denotes next server) “Draper will be looking to steady the ship right now,” says Henman on commentary. You can’t beat a bit of ship-steadying, and Draper eases to 40-0, then digs out a stunning half volley from the baseline to clinch the game which Gomez chases after but can’t get. Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 3-0 *Draper (*denotes next server) Henman suggests Draper’s “arm is not 100 per cent”. Gomez, meanwhile, closes out the hold of serve in double-quick time and he’s flown out of the blocks to a 3-0 lead in the third set. *Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 2-0 Draper (*denotes next server) At 30-0 Gomez winds up a huge forehand winner. He has an animated chat with his team, then produces another, arrowing a massively powerful forehand down the line that Draper has zero chance of getting anywhere close to. Quickly it’s 30-40 and then Gomez, standing waaaay behind the baseline, winds up several more massive forehands and forces an error, and that’s a break against Draper. Gomez roars with delight. That was an impressive game of “Well why not just go for it?” tennis. Gomez 4-6, 5-7, 1-0 *Draper (*denotes next server) Draper forces 30-30, and then deuce, with an excellent cross-court winner on the run. But the Argentinian extinguishes any hope of a break for the Briton with one big serve, for his advantage, and then Draper hits a forehand just wide from the back of the court. That’s the game. Thanks Taha, hello everyone, what an unexpected pleasure. I’m going to nab a break. Luke McLaughlin will keep you company for the next hour. A forehand down the line moves Draper to set point … and an ace completes the job. After a brief wobble, he finds himself up 6-4, 7-5. Questions will be asked about that left arm injury and whether it was responsible for those double-faults. Draper is geeing himself up as he takes the first two points off Gómez’s serve, and the southpaw has two break points. He gets stuck with his footing and nets a forehand … but Gómez finds the net cord and Draper regains his break advantage. He’ll serve for the set again with a 6-5 lead. Draper has lost a bit of flow as he serves for the second set. A double-fault – his fourth of the set – is followed by a volley into the net, and Gómez has two break points … he takes the first and roars! We’re 5-5 in the second. Ooooh, Gómez has a chance to break after three Draper double-faults … but the former goes long. Deuce. Gómez launches a cracking forehand return to get himself another break point … but Draper escapes with an ace on his second serve. Gómez fumes with himself after a misplaced forehand, and Draper holds. A brief opening disappears. Draper leads 6-4. 5-3. Keys has been forced into another tie-break … she’s 5-2 down against Zarazúa. A forehand volley makes it 5-3, but Keys double-faults: Zarazúa has three set points. She needs just one, sweeping a backhand to pull of a brilliant turnaround – she was 3-0 down in the set. It’s 7-6, 6-7, with Keys having accrued 66 unforced errors. Gómez saves two break points to get to deuce … but a double fault comes at a terrible time. The 28-year-old fights on, though, a backhand winner allowing him to hold. Draper leads 6-4, 3-2. Draper has got himself a break in the second set and he continues to deny Gómez any openings on his serve. The British No 1 leads 6-4, 3-1 and has little cause for concern. There’s been a proper turnaround in the Keys-Zarazúa contest. Zarazúa, who was 3-0 down, leads 5-4 and is serving for the second set. A double fault is a poor start, and she nets a volley moments later, prompting her to switch her racket. It doesn’t change much as Keys gets three break points. She fails to convert the first two but a whopping forehand makes it third time lucky. Keys leads 7-6, 5-5. Draper has his serve swinging viciously to set up two set points. He needs just one, Gómez going a bit too heavy with a backhand slice. Draper takes the first set 6-4, a welcome return to the court. Draper has gone up a break against Gómez and advances to a 5-4 lead. The Argentinian is a 28-year-old qualifier who made it to the second round at Roland Garros this year, his finest showing at a slam. Madison Keys seems to have found her rhythm after a mixed bag of a first set. She’s up 3-1 in the second against Renata Zarazúa … but here comes Zarazúa with two break points. She capitalises with the second opportunity; Keys had plenty of time to place a backhand but went long. Keys now leads 7-6, 3-2. Jack Draper launches two aces to make it 2-2 against Gómez. The fifth seed is playing his first singles match since Wimbledon, having battled with a left arm injury. “It’s not something which I’m going to go out on Monday and feel like it’s holding me back at all,” he said the other day. Gómez sends down a couple of blistering aces himself to lead 3-2. Cam Norrie claims the second set and Sebastian Korda shakes hands, the American having received treatment on his back earlier. Korda buries his head in his towel. Poor guy. Norrie was up 7-5, 6-4. Jack Draper’s tournament has begun. He’s in action against Federico Agustín Gómez on Louis Armstrong. Keys, meanwhile, has claimed that first set with a 12-10 tiebreak. She’s not been at her best but she’s on the board. Keys double-faults for the fifth time in the set, taking us to 3-3 in the tiebreak. She’s racked up more than 30 unforced errors and they continue to pile up, Keys’ forehand losing its radar as Zarazúa goes up 6-4. Keys saves the two set points and then another as they get to 9-9 … no one wants to win this set. Let’s get to Madison Keys, the sixth seed, who is serving to stay in the set: Renata Zarazúa leads 6-5 … and the underdog has two set points. Keys saves the first with a laser backhand, and a powerful forehand takes the game to deuce. Keys finds an ace at the perfect moment, and another down the middle to set up a tie-break. Krejcikova has her first match point but goes wide with a forehand. A double fault gives Krejcikova another chance but Mboko battles on. It takes a third match point for Krejcikova to convert, sending the promising 18-year-old home. Krejcikova has won nine of her 11 points at the net and she thunders a volley on her way to another game. She now leads 6-3, 5-2, with Mboko – tipped as one to watch this tournament – on her way out. Her heavily bandaged right wrist is getting some attention from the commentary team on Sky. Things get worse for Korda: he’s now getting some treatment on the court, his lower back getting rubbed. Victoria Mboko is up against it on Louis Armstrong against Barbora Krejcikova. The latter leads 4-1 in the second set. Cam Norrie is in control against Sebastian Korda, 2-0 up in the second set after taking the first. Korda’s troubles continue in the third game: when up to the net, he gets it all wrong with a straightforward smash. The American’s serve-and-volley isn’t bringing him all that much joy, but he does manage to hold. Norrie leads 7-5, 2-1. Madison Keys is up and running against Renata Zarazua on Arthur Ashe. Keys broke early but Zarazua has launched back; the latter leads 3-2 in the first set, with Keys serving. It’s all over for Petra Kvitova. Diane Parry triumphs 6-1, 6-0 inside an hour and that brings an end to the career of the former world No 2. A two-time Wimbledon champion, French Open runner-up and an Olympic bronze in there too. Elsewhere, Cam Norrie has taken the first set 7-5 against Sebastian Korda. Cam Norrie has three chances to break against Sebastian Korda … and he needs just one. Korda, up to the net, goes wide with a forehand and Norrie will serve for the first set: he’s up 6-5. Barbora Krejcikova has taken the first set against Victoria Mboko 6-3. The first point of the second set should be Mboko’s … but she overhits a volley. Korda goes long – just – with a forehand and Norrie has break point. But Korda matches Norrie’s trick in the previous game, launching an ace to get out of trouble. A passing forehand, from way behind the baseline, puts a smile on Norrie’s face: he’s got another break point. And it’s another ace from Korda! That’s his 10th of the match. Norrie gets his third chance to break with a backhand down the line but Korda’s serve is a serious force. The American battles on to take a 5-4 lead in the first set. Korda has a break point against Norrie … but out comes an ace down the middle. Norrie’s then up to the net, a delightfully delicate volley bringing him the advantage. He escapes danger and we’re 4-4 in this rather even fight. Victoria Mboko has a chance to break against Barbora Krejcikova, but a backhand slice finds the net. Mboko goes long with a forehand to give her opponent a 4-2 lead in the first set. Diane Parry has won the first set 6-1 against Petra Kvitova. Here’s a great interview Kvitova – two-time Wimbledon champion – did before the tournament. Yep, there’s that big serve. Korda sends down two more aces to go 3-2 up against Norrie in the first set. Norrie holds to go 2-2 but he’s got a proper challenge against Korda’s serve, the 25-year-old American reeling off aces – he’s ticked off six inside the opening 20 minutes. Cam Norrie is 1-1 with Sebastian Korda, the latter on serve. Norrie takes him to deuce, but Korda responds with an ace … and then a double fault. Deuce once again. Korda advances inside the baseline to sweep a backhand winner but Norrie’s passing forehand brings deuce again. Korda holds his nerve after four deuces and leads 2-1 in the first set. Mboko, the 22nd seed, has a nervy start and is broken in the first game by Krejcikova. Petra Kvitova, who will retire from tennis after this tournament, is a break down against Diane Parry of France. The future is here at Louis Armstrong Stadium. Victoria Mboko of Canada, the 18-year-old who triumphed in Montreal this month, beating Naomi Osaka in the final, is up against Barbora Krejcikova, Wimbledon champion last year. Mboko won’t be fazed by another slam winner. Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to the second day of singles action at Flushing Meadows – hopefully Daniil Medvedev’s calmed down by now. Venus Williams, 45 years young, will be up on Arthur Ashe in the evening but before then we’ve got plenty of names to keep an eye on: Madison Keys, Jack Draper, Petra Kvitova and Cam Norrie are in action over the next few hours. Drop me a line with your thoughts, queries and anything I’ve missed – there’s only so many screens I can use. Let’s get going.
