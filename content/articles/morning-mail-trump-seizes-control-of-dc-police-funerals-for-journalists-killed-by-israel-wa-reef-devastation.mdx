  Good morning. As the funerals of five Al Jazeera journalists are held in Gaza
  City, global outrage is mounting over Israel’s targeted killings – including
  of prominent reporter Anas al-Sharif. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has seized
  control of Washington DC police and deployed the national guard in the US
  capital, erroneously claiming it to be one of the most crime-ridden cities in
  the world. Closer to home, coral bleaching has devastated a vast area of
  Western Australia’s reef systems following a record marine heatwave. And we
  look at the journey towards Indigenous inclusion at the University of
  Melbourne. Australia Coral bleaching | The “longest, largest and most intense”
  marine heatwave ever recorded in Western Australia has killed coral throughout
  an area that stretches 1,500km, according to scientists. Clouds on the horizon
  | Sydney’s had its soggiest start to August in nearly three decades, and even
  more rain could be on the way this spring. Abnormally high sea surface
  temperatures off the NSW coast are partly to blame. Lesson to be learned? | An
  online database of lesson plans would help teachers cut hours from their
  workloads and help reverse years of stagnating student results, the
  Productivity Commission says. Erin Patterson | A judge ruled the triple
  murderer would have been unfairly prejudiced if a jury heard allegations she
  had tried to kill her estranged husband in the years before the poison
  mushroom meal. ‘Political fig leaf’ | The government’s announcement it will
  recognise a Palestinian state is meaningless if it continues trade and
  diplomatic relations with Israel, the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network
  says. Our chief political correspondent writes that recognising Palestine is a
  landmark moment for the PM and explains how it came about. World
  Russia-Ukraine war | Donald Trump has confirmed that he and Vladimir Putin
  will discuss “land swapping” when they meet this week in Alaska for a
  high-stakes summit on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Gaza crisis | “If these
  words reach you … Israel has succeeded in killing me”: these are the last
  worlds of Al-Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif, one of five journalists killed
  by a targeted Israeli airstrike in Gaza. Many of Gaza’s media workers have
  “risked everything” for their work. Seizing DC | Donald Trump has deployed the
  national guard in Washington DC, claiming the US capital is “overtaken by
  violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals … and homeless people”. Meanwhile, he
  has once again delayed implementing sweeping trade tariffs on China,
  announcing another 90-day pause hours before a previous agreement expired.
  With love, Meghan | The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a fresh
  multi-year film and television deal with Netflix, contradicting reports this
  year that the streaming company would not renew its contract with them. Dog
  controls | India’s supreme court has ordered the immediate removal of
  thousands of stray dogs from the Delhi capital region, citing canine attacks
  and an alarming rabies toll. Full Story Australia’s plan to recognise
  Palestine The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has confirmed his government
  will join other allies to formally recognise Palestinian statehood. Our chief
  political correspondent Tom McIlroy speaks with Full Story host Nour Haydar
  about why the Australian government is making this move now – and whether it
  will change anything for the Palestinians living under attack in Gaza.
