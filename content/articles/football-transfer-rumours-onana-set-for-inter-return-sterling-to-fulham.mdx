  First up, a transfer that might not actually happen. Federico Chiesa,
  Liverpool’s saviour on Friday evening, wants to stay and fight for his place.
  And perhaps hear the song that the Kop has devised for him for a bit longer.
  As the summer window closes, attention is turned to those players who want to
  go, need to go. Chelsea’s squad is full of them, and they are looking for
  takers for players they don’t need. Two leading the list are Raheem Sterling
  and Christopher Nkunku, among eight bomb-squad members the Blues want to bomb
  out. Bayern Munich want to loan Nkunku, but Chelsea want him gone permanently.
  Fulham want to add Sterling in what seems rather like the Willian role, with
  Marco Silva doing his usual renovation job. Nicolas Jackson, Axel Disasi,
  Renato Veiga, Carney Chukwuemeka, Ben Chilwell, Tyrique George and Aarón
  Anselmino are among those being readied for loan or sale. Aston Villa have
  been linked with Jackson. Talking of players who might need to go … André
  Onana, who was dropped by Manchester United on Sunday for Altay Bayindir, with
  Tom Heaton on the bench. Where to, though? Well, it seems Inter may be
  interested in having him back, having been the star of their losing effort in
  the 2023 Champions League final. A Liverpool deal that might happen is Marc
  Guéhi … but perhaps not yet. The same goes for Tottenham’s move for Eberechi
  Eze. Crystal Palace are reported to want to retain both players to help guide
  the club into the group stage of the Conference League. They host Fredrikstad
  on Thursday. Tottenham also want to make that Eze signing a structured deal,
  of £55m plus add-ons. Rennes defender Jérémy Jacquet is seen as a possible
  replacement for Guéhi. Newcastle latest: no move for Yoane Wissa will be
  happening, say Brentford. Not, at least, until Brentford sign a replacement.
  That sounds familiar where Newcastle are concerned, as they seek possible
  options to fill the Alexander Isak hole looking like being left. Borussia
  Dortmund want to loan Claudio Echeverri from Manchester City for the season.
  Who? He’s the Argentinian youngster who came on in last season’s FA Cup final
  while Jack Grealish sat on the bench. City will also loan new arrival Sverre
  Nypan to Middlesbrough. Another exit: West Ham are ready to let midfielder
  Edson Álvarez go to Fenerbahce, on a loan with a view to a permanent deal,
  including loan fee.
