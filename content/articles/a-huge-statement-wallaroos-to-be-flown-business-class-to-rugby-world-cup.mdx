  The Wallaroos are ready for business. Australia’s 32-player squad have booked
  their tickets to the Women’s Rugby World Cup in England where they will not
  only aim to advance from a challenging group but also intend to prove their
  “worth” after gradual improvements in the backing they receive. The players
  will jet off to England next week seated in business class for the first time
  as a team, two years after players lashed out at RA for inequities between the
  women’s and men’s national programs and called out differences in how the
  players were sent on long-haul flights. World Rugby has funded the upgrade for
  the Wallaroos and New Zealand’s Black Ferns in what is seen as recognition for
  the growing professionalism in the game, but also to help level the playing
  field once players arrive. “It’s a huge statement from Rugby Australia and
  World Rugby to invest in us, and I think the Kiwi girls, to fly business class
  because of the length of the trip,” Wallaroos veteran Emily Chancellor said.
  “I hope it’s going to have a really positive impact on the players’ feeling of
  worth, but also on performance. “To be able to lie down and stretch your legs
  a little bit more for that 24-hour flight, rather than being stuck at the back
  of the plane, is a huge step forward for us. “We’ve been reminded that it’s
  not a new standard, it’s not something that we will see for every tour, but
  it’s nice to see that World Rugby have acknowledged the length of travel that
  we’re going to have to go through to get over to the World Cup.” Olympic
  sevens gold medallist Charlotte Caslick has been included in the squad
  announced by coach Jo Yapp on Monday after winning a race against time to
  recover from a syndesmosis injury, while captain Siokapesi Palu also returns
  to bolster the Wallaroos. The squad includes 15 World Cup debutants but just
  as much has changed for the Wallaroos off the field since they were knocked
  out of the last tournament by England in the quarter-finals, including Yapp
  being brought in 18 months ago as the team’s first full-time coach. Australia
  will open their tournament against world No 15 Samoa in Salford on 23 August
  before a crunch clash with the USA on 31 August. A showdown with top-ranked
  England will complete the pool matches on 7 September. The Wallaroos have
  never beaten the Red Roses, but with only the top two teams in each group
  progressing to the knockout stage, Chancellor is confident the world No 8 team
  can hit the ground running and avoid a do-or-die meeting with the hosts. “We
  obviously have a tough pool, but in my mind, there’s no question about us
  getting out [of the pool],” Chancellor said. “Success is not getting out of
  the pool, success is doing one better than what we did at the last World Cup
  when we were stoked to make the quarter-finals. “If we don’t do better than
  that this time, we will be disappointed in ourselves. I’m expecting that we
  will go one better and make the semis.” The Wallaroos rediscovered their form
  with a rain-soaked victory over Wales in Sydney last Friday that helped wash
  away concerns over a shock defeat to the tourists a week before. Chancellor
  captained the national side for the first time in the pair of internationals
  against Wales with Palu sidelined by a foot injury, and could be called on to
  lead the Wallaroos at the World Cup. Yapp has not named Australia’s skipper
  for the tournament with uncertainty over whether Palu – and Caslick – will
  prove their fitness in time to line up in the opener against Samoa. Australia
  squad: Katalina Amosa, Bree-Anna Browne, Charlotte Caslick, Emily Chancellor,
