  The mathematics of famine are simple in Gaza. Palestinians cannot leave, war
  has ended farming and Israel has banned fishing, so practically every calorie
  its population eats must be brought in from outside. Israel knows how much
  food is needed. It has been calibrating hunger in Gaza for decades, initially
  calculating shipments to exert pressure while avoiding starvation. “The idea
  is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” a
  senior adviser to the then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said in 2006. An
  Israeli court ordered the release of documents showing the details of those
  macabre sums two years later. Cogat, the Israeli agency that still controls
  aid shipments to Gaza, calculated then that Palestinians needed an average
  minimum 2,279 calories per person per day, which could be provided through
  1.836kg of food. Today, humanitarian organisations are asking for an even
  smaller minimum ration: 62,000 metric tonnes of dry and canned food to meet
  basic needs for 2.1 million people each month, or around 1kg of food per
  person per day. As Gaza has slid into famine this summer, Israeli officials
  have variously denied the existence of mass starvation, claimed without
  evidence that Hamas steals and hoards aid, or blamed hunger on UN distribution
  failures, sharing pictures of aid pallets awaiting collection inside the
  border. They pointed to deadly and chaotic food distributions by the Gaza
  Humanitarian Foundation, a US and Israeli-backed logistics startup, as proof
  that Palestinians had access to food. Yet data compiled and published by
  Israel’s own government makes clear that it has been starving Gaza. Between
  March and June, Israel allowed just 56,000 tonnes of food to enter the
  territory, Cogat records show, less than a quarter of Gaza’s minimum needs for
  that period. Even if every bag of UN flour had been collected and handed out,
  and the GHF had developed safe systems for equitable distribution, starvation
  was inevitable. Palestinians did not have enough to eat. A “worst-case
  scenario” famine is now unfolding in Gaza, UN-backed food security experts
  said this week. Food deliveries are “at a scale far below what is needed”,
  amid “drastic restrictions on the entry of supplies”, the Integrated Food
  Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in a report citing Israeli figures on
  aid. The Famine Review Committee, an independent group of experts that
  scrutinises IPC alerts, said food shipments “have been highly inadequate”, and
  singled out the GHF. “Our analysis of the food packages supplied by the GHF
  shows that their distribution plan would lead to mass starvation, even if it
  was able to function without the appalling levels of violence that have been
  reported,” the FRC said. In March and April Gaza was under total siege, with
  no food entering. In mid-May Netanyahu said shipments would restart because of
  international pressure over a “starvation crisis”. Just a few weeks of extra
  aid shipments during the ceasefire in January and February this year provided
  enough calories to bring Gaza back from the brink of famine, UN data shows.
  However, in May only a trickle of food returned, in quantities that served
  only to slow Gaza’s descent into starvation, not stop it. Two months on, the
  scale of suffering has now spurred another round of international outrage,
  including demands from Donald Trump to get “every ounce of food” to starving
  children. In response Netanyahu has promised only “minimal” extra aid. The
  number of food trucks entering the territory has risen, but is still well
  below the minimum needed to feed Palestinians there, much less reverse a
  famine. Airdrops, used intermittently throughout the war, have also restarted,
  with France, Germany, the UK, Egypt, Jordan and the UAE among the countries
  announcing flights even though parachuting in food is expensive, inefficient
  and occasionally deadly. Last year at least 12 people drowned trying to
  recover food that landed in the sea, and at least five were killed when
  pallets fell on them. In the first 21 months of war, 104 days of airdrops
  supplied the equivalent of just four days of food for Gaza, Israeli data
  shows, for a cost running to tens of millions of dollars. Spent on trucks, the
  same budget would deliver much more food, but the price of these flights is
  not only a monetary one. They allow Israel and its allies to frame starvation
  as a catastrophe caused by logistics, not a crisis created by state policy.
  Airdrops would usually be ordered as a last resort to feed people in emergency
  situations where hostile armed forces or geography make road deliveries
  impossible. In Gaza the only obstacles to driving aid across the border are
  restrictions imposed by Israel, an ally of many western nations including
  Britain, and armed with British and US weapons. Two Israeli-based rights
  groups this week declared that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, with
  reports citing evidence including the weaponisation of hunger. B’tselem
  described an “official and openly declared policy” of mass starvation.
  Israel’s government knows how much food Gaza’s people need to survive, and how
  much food goes into the territory, and in the past used that data to calculate
  how much food was needed to avoid starvation. The vast gap between the
  calories Gaza needs, and the food that has entered since March makes clear
  that Israeli officials are doing different maths today. They cannot pass
  responsibility for this human-made famine to anyone else, and nor can their
  allies. • This article was amended on 1 August 2025. It was 104 days of
  airdrops, not 104 individual flights, that provided the equivalent of just
  four days of food for Gaza in the first 21 months of the war, Israeli data
  shows.
