  Environmentalists have called for the abolition of the Forestry Corporation of
  New South Wales after the state-owned agency was charged with 29 offences
  alleging it repeatedly failed to protect a threatened species. The state
  Environment Protection Authority laid the charges on Thursday after a two-year
  investigation into accusations the corporation breached forestry and
  biodiversity laws while operating in the Tallaganda state forest, east of
  Canberra. An EPA spokesperson said it was alleged that between August 2021 and
  January 2024 the corporation conducted forestry operations in seven areas
  without properly identifying and protecting habitat for the endangered
  southern greater glider. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The alleged offences
  were laid under coastal integrated logging rules, the Forestry Act and the
  Biodiversity Conservation Act. They include failing to properly search for and
  identify glider den trees before harvesting, failing to replace hollow-bearing
  trees that were damaged or felled and damaging the habitat of a threatened
  species. Three environment organisations – WWF Australia, Wilderness
  Australia, and South East Forest Rescue – have campaigned to close the
  corporation and revealed images of destruction in the forest in 2023. They
  said the new charges against the agency should be the “final straw”. Scott
  Daines, from South East Forest Rescue, said NSW should follow Western
  Australia and Victoria in stopping native forest logging. “Eastern Australia
  remains a global deforestation front and much of that is driven by logging in
  NSW,” he said. “How much longer can the NSW government persist with destroying
  our irreplaceable forests?” Andrew Wong, operations manager for Wilderness
  Australia, accused the Forestry Corporation of being a “rogue agency”. “This
  agency is built on a business model of pushing boundaries to survive and yet
  it still racks up millions in losses,” he said. “Shutting down native forest
  logging and transitioning to plantations will be hugely beneficial.” Dr Kita
  Ashman, a conservation scientist with WWF Australia, said forests were “far
  more valuable standing – for wildlife, carbon storage and future generations”.
  A Forestry Corporation spokesperson said it had been informed of the legal
  proceedings “in relation to operations in Tallaganda state forest in 2023”.
  They declined to comment further while the matter was before the state’s land
  and environment court. The agency was ordered to immediately stop logging in
  parts of the forest in August 2023 after a dead greater glider nearby. At the
  time, conservationists warned the area was one of the last known strongholds
  of the southern greater glider. The corporation has been convicted for
  environmental offences more than a dozen times. Earlier this year, a former
  magistrate, Prof David Heilpern, and one of Australia’s most experienced
  scientists, the Australian National University’s David Lindenmayer, accused
  the corporation of being effectively a “criminal organisation” after a string
  of prior court convictions. The agency described the criticism – which
  included Heilpern comparing the agency to a bikie gang – as “ridiculous”. The
  NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the agency was a
  “serial offender”. “The Forestry Corporation is costing the public millions of
  dollars every year in losses and yet blame community scrutiny and legal action
  for their failed business model,” she said. “The Minns Labor government cannot
  claim to be serious about biodiversity or climate while allowing this industry
  to continue.” The NSW government declined to comment while the issue was
  before the courts. The case is listed for an initial hearing on 10 October.
