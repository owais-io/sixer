  A special unit in Israel’s military was tasked with identifying reporters it
  could smear as undercover Hamas fighters, to target them and to blunt
  international outrage over the killing of media workers, an
  Israeli-Palestinian investigation has found. The “legitimisation cell” was set
  up after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, the Israeli-Palestinian +972
  Magazine and Hebrew-language Local Call reported. The unit’s objective was to
  gather information that could bolster Israel’s image and shore up diplomatic
  and military support from key allies, the report said, citing three
  intelligence sources. According to the report, in at least one case the unit
  misrepresented information in order to falsely describe a journalist as a
  militant, a designation that in Gaza is in effect a death sentence. The label
  was reversed before the man was attacked, one of the sources said. Earlier
  this week, Israel killed the Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and three
  colleagues in their makeshift newsroom, after claiming Sharif was a Hamas
  commander. The killings focused global attention on the extreme dangers faced
  by Palestinian journalists in Gaza and Israel’s efforts to manipulate media
  coverage of the war. Foreign reporters have been barred from entering Gaza
  apart from a few brief and tightly controlled trips with the Israeli military,
  who impose restrictions including a ban on speaking to Palestinians.
  Palestinian journalists reporting from the ground are the most at risk in the
  world, with more than 180 killed by Israeli attacks in less than two years,
  according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel carried out 26
  targeted killings of journalists in that period, the CPJ said, describing them
  as murders. Israel has produced an unconvincing dossier of unverified evidence
  on Sharif’s purported Hamas links, and failed to address how he would have
  juggled a military command role with regular broadcast duties in one of the
  most heavily surveilled places on Earth. Israel did not attempt to justify
  killing his three colleagues. Before the attack, press freedom groups and
  Sharif himself had warned that Israeli accusations of Hamas links, first made
  in 2024, were designed to “manufacture consent to kill”. They had been revived
  and repeated with increasing frequency after his reporting on famine in Gaza
  went viral. Intelligence sources told +972 magazine that the “legitimisation
  cell” worked to undermine the work done by Palestinian journalists as well as
  their protected status under international law. Officers were eager to find a
  media worker they could link to Hamas, because they were convinced Gaza-based
  journalists were “smearing [Israel’s] name in front of the world”, a source
  was quoted saying. In at least one case, they misrepresented evidence to
  falsely claim a reporter was an undercover militant, two sources said,
  although the designation was reversed before an attack was ordered. “They were
  eager to label him as a target, as a terrorist, to say it’s OK to attack him,”
  one recalled. “They said: during the day he’s a journalist, at night he’s a
  platoon commander. Everyone was excited. But there was a chain of errors and
  corner-cutting.” “In the end, they realised he really was a journalist,” the
  source added, and the reporter was taken off the target list. Israel’s
  government often gave the army orders about where the unit should focus their
  work, and the primary motive of the “legitimisation cell” was public
  relations, not national security, the sources said. When media criticism of
  Israel over a particular issue intensified the cell would be tasked with
  finding intelligence that could be declassified and used to counter the
  narrative, the magazine reported. “If the global media is talking about Israel
  killing innocent journalists, then immediately there’s a push to find one
  journalist who might not be so innocent, as if that somehow makes killing the
  other 20 acceptable,” the article quoted an intelligence source saying. The
  cell also reportedly sought information on Hamas’s use of schools and
  hospitals for military purposes, and failed attacks by Palestinian armed
  groups that harmed civilians there. Some in the unit were reportedly concerned
  about publishing classified material for public relations reasons rather than
  military or security objectives. Officers were told their work was crucial to
  Israel’s ability to keep fighting, one source said. “The idea was to (allow
  the military to) operate without pressure, so countries like America wouldn’t
  stop supplying weapons,” a second source said. “Anything that could bolster
  Israel’s international legitimacy to keep fighting.” The IDF has been
  approached for comment. On Friday, at least 16 Palestinians were killed by
  Israeli attacks in Gaza, including five who were trying to get food aid,
  medical sources told Al Jazeera. Israel also issued evacuation orders for
  northern parts of Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood, as it intensified
  military operations before a planned escalation of the ground war in Gaza,
  which has been widely criticised domestically and abroad.
