  In my years of reviewing beauty tech, it was upgrading my hair dryer that made
  the biggest difference to my beauty routine. I used to dread hair-wash days:
  the chore of shampooing, conditioning and rinsing my hair, plus the time – and
  aching arms – spent getting it dry again. My clunky, bargain-bucket hair dryer
  of seven years was weighty, deafeningly loud, and took a painstaking 20
  minutes to dry my hair completely. So happier days really did arrive when I
  switched it up for a new model. My current hair dryer uses a lightweight
  digital motor that’s not only far quieter, but is also powerful enough to dry
  my hair in just five minutes. It seems modern hair dryers have stepped up
  their game. Here, you’ll find the best hair dryers I’ve ever tested, from
  gentle options with diffusers for curly hair to ultra-fast models that shave
  significant time off your morning routine. You’ll also find expert hair-drying
  guidance from celebrity hairstylist Melissa Timperley. *** At a glance Best

  Nanoe Moisture+ £229 at Panasonic Best lightweight hair dryer: Head Jog
  Futaria £118.80 at Cosmetify *** Why you should trust me I’ve been reviewing
  beauty products for four years and have amassed a near-encyclopaedic knowledge
  of hair care. I’ve attended countless styling masterclasses, interviewed hair
  stylists, and completed a cosmetic science course where I learned exactly how
  hair growth, styling and care work at a cellular level. I’ve tested and
  reviewed more than 57 hair-styling tools – including hair dryers, curlers, hot
  brushes, wavers and straighteners – from big-name brands and newcomers alike.
  And perhaps most impressively, I’ve walked away with my hair healthy and
  intact. How I tested Having researched the most popular brands and models, I
  put 18 hair dryers through their paces for this test. I also spoke to a hair
  stylist to find out what she looks for in a hair dryer, then cherrypicked the
  best 10 from my tests to include here. I used an anemometer to test each
  model’s maximum wind speed, which ranged from a measly 16 metres a second
  (m/s) to a mind-boggling 48m/s, and also a sound meter to measure noise levels
  from 15cm away. Claims of “enhanced shine or smoothness” aren’t quantifiable,
  but I did use every hair dryer to complete the same task, noting how long it
  took to rough-dry hair and then to finish. I also tried my hand at using a
  round brush to achieve a smooth, bouncy blowout. While I’m no professional at
  this, it did allow me to make a judgment about how easy a hair dryer’s
  controls are to use, how precise and versatile its settings are, and comfort
  levels over the course of styling. When testing was complete, I returned the
  samples to the manufacturers who sent them. If samples could not be returned,
  they were sent to the Redbridge Reach Out domestic abuse service, who provide
  support and refuge for survivors. *** The best hair dryers in 2025 *** Best
  hair dryer overall: Hershesons the Great £225 at Hershesons Testing the
  Hershesons the Great hair dryer confirmed my belief that there’s no need to
  reinvent the wheel. This hair dryer perfects the basics and irons out any
  common niggles. It’s the lightest option I’ve ever tested, almost the quickest
  – and an easy recommendation. Why we love it The Great hair dryer has four
  speeds, three heat settings and a cool shot. It reached a super-fast 38.4m/s
  in my tests, rough-drying my hair in less than five minutes, and leaving it
  soft and healthy-looking. You change the settings using buttons on the hair
  dryer’s handle, which can then be locked into place. This is unlike button
  controls on other models, which can be accidentally pressed mid-use. One
  distinctive feature of the Hershesons hair dryer, and something that goes a
  long way to justify its premium price, is its heat-proof mat. This will
  automatically switch off the dryer when it’s placed on to it, resuming again
  once it’s lifted. I found this invaluable when blow-drying my hair with a
  round brush, since I could plonk the hair dryer down to section my hair
  without having to faff around with the controls. Add on two concentrator
  nozzles, a diffuser, a fabric bag and a sturdier storage case, and the Great
  is a hair dryer that truly feels designed with the user in mind. It’s a shame
  that … it’s so expensive. Next to hair dryers with magnetic attachments, the
  push-on system here also felt archaic and made it more difficult to switch out
  tools. Weight (without wire): 294g Cord length: 2.75m Heat settings (including
  cool shot): four Speed settings: four Attachments: concentrator nozzles and a
  diffuser Maximum wind speed: 38.4m/s Volume range: 82-86dB *** Best budget
  hair dryer: BaByliss Hydro-Fusion £60 at Look Fantastic £58.28 at Amazon If
  you ever struggle with frizzy hair after blow-drying, chances are you need an
  ionic dryer. This budget-friendly BaByliss option has a good range of speed
  and heat settings, a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser, making it suitable
  for numerous hair types. Furthermore, thanks to its 2,100W motor, its 26.4m/s
  maximum wind speed rivals some of the pricier options on this page. Why we
  love it It was immediately clear that the Hydro-Fusion was well built and
  powerful. It rough-dried my hair in about 10 minutes, leaving it feeling
  healthy and totally free from frizz and flyaways. Despite this power, it’s
  quieter than many of the models here, too. Attachments securely clicked into
  place and stayed on without issue while I completed my round-brush blow-dry
  test. I found the hair dryer’s two speed settings offered plenty of control
  for more precise styling, and the cool shot came through quickly compared with
  other cheaper hair dryers I’ve tested. Once styled, my hair was bouncy and
  shiny, with a frizz-free finish that lasted multiple days. It’s a shame that …
  its design is pretty basic; there are no frills here. A few more colour
  options would have been welcome, too, but you’re unlikely to find a better
  hair dryer for the price. Weight (without wire): 430g Cord length: 2.5m Heat
  settings (including cool shot): four Speed settings: two Attachments:
  concentrator nozzle and a diffuser Maximum wind speed: 26.4m/s Volume range:
  78-85dB *** Best hair dryer for curly hair: Panasonic Nanoe Moisture+ £229 at
  Panasonic £229 at Currys As counterintuitive as it sounds, this hair dryer
  adds moisture to your hair. Panasonic’s Nanoe technology creates microscopic
  water droplets that penetrate the hair’s cuticle to add extra moisture to the
  hair’s deepest layers. It claims this helps to reduce colour fading, flyaways,
  split ends and breakage. Why we love it I tested the Panasonic EH NA0J hair
  dryer after several hair washes and found its distinctive shape intuitive to
  use. For rough-drying, I used heat and the fastest speed setting (23.4m/s),
  and was impressed at how quickly the hair dryer worked its magic (in about 10
  minutes). Compared with the other models here, the Nanoe appeared to separate
  wet clumps of hair into smaller sections, drying strands faster. Despite using
  the one and only heat setting, my hair felt smooth and healthy after a rough
  dry. And when attempting the round-brush blow-dry, the Nanoe set the style
  quickly using its cool shot. This hair dryer is particularly good at gently
  diffusing curly and coily hair types. The diffuser attachment locks securely
  on to the front of the body, and its long prongs are well designed to spread
  air gently from the root to the tip of a curl. Add in its moisturising
  capabilities, and you’ll be left with soft, shiny, healthier curls with each
  use. It’s a shame that … it has only one heat setting. Instead, the Nanoe
  offers multiple modes: alternating hot and cold for preserving shine; a scalp
  care mode and a skin care mode. These won’t be right for every user,
  particularly if you like adjusting the heat levels manually. But if your hair
  needs extra nourishment, this hair dryer is worth a shot. Weight (without
  wire): 460g Cord length: 2.7m Heat settings (including cool shot): one (plus
  scalp care and alternating modes) Speed settings: three Attachments:
  concentrator nozzle and a diffuser Maximum wind speed: 23.4m/s Volume range:
  73-84dB *** Best lightweight hair dryer: Head Jog Futaria £118.80 at Cosmetify
  £139.94 at Amazon This is the fastest hair dryer I’ve ever tested, and
  weighing in at 304g, the Futaria is just 10g heavier than the lightest option
  – the Hershesons above. It was the dark horse here; I hadn’t encountered Head
  Jog before my most recent round of testing, but with its super-fast wind
  speeds of 43.8m/s and reasonable price point, it’s an easy favourite. Why we
  love it The Futaria hair dryer packs a serious punch, rough-drying my hair in
  a blisteringly quick four minutes. Thanks to its three speed and four heat
  settings, I could master a precise round-brush blow-dry without much effort at
  all. Personally, I found the wider concentrator nozzle best for styling larger
  sections of hair, which sped up the process even further. The digital motor
  also makes the Futaria relatively quiet, and despite its light weight, the
  design feels sturdy and evenly weighted, plus its rear filter is easy to clean
  and maintain. As such, this model is perfect for use in busy salons to reduce
  wrist strain and maximise time efficiency. And those of us at home will also
  benefit from the dryer’s sleek design, which is available in blue, pink and
  black. It’s a shame that … since it’s tailored to professional stylists, it’s
  not as widely stocked as other hair dryers. Also, those concerned about damage
  may find the knock-your-socks-off power a little much. That said, if you’re
  careful with the highest intensity settings, and use a heat protection spray,
  you shouldn’t fry your hair. Weight (without wire): 304g Cord length: 3m Heat
  settings (including cool shot): four Speed settings: three Attachments: two
  concentrator nozzles and a diffuser Maximum wind speed: 43.8m/s Volume range:
  78-84dB *** The best of the rest *** Parlux 3200 Plus £117.19 at Sally Beauty
  £119.95 at Amazon Best for: fuss-free styling Italian brand Parlux is well
  known for making high-quality, powerful, long-lasting hair dryers. According
  to the brand, the Parlux 3200 Plus (previously Compact) is the most widely
  used professional hair dryer on the market. I found it well balanced and
  comfortable in the hand and liked its tactile, retro-feeling switches. During
  testing, it dried my hair incredibly quickly, leaving a glossy, frizz-free
  finish. That’s thanks to the inclusion of Parlux’s K-lamination motor, which
  provides the power of a 2,800W motor while using only 1,900W. The hair dryer
  is available in a wide range of colours, and is a stylish option – if you can
  look past the box, which looks freshly fished from the early 2000s. It didn’t
  make the final cut because … it’s heavier than other options here, plus it
  lacks the design refinements of more expensive models. Weight (without wire):
  588g; cord length: 3m; heat settings (including cool shot): three; speed
  settings: two; attachments: two concentrator nozzles; maximum wind speed:
  26m/s; volume range: 80-85dB *** Cloud Nine the Airshot Pro £299 at Look
  Fantastic £199 at Amazon Best for: quiet operation Taking both the highest and
  lowest noise levels into account, the Airshot Pro is the quietest hair dryer
  I’ve tested. In addition, my hair was left with gorgeous shine thanks to the
  Sericite-infused heat tech that features in Cloud Nine’s heat-styling tools.
  As well as offering a great range of temperature controls, with a continuous
  cool shot option, the Airshot’s magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser
  attachments proved secure and suited to a range of hair types. It didn’t make
  the final cut because … it lacks a dedicated cool shot button, and it’s not as
  speedy as others in this price range. Still, some may be swayed by its quiet
  operation. Weight (without wire): 448g; cord length: 3m; heat settings
  (including cool shot): four; speed settings: three; attachments: two
  concentrator nozzles, diffuser; maximum wind speed: 23.8m/s; volume range:
  75-79dB Bellissima B-travel £40 at AO £49.99 at Boots The dinky Belissima
  B-travel hair dryer is a brilliant option for trips and holidays. It has
  dual-voltage controls, so you can use it wherever you are in the world. Its
  folding handle and carry case keep everything safe in transit, and it feels
  very sturdy considering its price. Unlike most hotel hair dryers, which only
  let out a pathetic trickle of air, this hair dryer provides wind speeds of up
  to 18.9m/s – faster than some full-size options I’ve reviewed and highly
  impressive given the hair dryer’s light weight. You also get a concentrator
  nozzle for precision styling and two speed options. It didn’t make the final
  cut because … there’s one control switch, so you can’t adjust the heat setting
  independently from the speed settings, and the difference between the two heat
  settings is negligible. Its travel-based use case is limited; for the same
  price, you’d be better off investing in an alternative with multiple
  temperature settings to use at home. Weight (without wire): 305g; cord length:
  1.8m; heat settings (including cool shot): two; speed settings: two;
  attachments: concentrator nozzle; maximum wind speed: 18.9m/s; volume range:
  79-84dB *** Gtech DryOnic £179 at AO £179 at Currys Best for: precise
  temperature controls One of my biggest bugbears with hair dryers is that you
  never quite know how much heat you’re using on your hair. Thankfully, the
  Gtech DryOnic has a screen on the back that displays the airflow setting and
  its temperature. With temperatures that range from 40-100C, you can make
  precise adjustments for your hair type. I found the various airflow settings
  useful and liked how securely the magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser
  attachments fitted on to the dryer. After styling, my hair felt soft and
  hydrated, with minimal frizz. It didn’t make the the final cut because … it’s
  not quite as quick as others here at a similar price, and its 2m cord isn’t
  quite long enough for my liking. I also found it too easy to accidentally
  press the buttons and change the temperature midway through styling. Weight
  (without wire): 426g; cord length: 2m; heat settings (including cool shot):
  five; speed settings: four; attachments: concentrator nozzle and diffuser;
  maximum wind speed: 18.8m/s; volume range: 78-85dB *** Remington Shine Therapy
  £19 at AO £18.98 at Amazon Best for: tight budgets This lesser-known hair
  dryer is the sister product to the popular Remington Shine Therapy hair
  straighteners. It offers equally brilliant value and is designed to add shine
  to the hair using ionic technology. While difficult to quantify in tests, I
  found the hair dryer did dry my hair relatively quickly and left it shiny and
  smooth after a round-brush blow-dry. Multiple heat and speed settings, plus a
  concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachment, make it a good option for all
  hair types. It didn’t make the cut because … of its short 1.8m cord and the
  fact it’s pretty noisy compared with other models here. That said, it can’t be
  beaten on price and is a sensible choice if you’re hoping to upgrade an old
  hair dryer on a budget. Weight (without wire): 449g; cord length: 1.8m;
  heat/cool settings: four; speed settings: two; attachments: concentrator
  nozzle and diffuser; maximum wind speed: 18.6m/s; volume range: 84-89dB ***
  What you need to know *** I interviewed Melissa Timperley, hair stylist and
  founder of Melissa Salons, to discover her tips for choosing a hair dryer.
  “When it comes to protecting your hair and achieving the style you want, the
  tool you use matters just as much as the products you pair it with,” she says.
  What features should I look for? According to Timperley, the key features are
  adjustable speed and heat settings, which “allow for better control and
  protection, depending on your hair type and styling needs”. Look for hair
  dryers with a cool shot button, too, which “help to seal the cuticle and set
  your style”. Design-wise, consider weight, which is “especially important for
  longer hair or professional use” to prevent arm strain. Also look for a dryer
  that has a removable or self-cleaning filter, as “this makes cleaning and
  maintenance easy, which helps preserve motor life”. What to avoid when
  choosing a dryer Timperley warns that there are some features, or omissions,
  that could be detrimental to hair health. It’s best to avoid “single-setting
  dryers that don’t allow heat or speed control”, as well as low-wattage dryers
  under 1,800W, because “they often take longer to dry hair, exposing it to heat
  for too long”. However, some of the dryers I’ve chosen here are below 1,800W.
  That’s because these use digital motors, which are smaller and lighter than
  brushed motors and produce faster airflow. That means, in those cases, the
  difference in drying speeds is negligible. She also warns against buying
  “heavy, bulky dryers that are uncomfortable to use regularly” and
  “poor-quality nozzles or diffusers that don’t fit securely or distribute air
  properly”. Put simply, she says: “If the dryer doesn’t clearly list its motor
  type, wattage or heat settings, that’s a red flag.” What makes a hair dryer
  good for different hair types? Picking out the right hair dryer for your hair
  type can be challenging. “The best hair dryers cater to your hair’s specific
  needs – whether that’s smoothing frizz, protecting fine strands or cutting
  through thick, coarse textures,” says Timperley. For fine or damaged hair,
  Timperley advises looking for “lower heat settings and a ceramic or tourmaline
  dryer that distributes heat more gently”. For thick or coarse hair, “higher
  wattage and powerful airflow are essential – infrared, ionic and titanium
  dryers are great for cutting drying time without excessive heat”. And finally,
  for curly or textured hair, “a diffuser attachment is key, as is a dryer that
  offers heat control without sacrificing volume or natural texture”. What’s the
  difference between ionic and ceramic hair dryers? “Ionic hair dryers emit
  negative ions that help break down water molecules faster, reducing drying
  time and frizz,” says Timperley. “They’re great for smoothing and shine,
  especially if you have thick, frizzy or unruly hair.” Conversely, “ceramic
  hair dryers use ceramic heating elements to distribute heat evenly, which
  helps prevent hotspots and damage. They’re ideal for fine or delicate hair”.
  “Some of the best hair dryers,” says Timperley, “combine both technologies,
  giving you faster drying without sacrificing hair health.” *** Sarah Matthews

Weight (without wire): 588g; cord length: 3m; heat settings (including cool shot): three; speed settings: two; attachments: two concentrator nozzles; maximum wind speed: 26m/s; volume range: 80-85dB *** Cloud Nine the Airshot Pro £299 at Look Fantastic £199 at Amazon Best for: quiet operation Taking both the highest and lowest noise levels into account, the Airshot Pro is the quietest hair dryer I’ve tested. In addition, my hair was left with gorgeous shine thanks to the Sericite-infused heat tech that features in Cloud Nine’s heat-styling tools. As well as offering a great range of temperature controls, with a continuous cool shot option, the Airshot’s magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachments proved secure and suited to a range of hair types. It didn’t make the final cut because … it lacks a dedicated cool shot button, and it’s not as speedy as others in this price range. Still, some may be swayed by its quiet operation. Weight (without wire): 448g; cord length: 3m; heat settings (including cool shot): four; speed settings: three; attachments: two concentrator nozzles, diffuser; maximum wind speed: 23.8m/s; volume range: 75-79dB Bellissima B-travel £40 at AO £49.99 at Boots The dinky Belissima B-travel hair dryer is a brilliant option for trips and holidays. It has dual-voltage controls, so you can use it wherever you are in the world. Its folding handle and carry case keep everything safe in transit, and it feels very sturdy considering its price. Unlike most hotel hair dryers, which only let out a pathetic trickle of air, this hair dryer provides wind speeds of up to 18.9m/s – faster than some full-size options I’ve reviewed and highly impressive given the hair dryer’s light weight. You also get a concentrator nozzle for precision styling and two speed options. It didn’t make the final cut because … there’s one control switch, so you can’t adjust the heat setting independently from the speed settings, and the difference between the two heat settings is negligible. Its travel-based use case is limited; for the same price, you’d be better off investing in an alternative with multiple temperature settings to use at home. Weight (without wire): 305g; cord length: 1.8m; heat settings (including cool shot): two; speed settings: two; attachments: concentrator nozzle; maximum wind speed: 18.9m/s; volume range: 79-84dB *** Gtech DryOnic £179 at AO £179 at Currys Best for: precise temperature controls One of my biggest bugbears with hair dryers is that you never quite know how much heat you’re using on your hair. Thankfully, the Gtech DryOnic has a screen on the back that displays the airflow setting and its temperature. With temperatures that range from 40-100C, you can make precise adjustments for your hair type. I found the various airflow settings useful and liked how securely the magnetic concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachments fitted on to the dryer. After styling, my hair felt soft and hydrated, with minimal frizz. It didn’t make the the final cut because … it’s not quite as quick as others here at a similar price, and its 2m cord isn’t quite long enough for my liking. I also found it too easy to accidentally press the buttons and change the temperature midway through styling. Weight (without wire): 426g; cord length: 2m; heat settings (including cool shot): five; speed settings: four; attachments: concentrator nozzle and diffuser; maximum wind speed: 18.8m/s; volume range: 78-85dB *** Remington Shine Therapy £19 at AO £18.98 at Amazon Best for: tight budgets This lesser-known hair dryer is the sister product to the popular Remington Shine Therapy hair straighteners. It offers equally brilliant value and is designed to add shine to the hair using ionic technology. While difficult to quantify in tests, I found the hair dryer did dry my hair relatively quickly and left it shiny and smooth after a round-brush blow-dry. Multiple heat and speed settings, plus a concentrator nozzle and diffuser attachment, make it a good option for all hair types. It didn’t make the cut because … of its short 1.8m cord and the fact it’s pretty noisy compared with other models here. That said, it can’t be beaten on price and is a sensible choice if you’re hoping to upgrade an old hair dryer on a budget. Weight (without wire): 449g; cord length: 1.8m; heat/cool settings: four; speed settings: two; attachments: concentrator nozzle and diffuser; maximum wind speed: 18.6m/s; volume range: 84-89dB *** What you need to know *** I interviewed Melissa Timperley, hair stylist and founder of Melissa Salons, to discover her tips for choosing a hair dryer. “When it comes to protecting your hair and achieving the style you want, the tool you use matters just as much as the products you pair it with,” she says. What features should I look for? According to Timperley, the key features are adjustable speed and heat settings, which “allow for better control and protection, depending on your hair type and styling needs”. Look for hair dryers with a cool shot button, too, which “help to seal the cuticle and set your style”. Design-wise, consider weight, which is “especially important for longer hair or professional use” to prevent arm strain. Also look for a dryer that has a removable or self-cleaning filter, as “this makes cleaning and maintenance easy, which helps preserve motor life”. What to avoid when choosing a dryer Timperley warns that there are some features, or omissions, that could be detrimental to hair health. It’s best to avoid “single-setting dryers that don’t allow heat or speed control”, as well as low-wattage dryers under 1,800W, because “they often take longer to dry hair, exposing it to heat for too long”. However, some of the dryers I’ve chosen here are below 1,800W. That’s because these use digital motors, which are smaller and lighter than brushed motors and produce faster airflow. That means, in those cases, the difference in drying speeds is negligible. She also warns against buying “heavy, bulky dryers that are uncomfortable to use regularly” and “poor-quality nozzles or diffusers that don’t fit securely or distribute air properly”. Put simply, she says: “If the dryer doesn’t clearly list its motor type, wattage or heat settings, that’s a red flag.” What makes a hair dryer good for different hair types? Picking out the right hair dryer for your hair type can be challenging. “The best hair dryers cater to your hair’s specific needs – whether that’s smoothing frizz, protecting fine strands or cutting through thick, coarse textures,” says Timperley. For fine or damaged hair, Timperley advises looking for “lower heat settings and a ceramic or tourmaline dryer that distributes heat more gently”. For thick or coarse hair, “higher wattage and powerful airflow are essential – infrared, ionic and titanium dryers are great for cutting drying time without excessive heat”. And finally, for curly or textured hair, “a diffuser attachment is key, as is a dryer that offers heat control without sacrificing volume or natural texture”. What’s the difference between ionic and ceramic hair dryers? “Ionic hair dryers emit negative ions that help break down water molecules faster, reducing drying time and frizz,” says Timperley. “They’re great for smoothing and shine, especially if you have thick, frizzy or unruly hair.” Conversely, “ceramic hair dryers use ceramic heating elements to distribute heat evenly, which helps prevent hotspots and damage. They’re ideal for fine or delicate hair”. “Some of the best hair dryers,” says Timperley, “combine both technologies, giving you faster drying without sacrificing hair health.” *** Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.
