  THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD Considering Cymru head coach Craig Bellamy is so
  patriotic that he lives in a house constructed entirely of Fragrant Spring
  daffodil bulbs, thinks the long-running BBC soap opera Pobol y Cwm is a
  documentary and has Dafydd Iwan’s stirring anthem Yma o Hyd as his ringtone,
  it was no surprise he was impressed by the journey undertaken by Wales fan
  John McAllister to get to his nation’s World Cup qualifier in Kazakhstan.
  Currently sitting second in Group J, a point behind North Macedonia but with
  Belgium three points further back with two games in hand, Wednesday
  afternoon’s match in Astana is a fairly must-win one for Wales. Anything less
  than three points would prove a crushing disappointment for McAllister, who
  set off for the Kazakh capital from Barry five weeks ago and has taken in 11
  football matches, no end of foreign boozers, a heavy metal gig and some Irish
  stranger’s stag do as he travelled around 5,000 kilometres east across four
  time zones and 12 countries on a series of 17 trains, 11 buses and one plane
  (a flight he’d rather have not taken but was unable to avoid). “We’ve got to
  see him, because it means so much to us,” said Bellamy of McAllister’s bonkers
  odyssey. “I’m beyond proud of that fact.” While super-fan McAllister may kick
  himself when he discovers he could have just taken a direct flight from
  Cardiff to Astana like the Wales team, he is likely to receive a hero’s
  welcome from around 1,000 fellow supporters who took a far less circuitous and
  comparatively unadventurous route to Astana. “To see how they all get on with
  each other as well,” said Bellamy, beaming with pride at the devotion of his
  bucket hat-wearing brethren. “They look after each other, they’re well behaved
  but they enjoy themselves. We want to be like that, we want to play like
  that.” While Celtic’s Bigger Cup exit at the hands of Kairat Almaty last week
  proved that teams from far-flung European outposts don’t always have it their
  own way when they visit Astana, the current incarnation of Wales should
  realistically expect to beat a team 83 places below them in the Fifa rankings
  and one who they have already seen off in Cardiff. For the first time in 15
  years, the Welsh team is also likely to be boosted by the rare inclusion of
  representation from Hollywood FC. “I think we’re all captivated by the journey
  of Wrexham,” trilled Bellamy of the plucky rag-tag assortment of churchmice
  and underdogs from the Racecourse Ground who spent over £30m on 13 players in
  the recent transfer window. “It’s been amazing for Welsh football and
  hopefully now in a number of years we’ll see young players coming through.
  Surely, whether it’s Swansea, Newport, Cardiff, Wrexham, the better they do
  the better chance we have of being a stronger nation in football.” While Danny
  Ward and Nathan Broadhead will miss out against Kazakhstan with knack, along
  with Leeds defender Joe Rodon, the in-form Wrexham striker Kieffer Moore is
  likely to feature and it is to be hoped the 6ft 5in target man was afforded
  plenty of leg-room on the eight-hour flight over. QUOTE OF THE DAY I am
  definitely used to playing in hot temperatures now in Italy” – recalled
  England midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek reckons he can handle the heat – which
  is handy given Thomas Tuchel’s side may have to play in dangerously scorching
  conditions at the Geopolitics World Cup next year. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS I
  only read Big Website of course (ahem) but I did chance upon this piece in
  yesterday’s Estadios de España on Atlético Madrid’s B team and their new
  stadium. Yes, it’s international fortnight and I’m bored already. Apparently,
  in 1999, they finished second in the Segunda División but obviously couldn’t
  be promoted to La Liga as Atlético Madrid were already there. And, to make
  things worse, just a year later, Atlético Madrid were relegated to the Segunda
  División in 2000 so the B team were forced to go down into the third tier!” –
  Noble Francis. The photo of Arsenal players celebrating their 1971 FA Cup win

  info missing was, who is that dude in the background giving off Saturday Night
  Fever vibes? We deserve to know” – Jim Scullion. I can’t tell you how relieved
  I am to finally see the back of the transfer window. My brain was so saturated
  with rumours, cliches and transfer jargon that I lost the ability to
  distinguish between a deal sheet and a sh!t deal. I simply couldn’t deal with
  this sheet anymore” – Peter Oh. If you have any, please send letters to
  the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is

  Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson,
