  Brazil’s foreign ministry has summoned the US chargé d’affaires after the
  embassy posted comments about the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, as
  relations between the two countries continue to deteriorate. On Thursday, the
  embassy published a social media post in Portuguese criticising the supreme
  court justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the cases against
  Bolsonaro, who is on trial over an alleged coup attempt. The post read:
  “Minister Moraes is the chief architect of the censorship and persecution of
  Bolsonaro and his supporters. His flagrant human rights violations have led to
  sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, imposed by President Trump. “Moraes’s
  allies in the judiciary and elsewhere are hereby warned not to support or
  facilitate his actions. We are monitoring the situation closely.” The message
  was a translated repost of a statement by Darren Beattie, the US’s senior
  official for public diplomacy. The Brazilian government viewed the message as
  a direct threat to the other supreme court justices presiding over Bolsonaro’s
  trials and – given that Trump has yet to appoint an ambassador to Brazil –
  summoned the acting head of mission, chargé d’affaires Gabriel Escobar. It was
  the third time Escobar had been summoned since Donald Trump began publicly
  defending Bolsonaro, even citing the former Brazilian president’s prosecution
  over the 2022 coup attempt as one of the justifications for the steep tariffs
  imposed on Brazilian goods. According to a source at the ministry, the interim
  secretary for Europe and North America, Flavio Goldman, expressed to Escobar
  the Brazilian government’s “deep indignation” over the tone and content of
  recent posts from the embassy and the US state department, which Brasília
  viewed as “interference in domestic affairs and unacceptable threats against
  Brazilian authorities”. The US embassy did not comment on the meeting. Before
  Friday’s summons, Escobar had attended a meeting on Thursday with Brazil’s
  vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, who has been leading the Lula
  administration’s thus far unsuccessful efforts to reverse the tariffs. Brazil
  says it has been seeking to open negotiations with the US since April, but has
  received no response. This week, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da
  Silva, told Reuters: “The day my intuition says Trump is ready to talk, I
  won’t hesitate to call him. But today my intuition says he doesn’t want to
  talk. And I won’t humiliate myself.”
