  It’s not about immigration – or rather, it’s not just about immigration. Pam
  Bondi, the US attorney general, sent letters this week to dozens of cities and
  counties around the country, warning them that their leaders could be
  prosecuted and federal funds stripped from their cities if they don’t
  “cooperate” with Donald Trump’s deportation scheme. The threats against cities
  come amid a backdrop of a crackdown on crime in Washington DC, where Trump,
  after similar actions in Los Angeles, has sent in the military against the
  wishes of local leaders. The attacks on cities will not stop with Washington.
  Using immigration as a pretext, the Trump administration wants to go after
  Democratic-run cities across the country to settle political scores, assert
  the president as a strongman and, potentially, arrest his opponents.
  “Individuals operating under the color of law, using their official position
  to obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts and facilitating or
  inducing illegal immigration may be subject to criminal charges,” Bondi wrote.
  Or, as Bondi told Fox News after the letters were sent, she is telling local
  leaders: “You better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal
  law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you.” In DC,
  the administration drew a lawsuit over its takeover of the city’s police
  force, after Bondi sought to end sanctuary policies that prevent local law
  enforcement from sharing information with immigration officials about people
  in custody. If the Trump administration moves forward with threats to charge
  local officials, it would be an escalation of Trump’s long-simmering war on
  cities. The president has sought to paint cities as liberal “hellholes” in
  need of liberation, delivered through military takeovers and arrests. On the
  campaign trail in 2024, Trump often went on diatribes against cities, calling
  out specific places that he wanted to target. In one speech from early 2024,
  he promised to “take over the horribly run capital of our nation” and said he
  would “rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety and beauty – better
  than they have ever been before”. He continued this tradition this week,
  naming majority Democratic cities run by Black mayors – Baltimore, Oakland,
  Los Angeles, Chicago – and putting them on notice that he could come there
  next. Bondi’s letter spells out what cities are facing financially if they
  defy the president: Trump has directed federal agencies to look at their
  statutory ability to tie “immigration-related terms and conditions” to “combat
  sanctuary policies” when they are doling out federal grants, contracts and
  funds. Trump’s allies who wrote Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for a
  second Trump administration, suggested using this tactic to force cities,
  counties and states to aid immigration enforcement. In his first
  administration, Trump tried to use a justice department grant program this
  way, but the plan was tied up in court for years. Cities are ready to fight
  back. They have been in court defending their rights to create local policies
  that prevent their police forces from carrying out Trump’s immigration agenda.
  Localities that received the letter have said it mischaracterizes their
  policies and ignores local control. Bruce Harrell, Seattle’s mayor, said his
  city will remain a “welcoming city for all” and will continue to defend itself
  in court if needed. And if Trump brings troops to their streets, they say they
  will be ready to push back. “We will be prepared to take any legal and any
  other action that we need to take,” said Brandon Scott, Baltimore’s mayor, in
  a press call on Thursday. “And I know that my brother and sister mayors around
  the country feel the same way.”
