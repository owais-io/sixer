  The last time yields on 30-year UK government bonds were this high, Rachel
  Reeves was a first-year student at Oxford, getting to grips with economics.
  The chancellor could be excused a moment of nostalgia for such innocent times
  after waking on Tuesday to a barrage of headlines about Keir Starmer taking
  back control of economic policy – and a fresh sell-off in the government bond,
  or gilt, markets. Alongside rising yields, meaning the government must pay
  more to service its debts, sterling was also declining on the foreign exchange
  markets, losing 1% against the dollar by mid-morning. This combination –
  rising yields and a declining currency – is often viewed as a warning signal
  of fragile investor confidence. The 10-year yields that the Office for Budget
  Responsibility (OBR) uses to forecast future borrowing costs were also on the
  rise, hitting the highest level since January, at 4.82%. Despite dark
  predictions about a 1970s-style budget crisis, market watchers were quick to
  point out that rising yields, particularly for longer-term government bonds,
  are not a UK-specific phenomenon. “There’s a lot of hysteria about UK
  borrowing costs, but if you look what happened to yields in the UK, it’s not
  much different to what’s happened in other markets,” said Neil Shearing, the
  group chief economist at consultancy Capital Economics. An auction of 10-year
  gilts by the Treasury’s debt management office on Tuesday – the way the
  government borrows from markets – was oversubscribed by 10 times. While that
  showed plenty of appetite for UK government debt, the yield was the highest
  since 2008. There are several reasons for the global drift upwards in
  longer-term yields, which include the acute budget crisis in France, stirrings
  of inflation in Japan, and above all, Donald Trump’s extraordinary attacks on
  the independence of the Federal Reserve. Economists generally see the
  independence of the Fed as strengthening its inflation-fighting credibility.
  It is unclear what will be the outcome of the legal battle between the Trump
  White House and Fed board member Lisa Cook, whom the president last week
  announced he was firing. But the scene appears set for acontinuing struggle to
  bring the institution under political control. In the short term, US interest
  rates appear to be on the way down, as Trump has long demanded, after the Fed
  chair, Jerome Powell, used a speech at the recent Jackson Hole meeting to
  signal a change of position, pointing to the weakening US labour market. But
  in the longer term, investors appear to be starting to fret about the
  credibility of US economic management, given Trump’s assault on a string of
  key institutions, and his plans to borrow trillions more. One way those doubts
  have been expressed is in a sell-off of long-dated Treasury bonds. Gold has
  shot up to a fresh record high too, in another potential sign of investor
  anxiety. But no matter the global nature of this latest bond market sell-off,
  it only adds to the intense pressures facing Reeves as she – and No 10’s new
  hires – prepare for the budget, now set to be in November at the earliest. A
  downgrade of the OBR’s expectations for future productivity, and therefore
  economic growth, together with the U-turns on winter fuel payments and planned
  benefits cuts, are expected to leave Reeves with a hole of perhaps £20bn or
  even £30bn to fill, if she wants to continue meeting her fiscal rules. News
  that No 10 plans to wade into pre-budget planning, after a flurry of
  speculative stories about tax rises, does not appear to have reassured
  investors. Any package of possible tax rises will have to satisfy No 10’s
  determination to avoid a winter fuel-style voter backlash, without sparking
  consternation in fretful bond markets. Few in the City or Westminster expect
  Reeves to rewrite her fiscal rules or tear up Labour’s pre-election pledges on
  taxing “working people”. She may well implement the International Monetary
  Fund’s recommendation of only having one binding OBR forecast a year, to avoid
  the six-monthly scramble to meet targets based on highly uncertain forecasts,
  five years ahead. That will save her some pain in the spring, but meanwhile
  she is expected to be casting around for significant extra revenue from
  somewhere, with markets watching closely. “It’s the classic ‘you wouldn’t
  start from here’,” says HSBC’s chief European economist, Simon Wells. “This is
  going to be a muddle-through, stick-to-the-rules kind of budget; that’s all
  she can really do.”
