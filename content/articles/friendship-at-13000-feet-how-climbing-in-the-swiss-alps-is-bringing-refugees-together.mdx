  At 4,000 metres, conditions can be challenging. The air is thin, movement
  takes effort, and the ice and snow demand proper gear: warm layers, crampons,
  an ice axe, ropes for crossing glaciers. Yet a group of refugees in
  Switzerland – from Afghanistan, Iran, Palestine, Ukraine and elsewhere – say
  this is exactly where they have found freedom, calm and even respite from the
  trauma of war, political persecution and imprisonment. “Mountaineering isn’t
  just a sport. Reaching the summit brings an incredible sense of relief. And
  it’s proof that you can overcome your physical and emotional challenges, even
  after extreme hardship,” says Soroush Esfandiary, 27, adding that the Alps
  remind him of growing up near Iran’s Zagros mountains, but also of his escape
  from home. Esfandiary arrived in Switzerland four years ago, initially
  crossing the mountains from Iran into Turkey on foot. “I had a high fever and
  was coughing up blood, but I kept moving. I was so afraid,” he says. After
  joining the mass protests in Iran in 2019, initially sparked by a sudden surge
  in fuel prices, Esfandiary was imprisoned and put in solitary confinement for
  two weeks in Isfahan intelligence prison. When he was released to await his
  trial, he knew he had to leave. Soon after reaching Switzerland, Esfandiary
  joined Peaks4All, a Geneva-based non-profit that supports refugee integration
  through mountaineering. “It’s more than mountaineering though,” he explains.
  “We’re a group of people from all over the world, connected by what we’ve been
  through. We are all here in Switzerland to find peace.” The idea of offering
  mountaineering to refugees in the Swiss Alps all started with two female
  mountaineers: “We came up with it because of our passion for Alpinism and
  social impact,” says Laëtitia Lam, who co-founded Peaks4All with her friend
  and fellow mountaineer Clémence Delloye. “What started as a one-off project
  with just a handful of people has grown into a community of more than 200
  refugees from across the globe, from Nigeria and Sudan, to Mongolia, Turkey
  and Syria. We also work with 40 volunteers and 30 mountain guides. I’m proud
  to say that we’ve also gone from having almost no women refugees in the group
  to over 40% today,” she says. Since 2022, Peaks4All has made one big climb a
  year: last year it was Ulrichshorn at 3,925 metres. Another summit is planned
  for this year. In between, the group regularly offers smaller hikes and other
  mountain activities such as bouldering and canyoning. Lam, whose father fled
  from Hong Kong to France for political reasons, says Peaks4All’s goal is to
  bridge the gap between refugees and Swiss communities. “We realised that many
  refugees live quite isolated lives and we wanted to open up new possibilities
  with the courses and training we offer,” she says. “At the same time, we saw
  that being together in nature had a big impact. The mountains became a place
  of peace and happiness for many.” Unlike Esfandiary, many at Peaks4All haven’t
  previously spent much time in the mountains. Diana Lysenko, 39, says: “I
  immediately said yes to training for and climbing a 4,000-metre [13,000ft]
  mountain, but I had no idea what to expect. The highest mountain in Ukraine is
  barely half the size of some of the Swiss peaks.” Lysenko arrived in Geneva in
  the summer of 2022, just months after the start of Russia’s full-scale
  invasion. “I realised the situation in Ukraine was only going to get worse,
  and I couldn’t handle living in constant fear any more, spending nights in
  bomb shelters and hoping that it wouldn’t be my building getting destroyed,”
  she says. Lysenko had previously lived in Kyiv and said many of her colleagues
  were killed when Russia invaded several towns surrounding the Ukrainian
  capital. “Integration was initially quite hard in Switzerland, that’s why
  Peaks4All was such a great opportunity. Climbing also helped me discover an
  inner strength I didn’t know I had,” she adds. The use of nature to support
  trauma recovery and mental wellbeing is gaining momentum and becoming a
  growing focus of research, including in the UK. Initiatives such as Dose of
  Nature for example, advocate for the mental health benefits of connecting with
  nature. Alem Big Qaderi, 26, an Afghan who arrived in Switzerland in 2023,
  says he felt “happy, safe, and hopeful for the future” when in nature.
  Climbing alongside people from around the world, he says, feels like being in
  a “global village.” After the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August
  2021, thousands fled the country. Qaderi had been studying in Turkey at the
  time, but knew there was no way to return home. In Europe, including in
  Switzerland, many refugees say they face challenges integrating, especially as
  politics in many countries have shifted further to the right. “At Peaks4All,
  we’ve created an amazing family. No matter where you are from and what
  language you speak,” Lam says. “For me, mountains have no nationality,” says
  Qaderi. “The Alps remind me of the mountains of my childhood. They feel like
  home.”
