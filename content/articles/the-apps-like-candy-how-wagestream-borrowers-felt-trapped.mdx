  When Andy, a server in Pizza Express, found himself in financial hot water
  before payday, getting a cheap advance on his wages was easy. Pizza Express,
  like hundreds of other employers with low-wage workers – including Asda, Next,
  Superdrug, Burger King and a number of NHS trusts – had struck a deal with the
  “financial wellbeing” app Wagestream, giving workers access to a suite of
  services including its key moneymaker: salary advance. For just £1.75 per
  withdrawal, Andy could take up to half of his wages early, with the agreement
  that he merely gave up the sum at payday. But the cheap, easy-to-use service
  meant he was soon falling behind. So when Wagestream launched “workplace
  loans” this year, a service that offered borrowers up to £25,000, he jumped at
  the chance to balance his finances, knowing he was unlikely to get approved
  for a loan elsewhere. But at 29.9% APR, the £1,000 loan he received was not
  exactly cheap. And as with its wage advance scheme, his repayments were
  automatically deducted from his pay; the lender’s returns were secured before
  Andy’s paycheck even hit his bank account, and before he had paid other
  essential bills. Andy is concerned about how easy it was to slip into debt,
  particularly through an app marketed through his employer as an “essential
  service”. “It is easy to fall into a negative pattern, streaming wages early,”
  Andy told the Guardian. “But imagine streaming wages and also loan payments.
  You could end up being a wage slave, having to work just to pay your debts
  back.” And he is not alone. A growing number of debt campaigners and unions
  are raising concerns about the rise of so-called workplace loans being offered
  by salary advance firms that have largely avoided public scrutiny. Wagestream
  was launched in 2018 by Portman Wills, now its chief technology officer, and
  Peter Briffet, its chief executive – who both retain a stake – bursting on to
  the scene with an aim of eradicating a payday lending sector that was
  teetering on the brink of collapse. That was the year that Wonga, the
  now-reviled payday lender that charged extortionate interest rates topping
  5,000%, fell into administration. It was a spectacular fall from grace, with
  Wonga once having been feted as a digital innovator and backed by the UK’s
  largest charity, the Wellcome Trust. Wonga’s demise and the backlash that
  followed left a gap in the market for more ethical lenders willing to serve
  low-wage earners. Wills and Briffett started building a financial app that
  they said would destroy the poverty premium, referring to a phenomenon where
  some of the poorest pay disproportionately higher fees for services and loans.
  They started with cheap wage advances – an unregulated product in the UK – but
  also offered budgeting tools, savings pots and financial coaching alongside
  its money-making proposition. They issued a social charter and branded
  Wagestream as a “financial wellbeing company”, helping to secure backing from
  high-profile charities including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Barrow
  Cadbury Trust through the Fair By Design investment fund, who were keen to see
  Wonga alternatives enter the market. The UK government-owned British Business
  Bank’s venture capital subsidiary, British Patient Capital, also invested in
  the lender, which clinched ethical B-Corp status in 2022. But Wagestream
  itself is not a charity and its investors, including the former Wonga investor
  Balderton Capital, will eventually expect to see returns. Other shareholders
  include the venture capital funds Northzone, QED, Smash Capital and BlackRock.
  Wagestream is still loss-making, having last reported a £22.2m pre-tax loss in
  2024, despite handing out 20.6m wage advances worth a total of £1.5bn. But
  loans could be the key to supercharging its earnings, having so far relied on
  fees – both from some employers and millions of staff accessing its wage
  advances. It said growing revenues in the upcoming year would outpace costs
  and start “moving the business towards profitability in future periods”. When
  asked whether Wagestream had always planned to branch into more lucrative
  interest-charging loans, Briffet told the Guardian: “Our vision is to provide
  pretty much all financial services that are feasible through the employer.”
  About 15,000 people have taken out one of Wagestream’s “workplace loans” so
  far, with most borrowing between £2,000 and £5,000, repaid over 24-36 months.
  While workers can take out only one loan at a time, this could change in
  future if the company deemed it to be “appropriate”, Emily Trant, Wagestream’s
  chief impact officer, told the Guardian. The wider rollout of loans is being
  funded through a £300m debt deal with the US bank Citi. It is not clear which
  of Wagestream’s clients are offering loans to their workers. But with few
  rivals in the UK, Wagestream workplace loans have an almost unique position,
  with its closest being a company called Salary Finance. By working through
  employers, Wagestream can directly market loans to workers already familiar
  with its streaming model. It can gain exclusive access to granular payroll
  data that can help it offer competitive interest rates. By automatically
  taking workers’ repayments directly out of wages, it is in an enviable
  position among lenders, in effect guaranteeing that debts are repaid. Direct
  debit payments are allowed but are not the default arrangement. The debt
  charity StepChange warned that lenders that deduct payments from wages needed
  to be alert to the riskthat borrowers could end up resorting to “additional
  borrowing, cutting back on essentials and missing bills”. Wagestream says
  representative APR on workplace loan is between 13.9% and 19.9%, meaning at
  least 51% of borrowers will get that rate. But the ultimate cap is negotiated
  with each employer, topping out at 34.9% APR. Wagestream insists that its
  model still saves borrowers an average of £593 per loan, with customers having
  been charged an average APR of 62% by former lenders before turning to the
  app. But the confluence of streaming and loans is causing concern, even among
  borrowers. Another Pizza Express worker told the Guardian that July was the
  first time in nine months that he had not accessed part of his pay early. “The
  temptation is there and once you start it is very hard to get out of the
  cycle,” he said. “I don’t have the willpower – and to stop yourself, it’s on
  you.” He was concerned about the availability of Wagestream’s loans,
  particularly as they have “quite high interest rates”. He added: “I try to
  stay away from it. It feels like it’s a trap. It’s too readily available and
  like eye candy. You open the app and there are a lot of bright colours.” A
  PizzaExpress spokesperson said staff had had access to Wagestream since
  November 2021, and it was part of a “range of tools our team members can use”.
  They added: “Participation is entirely voluntary and PizzaExpress does not pay
  for the platform nor receive any financial incentives for team members using
  any of the services.” Wagestream bosses said they did not consider how much or
  how often customers were taking wages early through its core service when
  assessing whether customers could afford its loans. “We don’t view streaming
  as credit. It’s a different way that somebody is managing their day-to-day
  payments,” Trant said. “So it really doesn’t factor into affordability.”
  Wagesteam later said in an emailed statement that salary advance habits were
  part of a wider assessment of loan applications, but it refused to provide any
  further information when the Guardian requested clarification. Part of the
  issue is that this type of loan, while regulated in the UK, is so new that
  there is little to no data on the long-term impact on vulnerable borrowers. In
  the meantime, debt and financial inclusion experts say wage advances or
  “streaming” should be viewed as loans. “These services should always be
  referred to as loans or credit as that’s exactly what they are. Using terms
  like ‘streaming’ or ‘salary advance’ can downplay the fact that people are
  borrowing money,” said Mick McAteer, a former FCA board member and a
  co-founder of the Financial Inclusion Centre research organisation. “Any form
  of credit could be called ‘salary advance’.” Wagestream’s website is peppered
  with claims that using its platform, which includes savings and budgeting
  tools, boosts retention and working hours. When asked if that was a result of
  people needing to work more to repay their debts or catch up on streaming,
  Wagestream disagreed and said it was in part a result of its real-time app
  showing how much workers earned per hour and boosting overall financial
  engagement with staff. Ascension, which manages the Fair by Design Fund
  through which the Joseph Rowntree Foundation became an early-stage investor,
  said it “recognised the concerns raised” about Wagestream’s loans but that its
  priority was finding “more affordable, responsible alternatives” to costly
  payday or doorstep lenders by “using stronger data and affordability checks
  than were available before”. It added: “This is not a substitute for fair
  wages or a robust welfare system, but it can help reduce reliance on the most
  harmful forms of credit.” A Joseph Rowntree Foundation spokesperson echoed
  those comments, saying the government needed to ramp up efforts to support
  families in financial hardship to help end dependence on unaffordable credit.
  “For now, the need for credit among those living in hardship continues.
  Against this backdrop, there is a role for responsible and impact-focused
  lenders to help families manage the cost of essentials during periods of
  hardship.” Wagestream said it applied “rigorous affordability and underwriting
  criteria to every loan issued. Our comprehensive lending assessment includes
  detailed information from payroll, open banking, credit bureaux, and usage of
  other Wagestream products. “Wagestream was founded on a social charter to
  improve workers’ financial wellbeing. By partnering with employers, we help
  people who are underserved by traditional financial institutions to earn,
  learn, save, spend and borrow on their own terms.” *Names have been changed
