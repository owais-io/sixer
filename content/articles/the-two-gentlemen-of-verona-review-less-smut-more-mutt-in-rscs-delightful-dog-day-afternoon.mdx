  The Two Gentlemen of Verona review – less smut, more mutt in RSC’s delightful
  dog day afternoon

  In the movie Shakespeare in Love, the theatre owner Philip Henslowe outlines
  the formula of his new star dramatist, including “mistaken identities … a bit
  with a dog, and love triumphant”. As the film is set in 1593, the reference by
  screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard is clearly to The Two Gentlemen of
  Verona in which romances overcome deceit and disguise and the clown Launce has
  a canine companion, Crab, who is prone to steal the show. During times of
  tight cultural budgets, such as now, there is an old theatre joke about the
  RSC being forced to put on One Gentlemen of Verona. Joanna Bowman’s revival
  doesn’t quite go that far but has radically cut the text (removing some but
  not all smut, the antisemitism and some sub-par poetry) for a running time
  advertised at 80 minutes but in performance 90. The aim is to attract younger
  audiences: the evening show time is a bedtime-friendly 5pm. Parents and
  teachers will perhaps advise their charges not to find templates for future
  relationships in the ruthless trickery between friends Valentine (Jonny Khan)
  and Proteus (Lance West) when both fall for Sylvia (Siân Stephens), prompting
  Proteus to fool cruelly current girlfriend Julia (Aisha Goodman). As Stephens
  is making a professional stage debut and the other three are also early in
  their careers, this confident and engaging quartet suggest the RSC has access
  to a flow of future talent. And, as ever, they do well to compete with the bit
  with the dog. Bowman and stage-handler Launce (a gamely upstaged Stu
  McLoughlin) completely fail to make Lossi, a silver haired lady lurcher, the
  “sourest-natured dog that lives” as Crab is called in the text. Lossi draws an
  instant “Aaaah!” from young and some older throats, especially when giving a
  presumably impromptu wide yawn during one of the longer speeches. Although
  some scholars make rigorous cases for the play being underrated, it seems
  reasonable to infer that Shakespeare was relying on Crab to divert the
  audience from sections that might have done with a refill of the quill. The
  director follows suit by adding other hectic distractions when the dog is not
  on. Actors slide down poles on Francis O’Connor’s two-tier scaffolded set and,
  in the multitalented cast of 10, only Lossi doesn’t play an instrument. The
  act four song, Who Is Sylvia?, usually a solo, becomes a full production
  number (composer John Patrick Elliott, music director Dan de Cruz) with
  guitars, violin and chorales. In Shakespeare in Love, the dramatist informs an
  appalled Henslowe that there will be “no dog at all” in Romeo and Juliet. But,
  if there were awards for onstage dogs (the Bonies?), Lossi would win one and
  the RSC should probably check out the possibility of walkies-on roles
  elsewhere in the canon. Until then, she and her human co-stars provide a late
  summer afternoon’s dream. • At The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 31
  August
