  Sharks without teeth might sound like the stuff of dreams to swimmers and
  surfers. Now a new study has found that ocean acidification could leave the
  apex predators without their critical survival weapon. Shark jaws carry
  several rows of teeth and new ones quickly push forward to replace losses.
  However, rapidly acidifying oceans are damaging shark teeth and could speed
  losses past replacement rates. Sharks with bad teeth could struggle to feed
  themselves efficiently, “potentially affecting shark populations and marine
  ecosystem stability”, the study said. Ocean acidification is caused by rapid
  carbon dioxide absorption creating a chain reaction that lowers pH levels.
  Projections suggest oceans could be far more acidic by the year 2300, falling
  from a current average pH of about 8.1 to 7.3, a change that will have
  “profound implications for marine organisms”, the study said. To test
  acidification effects, researchers kept 60 freshly fallen shark teeth in
  artificial seawater tanks, one matching the current ocean average pH of 8.1,
  another with the projected 7.3 pH. The teeth, safely collected from a German
  aquarium, had already been naturally discarded by six male and four female
  blacktip reef sharks. After eight weeks, teeth in the more acidic tank
  suffered about twice as much damage, said Maximilian Baum, the study’s lead
  author and a researcher working with Germany’s Heinrich Heine University’s
  Institute for Zoology and Organismic Interactions. Effects included “increased
  root corrosion … and altered serration”, he said. Dental stress would add to
  sharks’ other problems, which include prey shortages caused by overfishing.
  Reducing human-caused CO2 emissions is vital to mitigate ocean acidification.
  Previous research has found acidification damages denticles, a toothy scale on
  sharks’ skin. Even moderate drops could affect more sensitive shark species,
  such as those that use fewer rows of teeth or have slower replacement rates,
  said Baum. “I think there will be effects on the teeth of ocean predators in
  general when they are highly mineralised structures like we have in sharks,”
  he said. Previous studies have shown that acidification harms shells, corals
  and mussels, “and that was also the reason why we did this study, to show us
  the effects on larger predators”. More optimistically, Baum believes sharks
  may adapt by increasing tooth replacements and improving strengthening and
  repair. Lisa Whitenack, a professor at Pennsylvania’s Allegheny College who is
  a shark tooth expert and not part of the study team, said the new research
  added to initial findings on shark teeth and acidification. She too suggested
  tooth replacement may keep pace with acidification losses and added that
  corroded teeth may still be effective. “It will be interesting to see in
  future studies if the damage to teeth seen in studies like this one results in
  a functional effect on a tooth’s ability to do its job … [and if] damaged
  teeth can still cut or puncture prey.”
