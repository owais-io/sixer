  August is a tricky time to buy clothes. Shops are winding down their summer
  sales and introducing new season collections, but there’s still at least
  another month of good weather. Yet you don’t want to double down on summery
  separates too much, because autumn/winter is just around the corner. That’s
  why it’s the best time to start buying transitional pieces – those you can
  wear whether the temperature’s in the 30s or the low teens. Think about
  clothes that lend themselves to layering, such as an Oxford shirt. You could
  wear it over a tank top with trousers for a nice dinner fit on holiday, but it
  works just as well under a blazer when the weather changes. Similarly, a
  lightweight knit could be worn around your shoulders, over a T-shirt or even
  across your front a la Nicholas Hoult. Try to buy natural fibres where you
  can, too. Anything made using human-made textiles (polyester, nylon, rayon
  etc) tends to be less breathable, so it’s a one-way ticket to sweat patches.
  Stick to cotton, linen, merino wool or even cashmere, which regulate your
  temperature more effectively whether you’re too hot or too cold. Or, to save
  you some time and effort, here’s my top pick of the best pieces to see you
  through this season and beyond. You, and your future wardrobe, can thank me
  later. *** A striped Oxford shirt to wear year-round Arket relaxed poplin
  shirt £75 at Arket £63.75 at H&amp;M I wear striped Oxford shirts more than
  anything else in my wardrobe – and Scandi high-street retailer Arket always
  has a good selection. Dress them up with trousers or down with jeans; wear
  them with short shorts in summer; or with a blazer in winter – you can even
  wear them to work. You can make them appropriate for pretty much any
  situation. Stripes are trending for spring/summer 2026, too – just look at
  Dior, Saint Laurent, Wales Bonner and Emporio Armani – so even though it’s a
  timeless buy, it will also make you look like a menswear pro right now. *** A
  cap for all seasons Gant cotton twill cap £25.60 at Cho £40 at Gant Baseball
  caps have obvious benefits in summer, but they’re also useful when the sun’s
  not shining. They’re a stylish alternative to woollen hats, still delivering
  warmth and keeping the rain out of your eyes if you get caught in a shower.
  There’s loads to choose from, but I like six-panel constructions, which feel a
  little less structured than those with five. This Gant cap adds understated
  embroidery and a hidden pouch for the adjustable strap, which is a plus. ***
  The perfect versatile smart shoe GH Bass penny loafers £99 at Stuarts £160 at
  Farfetch Whenever you’re faced with a smart-casual dress code, you’ll want a
  pair of loafers to hand. No matter what time of year, they have the ability to
  make anything look elevated, whether you pair them with a T-shirt and jeans, a
  shirt and shorts, or a hoodie and work pants. My favourite silhouette is penny
  loafers – GH Bass is credited with popularising with this particular style
  (the Weejuns), which the brand first released in 1936. If you want something
  dressier, you could try horsebit loafers instead. *** A great pair of jeans
  Levi’s 501 jeans £80 at John Lewis £90 at Levi’s A strong pair of jeans is a
  great investment. You can wear them with anything bar formal wear, and they
  last for a really long time – so it’s one of the best categories to buy
  secondhand, too (check Beyond Retro, Rokit and Vinted). Levi’s always has an
  amazing selection to choose from, but you can’t beat the 501, the brand’s OG
  straight leg silhouette. It’s been popular for more than 150 years (since
  1873, to be exact), so chances are it’s not going out of style any time soon.
  *** The cashmere sweatshirt that’s not just for winter Rise &amp; Fall
  cashmere sweatshirt £220 at Rise &amp; Fall This might sound crazy, but a
  lightweight cashmere knit can be just as good in summer as winter. It’s
  lightweight. It’s comfy. And it helps regulate your temperature because it’s
  breathable. This Rise &amp; Fall sweatshirt lends itself to the transitional
  season with a loose, oversized fit, a relaxed dropped shoulder and a rolled
  hem that means it’s nice and airy. And if you get too warm, you can just throw
  it over your shoulders. *** The low-profile trainers Onitsuka Tiger Serrano
  £120 at Onitsuka Tiger Retro trainers have been a hot topic for a few years
  (did someone say Samba?). This year’s update is even lower profile, giving
  them a smaller sole and making them even more lightweight – so they’re a great
  swap for sandals as things start to cool down. If, like me, you’ve been
  feeling a little Adidas Samba fatigue, Onitsuka Tiger’s Mexico 66 are a great
  alternative. For more footwear ideas, check out our guide to the best trainers
  *** The boxy T-shirt Eme Studios navy oversized tee £50 at Eme Studios There’s
  nothing worse than having the same T-shirt as everyone else (unless it’s that
  Uniqlo Airism T-shirt, naturally), so it’s worth seeking out independent
  brands. Eme Studios has been trending recently, worn by everyone from Josh
  O’Connor to Jaden Smith and Evan Mock. This design has a boxy fit that’s just
  as perfect for showing off short shorts as classic work pants and jeans. ***
  The classic tracksuit bottoms Adicolor Classics Firebird tracksuit bottoms
  From £30 at Asos £38.50 at Adidas Most guys have a pair of sports shorts to
  wear around the house. If you’d like something similar that you could also
  wear for a flight or even to pop to the shops, tracksuit bottoms are the
  answer – and they’re having a moment, with sporty separates big on the
  spring/summer 2025 runways at Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Moschino. The best on
  the market? Adidas’s Firebird has a comfy straight leg and retro-inspired
  details. It comes in a rainbow of colours, so you’re covered regardless of
  your preference. *** Trousers for all weathers Uniqlo pleated wide trousers
  £39.90 at Uniqlo There are a few occasions when shorts just won’t do, even in
  the heat. But many trousers don’t lend themselves to hot climates. Enter
  Uniqlo’s pleated wide trousers. They’re lightweight. They’re loose. They’re
  flowy. And, because they’re tailored, they also look smart. And they’ll look
  great with a cosy jumper when winter comes. *** Classic wireframe sunglasses
  Jimmy Fairly the Ben sunglasses £135 at Jimmy Fairly Buying high-street
  sunglasses can be tricky towards the end of the season, but there are a few
  brands that offer quality designs at a great price. Jimmy Fairly is one of my
  favourites. Designs like these wire frames feel classic, so they’re a safe bet
  all year round – unlike statement colours and XL designs, which may feel
  particularly summer-coded. *** Swap citrus notes for woody accords &amp;Horace
  eau de parfum, 50ml £62 at Horace With fewer balmy nights on the horizon, you
  may want to change your lightweight spritz to one more woody or aromatic – but
  that doesn’t go as heavy as oud or leather. &amp;Horace has the perfect
  balance. Often compared to Le Labo’s Santal 33, it combines a base of
  sandalwood with bergamot, white pepper and tobacco for a fragrance that’s at
  once crisp and warm. *** Peter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist
