  The culture of the television and film industries needs to change to protect
  women from the actions of sexual predators, women who gave evidence against
  Noel Clarke in his failed libel action have said. “Noel’s behaviour was an
  open secret, everyone knew,” said Penelope, a pseudonym for an actor who
  filmed a sex scene with Clarke. “He didn’t work alone. Those who enabled and
  protected him should be accountable. “He found a way to operate as he did
  because there is a culture across these industries of actors not being
  protected while at work and having no way of whistleblowing,” she told the
  Guardian after the court dismissed Clarke’s case on Friday. Unless creative
  industries actively safeguarded women against sexual assault, harassment and
  abuse, “new Noel Clarkes will surface”, she said. “I hope that there will be a
  cultural shift to prevent further sexual predators finding a place in the UK
  TV, film and theatre industries.” Another woman, Helen Atherton, who testified
  about being repeatedly sexually harassed by Clarke at work, said:
  “Unfortunately I have had many conversations with female industry
  professionals since being involved in this case where they have shared their
  own experiences over the years of unwanted sexual attention, unprofessional,
  inappropriate or bullying behaviour from colleagues.” Male colleagues who
  witnessed inappropriate behaviour had told her “they felt really conflicted
  about speaking out, and most didn’t at the time due to the power of the
  individual involved and their status on the production they were working on”.
  Atherton said changes were under way in the film and TV industries to make
  them safer places to work. She said she hoped the revelations about Clarke
  would “encourage others who have been affected, or who are currently being
  affected, by similar experiences to speak out and not allow this behaviour to
  go unchallenged”. She said: “In my experience, this behaviour has become less
  common but I think there is still a way to go before this is true across the
  industry as a whole. The regulation and accountability of powerful individuals
  needs to improve.” Younger, less experienced workers in the industry should be
  encouraged to speak out “without the fear of causing trouble or receiving a
  tarnished reputation because you ‘made a fuss’”. She said there should be zero
  tolerance of inappropriate and unreasonable behaviour, no matter what the
  person’s “power status, pay grade, fame, or how integral they are to the
  project”. Lisa Graham, who endured inappropriate sexual remarks, touching and
  suggestions of sex from Clarke when she was a volunteer at a film event, said
  she was relieved the case was over but angry the actor was able to brand
  witnesses as liars in court. Under cross-examination by Clarke’s legal
  representatives, Graham was accused of exaggerating or embellishing her
  account. “But the reality is that the judge saw through him.” Penelope was
  told by Clarke that the pair needed to be naked from the waist down while
  filming a sex scene. He insisted she look at his erect penis, making her feel
  “panicked and shocked”, she told the court. After the court’s ruling, she
  said: “I have no joy in today’s verdict. It can never undo the awful behaviour
  of Noel Clarke against so many of us. I am simply relieved that at long last
  we have been heard, and that truth, in every sense, has won. “Facing a sexual
  predator takes strength that can’t be explained. It’s been a very hard few
  years accepting and dealing with the trauma of all of this. I only hope no
  other women will have to go through it.” Penelope, Atherton and Graham were
  among 26 witnesses who gave oral evidence regarding Clarke’s behaviour. Three
  more witnesses submitted statements to the court. Clarke alleged that “almost
  all of the Guardian’s 29 witnesses to the truth defence are lying, at least in
  part, in the evidence they have given to the court”. The claim was dismissed
  by the court.
