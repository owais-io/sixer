  Giles Richards’ report has landed, so that means this live blog will conclude.
  It’s been a pretty entertaining weekend in Zandvoort. A nightmare one for
  Lando Norris, Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc, of course, but a dream one
  for Oscar Piastri and Isack Hadjar. Max Verstappen will take second in front
  of his home supporters. As always, a massive thanks for reading and emailing
  in. Until next time! McLaren – 584 pts Ferrari – 260 Mercedes – 248 Red Bull –
  214 Williams – 80 Aston Martin – 62 Racing Bulls – 60 Sauber – 51 Haas – 44
  Alpine – 20 Piastri – 309 pts Norris – 275 Verstappen – 205 Russell – 184
  Leclerc – 151 Hamilton – 109 Antonelli – 64 Albon – 64 Hulkenberg – 37 Hadjar
  – 37 Stroll – 32 Alonso – 30 Ocon – 28 Gasly – 20 Lawson – 20 Bearman – 16
  Sainz – 16 Bortoleto – 14 Tsunoda – 12 We don’t share too much from Twitter X
  anymore, but these Hadjar scenes were special. Piastri speaks… “It’s a pretty
  hard act to follow Isack… but it feels good. I felt like I was in control of
  that one. Very happy with the work we’ve done and very satisfied to come out
  on top. This weekend was looking like a difficult one but managed to get it
  together in qualifying and kept it together today. It wasn’t just myself who
  improved [from last year] it was a big effort from the team.” Isack Hadjar is
  over the moon. “It feels a bit unreal,” he says. “What was surprising for me
  was keeping that fourth place throughout the race. The real was unreal the
  whole weekend and I maximised what I had, made no mistakes. [The podium] was
  always the target since I was a kid. Hopefully many more.” Verstappen chats
  after the race, he seems fairly happy. “It wasn’t easy, I gave it everything.
  Unfortunately we didn’t have the pace of the McLarens but we got a bit lucky
  with one retiring. Being second is a really good achievement for us.” Isack
  Hadjar is getting absolutely mobbed by the Racing Bulls backroom staff. He’s
  ecstatic with his podium finish – as well he might be! A great moment for a
  rookie driver. What an incredible drive. Piastri accepts the acclaim of the
  Dutch fans. It’s a very good weekend to be wearing orange, whether you’re a
  Dutch supporter of Max Verstappen or connected with McLaren – with the notable
  exception of Lando Norris and his supporters. Oscar Piastri Max Verstappen
  Isack Hadjar George Russell Alex Albon Ollie Bearman Lance Stroll Fernando
  Alonso Yuki Tsunoda Esteban Ocon Franco Colapinto Liam Lawson Carlos Sainz
  Nico Hulkenberg Gabriel Bortoleto Kimi Antonelli Pierre Gasly DNF: Lando
  Norris, Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. He began on pole and went
  unchallenged throughout to take a massive victory in the context of this
  year’s World Championship. With Lando Norris returning no points after
  retiring, it’s a massive moment in the title race. Advantage Piastri. Max
  Verstappen comes in second in his home race, with Isack Hadjar third – a first
  ever podium for the young Racing Bulls driver. We’ll run through the final
  standings in the next post… Into the last lap! Piastri is looking very secure,
  surely set for a seventh GP triumph of the season. Lap 69/72: This is it.
  Piastri powers away in first, desperately trying to escape Verstappen’s
  clutches. Can Russell chase down Hadjar and finish third? There’s a lot to
  happen but not much time left in which it can happen. Will we finish this race
  in safety car conditions, or will we get a lap or two of racing? Lap 68/72:
  The safety car is still out but when we resume racing Piastri will be
  challenged by Verstappen, with Hadjar sensing an amazing chance to finish on
  the podium. Lando Norris sits in the sand dunes on the radio to his team
  looking completely dejected. He gets a good ovation from the crowd as he
  trudges back. Norris will likely trail Piastri by 34 points at the end of this
  race, which isn’t unusable but is a big margin to overhaul. So it’s a third
  DNF of the race and a third appearance for the safety car. Norris wasn’t in
  line to win the race but he would likely have snatched second, so that’s a
  good deal of points he’s missing out on. A boost for Piastri, although not one
  for McLaren. Lando Norris has been forced to retire. The red brake lights are
  on and he cannot continue. It’s a shake of the head for the Brit in the
  cockpit. Something went massively wrong for him and his race is done. Well,
  well, well. Why on earth did the McLarens go to hard tyres with about 15 laps
  left? Aren’t they sitting ducks for Verstappen now? That’s an email from Beau
  Dure. Maybe not given Verstappen seems to have an issue of his own … although
  Norris has just said he smells something funny and could have an engine
  problem! Lap 64/72: Pierre Gasly is tumbling down the field and, on those
  older tyres, has been surpassed by a speedy Ollie Bearman. The young Haas
  driver began this race in the pit lane but is currently P8 and in the points,
  and could finish even higher. Max Verstappen isn’t happy on the Red Bull
  radio. He seems to think the car is running out of steam. Can he cling onto a
  spot on the podium? Lap 62/72: Into the final 10 laps of this race. Antonelli
  has indeed been given another five-second penalty. It never rains, but it
  pours… Lap 59/72: Tsunoda speeds beyond Bortoleto to sit P11. Pierre Gasly is
  P8 and under severe pressure from Alonso. And Antonelli, nominally seventh, is
  under another investigation, this time for speeding in the pit lane. Lap
  58/72: Piastri has enough speed to get away at the front again, with
  Verstappen chasing Norris – again with good pace – in the race for second.
  Hadjar is still fourth, Russell fifth and down the grid, Bearman and Alonso
  are making strides up the field. Back racing. Sainz has served his 10-second
  penalty and is now P18 at the back of the pack. Anontelli hasn’t yet served
  his. Lap 57/72: We’re still roaming round in a holding pattern. How many laps
  of racing will we have left in Zandvoort? The answer is… around 14. It’s about
  to end. Antonelli has been handed a 10-second penalty for causing a collision.
  Which is fair and difficult to argue with. Lap 55/72: A double DNF for Ferrari
  is the upshot, anyway, although Antonelli may face an investigation. He seemed
  like he understeered a little, not leaving enough room for Leclerc to stay on
  the track. A second Ferrari has crashed out of this race, an absolute disaster
  for the The Prancing Horse. But while Hamilton’s crash was of his own making,
  a replay could reveal that Leclerc’s exit from the race was actually down to
  Kimi Antonelli. The two were battling hard, but Leclerc says it was
  “unnecessary” from the Mercedes. Inevitably, everyone is going into the pit
  lane. Now Leclerc hits the pit lane and comes out just in front of Antonelli…
  oh no that’s another big crash for a Ferrari! He’s spun out of control and is
  done. Goodness me. Lap 52/72: Fernando Alonso is trying to charge through the
  field, on fairly fresh tyres. He’s zipped swiftly past Hulkenberg. Antonelli
  has gone in for fresh tyres, so will fancy his chances of catching Alex Albon.
  Lewis Hamilton reflects on his early exit from the race. Speaking to Sky
  Sports, he says: “As I went on the bank, the rear snapped out and I couldn’t
  recover. The car was a bit twitchy but I think we made real progress this
  weekend, my pace was good and I was catching George. It feels very unusual to
  not finish a race and to go out so early.” Lap 48/72: Oh, Lando. Piastri has
  pushed back and the lead is back at 1.5 seconds. I don’t see how on earth the
  Brit can get close enough to execute his move here. “Who gets a penalty? Me?
  Are you joking? This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard in my life!”
  That’s Carlos Sainz’s baffled reaction to being given a 10-second penalty,
  which he will serve in the pit lane. That’s due to his clash with Liam Lawson
  earlier on. Lap 45/72: 1.2 seconds. Lando is really pushing! Norris has now
  closed the gap to around 1.4 seconds. It’s not closing fast enough from his
  perspective. Piastri still sitting pretty. Lap 42/72: George Russell has been
  told to let teammate Kimi Antonelli past him, due to the damage sustained by
  the Briton’s Mercedes. Russell complied but didn’t sound too thrilled with it.
  Lap 40/72: There’s been some chat about some of these teams/drivers using a
  one-stop policy today, but there’s a lot of racing left to do. Verstappen is
  on medium tyres so I can’t see him going the whole way. Lap 39/72: At the
  front of the race, Piastri has re-established that comfortable lead he built
  before the safety car(s) came out. Norris is pushing damn hard but the gap is
  at least 1.5 seconds, albeit closing a little. Inevitably, race control are
  looking into that Russell-Leclerc skirmish. Neither were happy about the
  behaviour of their rival. Who was in the wrong? Lap 35/72: Leclerc,
  undeterred, sets his sights on Hadjar next. Let’s see if he gets a penalty.
  “He was fully off the track, surely?” asks Russell on the radio, referring to
  that move by Leclerc to overtake him. The replay suggests Russell may be
  right. One for the stewards, that … Lap 33/72: We keep saying Hadjar could
  come under some pressure… yet he remains P4 having held off all and sundry so
  far. A great job by the marshal, appropriately decked out in an orange
  fluorescent jacket, to remove the debris. And wow… as we get racing again,
  Leclerc goes wheel to wheel with Russell. The Ferrari man wins the initial
  battle but back comes Russell to try and win back fifth spot. Great stuff to
  watch. Lap 31/72: There’s some debris on the track so we’ve got a virtual
  safety car now. We’ve had a bit of everything in the first half of this race.
  Apparently that’s Hamilton’s first ever DNF in Ferrari red. A major shame for
  the Briton. Lap 29/72: There was a slight knock between Sainz and Lawson after
  that restart. “He’s so stupid, it’s always the same guy,” said the Williams
  driver, presumably referring to Lawson. Both had to pit after sustaining a bit
  of damage. As they race again, Russell, who has leapt into fifth, is now
  targeting fourth as he sits on Hadjar’s tail. The other Mercedes, Antonelli,
  has also jumped up. He’s now P8. Lap 27/72: We’re racing again! Norris has
  just had a bit of a contretemps with his team. The front jack wasn’t pulled
  away quick enough by the McLaren engineers when he pitted… and he was also
  unhappy they hadn’t communicated about the slippy paint which seemed to be at
  fault for Hamilton’s crash. Lap 25/72: We’re now in a holding pattern, so
  Piastri’s healthy lead has been reduced. The Australian will hope it won’t be
  too long before they’re all racing again. The safety car will come out now to
  deal with that incident, with Lewis Hamilton stricken. He just went too wide
  and sustained some major damage. Thankfully he’s OK. “Sorry guys,” he says on
  the radio. The two McLarens have gone into the pit lane, the ol’ “double
  stack” move. Plenty of other drivers are boxing too. Hamilton has hit the
  barriers! Oh wow, that’s a disaster … Lap 23/72: Both the Ferraris have seemed
  pretty quick today, although Hamilton has told his engineers they’ll have to
  “undercut these guys… it’s pretty hard to get past”. That’s classic Zandvoort,
  I’m afraid Lew. Lap 21/72: Loads of drivers are now heading for the pit stop
  and most are emerging on harder tyres. 20 laps gone. Here’s how the top 10
  currently stand with Stroll and Alonso 19th and 20th respectively having
  pitted: Piastri Norris Verstappen Hadjar Leclerc Russell Hamilton Lawson Sainz
  Albon We’re expecting most of the drivers and teams to employ a two-stop
  strategy today. Verstappen, remember is the only one in the current top 10 on
  softer tyres so will probably have to box earlier. The rain has been much
  discussed but it’s hardly lashing down. Most Brits would call this a normal
  summer’s day. Lap 17/72: Piastri’s lead at the front is sitting at a
  comfortable three seconds. He’ll be delighted with that, although with
  conditions changing it’s not signed and sealed just yet. Lap 15/72: Kimi
  Antonelli has been enjoying the benefit of DRS and is using it to apply
  serious pressure to Yuki Tsunoda. And yet there’s still no way past the Red
  Bull, in that battle for 11th place. Lap 13/72: Ollie Bearman says “he’s a bit
  scared” about Bortoleto’s front wing. Somebody tell race control! Fair enough,
  really. Lap 12/72: Leclerc cannot wrestle his way past Hadjar… yet. Feels like
  a matter of time that one. The Ferrari has been quicker so far. The Haas
  drivers are on harder tyres and Lance Stroll has dipped into the pit lane to
  get some hard tyres on too. An interesting decision with rain in the air … Lap
  9/72: Brilliant from Norris! He executes a fine move to squeeze past
  Verstappen and he’s got second place back. That’ll make him feel a damn sight
  better. “Nice job, let’s go get Oscar,” he chirps on the team radio. Fair play
  to Isack Hadjar. He started fourth on the grid, a best ever result for him in
  qualifying, and has found some speed to hold off the likes of Leclerc and
  Russell to hang on to P4. Lap 7/72: Gabriel Bortoleto has a damaged front
  wing, I think from a slight knock with Lance Stroll, with the Sauber driver
  now in 19th, only Bearman – who began in the pit lane – behind him. Looking
  back at that first corner, Verstappen generated serious pace but almost lost
  control, going away from the racing line, yet then recovered in incredible
  style. Norris had pace off the start but couldn’t live with the Red Bull
  driver and was pushed into third. Lap 5/72: There’s already some rain in the
  Zandvoort air, which could spice things up for sure. Piastri now boasts a two
  second lead at the front of this race. There may be 60-odd laps to follow, but
  it’s hard to see anyone overhauling that deficit. Lap 3/72: They’re all pretty
  bunched up in the middle, with Hadjar increasingly under threat from a load of
  cars who sense he doesn’t have too much speed. One man who does have speed is
  Verstappen. He’s already a second and a half ahead of the man he overtook,
  Norris. Lap 2/72: Fernando Alonso has dropped a few places and Hadjar is
  already under pressure, with Russell and Leclerc chasing down the Racing Bull.
  The Williams cars of Sainz and Albon are in the top 10 as things stand. Max
  Verstappen steamed into second place with a rapid start and Piastri was quick
  enough to see off any threat to his position. More on the other places in the
  next post … … and away we goooooooo! Formation lap time. Get some heat into
  those wheels. Most of the drivers are using medium tyres, with Verstappen one
  of the few on the softer tyres. Apparently Lewis Hamilton is being
  investigated for some kind of infringement and will be spoken to after the
  race. The Dutch crowd are a sea of red, white and blue, with plenty of orange,
  as we prepare for lights out. More than 300,000 fans are packing the stands.
  George Russell is back on his scooter and says “it won’t be straightforward if
  I don’t get past him at the start” – referring to Isack Hadjar, the Racing
  Bulls youngster, who qualified in fourth, a place ahead of the Mercedes man. A
  spot on the podium has been a regular resting place for Russell this season
  and could be within reach again. Xavi Simons, now of Tottenham Hotspur, is
  being interviewed on the grid. He says he’s been to a few races before. He’s
  supporting Max Verstappen. Thanks Xavi. It’s now mad busy on the grid. This
  part of an F1 race weekend is always a bit strange and annoying, in my humble
  view. Not long now. Lando Norris has been chatting to Sky Sports about how on
  earth he can get past Piastri this afternoon: “It’s not the easiest track to
  overtake on but it’s also not impossible, but when you’re so closely matched
  with your teammate it can also make things trickier. “We will see and it’s a
  little bit more limiting to options I could have because it is my teammate,
  but not impossible. I will see what I can come up with.” Dutch Grand Prix
  recent winners: 2024 – Lando Norris (McLaren) 2023 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull)
  2022 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 2021 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull) Can
  Verstappen take another victory in his home race, from third place on the
  grid? It’d be some effort to usurp the McLarens. Sky Sports are showing a
  montage of all the great intra-team title battles over the years, given the
  rivalry between Piastri and Norris right now. From Ayrton Senna v Alain Prost,
  to Damon Hill v Jacques Villeneuve, to Lewis Hamilton v Fernando Alonso –
  there have been some crackers down the decades. Remember Piastri currently
  holds a nine-point lead over his McLaren teammate going into today’s race.
  McLaren are home and hosed in the constructors’ championship, leading Ferrari
  by a whopping 299 points. Right, around 45 minutes until lights out at
  Zandvoort. Lots of last-minute checks and adjustments are going on in the
  garages, while the grid is inevitably filling up with relevant (and some
  irrelevant) people. Our man Giles Richards sat down for a big chinwag with the
  World Championship leader Oscar Piastri in the Netherlands earlier this
  weekend. “I have emotions, I still feel everything that everyone else feels.
  It’s just that, being blunt, I think a lot of emotions are not that helpful.”
  Read the full interview here: Piastri Norris Verstappen Hadjar Russell Leclerc
  Hamilton Lawson Sainz Alonso Antonelli Tsunoda Bortoleto Gasly Albon Colapinto
  Hulkenberg Ocon Stroll With Haas fitting new components to Ollie Bearman’s
  car, he will start in the pit lane. As Jeremy Corbyn once gleefully said,
  we’re back and we’re ready to do it all over again. After a near-month-long
  summer break, a Formula One grand prix is finally back on our screens, with
  Oscar Piastri on pole for this Dutch GP. That Piastri qualified just 0.012
  seconds ahead of his McLaren teammate Lando Norris was a sore point for the
  British driver as he spoke to the media yesterday. On a track where overtaking
  is notoriously difficult – virtually impossible if you believe Norris – he
  admitted he’d need a spot of magic to overcome Piastri this afternoon. “It’s
  going to take some magic, some good strategy or incredible tyre saving or
  something,” Norris said on how he can win at Zandvoort. On not nabbing pole
  position, he said: “Just a bummer … but not a lot I can do now. My lap was
  still pretty good, 0.01secs is such a small margin. It is frustrating mainly
  because it is a track that is pretty much impossible to overtake on, so a lot
  of my chances are now gone.” So will it be a procession for Piastri or can
  Norris nick something in the Netherlands? We get under way at 2pm (BST), 3pm
  local time.

Both had to pit after sustaining a bit of damage. As they race again, Russell, who has leapt into fifth, is now targeting fourth as he sits on Hadjar’s tail. The other Mercedes, Antonelli, has also jumped up. He’s now P8. Lap 27/72: We’re racing again! Norris has just had a bit of a contretemps with his team. The front jack wasn’t pulled away quick enough by the McLaren engineers when he pitted… and he was also unhappy they hadn’t communicated about the slippy paint which seemed to be at fault for Hamilton’s crash. Lap 25/72: We’re now in a holding pattern, so Piastri’s healthy lead has been reduced. The Australian will hope it won’t be too long before they’re all racing again. The safety car will come out now to deal with that incident, with Lewis Hamilton stricken. He just went too wide and sustained some major damage. Thankfully he’s OK. “Sorry guys,” he says on the radio. The two McLarens have gone into the pit lane, the ol’ “double stack” move. Plenty of other drivers are boxing too. Hamilton has hit the barriers! Oh wow, that’s a disaster … Lap 23/72: Both the Ferraris have seemed pretty quick today, although Hamilton has told his engineers they’ll have to “undercut these guys… it’s pretty hard to get past”. That’s classic Zandvoort, I’m afraid Lew. Lap 21/72: Loads of drivers are now heading for the pit stop and most are emerging on harder tyres. 20 laps gone. Here’s how the top 10 currently stand with Stroll and Alonso 19th and 20th respectively having pitted: Piastri Norris Verstappen Hadjar Leclerc Russell Hamilton Lawson Sainz Albon We’re expecting most of the drivers and teams to employ a two-stop strategy today. Verstappen, remember is the only one in the current top 10 on softer tyres so will probably have to box earlier. The rain has been much discussed but it’s hardly lashing down. Most Brits would call this a normal summer’s day. Lap 17/72: Piastri’s lead at the front is sitting at a comfortable three seconds. He’ll be delighted with that, although with conditions changing it’s not signed and sealed just yet. Lap 15/72: Kimi Antonelli has been enjoying the benefit of DRS and is using it to apply serious pressure to Yuki Tsunoda. And yet there’s still no way past the Red Bull, in that battle for 11th place. Lap 13/72: Ollie Bearman says “he’s a bit scared” about Bortoleto’s front wing. Somebody tell race control! Fair enough, really. Lap 12/72: Leclerc cannot wrestle his way past Hadjar… yet. Feels like a matter of time that one. The Ferrari has been quicker so far. The Haas drivers are on harder tyres and Lance Stroll has dipped into the pit lane to get some hard tyres on too. An interesting decision with rain in the air … Lap 9/72: Brilliant from Norris! He executes a fine move to squeeze past Verstappen and he’s got second place back. That’ll make him feel a damn sight better. “Nice job, let’s go get Oscar,” he chirps on the team radio. Fair play to Isack Hadjar. He started fourth on the grid, a best ever result for him in qualifying, and has found some speed to hold off the likes of Leclerc and Russell to hang on to P4. Lap 7/72: Gabriel Bortoleto has a damaged front wing, I think from a slight knock with Lance Stroll, with the Sauber driver now in 19th, only Bearman – who began in the pit lane – behind him. Looking back at that first corner, Verstappen generated serious pace but almost lost control, going away from the racing line, yet then recovered in incredible style. Norris had pace off the start but couldn’t live with the Red Bull driver and was pushed into third. Lap 5/72: There’s already some rain in the Zandvoort air, which could spice things up for sure. Piastri now boasts a two second lead at the front of this race. There may be 60-odd laps to follow, but it’s hard to see anyone overhauling that deficit. Lap 3/72: They’re all pretty bunched up in the middle, with Hadjar increasingly under threat from a load of cars who sense he doesn’t have too much speed. One man who does have speed is Verstappen. He’s already a second and a half ahead of the man he overtook, Norris. Lap 2/72: Fernando Alonso has dropped a few places and Hadjar is already under pressure, with Russell and Leclerc chasing down the Racing Bull. The Williams cars of Sainz and Albon are in the top 10 as things stand. Max Verstappen steamed into second place with a rapid start and Piastri was quick enough to see off any threat to his position. More on the other places in the next post … … and away we goooooooo! Formation lap time. Get some heat into those wheels. Most of the drivers are using medium tyres, with Verstappen one of the few on the softer tyres. Apparently Lewis Hamilton is being investigated for some kind of infringement and will be spoken to after the race. The Dutch crowd are a sea of red, white and blue, with plenty of orange, as we prepare for lights out. More than 300,000 fans are packing the stands. George Russell is back on his scooter and says “it won’t be straightforward if I don’t get past him at the start” – referring to Isack Hadjar, the Racing Bulls youngster, who qualified in fourth, a place ahead of the Mercedes man. A spot on the podium has been a regular resting place for Russell this season and could be within reach again. Xavi Simons, now of Tottenham Hotspur, is being interviewed on the grid. He says he’s been to a few races before. He’s supporting Max Verstappen. Thanks Xavi. It’s now mad busy on the grid. This part of an F1 race weekend is always a bit strange and annoying, in my humble view. Not long now. Lando Norris has been chatting to Sky Sports about how on earth he can get past Piastri this afternoon: “It’s not the easiest track to overtake on but it’s also not impossible, but when you’re so closely matched with your teammate it can also make things trickier. “We will see and it’s a little bit more limiting to options I could have because it is my teammate, but not impossible. I will see what I can come up with.” Dutch Grand Prix recent winners: 2024 – Lando Norris (McLaren) 2023 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 2022 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 2021 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull) Can Verstappen take another victory in his home race, from third place on the grid? It’d be some effort to usurp the McLarens. Sky Sports are showing a montage of all the great intra-team title battles over the years, given the rivalry between Piastri and Norris right now. From Ayrton Senna v Alain Prost, to Damon Hill v Jacques Villeneuve, to Lewis Hamilton v Fernando Alonso – there have been some crackers down the decades. Remember Piastri currently holds a nine-point lead over his McLaren teammate going into today’s race. McLaren are home and hosed in the constructors’ championship, leading Ferrari by a whopping 299 points. Right, around 45 minutes until lights out at Zandvoort. Lots of last-minute checks and adjustments are going on in the garages, while the grid is inevitably filling up with relevant (and some irrelevant) people. Our man Giles Richards sat down for a big chinwag with the World Championship leader Oscar Piastri in the Netherlands earlier this weekend. “I have emotions, I still feel everything that everyone else feels. It’s just that, being blunt, I think a lot of emotions are not that helpful.” Read the full interview here: Piastri Norris Verstappen Hadjar Russell Leclerc Hamilton Lawson Sainz Alonso Antonelli Tsunoda Bortoleto Gasly Albon Colapinto Hulkenberg Ocon Stroll With Haas fitting new components to Ollie Bearman’s car, he will start in the pit lane. As Jeremy Corbyn once gleefully said, we’re back and we’re ready to do it all over again. After a near-month-long summer break, a Formula One grand prix is finally back on our screens, with Oscar Piastri on pole for this Dutch GP. That Piastri qualified just 0.012 seconds ahead of his McLaren teammate Lando Norris was a sore point for the British driver as he spoke to the media yesterday. On a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult – virtually impossible if you believe Norris – he admitted he’d need a spot of magic to overcome Piastri this afternoon. “It’s going to take some magic, some good strategy or incredible tyre saving or something,” Norris said on how he can win at Zandvoort. On not nabbing pole position, he said: “Just a bummer … but not a lot I can do now. My lap was still pretty good, 0.01secs is such a small margin. It is frustrating mainly because it is a track that is pretty much impossible to overtake on, so a lot of my chances are now gone.” So will it be a procession for Piastri or can Norris nick something in the Netherlands? We get under way at 2pm (BST), 3pm local time.
