  student results, Productivity Commission says

  A national online database of lesson plans would help teachers cut hours from
  their weekly workloads and help reverse years of stagnating student results,
  the Productivity Commission says. The commission’s fourth interim report on
  how to lift Australia’s flagging productivity focused on building a skilled
  and adaptable workforce. Naplan test results show one in three school students
  don’t meet minimum literacy or numeracy standards, and Catherine de Fontenay,
  one of two commissioners leading the inquiry, said “anything that improves our
  foundational skills in schools is going to have the biggest impact on
  productivity”. The commission said it “repeatedly” heard during consultations
  that the tools and resources available to teachers varied between
  jurisdictions and sectors, while not all states and territories had developed
  lesson planning materials to share through a database. The commonwealth should
  invest and promote a single online platform containing the materials, the
  report said, with the understanding plans would be adapted for local contexts
  and for the wide range of students’ abilities. The commission also said the
  federal government should take the lead in devising a national approach to
  education technology in schools, including tools using artificial
  intelligence. “Effective implementation of both reforms requires collaboration
  and buy-in from state and territory governments, school sectors, school
  leaders and teachers,” the report said. De Fontenay said the inquiry had
  revealed a lack of coordination around how to use AI in the classroom. “What
  we found is that all the states are on a journey. A lot of them are at the
  (stage) of trying to ban the use of GenAI, with various levels of success,”
  she said. While some state school directorates are focused on the risks,
  others are developing their own GenAI tools, including Educhat in NSW. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email “Teachers are in a very difficult situation right
  now,” De Fontenay said. “All continue to experiment and try out different
  technologies, but in the midst of the fear there is lots of potential as well.
  “For a kid who is struggling, AI can tailor the next question based on how
  they are doing on earlier questions, and then give them work that targets
  their weaknesses. “There’s a lot of potential, but there are always risks.
  This has to be a collective agreement in terms of how to proceed.” A week out
  from treasurer Jim Chalmers’ economic reform roundtable, the commission also
  recommended easing regulatory restrictions around the jobs Australians are
  able to perform, which it said were exacerbating skills shortages. “They
  should start by considering occupations – including motor vehicle repairers,
  painters and decorators, and hairdressers – where OERs [occupational entry
  regulations] apply in only some jurisdictions and are not demonstrably
  improving outcomes.” De Fontenay said it was not a question of doing away with
  minimum requirements, but pushing back against creeping “credentialism”. “It’s
  more a question of proportionality. Audits are a good example. Right now the
  level of auditor requirements are the same as if you are auditing BHP or a
  small enterprise. We think there should be a lower tier risk of licence with
  simpler requirements,” she said. In aged care, the demands and expense of
  educational requirements could be a barrier to somebody with a natural
  aptitude, De Fontenay said. “We don’t want to see people who are really suited
  to this type of work prevented by excessive entry requirements. “And in
  particular, we’d like to see in remote communities that it’s easier for people
  to receive culturally safe care from people in their communities.” The interim
  report also proposed initiatives to boost the skills of those already in the
  workforce. The commission recommended providing financial incentives,
  potentially in the form of a tax credit, to small and medium-sized businesses
  who invest in training their staff. The report also backed better recognition
  of prior education and making it easier for students to claim credit for other
  study. “AI is very much on everyone’s minds, but occupational change has been
  a big feature of labour markets here and overseas,” De Fontenay said. “We need
  to prepare people to change occupations when their preferences change, or when
  their professions shrink or evolve.”
