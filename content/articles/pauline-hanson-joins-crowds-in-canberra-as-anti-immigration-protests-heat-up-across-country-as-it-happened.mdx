  That’s it from me, Graham Readfearn, and from our live news coverage for the
  day. But first a quick recap. Thousands attended anti-immigration around the
  country at about 20 locations, under the banner “March for Australia”. There
  were angry scenes in Melbourne where police used pepper spray as they tried to
  keep counter protests seperate. A neo-Nazi was among the speakers at there.
  Federal MP Bob Katter in Townsville and One Nation senators Pauline Hanson and
  Malcolm Roberts in Canberra have been with the March for Australia protestors.
  The wife of suspected police killer Dezi Freeman has urged the sovereign
  citizen to surrender as police entered a sixth day searching for him in bush
  around Porepunkah in northern Victoria. Shadow immigration minister Julian
  Leeser argued the Albanese government’s support for Palestine had created the
  atmosphere that encouraged “lowlife criminals” to attack Jewish community
  buildings last year. A man and a woman were stabbed by two men who entered
  their southwest Sydney home wearing face coverings, in what officers think was
  a case of mistaken identity. The two were in a stable condition in hospital.
  Three children under 10 were also in the home but were not injured. Race
  records were broken in Sydney’s marathon this morning, where there were 35,000
  runners registered for the run’s debut as a world major marathon. Thanks for
  sticking with us and stay safe. Have a good evening. Here’s our full story
  just published on the anti-immigration rallies that took place around
  Australia today, where thousands turned out draped with Australian flags. My
  colleagues Stephanie Convery and Natasha May write that a neo-Nazi was among
  the speakers at a tense rally in Melbourne. Politicians from One Nation and
  Katter’s Australia party were among those attending rallies in Canberra and
  Townsville. Here’s a recap on what’s happened so far today. Anti-immigration
  rallies have been taking place around the country at about 20 locations, under
  the banner “March for Australia”. There have been angry scenes in Melbourne
  where police tried to keep counter protests seperate. Federal MP Bob Katter in
  Townsville and One Nation senators Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts in
  Canberra have been with the March for Australia protesters. The wife of
  suspected police killer Dezi Freeman has urged the ‘“sovereign citizen” to
  surrender as police entered a sixth day searching for him in bush around
  Porepunkah in northern Victoria. The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser,
  argued the Albanese government’s position on Israel had created the atmosphere
  that encouraged “lowlife criminals” to attack Jewish community buildings last
  year. Race records were broken in Sydney’s marathon this morning, where there
  were 35,000 runners registered for the run’s debut as a world major marathon.
  Stay with us for the rest of the day. Sydney marathon photo gallery There have
  been a few records broken today in Sydney for the city’s marathon, reportedly
  the biggest in Australia history where 35,000 registered to run. Here’s how
  the city looked this morning for the race – the first time the Sydney event
  has been an official Abbott World Marathon Major, putting it alongside the
  likes of the famous marathons of Boston, London and New York. Bob Katter at
  Townsville anti-immigration rally The ABC has reported that about 400 people
  attended the anti-immigration march in Townsville, and that it was led by
  members of the party founded by federal MP Bob Katter. Footage showed Katter’s
  Australia party members, including Queensland state MPs Nick Dametto and
  Robbie Katter, standing alongside the federal member for Kennedy, Bob Katter.
  According to the ABC, the day has so far passed without incident in the north
  Queensland town. Bob Katter made headlines earlier this week when he made
  threatening moves towards Nine journalist Josh Bavas, after Bavas had asked
  about Katter’s Lebanese heritage. The anti-immigration rally in Melbourne has
  reached the state parliament, taking a circuitous route via Bourke St mall. I
  can’t see the speaker from where I’m standing, but the man with a microphone
  says: “Australians are sick and tired of the rising tide of mass immigration
  in this country.” He then leads a chant of “Albo must go”, followed by “Aussie
  Aussie Aussie”, which the crowd bellows in unison. The antifascist
  counter-protest was pushed back from the Collins/Elizabeth intersection by
  police in riot gear, and around a dozen protesters were pepper-sprayed in the
  process. They haven’t made it up to parliament. New powers for Services
  Australia to waive debts incurred through family violence Victim-survivors of
  financial abuse will no longer be saddled with social security debt from an
  abusive partner, following a change to the rules that will allow some of those
  debts to be waived. The changes, announced this morning, are part of a push to
  protect those affected by family violence and coercive control from financial
  abuse by a partner. Services Australia will now have the power to waive social
  security debts incurred as a result of family violence, but will also be able
  to consider circumstances including mental capacity, the impact of natural
  disasters and homelessness. The social services minister, Tanya Plibersek,
  said the social services system should “be a part of the solution, not part of
  the problem” for victim-survivors of family violence. She said: Every victim
  survivor who relies on our social security system should feel like they can
  trust that the system will keep them safe. It should be part of the solution,
  not part of the problem … This is an important first step toward our landmark
  election commitment to stop perpetrators using Commonwealth systems to abuse
  their partners. Economic Justice Australia has “wholeheartedly welcomed” the
  change and says it will help victim survivors of family violence access
  justice, and leave abusive circumstances. Its chief executive, Kate Allingham,
  says: People have had their measly social security payments further reduced to
  repay these debts, taking food off the table and adding significant financial
  pressure on families … This change to the legislation is a no-brainer, and
  will result in a much fairer outcome for people in incredibly vulnerable and
  distressing situations. Melbourne: bottles thrown as opposing protests cross
  paths The anti-immigration march and the counter demonstration have just met
  at the corner of Collins St and Elizabeth St. There’s a barrier of police
  between them, three rows deep, including police on horseback, but that hasn’t
  stopped verbal confrontation. Someone has just thrown a bottle into the front
  line of the antifascist counter-rally – it smashed at their feet – and a can
  of beer has just gone flying over the police line towards the anti-immigration
  march. AAP have pictures of the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, and senator
  Malcolm Roberts at the anti-mass immigration rally being held in Canberra:
  Canberra: anti-immigration protesters and counter-protest cause traffic delays
  A crowd of what appears to be a few hundred has gathered and chanted at
  Canberra’s anti-immigration rally, on the edge of Lake Burley Griffin. With a
  view of Parliament House across the lake, several hundred people waved
  Australian flags or wore them as capes. A smaller counter-rally across the
  road was kept separate by police, with officers forming a perimeter to keep
  the groups apart. The counter-rally chanted phrases like “immigrants are
  welcome here”, as well as a chant ending in “walk into the fucking lake”. The
  anti-immigration rally is making its way across the Commonwealth Avenue
  Bridge, potentially toward Parliament House. At least one lane on the bridge
  looks blocked by police for protesters to march – it’s causing major delays on
  Canberra’s main arterial road from north to south, including a fire truck with
  lights and blaring sirens which is trying to make its way down the road.
  Others didn’t walk across the bridge. Two young women in a car drove past the
  counter-rally, playing Men At Work’s Land Down Under on their stereo, singing
  loudly and raising their middle fingers at the counter-protesters. Melbourne:
  police in riot gear approach counter-protesters The anti-immigration March for
  Australia rally has been stuck in at Flinders St intersection for a couple of
  hours now, while the counter rally has come down Swanston St but been stopped
  by police lines at Collins Street. The tension is growing among those at
  Flinders Street. There are increasing chants of “let us march”, and disputes
  between people with loudspeakers about which way to march; some are trying to
  draw people down to the Shrine, others insist the destination is Parliament
  House, but it’s hard to see how that would happen with the police lines and
  counter demonstration. Police in riot gear have started approaching the edges
  of the demonstration. Anti-immigration rallies and marches are under way
  Anti-immigration marches and rallies are getting under way now across
  Australia. A livestream on the Instagram account of Free Palestine Melbourne –
  a group part of a counter rally in the city – is showing large crowds and
  constant and sometimes angry chanting, with a heavy police presence. So far it
  appears the police have kept the opposing groups well apart. Here is the full
  statement from Amalia Freeman, the wife of Dezi Freeman, who is currently on
  the run from police after allegedly shooting dead two police officers. On
  behalf of my children and myself, I wish to share our deep sorrow for the loss
  of the lives of Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior
  Constable Vadim De Waart on 26 August 2025. We are truly sorry for your loss,
  and the suffering and grief that the families, friends and colleagues of
  Detective Leading Senior Constable Thompson and Senior Constable De Waart are
  now experiencing. My children and I grieve for the loss of your loved ones. My
  children and I respect the important work of Victoria Police and do not hold
  anti-authority views. We echo the requests of the Victoria Police for the
  swift and safe conclusion of this tragedy. I lend my full support to Victoria
  Police in their search for my husband and will co-operate with Victoria Police
  in any way that I can. Please Dezi, if you see or hear this, call 000 and
  arrange a surrender plan with the police. If anyone is harbouring, helping or
  supporting Dezi, please call 000 immediately and speak with the police. If
  anyone has seen Dezi or knows anything that may help the police to understand
  his whereabouts, even if it is just a snippet of information, please call 000
  immediately. The wife of Dezi Freeman – the man accused of shooting dead two
  Victorian police officers – has pleaded with him to surrender in a statement
  provided to the ABC. Police have started the sixth day of the search for
  Freeman who is accused of killing two Victorian police officers. According to
  the ABC, Freeman’s wife, Amalia Freeman, said she had “deep sorrow” for the
  deaths of the two officers. The statement said: On behalf of my children and
  myself, I wish to share our deep sorrow for the loss of the lives of the
  detective leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim de
  Waart. We are truly sorry for your loss and the suffering and grief that the
  families, friends and colleagues of the men are now experiencing. My children
  and I respect the important work of Victoria Police and do not hold
  anti-authoritarian views. The ABC said the statement had echoed the requests
  of Victoria police for “a swift and safe conclusion to this tragedy.” The
  statement added: I lend my full support to Victoria Police in their search for
  my husband and will co-operate with Victoria Police in any way that I can.
  Please Dezi, if you see or hear this, call 000 and arrange a surrender plan
  with the police. Melbourne anti-immigration rally starts More here from our
  reporter Stephanie Convery who is in Melbourne at the scene of one of the
  anti-immigration marches taking place across the country. Police are trying to
  keep opposing groups apart. The anti-immigration rally at Flinders Street
  intersection was supposed to start at 12pm but it was full of Australian flags
  by 11.30, and chants of “Aussie Aussie Aussie, oi oi oi”. A few placards: one
  reads “Mass immigration = silent invasion”. Police have blocked off Flinders
  St and Swanston St to the north of the intersection, which seems designed to
  keep two rallies apart. There’s a man on a loudspeaker who is addressing his
  remarks directly to the police. It’s hard to hear what he’s saying but it
  seems to include something “in the name of the king”, which suggests pseudolaw
  rhetoric. A second antifascist counter-demonstration has already established
  itself at the intersection of Swanston Street and Flinders Lane, and are
  chanting while being pushed back, away from the anti-immigration rally by a
  line of police on horseback. The mood is already quite volatile. I’ve just
  seen police push at least two protesters to the ground as they move them back.
  Pro-Palestine and antifascist groups gather in Melbourne ahead of
  anti-immigration march I’m out the front of the State Library of Victoria
  where hundreds of people have gathered to protest against the far right and
  show solidarity with Palestine. This weekend, the regular pro-Palestine rally
  has met earlier than usual and merged with an antifascist
  counter-demonstration to protest against the anti-immigration March for
  Australia, which is gathering at the Flinders Street station intersection. The
  northernmost end of St Kilda Road from the National Gallery of Victoria and
  Queens Bridge has been blocked off since earlier this morning, and a large
  police presence established around and throughout Flinders Street station
  itself. There are marches planned across Australia today, including at all the
  state capitals, many scheduled to start at noon. March organisers say there
  are more than 20 protests planned today. Two stabbed in home invasion in
  ‘mistaken identity’ case in Sydney’s west Police in Sydney’s south-west have
  reported a home invasion last night where a man and a woman were stabbed by
  two men who entered their home wearing face coverings, in what officers think
  was a case of mistaken identity. Emergency services were called to a house at
  McCredie Road in Guildford West at 11pm last night and police established a
  crime scene. NSW police say the two men fled the scene when neighbours
  intervened. Three children under 10 were also in the home but were not
  injured. A 41-year-old man and 37-year-old woman living at the home were taken
  to hospital in a stable condition. Police said the alleged invaders were seen
  getting in to a white sedan parked out the front of the home that was driven
  by a third person south along Lomond Street. Police have asked anyone with
  information or who were in the area at the time with any available dashcam or
  mobile phone footage to contact Granville police station or Crime Stoppers on
  1800 333 000. South Australia in world-first ban of fish-shaped soy sauce
  containers They’re called shoyu-tai – the tiny fish-shaped soy sauce
  containers that have been a staple of sushi take-away joints for years. But
  from tomorrow, they will be banned in South Australia in a world-first step.
  My colleague Eelemarni Close-Brown has this story. Police in Victoria looking
  for Dezi Freeman – the “sovereign citizen” who allegedly shot two police
  officers – say there have been several reported sightings of him. The search
  for Freeman has started its sixth day this morning with hundreds of officers
  searching the bush around the town of Porepunkah. Victoria police’s chief
  commissioner, Mike Bush, said none of the sightings had been confirmed as
  Freeman. Police have charged a 61-year-old man arrested yesterday with
  possessing an imitation firearm and possessing cannabis, alleging the items
  were from the house they found him in. Whether the man was associated with
  Freeman was part of inquiries, police said. Asked about the planned
  anti-immigration protests across Australia today, Julian Leeser says he’s
  concerned about some of the anti-Indian and antisemitic sentiment being
  expressed. But he also adds that there are people who will be attending these
  protests with “goodwill”: There are people there of goodwill who want to
  change policies in relation to this country. But I would say to them be
  careful of the company you keep. I’ve seen some of the material for that
  particular protest and I’m really concerned about the anti-Indian sentiment
  that is being expressed and some of the antisemitic undertones of some of
  those protests. More from shadow-attorney general Julian Leeser who has been
  speaking to the ABC’s Insiders program. Sending the NZYQ cohort to Nauru is a
  “legitimate arrangement”, says Leeser, of a $400m deal struck between
  Australia and the Pacific nation to take hundreds of former immigration
  detainees. Leeser says it’s important that the group is repatriated to a third
  country, and it has exhausted all avenues of appeal to remain in Australia. He
  won’t confirm that the Coalition will support the legislation – but appears to
  be supportive of its goal: We are working through this legislation through our
  processes but I will say this: This cohort of people have had ample
  opportunities to put their case. They have exhausted all appeal avenues and
  the question now is whether they can be removed to another country. This is a
  legitimate arrangement. The only reason people can remain in Australia – and
  this is very well established under the migration law of this country – is if
  they have an Australian citizen or on a valid visa. Leeser says ‘ball is in
  Hamas’ court’ on Gaza On to the war in Gaza, David Speers asks Julian Leeser
  whether he has any criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in this
  conflict. The shadow attorney general – reiterating comments we’ve heard from
  the Coalition – says he’s distressed by the images coming out of Gaza but the
  “ball is in Hamas’ court” to release the hostages and end the war: Israel,
  like Australia, is a western liberal democratic country, the only democracy in
  the Middle East. It has free and fair elections. It has robust judiciary, it
  has freedom of the press, it respects the rights of women and LGBTQ
  minorities. Hamas, by contrast, is a terrorist organisation that we list as a
  terror organisation in this country. It is sponsored by Iran, the same Iran
  that launched attacks on Australia and Australians. Asked how he would
  describe the bombing of a hospital in Gaza, killing 20 people, including five
  journalists, Leeser calls it a “tragedy” and says it’s appropriate that Israel
  has said it will be investigated. Pointing fingers over terrorist listing The
  Coalition and government have been pointing fingers over when Iran’s Islamic
  Revolutionary Guard Corps should have been listed as a terrorist organisation.
  The opposition has blamed the Albanese government for not moving faster, when
  they were warned more than two years ago to do so. But the shadow defence
  spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, has also revealed that he was pushing for the
  listing during the previous Morrison government. ABC Insiders host, David
  Speers asks Julian Leeser what an earlier listing would have done – when the
  criminals who carried out the attacks didn’t know that the directives were
  coming from the IRGC: The fact that the terrorist organisation is being listed
  may well degrade its operations in a particular country and it says one
  shouldn’t associate with terrorist organisations because that itself becomes a
  crime and you shouldn’t accept finance from terrorist organisations. Leeser
  says the Persian community was pushing for the listing in 2023 and that a
  Senate committee was also doing work to look at the process of listing it.
  Asked why the Coalition government hadn’t done it, Leeser says the Morrison
  government had listed Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organisations. Federal
  opposition leader calls for calm before anti-immigration marches The federal
  opposition leader, Sussan Ley, also commented late yesterday on the
  anti-immigration marches planned for Sunday, calling for calm and respectful
  behaviour: In Australia, we protect the right to an opinion and the right to
  protest. But that must be done peacefully and respectfully. There is no place
  for violence, racism or intimidation. Whether incited from afar or stirred up
  here, we cannot let hatred and fear tear at our social cohesion. Strong
  borders keep us safe, but they also allow us to be generous and compassionate
  to those fleeing conflict. The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, has
  claimed the Albanese government’s position on Israel helped “create an
  atmosphere” for attacks on Jewish communities that have now been blamed on
  Iran. Leeser is appearing on the ABC’s Insiders program. Asked if he still
  blamed the government for the attacks that began in late 2024, he said: I
  think when you create a situation where you delegitimise the Jewish state
  which is what the government has been doing in relation to a series of votes
  at the United Nations, you delegitimise Jewish people here and you create an
  atmosphere where low-life criminals are prepared to take money from an
  organisation ultimately backed by the Iranian regime to commit crimes against
  Jewish people. He said the move to list the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps
  and expel the country’s ambassador was the right one “but it was the right
  move two and a half years too late”. New era for marathon With a finish line
  in front of the Sydney Opera House, the city’s marathon starts its life as an
  official Abbott World Marathon Major this morning, joining the likes of
  Boston, London and New York. Some 35,000 runners have joined the attempt to
  finish the 42km course this morning. There’s also a 10km run that set off at
  8.45am this morning. That’s a huge rise from the 5,300 who ran in 2022 and the
  25,000 who took part last year. How does it feel when you wake up on Sunday
  morning, bleary-eyed maybe, and realise thousands have already been out for a
  42km run? Ethiopian Hailemaryam Kiros Kebedew has crossed the finish line as
  the winner of the men’s race of the huge Sydney Marathon as the event enters
  its first year as a World Major. There were 35,000 runners registered. Dutch
  runner Sifan Hassan has just won the women’s race in a time of 2 hours, 18
  minutes and 22 seconds. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has used a
  speech on the eve of the March for Australia to condemn those who “walk with
  Nazis” and express concern about the anti-immigration protest. Allan, speaking
  at the premier’s annual multicultural gala on Saturday night, said even
  children who saw the march on the television news would know “it’s not a very
  Australian march at all” because “it just won’t look like the Australia they
  know”: Australia isn’t a place where we spread hate and fear about foreigners
  … Australia is a nation of foreigners. And Australia isn’t a place where we
  walk with Nazis … Australia is a place that went to war with Nazis. And the
  Australian flag is a symbol of our victory and their defeat. Allan said the
  flag was “a beautiful thing, but it’s what you do with it that counts”: Make
  no mistake – I am concerned about tomorrow’s march … but I’m not afraid. We
  should look out for one another … but we should not be scared. No one who has
  ever tried to divide this country has ever succeeded. Because the promise of
  multiculturalism is so much stronger. Good morning and it’s a welcome from me,
  Graham Readfearn, to our live news blog for this Sunday. The search for Dezi
  Freeman, the alleged killer of two Victorian police officers, enters its sixth
  day. Police arrested a 61-year-old man late yesterday in nearby Bright, but
  have not confirmed if the arrest is linked to the search for Freeman. We will
  also be keeping an eye on planned anti-immigration marches that are due to
  take place around lunchtime in all the capital cities. There are already
  thousands of people out in Sydney’s CBD this morning, with several road
  closures, as the city hosts what is expected to be its biggest marathon yet,
  with 35,000 runners registered.

Anti-immigration rallies and marches are under way Anti-immigration marches and rallies are getting under way now across Australia. A livestream on the Instagram account of Free Palestine Melbourne – a group part of a counter rally in the city – is showing large crowds and constant and sometimes angry chanting, with a heavy police presence. So far it appears the police have kept the opposing groups well apart. Here is the full statement from Amalia Freeman, the wife of Dezi Freeman, who is currently on the run from police after allegedly shooting dead two police officers. On behalf of my children and myself, I wish to share our deep sorrow for the loss of the lives of Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart on 26 August 2025. We are truly sorry for your loss, and the suffering and grief that the families, friends and colleagues of Detective Leading Senior Constable Thompson and Senior Constable De Waart are now experiencing. My children and I grieve for the loss of your loved ones. My children and I respect the important work of Victoria Police and do not hold anti-authority views. We echo the requests of the Victoria Police for the swift and safe conclusion of this tragedy. I lend my full support to Victoria Police in their search for my husband and will co-operate with Victoria Police in any way that I can. Please Dezi, if you see or hear this, call 000 and arrange a surrender plan with the police. If anyone is harbouring, helping or supporting Dezi, please call 000 immediately and speak with the police. If anyone has seen Dezi or knows anything that may help the police to understand his whereabouts, even if it is just a snippet of information, please call 000 immediately. The wife of Dezi Freeman – the man accused of shooting dead two Victorian police officers – has pleaded with him to surrender in a statement provided to the ABC. Police have started the sixth day of the search for Freeman who is accused of killing two Victorian police officers. According to the ABC, Freeman’s wife, Amalia Freeman, said she had “deep sorrow” for the deaths of the two officers. The statement said: On behalf of my children and myself, I wish to share our deep sorrow for the loss of the lives of the detective leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim de Waart. We are truly sorry for your loss and the suffering and grief that the families, friends and colleagues of the men are now experiencing. My children and I respect the important work of Victoria Police and do not hold anti-authoritarian views. The ABC said the statement had echoed the requests of Victoria police for “a swift and safe conclusion to this tragedy.” The statement added: I lend my full support to Victoria Police in their search for my husband and will co-operate with Victoria Police in any way that I can. Please Dezi, if you see or hear this, call 000 and arrange a surrender plan with the police. Melbourne anti-immigration rally starts More here from our reporter Stephanie Convery who is in Melbourne at the scene of one of the anti-immigration marches taking place across the country. Police are trying to keep opposing groups apart. The anti-immigration rally at Flinders Street intersection was supposed to start at 12pm but it was full of Australian flags by 11.30, and chants of “Aussie Aussie Aussie, oi oi oi”. A few placards: one reads “Mass immigration = silent invasion”. Police have blocked off Flinders St and Swanston St to the north of the intersection, which seems designed to keep two rallies apart. There’s a man on a loudspeaker who is addressing his remarks directly to the police. It’s hard to hear what he’s saying but it seems to include something “in the name of the king”, which suggests pseudolaw rhetoric. A second antifascist counter-demonstration has already established itself at the intersection of Swanston Street and Flinders Lane, and are chanting while being pushed back, away from the anti-immigration rally by a line of police on horseback. The mood is already quite volatile. I’ve just seen police push at least two protesters to the ground as they move them back. Pro-Palestine and antifascist groups gather in Melbourne ahead of anti-immigration march I’m out the front of the State Library of Victoria where hundreds of people have gathered to protest against the far right and show solidarity with Palestine. This weekend, the regular pro-Palestine rally has met earlier than usual and merged with an antifascist counter-demonstration to protest against the anti-immigration March for Australia, which is gathering at the Flinders Street station intersection. The northernmost end of St Kilda Road from the National Gallery of Victoria and Queens Bridge has been blocked off since earlier this morning, and a large police presence established around and throughout Flinders Street station itself. There are marches planned across Australia today, including at all the state capitals, many scheduled to start at noon. March organisers say there are more than 20 protests planned today. Two stabbed in home invasion in ‘mistaken identity’ case in Sydney’s west Police in Sydney’s south-west have reported a home invasion last night where a man and a woman were stabbed by two men who entered their home wearing face coverings, in what officers think was a case of mistaken identity. Emergency services were called to a house at McCredie Road in Guildford West at 11pm last night and police established a crime scene. NSW police say the two men fled the scene when neighbours intervened. Three children under 10 were also in the home but were not injured. A 41-year-old man and 37-year-old woman living at the home were taken to hospital in a stable condition. Police said the alleged invaders were seen getting in to a white sedan parked out the front of the home that was driven by a third person south along Lomond Street. Police have asked anyone with information or who were in the area at the time with any available dashcam or mobile phone footage to contact Granville police station or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. South Australia in world-first ban of fish-shaped soy sauce containers They’re called shoyu-tai – the tiny fish-shaped soy sauce containers that have been a staple of sushi take-away joints for years. But from tomorrow, they will be banned in South Australia in a world-first step. My colleague Eelemarni Close-Brown has this story. Police in Victoria looking for Dezi Freeman – the “sovereign citizen” who allegedly shot two police officers – say there have been several reported sightings of him. The search for Freeman has started its sixth day this morning with hundreds of officers searching the bush around the town of Porepunkah. Victoria police’s chief commissioner, Mike Bush, said none of the sightings had been confirmed as Freeman. Police have charged a 61-year-old man arrested yesterday with possessing an imitation firearm and possessing cannabis, alleging the items were from the house they found him in. Whether the man was associated with Freeman was part of inquiries, police said. Asked about the planned anti-immigration protests across Australia today, Julian Leeser says he’s concerned about some of the anti-Indian and antisemitic sentiment being expressed. But he also adds that there are people who will be attending these protests with “goodwill”: There are people there of goodwill who want to change policies in relation to this country. But I would say to them be careful of the company you keep. I’ve seen some of the material for that particular protest and I’m really concerned about the anti-Indian sentiment that is being expressed and some of the antisemitic undertones of some of those protests. More from shadow-attorney general Julian Leeser who has been speaking to the ABC’s Insiders program. Sending the NZYQ cohort to Nauru is a “legitimate arrangement”, says Leeser, of a $400m deal struck between Australia and the Pacific nation to take hundreds of former immigration detainees. Leeser says it’s important that the group is repatriated to a third country, and it has exhausted all avenues of appeal to remain in Australia. He won’t confirm that the Coalition will support the legislation – but appears to be supportive of its goal: We are working through this legislation through our processes but I will say this: This cohort of people have had ample opportunities to put their case. They have exhausted all appeal avenues and the question now is whether they can be removed to another country. This is a legitimate arrangement. The only reason people can remain in Australia – and this is very well established under the migration law of this country – is if they have an Australian citizen or on a valid visa. Leeser says ‘ball is in Hamas’ court’ on Gaza On to the war in Gaza, David Speers asks Julian Leeser whether he has any criticism of the way Israel has conducted itself in this conflict. The shadow attorney general – reiterating comments we’ve heard from the Coalition – says he’s distressed by the images coming out of Gaza but the “ball is in Hamas’ court” to release the hostages and end the war: Israel, like Australia, is a western liberal democratic country, the only democracy in the Middle East. It has free and fair elections. It has robust judiciary, it has freedom of the press, it respects the rights of women and LGBTQ minorities. Hamas, by contrast, is a terrorist organisation that we list as a terror organisation in this country. It is sponsored by Iran, the same Iran that launched attacks on Australia and Australians. Asked how he would describe the bombing of a hospital in Gaza, killing 20 people, including five journalists, Leeser calls it a “tragedy” and says it’s appropriate that Israel has said it will be investigated. Pointing fingers over terrorist listing The Coalition and government have been pointing fingers over when Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should have been listed as a terrorist organisation. The opposition has blamed the Albanese government for not moving faster, when they were warned more than two years ago to do so. But the shadow defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, has also revealed that he was pushing for the listing during the previous Morrison government. ABC Insiders host, David Speers asks Julian Leeser what an earlier listing would have done – when the criminals who carried out the attacks didn’t know that the directives were coming from the IRGC: The fact that the terrorist organisation is being listed may well degrade its operations in a particular country and it says one shouldn’t associate with terrorist organisations because that itself becomes a crime and you shouldn’t accept finance from terrorist organisations. Leeser says the Persian community was pushing for the listing in 2023 and that a Senate committee was also doing work to look at the process of listing it. Asked why the Coalition government hadn’t done it, Leeser says the Morrison government had listed Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organisations. Federal opposition leader calls for calm before anti-immigration marches The federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, also commented late yesterday on the anti-immigration marches planned for Sunday, calling for calm and respectful behaviour: In Australia, we protect the right to an opinion and the right to protest. But that must be done peacefully and respectfully. There is no place for violence, racism or intimidation. Whether incited from afar or stirred up here, we cannot let hatred and fear tear at our social cohesion. Strong borders keep us safe, but they also allow us to be generous and compassionate to those fleeing conflict. The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, has claimed the Albanese government’s position on Israel helped “create an atmosphere” for attacks on Jewish communities that have now been blamed on Iran. Leeser is appearing on the ABC’s Insiders program. Asked if he still blamed the government for the attacks that began in late 2024, he said: I think when you create a situation where you delegitimise the Jewish state which is what the government has been doing in relation to a series of votes at the United Nations, you delegitimise Jewish people here and you create an atmosphere where low-life criminals are prepared to take money from an organisation ultimately backed by the Iranian regime to commit crimes against Jewish people. He said the move to list the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and expel the country’s ambassador was the right one “but it was the right move two and a half years too late”. New era for marathon With a finish line in front of the Sydney Opera House, the city’s marathon starts its life as an official Abbott World Marathon Major this morning, joining the likes of Boston, London and New York. Some 35,000 runners have joined the attempt to finish the 42km course this morning. There’s also a 10km run that set off at 8.45am this morning. That’s a huge rise from the 5,300 who ran in 2022 and the 25,000 who took part last year. How does it feel when you wake up on Sunday morning, bleary-eyed maybe, and realise thousands have already been out for a 42km run? Ethiopian Hailemaryam Kiros Kebedew has crossed the finish line as the winner of the men’s race of the huge Sydney Marathon as the event enters its first year as a World Major. There were 35,000 runners registered. Dutch runner Sifan Hassan has just won the women’s race in a time of 2 hours, 18 minutes and 22 seconds. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has used a speech on the eve of the March for Australia to condemn those who “walk with Nazis” and express concern about the anti-immigration protest. Allan, speaking at the premier’s annual multicultural gala on Saturday night, said even children who saw the march on the television news would know “it’s not a very Australian march at all” because “it just won’t look like the Australia they know”: Australia isn’t a place where we spread hate and fear about foreigners … Australia is a nation of foreigners. And Australia isn’t a place where we walk with Nazis … Australia is a place that went to war with Nazis. And the Australian flag is a symbol of our victory and their defeat. Allan said the flag was “a beautiful thing, but it’s what you do with it that counts”: Make no mistake – I am concerned about tomorrow’s march … but I’m not afraid. We should look out for one another … but we should not be scared. No one who has ever tried to divide this country has ever succeeded. Because the promise of multiculturalism is so much stronger. Good morning and it’s a welcome from me, Graham Readfearn, to our live news blog for this Sunday. The search for Dezi Freeman, the alleged killer of two Victorian police officers, enters its sixth day. Police arrested a 61-year-old man late yesterday in nearby Bright, but have not confirmed if the arrest is linked to the search for Freeman. We will also be keeping an eye on planned anti-immigration marches that are due to take place around lunchtime in all the capital cities. There are already thousands of people out in Sydney’s CBD this morning, with several road closures, as the city hosts what is expected to be its biggest marathon yet, with 35,000 runners registered.
