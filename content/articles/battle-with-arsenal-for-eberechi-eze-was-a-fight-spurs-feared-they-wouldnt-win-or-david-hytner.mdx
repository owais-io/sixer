  It was towards the end of June when it became clear that Tottenham were
  considering a move for Eberechi Eze, one to install him as the centrepiece of
  their new project under Thomas Frank. Or, at least, when it became public
  knowledge. And it was the prompt for two things to happen. Firstly, it would
  be reported a few days later that Arsenal were also on the case. The club’s
  new sporting director, Andrea Berta, had put the feelers out for the Crystal
  Palace forward. Call it a declaration of interest, albeit Berta was having a
  lot of conversations about a lot of potential targets at the time. His idea
  was to have plenty of options on the boil before deciding which to prioritise.
  Then, there was a subtle change to the mood music at Spurs, a kind of step
  back into a holding pattern. Agent talk, was the word inside the club. Eze was
  more likely to stay at Palace. It would be wrong to get too far ahead of
  anything on this one. But it was impossible to ignore the alternative reading:
  Spurs did not want to be drawn into a battle with their rivals over one of the
  most exciting talents on the market. Spurs were fearful of that, and for good
  reason. They had to know that, given the choice, Eze would go for Arsenal over
  them. There were the emotional reasons. He had supported Arsenal as a kid and
  played in their academy until his release as a 13-year-old; the line about how
  he cried for a week afterwards is a well-known part of his story. Yet it would
  not only be about dreams and unfinished business. Eze would surely look at the
  Premier League table from last season. At which club would he stand the better
  chance of winning the title? At this point it is worth introducing Mikel
  Arteta, who let it be known just how highly he rated Eze and how perfectly he
  would fit into his team. Eze’s head was turned. So Spurs entered territory in
  which the reward was tantalising, almost irresistible, but the risk was
  extreme. It was as if they were shadow boxing with Arsenal, their every move
  over Eze likely to come right back at them. Arsenal were a devil on their
  shoulder; watching, waiting. Spurs would pivot to Morgan Gibbs-White in July
  only to run into the immovable object that is Evangelos Marinakis. No deal,
  the Nottingham Forest owner said. There would be a new one for Gibbs-White at
  Forest and, sadly for Spurs, egg on their face after they believed they would
  be able to exploit a £60m release clause in his old contract. The Gibbs-White
  episode has been a climate-shaper in Spurs’s summer and then there was the
  moment when James Maddison ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in the
  pre-season game against Newcastle on 3 August; a shattering blow for him and
  Spurs. Dejan Kulusevski, the club’s other key central attacking midfielder,
  had knee surgery in May and is out until around the turn of the year, so the
  need to act in the market was obvious and urgent. Why not move straight away
  for Eze; give him and Palace a decision to make by meeting the £68m release
  clause in his deal, which was in place until 15 August? Spurs’s hesitation was
  to do with the fact they considered the number to be too high for a
  27-year-old with 12 England caps and no experience of European football at
  club level. It is not the only detail in terms of optics that has hurt them as
  Arsenal prepare to pay pretty much that amount to take Eze to the Emirates,
  with Spurs themselves having ended up ready to do likewise. There has been the
  idea that Spurs had a clear run at Eze because Arsenal, after spending around
  £200m on six other signings, would need to raise money via sales before they
  could make a bid. Well, they have sold nobody and still pushed the button.
  Unless Arsenal have a sale or two lined up, could it be that they have more
  financial headroom than they have let on? It is easy to pick over the
  curiosities. Eze is represented by CAA Base, the influential firm of agents
  who have close links to Spurs. Should that have given Spurs an edge? It must
  be said that Base will always put the wishes of their players first. And why
  did it seemingly take Kai Havertz feeling a knee injury after Sunday’s win at
  Manchester United for Arsenal to move on Eze? There are similarities in the
  profile of both players but there is a fundamental difference: Havertz can
  play as a No 9, Eze cannot. With Gabriel Jesus a long-term injury casualty,
  the loss of Havertz ought to have led Arsenal to look for a No 9 to provide
  support for the new signing, Viktor Gyökeres. Not take Eze. The reality is
  that Spurs were never going to win this fight. We will never know what would
  have happened if they had offered to pay Eze’s release clause. But it feels
  fair to assume that it would have led Arsenal into following suit. Spurs
  eventually reached an agreement with Palace on Wednesday and they believed
  they had one with Eze, too. If Arsenal were not an option, Eze would have
  joined Spurs. At this stage of his career, after giving everything for Palace
  across five seasons, he is ready for a change; the chance to play in the
  Champions League. But Arsenal were an option; they never went away. It took
  them a matter of hours to slide in for the steal. The bad news for Spurs is
  that the very thing they feared has come to pass. The memes are out, an Eze
  mural has appeared in the tunnel outside the Emirates and the time is tighter
  to provide Frank with a new No 10. Have Spurs built on the momentum of their
  Europa League triumph from last season? They have added João Paulinha and
  Mohammed Kudus for the starting XI, while it was a tonic to tie the new
  captain, Cristian Romero, to a long-term contract. But when their supporters
  look around, they see that Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal
  have spent £200m or significantly upwards on signings. Manchester City,
  meanwhile, have invested £150m. The mood at Tottenham is back to being edgy.
  Arsenal have made a statement of intent.
