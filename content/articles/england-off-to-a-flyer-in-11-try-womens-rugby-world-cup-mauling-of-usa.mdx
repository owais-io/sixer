  Outside chatter of a Rugby World Cup favourites tag and expectations on a team
  can only go so far, the Red Roses had to go out and prove it on the pitch. The
  host nation more than lived up to their hype as they kicked off their campaign
  in front of a record crowd for an opening game at a women’s World Cup with a
  hugely dominant display against the USA which has underlined their ambitions
  for the World Cup crown. The prop Hannah Botterman and the centre Megan Jones
  were standouts in a good team display and the scary thought for their future
  opponents is that the performance was far from England’s best. Handling errors
  were at the heart of the sloppy areas for the Red Roses but the hosts were
  commanding at scrum time which got them out of jail on a few occasions. When
  their attack did click nothing could stop them, the best try of the 11 coming
  with Botterman’s clever line run in the first half. But before a ball was
  thrown, the city of Sunderland had been buzzing all day in the buildup.
  Heading to the stadium there were USA fans in hot dog outfits, while England
  supporters donned scarves and cowboy hats. The hats are becoming synonymous
  with the Red Roses thanks to Ellie Kildunne and Jones’s try celebration which
  the 42,723 fans had to wait until the 35th minute to see, as Kildunne scored
  her first try. There was a showbiz start with the opening ceremony including
  pop star Anne-Marie but it was clear who the rugby superstar was with a huge
  cheer for Ilona Maher, the USA outside centre and the most followed rugby
  player on social media, when the teams were announced but England’s Kildunne
  also registered deafening applause. It was a cagey opening few minutes with
  both teams’ first attacks thwarted. England found their opportunity through a
  scrum penalty with the first set-piece punch thrown by the hosts and a simple
  catch and drive was executed to make the openside flanker Sadia Kabeya the
  first try-scorer of this World Cup. The next try was a piece of rugby
  brilliance. Jones picked a cross-field kick which Abby Dow managed to recover
  and recycle, Botterman ran an expert line to splice the defence open and the
  huge roar from the prop which followed showed what it meant. With England in
  the driving seat every small win the USA gained, if it was disrupting a
  lineout or winning a breakdown penalty, they celebrated wildly. Maher had said
  in a pre-match conference that the USA can be their “own worst enemies” at
  times and that was definitely the case in this Pool A match. Miscommunication
  between USA captain Kate Zackary and the wing Bulou Mataitoga led to a sure
  try being fumbled but a piece of individual skill by Erica Jarrell shortly
  after put the USA on the board. The fly-half McKenzie Hawkins’ conversion
  counted but she cut it close, with the hooter from the countdown sounding just
  after her kick attempt. The USA then took another hit with Alev Kelter sent to
  the sin-bin for cynical play. England took advantage of being a player up
  after Maud Muir powered over the line despite resolute defence from the USA.
  The stadium came to life next with supporters on their feet as Dow broke down
  the right before feeding back inside to Kildunne. England were cooking and not
  just in attack as they held up a try at the other end of the pitch just before
  half-time. The momentum was firmly England’s but it seemed the Red Roses
  wanted more from their performance with the leadership group, including
  captain Zoe Aldcroft and vice-captain Natasha Hunt, remaining on the pitch for
  a few minutes before heading into the changing room. Dow found the try line to
  open the second half scoring with a Jones charge down resulting in an
  excellent finish from Kildunne a few phases later. The USA could not get a
  look in with Botterman coming up with a breakdown penalty which then resulted
  in the hooker Amy Cokayne crashing over. Very aptly the song to play in
  celebration was I Just Can’t Get Enough by Depeche Mode and the Red Roses
  couldn’t with the wing Jess Breach next over. England continued to be
  relentless with replacement hooker Lark Atkin-Davies over and then Emily
  Scarratt entered the pitch for her fifth Rugby World Cup, becoming the first
  England player to reach that many. Scarratt, who won the World Cup in 2014 and
  made her first appearance at the tournament in the home 2010 competition, took
  over kicking duties after replacing Zoe Harrison but missed her kick when
  Breach crashed over for her second try. The scoring was rounded off by
  Atkin-Davies to complete the Red Roses’ 28th consecutive win. The Red Roses
  machine is moving and it looks deadly in their pursuit of the trophy they
  haven’t won since 2014. Next up for England is Samoa, while the USA face
  Australia in what is now a must-win game in their own Rugby World Cup
  campaign. • The caption to the third photo in this article was amended on 23
  August 2025. It shows Natasha Hunt, not Abby Dow, celebrating with Ellie
  Kildunne.
