  British &amp; Irish Lions executives have insisted future tours are not under
  threat from the breakaway R360 league despite being ignored by the rebels. The
  proposed R360 calendar would appear to squeeze the Lions but, after a first
  series win in 12 years, the chief executive, Ben Calveley, believes future
  tours are secure. Calveley also revealed that talks are progressing well with
  New Zealand over the 2029 tour and, after guiding the Lions to a first series
  win since 2013, Andy Farrell is in pole position to continue as head coach in
  four years’ time. He also admitted that “home” fixtures – such as the game
  staged in Dublin against Argentina in June – are to become a regular staple
  and wants tour matches against other nations such as Fiji and Japan to replace
  some provincial fixtures after the Lions were rarely tested by Australia’s
  Super Rugby sides. As the Lions were plotting – and failing – to wrap up a
  series clean sweep in Sydney last week, a number of meetings were held between
  rugby’s powerbrokers. It is understood that at a World Rugby meeting R360
  featured highly on the agenda with the competition planning to launch in
  September 2026. The breakaway league intends to hold its fixtures from April
  to October, pausing in July for the international window. Ten-match Lions
  tours require using a larger international window every four years, however,
  and at present organisers have approval from World Rugby to do so. “We haven’t
  had any formal discussions at all with R360 so I can’t comment in any detail
  on their proposition and their proposal,” Calveley said. “What I can say, and
  you have seen these quotes come from players at every stage throughout the
  tour, is that they remain absolutely committed to the Lions. We all know that
  we have our place in the calendar baked into [World Rugby’s] regulation 9 and
  I wouldn’t see that changing in the future. “It’s up to them who they want to
  make contact with. I don’t really want to comment on how they manage their own
  business. For me, what is encouraging is that our players remain committed to
  the Lions. I think we have seen on this tour just what it means, not just to
  them but to the fans and the whole of the game. We are very confident that our
  position in the future is secure.” The Lions were scheduled to fly home on
  Sunday night after failing to wrap up a 3-0 series victory, going down 22-12
  in Sydney. Having secured the series, however, Farrell all but confirmed his
  interest in resuming the job in four years and Calveley gave the Ireland head
  coach a glowing endorsement. “He has done a great job and I have really
  enjoyed working with him,” he said. “When it comes to our appointments for
  future tours, we will start the process in about two years and I don’t think
  it would be right to comment on where it ends up, let’s see. But he has put
  himself in a very strong position hasn’t he, let’s put it that way.” The match
  on Saturday was delayed by 38 minutes because of lightning in the surrounding
  area and while TV viewers got a glimpse inside the changing rooms, with Bundee
  Aki pictured on an exercise bike and Finn Russell shown scrolling through his
  phone, the Lions’ performance director, David Nucifora, soon put a towel over
  the camera. He has been criticised for doing so but the Lions have insisted
  that they met tour regulations regarding TV access into their dressing room
  and defended their actions on the grounds that tactics might have been
  exposed. “It’s a balance,” Calveley said. “There are certain things that you
  do have to protect. But, at the same time, we want to be as open as we can. We
  want to be accessible and bring fans behind the curtain.” Calveley also
  confirmed that the 2029 tour of New Zealand is to include nine matches again
  as well as another warm-up game with France as a leading candidate to be the
  opposition, either in the UK or in the US. France has been mooted as a
  possible tour destination although Calveley insisted the Lions would be going
  back to Australia. “If you look at the different elements of the tour, you
  have the pre‑tour, the equivalent of the Argentina game in Dublin, you then
  have the tour matches and the Test matches. Leave the Tests alone. You are not
  going to do anything with those. We are really keen in doing more in the
  pre-tour element. “You might bring different countries into that space. And
  then you could do the same with the tour matches. Would we be interested in
  bringing in, for example, a Fiji or a Japan? And you can think of other
  countries as well. Yes we would. That is a conversation we will have with New
  Zealand rugby to see if that is possible. “I would absolutely envisage
  returning to Australia. Just to be very clear, I know there’s been loads of
  speculation about whether that would be the case or not, but we’ve had a
  wonderful tour here, and it is 100% our ambition to return, and we would want
  the next one to be bigger and better than this one. “Who knows what the
  calendar looks like in the future. If nothing changes in terms of calendar
  configurations and so forth, then [2037] would be the expectation, yes.”
