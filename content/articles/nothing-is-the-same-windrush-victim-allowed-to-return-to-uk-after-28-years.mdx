  When George Lee was last in the UK, Tony Blair was the newly elected prime
  minister, Diana, Princess of Wales had recently died and Elton John’s Candle
  in the Wind was being played on repeat. A pint of bitter cost £1.63 and a
  packet of 20 cigarettes sold for about £2.94. After 28 years of exile in
  Poland, Lee, an English teacher, flew back to Britain a fortnight ago, his
  ticket paid for by the Home Office, where staff had belatedly acknowledged he
  was a victim of the Windrush scandal and allowed him to return. He first
  contacted MPs and Home Office workers to request assistance in summer 2018 as
  the Windrush scandal unfolded. He says consular officials in Poland and Home
  Office staff in the UK failed to help him return despite the government’s
  repeated proclamations that everything was being done to assist those
  affected. Currently accommodated in a hotel room in Birmingham, Lee travelled
  to London last week, stepping off the train at Euston station into a city so
  transformed in the past three decades that he was instantly overwhelmed by
  culture shock. “Nothing is the same – the taxis are different, the buses are
  different,” he said, as he made his way into the underground, puzzled by the
  Oyster card system. “What do I do with this? Tap and go through?” He has spent
  the last two weeks walking around the streets, attempting to reacclimatise to
  the country he moved to from Jamaica in 1961 as an eight-year-old, assessing
  why he does not yet feel at home, despite the 37 years he lived here before
  being locked out. He is relieved to be back, but startled by the intense sense
  of dislocation after so long away. “So much has changed. The homelessness is
  horrible – much worse than in Poland,” he said. “People here look so stressed,
  there’s a tiredness etched on their faces, as if they don’t know what to
  expect of tomorrow. It’s a little depressing. It’s clear that the quality of
  life is better in Poland than here, which feels very sad.” Lee, 72, is one of
  a number of victims of the Windrush scandal who were prevented from returning
  to Britain after travelling abroad for work, or holiday or funerals; some were
  stopped by local border staff; many were given no assistance by UK consular
  officials who refused to acknowledge their right to travel to the UK. Lee says
  he struggled to persuade Home Office staff, MPs and officials at the UK
  consulate in Poland that he should be given help to return home, despite
  repeated appeals for assistance. It was only last November when he contacted
  Desmond Jaddoo, a Windrush campaigner and Birmingham-based bishop who runs the
  Windrush National Organisation support group, that Lee was able to collect the
  documentary evidence needed to demonstrate that he should be allowed to
  return. “His case was a straightforward one, so it was easy to get him back
  once the documents were gathered,” Jaddoo said, adding that he was puzzled by
  why Lee had not received help to return sooner. Jaddoo traced school records,
  a marriage certificate, and Lee’s son’s birth certificate, proving he had a
  right to live in the UK. “We worry that there are other cases like this. We
  need a proper campaign to encourage people who remain stuck abroad to come
  forward.” Lee moved to London in 1961, the year before Jamaican independence,
  travelling with his younger brother on his aunt’s passport, to join his mother
  who was working as a nurse in east London, and his plumber father who was
  working on the North Sea oil pipelines. On arrival he would have been
  classified as a citizen of the UK and Colonies. He went to Princess May
  primary school in north London, where he passed the 11-plus and transferred to
  Dame Alice Owen’s grammar school. He worked as a financial analyst in the City
  of London for a while, opened his own barbershop, before later deciding that
  teaching was his vocation. He married and had a son, but by the time he went
  to take up a teaching job in Poland the marriage had ended. He travelled to
  Warsaw on a Jamaican passport because he had failed to persuade UK officials
  that he was entitled to a British passport, despite having arrived in the
  country 37 years earlier. Because he stayed slightly over two years, he
  inadvertently breached the terms of his immigration status as someone who had
  been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He was advised by staff at
  the Polish border that he would not be readmitted to the UK. Lee argued that
  he should have been recognised as a British citizen, because that was his
  status when he arrived as an eight-year-old. Throughout his time in Poland he
  was undocumented, which meant it was impossible to open a bank account. He
  taught English to hundreds of students. In one of the many emails he addressed
  to the Home Office in 2018, he noted that he had helped many Polish students
  pass exams to study at UK universities, and had at least 10 ex-students who
  now held PhDs from British institutions. “Can you imagine how it feels
  preparing all these people to go to the UK, when I, as a citizen of the UK,
  cannot even enter. Believe me it is soul-destroying,” he wrote. Lee made
  contact with the Windrush taskforce, which was set up as a result of the
  scandal in 2018, with a view to securing the necessary documentation to return
  to Britain, and explained he wanted help from the British embassy in Warsaw.
  When he went there to seek advice, a Polish employee was sent to speak to him
  on the pavement outside. “They refused to let me inside the building,” Lee
  said. During his time abroad he lost touch with his son and two sisters. He
  hopes to track them down and re-establish contact, but feels nervous about
  reconnecting. “I wonder if, during all the years I’ve been away, they have
  thought I abandoned them,” he said. In the next few weeks he needs to find
  somewhere permanent to live, reregister with a doctor and sort out his
  pension. He is dismayed that officials are refusing to grant back payments of
  his state pension going back to 2018, when he turned 65. The barrister Martin
  Forde KC, who served as the independent adviser to the Windrush compensation
  scheme from 2018 to 2022, working to recompense those affected by the scandal
  that led to thousands of people who were living in the UK legally being
  misclassified as immigration offenders with catastrophic consequences for
  many. Some people lost their jobs or were evicted from their homes, or were
  denied benefits, free healthcare, and pensions; a few were arrested and
  deported to countries they had left decades earlier as children. Others were
  stuck for years abroad. Forde said Lee should be granted pension payments,
  adding: “It seems inequitable not to give him the pension that he would
  otherwise have received.” When he feels more settled, Lee plans to visit the
  graves of his mother and younger brother in London, and revisit the London
  cinemas where he developed a love of French arthouse film. He is not ready to
  apply for compensation from the government because he does not believe
  ministers have acknowledged that immigration legislation which remains in
  place caused many of the Windrush generation’s problems. A long-buried Home
  Office-commissioned history into the roots of the scandal, finally released
  last year, warned that “during the period 1950-1981, every single piece of
  immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce
  the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and
  work in the UK”. “How can I claim compensation when they haven’t admitted that
  the legislation was wrong?” Lee said. “I don’t feel angry, I’m past the stage
  where I can feel angry. I’m very philosophical and thoughtful about all that’s
  happened. But I do feel deep regret that the UK government conspired to take
  away the rights of the Windrush generation.” Clive Foster, who was appointed
  as the new Windrush commissioner in July, said he wanted the government to do
  more to “proactively identify and reach individuals” still stranded abroad.
  The problem stretches “far beyond the Caribbean, affecting communities across
  Africa, Asia, and the wider Commonwealth. Yet people from these communities,
  in the UK and overseas, may be unaware that the injustices they’ve suffered
  are directly linked to this scandal.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are
  doing our best to ensure that justice and compensation for victims is
  delivered as quickly as possible. Some cases are more complex than others, but
  we will always try to work with each individual to get them the support they
  need.”
