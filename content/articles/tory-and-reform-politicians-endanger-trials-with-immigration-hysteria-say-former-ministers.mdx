  Tory and Reform politicians endanger trials with immigration ‘hysteria’, say
  former ministers

  Conservative and Reform UK politicians are fuelling “hysteria and anger” over
  immigration, with criminal trials put at risk of collapse, former ministers
  and police have warned. Protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers have
  spread across the country in recent weeks, while debate about immigration –
  including instances of misinformation – has intensified. At a Reform press
  conference on Monday, a man awaiting trial was referred to as “the criminal”
  by a Reform council leader despite not yet being convicted of any crime.
  Questioned on whether contempt laws had been broken, the party’s leader, Nigel
  Farage, said it was “good” that the council leader had become “slightly
  emotional”. Amid growing pressure, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said on
  Tuesday that she had asked for a change in official guidance to permit police
  to release the ethnicity or immigration status of criminal suspects. Dominic
  Grieve, a former Conservative attorney general, told the Guardian he was
  concerned about the “fuelling of hysteria by politicians” and said some were
  breaking the law by commenting on future trials in serious cases such as rape
  and abduction. Certain politicians “seem to have thrown the rulebook in the
  bonfire”, he said. Britain’s former top counter-terrorism chief warned that
  comments from Farage and the Tory shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick,
  risked “unwittingly” inciting violence, accusing them of copying Donald
  Trump’s techniques by hyping fears over immigration to try to win votes. Neil
  Basu, a former assistant commissioner with the Metropolitan police, said it
  was “appealing to the worst kind of populist sentiment”. Asked if such
  rhetoric risks contributing to a risk of last summer’s violence, Basu said:
  “Yes … they should be very careful about the language they use. It is capable,
  demonstrably, of causing violence.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey,
  said it was time for the attorney general, Richard Hermer, to issue a formal
  warning to Farage about comments on live criminal cases. “Farage and the
  Conservatives are … openly trying to tear down our justice system, just as the
  Maga movement has done in the US,” Davey said. “Irresponsible comments like
  these put prosecutions at risk and could let dangerous criminals walk free.
  The attorney general must step in and send a formal warning to Farage that
  contempt of court will not be tolerated.” Others who appealed for a change in
  tone included the former justice secretaries Robert Buckland, David Gauke and
  Charlie Falconer, as well as the former chair of the justice select committee,
  Sir Bob Neill, who said they were worried about the febrile environment –
  though several said more transparency from police over the ethnicity of
  suspects was also now necessary to calm tensions. The row over information
  withheld by police has been reignited after the 19-year-old Reform leader of
  Warwickshire county council, George Finch, said police were refusing to
  confirm details of two suspects charged after an alleged rape. Among other
  examples cited by critics was data used by Jenrick that 40% of all of the
  sexual crimes were committed by foreign nationals last year. The number of
  convictions is significantly lower. Grieve said he was extremely concerned
  about the consequence of the frenzied atmosphere on contempt of court laws,
  also citing the trial of two British Pakistani men over a police assault at
  Manchester airport. “With social media, contempt of court has gone out of the
  window,” he said. “It seems to be that it’s a complete free for all, and for
  politicians who ought to know better to participate in this is actually
  scandalous. Certainly with some of the recent cases, politicians seem to have
  thrown the rulebook in the bonfire.” Buckland said he had supported changes to
  make the nationality of offenders publicly available, but he was concerned
  about the potential for misinformation. “Politicians have a responsibility to
  use objective and tested data rather than distorted or incomplete
  information,” he said. Neill, a former Tory MP, said he was in favour of more
  transparency but alarmed at the willingness of politicians to risk undermining
  the courts. “I’m afraid some people, including people in elected office,
  frankly do not understand the importance of the checks and balances in our
  system, which includes protecting the jury system,” he said. The former Labour
  justice secretary Charlie Falconer said: “The opposition feel the need the
  whole time to get headlines by constantly describing things in an extremist
  way, all the time it’s saying, ‘society will be on the verge of collapse
  unless something is done,’” he said. “The language is much, much worse than it
  ever was five years ago. There’s a more angry electorate, and there’s too many
  politicians willing to use lurid language.” A Home Office source said it was
  vital that there was “greater clarity on how contempt of court laws work
  alongside social media and today’s communication environment”, but stopped
  short of issuing warnings to politicians. Hermer has so far declined to
  intervene to warn politicians on the risks of potentially collapsing criminal
  trials. In a sign of how far misinformation has spread, polling from YouGov
  found the British public “dramatically overestimate” the number of illegal
  migrants to the UK. Almost half of Britons – 47% – think there are more
  migrants staying in the UK illegally rather than legally, including about a
  third who believe it is “much higher”. There are varied estimates of the
  numbers of those living in the UK without formal status, which is difficult to
  calculate, but the Migration Observatory’s most recent figures said it was up
  to 1.3 million. But legal migration is far higher – about 10.7 million people
  in the UK were born in a different country. Attitudes to migration have
  significantly hardened. About 45% of Britons say they would support “admitting
  no more new migrants, and requiring large numbers of migrants who came to the
  UK in recent years to leave”. Rights groups including Amnesty International
  have cautioned against releasing suspects’ ethnicities, accusing the
  government of “choosing to pour fuel on the fire of dangerous narratives,
  instead of taking action to address racism and hostility”. Cooper said the
  government had asked the Law Commission to review the guidance six months ago
  and expected it to conclude in the autumn. “We do think the guidance needs to
  change,” she said, adding that it was already the case that where police
  deemed it necessary more information on nationality was released.
