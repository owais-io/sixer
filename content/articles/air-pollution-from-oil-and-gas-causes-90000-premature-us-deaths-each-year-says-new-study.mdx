  Air pollution from oil and gas causes more than 90,000 premature deaths and
  sickens hundreds of thousands of people across the US each year, a new study
  shows, with disproportionately high impacts on communities of color. More than
  10,000 annual pre-term births are attributable to fine particulate matter from
  oil and gas, the authors found, also linking 216,000 annual childhood-onset
  asthma cases to the sector’s nitrogen dioxide emissions and 1,610 annual
  lifetime cancer cases to its hazardous air pollutants. The highest number of
  impacts are seen in California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
  while the per-capita incidences are highest in New Jersey, Washington DC, New
  York, California and Maryland. The analysis by researchers at University
  College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute is the first to examine
  the health impacts – and unequal health burdens – caused by every stage of the
  oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use. “We’ve long known that
  these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well
  as health burden,” said Karn Vohra, a postdoctoral research fellow in
  geography at University College London, who led the paper. “We were able to
  just put numbers to what that looks like.” While Indigenous and Hispanic
  populations are most affected by pollution from exploration, extraction,
  transportation and storage, Black and Asian populations are most affected by
  emissions from processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution and usage.
  Though the latter set of activities is responsible for less air pollution
  overall than the former, the study shows they cause the most unequal health
  burden, with impacts concentrated in majority-Black areas including southern
  Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” and eastern Texas. “What makes the study so
  valuable is how it dissects health impacts across the whole life cycle of oil
  and gas – from where it comes out of the ground to where it is combusted,”
  Timothy Donaghy, research director for the environmental group Greenpeace USA
  and author of previous research on the racially uneven burdens of fossil fuel
  pollution. “As many studies have found before, these health burdens are not
  shared equally – a prime example of fossil fuel racism in action.” For the
  analysis, published in Science Advances on Friday, the authors developed an
  inventory of each stage of oil and gas production and use, with data from the
  federal government and the University of Colorado Boulder. They plugged that
  data into a computer model to track pollution from each source, and used
  epidemiological and health data to track the adverse impacts of those
  emissions. These disproportionate impacts are not inexplicable; rather, they
  are attributable to historic policies such as redlining – a discriminatory
  mortgage appraisal practice used after the Great Depression by the US
  government – and high rates of permitting for oil and gas processing plants in
  close proximity to Black communities. Oil and gas are responsible for a major
  share of all air pollution-attributable health impacts in the US, the authors
  also found: one in five pre-term births and adult deaths linked to fine
  particulate pollution are from the sector, the authors found, while a stunning
  90% of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution are from
  oil and gas. The study is based on data from 2017, the most recent year of
  complete data available. Between that year and 2023, US oil and gas production
  has increased by 40% and consumption by 8%, meaning the estimates are probably
  highly conservative. The research comes as the Trump administration works to
  boost fossil fuel production and suppress renewable energy production. “Given
  the reckless deregulation being pushed by Trump’s EPA and the president’s call
  to ‘drill, baby, drill’, this new study should be a flashing red warning light
  for the nation,” said Donaghy. Eloise Marais, a University College London
  professor of geography and study co-author, said she hoped the study was
  “picked up by the kinds of community leaders and advocacy groups that are
  pushing for exposure to cleaner air”. “If there was a move away from reliance
  on oil and gas, we would experience the climate change benefits 50, 100, 200
  years from today because the greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere so long,”
  she said. “But communities would experience the health benefits immediately.”
