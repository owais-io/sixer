  I’ve been with my wife for 12 years. She recently admitted she has had many
  more sexual partners than me, more than 50 for sure, but it could be 100. She
  has only had a couple of long-term relationships. I didn’t think the number
  bothered me: I didn’t know her then, it was before we got together and we
  can’t change the past. However, we hardly ever have sex (only once every three
  to four months) and her sex drive dropped off a cliff after our first child
  was born almost 10 years ago. She says it’s the stress of children but I can’t
  help feeling she just doesn’t find me attractive any more. Rightly or wrongly,
  I now feel upset that she was willing to have sex with so many people before
  me but doesn’t want to have sex with me. When a partner’s libido drops, it is
  very common for the other to assume that the partner no longer feels the same
  attraction as before, but this is often not the case. It is very likely that
  your wife is finding it hard to summon sexual feelings generally because she
  does not feel like a sexual being herself. To experience desire for another
  person, you must feel sexually confident in yourself. Sexual confidence
  includes having a positive body image and perceiving yourself as a person who
  could attract others. It is true that the presence of children can lead to a
  disruption of libido through lack of privacy, fatigue, worry and other factors
  and it can also cause a woman to lose sight of the sexual person she once was.
  That conversation about her previous partners may even have been a misguided
  attempt on her part to excite you and reconnect herself with her previous
  erotic nature. Instead of focusing on her past, try to think of ways to help
  her think of herself as a sensual being, perhaps by looking back on erotic
  moments at the beginning of your relationship. Sometimes returning to
  situations where you shared such moments can serve as reminders and
  inspiration to help you return to intimacy. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a
  US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. If you
  would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description
  of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send
