  Almost a thousand days have passed since Lucas Paquetá was shown a yellow card
  for a late challenge on Leicester’s Boubakary Soumaré in a tame home defeat
  for West Ham in November 2022, an otherwise inconsequential booking that
  triggered an extraordinary chain of events that left the Brazilian fighting
  for his career. As Paquetá’s lawyer noted after he was cleared of spot-fixing
  on Thursday, Paquetá has shown more spirit and resilience during his two-year
  legal battle with the Football Association than his teammates managed that
  afternoon, although even after being exonerated in the most high-profile
  corruption case to hit English football since the Bruce Grobbelaar
  match-fixing trial three decades ago, the West Ham midfielder’s victory feels
  somewhat pyrrhic. Paquetá has lost an £85m transfer to Manchester City that
  would have brought him millions and the chance to be part of the club’s
  Premier League title success of 2023-24. This is due to the FA integrity
  department’s decision, after an investigation than began in August 2023, that
  apparently unusual betting patterns surrounding four yellow cards for the
  27-year-old were sufficient to charge him with spot-fixing. West Ham also lost
  a huge transfer fee, so it is little wonder they are considering legal action
  against the FA and will certainly push hard for the governing body to cover
  costs estimated at around £1m for the player and club. West Ham are angry that
  the case has taken so long to conclude. With two years left on his contract,
  Paquetá retains value, but given many Premier League clubs have profitability
  and sustainability rules (PSR) issues, and there are only four weeks left in
  the transfer window, selling him this summer will be challenging, even though
  he has been cleared. The FA’s investigators were hindered by difficulties in
  obtaining evidence from Brazil, and it took nine months of digging before
  charges were issued in May 2024. But the case has been beset by delays
  throughout. After Paquetá was charged West Ham lobbied for the hearing to be
  expedited. It did not begin until March this year and was adjourned, finally
  concluding at the beginning of June. West Ham have consequently faced
  uncertainty over Paquetá’s position for three summer transfer windows, while
  the player has been in turmoil, particularly after learning that the FA was
  pushing for a life ban. Several staff members at West Ham have told the
  Guardian that Paquetá’s demeanour has barely altered at the training ground
  over the last two years despite the severity of the charges, although a source
  who knows him personally said the case has taken its toll. That was clear when
  he burst into tears after being booked in a Premier League game against
  Tottenham in May, which led to his wife, Maria Fournier, writing on Instagram
  that the family had “been living this nightmare for two years”. The high
  stakes for Paquetá contrast with the modest amounts wagered in the allegedly
  corrupt bets. Around 60 bets were placed on Paquetá to be shown a yellow card
  in four Premier League games in 2022 and 2023, with the claim being that he
  was deliberately booked to make money for family and friends. A source with
  knowledge of the FA’s investigation said one of the bets was for £7, with the
  highest £400. While Paquetá’s problems began with the Soumaré yellow card, it
  was subsequent bookings against Aston Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth in 2023
  that led to the investigation. The fouls in each case were a lunge at John
  McGinn, pulling Crysencio Summerville’s shirt and a handball in an aerial
  challenge, offences that his legal team argued were symptomatic of his
  carelessness, rather than being deliberate. The initial investigation into
  Paquetá’s behaviour was conducted by the International Betting Integrity
  Association (IBIA), which received an integrity alert after several bookmakers
  in Brazil reported an unusual number of bets on Paquetá to be booked during
  the Villa game on 12 March 2023. The majority of the suspicious bets were
  traced to Paquetá Island, an idyllic, 0.5sq mile beach paradise off the coast
  of Rio de Janeiro, where Paquetá was born and from which he takes his name.
  Ironically, most of the money staked on Paquetá to be booked used accounts
  with Betway, which at the time was West Ham’s shirt sponsor. The concern of
  integrity officials was heightened by the fact most of the money came from new
  accounts. The FA’s investigation was triggered by the booking Paquetá received
  at Bournemouth in West Ham’s opening game of the following season, the fourth
  foul he had conceded that afternoon. The referee Peter Bankes’s report noted
  that he had booked Paquetá for “persistent infringement”, which along with the
  number of bets placed on him to be cautioned was enough to trigger a formal
  inquiry. Much of Paquetá’s defence is believed to have centred on his claim
  that he asked the then West Ham manager, David Moyes, not to play him at
  Bournemouth for fear of jeopardising the City move, which they argue
  demonstrated his booking could not have been premeditated. Moyes is understood
  to have supported this version of events, and given evidence to the
  independent commission on Paquetá’s behalf. Paquetá’s lead counsel, Nick De
  Marco KC, is also understood to have produced betting data showing that
  Paquetá frequently attracts a statistically unusual volume of bets to be
  booked, which they attribute to his poor disciplinary record. Paquetá’s legal
  team also showed the panel Paquetá’s entire disciplinary history, arguing that
  he has consistently conceded more free-kicks than his teammates throughout his
  career, which they argued increased the chances of him being booked. The
  publication of the independent commission’s written reasons, which are not
  expected for a number of weeks, will reveal more about a fascinating case, and
  may make awkward reading for the FA.
