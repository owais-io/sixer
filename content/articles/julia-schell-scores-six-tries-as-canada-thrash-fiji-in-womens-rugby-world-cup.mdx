  Canada are quietly going about their business as the dark horses of this Rugby
  World Cup with eyes firmly on the hosts, England, and the defending champions,
  New Zealand. The team may benefit from flying under the radar with less
  pressure on their shoulders but it does not make them any less a contender for
  the trophy. The clinical nature of their opener against Fiji announced their
  arrival in England in style, particularly through the full-back Julia Schell
  who was spectacular in the second half as she scored six tries in 21 minutes.
  Schell’s performance may have inspired girls to pick up a rugby ball but she
  is used to trying to make change. She grew up playing ice hockey and
  petitioned at elementary school for women to be able to do open-ice hitting as
  it was banned. “My petition said ’girls should be able to hit’ but it was
  fitting how I ended up in rugby where it is the same for men and women,”
  Schell said post-match. “To score six tries feels good. I was joking with the
  fans, one said just before the first one ‘200 bucks for a try’ so I have to
  find him!” The fact Canada are being overlooked by many does not correlate to
  recent results with wins against Australia and the USA and a draw against the
  Black Ferns at Pacific Four. They are also ranked as the No 2 side in the
  world so the 11-try result was not surprising in the hugely physical battle
  between the two nations which also saw replacement Fiji prop Bulou Vasuturaga
  shown a red card for a high tackle after a bunker review. Fiji, who are led by
  the former Wales coach Ioan Cunningham, fronted up in defence but the women in
  red were the first to score through Sophie De Goede and then Gillian Boag.
  Just as momentum was swinging firmly in the Canadians’ direction they were hit
  with a yellow card, which was referred to the bunker but remained a yellow,
  after the fly-half Taylor Perry made a high tackle. Canada only increased
  their lead though with a try from Caroline Crossley and they added another
  once back to 15 through Alysha Corrigan. Fiji finished the half strongly but
  were unable to execute promising attacks, with their brightest sparks Mereoni
  Nakesa and captain Alfreda Fisher. The best try of the match opened the second
  half and it was free-flowing Fijian fluency which rendered the biggest cheer
  of the afternoon when replacement winger Kolora Lomani went over. Canada
  responded perfectly with Schell’s six tries and they came after Canada head
  coach, Kévin Rouet, had a word with her. “I said to her at half-time: ‘Julia
  you need to win your one-v-ones’ and she was like ‘I am going to prove you
  wrong’ and she did.” Fiji’s afternoon got worse with Vasuturaga’s trip to the
  sin bin upgraded to a red card and Karen Paquin rounded off the scoring in a
  dominant outing. Rivals would have been watching from their respective camps
  knowing they cannot underestimate Canada’s challenge for this World Cup.
