  The Seattle Sounders defeated Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on
  Sunday, and the time between the final whistle and the trophy lift offered
  eyebrow-raising scenes all their own. Luis Suárez, who got into a few minor
  altercations but was frustratingly goal-less through the intense, physical
  match, took time after the final whistle to confront Sounders midfielder Obed
  Vargas. In that interaction, Suárez put his arm tightly around Vargas’ neck
  before being pulled away by Sounders players as more players and staff from
  both teams joined the melee. At one point, after being pulled away from a
  large group confrontation, Suárez was shown on camera berating Sounders
  director of security Gene Ramirez, then spitting on Ramirez as he was pulled
  away by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari and a Sounders staff member. The
  incident is the latest controversy in a long career full of them for Suárez,
  including biting opponents on three separate occasions, numerous high-profile
  instances of simulation, and other moments of overly physical play of violent
  conduct. In the past, MLS has handed down multi-game suspensions for spitting
  on players or match officials. Last season, Héctor Herrera was given a
  three-match ban for spitting in the direction of a referee – one game for the
  red card he received after VAR intervention, and two more from the league
  office. In 2023, Real Salt Lake’s Jasper Löffelsend was suspended for two
  games for spitting on an opponent. After the incident on Sunday night, Suárez
  collected his runners-up medal along with Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, and
  the rest of the Miami team who were held off successfully from scoring by a
  stingy Sounders side that by and large took advantage of their opportunities
  in front of goal. Miami, by contrast, spurned their own chances. Messi and
  Suárez combined in Miami’s best move of the night, but Messi surprisingly put
  his effort from just a few yards out over the bar. Tadeo Allende, also could
  have equalized for Miami in the second half. Osaze De Rosario, the son of
  former MLS great Dwayne de Rosario, struck first in the 26th minute, and
  Seattle sealed the trophy with two goals in the game’s closing stages as Miami
  pushed numbers forward. Of chief importance in Seattle’s resistance was
  Vargas, the 20-year-old Alaska native who plays for Mexico’s national team.
  The defensive midfielder broke up numerous Miami attacks in central midfield,
  successfully intervening to snuff out runs from Messi and ensuring that Suárez
  rarely had the service he needed. The flashpoint between Vargas and Suárez led
  to the larger confrontation between players and staff of both teams that could
  see some key players banned for upcoming games in the stretch run of the MLS
  season. In that gathering, cameras showed Miami’s Busquets put his hands to
  the face of Vargas, while multiple Sounders staff members seemed to escalate
  the situation by forcefully pulling Miami players away. With the win, Seattle
  will qualify directly to the round of 16 of next year’s Concacaf Champions
  Cup, while Miami qualifies for the earlier stage of that tournament by virtue
  of making the Leagues Cup final. The trophy is Seattle’s ninth major honor
  since joining MLS in 2009.
