  When Donald Trump fought for and won the 2024 presidential election, his
  victory was built partly on the false assertion that Democrats were
  responsible for an out-of-control crime wave in the US, with murders and rapes
  at record highs. Figures released by the FBI on Tuesday, however, confirm that
  the nation was as safe as it ever had been during the final full year of the
  Biden administration. Every category of crime decreased in frequency, and
  violent crime in particular dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s, per
  the report. The bureau’s annual Reported Crimes in the Nation Statistics
  report reflects a 4.5% year-on-year decrease in all violent crime nationally
  in 2024, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter falling 14.5% from the
  2023 figure. Reported rapes were down 5.2% from the year before, while
  aggravated assaults and robberies declined 3% and 8.9% respectively. The
  figures belie Trump’s oft-repeated fear-mongering during the election campaign
  that “soft-on-crime” Democrats had fueled surging crime rates, particularly in
  major cities under their control. In May 2024, for example, Trump told
  reporters attending his hush-money trial in Manhattan that New York
  prosecutors were fixated on his prosecution while “people are being mugged and
  killed outside … [I’ve] never seen anything like it in my life”. Yet the FBI
  report shows that murders in cities with more than 1 million residents
  declined by 19.1%, the highest percentage of any category of crime, while
  rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults showed drops of between 1% and 9.8%.
  “The nation’s murder rate for 2024 was down 26% from 2020’s figure and roughly
  even, slightly lower actually, relative to where it stood pre-pandemic,” crime
  analyst Jeff Asher said on his Substack channel Jeff-alytics. “The nation’s
  reported violent and property crime rates stood at the lowest levels since the
  1960s in 2024.” Asher injected a note of caution by pointing out that the FBI
  had added the prefix “reported” to the publication’s former title Crimes in
  the Nation to reflect the fact that the figures were compiled by voluntary
  submissions from more than 16,000 state, county, city, university and college,
  and tribal law enforcement agencies. “Not every crime is reported to law
  enforcement and not every agency reports crime to the FBI every year,” he
  said. But, he added: “The 2024 data adds confidence that 2025 will feature the
  lowest murder rate ever recorded. The odds have gone from ‘plausible’ to ‘more
  likely than not’.” Overall, the FBI recorded more than 14m criminal offenses
  nationally in 2024. Reported data, the bureau said, showed that a violent
  crime occurred, on average, every 25.9 seconds, with a murder every 31.1
  minutes and a rape every 4.1 minutes. The report comprises five sections,
  including an analysis of the frequency of hate crimes, and the number of
  assaults or killings of law enforcement officers. In the former category, data
  covering 95.1% of the US population showed 11,679 criminal incidents, and
  13,683 related offenses motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry,
  religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity, small
  drops from the respective 2023 figures of 11,862 and 13,829. The Arab American
  Institute cast doubt on the accuracy of the reporting in a statement.
  “Although some bias categories experienced slight declines from last year’s
  record highs, these numbers should be interpreted cautiously,” Maya Berry, the
  group’s executive director, said. “From the chronic underreporting problem to
  discrepancies in hate crime reporting between communities, to the deeply
  troubling moves to politicize hate crime data collection, we must understand
  this data serves as not only a stark reminder of the challenges we face, but a
  call to action. It underscores the urgent need for civil rights protections
  that are robust, inclusive, and enforced.” A dark spot on the report was data
  showing that 64 law enforcement officers had been killed “feloniously” during
  2024 in the line of duty, with firearms used in 46 of the deaths.
  Additionally, 43 more officers died in accidents over the year, most in
  vehicle-related incidents. The number of law enforcement personnel who
  reported they had been assaulted in 2024 rose to 85,730, a 10-year high. The
  2025 figure to be published next year is expected to rise significantly to
  reflect homeland security department (DHS) claims that assaults on immigration
  and customs enforcement agency (Ice) officers have risen 830% since Trump’s
  second term began in January. Prosecutors, however, have dropped or refused to
  pursue charges against numerous individuals citing false and misleading
  reports by immigration officers and video footage showing those accused of
  assaults were actually the victims.
