  Over the past four weeks, the Covid-19 inquiry has examined how the care
  sector was affected by a lack of testing and protective equipment and by the
  decisions that led to a surge of infections. Among the core participants were
  bereaved groups who said “their loved ones who died cannot raise their voices
  so they seek truth and accountability on their behalf”. Matt Hancock defended
  his controversial decision to send untested patients into care homes The
  former health and social care secretary’s evidence was the most highly
  anticipated of this stage, and was ultimately disappointing for bereaved
  groups who said it was “full of excuses and completely devoid of
  accountability”. Hancock said sending untested hospital patients into care
  homes to free up bed space was the “least worst decision that could have been
  taken at the time”. He insisted that “he still can’t find a better option” and
  said it was in line with the guidance from medical experts at the time. The
  policy was blamed for causing outbreaks of Covid in care homes, with one civil
  servant saying the 46,000 deaths in the sector were a “generational
  slaughter”. Hancock placed the blame firmly on Public Health England, saying
  its recommendations had not kept up with the reality of the unfolding
  situation. “I got so frustrated with PHE I abolished them,” he said. “There
  wasn’t enough testing, there wasn’t enough PPE. The public health authorities
  had the wrong attitude and the wrong doctrine. All of these things needed
  fixing and one by one we did everything we could to fix them.” Helen Whately,
  the care minister at the time, said hospital patients being discharged into
  care homes “shouldn’t have happened” and care homes should not have been
  expected to “serve the NHS in this”. Care home staff were 'terrified' by the
  lack of testing and distress of residents The inquiry heard that many care
  homes experienced “clinical abandonment” during the pandemic. In some of the
  most distressing evidence heard by the inquiry, a care home owner and manager
  from Wrexham described the unfolding chaos and how staff struggled to provide
  care without adequate PPE and testing. Helen Louise Hough claimed she was told
  that her residents “would not be considered for ventilation” if they became
  seriously ill with Covid and she could not get her local GP to attend in
  person to provide care. In one particularly harrowing incident, she said the
  home’s first resident to die with Covid was left gasping for breath and
  begging for help in her final hours after Hough had been denied a prescription
  for oxygen. Her husband, Vernon, witnessed the resident’s distress and later
  took his own life as the toll of the pandemic wore on. Many staff members
  worked long hours and stayed in an attic and in a caravan on site to reduce
  the risk of bringing the disease into the home. But with testing unavailable
  in the early weeks there was no way of telling who had Covid. Caroline
  Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: “Being in a care home turned out to be
  almost the worst place you could be during a pandemic.” Blanket policies
  banning visits led to rapid declines in physical and mental health Members of
  bereaved groups spoke powerfully about the impact of being unable to visit
  their relatives for months at a time, in many cases missing out on seeing them
  in the last weeks of their lives. Jane Weir-Wierzbowska, of Covid-19 Bereaved
  Families for Justice, said her mother, who had dementia, deteriorated rapidly
  when her visits stopped. She could only look on from outside the room –
  talking through a mobile phone wrapped in a bin bag and placed on her mother’s
  shoulder – as her mother neared the end of her life. “I just felt like I’d let
  her down so badly and that guilt is with me always,” she said. The inquiry
  heard that dementia patients suffered the most from the ban on visits and
  there was a disproportionate amount of excess deaths in this group. People
  with dementia accounted for a quarter of all Covid-related deaths in England
  and Wales. Residents also described the distress caused by long periods stuck
  in isolation to try to stop the spread of Covid. One woman said she was placed
  in solitary for 65 days and felt like “a caged animal”. Joanna Killian, the
  chief executive of the Local Government Association, said the trauma of
  separation was “inhumane and can’t happen again”. Rolling back of legislation
  meant individual rights 'were sidelined' Laws such as the Care Act 2014 and
  the Equality Act 2010 were eased during the pandemic to help the care system
  manage the pressure of the pandemic. But Helen Wildbore, the director of Care
  Rights UK, said this meant that “people’s rights became negotiable and
  sidelined” and individual needs were neglected. She said the pausing of
  routine inspections removed vital impartial oversight of care, and enforced
  supervision during visits meant it was harder for people to report abuse or
  neglect. Disability rights groups said “no government should have legislated
  to allow local authorities to cease meeting pre-existing eligible needs” and
  that disabled people felt their lives were less valued.
