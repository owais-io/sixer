  Six years ago, Melbourne-based film-maker Kristina Kraskov read an article
  about an international Microsoft Excel competition and had two thoughts. The
  first: “What the hell, that can’t be real.” The second: “There’s got to be a
  film about this – I want to watch it so badly.” There wasn’t a film about
  competitive spreadsheeting, so Kraskov decided to make it herself. The subject
  appealed to the director, whose work captures “different inner worlds that are
  a bit unusual on the outside”, including a short film titled Party in the
  Back, about a mullet festival. Spreadsheet Champions, which will screen at the
  Melbourne international film festival, follows six young competitors from
  around the world as they head to Florida for the 2023 Microsoft Office
  Specialist world championship to showcase their skills. It might sound silly,
  but Excel is an incredibly sophisticated application – according to the
  documentary, the average person uses only 10-15% of its capabilities, but
  would-be competitors are required to understand closer to 70% of what it can
  do. The competition is built and run by Certiport, a performance-based
  examination provider, and officially endorsed by Microsoft. It’s a two-parter:
  the first half tests proficiency in formulas, functions and features through a
  series of complex questions, graded on both accuracy and speed. The second
  section is a more creative application of this knowledge – as Kraskov puts it,
  “understanding the story of the data, or the soul of what it is actually
  telling you”. The championship has run since 2002 and is open to students
  between the ages of 13 and 22. Each competitor first has to qualify as the
  best in their home country. For such an esoteric endeavour, the stakes are
  oddly high – the MOS championship only allows competitors to enter once in
  their lives. “In most sporting competitions, you have your main players that
  come back every year and your very set rivalries – but for this competition,
  they can only compete once, so everyone that’s coming through can never come
  back,” Kraskov says. “They qualify in their home countries at vastly different
  times around the world, so it made it really challenging for us – but as soon
  as anyone qualified in a country that we could go to, we would talk to them on
  Zoom, and work our way down from there.” The six competitors in Spreadsheet
  Champions are Alkimini, 20, from Greece; Braydon, 16, from Australia; Carmina,
  16, from Guatemala; De La Paix, 19, from Cameroon (who doesn’t have a laptop
  or wifi, so had to study at school); Mason, 15, from the US; and Nam, 21, from
  Vietnam. Each contestant has personality quirks which shine through in the
  film – from the camera-shy and stereotypically “nerdy” to the charismatic and
  boisterous. “Our intention is really about how amazing this competition is –
  we’re not here to make fun of or disparage anyone,” Kraskov says. Kraskov and
  the film’s producer, Anna Charalambous, spent about a week with each
  competitor in their home country, observing their day-to-day lives, from home
  to school, and spending time with their family and friends. “People reveal
  themselves a lot if you just pay attention to how they live their lives,”
  Kraskov says. “Teenagers are not quite fully formed adults yet, so they don’t
  really connect things about themselves or their personalities – they just live
  their lives. The parents were so insightful and knowledgable about their kids
  – it gave us a lot of information about how they would potentially thrive or
  struggle, and who they really were.” Many of the contest’s specifics are
  shrouded in secrecy, which posed another challenge for the film-makers. The
  competition is overseen by a man named – in a wonderful example of nominative
  determinism – Bing. “It’s so high-level security,” Kraskov says. “Bing
  eventually trusted us and gave us questions that would be retired … At the end
  of the day, he has to deliver a hardcore, secure, world-expert level exam the
  next year, and our priority is to show the complexity of what it is and what
  they’re doing.” Participating in the MOS Championship can set these kids up
  for adult life. Carmina, the Guatemalan competitor, is now 18 and studying
  mechatronics engineering at university. In the film, she is shown as a bubbly,
  bright teenager who loves One Direction (she still does) and excels at, well,
  Excel. Watching the documentary transported Carmina back to the competition
  and her younger self – and made her realise what she took from the experience.
  “I knew the results already, but watching it again [I felt] a little bit of
  suspense,” she says. “I tend to doubt a little bit of myself and with that
  experience [of competing] I learned to just go into it and try things out … It
  helped me a lot.” Spreadsheet Champions had its world premiere at SXSW in
  Texas earlier this year and five of the six students will be in Melbourne to
  attend Miff. Kraskov is proud to shine a light on them – everyday people doing
  something a little different with their lives. “Celebrities, musicians and
  models get plenty of attention,” she says. “But people that dedicate their
  lives to things that a lot of people don’t care about – I find that so much
  more fascinating.” Spreadsheet Champions airs at the Melbourne international
  film festival from 10-24 August; see here for all dates and locations.
