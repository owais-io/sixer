  On the opening night of Green Man, the BSL interpreters are having to dig
  deep. “What’s ‘Fenian cunt’ in sign language?” Kneecap’s Mo Chara asks them.
  “What’s ‘off my head on ket’”? As European festivals ban them, the finest one
  in Wales – arguably the UK – has kept the Irish trio on the bill, and their
  combination of druggy lairyness, larky republicanism and very serious
  pro-Palestinian solidarity, combined with mic technique a jungle MC might
  envy, makes for an explosive start. Some of the hip-hop numbers are corny – a
  sort of Fresh Prince of Belfast – but over trap and rave they’re peerlessly
  thrilling. Their set gives Green Man an undeniable shot of vitality, as does a
  set by CMAT as the Irish star enters pop’s stratosphere, off the back of
  TikTok virality and a euphoric Glasto set. Namechecking Welsh legends
  Catatonia, Shirley Bassey, H from Steps and Tom Jones, it feels as if she
  needs a Jones-style TV variety show to house her entertainment prowess: the
  songs have country homeliness but Stevie Nicks-style arena mysticism; her
  banter is silly but topped with political spikes as she passionately
  celebrates Wales’s preservation of their national language. It all earns her
  possibly the biggest main stage crowd this festival has ever seen. Folk-rock
  and indie-rock have long been Green Man’s bread and butter, and the triumphant
  breadth of those styles is on full show. Caroline’s emotional blend of art
  rock and midwest emo, their song Total Euphoria delivering just that;
  Jasmine.4.t’s alt-rock songs of dissociating in supermarkets and “the healing
  power of transsexual love”, which already feel like classics; MJ Lenderman’s
  euphoric southern US rock, the result of what might happen if Neil Young and
  Lynyrd Skynyrd kissed and made up; and a spellbinding tribute to Bob Dylan
  from folk collective Broadside Hacks. Renditions of Maggie’s Farm and Like a
  Rolling Stone are a bit broad – it turns out you can sing Dylan out of tune –
  but his early folk material is stirringly performed by Dan MacDonald (AKA
  Spitzer Space Telescope) and Clara Mann, and how trenchant the savagely ironic
  militarism of With God on Our Side still feels. Beyond those core styles, the
  festival feels more socially and musically diverse than ever. There’s a global
  remit with acts from DRC’s Fulu Miziki to German-Turkish-led Derya Yildirim
  &amp; Grup Şimşek and India’s Asha Puthli, distilled aura emanating from the
  latter as she grooves over light disco and shares memories of drag queens and
  Andy Warhol. The Friday lunchtime set from South African vocal quintet the Joy
  feels like God pointing at us from a cloudless sky: unfeasibly beautiful
  harmonising, including dubstep-worthy bass penetration from their lowest
  voice. As the styles expand further outward, Underworld are the most banging
  act to ever headline here, Karl Hyde’s dance moves rivalling those of an oiled
  and shirtless podium dancer in 90s Ibiza, and Bicep side project Dove rolls
  around techno, speed garage and UK bass in a juggernaut of digital noise. US
  rapper Mike unspools soliloquies over subaquatic beats but there’s plenty of
  crowd participation – and even a dance contest – to keep it populist. And New
  York no-wavers YHWH Nailgun are simply one of the best live bands in the world
  right now, their constantly mutating funk setting off three concurrent styles
  of dancing in the crowd: pogoing, salsa and dub skanking. There are
  shortcomings: so many songs in Wet Leg’s headline set are powered by the same
  four-to-the-floor stomp and while they have a genuine rock star in front
  person Rhian Teasdale, they don’t have the melodic invention to stop it
  feeling samey – a problem also faced by rising band Divorce, whose songs
  wander aimlessly. Smashing up a malfunctioning amp at the end, Wunderhorse
  evidently feel their set is a disaster – “if there’s a God, well fuck him” is
  the reaction of front person Jacob Slater halfway through – but it actually
  sounds terrific out front, and the on-stage difficulties bring out something
  febrile and desperate in Slater’s singing. There is only one actual clunker:
  John Grant underselling a 24-carat golden hour by singing almost a full
  semitone flat for song after song. Nevertheless, Green Man’s batting average
  is still at a world-beating level, and its valley setting feels like a
  temporary utopia. Trans rights are frequently championed, and affirmations of
  Palestine’s right to freedom are voiced by everyone from Nilüfer Yanya to Been
  Stellar and closing headliners TV on the Radio, who acknowledge “monstrous”
  behaviour in the world but who meet it with a steadfast belief in something
  better, that “love is the province of the brave” as one song has it. That
  belief, combined with the festival’s blessedly anti-corporate feel, combines
  euphorically at the star-making set of the weekend from Joshua Idehen: a poet,
  musician, comedian, therapist and a kind of motivational speaker exhorting us
  to better ourselves. He instructs us to find “a joy with nothing to sell you”,
  something in abundance at Green Man.
