  USSR sweatshirt and chicken kyiv: Russia dials up trolling before Alaska
  summit

  In a not-so-subtle act of trolling, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov,
  arrived in Alaska on the eve of the US–Russia summit wearing a sweatshirt
  emblazoned with “CCCP”, the Russian initials for the USSR. Once seen in
  western capitals as a pragmatic and skilled diplomat, the 75-year-old has in
  recent years mirrored the Kremlin’s radicalised politics, adopting an
  increasingly combative tone and resorting to trolling and mockery. Lavrov’s
  choice of attire nods to the Kremlin’s long-running narrative: Putin has
  repeatedly claimed that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people”, denying
  Ukraine’s legitimacy and territorial integrity while promoting a broader
  notion of unity with Russia. Most of Russia’s veteran delegation to Alaska,
  including Lavrov, began their careers in the Soviet Union and have been
  accused by the Russian opposition of clinging to a Soviet imperialist
  mentality. Under Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory, pro-Moscow
  authorities have dismantled monuments commemorating Ukrainian suffering under
  Soviet rule, including memorials to victims of Holodomor, the mass famine in
  Soviet Ukraine in the 1930s that killed millions of Ukrainians. The former
  Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis quipped on X about Lavrov’s
  clothing choice: “‘Just give us half of Ukraine and we promise we will stop,’
  says negotiator wearing USSR sweatshirt.” Russian fashion bloggers on Telegram
  were quick to identify the $120 sweatshirt as the work of Selsovet, a
  Chelyabinsk-based brand that specialises in “Soviet heritage” clothing.
  Lavrov’s antics were the latest in a string of Russian provocations leading up
  to the summit, aimed at unsettling Ukraine and its European allies. Earlier,
  the editor-in-chief of RT, Margarita Simonyan, wrote that the Russian press
  corps flying to Alaska had been served chicken kyiv cutlets. The menu choice
  was quickly seized upon by other Russian propagandists. “Putin and Trump
  should turn Zelenskyy into a chicken kyiv. There’s no shortage of humour in
  the Kremlin,” wrote the pro-Kremlin commentator Sergei Markov. Russia’s state
  press, however, were in a less celebratory mood on arrival at their modest
  sleeping quarters in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city, where the summit will
  take place. With hotel space taken up by the influx of international media,
  Russian reporters were put up in the local ice hockey team’s stadium, which
  had been converted into a Covid hospital during the pandemic and fitted with
  army beds donated by the Red Cross. “We are living in Spartan conditions,” one
  reporter is heard complaining in a clip posted on social media.
