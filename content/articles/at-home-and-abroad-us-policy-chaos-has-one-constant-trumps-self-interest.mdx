  It was a language he could understand. Donald Trump had lost the 2020 US
  presidential election, Russia’s Vladimir Putin told him last Friday, because
  it was rigged through mail-in voting. Three days later, the president
  announced that lawyers were drafting an executive order to eliminate mail-in
  balloting, a method used by nearly a third of Americans that has not been
  credibly linked to election fraud. That an American president might take
  advice on how to run elections from a Russian dictator – who wins sham polls
  in a landslide while his opponents disappear or die – would have been
  unimaginable a decade ago. But it was not so surprising from Trump, who has
  made a habit of blurring the boundary between domestic policy grievances and
  foreign policy goals. He is uniquely vulnerable to manipulation, critics say,
  because he views national and international affairs through a single prism of
  self-interest. Charlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “In
  Donald Trump’s world there’s no significant distinction between what he does
  internationally and what he is doing domestically because all centers on
  himself. There’s no ideological through-line or consistency. “It’s all about
  what serves his own personal interests. The notion that you would roll out the
  red carpet for an internationally wanted war criminal 19 months after he
  murdered [opposition leader] Alexei Navalny would be vomit-inducing in any
  context. But given Trump’s long history with Vladimir Putin, I suppose it
  should be expected.” The conflation has been on display in Trump’s approach to
  immigration, with countries such as El Salvador currying favour by imprisoning
  the victims of mass deportation, and in his claim that trade tariffs will
  produce a renaissance of domestic manufacturing. Sanctions against Venezuela
  and Cuba were framed as appeals to domestic constituencies such as Cuban and
  Venezuelan exile communities in Florida. Trump’s first impeachment by the
  House of Representatives was a result of his effort to pressure Ukraine to
  investigate Joe Biden. But no country has played a more outsized role than
  Russia. In 2016 Trump asked Russians to hack his rival Hillary Clinton’s
  emails; this year he baselessly accused Barack Obama of “treason”, claiming he
  plotted to sabotage his first presidency by linking him to Russian election
  meddling. Then came last Friday’s much-hyped summit between Trump and Putin in
  Anchorage, Alaska. During a brief press conference, Putin assured the US
  president that, had he won the 2020 election instead of Biden, the war in
  Ukraine would never have happened. It was a talking point that Trump has
  deployed endlessly on last year’s campaign trail and since his return to the
  White House in January. It has been echoed by rightwing media but studiously
  avoided by foreign leaders. For it now to be parroted by Putin was evidently
  the validation that Trump craved. Tara Setmayer, a former Republican
  communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Donald Trump seems to have an
  inexplainable affinity for everything Vladimir Putin does and the way in which
  Russia’s elections are manipulated and not free and fair seems to be something
  Donald Trump aspires to to maintain power. “When Donald Trump echoes the
  sentiments of a murderous dictator, war criminal, enemy of the United States
  and decides to translate that into domestic American politics, it should raise
  alarms to everyone as to why he would want to emulate anything Vladimir Putin
  suggests.” Trump’s inward-looking obsessions also pose a challenge for
  visiting heads of state. During the past seven months many have been obliged
  to sit impassively as he holds court on Democrats, fake news or other local
  concerns that would normally be reserved for a domestic audience. On Monday,
  with the eyes of the world on the Oval Office, it was the turn of the
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to sit tight as Trump digressed on
  the topic of his law and order crackdown in Washington DC, recalling a recent
  conversation with a friend. “He has a son who’s a great golfer,” the
  79-year-old president rambled. “He’s on tour and he came in fourth yesterday
  in the big tournament where Scottie Scheffler made the great shot. And he said
  his son is going to dinner in Washington DC tonight. I said, ‘Would you allow
  that to happen a year ago?’ He said, ‘No way. No way.’” When a reporter asked
  Trump about his social media post regarding mail-in ballots, the president
  acknowledged, “Well, that’s a very off topic,” but could not resist embarking
  on a long and winding answer that included his vow to terminate mail-in voting
  and descended into a rant against Democrats: “Because with men and women’s
  sports, and with transgender for everybody, and open borders, and all of the
  horrible things, and now the new thing is, they love crime.” Notably, the
  Republican Trump’s encounter with Zelenskyy also included criticisms of his
  Democratic predecessor that were again reminiscent of the campaign trail.
  “Look, this isn’t my war; this is Joe Biden’s war,” Trump said. “Joe Biden, a
  corrupt politician, not a smart man – never was.” The Ukrainian leader, who in
  2023 heaped praise on Biden for making a surprise visit to Kyiv, and last year
  paid tribute to the 46th president’s “strong decisions” and “bold steps” in
  supporting the war effort, remained silent. Trump’s habit of bad-mouthing his
  predecessors marks yet another radical break from tradition. Whatever their
  private thoughts might have been, Ronald Reagan did not publicly denounce
  Jimmy Carter’s handling of the Iran hostage crisis when hosting foreign
  dignitaries, nor did Barack Obama lambast George W Bush for the invasion of
  Iraq. Joel Rubin, a former assistant deputy secretary of state, commented: “I
  find it shocking because American presidents historically leave other American
  presidents alone. They’ll criticise policies but they don’t go for personal
  taunts. “America’s strength as a country when it comes to foreign policy is
  our consistency and bipartisan mindset and national patriotism. The
  denigrating of previous American presidents in front of international
  audiences is very stark and very different. Trump is doing something that
  nobody else has done before.” Trump’s default, Rubin added, was to say that
  Biden was the worst at everything. “It wasn’t like they asked him about Biden.
  He chose to bring it up. It conveys a deep insecurity about his sense of place
  and what he’s doing. He’s attempting to demonstrate greatness by continually
  denigrating others. “If the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, was
  interviewed and constantly trashing Sunak or Cameron or whatever – ‘Oh, those
  people they did Brexit’ – it gives off an image as if the country is coming
  unglued.”
