  Activists have hailed a historic judgment striking down colonial-era laws that
  criminalised gay sex in St Lucia as a step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in the
  Caribbean country. This week the Eastern Caribbean supreme court found that
  the island’s so-called buggery and gross indecency laws, which criminalised
  consensual anal sex, were unconstitutional. In a joint statement to the
  Guardian, a group of activists who were the claimants in the case described
  the judgment as “deeply personal” but added that there was “still work to be
  done”. “We know not everyone will agree with the ruling – and that’s OK. We’re
  not asking anyone to change their beliefs. What we are asking for is fairness.
  These laws were outdated and violated the basic human rights of LGBTQ+ people.
  Striking them down is just the beginning of creating a safer, more inclusive
  Saint Lucia for all of us,” the statement said. Speaking to reporters at a
  press conference after the judgment, attorney Veronica Cenac, who worked on
  the case, said it was important to remember the origin of the laws. “Many
  persons believe that [they are] a part of our cultural identity and that those
  persons who are asking for their repeal are promoting a western, global north
  agenda – which is clearly not the case considering that these laws were
  imposed on us during colonial times,” she said. In St Lucia, the law penalised
  gay sex with up to 10 years in prison. While the government did not enforce
  the law, activists and legal experts say it remained a threat to the island’s
  LGBTQ+ community. “The mere existence of this provision is itself a violation
  of human rights and underpins further acts of discrimination,” according to
  Human Dignity Trust, a UK-based legal organisation that helped work on the
  case. In 2019, the Eastern Caribbean Alliance for Diversity and Equality began
  filing legal challenges against such laws in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados,
  Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Lucia. In 2022, courts in Barbados,
  Antigua and Barbuda, and St Kitts and Nevis struck down those laws. Last year,
  a court in Dominica did the same. Describing how hearing the monumental
  judgment left them “breathless”, Kenita Placide, the Alliance’s executive
  director, said: “It is not often that we, as activists, get to see the results
  of our hard work.” But, they warned that, while the outcome was a “stride in
  the right direction”, LGBTQ+ people in St Lucia needed to remain on guard.
  Several gay men have been brutally murdered in the country over the years, and
  Placide warned that the judgment did not mean “that all of a sudden we can do
  the gay parade without thinking about safety”. “Right now, there’s a little
  bit of a tension in country. Because almost every two males that walk around
  are being watched with some kind of scrutiny that they may be engaging. And
  people are ready to put up phones like they need to be the first to capture,”
  Placide said. Changing the law was “half the battle”,Placide said, adding that
  the other half was “changing hearts and minds where we can actually coexist in
  the community without being killed” because of sexual orientation. Téa Braun,
  the chief executive of the Human Dignity Trust, said: “This is a significant
  victory for the Caribbean’s LGBT community and now leaves just five remaining
  jurisdictions in the western hemisphere that continue to criminalise
  consensual same-sex intimacy.” The judgment, Cenac said, could have
  “persuasive value” in the remaining countries: Jamaica, Grenada, Guyana, St
  Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Earlier this year, the
  Trinidad and Tobago supreme court overturned a 2018 high court judgment to
  remove its “buggery” laws. Campaigners have expressed concern about the
  country’s case, which will go before the privy council in London, the final
  court of appeal for UK overseas territories and some Commonwealth countries.
  One of the issues, they say, is a “savings clause”, a legal technicality
  created to protect colonial laws. Trinidad and Tobago-based Sharon Mottley,
  regional programme manager for the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
  Trans, and Intersex Association of North America and the Caribbean, said the
  ruling brought “renewed hope and momentum” to the region. “Here in Trinidad
  and Tobago, in spite of the reversal this year, the gay community came out in
  their numbers and we held our Pride Parade on July 20th through the streets of
  Port of Spain and it was really to send a powerful message that we’re here and
  we’re not going anywhere. We refuse to be criminalised and our visibilities,
  our pride, our resistance and our demand for full recognition will continue,”
  Mottley said.
