  As dating apps using height filters spark debate on “heightism”, the
  Blackadder star Tony Robinson has vented his anger at women who feel it is
  acceptable to comment on men’s height. “Nowadays, you don’t pick on people’s
  looks, do you? It’s like kind of a new understanding over the last 10 or 15
  years, you don’t deride people for what they look like,” the 5ft 4in actor,
  78, told Elizabeth Day’s How to Fail podcast, admitting he had seen his
  shorter than average height as a problem in life. Studies over decades show
  heightism leads to bias, yet it appears even today to be more socially
  acceptable than other forms of physical prejudice. The term “heightism” was
  first coined by the sociologist Saul Feldman in 1971. Dr Erin Pritchard, a
  senior lecturer in sociology and disability studies at Liverpool Hope
  University, believes much heightism is subconscious, but that it is ingrained.
  It has also not benefited from widespread acceptance movements. “You had the
  fat acceptance movement, and while there’s still issues, you would never go,
  ‘well, how much do you weigh’? But it’s perfectly acceptable for people to go,
  ‘how tall are you’?” she said. It is reinforced through popular culture,
  “chicken and egg, I suppose. But you’re seeing it in films and in TV shows,
  jokes about short man syndrome,” she said. “Height is all about power, isn’t
  it? It’s quite a powerful thing.” And it is present in everyday language. We
  tell people to “walk tall”; we “look up to” people; those respected “have
  stature”; those less so “have shortcomings” or “fall short”. The US state of
  Michigan, the US cities Santa Cruz, San Francisco and New York City, as well
  as Ontario, Canada and Victoria, Australia, are among the few to address
  height discrimination in civil rights law. An increase in men’s height
  corresponds to increased income, according to a 2004 study published in the
  Journal of Applied Psychology. The term “height premium” emerged from another
  2004 study, which found an 1.8% increase in men’s wages accompanies every
  additional inch [2.54cm] of height, and that men’s wages as adults could be
  linked to their height at age 16. Women prefer a larger height difference
  between themselves and male partners, according to a 2013 study at the
  University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and were most satisfied when their
  partner was 21cm taller. Men, however, preferred an 8cm difference over female
  partners. There was a lighthearted, body positive movement during the 2022
  TikTok “short king spring”, in praise of short men. But then a 2023 study
  suggested “short man syndrome”, often referred to as the Napoleon complex, may
  lead short men to compensate with antagonistic behaviours. The study claims
  evidence of “such a complex in those characterised by the dark triad traits of
  psychopathy (ie, callousness, criminality), narcissism (ie, inflated sense of
  self, grandiosity), and Machiavellianism (ie pragmatic cynicism, duplicity).”
  However, being too tall also attracts the unwelcome. The 6ft 7in comedian and
  actor Stephen Merchant has spoken of his weariness at relentless comments.
  Trying to be funny was a way of taking ownership of standing out. “If people
  are going to look at you, they may as well look at you and think what you are
  doing is good or funny or entertaining rather than just pointing and laughing.
  I guess I was a nerd and I felt a bit awkward because I was 6ft 7in even from
  a young age,” he told Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. The actor Geena Davis
  knocked two inches off her 6ft height to get accepted by modelling agencies in
  her youth. Miranda Hart, the Call the Midwife star, has said she is fed up
  with being defined by her 6ft 1in height. Nicole Kidman, at 5ft 11in, used to
  shave half an inch off to get auditions. A study of taller than average female
  college students found it resulted in unintended intimidation. Robert Reich,
  Bill Clinton’s labor secretary, a Rhodes Scholar and one of Time magazine’s 10
  best cabinet members of the century, is 4ft 11in, an issue he publicly
  addressed in a blogpost. “When it comes to choosing leaders, our society is
  exceptionally heightist and seems to be getting more so. My dear friend and
  mentor, the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith, was 6ft 8. He once said
  that favouring the tall was ‘one of the most blatant and forgiven prejudices
  in our society’.” But he added: “I’m fortunate to have grown up (or at least
  grown upward) in a society that, more and more, values brains over brawn.
  There are still bullies in the world, of course. But in a civil society, those
  bullies can be stopped with words and ideas. At least, that’s been my faith.
  That’s how I’ve tried to compensate for my short height.” Prichard said: “We
  need more voices like Tony Robinson coming out and saying it, to show this is
  not all woke nonsense, [to] just sort of sit down and listen to what they have
  to say and go, OK, these are their lived experiences.”
