  In the winter of 2010, less than two weeks before Christmas, dozens of parents
  in Amsterdam received terrible news. Police in the US had tipped off Dutch
  authorities that a young male childcare worker had sexually abused tens of
  young, preverbal children in his care, mostly boys under the age of two. The
  man confessed to numerous instances of abuse. The courts went on to convict
  him. And the parents of the children abused had to decide what to do next. As
  they grappled with the abuse of their child, the parents faced a difficult
  dilemma: If their child showed no signs of being traumatised by or even
  remembering the abuse, should they tell them? And how? It was a decision that
  researchers in the Netherlands tracked in a unique long-term study, posing
  questions now likely being asked by potentially thousands of parents in
  Australia, after allegations of serial abuse in childcare settings. “That’s
  the big question. ‘Now that I know, what do I do?’” says Hetty Johnson, the
  founder of Bravehearts, an Australian child protection organisation. “How do
  you rescue the child?” The burden of that decision is huge, says Johnson,
  “Parents are not equipped [to handle that]… If the child is non-verbal it’s
  even more difficult because then you’re left in a situation where you’re
  thinking ‘Well, am I going to give them too much information or not enough?
  How do I deliver that information? What are the words I use? “Do I even need
  to tell them or will they just forget about it?’” What a baby remembers Few
  people can remember anything before the age of three or four, by which stage
  most children gain language fluency. The period until that point is regularly
  called “infantile amnesia”. Additionally, there has historically been a belief
  that very young children feel pain less or feel it differently. Until the
  early 1980s it was routine for surgeries to be performed on babies without
  anaesthetic. This pair of assumptions led to what researchers now identify as
  a misconception that children may not be traumatised by events early in their
  lives. “It is difficult to scientifically demonstrate whether children
  remember abuse that happens in pre-verbal years but we do know children
  develop some forms of early implicit memories from birth or even before,” says
  Divna Haslam, a child psychologist and associate professor at the University
  of Queensland. “These memories are less about specific events and more about
  feelings and experiences and often fade with time. Episodic memory [the
  ability to remember specific events] typically develops around age four. This
  means while early abuse can impact children they may not vividly remember
  specific occurrences of very early abuse particularly over time.” Research
  into the impacts of early child abuse is limited. There has been an assumption
  that serious child sexual abuse does not happen often to children under the
  age of three, says Delanie Woodlock, deputy director of Childlight East Asia
  and Pacific at UNSW. “It’s kind of a neglected area because these children
  can’t tell us about what’s happened,” she says. Research has found that online
  child sexual assault material featuring infants and toddlers is “not
  uncommon”. “So contrary to what we have believed, and what we have dismissed
  in survivors, we now see so much evidence that this is occurring and has
  occurred for a long time,” says Woodlock. The Amsterdam case In the 15 years
  since the revelation of the abuse in Amsterdam, psychologists and researchers
  have been following a few dozen of the confirmed and strongly suspected
  victims and their families. It is a unique study in the under-researched
  field. Parents in the study reported their children had not been subject to
  any other maltreatment outside the sexual abuse case. Three years after the
  abuse was revealed, researchers found that 39% of the child survivors were
  asymptomatic. However, 30% showed sexual behaviour problems – defined as
  “overstepping normative behaviour, indicating a possible link to the [child
  sexual abuse]” – and eight years into the study researchers reported rates of
  such behaviour were still “high”. At three years into the study a quarter had
  attachment insecurity (although it was not possible to compare this rate to a
  control group). At the eight year mark, researchers reported “low percentages
  of PTSD and dissociation in children at each time point” over the study, and
  that symptoms of “disassociation” appeared to reduce over time. As for the
  parents, one in four demonstrated clinical PTSD symptoms at some point over
  eight years. Parents surveyed at the three year point reported feelings of
  guilt, shame and anger. One of the core things the researchers tracked was
  when, how and why parents did or did not tell their children about their abuse
  history. The decision to tell or not to tell was a significant source of worry
  for many parents, a 2024 paper by the researchers reported. Parents were
  cautious about the possible harm of keeping the abuse a secret and felt their
  child had a right to know, but were also worried about the impact that
  knowledge could have on their child. One told researchers: “Why should I do
  this to her? To ruin her life?… It is my worry, my problem”, citing a concern
  that the information would “damage my own daughter again”. Over 10 years, 41
  parents took part in interviews. At the 10-year mark more than two-thirds had
  chosen to tell their child. The researchers found that most parents said the
  child had no memory of the event. After they were told, many children were
  quiet or had questions. One child experienced PTSD after the disclosure,
  another asked why he had been told as he did not want to know. “None of the
  parents regretted disclosing,” the study found. “There is no strong evidence
  that disclosure is harmful,” the researchers concluded. However, they also
  found no evidence that children found out later and were angry at their
  parents for withholding the information, “suggesting that not disclosing is
  not necessarily harmful either. However, most parents seem to experience
  ongoing moral dilemmas with non-disclosure while disclosing provided relief
  for most parents.” ‘You can heal, you can recover’ Haslam is keen to stress
  that while for some children, particularly those for whom it was repeated or
  severe, sexual abuse in early childhood may prompt difficulties later in life,
  “this is not the case for all children”. Woodlock says families need to
  understand where certain behaviours in children might be coming from. But
  moving forward requires a balanced outlook. “It is a significant and sometimes
  catastrophic event in a child’s life,” she says. “But you can heal, you can
  recover.” Bravehearts’ Johnson says it is a mistake not to tell children of
  abuse in their history, not least because the child may have some form of
  memory retained or the trauma may manifest in different behaviour, feelings,
  aversions or fears. A child has the right to know what is in their past, she
  says, and withholding this kind of information can lead to conflict in the
  relationship if it is found out later. She says some parents hesitate to tell
  their child of past abuse for fear being labelled a “victim” will draw sex
  offenders towards that child in future. “The fact that the child has been a
  victim of crime is not the thing that gravitates sex offenders to that child,”
  she says. “It’s the disempowerment of a child. So when a child is sexually
  assaulted at whatever age, that takes some of their power away, their agency,
  their right to say no.” In her experience, telling a child can recover some of
  that power and reinforce that their parents intervened to protect the child as
  soon as the abuse was discovered. “Silence, secrecy, shame is not the solution
  to anything. That is the sex offender’s very best friend and our children’s
  very worst enemy.” Disclosing abuse for parents in the Amsterdam study was a
  gradual process, rather than a singular event. “Full disclosure will likely
  occur over a period of time with more information being provided as the child
  develops the emotional maturity to understand and discuss the topic, or even
  ask their own questions,” Haslam says. It is important, she says, to reinforce
  that the child is not at fault and follow the child’s lead. It may be that a
  conversation is very short, but it is key to keep the door open for further
  discussion. Importantly, Haslam says, parents should have processed their own
  emotions – potentially with psychological support – in advance, in order to be
  a calm and reassuring guide to their child. “It may also be appropriate to
  wait if the motivation to disclose is driven more by the parents’ needs than
  the child’s best interests,” she says. “Don’t make it a big deal,” says
  Johnson. “If it’s a big deal for you, don’t say it because the idea is to take
  away that fear and all that anxiety” and to replace it with reassurance and
  security. For Woodlock, recovery is something that happens in families and
  also something that needs to play out on a larger scale. “This happens on all
  of our watch,” she says. “It’s not inevitable, particularly in institutional
  care. This is 100% preventable. “I think that [preventing it happening again
  is] something we owe them, and we should be working towards that as a
  community. So it’s not just left up to parents.” • In Australia, children,
