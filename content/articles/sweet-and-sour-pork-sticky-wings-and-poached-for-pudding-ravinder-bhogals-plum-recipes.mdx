  There’s a windfall of delicious plums to be gathered in gardens and
  pick-your-own farms up and down the country right now, but they’re often
  overlooked. Instead, it’s peaches, nectarines and apricots that get all the
  glory. Well, more for me! Plums that haven’t flown in from far-flung places
  are best: sweet, tart, fleshy and complex in flavour. It’s a no-brainer to
  earmark them for comforting cakes and puddings, but they are an equally worthy
  companion for meat, such as duck, pork or fried chicken, because their natural
  sharpness cuts through any fatty richness. Sticky chicken wings with plum
  ketchup (pictured above) This ketchup is fruity, sweet and sharp, and the
  perfect thing to swipe moreish chicken wings through. Prep 20 min Marinate 1
  hr+ Cook 1 hr 15 min Serves 6 For the chicken wings 4 garlic cloves, peeled
  and finely chopped 2cm piece ginger, peeled and grated 1 tsp sesame oil 60ml
  soy sauce 60ml Shaoxing rice wine, or mirin 2 tbsp maple syrup 1 tbsp chilli
  sauce, such as sambal oelek or sriracha 2kg chicken wings 6 spring onions,
  trimmed and sliced 1 long red chilli, sliced 30g toasted sesame seeds For the
  ketchup 1kg plums, stoned and coarsely chopped 1 red onion, peeled and finely
  chopped 1 star anise 1 cinnamon stick 4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly
  sliced 4cm piece ginger, peeled and grated 100g soft brown sugar 100ml
  white-wine vinegar 60ml soy sauce 2 tsp Chinese five-spice Heat the oven to
  180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line two baking trays with greaseproof paper.
  In a large bowl, stir the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice wine,
  maple syrup and chilli sauce until well combined. Add the chicken wings, toss
  to coat, then cover and refrigerate for at least an hour, or overnight.
  Meanwhile, make the ketchup. Put the plums, onion, star anise, cinnamon,
  garlic, ginger, sugar, vinegar and soy sauce in a large saucepan on a
  medium-high heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until soft.
  Add the five-spice and simmer, stirring frequently, for 20-25 minutes, until
  the mix thickens. Fish out and discard the star anise and cinnamon, then puree
  the sauce with a stick blender until smooth and transfer to a serving bowl (or
  decant into a sterilised jar or bottle, seal and store in the fridge, where it
  will keep for three months). Transfer the wings to the lined trays and bake
  for 40-45 minutes, turning once halfway, until cooked through and nicely
  golden brown. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle over the spring onions,
  chilli and toasted sesame seeds, then serve with the ketchup. Sweet and sour
  pork with plums Plums bring just the right amount of sweetness and tartness to
  this Chinese-inspired dish that’s perfect for serving with noodles or sticky
  rice. Prep 20 min Marinate 4 hr+ Cook 45 min Serves 4 1 tsp Chinese five-spice
  2 tsp light soy sauce 2 tsp Shaoxing rice wine 30g ginger, peeled and grated
  450g pork fillet or shoulder, trimmed and cut into 3cm chunks 600ml sunflower
  oil 1 egg, beaten 75g cornflour 1 large red onion, peeled and cut into 2cm
  chunks 1 red and 1 yellow pepper, stalks, seeds and pith discarded, flesh cut
  into 2cm chunks 1 large carrot, thinly sliced on the diagonal 600g plums,
  stoned and cut into bite-sized wedges 6 spring onions, greens from 3 finely
  sliced, the rest sliced into 4cm batons 2 red chillies, thinly sliced on the
  diagonal 4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped Egg noodles or rice, to
  serve (optional) For the sweet-and-sour sauce 150ml chicken stock 1 tbsp
  sriracha 50ml tomato ketchup 2 tbsp clear honey 1 tbsp rice vinegar 2 tbsp
  light soy sauce 1 tsp dark soy sauce ½ tsp sesame oil 1 tsp cornflour Start by
  marinating the pork. In a large bowl, combine the five-spice, light soy sauce,
  rice wine and ginger, then add the pork and toss to coat evenly. Cover and
  chill for at least four hours, or overnight. For the sauce, put all the
  ingredients except the cornflour in a small saucepan, whisk to combine and
  bring to a boil. Take off the heat and set aside. Line a plate with kitchen
  paper, then heat the oil in a wok (filling it by no more than half) to 180C
  (if you don’t have a digital probe thermometer, drop in a cube of bread– if it
  turns golden in 30 seconds, the oil is hot enough). Take the pork out of the
  fridge and mix in the beaten egg. Put the cornflour in a large bowl, add the
  pork (discard the excess marinade) and toss to coat. Working in two or three
  batches, deep-fry the pork for three to four minutes, turning halfway, until
  browned and crisp, then use a slotted spoon carefully to transfer it to the
  paper-lined plate. Carefully pour all but a tablespoon of the oil in the wok
  into a heatproof container (leave it to cool, then discard). Set the wok on a
  high heat, then stir-fry the red onion, peppers, carrot, plums and spring
  onion batons for five minutes, until just becoming tender but still with some
  bite. Add the chillies and garlic, stir-fry for a minute more, until fragrant,
  then pour in the sweet-and-sour sauce and leave it to come to a bubble. In a
  small bowl, mix a teaspoon of cornflour with a tablespoon of water, then
  gradually stir this into the wok to thicken the sauce. Add the drained fried
  pork, heat through for a minute or two, then scatter with the shredded spring
  onion greens and serve immediately with noodles or rice. Chai milk creme
  caramel with tea-poached plums These plums are just as wonderful eaten with
  thick yoghurt for a quick dessert or breakfast. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 15 min,
  plus cooling Infuse 1 hr+ Makes 6 For the caramel 100ml water 150g caster
  sugar For the set custard 5 green cardamom pods, bruised 1 tsp fennel seeds 3
  cloves 1 stick cinnamon 1 tsp loose black tea leaves, or 1 teabag 200ml whole
  milk 350ml double cream 2 eggs, plus 4 yolks, beaten 75g caster sugar For the
  plums 1 teabag 1 star anise 1 cinnamon quill 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways
  and the seeds scraped out 150g caster sugar 500g plums, halved and stoned To
  make the caramel, put the water and sugar in a pan and heat gently until the
  sugar dissolves, swirling and titling the pan to help it along. Keep heating
  until the mix turns a deep brown, then pour into six ramekins, tilting to coat
  the bases and sides evenly. Set aside to cool and set. Heat the oven to 140C
  (120C fan)/275F/gas 1. Put the spices, tea, milk and cream in a saucepan,
  bring to a simmer, then take off the heat and leave to cool and infuse for one
  to two hours. In a bowl, whisk the whole eggs, egg yolks and sugar. Slowly
  whisk in the infused cream, pouring it in through a strainer, then discard the
  solids. Put the ramekins in a roasting pan and pour in the custard. Fill the
  roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the
  ramekins, bake for an hour, then remove and leave to cool. Once cold,
  refrigerate the creme caramels until needed. Meanwhile, poach the plums. Tip
  the sugar into a pan with 200ml water, the tea and the spices, and heat gently
  until the sugar dissolves. Add the plums, bring to a boil, then turn down to a
  simmer and cook for five to 10 minutes, until the fruit is tender (this will
  depend on the plums’ ripeness). Take off the heat, leave to cool completely,
  then fish out and discard the spices and teabag. When you are ready to serve,
  briefly dip the base of each ramekin into hot water to loosen the creme
  caramel, then invert each one on to individual plates. Serve with the poached
  plums. • This article was amended on 14 August 2025 to clarify the quantity of
  caster sugar used in the tea-poached plums, it is 150g (an earlier version
  included two entries for caster sugar of 100g and 150g).
