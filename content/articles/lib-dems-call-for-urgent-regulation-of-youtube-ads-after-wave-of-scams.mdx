  The Liberal Democrats are calling for urgent regulation of YouTube advertising
  after scams including deepfakes, impersonated public figures and fraudulent
  investment claims were found to be spreading on the platform with little
  oversight. The party said YouTube’s adverts remain largely unchecked by
  independent regulators, despite new data from Ofcom showing the platform has
  overtaken ITV in weekly UK viewership and continues to dominate children’s
  media consumption. Among the recent scams onYouTube was a series of ads using
  an AI-generated voice and likeness of the consumer champion Martin Lewis to
  promote a cryptocurrency scheme, despite Lewis having no involvement. The
  videos, which have drawn thousands of complaints on Reddit and X, mislead
  users into thinking they are receiving financial advice from a trusted source.
  Other viewers have reported false product claims, scam diet pills and fake
  competitions. In one Reddit thread users reported being targeted with ads
  impersonating UK media figures or pretending to offer government-backed
  grants, with little clarity over how to report or block such content. YouTube
  adverts fall under the same Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) rules as TV,
  but unlike broadcasters, there is no pre-approval, real-time scrutiny or
  independent enforcement unless someone complains. The ASA has previously
  warned of a rise in “celebrity deepfake” and “impersonation” scams on online
  platforms, particularly for financial services. The lack of mandatory
  pre-approval or independent enforcement means that many of these adverts
  remain online for days before action is taken, if any is. Max Wilkinson, the
  Liberal Democrats’ spokesperson for culture, media and sport, said the system
  leaves the public exposed. “We cannot allow a two-tier system where
  traditional broadcasters face robust scrutiny, while a digital giant like
  YouTube is allowed to mark its own homework,” he said. The party is calling
  for YouTube advertising to be brought into line with the system used for TV
  and radio, including tougher oversight, clearer accountability, and the power
  for Ofcom to levy fines on platforms that repeatedly allow harmful or
  misleading ads. It also wants revenues from those fines used to support
  victims of online scams. YouTube ads are served through Google Ads and are
  regulated under a voluntary framework created by the tech industry. This
  contrasts with the ASA’s co-regulatory model for broadcast advertising, where
  Ofcom retains backstop powers and many adverts must be pre-cleared before
  airing. Privately, some Labour MPs acknowledge that online ad regulation is
  “behind the curve”, but there is little appetite for major change. Others have
  warned that new restrictions could make it harder to target voters aged under
  35, many of whom are disengaged from traditional media. Last month the
  Guardian revealed that Ofcom is preparing to push for new legal powers to
  require platforms like YouTube to give greater prominence to public service
  content, amid concerns that trusted news, children’s programming and
  UK-produced shows are becoming “invisible” to younger viewers. The Lib Dems
  argue that the same logic should apply to advertising, especially given the
  rise in misleading financial content and impersonation scams. “YouTube is no
  longer a niche platform – it’s one of the main ways people of all ages consume
  news, entertainment and information,” said Wilkinson. “The government needs to
  act now to ensure that consumers are properly protected.” A YouTube
  spokesperson said: “YouTube is not a broadcaster and it should not be
  regulated like one. “We have strict policies that govern the ads on our
  platform which we enforce rigorously. When we find ads that breach our
  policies we take immediate action, including removing the ads and suspending
  the account when necessary.”
