  The sudden AI cooling-off period Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Drive down
  the 280 freeway in San Francisco and you might believe AI is everywhere, and
  everything. Nearly every billboard advertises an AI related product: “We’ve
  Automated 2,412 BDRs.” “All that AI and still no ROI?” “Cheap on-demand GPU
  clusters.” It’s hard to know if you’re interpreting the industry jargon
  correctly while zooming past in your vehicle. The signs are just one example
  of the tech industry’s en-masse pivot to AI, a technology that the executives
  who have the most to gain from it say will be universe-shifting, inevitable
  and unavoidable. In California’s tech heartland, every company is now an AI
  company, just like every company became a tech company sometime in the 2010s.
  But just beneath the surface of the breathless promotion of every startup’s AI
  prowess, cracks are beginning to appear. Some of AI’s biggest boosters, such
  as OpenAI’s Sam Altman, have warned that investors are overvaluing the
  potential returns on AI. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are
  overexcited about AI?” Altman said at a private dinner with reporters. “My
  opinion is yes.” Altman’s statements coincided with a concession that OpenAI
  botched the roll-out of the latest ChatGPT model – which he once promised
  would be a significant improvement over the current GPT 4.5 model. Sure,
  Altman’s comments may have been geared at getting investors to consider not
  investing in his competitors. But there are other signs. Just this past week,
  a new study from MIT found that 95% of generative AI projects have delivered
  little to no growth in revenue. And tech stocks of companies with huge AI
  pushes tumbled this week: Palantir saw a 9% drop in shares, Oracle saw a 5.8%
  drop, chipmaker Nvidia fell 3.5% and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices as well
  as semiconductor designer Arm each saw 5% or more drop in shares. Not even the
  possibility of lower interest rates, which buoyed stocks in other sectors last
  week, was enough to turn around tech’s market slide. Just beneath the
  breathless promotion of AI, cracks are beginning to appear Even Meta, which
  had been reportedly spending billions to recruit the top AI talent, announced
  an AI hiring freeze. Meta sought to downplay the news, with the company’s
  chief AI officer Alexandr Wang posting on X last week: “We are truly only
  investing more and more into Meta Superintelligence Labs as a company. Any
  reporting to the contrary of that is clearly mistaken.” The sudden AI
  cooling-off period comes just a week after many of these companies reported
  largely stellar earnings despite upping their expectation for how many
  billions they plan to spend on building out their AI capacity over the next
  few months and years. At the same dinner with reporters, Altman said he
  expects OpenAI to spend “trillions” on data center expansion in the “not very
  distant future”, according to the Verge. While the latest round of AI jitters
  is being framed as a sign that the AI hype bubble may soon burst, it’s perhaps
  more of a needed market correction – a reality check for investors who can’t
  see outside of the Silicon Valley echo chamber. Even former Google CEO Eric
  Schmidt warns that some of the laser focus on achieving artificial general
  intelligence – or the idea that AI could at some point match or surpass human
  intelligence – is misguided. “It is uncertain how soon artificial general
  intelligence can be achieved,” reads a column Schmidt co-wrote with China and
  AI policy lead Selina Xu. “We worry that Silicon Valley has grown so enamored
  with accomplishing this goal that it’s alienating the general public and,
  worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already
  exists.” Schmidt and Xu spend much of the rest of the column boosting the
  benefits and milestones AI has already met but raise concerns about how the
  build-at-all-costs strategy Silicon Valley is taking in pursuit of a super
  intelligent AI is not reflective of the reality for the general public.
  “There’s a widening schism between the technologists who feel the A.G.I. – a
  mantra for believers who see themselves on the cusp of the technology – and
  members of the general public who are skeptical about the hype and see A.I. as
  a nuisance in their daily lives,” they wrote. It’s unclear if the industry
  will take heed of these warnings. Investors look to every quarterly earnings
  report for signs that each company’s billions in capex spending is somehow
  being justified and executives are eager to give them hope. Boosting, boasting
  about and hyping the supposed promise and inevitability of AI is a big part of
  keeping investor concerns about the extra $10bn each company adds to its
  spending projections every quarter at bay. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance,
  recently said in the future if you’re not using AI glasses you’ll be at a
  cognitive disadvantage much like not wearing corrective lenses. That means
  tech firms such as Meta and Google will likely continue making the AI features
  that they offer today an almost inescapable part of using their products in a
  play to boost their training data and user numbers. That said, the first big
  test of this AI reality check will come on Wednesday when chipmaker Nvidia –
  one of the building blocks of most LLMs – will report its latest earnings.
  Analysts seem pretty optimistic but after a shaky week for its stocks,
  investor reactions to Nvidia’s earnings and any updates on spending will be a
  strong signal of whether they have a continued appetite for the AI hype
  machine. Have you bonded with an AI? Heavy ChatGPT users have formed strong
  emotional attachments to the AI, which means that, when it changes, they
  notice. In the case of OpenAI’s most recent update, the release of the AI
  model GPT-5, these users got upset. My colleague Dani Anguiano reports: “It
  was really horrible, and it was a really tough time,” said Linn Vailt, a
  software developer in Sweden, about the update. “It’s like somebody just moved
  all of the furniture in your house.” ChatGPTquickly made adjustments,
  promising an update to 5’s personality and restoring access to older models –
  for subscribers only – while acknowledging it had underestimated the
  importance of some features to its users. *** Have you bonded with an AI? We

  reports: TikTok has put hundreds of UK content moderators’ jobs at risk, even
  as tighter rules come into effect to stop the spread of harmful material
  online. The viral video app said several hundred jobs in its trust and safety
  team could be affected in the UK, as well as south and south-east Asia, as
  part of a global reorganisation. In September, the company fired its entire
  team of 300 content moderators in the Netherlands. In October, it then
  announced it would replace about 500 content moderation employees in Malaysia
  as part of its shift towards AI. Last week, TikTok workers in Germany held
  strikes over layoffs in its trust and safety team, also the intended target of
  layoffs. Read the full story: Hundreds of TikTok UK moderator jobs at risk
  despite new online safety rules The cuts are part of a global push by the
  company towards moderating content with artificial intelligence. Automated
  systems already carry out some 85% of content removals on the app, according
  to TikTok. ByteDance, its parent company, seems to want to move the percentage
  upward. The company is not hemming and hawing about the importance of human
  oversight and insight into thorny issues. Business is booming, with a 38%
  increase in revenue in the UK and Europe, per regulatory filings. American
  tech giants are moving in the same direction, led by Meta’s disbandment of its
  fact-checking initiatives and Elon Musk’s deep cuts to the trust and safety
  teams at X. TikTokhas carried out smaller-scale layoffs of trust and safety
  teams in the United States. There have not been mass firings of content
  moderators. Why? Perhaps because any move that might elicit backlash would be
  dangerous at a moment when the official US attitude toward the app couldn’t be
  less clear. The White House created a TikTok account that launched last
  Tuesday. You may recall that the past two American presidents have tried to
  shut the app out of the US. The ban is still in place, held off only by flimsy
  executive orders extending a pause on its enforcement, which may only persist
  as long as Donald Trump’s goodwill does. The wider TechScape Wired and
