  A shake-up of New Zealand’s curriculum has resulted in Māori words being
  scrapped from a selection of books used to teach five-year-olds and a decision
  not to reprint a well-loved book for young readers because it contained too
  many Māori words. The changes have sparked widespread criticism from
  academics, teachers and authors, who have called it “an assault” on Māori
  identity and the latest in the coalition government’s efforts to prioritise
  English over the Indigenous language – criticisms the education minister has
  strongly rejected. What has changed in the curriculum? In 2024, education
  minister Erica Stanford announced she was implementing a “structured literacy
  approach” to reading, which teaches children to read by using sounds and
  phonics to understand words. Part of that change has resulted in a decision to
  cut Māori words – except for characters’ names – from any new books in the
  education ministry’s Ready to Read Phonics Plus series – a series of 78 books
  provided to primary schools. The move affects 12 new books, and has resulted
  in the decision not to reprint the small take-home-version of At the Marae, a
  well-known early reader book that teaches children about visiting traditional
  Māori meeting grounds. The book will instead be printed in full-size format
  for teachers to read aloud in class because it contains six Māori words – some
  of which could be hard for children to decode, the education ministry told the
  Guardian. The ministry also said while its new books in its early reader
  series will not contain Māori words, except for names, some existing titles
  will retain Māori words. What is the rationale for scrapping Māori words? The
  decision to remove the Māori words was driven by concern that incorporating
  Māori words into English texts could be confusing for children learning to
  read English, according to an education ministry report to Stanford in
  October. “Introducing different orthographies simultaneously could lead to
  confusion for learners, making it more difficult for them to master English
  phonetics within these crucial early years of school,” the report noted in its
  advice. However, it went on to say the evidence of this was “mixed” and
  “uncertain”. In hand-written notes on the report, the minister said the
  government had made “a real commitment” to invest in Māori language books and
  that “language revitalisation is so important”. She said Māori language
  schools and teachers had told her they did not want English language in the
  Māori language “decodable” books – texts designed for children to practise
  decoding sounds and letters – and it would be “consistent to keep to one
  language only” in the very early decodable books. The ministry said “all
  words, including English words, in these early readers are very tightly
  controlled to make sure they are decodable for students”. Why have the changes
  sparked criticism? Principals, academics and authors have criticised the
  decision, saying it undermines the place of the Indigenous language and
  children’s ability to learn both English and Māori. “It’s not only harmful
  from a cultural identity perspective, but it also gives very little faith in
  our children that they can grasp these very few, simple words,” said Dr Awanui
  Te Huia, associate professor at Victoria University of Wellington’s Māori
  studies department, Te Kawa a Māui. Te Huia said Māori children face barriers
  attending Māori-immersion preschools and schools due to lengthy waitlists, so
  most end up going into mainstream education. “The very limited opportunities
  that they have to see the language, to see themselves thrive, is being further
  reduced by advice that I don’t see as being evidence based,” she said. The
  minister’s argument that Māori experts did not want English in their text and
  therefore, Māori should be limited in English texts, was drawing a false
  equivalence between the status of the two languages, Te Huia said. “We need to
  create some boundaries around how much English – the dominant language – is
  put into that very limited space where you’re exposed to [Māori] language.” In
  a statement, the Māori principals association, Te Akatea, said it was outraged
  and disappointed at the decision to not reprint the small versions of At the
  Marae. “This decision is a direct attack on our language, a dismissal of our
  culture, and an assault on our identity as Māori,’ it said, adding that books
  like At the Marae expose the 97% of Māori children in English-medium schools,
  and many non-Māori to the language. “These are acts of racism, cultural
  suppression and are deliberate attempts to recolonise our education system.”
  Stanford declined the Guardian’s request for comment but in interviews with
  other media has rejected any claims her policy is an attack on the language.
  The education ministry told the Guardian it “firmly rejects claims made by
  some commentators that this decision is about race” and the decision was
  “grounded in evidence”. The ministry said it had also, for the first time,
  offered all schools a complete set of Māori decodable books. Since taking
  office, the coalition government has minimised Māori language use in the
  public service and ushered in sweeping rollbacks to policies designed to
  improve Māori health and wellbeing. The rationale behind many of the
  government’s proposals is to end “race-based” policies and the coalition has
  said it is committed to improving outcomes for Māori and all New Zealanders.
  But Te Huia says New Zealand’s position as a “global leader” in language
  revitalisation was at stake, and “government push back” on the language had
  resulted in its stagnation. Principals’ Federation president Leanne Otene told
  RNZ it felt like New Zealand “was deliberately going backwards”. “It’s not
  just one book, it’s part of a concerning pattern of removing te reo Māori
  [Māori language] from government services across the board,” she said. “Our
  children are growing up watching their government treat te reo Māori as less
  important.”
