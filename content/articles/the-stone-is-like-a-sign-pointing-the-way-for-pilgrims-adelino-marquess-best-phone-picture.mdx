  Adelino Marques was taking a morning walk on the coast near his holiday home
  in Moledo, north-west Portugal, when he took this image. “It’s the
  northernmost beach in Portugal and is considered one of the most beautiful in
  the country,” Marques says. “It also has two unique features: a fort in the
  middle of the sea, which served as a defence against various attacks over the
  centuries and is now a national monument, and the hill you can see in the
  background of this image, Monte de Santa Tecla. It’s in the neighbouring
  country of Spain, but is nevertheless an icon of this beach.” In the
  foreground of the image is a rock that echoes the shape of the hill, with a
  stone “placed atop in a way that would seem impossible. Pilgrims pass through
  this area every day to walk to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, a pilgrimage
  that covers around 500 miles [805km] and takes about a month to complete. The
  stone is like a sign, like a small mound pointing as if to say ‘That way’.”
  Marques says that, since the 1970s, he has developed his own film negatives in
  a darkroom at his home in Gondomar, just outside central Porto. He thinks this
  has given him a preference for black-and-white images, no matter how they’re
  created. In this instance, he used the Hipstamatic app on his iPhone to apply
  a monochrome filter. “It allows me to better contrast the light and shapes,”
  Marques says. “Colour can be distracting. This filter helped to convey the
  serenity and resilience of the pilgrims who pass this way.”
