  from Reform?

  Good morning. Parliament has returned from its summer recess. MPs are filing
  back into those hallowed halls to resume the business of running the country.
  Have you missed them? Judging by polling on trust in politicians, the answer
  from many of you is likely a resounding no. For most MPs, the summer recess is
  a chance to pause and reset. Not so for Reform UK. The insurgent party, which
  has just four MPs, spent the summer working the country like it was in the
  middle of a general election campaign. It has been hard to escape Nigel Farage
  (pictured top) and Reform: the party has held at least five press conferences
  since recess began (with another scheduled for today). There has also been a
  flurry of statements and open letters, and record-breaking polling to top it
  all off. Reform returns to parliament riding high. The ball is now in Labour’s
  court. With a packed autumn schedule, the government has an opportunity to
  reset the news cycle and seize the political agenda. But, just because it can,
  does not mean that it will. Labour has been widely criticised for failing to
  articulate a message that cuts through in its first year in power. Can that
  change this autumn? What challenges lie ahead and where might the party
  finally break through? To explore all this and more, I spoke to the Guardian’s
  political editor, Pippa Crerar. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories
  Afghanistan | At least 250 people were dead and hundreds more injured in a
  magnitude 6 earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan
  border. The quake was centred 27km north-east of the city of Jalalabad.
  Israel-Gaza war | Israeli airstrikes and gunfire killed at least 18 people in
  and around Gaza City, local health authorities said, as Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  security cabinet prepared to discuss plans to seize the city. Conservatives |
  Doubts have surfaced over Kemi Badenoch’s claim to have been offered a place
  at a prestigious US medical school at 16, with admissions staff unable to
  recall the proposal and the university not providing the course. UK news | A
  police officer was allegedly punched in the face and four people were arrested
  at an anti-immigration protest march in London on Sunday. Heart disease |
  Doctors have found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart
  attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform health guidelines
  worldwide. In depth: ‘Ultimately, the buck stops with the person at the top’
  Labour did not head into summer recess from a position of strength. The party
  was forced into a humiliating retreat over its welfare reform bill after a
  dramatic backbench rebellion. After weeks of bruising infighting, many in
  Labour felt the summer break offered a chance to cool tempers and rethink.
  They may come to regret that. “They could have managed to allow everyone a
  break without vacating the public arena for Reform and they may rue the day
  that they allowed Reform to set the agenda,” Pippa Crerar told me. “It makes
  it harder now to refute the claims that they don’t have a grip on migration
  and it means that they have to think quite carefully about how to get back on
  to the front foot.” Still, the Labour government is determined to wrest back
  control, and they will have plenty of opportunity to do so: with a packed
  autumn of domestic challenges and international crises, the public will be
  looking to hear directly from those in power. “Whether they managed to get the
  positive message that they want to get across is a totally different question
  and obviously a much harder feat. People I’ve spoken to in Downing Street and
  in government suggest that they understand they need to do that, and there’s a
  degree of frustration that delivery’s not fast enough and the messaging isn’t
  coherent enough,” Pippa said. There has been a flurry of reports that Keir
  Starmer (pictured above) is preparing a minor reshuffle of his government,
  alongside changes to his Downing Street team. “Ultimately, the buck stops with
  the person at the top,” Pippa said. “And if the person at the top isn’t able
  to articulate why they want to be in government and what they want to achieve
  in a way that resonates with ordinary people, it’s a struggle.” So what
  problems lie ahead for the government, at home and on the international stage?
  *** The domestic challenges … Recent polling makes for an uncomfortable read
  for Labour supporters. The party enjoyed little in the way of a honeymoon
  period, with figures showing its ratings have fallen further in the first 10
  months of government than those of any other party in modern history. But
  Pippa told me that the polling, which has been brutal for the Conservatives as
  well, shows widespread discontent with mainstream politics generally. “Reform
  is doing so well because it capitalises on that discontent, it becomes a
  vehicle for the disillusionment which many people have in the mainstream
  political parties,” Pippa said. “And Farage is an extraordinary communicator
  who manages to tap into people’s fears, just as he did with Brexit, to provide
  answers that I would argue exacerbates them, particularly with migration.” On
  migration, Labour are breathing a sigh of relief to have won an appeal to
  continue using hotels to house asylums seekers, but the fight is far from
  over. The party are working to reduce the asylum backlog, having announced
  their agreement of a one in, one out deal with the French, but it’s slow work,
  Pippa explained. For MPs in marginal seats, particularly around the “red
  wall”, they fear migration is the issue that could cost them unless the
  government is tougher. The European convention on human rights (ECHR) is the
  new battleground, with Farage describing it as such. “Downing Street has made
  it absolutely clear that the UK was not going to leave the ECHR, because it
  would be hugely problematic for things like trade deals and, crucially, the
  Good Friday agreement,” Pippa said. But the government has announced a review
  of article 8 (respect for your private and family life) of the EHRC and
  possibly article 3 (protecting you from torture and inhuman or degrading
  treatment or punishment), as there are arguments that their scope is too wide
  and they are preventing the deportation of convicted foreign criminals.
  There’s a broader debate on whether the UK should work with European Union
  member states on more general reforms of the ECHR as a whole. The other big
  domestic challenge is the economy. “Rachel Reeves is ending the summer in a
  worse position than she started,” Pippa said, with inflation remaining high,
  many still struggling with the cost of living crisis, and the Office for
  Budget Responsibility now thinking of revising its forecast in light of an
  outdated measure of productivity. “The problem it creates for Reeves, and the
  reason I think we are likely to see the budget potentially pushed back into
  November from October, is that they’re trying to work out the communications
  on it. They have boxed themselves in. They said that they are not going to
  borrow any more and they said that they don’t want to be a government that
  cuts spending. Well, that only leaves them with tax rises,” Pippa said. *** …
  And the international upheavals The problem for Starmer is that his
  international popularity isn’t translating much domestically. But why is his
  reputation better among international audiences? Pippa told me Starmer has
  built a reputation for being effective in difficult situations with
  international partners. “The big international moment coming up in the next
  month is Donald Trump’s state visit. And, as we saw when Trump was on a
  holiday in Scotland, he has this capacity to whirl into town and stir
  everything up and then disappear again. He’s a very unpredictable president,”
  Pippa said. Despite Trump’s promises to end the war in Ukraine, Russian
  president Vladimir Putin has continued ordering attacks (including a deadly
  assault on Kyiv last week). And the Alaska summit didn’t deliver what Ukraine
  and its European partners wanted, Pippa said. On Gaza, Starmer has promised to
  recognise Palestine as a state, after being urged to do so by his cabinet and
  the wider Labour movement. But as the devastation continues in Gaza and the
  siege is tightened across the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories,
  pressure grows on Starmer to go further, with growing calls for further
  sanctions. “They’ve already sanctioned the two far right members of Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s cabinet. We could well see more to come,” Pippa said. “The
  government has certainly indicated that they would be prepared to take further
  steps and sanction not only just politicians but also senior Israeli military,
  if they think that they’ve been directly responsible for some of their
  atrocities in Gaza.” *** An existential moment for Keir Starmer Starmer
  clearly drew out the battle line when he labelled Reform as the main
  opposition to his government. But over the last few months there has been a
  real risk of Starmer being defined by Farage. So how will Labour respond? “The
  big danger is that personal attacks on Farage put the spotlight on him and
  give him a platform. By defining him as the opposition, it cuts the Tories off
  at the knees, but it also risks putting Reform UK in a better position,” Pippa
  said. “If the government sees Reform as a potential government in waiting,
  then presumably the public may as well.” And we saw this summer what happens
  when Farage is left unchallenged. “They will take the fight to him.,” Pippa
  said of Labour. But whether they do that by moving in to Reform UK’s terrain,
  or by managing to make the case for their own agenda based on Labour values
  and on what Starmer believes in will be the interesting thing to watch, she
  added. The problem for voters is that many just don’t know what the PM stands
  for. “Starmer has struggled to articulate what he believes in, so this is an
  existential moment if they can’t turn the tide away from Reform UK and can’t
  convince people that Labour can actually deliver,” Pippa said, pointing to
  next May’s local elections, as well as votes in Wales and Scotland, as
  critical moments. And, by next summer, Labour will be halfway through its
  parliamentary term. But, Pippa added, Reform’s lead in the polls does not make
  an election win a foregone conclusion, and Labour still have time on their
  side. She described Reform’s policies as vague and contradictory. While Farage
  has been able to capitalise on exploiting social and racial divisions, many
  British people may not feel comfortable with the direction he represents. “We
  live in incredibly volatile times,” Pippa said, “But it does definitely still
  feel like there’s everything to play for for Labour”. What else we’ve been

  days worthwhile. One way to make the days full of joy is through playful
