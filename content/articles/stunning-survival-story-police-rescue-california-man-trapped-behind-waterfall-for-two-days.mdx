  A California man who recently became trapped behind a waterfall for two days
  while climbing was dramatically rescued by police utilizing a helicopter. Ryan
  Wardwell, 46, of Long Beach, went to waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups on
  10 August with plans to rappel down, the sheriff’s office of Tulare county
  said in a social media post. But the “extreme hydraulics” of the waterfalls
  pushed Wardwell off his rappelling lines and trapped him behind a cascade of
  the Kern river, according to the sheriff’s office. His failure to return to
  his car that night prompted local law enforcement to spend 11 August searching
  for him with infrared technology and aircraft. Difficult terrain and fading
  daylight thwarted their efforts that day. But rescuers found Wardwell the next
  day after flying a drone behind the cascade in question. Wardwell was alive
  and conscious when rescuers spotted him, and he told them how he had become
  stranded there, the Tulare county sheriff’s office said. A California highway
  patrol helicopter crew then managed to hoist him to safety to cap off what the
  sheriff’s office declared a “stunning survival story”. Wardwell received
  treatment for dehydration and “only minor injuries”, and he was reunited with
  family who had gone to the scene, the sheriff’s office said. The agency
  published video of Wardwell’s rescue on Facebook, where it captured attention
  from news media outlets that reported on the situation. The clip showed the
  helicopter whipping around foliage and water around the cascade before the
  crew lifted Wardwell onboard. An attraction for hiking and outdoors adventure
  enthusiasts, the Seven Teacups are in a secluded area about two hours south of
  the Sequoia national park, which itself is east of Visalia, California.
  Wardwell had rappelled the falls several times before, the San Francisco
  Chronicle reported. On his 10 August trip there, friends had accompanied him,
  though they opted to stop going further after seeing the rushing water’s
  power, Mike Crane, a California highway patrol flight officer paramedic, told
  the Chronicle. According to the outlet, Wardwell’s friends left a note on his
  car telling passersby to report him missing if the vehicle was still there the
  next day, which it was. Wardwell ended up nestling himself in a dark cave
  beneath the waterfall – completely soaked – after being thrust off his rappel
  lines, the Chronicle added. Tulare county sheriff’s office captain, Kevin
  Kemmerling, told the Chronicle that Wardwell fought to escape for two days,
  “but there was nothing he could do to break through”. “There was no way for
  him to warm up or dry out in there, so it had to have been miserable,”
  Kemmerling said to the newspaper. Kemmerling told the NBC affiliate in Fresno,
  California, that three people drowned in that area in August 2024. Crane,
  speaking to the Chronicle, added: “I got the impression that maybe he didn’t
  know if he was ever going to get out of there.” The Tulare sheriff’s office
  said in its statement that it reminded members of the public “to always be
  aware of their environment and capabilities, especially when navigating white
  water rivers” like the one at the Seven Teacups. “Stay safe, stay smart and
  stay alive,” the statement from the sheriff’s office said.
