  A lawyer for Jimmy Lai has argued that it is not wrong to support freedom of
  expression, as he began his final argument in the prominent Hong Kong
  democracy activist and newspaper founder’s landmark national security trial.
  The barrister Robert Pang is representing Lai in his fight against charges of
  colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring
  with others to issue seditious publications. Lai, 77, faces up to life in
  prison if convicted under a national security law imposed by Beijing after
  anti-government protests in 2019. “It is not wrong to support freedom of
  expression. It is not wrong to support human rights,” Pang told the
  three-judge panel, which is expected to deliver a verdict later this year,
  once this current round of final legal submissions is concluded after about a
  week. “It is not wrong to try to persuade the government to change its policy.
  Nor is it wrong not to love a particular administration or even the country,
  because … you can’t force someone to think in one way or another,” Pang added.
  One of the judges, Esther Toh, said that this was not what the prosecution
  argued. “It’s not wrong not to love the government, but if you do that by
  certain nefarious means, then it’s wrong,” Toh said. Prosecutors say Lai used
  his media outlet and foreign political connections to lobby for governments to
  impose sanctions and other punitive measures against Chinese and Hong Kong
  authorities. In his closing argument earlier on Wednesday, the prosecutor
  Anthony Chau told the court that Lai showed “unwavering intent to solicit
  [sanctions, blockade, or hostile activities] from foreign countries”. “These
  collaborations are long-term and persistent,” Chau added. Closing arguments
  were scheduled to begin last Thursday but the court was delayed by bad weather
  for a day, and then further postponed over health concerns related to Lai’s
  heart. Pang told the court last week that the tycoon had experienced heart
  “palpitation” and episodes that felt like “collapsing” while in jail. Lai
  appeared healthy as he entered the dock on Monday, and he smiled and waved to
  his family at the public gallery. The national security trial has stretched
  for more than 140 days – beyond the 80 originally set down – and years after
  his arrest in 2020. Over three days the prosecution summarised its arguments,
  including that articles published in Lai’s pro-democracy tabloid newspaper,
  Apple Daily, falsely portrayed Chinese authorities as oppressors of Hong Kong
  freedoms, in order to lobby for foreign intervention after the crackdown on
  the pro-democracy movement. Chau told the court the articles published in
  Apple Daily were not “rational criticism”, and that none of them provided
  recommendations, nor did they “venture to suggest any solutions”. He said the
  paper’s criticisms of the Chinese authorities were an indirect means of
  calling on foreign governments to interfere. However, his argument received
  some pushback from the judges overseeing the case, who questioned whether that
  amounted to sedition. “Did they actually have to venture that? You can write a
  critical article about the water problem, but do you have to venture to offer
  solutions?” judge Esther Toh said, appearing to reference a recent issue with
  local drinking water. Judge Alex Lee pointed to Apple Daily articles calling
  for the now-shelved extradition bill – which was the original focus of the
  2019 protests – to be withdrawn, saying: “They were opposing the very
  introduction of the extradition bill … was that not a suggested solution?” Lee
  added that an article could not be considered seditious if its purpose was to
  highlight pitfalls in governance, “but if it was to defame the government
  causing the people to lose confidence or to turn hostile against the
  government, that would be a case of sedition”. Chau said that even after
  Beijing’s national security law in the city was passed, Lai did not stop his
  alleged collaborators, including members of the overseas activist group Stand
  With Hong Kong, which Lai is accused of backing financially, and the
  Interparliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), from continuing to lobby for
  sanctions. Chau said: “Lai knew exactly what Ipac was doing at the time,” and
  that he had maintained ties with current and former US government and military
  officials after the passage of the law. During the trial, prosecutors had
  presented as evidence a network of mostly foreign politicians, including
  Donald Trump, his former vice-president Mike Pence, and senior members of his
  first administration. Taiwan’s former president Tsai Ing-wen and a number of
  UK, US and Taiwan activists, academics, politicians and journalists were also
  listed. In November, Lai told the court he had met some, but he denied asking
  for any concrete action beyond speaking in support of Hong Kong. He said he
  had never met, spoken to or exchanged messages with Trump, but believed the US
  president had been briefed about him. Lai’s defence team’s closing arguments
  are expected to finish early next week, before the three-judge panel retires
  to decide on their ruling. A verdict is expected before November, due to the
  start of another national security trial, but no date is set. The trial of the
  so-called “Hong Kong 47” took more than five months between the end of
  hearings and a verdict, and a further five months for sentencing. Reuters
