  Ish review – Luton-set urban pastoral in which racial profiling pushes teen
  friends apart
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  Artist, musician and film-maker Imran Perretta makes a really impressive
  feature-directing debut here, co-written by him and Enda Walsh, and shot in
  lustrous monochrome by cinematographer Jermaine Canute Edwards. It’s a
  poignant and poetic urban pastoral about young masculinity, Muslim and south
  Asian communities, and the seedy and insidious new petty harassment of racial
  profiling and facial recognition tech. The setting is the streets of Luton and
  the surrounding Bedfordshire woodlands near Wardown Park, under the airport
  flight path – at one stage a plane looms gigantically overhead like an alien
  spaceship – and sometimes beneath the cathedral floodlights of the Luton Town
  football ground, where visiting supporters chant “Luton’s a shithole, I want
  to go home!” (A more comic or sentimentally lenient film might have included a
  scene at the Eric Morecambe statue, but not this one.) In some ways, Ish is a
  parallel and contested coming-of-age narrative about two boys whose diverging
  destinies are shown in the final sequence: they are coming of age, or perhaps
  it is rather that finally only one comes of age. Ishmail, or Ish, played by
  newcomer Farhan Hasnat, is a kid whose mum has just died and who can’t exactly
  process his own emotions or the suppressed emotions of the adults. He lives
  with his grandmother (Sudha Bhuchar), his dad Naeem (Avin Shah), who works at
  the airport, and his exasperated older sister Samira, played by
  singer-songwriter Joy Crookes. But the most important person in Ish’s life is
  his best mate Maram (Yahya Kitana), an older teen whom his grandmother calls
  the “Palestinian boy”. Ish speaks English at home, and with Maram codeswitches
  to roadman-speak as they range far afield together all day long, sometimes
  doing bucolically innocent things such as collecting wild blackberries. The
  older Maram is angrier, warier, more alienated than Ish, and oppressed by his
  own taxi-driver dad. Maram is alive to the possibility of violent clashes with
  his “opps”, whom he calls “the IDF” (news of the Gaza situation is a
  background noise to their lives). Ish is hurt when Maram all but ignores him
  when they run into older, cooler boys at the pool or the fair, but at one
  crucial moment it is Ish who hurts Maram’s feelings – an ugly incident that
  the film shows is a defining moment in their lives. A police facial
  recognition van – apparently unmarked – pulls up behind Ish and Maram for a
  heavy-handed and unwarranted stop and search. The two of them run; Ish gets
  away but Maram is dragged into the van and then without apology turfed out.
  The film shows that Maram is angry with Ish for running away and not facing
  down the law alongside him, but it shows also that he is angry with himself,
  humiliated first by being caught and then by being released. He is a kid, not
  important, not so different in fact from Ish. What do their masculinity and
  their (prospective) adulthood mean now? Perretta conveys that Ish and Maram
  are different personalities, and Ish has the benefit of a close relationship
  with his witty and wise grandmother. But they are also different by virtue of
  arbitrary fate: Maram is older, more set on a certain path. It is a complex,
  compassionate drama. • Ish screened at the Venice film festival.
