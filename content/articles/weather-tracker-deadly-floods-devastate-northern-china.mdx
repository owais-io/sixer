  At least 70 people have died in northern China after another bout of
  torrential rain triggered flooding, the latest in a series of extreme rainfall
  events in recent months. Between 23 and 29 July, Beijing and its surrounding
  areas recorded an average of 166mm, equivalent to the monthly norm. The
  suburban district of Miyun received the highest amount of rainfall, with 543mm
  recorded, equivalent to the region’s annual average. The death toll included
  31 people in a Miyun care home, 10 who were swept away in a minibus in Shanxi
  province, and eight people in a landslide in the city of Chengde. Floods also
  damaged roads and vital infrastructure, cutting off more than 130 rural
  villages and leading to the evacuation of more than 80,000 people from their
  homes. The increasing frequency of high-rainfall events in China has been
  linked to rising global temperatures; each degree in warming enables the
  atmosphere to hold 7% more moisture. Meanwhile, Japan is braced for Tropical
  Storm Krosa on Friday, which is expected to skirt past the south-eastern Kanto
  region via the Izu islands. Although Krosa travelled towards Japan during its
  initial north-westerly path, a forecasted change to a more north-easterly
  direction means the system is likely to avoid a direct hit. However, its close
  proximity to the Chiba region may bring 120-200mm of rain in 24 hours. This
  week, as much of Europe experiences below-average temperatures, parts of
  Scandinavia have been engulfed by unusually intense heat. Prolonged heatwave
  conditions swept the north of the continent in mid-July, driven by
  exceptionally high sea-surface temperatures off Norway’s northern coast and a
  stubborn area of high pressure that brought sunny weather and sinking,
  compressing air. As a result, temperatures in Norway, Sweden and Finland rose
  8-10C (46-40F) above seasonal norms and remained elevated for nearly two
  weeks. The Norwegian counties of Trøndelag and Nordland exceeded 30C for 13
  consecutive days, including in Storforsheia, just north of the Arctic Circle.
  It was the warmest two-week period on record in several areas. In the past
  week, the heat has shifted north and east, easing across much of Norway and
  Sweden and pushing temperatures 10-15C above normal in Finland and
  north-western Russia. Temperatures in the upper 20s celsius are likely to
  persist for at least the next five days several hundred miles north of the
  Arctic Circle. • This article was amended on 6 August 2025. An earlier version
  misspelled the province of Shanxi.
