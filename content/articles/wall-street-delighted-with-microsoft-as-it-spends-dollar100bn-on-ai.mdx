  Microsoft, the world’s second-most valuable company, is dumping enormous sums
  of money into its artificial intelligence efforts. At the same time, the
  company is earning money hand over fist. Investors are thrilled. The
  enterprise software giant reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that exceeded
  expectations on Wednesday as the company races to acquire datacenters and
  talent, which continues to be investigated by investors. The company predicted
  its capital expenditure for the next fiscal year would top $100bn, a 14%
  increase from the year prior. It’s the fifth quarter in a row that Microsoft
  has beaten Wall Street’s expectations. Shares in the company, which is
  celebrating its 50-year anniversary since it was founded by Bill Gates and
  Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in April 1975, are trading a near
  record of $513, up 22% since the start of the year. The software giant’s stock
  rose more than 7% in extended trading on Wednesday. Microsoft, like rivals
  Alphabet/Google and Amazon, is in an all-out race for datacenter capacity to
  meet demand for AI. Last week, Alphabet announced it will spend $85bn in
  capital expenditures in 2025, a $10bn increase on what it estimated at the
  start of the year. Amazon is looking to spend $100bn over the same period.
  “Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every
  industry and sector,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer
  of Microsoft. “We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt
  and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75bn in revenue, up
  34%, driven by growth across all workloads,” Nadella said in a statement.
  Microsoft reported revenue of $76.4bn, against consensus estimates of
  $73.81bn, and earnings per share of $3.65, against estimates of $3.37. That
  corresponds to revenue growth of 18% year-over-year. Revenue in the same
  period a year earlier came in at $64.73bn. The extraordinary spending on data
  centers, necessary to power AI products, comes as companies are increasingly
  outsourcing their computing demands to the cloud. Before the earnings were
  released, Dan Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush said Microsoft was on track
  to $4tn market value “shortly”, and $5tn over the next 18 months as shares
  moving up to $600 as companies accelerate their adoption of AI technologies.
  “This was a slam-dunk quarter for MSFT with cloud and AI driving significant
  business transformation across every sector and industry as the company
  continues to capitalize on the AI Revolution unfolding front and center,” Ives
  said in a statement after Microsoft’s numbers were released. The extraordinary
  cost of hiring top AI talent is also coming into focus. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam
  Altman, has said Meta was offering $100m in signing bonuses to recruit talent
  from his company. Facebook parent Meta also reportedly offered a senior Apple
  engineer $200m to join its “superintelligence” team. Microsoft, meanwhile, is
  reported to be offering high-level engineers a yearly salary of as much as
  $408,000, not including a one-time stock award of as much as $1.9m, plus an
  annual stock award of $1,476,000, according to Business Insider.
