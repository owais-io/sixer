  In a large country school in the rolling Shropshire hills, a group of young
  boys sporting hand-drawn moustaches are proudly selling wares at a pine-cone
  shop they created that morning. Another group of children have taken a picnic
  and gone on an adventure into the woods, while others have gone to the
  swimming pool or to play ballgames on the front lawn. This is one of the
  Active Training and Education Trust (ATE) residential summer camps – they call
  them superweeks – where children from across the country convene for a week of
  fun, adventure, team building and a dose of silliness. Summer camps are at
  risk of dying out in the UK, experts have warned, with rising costs, a lack of
  funding and general wariness among parents about what they entail making it
  harder to keep them going. The Summer Camps Trust, which campaigns to raise
  the profile of summer camps in Britain and train young leaders, has recently
  written to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport asking for summer camps
  to be recognised in its upcoming youth strategy. “We need a grant if possible,
  but with or without that, we need officialdom to say this is a good thing for
  children, some sort of official recognition of what summer camps can do for
  children,” said Chris Green, the coordinator of the charity, which estimates
  only 2% of nine- to 15-year-olds in Britain currently attend them. Summer
  camps are big business in America, where 26 million children and adults take
  part in one annually, and are also common in many European countries. Green
  said summer camps in Britain often only made the news when things went wrong –
  such as when earlier this month a man was arrested for allegedly lacing sweets
  with sedatives at a summer camp in Leicestershire. This did nothing to ease
  parents’ fears about sending their children away for a week, he said. “Parents
  are much more frightened these days of letting children out of their sight, so
  far too many of our kids, in the summer holidays, they’re confined to their
  bedrooms with a laptop because people think they’re safe there,” he said.
  Green has been involved in the movement for British summer camps since the
  1960s, after visiting French colonies de vacances and feeling that British
  children would benefit from the chance to meet people from different areas and
  social classes. “In the world of today, it’s needed even more. Because the
  opportunity to put away your mobile phones and get away from social media, to
  simply be kids, playing in a green space, laughing, having a nice time
  together, is sickeningly rare,” he said. “We’re letting our kids down so badly
  at the moment in this country by not providing that.” At the ATE camp, all
  children hand their phones in at the start of the week, and the focus is on
  creating an “authentic childhood experience” with songs and games, and
  children of all ages mixing together. “Not having a phone means you don’t have
  access to your old life, but you also aren’t aware of who’s got what and who’s
  in what, and who can talk to who,” said Margot Leys, a 24-year-old chef from
  Glasgow. “It makes it feel like we are the only 80 people in the whole world.”
  Leys has trained to become one of the volunteer youth leaders – known as
  monitors – who lead small groups of children for the duration of the week,
  while a broader team including a director, matron and general assistants keep
  the whole show on the road. “There’s a feeling here that’s hard to describe.
  It’s playing, and it’s a place where anyone can be silly. I think it’s really
  nice seeing a bunch of 16-year-olds slowly shed that self-consciousness and
  just let it all go,” Leys said. “It’s such a break from the stress of normal
  life,” said Nina, 15, from London, attending the camp for the fourth time. “I
  get to do stuff that I don’t usually do, and it’s nice just expanding out of
  the little bubble that I live in. “At the beginning, you might feel like, oh,
  I don’t know what I’m going to do without my phone, but there’s so much to do,
  and you sort of forget about your phone, about technology.” The week is less
  about assault courses and wall climbing and more about crafts, games, hot
  chocolates and long walks, with a focus on activities that can easily be
  recreated at home. This helps keep costs down, but this year ATE has had to
  cut its superweeks from eight to seven days to keep the £519 fee the same, and
  it is increasingly difficult to get funding to subsidise places for children
  from disadvantaged backgrounds, who used to make up a third of the attendees.
  ATE uses venues such as boarding schools and outdoor activity and education
  centres, all of which are seeing higher running costs. “We’re the least
  expensive [summer camp] on the market. But now we’ve become a luxury ticket
  item for families and they have to see the benefit of what we do,” said Liz
  Macartney, the managing director of ATE Trust. “There’s lots more competition
  for funding, and it’s often hard to show the benefit of what we do, what
  problems we’re solving. We’re growing children up to be compassionate and
  empathetic, to become really decent lovely human beings interested in other
  people. “We would never make a claim that every child sat at home would
  participate in everything that we do. But we remove those screens and
  pressures, and we make it really clear to them that we don’t know who you are
  at home, if you’re the cool kid, the shy kid, the geeky kid or whatever, so be
  whichever kid you want to be.”
