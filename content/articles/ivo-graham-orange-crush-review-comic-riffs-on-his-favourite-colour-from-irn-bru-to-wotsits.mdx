  With Orange Crush, Ivo Graham promises us either his best ever standup set, or
  a colour-coordinated breakdown. I’m not sure it’s either. Having been asked
  “What’s your favourite colour?” by his six-year-old kid, this show riffs on
  Graham’s fondness for orange – which doesn’t exactly scream standup with
  something essential to say. But he roams around the subject entertainingly
  enough, in an hour addressing Wotsits and Irn-Bru, his mother’s MS and his
  role in the campaign to save Swindon Town football club. Alongside that
  material, Graham is bracingly outspoken on Palestine, to which cause he also
  lends his support. All of which, with his newfound suavity and recent
  rebranding (tongue in cheek or otherwise) as simply “Ivo”, made me wonder:
  whither the shy and self-abasing Graham of yesteryear? It mightn’t have been
  much fun to live, but it was a compelling comic persona – whereas Ivo 2.0, 34
  years old and with a bit of swagger, is harder to grasp. Not that he’s grown
  out of awkwardness. The stories here loop around reveals of Graham’s favourite
  orange things (“It’s time to lift the first cloche of the evening …”), and the
  first finds him banging into an old flame while riding a particularly manky
  Lime bike. In another, his plan is thwarted to pester Nick Hornby at a VIP
  dinner. There are one or two clunky audience interactions, too, that our host
  frets about more than is necessary. On the flipside, a cocky visual gag
  offsets any Orange Order anxieties among the Scottish crowd; and then there’s
  his “I’m the top Ivo” material, comparing himself to his humbler namesakes.
  One such is the rapper Drake (full name: Aubrey Drake Graham), and the comic
  knows well how funny it is for a posh Englishman to implicate himself in
  hip-hop “diss tracks”. His Eton background gives us the show’s funniest gag,
  too, about a careers fair at his former school. Much of what remains prompts
  smiles rather than belly laughs, with his tale of filming a video for his save
  Swindon campaign in particular feeling too many steps removed from the stage.
  It’s not a career best, but there are flashes in this chromatically themed
  outing of Graham in glorious Technicolor. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh,
  until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
