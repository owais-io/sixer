  ‘You’re gonna need a bigger bank account’: how a Jaws child actor turned a
  fleeting appearance into a fortune

  Name: Jeffrey Voorhees. Age: 62. Appearance: Just the one. Occupation: Child
  actor. Pretty old for a child actor. He’s a former child actor. Has he been in
  anything I would have seen? Jaws. Wow. Anything else? No, not really. Oh.
  Well, Jaws is pretty good. I’ve seen it dozens of times. Jeffrey Voorhees will
  be pleased to hear that. Why? Because, despite his very small role as shark
  victim Alex Kintner when he was 12, Voorhees is still being paid residuals –
  royalties – 50 years later. Every time Jaws is on TV, he earns money. Nice
  work if you can get it. “It pays to die,” is how he put it in a recent
  interview with Syfy. Even so, he can’t be pulling in that much after all this
  time. It’s not just residuals. After hiding from fame for years, Voorhees –
  who still lives on Martha’s Vineyard, where Jaws was filmed – has found ways
  to embrace the full earning capacity of his brief turn as victim number two.
  How? By attending fan conventions for “£10,000 a time”, selling autographed
  merch online and making personalised videos on Cameo. People pay him for that?
  It helps that Jaws fans are a little obsessive. One woman brought Voorhees an
  inflatable yellow raft identical to the one on which Alex Kintner met his
  demise. “She was in tears and I signed the raft for her,” he said. That sounds
  more than a little obsessive. He’s even been presented with his old discarded
  royalty statements – bought by fans on eBay for thousands – to sign. “I don’t
  throw them away any more,” he said. Are there any other child actors still
  raking it in after all these years? Yes, if not to the same extent. Jason
  Weaver, who provided the singing voice for young Simba in the original
  animated version of The Lion King, reportedly received, and still receives,
  far more than the $2m (£1.5m) upfront Disney originally offered him before his
  mother insisted on a reduced fee plus royalties from soundtrack sales. Well
  done, Jason’s mum. Are there any more actors with cameos as brief as
  Voorhees’? Casey Margolis, who fleetingly played a young version of Jonah
  Hill’s character in the 2007 film Superbad, recently revealed he’s still
  getting cheques. The kid who draws penises on everything? That’s him. While
  the amounts vary from $10,000 to 12 cents, he reckons he’s collected about
  $100k (£74,000) in total. What a racket! How can I get my kid killed in
  something huge? Actually, that ship has probably sailed. Streaming services
  don’t tend to pay residuals in the same way, as their content is always
  available to watch – and young actors have reported receiving minuscule
  amounts for their work. Do say: “These eye-watering sums are a symptom of how
  out of control fan culture has become.” Don’t say: “You’re gonna need a bigger
  bank account.”
