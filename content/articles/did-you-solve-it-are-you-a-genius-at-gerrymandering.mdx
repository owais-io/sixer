  Earlier today I set three gerrymandering logic puzzles. Here they are again
  with solutions. In each of the grids below, the challenge is to find the
  unique electoral map in which the minority colour wins the most regions. A
  region is defined as a contiguous block of cells that are joined either
  horizontally or vertically. (A region cannot contain any cells that are only
  connected diagonally, i.e. via a corner.) Winning a region means having the
  most cells in that region. To solve using pencil and paper, click here for a
  print out (and some bonus puzzles). To play on your screen, below each puzzle
  is a link to an interactive version. The puzzles were conceived by Brady
  Forrest (aka Deckard). He talks about the maths behind the puzzle (and shows
  how to solve them) in this YouTube clip: All solutions at the bottom. Puzzle
  1: Easy Divide the grid into 5 regions of 5 cells each. Purple, the minority
  colour, must win the majority of regions. Puzzle 2: Medium Divide the grid
  into 5 regions of 10 cells each. Purple, the minority colour, must win the
  majority of regions. No ties allowed in any region. Puzzle 3: Hard Divide the
  grid into 7 regions of 7 cells each. Blue, the minority colour, must win the
  majority of regions. No ties allowed for first place in any region. Solutions
  Thanks to Deckard for sharing his puzzles. Thanks to Starwort for the
  interactive versions. I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays
  since 2015. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to
  suggest one, email me. In other Gerry-related news, here’s a fact from my new
  book, Football School Facts. Gerry Taggart (ex-Bolton) is one of only four
  Premier League players to have been sent off on their birthdays. The wrong
  sort of card! This curio and hundreds of others appear in the book, the latest
  in the long-running series I write with Ben Lyttleton for children aged 7 to
  107. Football School Facts is full-colour, hardback, would make an excellent
  gift, and is available at the Guardian Bookshop.
