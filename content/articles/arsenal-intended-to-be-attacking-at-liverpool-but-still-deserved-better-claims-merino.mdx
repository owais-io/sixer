  claims Merino

  Mikel Merino has insisted that Arsenal did not set out to be cautious in their
  1-0 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday. The midfielder said the team’s desire was
  always to attack but in the face of Liverpool’s threat on transitions, his
  side found the balance difficult to find. Mikel Arteta was criticised for his
  selection, which saw him beef up in the middle with the inclusion of Merino in
  the No 10 role – Martin Ødegaard was fit enough only to be a substitute – and
  also start the new signing, Eberechi Eze, on the bench. The reaction was
  outcome-based. Had Dominik Szoboszlai not located the top corner with a
  30-yard free-kick in the 83rd minute, Arteta would most likely have been
  praised for engineering a fourth successive Premier League draw at Anfield.
  However, Szoboszlai produced a masterpiece and Arsenal departed with regrets.
  They took in the theory that Liverpool might have been vulnerable against
  opponents who attacked with gusto. They had conceded twice in each of their
  previous three matches this season, including the Community Shield against
  Crystal Palace. The champions are bedding in new signings. Arsenal did not put
  it to the test, prioritising control and preventing Liverpool from running at
  them with the ball. The statistics showed Arteta’s team managed only one shot
  on target and had no big chances. That said, Liverpool also created precious
  little and Arteta did introduce Ødegaard and Eze in the 70th minute. The
  visiting manager wanted to push for the win in the closing stages. “The
  mentality is always to go forward, to be attacking, to be aggressive, to try
  to dominate the game and create chances,” Merino said. “But sometimes the game
  of football is like this. Sometimes the ball puts you in a certain situation.
  You have to adapt to it. “Against teams like Liverpool … they are a big threat
  running. We knew that. So we wanted to attack and create chances but at the
  same time they wanted to be low, wait for us to make a mistake and run
  forward. It’s tricky to try to attack, not make mistakes at the same time, and
  create chances.” It was Arsenal’s first loss against a rival from the
  so-called “Big Six” in 23 matches and their first away defeat in the league in
  16. Szoboszlai’s goal was their first they had conceded this season. Merino
  called for perspective and said he retained faith that Arsenal would challenge
  for the title, especially given the range of options open to Arteta after
  £263m was spent on new signings. “The mentality on the team is that we can do
  big things,” Merino said. “We want to take that next step and I think we are
  ready. Games like Liverpool are hard to digest because the feeling was we
  deserved better. “But overall, I’m very excited for this squad; the amount of
  quality we have, the amount of depth we have now. It’s to create the
  relationships with the new guys and everyone needs time to adapt. In the
  future, I think we’re going to be ready.”
