  advertised, new real-world testing shows

  Car companies continue to sell vehicles in Australia that use much more petrol
  and emit more toxic fumes than advertised, despite repeated investigations
  identifying discrepancies in marketing. The Australian Automobile Association
  (AAA) on Wednesday released the latest results from its “real-world” testing
  program, a four-year $14m government-funded scheme that scrutinises claims
  made about vehicles’ fuel consumption and emissions. The country’s peak
  motoring body said it had tested 114 popular cars, vans and utes since the
  program began in August 2023 and found more than 77% of these vehicles used
  more fuel than advertised. In its most recent study, the AAA said 25 of the 30
  cars tested used more petrol than advertised, showing consumers could not rely
  on the fuel consumption and emissions information provided at point of sale.
  Eleven of the cars used 10% or more fuel on the road than they had in the
  manufacturers’ laboratory testing which was used as the basis for advice to
  consumers, the AAA said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Hyundai Kona
  Hybrid recorded the greatest discrepancy – using 5.2 litres per 100km in the
  AAA’s testing on the road, compared with its laboratory result of 3.9 litres
  per 100km – a difference of 33%. Hyundai declined to comment. It was followed
  by the Kia Stonic, which used 26% more fuel on the road; the Hyundai i30
  Hybrid, which used 17%; the Toyota Fortuner, which used 16%; and the Kia
  Sportage Hybrid, which used 14%. Kia was contacted for comment. Toyota
  declined to comment. The AAA said its latest round of testing also found six
  of the 30 vehicles produced noxious emissions above current Australian
  regulatory limits, despite these same vehicle types having met those limits in
  lab tests. These were the Toyota Fortuner, the Suzuki Vitara, the BMW X1, the
  Ford Ranger, the Toyota Hi-Ace LWB and the Toyota Hi-Ace SLWB. BMW and Ford
  were contacted for comment. Suzuki said it was unable to respond by deadline.
  The AAA’s managing director, Michael Bradley, said it was becoming clear
  carmakers continued to optimise their vehicles’ performance for lab testing
  and “too often” overstated their improvements in fuel use and environmental
  performance. “Some vehicles perform as advertised, but most do not,” he said.
  The AAA said its testing program will expand in scope from August when it
  began releasing the results of its electric vehicle testing, checking the
  distance they could travel on a single charge in “real driving conditions”.
  Bradley said “range anxiety” continued to be a significant barrier to the
  uptake of electric vehicles and that the AAA hoped its results would give
  Australians greater confidence in buying this type of car. The organisation
  said “independent, real-world data” was becoming increasingly important, after
  the introduction of the federal government’s national vehicle efficiency
  standard. Introduced by the Albanese government in its first term, the
  standard is designed to bring more fuel-efficient cars into the market by
  penalising manufacturers of high-polluting vehicles if they exceed an
  emissions cap. The AAA’s testing scheme was put into place after a 2015
  scandal involving Volkswagen, when it was found the manufacturer had misled
  consumers who may have deliberately bought vehicles based on incorrect claims
  of lower emissions. The AAA says it tests cars on roads in and around Geelong,
  using strict protocols to ensure fuel consumption and emissions results are
  repeatable and to minimise the influence of human factors such as driving
  style and variable traffic flows.
