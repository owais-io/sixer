  ‘I would not feel safe’: Americans on the sorrow – and relief – of leaving
  Trump’s US for Europe

  The scramble began in November as news broke that Donald Trump had been
  re-elected. Benjamin and Chrys Gorman had long said they would leave the US
  before seeing Trump inaugurated again, giving them exactly 76 days to sell
  their home, cars and most of their belongings and move four people, three dogs
  and two cats to Barcelona. “I was saying: we’ve got more time than that, it
  won’t go that fast,” said Gorman. “My wife said no, we need to be out of here
  – not just on inauguration day, but a few days before. And she was so right.”
  Within hours of taking office, Trump signed an executive order defining sex as
  only male or female. The change was to be reflected on official documents,
  sowing confusion over what it meant for Americans with the non-binary
  identification of “X” in their passports. Relief gripped the Gormans as they
  watched it play out from afar. “Our kid’s passport has an X gender marker,”
  said Gorman. “So we managed to escape just in time.” Since Trump’s return to
  power, relocation firms from London to Lisbon and Madrid to Milan say they’ve
  seen a surge in inquiries from Americans. Undaunted by the gains made by the
  far right across the continent, many Americans cite a desire to escape the
  US’s increasingly polarised climate and an administration whose wide range of
  targets has included immigrants, diversity measures and political opponents.
  Statistics suggest that the barrage of interest is translating into action; in
  the first two months of the year, US applications for Irish passports were at
  their highest level in a decade – up 60% from the same period last year. In
  the first three months of the year, France reported a rise in the number of
  long-stay visa requests from Americans, while in March, the number of
  Americans who had solicited British citizenship in the 12 months before surged
  to its highest since record-keeping began in 2004. While the figures remain
  relatively small given the size of the US population, the movement has been
  galvanised by a steady drip of celebrity announcements. Rosie O’Donnell said
  in March that she had moved to Ireland, describing it as “heartbreaking to see
  what’s happening politically” in the US, while Ellen DeGeneres recently cited
  Trump’s re-election to explain why she and her wife, Portia de Rossi, had
  moved to the Cotswolds in 2024. Earlier this month, Jimmy Kimmel revealed that
  he had acquired Italian citizenship, saying that the US under Trump was “just
  unbelievable”. Across Europe, governments and institutions have sought to
  capitalise on the exodus, launching programmes aimed at attracting stateside
  talent or, in the case of one enterprising Italian village, seeking to bolster
  its population with disgruntled Americans. Among the first was France’s
  Aix-Marseille University, which in March put out an offer of “scientific
  asylum” for researchers reeling from Trump’s crackdown on academia. Three
  months later, the university said it had received more than 500 inquiries for
  the 20 spots. Those selected included Lisa, a biological anthropologist who
  was preparing to move her husband, a school teacher, and two children across
  the Atlantic. “When Trump was re-elected, the feeling was: ‘We gotta go,’” she
  told the Guardian earlier this summer. She asked that her last name not be
  used to protect her university in the US from reprisals. The sentiment had
  strengthened as she watched the Trump administration take aim at universities,
  dismantle research funding and undermine science. “We’re months into this
  presidency, and a lot has already happened. I can’t imagine what’s going to
  happen in another three and a half years.” The opportunity to swap the
  northern US for southern France was welcome, but not without its drawbacks.
  “It is a big pay cut,” she said. “My kids are super gung-ho. My husband is
  just worried that he won’t find a job. Which is my worry too, because I don’t
  think I’ll be able to afford four of us on my salary.” In January, as
  thousands of Trump faithful turned up in Washington DC for a televised viewing
  of his inauguration, Deborah Harkness knew the time had come to act on her
  longstanding dream of moving to southern Spain. “As soon as he was
  inaugurated, I started making plans,” she said. Months later she was in
  Málaga, watching as Trump’s administration sought to drastically reshape the
  judiciary, public broadcasting, higher education and immigration. “What
  frightens me most is how normalised it’s all become,” she said. “The chaos,
  the cruelty, the disinformation – that’s how authoritarianism takes hold.” The
  view was echoed by Monica Byrne, who in 2023 left North Carolina for Cork,
  Ireland. Trump was a factor in her decision, but only in that she saw his rise
  to power as a symptom of the bigger issues facing the US. “I didn’t know
  whether Trump specifically was going to come back, but I knew fascism was,”
  she said. “So it was more about the abject failure of the Democrats and
  knowing they weren’t going to protect us from fascism generally.” Trump’s
  re-election cemented her decision to remain abroad and enrol in a master’s
  programme in Ireland. “I get frustrated when people say: ‘You’re very lucky or
  you must be happy you’re not there,’” she said. “There is some degree of that,
  but 90% of the people I care about and love are in the States and are
  affected.” In Barcelona, Gorman and his family have been slowly settling into
  the rhythms of the city. “So many things have just been shockingly better,” he
  said. “For example, my wife was saying that the other day she was walking
  along La Rambla and a car backfired. And she was the only person who ducked.”
  While they were thrilled to have left behind the gun violence and shooter
  drills of the US, the challenge was now in explaining to their loved ones that
  they were unlikely to return home once Trump’s term ends. “I don’t foresee
  this movement ending with the end of the Trump administration … I think that
  the rot is much deeper,” said Gorman. “If he wouldn’t have a huge base of
  support, Trump is just, you know, your crazy uncle yelling things on a porch.
  That base of support needs to be addressed. Why was there support for this
  kind of fascism?” he added. “And that’s a much deeper question. I would not
  personally feel safe going back to a country that doesn’t fully reckon with
  its fascist impulses.”
