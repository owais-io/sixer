  The Home Office is threatening to ban a Canadian academic from the UK after
  she was unable to renew her visa in time during a mental health crisis. Dr
  Heather Scott has lived in Britain since she came in 2011 on a study visa. The
  renowned academic, whose area of research relates to Victorian cemeteries
  including Highgate, Brompton and Abney Park, is required to be based in
  London. She has successfully renewed her visa seven times in the past. But in
  2022, she became seriously mentally ill. She was hospitalised for 13 weeks and
  was unable to engage with the visa renewal system as a result of being so
  unwell. She overstayed for 46 days before her family in Canada could make an
  application for further leave to remain on her behalf. Since then she has been
  trying to resolve her visa situation for three years with no success, despite
  submitting extensive documentary evidence to the Home Office about the medical
  emergency she experienced. “I am deeply concerned about the effects this will
  have on my research and employment and on my quality of life and continued
  recovery,” Scott said. “This feels like a penalty for an infraction that was
  outside of my control. It does not seem right that I should be punished for
  having an illness.” Her mental health has improved and she has resumed her
  academic research. She has lodged an appeal on human rights grounds, but if it
  is unsuccessful she is facing a ban from the UK. An application she made in
  2024 for leave to remain was refused on the grounds that she was medically
  stable and could return to Canada. Scott said: “My case highlights the issue
  of the Home Office applying policy in a way that is actually at odds with
  their own and Prime Minister Starmer’s priority of attracting and retaining
  highly qualified professionals within the UK’s research and employment
  sectors. It also highlights the hostility of the current climate regarding
  mental illness.” In its refusal letter, the Home Office said that indefinite
  leave to remain was “a privilege, not an automatic entitlement”. Officials
  added: “A mere wish, desire or preference to live in the UK does not amount to
  an exceptional circumstance.” They said the fact she was prevented from
  applying in time to renew her visa due to being “acutely ill” also did not
  amount to an exceptional circumstance. Scott’s solicitor, Muhunthan
  Paramesvaran of Wilson Solicitors, said: “This is an exceptional case and the
  Home Office’s decision is wrong in my view. She has spent 10 years here
  lawfully and had it not been for her mental health issues she would have been
  able to sit the Life in the UK test and would have been granted indefinite
  leave to remain. “The Home Office has discretion to grant indefinite leave to
  remain outside the rules. Their refusal to do so has had a devastating impact
  on her. She has had to put her life on hold.” A Home Office spokesperson said:
  “All visa applications are carefully considered on their individual merits in
  accordance with the immigration rules.”
