  The Australian government was hit with sharp criticism in May when – despite
  its promise that it would take serious action – the country’s greenhouse gas
  emissions were revealed to have slightly increased last year. New data for the
  year to March suggest this has now changed. According to a climate department
  quarterly inventory, heat-trapping pollution dropped by 1.4%. It was down 6.5m
  tonnes to 440.2m tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is 28% less than in 2005.
  Unless it picks up, that rate of decline is not fast enough to meet the
  Albanese government’s legislated emissions reduction target for 2030 (a 43%
  cut compared with 2005). To get there, emissions needs to drop by about 15m
  tonnes a year on average. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Much deeper cuts
  again will be needed by 2035. The government is expected to announce its
  delayed 2035 target next month after receiving advice from the Climate Change
  Authority, led by Matt Kean. Pollution from electricity is down The good news
  in the latest data is the reduction in pollution coming from fossil fuel
  plants. Last year, emissions from power generation increased for the first
  time in a decade. Australians used more electricity and there was less hydro
  and wind energy available. Solar was up, but the gap was otherwise met by
  burning more coal and gas. In the year to March, emissions from electricity
  fell 0.8m tonnes – just a 0.5% drop, but a reversal on where things had been.
  It was driven by increases in wind and rooftop solar generation in the
  national grid. There was also a bit more hydro power. Coal and gas generation
  were down. Electricity generation is Australia’s biggest source of emissions,
  responsible for about a third of the national total. Until last year,
  pollution from power plants had been coming down – 23.8% since 2005 – due to
  an influx of solar and wind. The government is relying on that decline
  accelerating fast to hit its emissions target. It has promised 82% of all
  electricity will come from renewable sources by 2030. That is more than double
  the proportion now. In the year to March, 54.9% of electricity still came from
  coal, 39.9% from renewables and 5.2% from gas-fired power. The industry and
  experts have warned that investment in new large-scale renewable energy is not
  happening at the pace needed to make up that gap. It has slowed this year.
  There is a ray of light in a preliminary snapshot of emissions data for the
  year to June, also included in the latest inventory. It suggests emissions
  from electricity fell 3.2% over that period, indicating April-June this year
  was great for clean energy. Emissions also down from industry, farms In the
  year to March, there was a 2.7% drop in pollution from stationary energy,
  which includes fossil fuel burning in manufacturing, mining, and commercial
  and residential buildings. This was due to less coal being burned in metal
  manufacturing and households using less gas for heating and cooking. Fugitive
  emissions – mostly leaks – from fossil fuel mining and transportation were
  down 2.2%. Pollution from industrial processes – mostly production of
  chemicals, metals and minerals – dropped 4.7%, in part due to steel production
  being lower. In agriculture, pollution fell 1.3%, mainly due to fewer grazing
  cattle and sheep. But transport pollution keeps rising Pollution from
  transport – road, rail and domestic aviation and shipping – continues to head
  in the wrong direction. It was up 0.5m tonnes, or 0.5%. This was a smaller
  rise than in recent years, but continues a long-term trend that was briefly
  interrupted by Covid-19 shutdowns. Transport is Australia’s second-biggest
  sectoral source of emissions after electricity generation, and has increased
  22.4% higher over the past 20 years. The most recent increase was due to a
  jump in use of jet fuel and diesel. The increase was partly offset by a small
  drop in petrol use. Australia’s diesel vehicle fleet – including SUVs, freight
  vehicles and buses – has increased 93% since 2014. What is driving change?
  According to the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, the data shows the
  government’s policies are having an impact. They include a large-scale
  electricity underwriting scheme and a revamped safeguard mechanism, which
  requires the country’s biggest polluting sites to cut emissions intensity
  year-on-year or buy contentious carbon offsets. The redesigned safeguard
  mechanism has been criticised for not requiring enough of polluters, including
  financially rewarding some companies that increase emissions. Data for the
  first year suggested the total cut in direct emissions across the 219 big
  emitting facilities covered by the scheme was 2.7m tonnes, or nearly 2%. Bowen
  said a new vehicle efficiency standard was projected to eventually cut
  emissions from cars and, despite the criticisms, maintained the government was
  “on track” to meet its emissions reduction targets “if we stay the course and
  continue to lift our efforts”. What about forests and the land? But the bulk
  of Australia’s emissions reductions are not due to changes in fossil fuel use,
  or climate change policy. The overwhelming majority of the claimed 28% cut
  since 2005 is based on estimates of the change how much CO2 has been sucked
  from the atmosphere and stored in forests and the land. Critics say
  nature-based carbon absorption is important, but its measurement is far from
  perfect and it cannot be assumed to be permanent, given the rising risk of
  drought, fire and flood. There is a case that land and forest emissions should
  be counted separately to the rest of the economy to give a truer picture of
  what is happening with fossil fuel use. If the land is excluded from the
  latest data, national emissions were only 3.7% lower in the year to March than
  in 2005. That’s an improvement from a year ago, when they were down only 2.5%.
  But it shows how far there is to go.
