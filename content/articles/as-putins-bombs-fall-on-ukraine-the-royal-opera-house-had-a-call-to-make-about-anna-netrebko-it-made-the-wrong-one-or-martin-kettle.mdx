  Puccini’s Tosca is high on the list of operas I don’t much care if I never see
  again. So the fact that the Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, unquestionably one
  of our era’s exceptional opera singers, is due to sing Tosca in a new
  production at Covent Garden next month does not present me with a dilemma. I
  won’t be there anyway. It might be more difficult, I admit, if Netrebko was
  singing Verdi, where she is so outstanding. But this column is not about my
  taste in opera. It is about something of wider moral importance. Netrebko’s
  London performances pose complex questions but require straightforward
  answers. First, is it right for a prestigious British institution, the Royal
  Opera House, to be hiring Netrebko while the Ukraine war continues? The answer
  could in theory be yes, were she to repeat her opposition to the war, but on
  the current evidence it is no. Second, whether the hiring is right or wrong,
  what should now happen in the run-up to her premiere here on 11 September?
  Here, compromise is the least bad outcome for all involved. And, third, how
  far, if at all, should the arts become a proxy for politics, particularly at
  critical and brutal moments like the current Russian offensive in the Donbas
  region? In theory, they should not. In practice, quite simply, they are. As
  ever, there are many sides to each problem. The case against Netrebko is that
  she is a highly prominent Russian who has praised Vladimir Putin in the past,
  accepted honours from the Russian state, and who, after Russia’s first war
  with Ukraine in 2014, was photographed with a pro-Kremlin separatist flag. In
  2022, opera houses around the world quickly dispensed with Netrebko’s services
  when Putin’s armies invaded Ukraine. The war was an existential threat not
  just to Ukraine, but to Europe and its values – and it still is. Some of these
  points were set out in a trenchant letter to the Guardian on 14 August, signed
  by more than 50 Ukrainian writers and artists, a cross-party group of UK MPs,
  and the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark. The letter did not
  mince words. It accused Netrebko of being a “longtime symbol of cultural
  propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes”. It said
  that nothing significant has changed to justify her hiring, and that the Royal
  Opera House must choose between its profits and its values. Netrebko’s defence
  disputes all these points, but adds several others. As a prominent Russian,
  she argues, she has indeed met Putin, but she is not an ally. As a Russian,
  she is entitled to accept Russian honours. She did not know the significance
  of the flag in the 2014 photograph. However, Netrebko also now lives and pays
  her taxes in Austria. Just after the 2022 invasion she said on social media:
  “I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression and I am calling on Russia
  to end this war right now, to save all of us!” She has not been to Russia
  since 2022, and was attacked for her stance by the head of the Russian Duma.
  She also argues that, as an artist, she should not be required to take a
  public stand against her homeland in order to pursue her career. Netrebko’s
  case is clearly different in several important ways – though the extent
  remains a source of dispute – from that of the Russian conductor Valery
  Gergiev, a regime lickspittle. Gergiev, long a familiar figure in the London
  musical scene, has repeatedly taken an outright pro-Putin stance, not just on
  Ukraine. He also led so-called victory concerts for Putin in Syria and in the
  disputed Russian territory of South Ossetia. Gergiev would probably jump at
  the chance of leading a similar gig in Ukraine. Netrebko, you suspect, would
  keep well away. Nevertheless, Covent Garden’s own case is a muddle. The opera
  house says it has “always been clear” that Russian nationality does not equate
  with support for Putin, and that Netrebko has “made clear statements”
  attacking his war. But it also says that things have now changed to allow
  Netrebko’s return. “Our support for Ukraine was aligned with the global
  consensus at the time,” the chief executive, Alex Beard, announced. “As the
  world’s geopolitics have become more complex, our stance has changed to ensure
  that our actions reflect our purpose and values.” These are weasel words. The
  suspicion has to be that Covent Garden was always keen to get Netrebko back as
  soon as it could. She was rumoured to be returning to the Royal Opera in June
  2023 but never did. Yet while London hesitated, other big opera houses in
  Vienna, Munich and Milan have brought her in while the war still raged, as
  early as September 2022 in Vienna’s case. Covent Garden’s reopened door comes
  only a few months before Netrebko also returns to the Paris Opera. Soon, the
  only standout among the world’s glamour opera houses may be the New York Met.
  The Met boss, Peter Gelb, said this month: “I believe that cultural leaders
  must stand by their decisions in support of a free and democratic world.”
  Netrebko is suing the Met. But Covent Garden, like others in Europe, has bent
  with the wind. Surely, if a Russian star was unacceptable in 2022, they should
  still be unacceptable in 2025. Is there a way through this jungle of
  conflicting passions and principles? One solution would be for Covent Garden
  to bow to the critics and pull the Tosca run, or at least Netrebko’s part in
  it. The chances of that seem nil. Apart from anything else, Covent Garden
  would face a huge legal bill. Another is that Netrebko could herself pull out
  and be replaced by Aleksandra Kurzak, who is scheduled to take over the role
  of Tosca on 24 September. This outcome seems unlikely too. It does not seem in
  Netrebko’s proud character. It would certainly help if, before 11 September,
  Netrebko was to say something unambiguous for the British audience in
  opposition to Putin’s continuing war, and acknowledging the justice of the
  feelings of the objectors. Covent Garden’s management would be crazy not to
  press for this to happen in some way. This has been a slow car crash event. It
  would not have happened if Covent Garden had been smarter about the
  reputational dangers, and how they are multiplied in the social media age.
  But, like Donald Trump with Putin in Alaska, Covent Garden imagined it could
  have the best of both worlds, by flying the Ukrainian flag and hiring
  Netrebko. It has been proved wrong. Unless something changes, the story in two
  weeks’ time will not be Netrebko’s singing but the pro-Ukraine protests –
  outside and perhaps even inside the opera house. It would be an outcome that
  Britain’s figurehead arts institution has brought entirely upon itself. Martin
