  Near the end of an antisemitism training video that Northwestern University
  students are required to watch, the narrator urges viewers to play a guessing
  game. Six statements pop on to the screen – the viewer must choose whether
  they were made by “anti-Israel activists” or the former Ku Klux Klan grand
  wizard David Duke. Among the statements: “Every time I read Hitler, I fall in
  love again.” The video reveals that the statement was made by an “anti-Israel
  activist”. The narrator then states: “The fact that you can’t tell the
  difference is terrifying.” He adds that for most Jews, being anti-Israel and
  antisemitic “are the same”. The video is part of a wave of controversial
  antisemitism trainings being implemented by universities across the US
  starting this school year, in response to Trump administration threats to pull
  funding for institutions that, in its view, fail to adequately address campus
  antisemitism. It is not clear how universities will enforce student
  participation. The Northwestern training was produced by the Jewish United
  Federation (JUF) , a pro-Israel advocacy group, and it drew pushback from some
  students. The Hitler statement was probably tweeted in 2013 by a high school
  student, members of pro-Palestinian Northwestern groups found. They accused
  JUF of cherrypicking a child’s comment made 12 years ago to portray all
  criticism of Israel and Zionism as antisemitic. Moreover, the Hitler comment
  was placed among statements that legitimately criticize the Israeli government
  and are not antisemitic. The broader goal is to silence opposition to Israel’s
  genocide in Gaza, said Micol Bez, a graduate student at Northwestern who is
  supportive of Palestinian rights. “We were shocked by the video … which
  directly vilifies the movement for rights for Palestinian people and
  non-Zionist Jews who stand against genocide,” Bez said. “It explicitly
  requires students to adopt the position that there’s no room for anti-Zionism,
  and that all anti-Zionism is antisemitic.” The trainings’ opponents, many of
  them Jewish, say the material does little to protect Jews. They accuse the
  Trump administration of wielding often false claims of antisemitism for two
  ends – to cut funding for universities as the president wages a culture war on
  higher education, and to help rightwing pro-Israel groups silence legitimate
  criticism of Israel. At least 60 universities so far have been investigated by
  the US Department of Education for potential violations of Title VI, a law
  that prohibits schools from discrimination based on race, ethnicity and
  religion. Columbia University, City University of New York, Harvard University
  and Barnard University are among those implementing antisemitism trainings,
  which were generally developed after the Trump crackdown, and may aim to
  appease the Trump administration. At Northwestern, which is under multiple
  federal investigations for alleged antisemitism, the university emailed
  students in March to say that the implementation of the training “will adhere
  to federal policy including President Donald Trump’s Jan. 29 executive order,
  ‘Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism’”. Students who do not complete
  the training cannot register for classes, while graduate students can lose
  stipends. Bez said she had viewed the training, but had so far refused to
  officially complete it and the university had put a hold on her registration.
  Introducing the training has not helped Northwestern’s relationship with the
  Trump administration. Even after implementing it, the administration cut $790m
  in research funding. Trump is now trying to extract further concessions. “They
  thought this would save them – it did not,” said Noah Cooper, a Northwestern
  sophomore and an anti-Zionist with Jewish Voice for Peace who completed the
  training. The Guardian reviewed training materials developed by the JUF and
  the Anti-Defamation League, which both push pro-Israel agendas in the US, and
  found the overarching message is that criticism of Israel or Zionism is
  antisemitic. The materials advise students on how to respond to antisemitic or
  anti-Israel speech, and spread a pro-Israel message. That includes tips on
  effective online debating, media strategies and how to pressure administrators
  into cracking down on anti-Israel campus speech. Some Jewish and free speech
  groups have raised a litany of concerns about the materials, including that
  they are often one-sided, misleading, vague and sometimes historically
  inaccurate. Not only did the trainings do little to protect Jews from
  antisemitism, the universities and Trump may even be endangering Jews because
  they are “allowing antisemitism to be used for other political purposes”, like
  attacking higher education, said Jeremy Ben-Ami, executive director of J
  Street, a center-left, pro-Zionist lobbying and cultural organization. “If
  people start to see that their universities, their medical research and their
  neighbors’ immigration status and right to due process are being endangered
  because the Jewish community is pressuring for enforcement in ways that go way
  too far – that will generate actual antisemitism,” Ben-Ami added. In an email,
  a Northwestern spokesperson said students “are not required to agree” with the
  antisemitism trainings and stressed that the speaker in the video said he did
  not speak for all Jewish people. “However, he does represent how many in the
  Jewish community feel when targeted with certain actions and words, and we
  believe it is important for our students to have an understanding of that,”
  the spokesperson wrote. ‘Anti-Israel situation’ The ADL also has created their
  own antisemitism training and is partnering with Columbia among other
  universities to implement it. A centerpiece of their “Think. Plan. Act.”
  toolkit for higher education is a section titled “How can I be prepared for
  antisemitic and anti-Israel bias on campus? Scenarios and best practices.” It
  lays out 10 hypothetical antisemitic and “anti-Israel situations”, why the ADL
  views them as a problem and advises students on how to respond. One scenario
  explains why someone spray-painting swastikas on a Jewish fraternity home is a
  problem, while another example examines why fliers criticizing the Israeli
  government for demolishing Palestinian homes is similarly an issue. A third
  raises concerns over a hypothetical “charge that a sponsored Israel trip Is
  ‘pro-apartheid propaganda’”. Lumping together examples of legitimate criticism
  of Israel’s government and obvious antisemitic acts is designed to convince
  students and administrators that the actions are similarly problematic,
  critics say. It also appears to raise the specter of Title VI discrimination
  violations, said Veronica Salama, an attorney with the New York Civil
  Liberties Union. However, Title VI doesn’t protect against criticism of
  countries, and a term like “anti-Israel situation” has no legal meaning, but
  critics say the intent is evident. “Scaring schools into adopting these rigid
  speech limitations to avoid a federal investigation or a possible Title VI
  suit turns academic freedom and free speech principles on its head,” Salama
  said. The ADL’s hypothetical scenario involving flyers critical of Israel’s
  demolition program encapsulates many other issues that those who reviewed the
  material or completed a training raised. The scenario begins with a student
  leaving their dorm room to find a flyer taped to the door “warning that your
  residence hall will soon be demolished”. “The rest of the flyer contains
  ‘facts’ about how many Palestinian homes have been demolished by the Israeli
  military to collectively punish and ‘ethnically cleanse’ Palestinians,” the
  toolkit continues. The ADL is referring to the highly charged debate over
  Israel’s mass expulsion of Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank. The
  training material then offers the Israeli narrative around the demolitions,
  claiming they target “terrorists” and “deter others from terrorist action”.
  Other homes were demolished because they were “built without proper permits”,
  the ADL states. “While you may agree or disagree with these Israeli government
  actions, the charge that Israel has demolished these homes to ‘ethnically
  cleanse’ Palestinians is inaccurate and inflammatory,” the ADL material
  states. The Palestinian perspective on the demolitions is not found in the
  training material, and excluding their side story is a problem, those who
  reviewed the material said. As many as 40,000 Palestinians in the West Bank
  alone, including refugee camps, are estimated to have been forced from their
  homes since the beginning of 2024, in addition to millions more in Israel and
  the Palestinian territories in previous decades. A UN special rapporteur in
  March warned of an “ethnic cleansing” in the West Bank as Israel has
  accelerated demolitions. Meanwhile, the Israeli military often won’t issue
  building permits to Palestinians. The antisemitism training video was shown as
  part of a new mandatory bias training called Building a Community of Respect
  and Breaking Down Bias. The antisemitism video is shown alongside a separate
  video made in partnership with The Inclusion Expert, a bias training company,
  on anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias, and a third video about campus protest. The
  Islamophobia training covers forms of bias and racism toward Arab, Muslim and
  Palestinian people. But, unlike the JUF antisemitism video that presented a
  pro-Israel viewpoint on the conflict, there was no historical context or basic
  arguments for the Palestinian cause. Nor did it mention what has happened in
  Gaza after the 7 October Hamas attack. “The point was not to foster
  conversation or give people a nuanced view of this conflict,” Northwestern’s
  Cooper said. “The point was to get people to agree on one particular
  worldview.” The trainings also drew criticism because they are often vague,
  and demand different standards for the Israeli and Palestinian causes. The ADL
  concedes that the hypothetical flyers criticizing Israel over its demolition
  of Palestinian homes “could represent legitimate political discourse”. But it
  states that the flyers would be “less acceptable” if the university
  administration had approved of them. “What this training is saying is, ‘If
  your school allows let’s say Students for Justice in Palestine to put up a
  flyer like this, then they are necessarily violating Title VI’, and that is
  just not true,” Salama said. The ADL’s material repeatedly advises students on
  how to respond to criticism of Israel and antisemitism. It suggests pressuring
  administration to respond, contacting Hillel, reporting issues to the ADL or
  writing op-eds, among other actions. “Strategize with your friends, campus
  Hillel and/or representatives of the pro-Israel community about countering the
  false allegations made in the flier and further educating about Israel’s
  security challenges,” the ADL states. ‘On British land’ Northwestern students
  pointed to a list of controversial statements and claims made throughout the
  antisemitism training video, called “Antisemitism Here/Now”. It employs a
  controversial and legally dubious definition of antisemitism written by the
  International Holocaust Remembrance Association, that critics say equates
  criticism of Israel with antisemitism. The video states that Israel was
  founded in 1948 “on British land”, and refers to the West Bank as “Judea and
  Samaria”, the biblical name controversially used for the region by the Israeli
  government. The original Jewish homeland comprises parts of modern-day Egypt,
  Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, the video states. Bez questioned why the university
  did not utilize Northwestern scholars on the region and its history, and
  instead hired an outside pro-Israel group to develop the training. “The
  content is incredibly unscholarly and has really, really egregious claims,”
  Bez said. “It erases the pain and suffering of Palestinian people, and
  normalizes language that is being used to push the occupation.” In a
  statement, a Northwestern spokesperson said, “part the University’s mission is
  exposing our students to viewpoints that are different, and in some cases
  challenging, from their own – a key part of Northwestern’s mission.”
  Meanwhile, as the narrator attempts to conflate Judaism and Zionism, it states
  that the “vast majority” of Jewish people are Zionist. “I am an anti-Zionist
  Jew and it doesn’t make me feel good, safe or protected in the way the video
  claimed to,” Cooper said.
