  In December 2024 I arrived in Sydney ready for an adventure. A friend was
  getting married in Australia and I had originally booked the trip with my ex,
  but when he dropped out after our breakup I decided to go ahead. I was
  considering quitting my job and moving back to the Netherlands so, even though
  I didn’t know what my future would look like, I was ready for a holiday. I
  planned a week with friends in Sydney and Newcastle, a week with a friend
  travelling up the east coast and a final week on my own. On New Year’s Eve I’d
  been at an all-day boat party on Sydney Harbour when a friend said she was off
  to meet an old flame of hers at a fireworks event in Bondi. I remember her
  telling me he had a nice single brother called Ben and showing me a photo: he
  had a moustache, was wearing a tank top and didn’t look like my type at all. I
  told her I wasn’t interested. I just wanted to stay with friends. When my
  friend’s taxi arrived she pulled me in with her – and thank goodness she did
  because, when I met Ben in person, he looked completely different to the guy
  in the photos – tall and handsome with a big smile. He immediately made me
  laugh. We kissed within 10 minutes of saying hello, which was about half an
  hour before midnight. Ben had been ill with food poisoning and hadn’t been in
  particularly high spirits until we arrived but said he immediately forgot
  about all of that. There was just this instant connection and we both felt as
  though we had nothing to lose. We lived too far apart to ever see each other
  again. The following day Ben and his brother invited my friend and me to a
  music festival. We worried it would be awkward at first but Ben and I picked
  up where we’d left off. We were like little kids running between stages. The
  next morning I had to leave for the wedding in Newcastle. I remember kissing
  Ben goodbye at the ferry terminal in Manly, wondering if I’d ever see this man
  again but knowing I definitely wanted to. We started texting straight away and
  I was so distracted I ended up missing my connecting train. Later in the trip
  I got an ear infection just before a five-day scuba diving expedition on the
  Great Barrier Reef. I cancelled – and something inside me was happy to,
  knowing that it would give me five days without a plan. Ben was competing in a
  triathlon in Nelson Bay and he asked if I wanted to come watch him drown,
  which felt like a fun way to hang out. It turned out to be an indirect
  invitation to stay with his aunt and uncle for the weekend. I booked a flight
  immediately. At this point I saw the whole thing as a bit of fun – a holiday
  romance, nothing serious. Being so far from home gave me a kind of “why not”
  mentality. We both knew long-distance between London and Sydney would never
  work so we just decided to enjoy each other’s company for as long as we had
  it. Over the next couple of days we spent time with his aunt and uncle, slept
  in a tent on the beach and competed in a mini-triathlon together. I remember
  travelling back to Sydney with Ben holding my hand the whole way back. He
  didn’t want to let me go and I felt the same way. He booked flights to
  Melbourne with me for the Australian Open that week, and I ended up delaying
  my return flight so we could have an extra day together. Leaving each other at
  Melbourne airport was when we decided to see if maybe we could make
  long-distance work after all. We agreed to meet in Scotland six weeks later,
  calling each other every day in the meantime. I met all of Ben’s family and
  friends on that trip to Scotland and, after four days, he asked me to be his
  girlfriend. This time when we went our separate ways it wasn’t just goodbye
  until the next trip; it was goodbye until we moved in together. It wasn’t in
  my character to do things like this but it just felt right and my friends and
  family could see that. They told me to take a leap of faith and see what
  happened. Ben and I reunited eight weeks later at Sydney airport and this time
  I was holding more than just a holiday bag. It turns out that my first
  impressions of Ben were right; we talked non-stop that New Year’s Eve and, to
  be honest, we’ve never really stopped. He is still that fun and charismatic
  guy who makes me feel comfortable. For now Australia is our home but we plan
  to move back to Europe together in the longer term. Whether that’s England,
  Scotland or the Netherlands remains to be seen – that’s for figuring out later
  down the line. All I know is that we will find our home together. Tell us the
  moment you knew
