  Blair Kinghorn and James Ryan have been named to start for the British &amp;
  Irish Lions in their third Test against the Wallabies in Sydney on Saturday as
  Andy Farrell’s side seek to wrap up a series whitewash. Kinghorn is selected
  on the left wing with James Lowe dropping out of the 23 while Ryan replaces
  Ollie Chessum, who has been named on the bench. Kinghorn impressed as a
  replacement in the last-gasp victory in Melbourne last week and though he is a
  fullback by trade, he often appears on the wing for Toulouse. Ryan also caught
  the eye off the bench at the MCG and comes into the starting XV alongside Maro
  Itoje, who continues as captain. Ryan is one of nine Ireland players selected
  along with Tadhg Furlong who will equal Alun Wyn Jones in starting nine
  consecutive Tests for the Lions. Itoje will also appear in his ninth straight
  Lions Test, having made his debut off the bench in New Zealand in 2017. Lowe
  pays the price for indifferent form in the first two Tests but Farrell has
  resisted making wholesale changes to his side which will bid to become the
  first to complete a series whitewash since 1927 and the first to go unbeaten
  since 1974. It means that Sione Tuipulotu again misses out with Bundee Aki and
  Huw Jones keeping their places in midfield. It is unclear whether Joe McCarthy
  was deemed fit to play, having missed the second Test with a foot injury, but
  Ryan is rewarded for his form of late after a slow start to the tour. On the
  bench, Owen Farrell is again selected as part of a 6-2 split with Ben Earl
  also recalled, having missed out in Melbourne. Up front Furlong is joined by
  Leinster teammates Dan Sheehan and Andrew Porter again while Tadhg Beirne, Tom
  Curry and Jack Conan keep their places in the back-row. Jamison Gibson-Park
  and Finn Russell are again the halfbacks while Tommy Freeman stays on the
  right wing and Hugo Keenan is once more named at fullback after his
  last-minute try sealed the series win last week. On the bench, Ellis Genge,
  Ronan Kelleher and Will Stuart again provide front-row cover while Chessum,
  Jac Morgan and Earl complete the forwards contingent. Joining Farrell among
  the backs is Alex Mitchell, who has now been named in every squad on the tour.
  “We have put ourselves in a great position to finish this Tour with our best
  performance to date and create our own piece of history,” Andy Farrell said.
  “Last weekend’s Test match in Melbourne was an incredible spectacle and
  illustrated how special Lions Tours are and what they mean to both the players
  and the supporters. We are expecting another epic battle this weekend against
  a Wallaby side that showed their quality last week.”
