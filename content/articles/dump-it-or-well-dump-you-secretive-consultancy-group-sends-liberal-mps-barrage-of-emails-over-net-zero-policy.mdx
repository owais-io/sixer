  Liberal MPs have been sent a barrage of emails demanding they drop net zero
  targets or “risk losing our support” by a group connected to conservative
  right-wing lobby group Advance. The mass emails, seen by Guardian Australia,
  have been sent to multiple Liberals by Whitestone Strategic, a secretive
  political consultancy group, and come as the Coalition reviews its energy
  policy. Coalition MPs began receiving the emails – which one described as
  looking as if they were sent by AI bots – on Monday night. Some MPs received
  more than 100 within 48 hours from the same address. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email One of the emails reads: “A message to the Liberal Party and Nationals:
  Net Zero is causing irreversible damage to our nation. Our economic health is
  declining … immediate action is required. Dump Net Zero policies now, or we
  will stop supporting your agenda.” Another reads: “Net Zero is a dangerous
  joke. It’s time to dump it, or we’ll dump you.” The email sender appears to be
  Whitestone Strategic but the email address is listed as CiviClick – a US-based
  platform that describes itself as AI-powered grassroots advocacy software that
  allows users to “reach elected officials with powerful policy messages”. A
  Guardian Australia investigation in October revealed Whitestone Strategic’s
  close ties to Advance, the rightwing advocacy group behind the main
  organisation promoting a no vote in the Indigenous voice referendum, Fair
  Australia. A separate investigation also found Whitestone Strategic billed
  taxpayers almost $135,000 over two years for work providing media messaging
  for conservative politicians during the voice to parliament campaign.
  Whitestone Strategic’s work for Coalition members has extended beyond the
  voice campaign. None of the emails, sent since Monday, are addressed directly
  to the politician, or signed off by a member of the public. Many of the dozens
  of emails received by MPs contain the same message and some contain what
  appears to be coding left in unintentionally. Advance announced on 8 August it
  would launch a campaign targeting “weakling” Liberals, by pressuring them to
  drop their support for net zero by 2050. On 15 August, it said its supporters
  had sent 19,897 emails to Coalition MPs and senators. Several members who
  received the emails expressed frustration over the tactic. One Liberal, who
  spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they received at least 50 emails in
  24 hours, none directly addressed to them. “The policy review process is
  important, we must take the time to do it right,” they said. “We cannot be
  distracted by external groups with their own agendas.” Another Liberal, who
  asked not to be named, derided the emails and said they looked as if they had
  been sent by “AI bots”, due to multiples of the same message being sent. This
  MP, who said they were previously supportive of Whitestone’s work, said “Why
  can’t Whitestone get this stuff right?”. Liberal senator for South Australia
  Andrew McLachlan, a vocal supporter of net zero and climate action, confirmed
  he’d received dozens of emails from Whitestone Strategic over the last 48
  hours. He said maintaining emissions reduction targets is critical and said he
  would continue to advocate for the target. “It is not ‘weakness’ to support
  targets to reduce pollution. You are not a ‘weakling’ to be committed to
  exploring every possible solution to respond to our changing climate,” he
  said. The Liberal party is reviewing its energy policies, led by the shadow
  energy minister, Dan Tehan. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, hasn’t
  committed to keeping net zero, but some vocal members of the Coalition –
  including Barnaby Joyce, Michael McCormack, Matt Canavan and Tony Pasin – have
  been publicly and privately lobbying against the target. In response to
  questions from Guardian Australia, Advance said they wouldn’t comment on
  individual emails from supporters, but that “it is no secret that we are
  campaigning against net zero and have asked our supporters to contact MPs to
  voice their opposition”.
