  My petty gripe: bands naming themselves as puns on other bands – will it never
  end?

  It’s a tradition almost as old as popular music itself: a band name that puns,
  plays on, or pays tribute to the name of another artist. In the rock’n’roll
  era, you can trace it back at least to Chubby Checker. Known to his mum as
  Ernest Evans, the Chubber named himself in homage to Fats Domino and, in 1960,
  helped popularise a dance craze called “the twist”. Then came the Beatles,
  whose name was inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets. The Beatles begat the
  Byrds, and the Monkees, not to mention the Rutles – and on and on it goes. And
  on and on and on. In the past week, I have received notices for two Australian
  hopefuls, the Southern River Band and Shepparton Airplane. There is also
  Toowoomba’s Kathleen Turner Overdrive, whose name is cribbed from High
  Fidelity (it’s less likely they filched it from the obscure pop-punk band
  founded in Atlanta, Georgia in 1993). I have nothing whatsoever against the
  music of any of these groups. If my displeasure at their chosen nomenclature
  inspires you to seek them out, then good for you, and them. One of my own
  personal favourites, the Celibate Rifles, inverted their name from the Sex
  Pistols. But, please. Weren’t the Dandy Warhols and their errant brothers in
  neo-psychedelia, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, enough already? Couldn’t we
  have given the great Camper Van Beethoven the last word? It was around the
  time Nick Murphy started making inroads on the charts as Chet Faker in the
  2010s that I really started thinking this shtick was getting beyond old hat.
  Maybe Murphy thought so too, because by 2016 he was releasing music under his
  own name. Unfortunately, when no one recognised him as his authentic self, he
  went back to Chet Faker. Much worse was to come, though. There’s Joy Orbison,
  Joanna Gruesome (ew) and most recently, British punk duo Bob Vylan. It’s long
  past time tribute names were left to actual tribute bands: Dread Zeppelin, Jäh
  Division, Mac Sabbath and so on. To all you other New Originals: get your own.
