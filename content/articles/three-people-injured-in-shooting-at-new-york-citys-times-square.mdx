  Three people have been injured in a shooting at New York City’s Times Square
  after a 17-year-old opened fire, the New York police department has said.
  Police said they were questioning one person who is being held in custody, but
  that no charges have been pressed yet. The shooting took place early on
  Saturday morning at about 1.20am on West 44th Street and 7th Avenue, an NYPD
  spokesperson said. Three people were injured: an 18-year-old woman, who was
  grazed in the neck; a 19-year-old man, who was shot in his right foot; and a
  65-year-old man, who was shot in the left leg. All three were taken to
  Bellevue hospital and are in a stable condition, the spokesperson said. There
  had been a verbal dispute between the shooter and one of the victims,
  according to the police. The firearm used in the shooting was recovered. Video
  on social media showed people fleeing from the scene, and police surrounding a
  vehicle and attending to the wounded lying on the ground. The shooting at the
  New York tourist spot took place amid a significant decrease in gun crime in
  the city. During the first seven months of 2025, the lowest number of shooting
  incidents in the city of 8.4 million people occurred since its records on gun
  crime began, according to the New York police commissioner, Jessica S Tisch.
  The city recorded 412 shooting incidents between January and July 2025. In
  fact, through 3 August, the city had registered a 23% drop in shootings when
  compared with the same period in the previous year.
