  New York City’s mayoral race is heating up, with Zohran Mamdani, the young
  progressive who leapt ahead of establishment figures in the primary to win the
  Democratic party nomination, appearing to widen his lead over his main rivals
  this week. Mamdani, 33, edged further ahead of the former New York state
  governor Andrew Cuomo, with the incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, far behind, in
  advance of the election this November to pick a leader for the largest city in
  the US. In a metropolis that leans Democratic, he was also far ahead of the
  Republican talkshow host Curtis Sliwa, and also another independent, the
  sky-diving former federal prosecutor Jim Walden. According to a poll released
  on Tuesday, Mamdani, who has been endorsed by fellow leftwingers on the
  national stage such as Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria
  Ocasio-Cortez, held a 19-point lead over Cuomo, his nearest rival. It was
  however, a small-scale survey, in which the Siena poll sampled just 317
  registered voters and cited an unusually wide 6.7% margin of error. Mamdani is
  a Muslim, which garnered some negative attacks ahead of the primary, and a
  member of the Democrat Socialists of America’s nine-member “State Socialists
  in Office” bloc in New York’s state assembly. Cuomo had been expected to win
  the Democratic primary, but despite his almost universal name recognition, he
  was beaten after being weighed down by an overly conventional campaign and a
  damaged political past having resigned as governor in a torrent of accusations
  of sexual harassment and bullying on the job. Mamdani was deemed on Tuesday by
  Siena to be 32 points ahead of Sliwa and held a 37-point lead over Adams, who
  has been plagued by allegations of corruption. With Mamdani as the candidate
  to beat, his credentials are now under attack and he has just four years under
  his belt as a state legislator. Cuomo has hit Mamdani for living in a
  rent-stabilized – or rent-regulated – apartment – where the rent is $2,500 a
  month when the market rate would be $3,000, while he earns $147,000 a year and
  is campaigning on housing affordability and calling for higher taxes for the
  wealthiest New Yorkers. Cuomo has accused Mamdani of “callous theft” and
  proposed a new means-test law, “Zohran’s Law”, that would control who gets to
  live in the city’s 1m rent-stabilized dwellings. The Mamdani campaign has said
  their candidate would have met Cuomo’s proposed qualify 30% rent-to-income
  standard when he moved in and was earning $47,000 a year, and described
  Cuomo’s proposal as “petty vindictiveness”. However, the Democratic strategist
  Hank Sheinkopf said the issue was an opening for New York City voters who are
  leaning against Mamdani. “It won’t move the numbers for younger people who are
  the base of his support, but the argument could benefit both Cuomo and Adams
  because it makes Mamdani look like a hypocrite,” he said. Mamdani, meanwhile,
  has launched a “Five Boroughs Against Trump” tour of the city, shifting his
  focus to what many Democratic New Yorkers could agree is the common enemy, the
  Republican US president. Trump has threatened to intervene in New York – a
  threat made vivid with the national guard now patrolling Washington DC’s
  streets – if Mamdani is elected, and Cuomo posted that that was likely to
  happen and that “Trump will flatten him like a pancake”. Sheinkopf said
  Mamdani’s switch to attacking Trump was a wise political strategy because it
  deflects from his lack of governing experience. “He can be beaten but the
  problem is will any of these guys be able to figure it out? Cuomo’s numbers
  have to be much lower for Adams to win, and Adams has to pick up momentum.
  “The only way he [Adams] can get the Black vote back is offer a mea culpa that
  he made some mistakes early on but argue that crime is down, education and job
  numbers are up, tourist numbers are great, but what I need is more time to
  make sure 85,000 new housing units already budgeted for come through,”
  Sheinkopf said. Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a state assembly Democrat whose
  district includes much of eastern Brooklyn, is among moderates who are coming
  aroundto the leftwinger and attended a Mamdani-led anti-Trump meeting on
  Tuesday. “Democrats, both moderate and progressive, are uniting around urgent
  issues like affordability, housing, and protecting our democracy,” Hermelyn
  said. • This article was amended on 13 and 14 August 2025. Andrew Cuomo is a
  former governor of New York state, not a former mayor as an earlier subheading
  said. Also, Hank Sheinkopf was referring to Eric Adams, not Zohran Mamdani, in
  a quote about needing to get the Black vote back; and the market rate for an
  apartment similar to Mamdani’s in Queens is $3,000 a month, not $8,000 a
  month.
