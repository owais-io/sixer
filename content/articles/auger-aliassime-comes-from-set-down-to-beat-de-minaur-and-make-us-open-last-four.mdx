  Félix Auger-Aliassime continued his sublime return to form at the US Open with
  another demonstration of his growing maturity as he held his nerve in the
  decisive moments of a messy, nerve-racking four-hour tussle to defeat the
  eighth seed Alex de Minaur 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5, 7-6 (4) and reach the
  semi-finals in New York. By pulling off one of the most significant victories
  of his career, Auger‑Aliassime has now reached the US Open semi-finals for a
  second time in his career, four years after his first semi-final in 2021. “It
  feels amazing. Four years ago, it feels like more, honestly,” he said. “It was
  a tough couple of years but it feels even better now to be back in the
  semi-finals.” Having scaled as high as No 6 in 2022, Auger-Aliassime has
  struggled in recent years with a number of injuries and confidence issues,
  those difficulties underlined by his ATP ranking of No 27. This year, he could
  not find his level at the biggest tournaments, losing before the third round
  of the first three grand slams of this year. His final match before the US
  Open was a 6-0, 6-2 battering by Jannik Sinner in Cincinnati, a defeat that
  could have hurt his confidence. In New York, however, everything has fallen
  into place for the Canadian. Auger-Aliassime had followed up his excellent
  four-set victory against the No 3 seed Alexander Zverev with a dominant
  performance in his straight sets win against Andrey Rublev, the 15th seed. He
  has been playing great tennis, pairing his devastating serve, forehand and
  athleticism with greater patience and intelligence around the court. However,
  even when confidence is high, the stratospheric stakes of grand slam tennis
  mean it is not always possible to play well. Sometimes it is important just to
  survive. The two players entered Arthur Ashe Stadium fully conscious of the
  massive opportunity ahead. While this match-up presented De Minaur with his
  best opportunity to finally break new ground and reach his first grand slam
  semi-final on his sixth attempt, Auger-Aliassime is trying to find his way
  back after a turbulent few years with injuries and faltering confidence. This
  occasion made for a tense, tumultuous tussle where neither could summon their
  best level for sustained periods and momentum constantly shifted. De Minaur
  led by a break in the second set before immediately losing serve for the first
  time in the match, then Auger‑Aliassime failed to serve out the third set. It
  seemed like a fifth set was on the cards as De Minaur served for the fourth,
  but Auger-Aliassime instead dragged himself back into the match and closed it
  out in four. By the final stages of each set, with the pressure at its
  highest, it was Auger-Aliassime who served well under pressure and was
  determined to take control of the points against a struggling De Minaur. “Just
  a lot of nerves today through the whole match,” Auger-Aliassime said after the
  match. “It wasn’t pretty at all times but that’s what grand slam matches are.
  Sometimes, some days you won’t feel your best but I was willing to dig really
  deep and do everything I can to stay here, right now.” It has now been a full
  decade since Auger-Aliassime first showed his promise reaching the
  quarter‑final of an ATP Challenger event at 14 years old. As the first of the
  2000s generation to make his move on the professional circuit, the hype was
  deafening. His career has undoubtedly been a massive success, and he has
  established himself as one of the best players in the world, but he wants
  more. This week represents a step towards the 25‑year-old living up to his
  enormous ambitions. As Auger-Aliassime celebrated a breakthrough victory, this
  was a crushing defeat for De Minaur. Despite his growing frustration with his
  inability to reach a major semi-final, four of his previous quarter-final
  opponents were established top five players, with the No 1 Jannik Sinner most
  recently dismantling him at the Australian Open in January. The only anomaly,
  Jack Draper here last year, has since reached those heights himself. In
  contrast to the dominant performances he faced in his previous encounters,
  this time he found himself against a lower-ranked opponent who was unable to
  find his best tennis under such pressure. This time, he simply could not
  handle the pressure. “It is very tough when you have worked so hard for
  something and you constantly are putting yourself in positions to, in a way,
  prove people wrong, right? But yet again, you kind of fall, and especially
  this time, it’s a tough one to take,” said de Minaur. “There is no beating
  around the bush. It’s one of those matches that I would love to play again.
  There are other times that the opponent has a lot to say, and I have played
  quarterfinals where I played Jannik, and he was just too good, right, and
  there’s not really much I could have done. But I feel like this one was on my
  racket, and it is a shame. I don’t know how I’ll handle it. I’m definitely, as
  of right now, seeing red, but yeah, I’ll get over it. It’s just tennis,
  right?”
