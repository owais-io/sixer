  Adelaide star Izak Rankine is under AFL investigation for allegedly using a
  homophobic slur during the game against Collingwood on Saturday night. The AFL
  confirmed on Monday that its integrity unit is looking into the alleged
  on-field incident. “The AFL is aware of an alleged matter with the Integrity
  Unit making enquiries,” a league spokesperson said. Adelaide have confirmed
  that one of their players is under investigation. “We are aware of an alleged
  matter involving one of our players in Saturday night’s game and we are in
  discussions with the AFL,” a club spokesperson said on Monday. The Crows
  defeated the Magpies to lock in a first finals campaign since 2017 and tighten
  their grip on top spot with one round remaining in the home and away season.
  Rankine has been critical to the Crows’ rise into premiership contention after
  the club finished 15th last year. The 25-year-old has averaged 20.5 disposals
  and booted 31 goals this season as his creative spark is a key to the Crows’
  success. Rankine is yet to play in a finals series after spending four seasons
  with Gold Coast before joining a rebuilding Adelaide at the end of 2022. But
  the resurgent Crows’ premiership hopes could face a huge blow as the AFL
  integrity unit looks into the alleged incident. “It’s obviously in the AFL’s
  hands and we will let them investigate and see what happens,” Adelaide captain
  Jordan Dawson said on Monday. The AFL has handed out suspensions ranging from
  three to five matches in the past two seasons to players found guilty of
  conduct unbecoming. West Coast’s Jack Graham was last month suspended for four
  matches for directing a “highly offensive” homophobic slur toward a GWS Giants
  opponent, after the Eagles player self-reported the incident. Sydney player
  Riak Andrew was suspended for five matches this season for a homophobic slur
  used in a VFL match against North Melbourne. Three AFL players were suspended
  for using homophobic slurs last year. Gold Coast defender Wil Powell (five
  matches) and Port Adelaide forward Jeremy Finlayson (three) were banned over
  incidents during AFL matches. St Kilda’s Lance Collard was handed a six-match
  penalty for “unprompted and highly offensive” slurs directed towards two
  Williamstown players in a VFL game.
