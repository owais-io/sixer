  Dogs dry humping humans, and whatever else they can get between their legs, is
  always good for a laugh – at least when we’re looking down on these adorable
  house pets, as they satisfy their base instincts, from above. Fixed, the
  filthy animated comedy unleashed on Netflix with a content warning that should
  apply to this review as much as the movie, both indulges in and tests our
  limits when it comes to that humour, largely by getting down (on all fours)
  and dirty with its hand-drawn canines. Here’s a movie with talking pets that
  rarely rises above a bull terrier’s vantage point. Humans remain mostly out of
  frame. We see their legs – a regular scene of the crime – but never their
  faces. In the opening minutes, we’re right there with Bull (voiced by Pitch
  Perfect’s Adam DeVine), the movie’s pudgy un-neutered protagonist, as he works
  hard to bust a nut on his household’s nana. The elderly woman is asleep on a
  sofa seat, her wrinkles sit still while he makes a mess of her stockings. The
  screen, and whatever objects are in its frame (like dog tags and dentures),
  rock to his rhythmic thrusting. His moans and Pornhub-rated gift for gab get
  louder with every back and forth, along with the squishing sound whenever he
  makes contact. It’s a raucous bit, made all the more hilarious and
  uncomfortable because of how long it lasts. And it raises the question: would
  this behaviour be as cute and tolerable in real life if we considered how much
  fun dogs were having, and if we gave them human character traits and facial
  expressions, which in those moments can come off as downright depraved? Fixed
  gets as much mileage as it can out of gags that largely centre on Bull’s
  gonads, with its entire narrative built around a wild night out when he
  discovers his owner’s plan to finally give him the snip. But that humour, and
  its shock value, wears thin in less time than it takes for Bull to satisfy his
  urges. The movie can be a little too self-satisfied with its premise, mixing
  R-rated humour with the kind of quaint animation style – bright colours and
  defined black outlines – we remember from more innocent times. Tellingly,
  co-writer and director Genndy Tartakovsky (of Samurai Jack and Hotel
  Transylvania fame) first pitched the idea in 2009, when something like this
  might have felt risque and rare. That was the same year The Hangover became an
  R-rated blockbuster comedy hinging on a similarly debauched premise, and more
  than a decade into South Park’s success as late-night cartoon fare explicitly
  made for adults. It’s also long before 2016’s The Secret Life of Pets and
  Sausage Party, the former being far more imaginative and adventurous when
  mapping out social hierarchies in the domesticated animal space, and the
  latter – with its foul-mouthed grocery items – taking raunchy feature
  animation to its furthest limits. The button pushing in South Park and Sausage
  Party also casts a wider net, regularly spilling over into socio- and
  geopolitics. I mean, South Park is rankling the Trump administration with far
  more pointed dick jokes. And who could forget the feuding bagel and lavash in
  Sausage Party, where the Israel-Palestine conflict was played out along
  shelf-space. Fixed, on the other hand, rarely breaks orbit from the fixations
  of pets and strays, or at least what we imagine those to be. Beyond the horny
  animal stuff: there’s marking their territory, sniffing each other’s behinds,
  chasing squirrels (the violence of which is yet another thing where the humour
  of it is met with the unsettling shock of what happens when the predators
  catch their prey) and philosophizing over the unending appeal of bouncy
  (tennis) balls. The limited scope often leaves Fixed feeling stretched and
  redundant, especially when we get to the umpteenth gag about Bull’s testicles,
  which he imagines having Napoleonic personalities of their own. But at the
  same time, the movie’s narrow obsession with Bull’s balls is meaningfully
  consistent with the story it is telling. Bull bases his entire personality on
  having testes, after all, so much so that he lords it over his dog park pals –
  Rocco (Idris Elba, doing wonderful work as a statuesque boxer licking his
  emotional wounds over being abandoned by his mother), Lucky (Bobby Moynihan as
  a beagle who can’t stop devouring cat litter) and Fetch (Fred Armisen as a
  dachshund dressed for Instagram likes). The loyal squadron tolerate Bull’s
  misguided arrogance and join along as he attempts to break free. They stumble
  through city back alleys and into a sordid sex club, which amuses with canine
  answers to pole dancing and orgies, while Bull tries to finally do the deed
  with something other than nana’s legs. As much as he derives his mojo from
  having balls, Bull is still so crippled with an inferiority complex that he
  can’t go all the way with fellow canines. That’s especially true when it comes
  to the show dog nextdoor, Honey, an Afghan hound voiced by Kathryn Hahn, who
  Bull adores but doesn’t think he can satisfy, despite her flirtatious
  advances. Their inhibited and surprisingly sentimental romance actually gives
  Fixed a bit of heart, leading Bull on a journey of self-discovery where he
  learns to let go of his balls and embrace everything he could become without
  them. Too bad it takes so long for Bull, and the movie, to heed that very
  lesson. Fixed is available on Netflix 13 August
