  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, may call a special election in November
  to begin the process of redrawing the state’s congressional maps in response
  to Texas’s plans to change its own maps to help Republicans keep their
  majority in the House of Representatives. Donald Trump is pushing Texas and
  other Republican-dominated states to carry out mid-decade redistricting that
  will favor the GOP and potentially stop Democrats from retaking control of the
  House in next year’s midterm elections. Governors in Democratic-led states
  have responded by warning they will move to redo their own maps if Texas goes
  ahead with its plans, which could create an additional five Republican-leaning
  districts. California is viewed as the best opportunity for Democrats to pick
  up seats through gerrymandering, but voters will first have to approve changes
  to an independent redistricting commission that was given the power to draw
  congressional districts in 2010. Speaking at a Thursday press conference,
  Newsom said “a special election would be called, likely to be the first week
  of November” to approve the changes. “We will go to the people of this state
  in a transparent way and ask them to consider the new circumstances, to
  consider these new realities,” the governor added. The party out of power
  typically regains control of the House in a president’s first midterm
  election, as the Republicans did under Joe Biden in 2022 and Barack Obama in
  2010, and Democrats did during Trump’s first term in 2018. Newsom argued that
  another two years of unified Republican control of Congress would be
  especially harmful for California, noting that Los Angeles residents were
  still waiting for lawmakers to approve aid from the wildfires that ravaged the
  region earlier this year. “They’re doing a midterm rejection of objectivity
  and independence, an act that we could criticize from the sideline, or an act
  that we can respond to in kind – fight fire with fire,” Newsom said. While
  Republicans could gain the most seats by redrawing Texas’s maps, Ohio, another
  red state, must also redraw its maps before next year’s election, and there’s
  talk of redistricting to the GOP’s advantage in Missouri and Indiana.
  Democrats are seen as having a more difficult path to improving their odds of
  winning the House majority through redistricting, often due to their states’
  embrace of independent commissions intended to draw fair congressional amps.
  Voters created the California citizens redistricting commission in 2008 to
  draw its legislative maps, and in 2010 expanded its powers to congressional
  districts. Newsom said, “We’re not here to eliminate the commission,” but
  rather to respond to what he described as “the rigging of the system by the
  president of the United States. “And it won’t just happen in Texas. I imagine
  he’s making similar calls all across this country. It’s a big deal. I don’t
  think it gets much bigger,” Newsom said.
