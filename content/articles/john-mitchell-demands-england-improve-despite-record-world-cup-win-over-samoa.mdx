  England’s victory over Samoa was a record Rugby World Cup win for the Red
  Roses but the head coach, John Mitchell, said “their basics let them down”
  during a period in the second half where they took their foot off the gas. The
  Red Roses raced to a 47-0 half-time lead but fumbled lineouts and had
  knock-ons which thwarted their momentum during the second half. Mitchell
  praised his team but said it was a task to keep up the pressure. Mitchell
  said: “Firstly, I thought the start was an energetic, very clinical start. I
  think as the game wore on and the scoreboard was building, it was always going
  to be this group’s challenge to stay in the process and build pressure. So
  there’s always something to fix in this game. Ultimately at the end of the day
  if you’re going to mark it hard, why didn’t we build pressure in that period?
  Maybe our basics let us down on those couple of occasions. We wouldn’t be
  human if we didn’t have something to fix.” Amongst the try-scorers was the
  fly-half and player of the match Helena Rowland, who also kicked 11 of 14
  conversions. The versatile back impressed Mitchell with her performance. “She
  was outstanding,” he said. “She’s got a great skillset. She drove the game
  really well. Communicated all week. You could tell that she was going to
  perform well and she did. A lot of the other girls fed off her direction. I
  thought she was down in the right end of the field when we needed to be there.
  She directed attack really well to allow us to go forward. She can hunt
  weakness pretty quickly through her pace. She was definitely an example of an
  outstanding triple threat.” England have been hit with a few injuries in this
  tournament with the captain, Zoe Aldcroft, ruled out for the game against
  Samoa and their final pool match against Australia. She isn’t the only worry
  with Emily Scarratt picking up a shoulder injury and Holly Aitchison dealing
  with an ankle problem. But Mitchell eased any fears of further issues, saying:
  “Naturally, we all need to go through our processes medically. But right at
  the minute it was not a lot that’s dangerous. “Injury gods haven’t been that
  kind to us at the start of the tournament, we have managed to get to this
  point. Getting minutes in to everyone except Holly, so hopefully we can
  continue with that good group health.”
