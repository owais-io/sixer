  It was only after Miles Pickering arrived at Scotland Yard following his
  arrest that the police realised they had got things embarrassingly wrong. The
  T-shirt worn by the Brighton engineer did not express support for a proscribed
  terrorist group, instead the words on it read “Plasticine Action” and inside
  the letter “o” was an image of the stop-motion character Morph giving two
  thumbs up. Speaking to the Guardian, Pickering admitted it was designed to be
  an easy mistake to make, appearing to look like the logo of Palestine Action,
  the protest group banned under terrorism legislation last month, but text
  underneath the logo reads: “We oppose AI-generated animation.” The arrest
  happened – one of 532 that day – at a protest in Parliament Square in London
  on 9 August, after a police officer glanced at his top. “I’m like: ‘Well,
  there you go, Plasticine Action.’ He looked down and he said: ‘Right, you’re
  nicked.’ And I thought: ‘Oh, here we go,’” said Pickering. Outside the Met
  police headquarters at what essentially was a pop-up booking suite made from
  two gazebos dealing with the large volume of arrested people, a large group of
  protesters cheered as people were brought in by officers. “They were all
  cheering us, and I was cheekily pointing to my T-shirt and going ‘Plasticine
  Action!’ to everyone, so they were taking photos of me, and everyone was
  laughing at how silly it was that I was getting arrested for being a
  plasticine terrorist,” Pickering said. He had been arrested under section 13
  of the Terrorism Act 2000, which makes it an offence to wear anything
  supporting a proscribed organisation. A senior officer asked the arresting
  officer if he could arrest Pickering under section 12, which could have
  brought a more serious charge of supporting a proscribed group. “[The
  arresting officer] said: ‘No, I can’t.’ And they said: ‘Why not?’ He said:
  ‘Because he hasn’t got Palestine Action written on him. He’s got Plasticine
  Action written on him.’” About five minutes later, the arresting officer
  approached him again. “He said: ‘I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.’ I
  said: ‘What’s the good news?’ He said: ‘I’m de-arresting you.’ “And I said:
  ‘What’s the bad news?’ He said: ‘It’s going to be really embarrassing for me.’
  And then I walked free, while all the real heroes are the people that are
  actually getting arrested.” Pickering has made copies of the T-shirt, which he
  is selling through his own website to raise money for the charity Medical Aid
  for Palestinians. It has sold in 28 countries already. “So there’s people
  getting on this one, because it kind of works, doesn’t it?” he said. “It’s
  like we are just going to mock you for your ridiculous decision to proscribe a
  protest group. It’s just so important that our rights to protest do not get
  diminished.” He said he expected there to be a number of people wearing the
  shirts on 6 September at the next organised protest against the ban on
  Palestine Action, and that he had been advised by the police that it could
  still be an arrestable offence. “How ridiculous is this?” he said, adding:
  “But if 1,000 people wander around the Palestinian march wearing a T-shirt
  that says Plasticine Action with a picture of Morph, what are they going to
  do?” Footage has also emerged of a man wearing the same T-shirt being arrested
  in Scotland during a demonstration on Saturday. In June, a Leeds man was
  arrested for holding up a printed out version of a joke from Private Eye, an
  incident that the satirical magazine’s editor, Ian Hislop, called
  “mind-boggling”. Pickering said that although he did care about AI ruining the
  animation industry, he was passionate about protesting for Gaza, and had seen
  support for the cause swell. He said he felt the tide of public opinion was
  turning, with more national news organisations showing images and video of the
  famine Israel was inflicting on the people of Gaza. “There’s no justification
  for it, and we all know it. I do think we’re winning. We’re going to win this
  battle, and Palestine will ultimately – as we’ve been shouting at people for
  so long – be free.” • This article was amended on 18 August 2025. Miles
  Pickering is selling copies of the T-shirt for charity through his website,
  not on Amazon as an earlier version suggested.
