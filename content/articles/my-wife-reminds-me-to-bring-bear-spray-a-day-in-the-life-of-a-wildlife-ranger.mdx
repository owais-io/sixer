  We’re often quick to celebrate when natural land is saved: a rainforest
  spared, a vital habitat conserved. But what happens if there’s nobody there to
  protect it? That’s a problem international conservation charity World Land
  Trust was aiming to solve when it set up its Keepers of the Wild programme,
  which provides salaries for rangers on partner reserves all over the world.
  “You need people there every day,” says Dan Bradbury, director of brand and
  communications at World Land Trust. He points out that those working as
  keepers of the wild are not only rangers but often firefighters, community
  organisers, medics, animal rescuers, research assistants and general
  guardians. Through the programme, those living in nearby villages are hired to
  protect natural heritage. Some are even former hunters. “They become amazing
  guides, because they know the forests,” says Bradbury. He offers the example
  of a Colombian bird hunter who once used his talent for mimicking bird calls
  to “whip away birds and take them to market”. Now employed as a keeper of the
  wild, he uses the same bird call, but for good, as a bird guide in the
  reserve. “They’re the peacemakers there, on the frontline of conservation,”
  says Bradbury. Located in Armenia, you’ll find the Caucasus Wildlife Refuge,
  created in 2011 by World Land Trust’s partner organisation, Foundation for the
  Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets (FPWC). There, Keepers of the
  Wild-funded rangers Boris Vanyan and Manuk Manukyan take on arduous and often
  perilous work as part of an award-winning ranger team. On a given day, they
  could deal with wildfires, armed intruders or animals injured by landmines.
  But, as they explain, the work comes with plenty of pinch-me moments among the
  leopards and lynxes, too. Here’s how Vanyan and Manukyan spend a typical day
  at work. Week-ahead preparation: marking out routes Vanyan: Before my workday
  even begins, we start planning. Friends call – shepherds or other community
  members – who may have seen something or heard something we should check out.
  Sometimes we finalise plans the day before. 5.30am: Get dressed, pack up
  Vanyan: Our clothes are light, with long sleeves for sun protection. Sturdy
  shoes are a must – there are many poisonous snakes. I pack binoculars,
  trap-cameras, food, a knife, and a first aid kit. I’ll even take needles in
  case something major happens and we need stitches. My wife reminds me to bring
  bear spray. Manukyan: Some people say that when you’re out in the wild, you
  should have a weapon in case a bear attacks. But there is no reason for a bear
  to attack if you know not to go into his den, or near his cubs. I’ll usually
  just pack trap-cameras, plus camera batteries and memory chips. 5.45am: Travel
  to work by horseback Vanyan: Depending on the plan, I take horses, walk or
  drive. That depends on the landscape. Our hours are according to wildlife, not
  what is comfortable to us – if the wildlife wakes up at 5.30am, we move with
  their schedule. 8am: Manukyan gathers local workers Manukyan: I wish I could
  start as early as 5am, but instead I go to the village to collect colleagues
  and guide them to the eco centre, where we have greenhouses, lodges and a bear
  rehabilitation centre. 10am: Vanyan patrols for threats Vanyan: There are
  three main threats to wildlife in this area. First, illegal poaching. Then
  there’s wildfires, which can mean animals migrate to areas that are dangerous
  to them, or they lose their habitat. The third is the many landmines on the
  border of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Crossing the mines, an animal could lose a
  limb, or could even be blown up. Manukyan: Recently, we had fires in three
  different places. A storm had begun destroying the juniper forests – the
  lightning was setting these ancient trees on fire. They have oil inside, and
  they burn like hell. But we have horses trained that can carry water up the
  mountain, and, together with the other rangers, the fire department and the
  state reserve, we managed to distinguish all three fires. 1pm: Lunch in the
  mountains Vanyan: Usually if I work close to home, I’ll go home for lunch, but
  I’m reluctant to take a break like this, because being in nature is the most
  relaxing thing. 2pm: Vanyan gets back to work Vanyan: I also manage tree
  planting for the reforestation programme in degraded areas of the Caucasus
  Wildlife Refuge – organising villagers, showing them where and how to plant.
  Sometimes we have to negotiate with locals who let their cattle roam, as they
  can eat the young trees, which can be a challenge. 6pm: Golden hour research
  Vanyan: In the evening, the mammals come with their youngsters to the wetland.
  I’ll hide somewhere near a watering hole and wait for them to turn up – golden
  hour is the best time to film the animals, such as the bezoar goats, with a
  very high zoom. Manukyan: Animals often recognise me. For a while there was a
  Eurasian lynx – very risk-averse animals – which I would spot, only from far
  away. One time we stood, just four or five metres apart, just looking at each
  other for a long time. I tried to take photos, but the clicking sound made him
  run off. I’ve observed him many times, in many places. There is also a herd of
  bezoar goats who pose when I’m coming to check the trap-camera. Vanyan: We
  recently spotted two different Caucasian leopards as far as 3km from one
  another, which is a very good sign – it shows that the leopards have enough
  prey to come and stay, to feel secure in the area and to roam. We also monitor
  for three species of vultures, and observe lots of bears. 7pm: Head back home
  – but sometimes not for long Manukyan: I’ll drop off my team and travel home.
  But I have a live camera on my phone, and I’m constantly checking it to see if
  there’s something alarming. One time, close to New Year’s Eve, we spotted a
  torchlight on the top of the mountain, and identified that it was people –
  with weapons. We immediately drove to the mountain – a 90-minute drive. I
  called the police and the rangers from the state reserve, and, of course
  Boris, and together, we encircled them. It turned out they were not armed with
  hunting guns, but military guns. Their guns were taken and there was a police
  case – it took the whole night, until 4am or 5am. This type of thing is quite
  usual – everything depends on the needs of nature. Manukyan: Sometimes I don’t
  see my three children for a few days at a time, because I come home after they
  go to bed, and leave before they wake up. When that happens, they demand I
  organise a barbecue! Vanyan: My son is nine, and he’s very proud. He wants to
  learn about everything, to see all the materials I’m gathering. Maybe someday
  he will come with me, maybe he’ll continue my journey. Manukyan: The real
  richness, the real value of this country is its biodiversity. It’s very
  important to understand that the love of a country starts from nature – from
  rivers to trees, and forests to wildlife. Everything we are keeping now is not
  only for us, but for future generations. You can support Rangers like Manuk
