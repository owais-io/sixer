  It is possible that Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq has chronic medical
  conditions, but the picture of him that the Guardian published leaves no doubt
  that he is also suffering from malnutrition (We published a photo of a
  malnourished child in Gaza. It made an impact globally – and created
  controversy, 6 August). David Collier implies that cerebral palsy might be the
  cause of this, but for many years paediatricians have rejected the belief that
  malnutrition is an inevitable consequence of this condition, or indeed of many
  other chronic diseases affecting children. Nutritional supplementation,
  delivered if necessary by feeding tube, has been shown to prevent or reverse
  malnutrition in children with cerebral palsy when appropriate nutritional
  needs are met. Of course, vulnerable children with chronic conditions are
  likely to be the first affected by the destruction of medical services,
  including unavailability of “specialist medical supplements”. This is hardly
  surprising given the blocking by Israel of aid shipments, including food and
  medical supplies, and the deliberate targeting of health infrastructure and
  staff. Even for those determined to find alternative explanations such as an
  undiagnosed genetic disorder, this picture certainly illustrates severe
  malnutrition. I would suggest that the most likely cause for this is now
  obvious to most people. Dr John Puntis Retired paediatric consultant
  gastroenterologist, Leeds • Would Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq’s bones
  be so visible if he was living anywhere other than Gaza? How about if he was
  living a few miles across the border in Israel? I think we all know the answer
  to that. But clearly there are some individuals (no doubt well-fed
  individuals) for whom even this needs spelling out. Yes, that’s right, Gazan
  children with health conditions do lose weight when denied food, just as much
  as those born healthy. And let’s not call it a man-made famine. Let’s please
  call it as it is: an Israeli-made famine. Shirin Fareed Twickenham, London •
  Many of my wife’s Jewish family and of mine were victims of the Holocaust. The
  world remained largely silent. We were among the few who were reluctantly
  given asylum in New Zealand. The Jewish cry “Never again!” is more than
  justified. It has not been heeded. With the western world’s complicity, the
  victims now are the people of Palestine, robbed of their ancestral land,
  massacred in the tens of thousands, tortured in Israel’s prisons, threatened
  with expulsion, starved by design (‘We are dying slowly, save us’: starvation
  takes hold in Gaza after a week of appalling milestones, 2 August), treated as
  less than human – all this in defiance of international law. The belated
  recognition of a Palestinian state is no more than window-dressing for as long
  as the Palestine that was remains under cruel military occupation. The time
  for measured language is well past. It is time for action. Sanctions ended
  apartheid South Africa. Archbishop Tutu held Israel’s crimes to be worse. Nato
  acted in Kosovo. Why not in Gaza? Is the last word to be left with the White
  House as children go on dying? I write as a former chair of Amnesty
  International UK, one of the many NGOs now naming the genocide for what it is.
  Peace Now is possible, with the necessary political will. Canon Dr Paul
  Oestreicher and Prof Barbara Einhorn Wellington, New Zealand • While I agree
  with much of what Hussein Agha and Robert Malley say (France and Britain’s
  recognition of a Palestinian state won’t stop Israel’s onslaught, 30 July),
  the public intention to give symbolic recognition to Palestine by France and
  others, and possibly the UK, is nevertheless a positive step forward. It sends
  the clear message, from some of the more powerful states in international
  politics, that the Palestinian people do deserve the right to
  self-determination. The act of international recognition points to the lack of
  – and urgent need for – territory, government and sovereignty for
  Palestinians, whether in a one-state (“dignified coexistence”), federal-state
  or two-state model. Both Israel and Palestine deserve the right to
  self-determination, and that is an achievable goal, however repellent to the
  current Israeli government. Dr Raia Browning Oxford • I read your article with
  shock as well as horror (The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a
  famine in Gaza, 31 July). What a devastating exposure of the chillingly
  callous use of deliberately finely tuned starvation, behind which surely lies
  a cruelty that many will struggle to understand. Peter Millen Huddersfield,
  West Yorkshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian
