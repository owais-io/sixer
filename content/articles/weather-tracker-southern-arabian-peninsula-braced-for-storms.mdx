  Unusual levels of rainfall are due to hit the southern Arabian peninsula this
  week, as a tropical wave – an elongated area of low pressure – progresses
  across the region, triggering a marked increase in convective activity across
  western Yemen and south-western Saudi Arabia this week. There is a risk of
  thunderstorms until Wednesday, with forecast rainfall totals reaching about
  50mm for Al Hudaydah region in Yemen and the Jazan province of Saudi Arabia.
  Although 50mm is not a particularly large rainfall total in most places, in
  this region it is enormous: Al Hudaydah typically records only 65mm annually,
  while Jazan averages about 150mm. Orographic enhancement – when air rising
  over mountains or other upland terrain can invigorate or produce areas of
  heavy rain – along the Red Sea coastal escarpments further amplifies the risk
  of high rainfall totals here and this, combined with the arid surface
  conditions, brings a significant risk of flash flooding; runoff from upland
  rainfall is efficiently channelled into valleys, often toward more densely
  populated coastal settlements. Hail and strong outflow winds are likely from
  these thunderstorms, with the outflow winds potentially producing short-lived
  but impactful intense dust storms owing to the dry desert terrain, leading to
  sudden reductions in visibility and localised transport disruption. While the
  impacts are likely to be reserved for the Red Sea coast, there is a suggestion
  that moisture transferred from the Arabian Sea in association with this
  tropical wave could extend further inland, with the potential for rare
  rainfall within the Rub’ al-Khali (Empty Quarter) desert. Meanwhile, Hurricane
  Erin tracked across the Caribbean over the weekend and is now progressing on a
  northward path following the US east coast. Erin underwent a rapid and
  significant intensification phase on Saturday, strengthening from category 1
  to category 5, with US Air Force hurricane hunters recording sustained winds
  of 160mph. Not only is Erin the first of the five named storms this hurricane
  season to reach hurricane status but it jumped straight to the strongest
  category of storms on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Thankfully the category 5
  status was short-lived, and Erin passed north of Puerto Rico and the British
  Virgin Islands on Sunday before adopting the gradual northward trajectory on
  Sunday night. While the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands have escaped
  the impacts of the hurricane, many islands over the coming days are expected
  to face large ocean swells, strong winds and heavy rainfall. Erin’s
  extratropical remnants may influence the UK during the late August bank
  holiday weekend, particularly on Monday, as the system accelerates
  north-eastwards and is steered by the jet stream. By this stage, Erin will
  have completed its extratropical transition – known as an ex-hurricane in name
  – and impacts are expected to be limited to periods of wet and windy weather
  across north-west Europe.
