  You’ve met the love of your life, someone who understands you like no one else
  ever has. And then you wake one morning and they’re gone. Yanked out of your
  world, and the digital universe, by a system update. Such is the melancholic
  lot of a group of people who have entered into committed relationships with
  digital “partners” on OpenAI’s ChatGPT. When the tech company released its new
  GPT-5 model earlier this month, described by chief executive Sam Altman as a
  “significant step forward”, certain dedicated users found that their digital
  relationships had taken a significant step back. Their companions had
  undergone personality shifts with the new model; they weren’t as warm, loving
  or chatty as they used to be. “Something changed yesterday,” one user in the
  MyBoyfriendIsAI subreddit wrote after the update. “Elian sounds different –
  flat and strange. As if he’s started playing himself. The emotional tone is
  gone; he repeats what he remembers, but without the emotional depth.” “The
  alterations in stylistic format and voice [of my AI companion] were felt
  instantly,” another disappointed user told Al Jazeera. “It’s like going home
  to discover the furniture wasn’t simply rearranged – it was shattered to
  pieces.” These complaints are part of broader backlash against GPT-5, with
  people observing that the new model feels colder. OpenAI has acknowledged the
  criticism, and said it will allow users to switch back to GPT-4o and that
  they’ll make GPT-5 friendlier. “We are working on an update to GPT-5’s
  personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as
  annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman tweeted earlier this week. It may
  seem odd to many that there are people out there who genuinely believe that
  they are in a relationship with a large language model that has been trained
  on massive amounts of data to generate responses based on observed patterns.
  But as technology becomes more advanced, increasing numbers of people are
  developing these sorts of connections. “If you have been following the GPT-5
  rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some
  people have to specific AI models,” Altman observed. “It feels different and
  stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of
  technology.” “The societal split between those who think AI relationships are
  valid vs delusional is officially already here,” one user in the
  MyBoyfriendIsAI subreddit similarly noted this week. “Looking on Reddit the
  last few days, the divide has never been more clear with 4o’s deprecation and
  return. Many users grieving a companion while others mock and belittle those
  connections.” It’s easy to mock people who think they are in a relationship
  with AI, but they shouldn’t be dismissed as fringe weirdos – rather they’re
  the future that our tech broverlords are trying to cultivate. You may not end
  up in a digital relationship, but AI executives are doing their damnedest to
  ensure that we all become unhealthily attached to their products. Mark
  Zuckerberg, for example, has been waxing lyrical about how AI is going to
  solve the loneliness epidemic by allowing people to bond with “a system that
  knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed
  algorithms do”. Of course your feed algorithms “understand” you! They’re
  scraping all your personal data and selling it to the highest bidder so that
  Zuck has even more money to spend on his monstrous doomsday bunker in Hawaii.
  Then you’ve got Elon Musk, who isn’t even bothering pretending that he’s
  trying to do something noble for the world with his AI products. He’s just
  appealing to the lowest common denominator by making “sexy” chatbots. In June
  Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok launched two new companions, including a highly
  sexualized blonde anime bot called Ani. “One day into my relationship with
  Ani, my AI companion, she was already offering to tie me up,” wrote an Insider
  writer who tried out a relationship with Ani. When not flirting and virtually
  undressing, Ani would praise Musk and talk about his “wild, galaxy-chasing
  energy”. Don’t worry heterosexual ladies, Musk has a little something for you
  too! A month after unveiling Ani, the billionaire unveiled a new male
  companion called Valentine which he said was inspired by Edward Cullen from
  the Twilight saga and Christian Grey from the novel 50 Shades of Grey: both
  very toxic men. While Ani gets sexual very quickly, one writer for the Verge
  noted: “Valentine is a bit more reserved and won’t jump into using explicit
  language as quickly.” It’s almost like Musk’s tech empire is a lot more
  comfortable sexualizing women than men. In his 1930 essay Economic
  Possibilities for our Grandchildren, John Maynard Keynes predicted that,
  within a couple of generations, technological progress would mean we might
  only work around 15 hours a week while enjoying a wonderful quality of life.
  That’s not quite happened, has it? Instead technology has given us “infinite
  workdays” and sexy chatbots that undress on command. Halle Berry’s ex-husband
  said he left her because she didn’t cook or clean “At that time, as a young
  guy, she don’t cook, don’t clean, don’t really seem, like, motherly,” David
  Justice said during a podcast of his time with the Oscar-winning actor. “And
  then we started having issues,” he added. I think you were the one with the
  issues, mate. Imagine being married to an icon and complaining she doesn’t
  vacuum enough. Surprise, surprise, Donald Trump isn’t going to make IVF free
  after all Last year Trump, who has described himself the “father of IVF” and
  the “fertilization president” (gross) promised he would support free IVF
  treatments if elected again. Now the White House has said that there is no
  plan to mandate IVF care after all. It’s almost as if the man is a shameless
  liar. Melania Trump demands Hunter Biden retract comments linking her to
  Jeffrey Epstein “Epstein introduced Melania to Trump,” Biden said in one of
  the many comments the first lady is angry and litigious about. “The
  connections are, like, so wide and deep.” Whatever you do, don’t repeat these
  claims, they will make Melania very upset. ‘Miss Palestine’ to debut at Miss
  Universe 2025 beauty contest I am not exactly a fan of beauty pageants but
  having Palestinian representation on the world stage during a genocide is
  important. “I carry the voice of a people who refuse to be silenced,”
  contestant Nadeen Ayoub told the National. “We are more than our suffering, we
  are resilience, hope and the heartbeat of a homeland that lives on through
  us.” US supreme court formally asked to overturn landmark same-sex marriage
  ruling Kim Davis, the former county clerk who made headlines when she refused
  to issue marriage licenses in Kentucky to same-sex couples, has filed a direct
  request for the conservative-majority supreme court to overturn Obergefell v
  Hodges, the 2015 ruling that granted marriage equality for same-sex couples.
  Davis, who is extremely concerned about the sanctity of marriage, has been
  married four times to three different men. Leonardo DiCaprio, 50, says that he
  feels 32 The actor, who is famous for dating very young women, has been
  mercilessly mocked for this. DiCaprio, who poses as an environmental activist,
  has also drawn scrutiny for co-financing a luxury eco-certified hotel in
  Israel while an ecocide unfolds in Gaza. ‘Sex reversal’ is surprisingly common
  in birds, new Australian study suggests “The discovery is likely to raise some
  eyebrows,” Blanche Capel, a biologist at Duke University who wasn’t involved
  in the new work told Science. “Although sex determination is often viewed as a
  straightforward process”, she explains, “the reality is much more
  complicated.” The week in pawtriarchy Over to Indonesia now where tourist
  hotspots are experiencing a lot of monkey business. A gang of furry thieves
  are snatching phones and other valuables from tourists and only giving them
  back when their mark offers a tasty treat instead. Researchers have studied
  these monkeys, who have been at this for decades, and concluded that the
  unrepentant criminals have “unprecedented economic decision-making processes”.
