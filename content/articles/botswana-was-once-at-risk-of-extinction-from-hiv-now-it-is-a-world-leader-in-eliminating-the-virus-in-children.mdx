  At the turn of the century, HIV was so rampant in Botswana that politicians
  and doctors viewed it as an existential threat. One in eight infants were
  reported to be infected at birth, while rates of mother to child transmission
  either through pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding ranged from between 20
  and 40%, according to UNAIDS. Between 1990 and 2000, mortality among children
  under five almost doubled due to HIV. With a population of just 1.7 million
  people, no cure available and the second-highest HIV prevalence in the world,
  the country’s then-president, Festus Mogae, declared in 2001: “We are
  threatened with extinction.” “The situation was dire,” says Dr Loeto Mazhani,
  a now-retired paediatrician, public health official and academic at the
  University of Botswana. “If your whole population was infected in utero, at
  birth or during early infancy, and the majority of them [were] either dying or
  living with significant disability, you could see there was no future.” But
  out of this crisis would emerge one of the world’s most successful
  HIV-elimination programmes. Spearheaded by Mazhani, with backing from Mogae, a
  series of pioneering interventions were introduced which, over the course of
  two decades, slashed rates of mother-to-child transmission to just below 1%.
  Earlier this year, Botswana was recognised as the first country in the world
  with a high HIV-burden to achieve the World Health Organization’s Gold Tier
  status for eliminating mother-to-child – or “vertical” – HIV transmission as a
  public health threat. Dr Ava Avalos, an HIV specialist and technical adviser
  to Botswana’s health ministry, says the transformation was so drastic that the
  WHO initially refused to believe the figures that were coming out of the
  country. “We would report that our birth numbers [of HIV infections] were so
  low, and they’d say, ‘No, no, you have 10,000 children that are [HIV]
  positive,’” she says. “And this went on for years until they had to accept the
  fact that Botswana’s programme was as strong as we were saying.” Today, new
  paediatric infections are so rare – with fewer than 100 HIV-positive infants
  born annually – that each case is subject to a thorough audit to understand
  how it happened. Reaching this point required both significant political will,
  investment in scientific infrastructure and a sustained public health
  education programme to bring the latest science-backed strategies to those
  most at risk. Mazhani recalls how one of the biggest challenges was convincing
  HIV-positive mothers to use formula milk rather than breastfeeding, due to the
  risks of transmission – something that went against conventional wisdom for
  infant nutrition. “It meant that if a woman started getting formula milk,
  everyone in the community would know that she has HIV,” he says. “Mothers felt
  ostracised. But over time, that stigma of formula feeding slowly reduced.”
  Roger Shapiro, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the
  Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, has run an HIV research programme in
  Botswana since the 1990s. He says a particular turning point was the decision
  in 2013 to implement the WHO’s Option B+ strategy – making antiretroviral
  therapy that combined three drugs freely available to all pregnant and
  breastfeeding women living with HIV. At the time, Botswana was one of the
  first countries in the world to fund Option B+ on a national scale. “It became
  clear that three-drug therapy was by far the best way to both treat mothers
  for their health, and essentially turn off vertical transmission,” says
  Shapiro. Research, however, still indicated that these steps alone were not
  sufficient to completely prevent paediatric infections. Studies showed that a
  significant number of mother-to-child transmissions occurred when mothers
  unknowingly contracted HIV during pregnancy, with the unborn child becoming
  infected in the third trimester. To eliminate these cases, Botswana’s health
  ministry invested in two laboratories in the north and south of the country
  capable of analysing thousands of PCR tests and began offering repeat HIV
  testing to all pregnant women. According to Joseph Makhema, an internal
  medicine specialist who heads the Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, this
  enabled women who tested positive to be swiftly placed on antiretrovirals and
  post-exposure prophylaxis drugs to limit the possibility of transmission to
  the baby. While other sub-Saharan African countries, notably Malawi, Rwanda,
  Zambia and Zimbabwe, now also offer widespread HIV testing for pregnant women,
  Shapiro says that Botswana’s programme is particularly effective because of
  the near-universal antenatal coverage in the country, with the vast majority
  of women accessing services and giving birth in hospital rather than at home.
  Max Kapanda, who heads Botswana’s antiretroviral treatment programme, says:
  “This also allows all babies born to HIV-positive women to be immediately
  tested, and if infected, started on treatment as early as possible.” Such is
  the success of this testing regime that there is now a unique group of
  children and adolescents with HIV in Botswana who are thought to have
  suppressed the virus to nearly negligible levels, having been on
  antiretroviral medications since birth. At the recent International Aids
  Society conference in Rwanda, researchers discussed how these children are
  ideal candidates for experimental trials that attempt to use emerging
  treatments to cure them completely of HIV. Makhema says: “We think that if you
  treat children early, you’re catching them before the virus has seeded through
  different bodily tissues or infected a particular type of immune cell called
  memory cells, and become encoded in the gene pool. So, hypothetically at
  least, it should be easier to cure these children.” This theory is now being
  tested in a landmark clinical trial in Botswana, which will see about 30
  children receive regular infusions of broadly neutralising antibodies or
  bNAbs, a new class of HIV drugs capable of attacking different strains of HIV
  and stimulating the immune system to recognise them, over the course of 11
  months. It is hoped that after this time period, a certain number of children
  will be able to live long-term without requiring any drug treatment at all, in
  effect rendering them cured. “We’re hoping there’s two ways they could be
  cured,” says Shapiro, who is leading the trial. “They could either be cured
  because there’s no more intact virus left or because their immune system is
  able to handle the small amount that remains.” While a cure has long been HIV
  researchers’ ultimate goal, the importance of such trials has taken on an even
  greater weight both in Botswana and more widely across sub-Saharan Africa in
  recent months in the wake of foreign aid cuts and economic turmoil. While
  Botswana’s HIV programme has been more resilient than most – both
  antiretroviral treatment and testing has long been funded by the government –
  the country is experiencing an economic downturn and was initially facing 37%
  tariffs imposed by the Trump administration before they were cut to 15% last
  month. “Botswana’s economy is very diamond-based,” says Avalos. “But there’s a
  lot now about the diamond industry which is challenging, with the rise of
  synthetic diamonds and the current situation with tariffs. “It means our HIV
  programme is much more precarious. Previously if we ever had [treatment or
  testing] shortages, foreign partners would be able to assist us, but now those
  systems are not there.” According to Makhema, it is unlikely that Botswana
  will be able to maintain its investment in HIV prevention and treatment over
  the long-term, making it all the more urgent to identify a strategy for curing
  infected individuals. But given the country’s success in virtually eliminating
  mother-child transmissions, the availability of infrastructure required to
  support clinical trials, and a suitable population of children who may have
  the best chance of being cured, there is optimism that if a cure breakthrough
  can be achieved anywhere, it is most likely to happen in Botswana. “If we
  can’t manage it here, I don’t know where we could do it,” says Avalos.
