  North Korea: Kim Jong-un’s daughter makes international debut fuelling
  succession speculation

  The appearance of Kim Jong-un’s daughter in China ahead of Xi Jinping’s
  “victory day” parade in Beijing has added to speculation that she is being
  groomed to become the first female ruler of North Korea. Photos released by
  North Korean state media showed Kim Ju-ae, who is believed to be in her early
  teens, stepping off her father’s heavily armoured train in the Chinese
  capital, where she was greeted by Chinese officials at the start of her debut
  on the international stage. But Ju-ae, whose name and age the regime has never
  publicly confirmed, is no stranger to the spotlight, having accompanied Kim on
  numerous official duties around North Korea, including the test launches of
  ballistic missiles and, more recently, the opening of Wonsan Kalma, a resort
  on the country’s east coast. If, as many analysts believe, Ju-ae is her
  father’s preferred successor, she would become the fourth member of the Kim
  family to rule North Korea since it was founded by her great-grandfather, Kim
  Il-sung, in 1948. First identified by the former NBA star Dennis Rodman – a
  friend of Kim who claimed to have held his then baby daughter during a visit
  to Pyongyang in 2013 – Ju-ae has not spoken in public, but is has become a
  near-permanent fixture in her father’s entourage, alongside his influential
  sister and confidante, Kim Yo-jong. North Korea’s tightly controlled state
  media had not carried reports about any of Kim’s children until Ju-ae was
  first seen accompanying him at the launch of an intercontinental ballistic
  missile in 2022. Several months later, Ju-ae attended a parade marking a
  founding anniversary of the Korean People’s Army, and state media began
  referring to her as Kim’s “respected” daughter. According to a 2017 report by
  South Korea’s intelligence service, Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, have three
  children: a son born in 2010, a daughter born in 2013 who is thought to be
  Ju-ae and, in 2017, a child whose gender has not been confirmed. In Beijing, a
  smiling Ju-ae, dressed in a navy blue suit, was seen standing behind her
  father as he stepped off their train after an overnight journey from
  Pyongyang, at the start of their first overseas trip together. Analysts said
  her attendance at an event that appeared to confirm the formation of a new,
  yet vaguely defined, anti-western alliance has added weight to the theory that
  she is Kim Jong-un’s heir apparent. “Right now, Ju-ae is the frontrunner as
  next supreme leader of North Korea,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea
  leadership expert at the US-based Stimson Center. “She is getting practical
  protocol experience which should serve her well as North Korea’s next leader
  or a core elite.” “She is getting valuable experience greeting and interacting
  with foreign leadership and other elites.” There is no evidence that Kim
  Jong-un ever accompanied his father, Kim Jong-il, on overseas trips, although
  the North’s former leader was reportedly reluctant to fly – a phobia his son
  does not appear to have inherited. In 2024, South Korea’s intelligence agency
  said it believed Ju-ae was being prepared to take on the leadership, although
  how and when that could happen remains unclear. Future leaders, including Kim
  Jong-un, usually work their way through the regime’s power structure, taking a
  number of senior posts in preparation for becoming head of state. It is
  unclear, too, how ruling party and military elites would react to the
  elevation of a woman to the position of supreme leader. Despite longstanding
  struggles with his weight and, in 2014, an apparent attack of gout – Kim, who
  is thought to be 41 or 42, has been in seemingly good health since speculation
  swirled over the reason behind his weeks-long absence from public life at the
  start of the Covid-19 pandemic. But there is little doubt that Ju-ae’s role
  has taken on greater significance in recent months, including attending a war
  anniversary event at the Russian embassy in Pyongyang in May. “The scope of
  her public appearances certainly has expanded from military-related sites to
  political and economic events over the years,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a
  researcher at the Stimson Center. “If this is part of a succession campaign,
  this would certainly help with that effort as it would be seen as Kim Ju-ae’s
  debut on the international stage.” Reuters contributed reporting
