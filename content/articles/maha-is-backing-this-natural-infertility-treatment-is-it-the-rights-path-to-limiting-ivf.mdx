  For Erica L and her husband, in-vitro fertilization was the “nuclear option”.
  After two years of trying to conceive, Erica and her husband had no idea why
  they could not have a baby. Doctors said only that they had “unexplained
  infertility”, a non-diagnosis of a diagnosis that is given to an estimated 15%
  of people trying to conceive. Erica was not ideologically opposed to trying
  IVF, but felt daunted by the price and unpredictability. Then Erica stumbled
  across a clinic that specialized in “restorative reproductive medicine”, or
  RRM. The clinic did bloodwork on Erica and her husband and urged them to eat
  well-balanced foods and take supplements, as well as prioritize exercise and
  sleep. Erica also started tracking her temperature and menstrual cycle in
  intense detail. “We wanted to do everything that we could to try to have a
  baby as naturally as possible,” said Erica, who asked that her full last name
  not be published. “There’s a lot of invasive things that I just wasn’t
  comfortable with.” Restorative reproductive medicine is a decades-old name for
  a constellation of therapies that are meant to revive the “natural” fertility
  of people trying to conceive. Often, RRM entails prescriptions for hormones,
  supplements and lifestyle changes - such as adopting a better diet - as well
  as closely analyzing one’s menstrual cycle. Its practitioners also sometimes
  use aggressive surgeries to root out endometriosis, a common and chronic
  condition that occurs when tissue that is similar to uterine tissue grows
  outside of the uterus. And, critically, RRM practitioners avoid the use of
  assisted reproductive technology such as IVF. Top Republicans, rightwing
  organizations and even White House officials have recently begun to rally
  behind RRM, seizing on its promise to enhance fertility without resorting to
  IVF. Many anti-abortion conservatives revile IVF because it can create unused
  embryos – a practice they see as unethical, if not murderous, as they believe
  life begins at conception. Yet IVF remains staggeringly popular, to the point
  that Donald Trump pledged to make it free in the wake of a 2024 Alabama
  supreme court decision that imperiled the procedure. Now, conservatives are
  trying to pare back that commitment – and some fertility doctors, including
  ones who offer RRM, worry that the right is co-opting RRM as a Trojan horse in
  order to sell a fertility agenda to voters while undermining IVF. Backed by
  several high-profile anti-abortion groups, Republicans in Congress have
  repeatedly introduced legislation to bolster government-funded research and
  education on RRM. In March, the Heritage Foundation – the influential
  thinktank behind the notorious Project 2025 – released a 63-page report that
  endorsed RRM and slammed IVF. Then, in July, the Department of Health and
  Human Services posted a notice soliciting applications for a $1.5m grant to
  fund an “infertility training center” that would expand access to resources
  for “holistic infertility treatments” rather than assisted reproductive
  technology. In August, the Washington Post reported that the Trump
  administration is backing away from the president’s campaign promises about
  IVF, although a White House spokesperson rebutted that claim. Dr Kaylen
  Silverberg is a reproductive endocrinologist who has advised administration
  officials, including Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles, about IVF. During his
  discussions with officials, Silverberg said he was asked about RRM. “I’ve been
  doing this for 31 years, and I’d never even heard the term,” said Silverberg,
  who is also advisory board chair of the advocacy group Americans for IVF. “So
  I started doing research about it. I realized that restorative reproductive
  medicine is just a pseudonym for a basic infertility evaluation.” Silverberg’s
  view is shared by many mainstream fertility doctors and organizations, who say
  that the difference between their work and RRM is less scientific than
  ideological. In their view, RRM is a rebranded version of everyday fertility
  medicine, minus IVF. RRM, with its focus on optimizing the body’s “natural”
  rhythms, is tapping into a growing interest in holistic health and wellness –
  one that is being increasingly politicized and expertly leveraged by the “Make
  America Healthy Again” (Maha) movement. But support for RRM alone, Silverberg
  said, cannot fulfill Trump’s campaign promises. “The problem is going to be if
  – and this is a big if – anybody tries to limit expansion of fertility access
  and care and coverage to restorative reproductive medicine.” *** ‘There is
  another option’ RRM is not a monolith. Some of its leading organizations and
  adherents take no position on IVF and reject the idea that RRM is
  ideologically driven or a new name for old medicine. Instead, they are drawn
  to RRM’s stance that infertility is not itself a disease but a symptom of
  something else that has gone wrong. Established in 2000, the International
  Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine (IIRRM), the preeminent group
  championing RRM, maintains a registry of RRM clinicians and collects data
  about its techniques’ efficacy. Dr Monica Minjeur, who was trained in family
  medicine and serves as the US director of communications and development for
  the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said RRM is
  “not an anti-IVF movement”. As far as Minjeur knows, no one in Congress has
  approached the institute to discuss RRM. “We will never say: ‘IVF should go
  away.’ We just mostly want people to realize: ‘Hey, there is another option,’
  because so many couples are told IVF is your only option,” said Minjeur, who
  added that she is a Democrat. Some RRM advocates and groups do oppose IVF and
  have long aligned themselves with conservative causes such as the
  anti-abortion movement. One of the most well-known RRM techniques is NaPro
  Technology, which usually involves such tactics as cervical mucus tracking and
  has been pioneered by the anti-abortion Saint Paul VI Institute since the
  1980s, when the Vatican condemned IVF. The institute’s website presents NaPro
  Technology as an alternative to IVF, which it calls “a highly abortive
  technology that often forces women to make abortion-related decisions”. In
  June, a new thinktank, the Maha Institute, held a roundtable discussion about
  women’s health and fertility. In her introduction to the discussion, Maureen
  Ferguson, a commissioner for the US Commission on International Religious
  Freedom with longstanding ties to the anti-abortion movement, sang RRM’s
  praises. “Traditional women’s health and fertility care has relied heavily on
  big pharma bandaids and workarounds that circumvent a women’s reproductive
  system,” Ferguson said. “Women of all political stripes appreciate healthcare
  that works in harmony with their body and restores health.” IIRRM wants to
  harness Maha advocates’ enthusiasm but is wary of being equated with the
  movement, according to Minjeur and Dr Tracey Parnell, the institute’s global
  director of communications and development. They described RRM and Maha as two
  sides of a Venn diagram. “We want to bring increased health to women and men
  and families,” Minjeur said of Maha. “Beyond that, there are definitely a fair
  amount of differences.” Parnell added: “We really truly are open to quite
  broad collaboration without being co-opted.” *** The rise of wellness culture
  The Make America Healthy Again movement is perhaps the best illustration of a
  broader push within American conservatism to incorporate the historically
  leftwing language of holistic health and “natural” treatments – in short,
  “wellness” – to advocate for traditionally rightwing aims, such as convincing
  women to have big families. This push started to gain steam in the years after
  the Covid pandemic, as trust in mainstream medicine started to falter: a
  survey of nearly half a million US adults found that trust in physicians and
  hospitals declined from roughly 72% to just 40% between April 2020 – the month
  after the pandemic broke out – and January 2024. As trust eroded, the wellness
  industry exploded. Between 2019 and 2023, it grew from $5.3tn to $6.32tn,
  according to the Global Wellness Institute, which defines wellness as the
  ongoing and individual pursuit of “optimal holistic health and wellbeing”.
  “Wellness” can encapsulate a wide range of activities, from undeniably healthy
  behaviors (such as exercising and eating nutritious foods) to practices that
  may be dangerous (such as drinking raw milk). These activities are yoked
  together by a deceptively simple ethos, according to Amy Larocca, author of
  the book How to Be Well: Navigating Our Self-Care Epidemic, One Dubious Cure
  at a Time. “In wellness, things that are natural are superior to things that
  are not,” Larocca explained. Wellness’s sales pitch can be particularly
  appealing to Americans, given the astronomical costs of traditional healthcare
  in the US. A single IVF cycle can run tens of thousands of dollars and most
  states do not require insurers to cover it. By contrast, countries such as
  Denmark and Sweden cover vast swathes of fertility treatments, including IVF.
  RRM treatments tend to cost far less than IVF, and may soon get even cheaper.
  In June, Arkansas’s Republican-dominated state legislature became the first in
  the country to pass a law requiring state insurance to cover RRM therapies.
  But critics say there is little quality evidence that RRM is more effective at
  helping people have babies than mainstream fertility medicine. The American
  Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and
  Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the Society of
  Gynecologic Surgeons are worried that other states may follow Arkansas’s lead;
  last week, the medical organizations sent a letter to urging the National
  Governors Association to reject pro-RRM legislation. Women’s health and
  infertility are especially ripe breeding groups for wellness because
  mainstream medicine routinely fails to take either seriously. Between 2013 and
  2023, just 8.8% of research funded by the National Institutes of Health
  focused on women’s health. Women are also more likely to have their medical
  concerns dismissed. When women and people of color show up at emergency rooms
  with signs of chest pain, they usually wait longer; women are also less likely
  to be admitted. *** ‘Many sobbing women’ A year after Erica started working
  with the restorative reproductive medicine clinic, the clinic told her: “We’re
  really concerned that you’re not pregnant yet. You should be pregnant.” The
  RRM specialists suggested that Erica might have endometriosis, which affects
  about one in 10 women and girls worldwide and is believed to be a leading
  cause of infertility. It is also profoundly understudied. In 2023, a mere
  0.06% of the NIH’s $47bn budget was earmarked for endometriosis research.
  Because many doctors dismiss the symptoms of endometriosis or lack the
  expertise to recognize it, it generally takes between five and 11 years to get
  a diagnosis. Erica went ahead with a surgery to diagnose and remove
  endometriosis tissue. RRM practitioners have suggested that the condition can
  be treated by a “one-and-done surgery” – as one RRM surgeon put it in the
  Heritage Foundation report – that aggressively excises endometriosis tissue. A
  month later, Erica got pregnant. Erica estimated that she and her husband
  spent, in total, about $2,500 on RRM. “We definitely wouldn’t have our
  daughter without them,” she said of RRM specialists. Many of RRM’s
  prescriptions are common sense: if you are trying to get pregnant, it can be
  helpful to take a holistic view of your health and know as much about your
  menstrual cycle as possible. But mainstream reproductive endocrinologists are
  skeptical of RRM’s position that infertility itself is not a disease, which
  runs counter to the World Health Organization’s definition of infertility.
  They also suspect that RRM may over-rely on surgery to treat endometriosis.
  One recent review of infertility treatments published in the New England
  Journal of Medicine found that while surgery can help mild cases of
  endometriosis, doctors should use IVF when it is severe. When treated with
  IVF, almost 40% of women under 35 who have endometriosis get pregnant within a
  single cycle, the review found. “We do a lot of surgery and other treatment
  options that can optimize a woman’s fertility. But in the end, there are many
  diagnoses that cannot be solved with those elements alone and need a very
  effective tool like IVF,” said Dr Rachel Weinerman, a reproductive
  endocrinologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University’s
  school of medicine. “You need to have a whole toolbox available to decide what
  is the right tool for that specific patient.” Dr Eve Feinberg, a reproductive
  endocrinologist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg school of medicine,
  first heard of RRM when she started treating patients who had tried it. If
  patients stick with RRM and defer the use of assisted reproductive technology
  for too long, Feinberg warned, some may become so old that they lose their
  chance to have biological children. “I’ve had many sobbing women in my office
  who really missed out on their fertility window by trying endless numbers of
  years of this method, who weren’t given the truth and weren’t given a chance
  to explore other methods because they were misled and they were told that this
  would work for them,” she said. “I counsel my patients that IVF has
  limitations. It doesn’t work for every patient. I didn’t feel like these women
  were adequately counseled in that way.” In an extensive memo it shared with
  the Guardian, IIRRM rejected many of the critiques of RRM as unfounded,
  including the idea that it over-relies on surgery. Physicians who provide IVF
  too often default to it, the institute contended, adding that it would welcome
  more research comparing RRM to conventional medicine. As someone who eats a
  mostly plant-based diet, runs religiously and avoids makeup, Feinberg
  considers herself to be more “natural” than most. She understands the appeal
  of the wellness-style language that surrounds RRM. “It’s being marketed as
  being holistic. It’s being marketed as being natural and ethical,” Feinberg
  said. But, she continued: “I think RRM plays into this fallacy that we can
  understand everything and we can fix everything. And it’s just not true.”
