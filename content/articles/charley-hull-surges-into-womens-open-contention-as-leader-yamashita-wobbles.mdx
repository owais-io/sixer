  There are few things more exciting in golf than a marauding Charley Hull. Not
  only did we witness precisely that here on Saturday, but Hull sent an errant
  shot whizzing past the head of Minjee Lee for added theatrical effect. Hull
  had been battling to make the AIG Women’s Open cut for much of Friday
  afternoon. She started her third round 11 shots adrift of Miyu Yamashita.
  Within nine holes, Hull was five under par and on the charge. Birdies at the
  12th and 13th meant she was four behind Yamashita. Hull did bogey the 14th,
  meaning a 66, but Yamashita’s failure to build on her 36-hole position
  suddenly makes this a highly intriguing scene. She had one player within six
  strokes of her at halfway. A messy 74 means her lead is a single shot. Her
  short putting touch totally deserted her over the closing stretch. Hull is
  three behind. On the penultimate hole, Yamashita outrageously saved par from
  40ft. This was a rare highlight. Thoughts of a procession have quickly
  vanished. Back-to-back nines of 37 saw to that. The prospect of wind and rain
  on day four means this could turn into an epic scrap. Hull was in wonderfully
  bullish mood. “I just enjoy chasing,” she said. “It’s quite fun. I like it.
  It’s more fun that way. I like hunting someone down.” Will she go for it on
  Sunday? What a silly question. “100%. I haven’t got anything to lose, have I?”
  It would, in one sense, be ridiculous if Hull ends her wait for a major on the
  Welsh coast. She has never been a huge fan of links golf and entered this
  tournament nursing a back problem. Hull had also revealed she lost four
  kilograms because of illness after she was removed from the course at the
  Evian Championship on a medical cart. “Kind of like playing golf with your
  mates,” said Hull of her mindset for the final round. “You just want to make
  birdies on every hole. That’s how it feels tomorrow.” Unsurprisingly, she now
  feels as strong as ever. Hull came close to injuring another member of the
  field. A rare loose shot, at the 4th, went flying past Lee after a single
  bounce as she addressed her ball on the 17th tee. The ball rebounded from
  signage at the back of the tee, meaning Hull was spared a shot from deep
  rough. “I like Minjee, I wouldn’t want to take her out,” she said with a
  smile. Lee was unperturbed by the incident. “It was nothing major,” said the
  Australian. “I was glad the ball bounced. I’m pretty focused. I just reset and
  then just go hit the ball.” This is not just the Yamashita and Hull show.
  Yamashita’s wobbling brought a number of players back into the tournament. Kim
  A-lim is the closest to Yamashita’s nine under. Andrea Lee is a shot further
  back at minus seven. Megan Khang, Rio Takeda and Minami Katsu are alongside
  Hull at six under. Georgia Hall will fancy her chances from four under and
  Hall is a shot ahead of Lottie Woad. Twenty-three players are within seven of
  what is now very much an under-pressure leader.
