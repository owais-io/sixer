  Some circus shows start with relatively simple tricks and work up to their big
  finish, saving the impressive stuff for last. Brisbane’s Circa are so
  confident in the breadth of their skills and invention that right off the bat
  they bring out a guy who can hold the weight of six other people all balanced
  in a tower on top of him. It’s quite an opening statement. Edinburgh fringe is
  awash with acrobatics and there are plenty of people trying to do what Circa
  do – stylish circus with choreographic sensibility; athletic and atmospheric –
  but this troupe has been at it for 20 years and director Yaron Lifschitz has
  really got it down. Wolf is a very entertaining hour that embraces animal
  instincts. It’s down with politeness, up with prowling, snarling, shows of
  sheer strength and seriously sexy posturing (complete with red lipstick).
  Designer Libby McDonnell’s sleek costumes in fawn and black stripes make their
  own optical effects, too. There might be a touch of the feral, but this show
  is also super-slick. Bodies fly, hurl, flip, swing, teeter, strain and splat
  (deliberately) flat on the floor. They toss each other across the stage, from
  one human tower to another, and test gravity’s limits in shape-shifting
  balances of three, four, five, six people. The fluid interactions are well
  drilled but still utterly live in the moment. Some highlights: the woman who
  balances two men on her shoulders – take that, gender norms! A funny set piece
  with two men in a tight embrace thwarting other performers’ increasingly
  desperate attempts to infiltrate their hug. And the edgy energy of an aerial
  straps routine where the performer is like a trapped insect, spiky limbs
  attacking or struggling to get free, rather than the usual silken grace you
  get from aerialists. There’s no great message here, bar “Look at how awesome
  these performers are”. They are enjoying every minute, and displaying human
  instincts as much as animal ones. The charged atmosphere plateaus a little way
  before the end – a more expansive soundtrack could have helped with the arc –
  but Circa show they are the masters at what they do. • At Underbelly Circus
  Hub on the Meadows, Edinburgh, until 23 August • All our Edinburgh festival
