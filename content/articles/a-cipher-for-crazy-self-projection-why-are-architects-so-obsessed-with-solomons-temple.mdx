  ‘A cipher for crazy self-projection’: why are architects so obsessed with
  Solomon’s Temple?

  No legendary building has ever inspired more conjecture about what it might
  have looked like than Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem. It is said to have been
  built in c.950BC, on the mound where God created Adam, and was destroyed 400
  years later by marauding Babylonians. But, beyond some inconsistent
  descriptions in the Bible written centuries after the temple was razed, there
  is no archaeological evidence that this palatial edifice ever existed. And
  yet, for more than two millennia, generations of architects, archaeologists
  and ideologues have bickered over the building’s appearance. They have debated
  its exact height and width, speculated on the design of its columns, and
  battled over the precise nature of its porch. The mythic building, also known
  as the First Temple, has inspired everything from a Renaissance royal palace
  in Spain to a recent megachurch in Brazil, to the interiors of masonic lodges
  around the world – all built on a fantasy. “It really draws out the batshit
  crazy,” says Argentinian artist Pablo Bronstein, standing in front of his
  monumental new drawings of what Solomon’s Temple, and its contents, might have
  looked like. “It has been used as a cipher for pretty much every crazy
  projection of power and self-delusion for 2,500 years. I find it totally
  fascinating – particularly as the whole thing is entirely fabricated.”
  Bronstein’s work has long played with the provocative power of architectural
  image-making. He has poked fun at Britain’s pseudo-Georgian housing and given
  us orgiastic depictions of hell, which he imagined as a showcase city strewn
  with garish monuments worthy of the most tasteless dictator. But the subject
  matter, location and (incidental) timing of his latest mischievous outing
  couldn’t be more charged. Bronstein’s speculative drawings of the holiest site
  in Judaism are now on display in Waddesdon Manor, an inflated French chateau
  built in Buckinghamshire in the 1890s as the weekend party pad of the
  Rothschilds – an immensely wealthy Jewish banking family who were instrumental
  in the creation of Israel. Baron Edmond de Rothschild – the French cousin of
  Baron Ferdinand, who built Waddesdon – financed a number of early settlements
  in Palestine and founded the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association in
  1924, run by his son James, who inherited the manor. When the Balfour
  Declaration was written in 1917, declaring the British government’s support
  for a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine, it was addressed to
  Ferdinand’s nephew, Walter Rothschild, an eccentric zoologist who liked to
  pose astride giant tortoises, ride a carriage drawn by zebras andwho was also
  a prominent Zionist leader. A permanent exhibition at Waddesdon, in a room
  preceding Bronstein’s show, celebrates the Rothschilds’ connection with
  Israel. It recounts the family’s funding of the construction of the Knesset
  building, seat of the Israeli parliament, the Supreme Court building and, most
  recently, the National Library, designed by Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de
  Meuron in the shape of a swooping stone ski jump. Architectural models of
  these trophy buildings gleam in Perspex vitrines, like the priceless antique
  treasures displayed elsewhere around the house. To this lavish display of
  patronage in the Holy Land, Bronstein’s florid drawings add an imaginary
  additional commission. In a brazen act of architectural cosplay, the artist
  has inserted himself into the minds of two contestants for a fictitious
  version of the Prix de Rome, a prominent prize for students of architecture in
  19th-century Paris, as they compete to recreate Solomon’s Temple in their own
  image. “I became fascinated by the construction of Jewish identity in the 19th
  century,” says Bronstein, who was born in Argentina, grew up in London, and
  describes himself as a “diehard atheist Jew”. Several years in the making, his
  new work was commissioned alongside a wider research project about Jewish
  country houses, and it seems to have triggered a deep curiosity and scepticism
  in the artist about his own cultural heritage. “As nationalisms develop in the
  19th century, particularly in Germany, Judaism begins to develop its idea of a
  body of people that are somehow genetically connected to the ancient Middle
  East,” he says. “They start to see Jerusalem not as an abstract idea, the way
  that Muslims look at Mecca, but as a reconstructible place of belonging, tied
  to a kind of orientalist architectural fantasy.” Bronstein’s mesmerising
  drawings depict what, if taken to extremes, this fantasy might have looked
  like. Painstakingly drawn in pen and ink, and beautifully coloured with layers
  of acrylic wash (with the help of two recent architecture graduate
  assistants), the images are magnificently grandiose projections of that
  exoticised 19th-century longing. They depict two rival designs, in precisely
  detailed elevations, cross-sections and facade studies, for reconstructing the
  temple. Both are wild mashups of architectural motifs, sampling from the
  richly embellished catalogue of Asian antiquity, medieval and gothic revival,
  baroque and art deco with promiscuous relish. On one wall is a version of the
  temple that Bronstein describes as “vaudeville beaux arts”, its interior
  glowing with the gilded razzle-dazzle of a New Orleans casino. Marvel at the
  spiralling Solomonic columns at the entrance, sampled from Bernini’s
  baldacchino at St Peter’s in Rome, and the illusionistic domes that hover
  above the Ark, influenced by Alessandro Antonelli’s Mole Antonelliana in
  Turin, which was originally conceived as a synagogue. “It’s the temple as a
  sort of gin palace,” says Bronstein – an architecturally virtuosic one,
  nonetheless. On the opposite wall is a more restrained version of the temple,
  with interior wooden panelling that recalls the kind of synagogue you might
  find in Golders Green, north London – not far from where Bronstein grew up in
  Neasden. There are also notes of Henri Labrouste’s Bibliothèque de Saint
  Geneviève in Paris, as well as dazzling blue lapis lazuli walls, representing
  the celestial realm in a medieval manner, along the lines of Eugène
  Viollet-le-Duc, the “arch-reconstructor of historic architecture”, a caption
  tells us. It’s a heady cocktail, made no less so by the fruity facade, which
  depicts the heads of Moses, David and Solomon as blue-bearded gargoyles above
  the entrance, and a relief of God, flanked by sphinxes. “There’s a good amount
  of scholarship about what a temple would have actually looked like if it was
  built in the 10th century BC,” says Bronstein. “And it’s got nothing to do
  with monotheism.” He thinks it’s much more likely that, had the temple been
  built at the time the Bible alleges, it is highly likely that it would have
  been a pantheistic riot, full of different representations of the divine – as
  is the case with a comparable structure that has survived in Ain Dara in
  Syria, built in 1300BC, “which is just full of goblins, basically.” If all
  this wasn’t enough, Bronstein has also drawn the Ark of the Covenant –
  depicted as a gilded medieval reliquary casket, topped with a cushion, where
  God is said to have rested his feet – and the temple’s menorah, imagined as a
  twirly rococo candelabrum, whose branches emerge from a chinoiserie-style
  grotto. Drawings from the Waddesdon archive in a following room help to set
  the project in context, and show that Bronstein’s flamboyant fantasies aren’t
  so far from what was being designed by the 19th-century architects from whom
  he took inspiration. Alarmingly, nor are they too far off what some people are
  still hoping to see built in Jerusalem. The Third Temple movement continues to
  campaign to rebuild the original temple on Temple Mount, one of the most
  contested sites on the planet – known as the Haram al-Sharif in the Muslim
  world, site of the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa mosque, two of the holiest
  sites in Islam. We can only hope the Third Temple fanatics don’t misconstrue
  Bronstein’s drawings as a blueprint. He began these drawings long before war
  erupted in the region after Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023. Has Israel’s
  merciless bombardment of Gaza altered his position? “The work hasn’t changed,”
  he says. “But the war has changed my relationship to Judaism. It made me
  really question the fact that we all get instinctively bullied into the idea
  that we have a genetic, cosmic link to the Holy Land. It’s genuinely a
  19th-century construct and it’s total rubbish.” • Pablo Bronstein: The Temple
