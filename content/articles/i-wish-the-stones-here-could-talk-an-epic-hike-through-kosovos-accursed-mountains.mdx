  There are stone bunkers shrouded in the mist on the hillside to my right, just
  shy of the ridgeline marking the Albanian-Kosovo border. To my left, the view
  is not just clear but startlingly beautiful. I’m able to see back down to the
  tiny mountain hamlet of Gacaferi, where I’d slept the previous night, to look
  across the deep greenery of Deçan Gorge beyond, over dense pine forests and
  grasslands that pop with pink and yellow wildflowers, and gaze all the way to
  the 2,461m summit of Çfërla and the rugged peaks of western Kosovo’s Accursed
  mountains. We are on stage nine of the Via Dinarica Kosovo, a 75-mile,
  13-stage hiking trail through this storied country. The route links up to the
  Via Dinarica, a Balkan trail that runs from Slovenia through to Albania. The
  Kosovo section opened in 2015, but was recently remapped and relaunched as
  part of a three-year, £1.2m project funded by the Italian agency AICS. There
  was a Yugoslav barracks in Gacaferi during the Kosovo war – the brutal
  conflict between the Kosovo Liberation Army (known locally as the UÇK) and
  Slobodan Milošević’s Yugoslavia, which ended with an aerial Nato bombing
  campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. UÇK fighters used to launch surprise
  attacks over the border ridge here, and arms were smuggled into Kosovo for use
  by liberation fighters. The barracks is long gone. Today, the handful of
  locals in Gacaferi fly red Albanian flags outside their houses alongside
  Kosovo blue. They tend to their sheep and warmly welcome hikers, who trade
  travel stories while feasting on burek and Rugova cheese in the scenic
  guesthouse. “I wish the stones here could talk,” says Uta Ibrahimi, my
  mountain guide. Uta is the founder of Butterfly Outdoor Adventure, and was an
  integral part of the Via Dinarica Kosovo project. She also happens to be the
  first person from Kosovo to have climbed Mount Everest, having done so in
  2017. And on 10 May 2025, when she stood on the 8,586-metre summit of
  Kanchenjunga in the Himalayas, Ibrahimi became the first woman from the
  Balkans to have climbed all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre mountains. Uta
  returned to a hero’s welcome at Pristina airport. “I did it for myself, but
  also for my country,” Uta says. “Not just for the Himalayan views.” I had
  arrived in the capital of Pristina some days earlier. I walked past statues of
  Bill Clinton and Bob Dole; past new cathedrals and centuries-old mosques.
  Brilliant, bizarre brutalist architecture draws the gaze here – most notably
  the National Library of Kosovo, formed of a cluster of exposed concrete
  blocks, caged in metal and topped by domes. The Via Dinarica connects the
  municipalities of Peja, Deçan and Junik in western Kosovo. To start our
  adventure – hiking a 40-mile stint of the Via Dinarica – we drove to the city
  of Peja, behind which the Accursed mountains rise like fortress walls. We
  began on stage three, with sunny alpine views and green slopes rising to
  prominent peaks. Red and white waymarkers guided us up narrow trails to the
  2,403-metre Hajla peak, on the border of Kosovo and Montenegro. On one side,
  the ridgeline slopes sharply down to the Balkan pines of Kosovo and across
  green valleys to the mountains of Albania. On the other side, there is a near
  vertical drop down to Montenegro, via rugged, exposed limestone cliff. I ate
  spinach burek for lunch on the summit of Hajla, sitting next to fuzzy,
  star-shaped edelweiss flowers, while alpine choughs circled above. We slept at
  ERA Lodge, a homely wooden mountain cabin run by Fatos Lajçi, a passionate
  conservationist. “Everything that’s in Europe, we have here,” he said; brown
  bears, wild boars, wolves and even the endangered Balkan lynx. This lynx is at
  serious risk of extinction, but has on occasion wandered by Lajçi’s camera
  traps. As we left the next morning, a shepherd sang songs of love and lost
  heroes to his flock, and we rejoined the Via Dinarica on a freshly built
  section of trail. Descending into a meadow, we were engulfed in blueberry
  bushes; our boots brushing against wild strawberries and carrots. It was not
  until a few days later, when we reached Kulla Guesthouse in Milishevc, a
  building styled like an old stone tower, that we met another hiker. Here, we
  gorged on köfte, washed down with rakı, “for digestion”. The border with
  Montenegro soon became the border with Albania. We walked by memorials to
  fallen UÇK soldiers. Hard rain and mist clouded the view, but limestone
  monoliths poked through and wildflowers defied the clouds with sprinkles of
  colour. By the time we arrived in Gacaferi, the sun was shining on the
  tractors and goats of this remote hamlet. In the evenings there was time for
  me to bug Uta for stories. She is full of tales; of crampons received as
  Valentine’s gifts; of poles perilously dropped at 8,000 metres; of loved ones
  lost on mountain faces, or to war; of emotional summit days and ecstatic
  nights dancing at festivals. Ibrahimi was 15 years old when war hit, but she
  speaks with a contagious positivity. “We had to stay inside for three months
  of bombing, and you never knew if it was the last day of your life,” she says.
  “We had to jump walls to run away from the police. That whole idea, of waiting
  for that moment they will come – and who knows what they will do to you – it
  just made us stronger and more willing to live. Then when you are free, you do
  not see any limits.” From Gacaferi, we set our sights on the 2,656-metre
  Gjeravica. It is a hulking peak surrounded by heart-shaped mountain lakes and
  patches of snow. This side of the Accursed mountains is more dramatic than the
  border with Montenegro, the gentle green replaced by fierce grey. Above the
  2,400-metre mark, we hike on limestone slabs bright with lichen. On the
  summit, a Kosovo flag flies above a trig point bearing the double-headed eagle
  of Albania. There is a metal marker with a UÇK head, and a view over Kosovo’s
  flatland. Our descent is remarkably pretty, running along the secluded
  Gjeravica Lake, through fields of blueberry bushes, on to grassland peppered
  with yellow flowers. There is a soft beauty to this country; in the mint you
  smell in the meadows, in the sound of the whinchats on the hills, in the fluff
  of the edelweiss flowers on high ridges, and in the warmth of the guesthouses,
  where the burek is plentiful and the coffee strong. “People want somewhere
  quiet, super-wild, without any roads,” says Uta. “It’s here to explore.” The
  trip was provided by NaturKosovo. A five-day trip on the Via Dinarica Kosovo
  with Butterfly Outdoor Adventure costs €590, or a nine-day adventure from
  €990, including transfers, accommodation and meals. The Via Dinarica Kosovo
  project is being implemented by Volontari nel Mondo RTM and CELIM in
  collaboration with Utalaya Foundation, Club Alpino Italiano, AITR, CNSAS and
  AICS
