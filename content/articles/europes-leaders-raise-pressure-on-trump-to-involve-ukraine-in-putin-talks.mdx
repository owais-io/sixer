  Europe’s leaders have raised the pressure on Donald Trump to involve Ukraine
  in a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, as Germany warned the White House
  against any deal hatched “over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians”.
  Speaking before a bilateral meeting expected to take place between the US and
  Russian leaders on Friday in Alaska, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz,
  said he hoped and assumed that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would
  also be involved. Merz told the broadcaster ARD that Berlin was working
  closely with Washington to try to ensure Zelenskyy’s attendance at the talks.
  “We cannot accept in any case that territorial questions are discussed or even
  decided between Russia and America over the heads of Europeans and
  Ukrainians,” he said. “I assume that the American government sees it the same
  way.” The secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, said the summit would be
  about testing Putin on how serious he was about “bringing this terrible war to
  an end”. In pointed remarks, Rutte added: “It will be, of course, about
  security guarantees, but also about the absolute need to acknowledge that
  Ukraine decides on its own future, that Ukraine has to be a sovereign nation,
  deciding on its own geopolitical future.” Announcing there would be an
  emergency meeting of EU ministers for Monday, Brussel’s top diplomat, Kaja
  Kallas, echoed that sentiment. “President Trump is right that Russia has to
  end its war against Ukraine. The US has the power to force Russia to negotiate
  seriously. Any deal between the US and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU
  included, for it is a matter of Ukraine’s and the whole of Europe’s security,”
  Kallas said. The US vice-president, JD Vance, speaking a day after meeting the
  UK foreign minister, David Lammy, during his holiday in England, said
  Washington was working towards talks between Putin, Zelenskyy and Trump. But
  Vance said he did not think it would be productive for the Russian president
  to meet his Ukrainian counterpart before speaking with Trump. “We’re at a
  point now where we’re trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things
  like that, around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end
  to this conflict,” he told Fox News. As the diplomacy ramped up, there was no
  let-up in hostilities. Five people were killed in Russian shelling and drone
  attacks in Ukraine on Sunday, authorities said, while Russia said one person
  had been killed in a Ukrainian drone strike in its southern Saratov region. On
  Saturday, two people died and 16 others were injured when a Russian drone hit
  a minibus in the suburbs of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, said the region’s
  governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Two others died after a Russian drone struck
  their car in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to the regional governor. On
  Saturday night, European leaders issued a coordinated statement that said the
  “path to peace” in Ukraine could not be decided without Kyiv. Welcoming
  Trump’s attempts to end the war, leaders from the UK, France, Italy, Germany,
  Poland and Finland, along with the president of the European Commission,
  Ursula von der Leyen, emphasised that negotiations could only take place in
  the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities. It added: “Only an
  approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on
  the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed.” On Sunday,
  Zelenskyy welcomed the support, saying on X: “The end of the war must be fair,
  and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for
  the sake of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests
  of our European nations. “Ukraine values and fully supports the statement by
  President Macron, Prime Minister Meloni, Chancellor Merz, Prime Minister Tusk,
  Prime Minister Starmer, President Ursula von der Leyen, and President Stubb on
  peace for Ukraine.” In a Telegram post on Saturday, Zelenskyy had said that
  any decisions made without Kyiv were “dead decisions” and “[would] never
  work”. On the same day, at Chevening, a country mansion in Kent traditionally
  used by the foreign secretary, Lammy hosted Vance along with Ukrainian and
  European partners aimed at driving peace in Ukraine. If the Trump-Putin summit
  goes ahead, it will be the first time a US president has met the Russian
  leader since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last
  meeting Putin had with a US president was with Joe Biden in Geneva in June
  2021. Details of a potential deal have not been announced, but Trump said
  ending the war would involve “some swapping of territories to the betterment
  of both”, meaning Ukraine could be required to renounce significant parts of
  its territory. Zelenskyy on Saturday stressed that Ukrainians would “not give
  up their land to occupiers”. A European official confirmed a counterproposal
  was put forward by European representatives at the Chevening meeting but
  declined to provide details. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal,
  the counterproposal included demands that a ceasefire must take place before
  any other steps were taken and that any territory exchange must be reciprocal,
  with firm security guarantees. It was not clear what, if anything, had been
  agreed at Chevening, but Zelenskyy called the meeting constructive. “All our
  arguments were heard,” he said in his evening address to Ukrainians. “The path
  to peace for Ukraine should be determined together and only together with
  Ukraine. This is [a] key principle.” Merz said he hoped for a breakthrough at
  the summit, despite lingering uncertainty of the attenders. “We hope that
  there will be a breakthrough on Friday,” he said. “Above all [we hope] that
  there will finally be a ceasefire and that there can be peace negotiations in
  Ukraine.”
