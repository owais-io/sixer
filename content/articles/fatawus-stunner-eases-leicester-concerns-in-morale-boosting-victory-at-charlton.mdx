  The concerned noise surrounding Leicester may not have been quieted, but Martí
  Cifuentes’s team, who are seeking a return to the Premier League as soon as
  possible, brushed aside the doubts – and Charlton’s high-intensity press –
  thanks to Abdul Fatawu’s sensational strike. “It was a far from perfect game,”
  said Cifuentes. “Their approach was very aggressive, very physical. They threw
  a lot of bodies in the box. It is not a performance I am extremely pleased or
  happy with. The identity of what we want to see is still not there.” The game
  was not without controversy as a late Lloyd Jones header from a corner was
  ruled out by the referee, Dean Whitestone. “The goal is – I am going to get
  myself in trouble – an absolute travesty,” said Nathan Jones, the Charlton
  manager. “It’s a fairytale. It’s a bit of Hans Christian Andersen. They were
  released from jail by an individual. If someone did their job today we would
  be having a different conversation. “I’ve knocked on [Whitestone’s] door
  twice. I am going to see him. I have to say what the Football League wants me
  to say. I am disappointed. I disagree with certain elements of
  decision-making. If I say what I want to say it’s totally different.” Jones
  also accused Leicester players of going down too easily and avoiding going
  toe-to-toe with his team’s press. The style of play Cifuentes has tried to
  implement is clear, with the visitors favouring the triangle of Hamza
  Choudhury, Boubakary Soumaré and Fatawu to move the ball up the pitch. But
  Charlton were aggressive from the first whistle and Conor Coventry covered a
  lot of ground in midfield to block the passing lanes of Leicester’s
  right-sided trio. As a result, it was the hosts with the early chances.
  Tyreece Campbell and Greg Docherty had shots blocked in the fourth minute
  before Miles Leaburn’s shot on target was deflected into the away end.
  Leicester have yet to bring in a striker to replace Jamie Vardy, who left this
  summer after 13 seasons at the club and 200 goals in all competitions. Instead
  they have begun the season with Jordan Ayew as their starting No 9. But if
  there was a game to rethink their activity in the market it would have been
  this one. Ayew certainly has experience, but the 33-year-old’s best days are
  clearly behind him. He was isolated and struggled against Jones. When he did
  drop deep, he often failed to evade the tackle or win the foot race. The hosts
  won an back-to-back corners to start the second half. Jones’s header deflected
  away from the first before Amari’i Bell’s was saved off the line. They were
  moments Charlton would come to regret as seconds later the ball was in the
  back of the net at the other end. For all of the hosts’ resilient defending,
  there was little they could do as Fatawu skipped forward, cut inside from the
  right and curled an outrageous finish into the far top corner to give the
  visitors the lead. Charlton thought they had an equaliser in the 82nd minute
  from their 12th corner after Jones’s header slipped past Jakub Stolarczyk, but
  Whitestone blew his whistle before the ball went in for a push in the area.
  “5-1 would have been a fair result,” said Jones. “We created enough chances to
  win a League Two, League One, Championship and Premier League game. We created
  enough chances to win three games.”
