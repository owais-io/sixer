  Thinking about how we publicly celebrate or memorialise women’s achievements
  has changed – but not in pace with contemporary art practice. The highly
  figurative bronze statue is such a relic of a colonial patriarchy, and yet it
  is still often the go-to kind of representation in the public square.
  Replacing figurative statues of colonists and enslavers with more figurative
  statues is timid, and so reductive. We can do so much better than erecting
  supersized dolls on plinths outside post offices and shopping malls. New work
  such as Khaleb Brooks’s shell sculpture The Wake, mentioned in your editorial
  (The Guardian view on statues: new monuments reflect changing values and
  reinvigorate the public realm, 1 August), don’t just commemorate a past, they
  declare a now agreed truth that was once obscured by the powerful. Here in
  Australia, public art is an especially potent working surface for First
  Nations Australian women. Let’s embrace the symbolic change that comes with
  replacing redundant or harmful public commemorations with new (or not so new)
  art approaches – not just objects, but digital, environmental or sound
  sculptures. Public art can elevate and enchant, and be a wonderful placemaking
  device. And contemporary art forms can provoke, inspire wonder and keep this
  dialogue alive. Dr Wendy Osmond Sydney, Australia • We are very grateful for
  your editorial about statues, highlighting our campaign for a statue in
  Brighton for Mary Clarke, the first suffragette to die, on Christmas Day 1910,
  for women’s right to vote. You say that Clarke died “after being force-fed in
  prison”. While there is little doubt that her hunger strike and the brutality
  of prison conditions will have hastened her death by brain haemorrhage, it
  seems clear – and leading suffragettes at the time believed – that the initial
  damage was done before she was imprisoned, at the notorious “Black Friday”
  events of 18 November 1910. On that occasion, 300 suffragettes attempting to
  lobby parliament were savagely beaten and in many cases sexually assaulted by
  east London police. Three women died as a result, of whom Mary Clarke was the
  first. Henria Williams died a week later on 1 January 1911, while Cecilia Haig
  died on 31 December 1911, of injuries sustained that day. Jean Calder Chair of
  trustees, Mary Clarke Statue Appeal • Regarding statues of women, I am pleased
  to say that a woman who was a political activist and a community leader but
  who was, unfortunately, all but forgotten has been honoured in Glasgow. A
  memorial to Mary Barbour, created by Andrew Brown and depicting her leading
  her fellow rent strikers in 1915, stands at Govan Cross. Mary was an ordinary
  working-class woman, but the importance of her campaign, which helped lead to
  the Rent Restriction Act, deserves to be memorialised in bronze. Perhaps a wee
  girl looking at it today might just think: “Maybe I can do what Mary did.”
  Mary Fitzpatrick Glasgow • Yes all statues have meaning and, yes, too many are
  of rich, powerful, white men whose legacy is often tainted. But please let me
  draw your attention to the Grade II-listed artwork Platforms Piece at Brixton
  railway station. It was created by the artist Kevin Atherton and installed in
  1986 (enhanced in 2023). This work comprises four lifesize images representing
  the diverse community that Brixton station serves: three of these figures are
  of local black residents standing as if waiting for a train. The other is of a
  young local white woman who moved to Brixton from Germany. So, yes, the nurse
  Mary Seacole fully deserved to be honoured by her 2016 statue – but let’s also
  recognise the importance of this much earlier work in celebrating the
  contribution made by people such as these far-from-ordinary Brixton folk to
  the richness and diversity of our society. Peter Corkill Elham, Kent • The
  letter above from Jean Calder was amended on 12 August 2025. An earlier
  version gave the date of Cecilia Haig’s death as “31 November 1911”.
