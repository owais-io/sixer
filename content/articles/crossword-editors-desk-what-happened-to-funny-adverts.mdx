  Whatever happened to humour? Claw’s Genius puzzle for August had plenty and
  its solution is below. The instructions … Careful consideration of the
  superfluous material – along with the limits revealed by the conundrum – will
  lead to only one conclusion, which should be written below the grid. … now
  make twice as much sense. The extra letters (superfluous material) give LOOKS
  LIKE WE’VE OVERDONE IT WITH THE and the perimeter cells (limits) offer
  CASTLEMAINE XXXX ADVERTISEMENT. This is the ad … … in which the superfluous
  material (two bottles of sweet sherry “for the ladies”) finally prompts a
  truck already overloaded with lager to collapse. The cobbers conclude: “Looks
  like we’ve overdone it with the sherry.” Whatever happened to funny adverts? A
  decent dictionary of quotations carries columnfuls of witty lines from decades
  past. Now, commercials are try-hard meme-ish, affirming or cringingly sassy;
  not funny. Compare this with crosswords which are, among other qualities,
  funnier than ever. In crosswords, amazing minds are allowed to pursue original
  thoughts. If crossword creation followed the models of advertising and TV
  production, newspapers would contract more editors, senior executives and
  legal/compliance teams than they would setters. Each clue would pass under
  myriad noses, alternatives suggested and inserted until the last shred of
  personality was excised from each puzzle. Rejoice that it’s not otherwise. On
  the subject of Genius crosswords (a new one arrived today), Michael Stipe has
  himself rejoiced on Bluesky: “So honored to be in the nytimes crossword 102
  across.” Michael, you can feel more honoured still: in May 2021, you were in
  Picaroon’s Genius as part of a clue … 20ac Michael Stipe was like certain
  legal actions (2,3) [ double definition ] … for IN REM. (Also on Bluesky, I
  see that there is to be a new cryptic magazine titled Unch, though after a
  Zoom, two Teamses and somehow a Skype, our legal teams advise me to stress
  that there is no affiliation with this publication and that I am not
  responsible for any material published therein anywhere in the universe in
  perpetuity.) Thanks for your clues for REDACTED. Jacob_Busby takes the
  audacity award for an unexpected Printer’s Devilry in “Slavery: Honour’d
  Athens topped it”. The runners-up are AmusingJay’s striking “Communist decree
  editor ████████ ” and Wellywearer2’s economical “Scratched record”; the winner
  is the also-funny “McCarthy’s accusation covered up”. Kludos to Falconbridge;
  please leave entries for STIPE below, along with any favourite clues or
  puzzles you have spotted. • 188 Words for Rain by Alan Connor is published by
  Ebury (£16.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy at
