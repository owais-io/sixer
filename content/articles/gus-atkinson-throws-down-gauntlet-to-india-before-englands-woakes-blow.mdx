  Welcome to England, India. Or at least, welcome to the England their batters
  might have expected when touching down at the start of June. Cloud cover,
  stoppages for rain, and seamers operating on a green-tinged surface — the
  opening day at the Oval was certainly a far cry from what came before. And yet
  by the time stumps came at 7.30pm the tourists had scrapped their way to a
  serviceable 204 for six from 64 overs and it was England who were feeling a
  bit glum. Though the hosts went into this series decider 2-1 up, a late injury
  to Chris Woakes took the shine off a day that, until that point, had been all
  about Gus Atkinson’s stellar return on his home ground. Figures of two for 31
  from 19 overs did not tell the full story of Atkinson’s day either. Arguably
  the most important strike witnessed came not from his brand of waspish
  fast-medium but a sparkling run out of Shubman Gill for 21 in a six-over
  mini-session between the afternoon showers. Given the glowing form India’s
  captain has been in this series, it felt like a defining moment. It was a
  hugely self-inflicted dismissal too, Gill having dropped Atkinson into the off
  side with a defensive prod and set off for a single that was simply never on.
  Turning on his heels but already in trouble, he could only look on as Atkinson
  swooped in, took aim, and threw down the stumps with unerring precision. The
  look of anguish on Gill’s face as he walked off was palpable. But Gill’s
  despair was later trumped by that of Woakes and what may also be greater by
  way of significance. The only English seamer to push through all five Tests,
  Woakes had chased a ball to the rope only to fall awkwardly in the process. A
  dislocated left shoulder appears the likely upshot here, the 36-year-old
  walking off in agony with his arm in a makeshift sling. Standing in for the
  injured captain Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope now faces the prospect of juggling
  three seamers for the remainder of the match, and only the part time spin of
  Jacob Bethell and Joe Root offering scope for a breather. And though Atkinson
  impressed, pinning Yashasvi Jaiswal lbw for two and getting Dhruv Jurel caught
  in the cordon for 19, Pope will need Josh Tongue and Jamie Overton to offer
  more than they did on day one. Because as much as England were happy to claim
  six wickets, there is a case to say that it should have been more. Lee Fortis,
  chief groundsman and scourge of the tourists in the build-up, had left 8mm of
  grass on the Oval pitch – ideal conditions to lock in on a length and let the
  Dukes do its thing. And yet this was something the support cast struggled to
  achieve at times. In the case of the fast but often wayward Tongue, perhaps
  this is missing the point. England like the point of difference he offers and,
  while he sprayed wides for fun in the morning, his best remains very good
  indeed. His two wickets on the day, Sai Sudharsan for 38 and Ravindra Jadeja
  for nine, were both a case of rip-snorting deliveries being edged behind.
  Overton, however, looks a curious selection on a surface that might be better
  suited to Matthew Potts or Sam Cook. While his speeds picked up from some
  initial 80mph long hops, and swing was harnessed, figures of nought for 66
  were the weak link in the attack – a link that must be strengthened swiftly if
  Woakes spends the remainder of the match on the sidelines. Atkinson, back from
  a hamstring injury, appears to have picked up where he left off at least. His
  removal of Jaiswal was also a notable feat for his Surrey teammate, Pope, who
  sent a decision upstairs for the 14th time as a stand-in captain and finally
  saw one go his way. Going by the celebrations – Pope beaming, wry smiles in
  the dressing room – everyone was fully aware. Although the removal of KL Rahul
  for 14 an hour into play arguably had greater value, such has been the
  right-hander’s proficiency against the moving ball in England. Replacing
  Atkinson from the Pavilion End after a tight six-over opening spell, Woakes
  persuaded Rahul to chop on to his stumps with a bit of nip – even if it was
  always too tight to cut. In the end, with Gill having lost his fifth toss in a
  row, India were grateful to another experienced campaigner for steering them
  out of choppy waters. Recalled after his omission at Old Trafford, Karun Nair
  turned things around from 153 for six at the fall of Jurel’s wicket with a
  classy unbeaten 52 from 98 balls. Support here came from Washington Sundar,
  who made 19 not out. England know all about Sundar, of course, but open up an
  end first thing and India’s tail will begin. Problem is, even with the
  forecast in London set to improve and batting conditions with it, taking 10
  wickets second time around will be a significant challenge if the fears about
  poor Woakes are accurate.
