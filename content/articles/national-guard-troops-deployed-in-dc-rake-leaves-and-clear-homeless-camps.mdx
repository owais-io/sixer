  National guard troops have spent their last days of the summer mulching cherry
  trees, collecting trash and clearing homeless camps across Washington DC, as
  Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the capital evolved the guard from
  makeshift cops to armed jacks of all trades. More than 2,200 soldiers from
  states including Mississippi and Louisiana have been stationed across the city
  since Trump declared a “crime emergency” on 11 August. However, their
  responsibilities now encompass clearing out Union Station and what officials
  term “beautification” projects, including trash collection, mulching around
  cherry trees at the Tidal Basin, and potential graffiti removal. The crime
  crackdown has now reportedly netted 1178 arrests and 123 seized firearms,
  according to a Wednesday morning update from attorney general Pam Bondi.
  Troops reportedly helped with 84 arrests and confiscated eight firearms
  Tuesday alone, she added. A White House official tells the Guardian there were
  2,500 national guard and federal law enforcement in the Tuesday night
  operations, and of the 84 arrests, 40 were undocumented people with arrest
  records. An estimated 49 homeless encampments have also been broken up since 7
  August, the official said. But it goes much further than just policing. The US
  department of transportation has assumed management of Union Station,
  Washington’s main railway terminal, from Amtrak, citing safety concerns and
  infrastructure needs. Armed guard troops now patrol the transit hub while
  armed guard troops patrol its concourses, a bleak difference over what was
  once managed by the national passenger rail service. Amtrak retains control
  only of passenger areas, while a redevelopment corporation handles retail
  operations. And this week, guard members were authorized to carry M4 rifles
  and M17 pistols under Title 32 authority, though the crews tasked with clean
  up remain unarmed. All service members can detain suspects but cannot arrest
  them: that’s left to the police. But the sight of soldiers doing tasks like
  landscaping has sparked questions about military priorities. Defense secretary
  Pete Hegseth, a former national guard officer himself, has repeatedly demanded
  the Pentagon focus on “lethality, lethality, lethality” and strip away
  everything that “distracts” from preparing troops to “fight and win wars”. Yet
  those same troops are now spending time mulching flower beds and raking
  leaves. “I think it’s nice, as a DC resident,” one Guard member told the
  Washington Post while raking. “But there are different things we could be
  doing”. It’s this far reach that’s troubling leaders of other major cities,
  considering the Trump administration’s indication it may expand similar
  domestic deployments to places like Chicago, and the wider militarization of
  civilian law enforcement. Shrai Popat contributed reporting
