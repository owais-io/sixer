  Australia women’s No 1 Daria Kasatkina has overcome a shaky start to ease into
  the second round while late bloomers Priscilla Hon and Adam Walton are
  savouring breakout wins on day two at the US Open. Kasatkina took time to get
  going before outclassing Romanian Elena-Gabriela Ruse 7-5 6-1 to set up a
  second-round meeting with former Russian compatriot Kamilla Rakhimova. The
  15th seed dropped her first two service games of the first set and was broken
  once more by Ruse before holding on for a one-set lead. But Kasatkina, who
  changed allegiances from Russia to Australia in March, found her feet in the
  second set to defeat Ruse in an hour and 18 minutes on Monday (Tuesday AEST).
  “I have to be honest, I could do better,” Kasatkina said. “We’re tennis
  players but we also have stuff going on outside the tennis court. There’s
  always something going on in your life. “Most of the time if you bring it on
  court then you have to fight those things in your head. I’ve had a lot of
  changes in the past year, which was not easy to manage. I hope it’s going to
  be a bit calmer.” Six years after debuting at Flushing Meadows and on her
  third attempt, Hon finally broke through with a 6-3 7-5 victory over
  Frenchwoman Leolia Jeanjean. The 27-year-old qualifier was left overjoyed.
  “It’s my favourite slam apart from the Australian Open so, yeah, can’t be much
  happier right now,” Hon said. “I love New York, everything about it. “Like the
  fans, everyone that comes to watch, there’s so much energy and it’s so chaotic
  and there’s so much happening. Hon will hit a new career-high after the
  tournament but isn’t done yet, vowing to go out swinging against Russian 17th
  seed Liudmila Samsonova. Fellow Brisbane battler Walton also sent a
  more-fancied French opponent packing, taking down 22nd seed Ugo Humbert 6-4
  7-6 (7-4) 5-7 6-1 for the biggest win of his career. Walton’s victory follows
  a titanic win over former world No 1 and 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev
  in Cincinnati and will send the 26-year-old to a career-high of at least No 74
  in the world. “I’ve had a great American summer,” Walton said. “I feel more
  comfortable being back on the hard courts, and I’m just glad that this
  American summer I’ve really been able to capitalise on some good matches and
  some good wins. “Last year was was horrible. I didn’t win a match. But I’m
  just feeling very happy with where my game’s at right now.” Hon and Walton can
  look forward to the biggest pay days yet, a minimum $US154,000 ($A237,000).
  Walton has a huge opportunity to go even deeper in the draw when he faces Hong
  Kong qualifier Coleman Wong, the world No 176, for a place in the last 32 at a
  slam for the first time. The Australia trio join Jordan Thompson in the second
  round but Aleksandar Vukic, James Duckworth and wildcard Talia Gibson all
  bowed out. Vukic lost a three-and-three-quarter-hour thriller 6-3 6-7 (4-7)
  6-4 3-6 6-4 to American Jenson Brooksby, Duckworth succumbed 7-5 6-3 6-4 to US
  wildcard Tristan Boyer and Gibson fell 6-2 6-2 against Polish 28th seed
  Magdalena Frech. Big guns Alex de Minaur, the men’s eighth seed, and Alexei
  Popyrin open their campaigns on Wednesday (AEST).
