  The one change that worked: I abandoned my cynicism – and joined Europe’s
  biggest gay choir

  It is April 2022 and I am standing in the middle of the stage at Cadogan Hall
  in London. As the pianist plays a plucky staccato intro, it dawns on me that I
  am about to sing the West Side Story classic I Feel Pretty, with choreography,
  in front of a packed audience, alongside 200 gay men. This was my first time
  performing with the London Gay Men’s Chorus (LGMC) – Europe’s largest gay
  choir. I first saw them perform years earlier in Soho, where they sang Bridge
  Over Troubled Water at a vigil for the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida in
  2016. After making it through the pandemic, the chorus’s years-long waiting
  list and months of rehearsals, I was under the bright stage lights, trying to
  remember the first line of the song and thinking: “what have I got myself
  into?” In some ways, the LGMC came into my life at the perfect time. I had
  recently gone freelance and I missed the upsides of having colleagues: gossip,
  after-work drinks and trivial office grudges. Looking back to my first
  rehearsal, when I had to wear a name tag to identify myself, I couldn’t have
  predicted how many friends I would make, often with people I wouldn’t have
  encountered in my social circle. One of my choir besties, Bradley, was raised
  as a Mormon in Utah. Our upbringings were different, but being two gay guys
  who love to sing the high notes transcends cultural barriers. On the gossip
  front, there were petty rivalries and microscandals worthy of a Ryan Murphy TV
  drama – it’s a gay choir, after all. When I joined the choir, my biggest fear
  wasn’t the singing, but putting myself out there. After spending most of the
  pandemic staring at a screen, I had become jaded by the cynicism that
  underpins so many online interactions, where being seen to care about anything
  is “cringe”. But it turns out that once you have performed a fully
  choreographed version of Spice Up Your Life – assembled on the stage in a Geri
  Halliwell-inspired union jack formation – that fear rapidly disappears. Once I
  abandoned my cringe complex, it suddenly became much more fun to live out my
  Glee Club fantasy. Over the past four years, I’ve performed at venues
  including the Royal Albert Hall and Alexandra Palace. I marched in the 2022
  parade marking 50 years of London Pride. I have travelled to Italy to sing in
  a Pitch Perfect-style convention with hundreds of queer choirs from across the
  world. (Yes, this is a real thing.) I have been part of a 200-person rainbow
  Pride flag on the stage. These moments have not only helped me to feel less
  self-conscious, but they have also taught me that the things that bring us joy
  are never frivolous – even camp show tunes and sparkles. Last April, the LGMC
  gathered in Soho – just a few streets away from where I first heard them
  perform. We sang Erasure’s queer anthem A Little Respect, to mark the 25th
  anniversary of the Admiral Duncan pub bombing. It was a testament to the power
  of being seen – and heard – for who you really are. As a small part of
  something much bigger, that is how joining a gay choir has made me feel. And I
  am reminded of that every time I step on to the stage, wearing a ridiculous
  glittery costume and once again thinking: “what have I got myself into?”
