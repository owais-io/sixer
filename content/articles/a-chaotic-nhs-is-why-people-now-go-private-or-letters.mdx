  Frances Ryan’s article rings familiar bells (Young people want to ‘go private’
  – I’m a lifelong supporter of the NHS, but I can see why, 20 August). I have
  been waiting 60 weeks for a partial knee replacement. The hospital website and
  the NHS website say “average patient waiting time 18 weeks”. However, at every
  stage my wait has been beset by avoidable delays: two cancelled appointments
  rescheduled months later, three months’ delay reviewing the MRI scan, referral
  from one consultant to another – a “new referral” – and a 12-week wait. After
  my first pre-op, failure to follow up on outstanding investigations
  necessitated a second pre-op, after which the clearance for surgery was not
  communicated to admissions until I pursued it, four weeks later. The current
  message is that they “will try to give me a date within eight weeks”. A
  complaint to the Patient Relations Service elicited the explanation: “That’s
  just the way we do things.” Meanwhile, formal complaints elicit long-delayed
  responses full of nonsensical obfuscation. If the Department of Health and
  Social Care is relying on waiting-list information from hospital trusts like
  this, then plans for NHS reform are doomed to fail. I could have had my
  surgery privately at the same NHS hospital, with the same consultant, within
  weeks of referral. If I’d gone private 14 months ago, I’d probably have been
  able to enjoy 2025 – mobile, and drug and pain-free. Perhaps I’ll go private
  next time? Ed Mason Kendal, Cumbria • Unlike Frances Ryan, I am fortunate to
  have never faced the dilemma of needing to use private healthcare because of
  the apparent failings of the NHS. But despite her personal circumstances I
  think she might reflect on the fact that individual patients buying care does
  have a wider impact upon other patients who may have greater clinical needs.
  The private physiotherapist she used may have been wholly independent, but the
  overwhelming majority of clinicians working in private healthcare also work
  part-time in the NHS. The fact that they are moonlighting, treating those
  choosing to pay, directly contributes to what Ryan describes as the NHS’s
  “sky‑high” waiting lists. In what is now very much a our “me first” society,
  it is swimming against the tide to refer to the common good. But accessing
  private healthcare is anything but a neutral act. It significantly worsens the
  prospects of those who are unable, or unwilling, to take this step, whose
  health problems are often considerably worse than those of the queue-jumpers.
