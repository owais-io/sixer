  Researchers have called for better support for middle-aged and older autistic
  people after a review found that 90% of autistic people aged over 50 in
  Britain are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Greater awareness of autism
  and improved assessments globally mean it is typically spotted in childhood
  today. But in past decades autistic people were often forced to navigate
  middle and old age without the support a diagnosis can unlock. The review into
  ageing across the autism spectrum found that people in the UK faced widespread
  difficulties with employment, relationships and milestone events such as
  menopause and retirement. They consistently suffered from poorer mental and
  physical health. “Autistic children grow into autistic adults and we know that
  they are more likely to have higher rates of most physical and mental health
  problems,” said Dr Gavin Stewart, co-lead of the Re:Spect Lab at King’s
  College London and lead author of the review. “People often need a diagnosis,
  or need to recognise it within themselves, to be able to ask for appropriate
  help and support.” As part of the review, Stewart and Prof Francesca Happé,
  also at King’s, re-analysed UK healthcare records from 2018. By comparing
  rates of autism in middle-aged and older people with the 1% national
  prevalence recognised today, they estimate that in the UK 89% of autistic
  people aged 40 to 59, and 97% of those aged 60 and over, are undiagnosed.
  While global autism rates have risen in recent decades – in 2022, one in every
  31 Americans under the age of eight were found to have the condition – the
  trend is largely attributed to a broadening of the definition and improvements
  in diagnoses, rather than a genuine increase in the percentage of people
  affected. The researchers went on to examine how autistic and non-autistic
  people fared throughout life. The former had higher rates of a multitude of
  conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to cardiovascular disease and
  neurological disorders, they found. Among the most troubling findings were
  higher rates of suicidal thoughts and self-harm in older autistic people, and
  a greater risk of early onset dementia. Average life expectancy differed by
  six years, with autistic people living to 75 years old, compared with 81 years
  old for non-autistic people, but these figures could be skewed by the poor
  diagnosis rates. Details are published in the Annual Review of Developmental
  Psychology. “We need to understand how ageing impacts autistic people to
  better understand what sort of tailored help and support they would actually
  benefit from,” Stewart said. “These are all things that the [autism] community
  needs to be consulted on.” Autism varies from person to person, but doctors
  look for core characteristics when assessing people. These include differences
  in social communication and rigid and repetitive behaviours. The differences
  in communication can lead people to become socially isolated. This, alongside
  the stigmatisation that many autistic people face, can raise the risk of
  mental and physical health problems. It can also make it harder for autistic
  people to find people to approach for help and support. According to the
  review, older autistic people were more likely to face challenges in coping
  with major life events such as arranging residential care. “If you are going
  from working nine to five all of your working life to suddenly not, that could
  have a real impact on you,” Stewart said. “And if you’re going into a care
  home where you’re suddenly forced into situations that you wouldn’t typically
  experience in your own home, that has a big impact.” He added: “If an autistic
  person is having more difficulties throughout their life, when they reach
  these points they can be real breaking points. That’s where support would be
  really beneficial.” Tim Nicholls, at the National Autistic Society, said:
  “This research clearly shows what we already know and hear about every day –
  there are high numbers of undiagnosed autistic adults and going through life
  without a diagnosis has a major impact on many aspects of their lives. “Autism
  assessments can be the first step to understanding people’s needs and a
  diagnosis can be life changing and, in some cases, lifesaving. Autistic people
  and their families face a constant fight for support and far too often this
  starts with long waits for a diagnosis. “The government must provide urgent
  funding for diagnosis services and make sure autistic people and families get
  the support they need when they need it.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans
