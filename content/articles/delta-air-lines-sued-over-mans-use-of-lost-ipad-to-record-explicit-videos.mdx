  A Delta Air Lines employee stole a computer tablet left behind on a plane by a
  South Carolina child, then used it to record sexually explicit videos of
  himself – which saved to cloud storage and were discovered by the minor’s
  parents, a recent federal lawsuit alleges. The child’s parents, Tory and
  Brooke Brewer, sued Delta in US district court in Charleston on 16 July,
  saying their family is owed damages for negligence, intentional infliction of
  emotional distress and harassment, among other causes. “What should have been
  a fun family getaway was riddled with confusion and anxiety over unauthorized
  access to their personal devices, a breach of privacy, and the transmission of
  highly inappropriate, explicit video recordings sent through their child’s
  personal devices, something they never would have expected,” said a statement
  from the Brewers’ attorney, Tola Familoni of Motley Rice law firm. Familoni
  added that his clients are aiming to “hold Delta accountable” for a lack of
  meaningful response to their complaints over the situation prior to the
  lawsuit and hope to “stop anything like this happening to any other families”
  who travel with US airlines. A statement from the airline said “the accused
  individual is not a Delta employee but one of a vendor company” that it did
  not identify. Delta said in its statement that the airline has “zero tolerance
  for unlawful behavior of any kind but will decline to comment further on this
  pending litigation”. According to the Brewers’ lawsuit, on 19 July 2023, the
  couple and their children traveled on a Delta flight from Charleston to New
  York City’s John F Kennedy international airport. They took a connecting
  flight from there to London, where they realized one of the children had
  forgotten an Apple iPad stored in a case featuring the children’s cartoon
  character Peppa Pig because Brooke Brewer began receiving random text messages
  about the tablet. Brooke Brewer used Apple’s Find My app to track the iPad’s
  location and determined it was in New York City. The person with the iPad had
  logged out of Brooke Brewer’s account but was taking photos that were still
  being uploaded to her Apple iCloud account. At first, the photos were
  relatively unremarkable: selfies of a man in his Delta uniform with his name
  badge visible. The Brewers filed a lost and found report with Delta by 20 July
  2023, they recounted in their lawsuit. But a little more than a month later,
  pornographic videos of the same man from the prior images showed up in Brooke
  Brewer’s iCloud account. They depicted him masturbating in his Delta uniform
  while wearing his name badge, the Brewers’ lawsuit said. A second lewd video
  of the man in his Delta uniform – again wearing his name badge – appeared in
  Brooke Brewer’s iCloud account within days, the lawsuit continued. The Brewers
  also learned that the man had managed to access Brooke’s iTunes account and
  create his own personal profile. Furthermore, the man – who is not named in
  the lawsuit – had used the iPad to hack into the Brewers’ Amazon account and
  created a profile titled “Gay” that one of the couple’s children detected and
  alerted them about, the couple alleged. The Brewers said they filed a second
  report with Delta. The major airline – who did not acknowledge the first of
  the reports – responded with a generalized, “no reply” email saying it was
  searching for the iPad, the lawsuit asserted. “We would have hoped, if not
  publicly, at least personally they would have acknowledged their role and
  responsibility for what happened to this family,” Familoni said, referring to
  Delta, in an interview Tuesday. Familoni said the Brewers ultimately filed
  their lawsuit because Delta “unfortunately didn’t do that”. “We hope that
  Delta will step up and take responsibility, speak to the family, and
  acknowledge their wrongdoing,” Familoni said.
