  On a cold morning at the start of February, 15-year-old Harvey Willgoose got
  himself out of bed and dressed for school. He had not been for a while, but
  had built himself up to it. “He went: ‘I’m going to school, Mum, are you proud
  of me?’,” says Caroline Willgoose, nursing a cup of tea at her cousin’s
  kitchen table. “I said: ‘I am love.’ I followed him down. And he said: ‘I love
  you mum. Shut door behind me.’” Hours later, Harvey was stabbed at All Saints
  Catholic high school in Sheffield. He was rushed to hospital, but by the time
  his family arrived, he was already dead. On Friday, a 15-year-old boy, who
  cannot be named for legal reasons and who had pleaded guilty to Harvey’s
  manslaughter, was found guilty of his murder. A judge will decide his sentence
  at a later date. “He’s killed Harvey, but he’s killed us too,” says Harvey’s
  dad, Mark Willgoose. “It’s not just one life.” Caroline says she feels no hate
  for her son’s killer or for his parents. In an early hearing, she looked at
  him in court. “He just looked like a kid,” she says. “And his parents have got
  an empty bedroom too, haven’t they. He’s ruined his life.” Months after
  Harvey’s death, the grief of his parents and his doting nanan, Maria Turner,
  is still palpable and raw. But they want to talk about him: what a special boy
  he was, how loved he was; about young people’s pain and the devastation of
  knife crime. But they also want to talk about Harvey’s struggles with school
  and how they have been left carrying an unfathomable burden of guilt for
  forcing him to go. Harvey was someone “who made you feel good”, says his
  grandmother. Despite being only 15, he was a Sheffield character, well known
  among Sheffield United fans, who he followed home and away. He was a joker,
  who would – rightly, it appears – claim he was a local legend. “He wanted to
  cram everything in,” says Caroline. “And I’m glad. I’m glad he did.” After
  Harvey was killed, a wave of grief enveloped the city. Hundreds marched in his
  memory, while Blades fans could be heard chanting his name from the stands of
  Bramall Lane. Fans of rival club Sheffield Wednesday did the same as they
  travelled to an away match. His funeral at Sheffield Cathedral was packed to
  the rafters. “There were all these kids in suits, chanting ‘Goose’s army,
  Goose’s army’,” says Caroline. “I’ll never forget it, this wave of hundreds
  and hundreds of kids in suits, shouting his name.” In the weeks and months
  after his death, the Willgoose family have been busy making sure Harvey’s name
  will not be forgotten. They are setting up Harvey’s Hub, a dedicated youth
  night at Beighton welfare club where Caroline works with the youth charity
  Always An Alternative (AAA). A poster campaign giving children a place to
  anonymously flag danger through a QR code is in the offing. Caroline wants to
  visit schools to talk about her family’s story and ask them to consider
  installing knife arches – whatever it takes to keep children safe. “We need
  more education about knife crime,” she says. “More talking about the
  devastation that it brings.” The family has also met the home secretary,
  Yvette Cooper, and urged her to do more for struggling teenagers: whether by
  providing spaces for them to socialise, safety from knives or – for teenagers
  like Harvey – other choices for when school is making them miserable and ill.
  It is a problem that has clearly caused them so much pain. Harvey was one of
  about 1.49 million children – approximately one in five pupils – who were
  persistently absent from school in 2023-24. He wanted to be a bricklayer, he
  he had been trying to get a job – and had been offered one – but he was too
  young. “The only time we argued was about school. It was just a constant
  battleground,” says Caroline. “We were all so miserable.” He told his parents
  and his grandmother that it wasn’t that he didn’t want to go; he couldn’t.
  They describe a child clearly struggling with unhappiness. Blocking out the
  voices of people sent to try to get him to attend school, trying to force
  himself to go by staying up all night. He was given a leaflet about mental
  health, they say. He was not on a waiting list for mental health support. The
  couple were threatened with prosecution and fines if they did not get him to
  All Saints – Harvey was asked if that was what he wanted. They said they had
  asked for alternative provision, but were told it would not work. “We engaged
  with the people who we were told to engage with, we were guided by them and we
  did everything they asked,” says Mark. Everyone they were in touch with made
  them feel as if they were the only ones, says his grandmother. “I really can’t
  believe that we took it all,” she says. “We feel so guilty.” Since Harvey’s
  death, Caroline posted on social media, asking if other parents were suffering
  too. Hundreds of parents got in touch to say they were going through the same
  thing. The family want the government to explore more pragmatic, alternate
  provisions for children like Harvey. “School, as it is, is not for everybody,”
  says Caroline. “There should be something else in place for the kids that
  can’t go.” Forcing children, threatening them and their parents simply won’t
  work, says her husband. “You’ve got to get to the bottom of why.” Mark says he
  wants Harvey to be remembered as someone who “had a short life, but a good
  life”. Caroline thinks his legacy is already being put in place. “I think
  Harvey was put here for a reason, to change things,” she says. “He was put
  here for a reason, because he was special.”
