  Newcastle United have agreed a £55m deal to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford.
  Brentford have remained bullish throughout the summer in their stance that
  they wanted close to their £60m asking price for Wissa, despite the striker
  entering the final 12 months of his contract, and on Monday morning accepted a
  deal. The agreement comes 24 hours after the 28-year-old issued a statement on
  social media accusing Brentford of “unduly standing in his way” of a move to
  St James’ Park. Brentford rejected previous offers from Newcastle worth about
  £40m. Wissa’s exit would be the second major sale at Brentford this window,
  with Bryan Mbeumo joining Manchester United for an initial £65m. Last summer
  Brentford sold Ivan Toney to Al-Ahli in a £40m deal. Brentford have seen
  several high-profile departures this summer, with Thomas Frank leaving to
  become Tottenham manager and the former club captain Christian Nørgaard
  signing for Arsenal. Brentford broke their transfer record to land Dango
  Ouattara from Bournemouth in a £42.5m deal. Wissa has scored 49 goals in 149
  appearances, including 19 in the Premier League last season, since joining
  Brentford in a £8.5m deal from Lorient in 2021. The Democratic Republic of the
  Congo forward is the second striker to arrive at Newcastle in the space of a
  few days after Nick Woltemade’s arrival from Stuttgart for £70m. His signing
  comes on the day Liverpool agreed a £125m deal to sign Alexander Isak.
