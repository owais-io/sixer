  Terry Kupers can’t sleep. The veteran psychiatrist, author and solitary
  confinement expert, 81 and still working on multiple projects, is particularly
  troubled by the brutal spate of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)
  raids rocking communities around the US. “My father came from Russia, so I’m
  an immigrant’s son,” he said. “I can’t live with these raids. I need to do
  something about it.” Recently, “doing something” has meant putting the
  finishing touches on a new book, Ending Isolation: The Case Against Solitary
  Confinement, which Kupers co-authored with three others. Out on 4 September
  from Pluto Press, the book is an exhaustively researched takedown of solitary
  confinement: the practice of isolating an incarcerated person for hours, days,
  weeks or even years in a cell all their own. It’s a practice long decried by
  experts including Kupers, but despite their repeated warnings, researchers and
  advocates generally agree that anywhere between 75,000 and 80,000 people are
  locked in solitary confinement in the US on any given day. The true number
  could be much higher, and as the book points out, “there is no evidence that
  solitary confinement actually reduces violence. Instead, there are research
  findings that point strongly to the opposite conclusion, that solitary
  confinement worsens the problem of violence, both within prisons and in the
  public.” Considering this, Ending Isolation is a vital, systematic dismantling
  of every possible argument one could use to justify solitary confinement. The
  book covers everything from the history of solitary, the disturbing overlaps
  between sexual assault and isolation practices, and a deep dive into who gets
  “sent to the hole” (spoiler alert: it can be any prisoner at any time for the
  vaguest reasons that more than often defy logic). The chapters feature
  narratives from people who have lived through torturous isolation, which makes
  for a mentally fraying read that feels, at times, like you’re peeking behind a
  curtain in a room where you’re not meant to be. “Most people who go to
  solitary confinement are broken by the experience,” Kupers said in an
  interview with the Guardian. “They have what I’ve termed the decimation of
  life skills. They become unlearned in terms of how to relate to others, and in
  terms of the prison environment, they then get into more trouble when they get
  out of segregation.” Kupers’ insights are based on decades of interviews with
  people who have experienced solitary confinement in America’s prisons. His
  latest book offers the in-depth psychiatric research Kupers has previously
  delivered in five other books and hundreds of articles – only this time he’s
  joined by three co-authors, including two people who are currently
  incarcerated. Chris Blackwell, an award-winning journalist currently serving a
  decades-long sentence in Washington, kicks off the book with an engaging
  prologue recounting how he endured his first stint in solitary confinement at
  the age of 12. The experience “solidified my distrust for authority figures
  forever and drove me into a deep hate for ‘the system’”. He has now spent most
  of his life as part of that system. By age 18, he’d been arrested more than 20
  times. After killing a man during a drug-related robbery (“an act I would
  never be able to repair”, he writes) Blackwell received the 45-year sentence
  he is currently serving. More solitary confinement awaited, too. “Nothing is
  worse than becoming a target in prison,” he writes in the prologue. “I refused
  to comply with what I felt was a constant abuse of power, and guards refused
  to allow me to rebel without punishment for my actions.” Even after years in
  isolation, Blackwell says he is still struggling to understand the impact
  those experiences had on him. But he knows the good he offers – his writing,
  his advocacy – is in spite of solitary confinement. Kupers says Blackwell is
  representative of a large proportion of prisoners: “He didn’t have murder in
  his mind,” but he committed a terrible crime that will haunt him – and others
  – for the rest of their lives. When they started working together on this
  book, Kupers realized that if circumstances were different, he and Blackwell
  would have been close friends. He admires his intellect, the grassroots
  organization Blackwell helped co-found from behind bars, and the harrowing
  essays and incarceration accounts Blackwell has published in the Appeal, the
  New York Times, the Washington Post and many other outlets. “He happens to be
  behind bars and therefore his life is very limited and restricted,” Kupers
  said. “But it’s amazing what he’s done given those limits.” It was Blackwell
  who recruited Kupers to co-author the book alongside himself and Deborah
  Zalesne, a law professor at the City University of New York. Together,
  Blackwell and Zalesne had the personal testimonies and legal foundation
  covered; they needed Kupers to add the mental health angle. He does so
  convincingly, detailing how solitary confinement, especially when it’s
  prolonged, can cause severe anxiety, panic, sleep problems, psychotic behavior
  and severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Many people “sent to the hole”
  develop a compulsion for self-harm, and Kupers says this shouldn’t surprise
  anyone. “Prolonged solitary confinement is torture,” he writes. These repeated
  insights, while necessary, aren’t the main draw of the book. Rather, it’s the
  contributions of people such as Kwaneta Harris, Ending Isolation’s fourth and
  final co-author. Harris is an incarcerated writer whose work has helped shed
  light on the crisis of sexual assault in prisons. “I used to think there was a
  timeline for when people lost their minds in solitary confinement. Six months,
  two years, maybe five. I was wrong. The descent into madness doesn’t follow a
  schedule. Even now, back in medium-security, I wake up some mornings thinking
  I’m still in that cell,” she writes. Those passages, coupled with reams of
  research, leave no doubt that solitary confinement constitutes cruel and
  unusual punishment. The question, then, is if the practice will ever end.
  “There’s a split in correctional authorities,” Kupers said. “Probably around
  half think that solitary confinement is a very bad idea.” In Donald Trump’s
  second term, Kupers is concerned about the advent of places like Alligator
  Alcatraz. “This book is representative of this finding that ending solitary
  confinement is strategically extremely important in the context of what Ice is
  doing, for instance, and the emergence of a police state,” Kupers said. “If we
  required that people who are behind bars are entitled to the civil and human
  rights, which they are by law entitled to, if we gave them those rights,
  including due process, that would massively change what’s going on right now.”
  Kupers adds: “If we continue to treat people like monsters, that is exactly
  what they will become.” Ending Isolation: The Case Against Solitary
  Confinement comes out on 4 September from Pluto Press. The book’s release date
  coincides with the launch of a nationwide bus tour hosted by Unlock the Box.
