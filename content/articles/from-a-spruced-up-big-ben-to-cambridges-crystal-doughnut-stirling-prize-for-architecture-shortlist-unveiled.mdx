  Rather like contenders for best in show at Crufts, where the perfect chihuahua
  is obliged to do battle with the perfect great dane, the new British buildings
  vying for this year’s Stirling prize for excellence in architecture are
  supremely dissimilar in scale, style and purpose. The shortlist encompasses a
  medical research centre, almshouse, college of fashion, two houses and a
  quintessential national monument. Geographically, though, they are
  conspicuously less disparate, with four schemes in London, one in Hastings and
  one in Cambridge, which begs the question: is there really no noteworthy new
  architecture north of the Fens? Historically associated with pastoral
  benevolence and distressed gentlefolk, the almshouse gets a modern reboot by
  architects Witherford Watson Mann. Their Appleby Blue development in
  Bermondsey, London, is a place of care and shelter, but above all, social
  connection. The human theatre of residents in its voluminous garden room can
  be appreciated from the street through a glazed walkway projecting out along
  the main facade like a shop window. “The idea was to build right in the heart
  of the community, not to hide people away,” says project architect Stephen
  Witherford. Both in its architecture and operation, Appleby Blue is a
  consciously extroverted presence and a retort to the notion that older people
  (especially poorer older people) should be shunted to the margins, with
  adverse effects on their mental and physical health. Swiss practice Herzog and
  de Meuron’s forte is devising statement buildings for institutional clients,
  exemplified by the mammoth crystalline doughnut of the Discovery Centre,
  designed with BDP for pharma titan AstraZeneca. Being in Cambridge, albeit on
  a peripheral biomedical campus near Addenbrooke’s hospital, there are nods to
  the archetype of the college court (quads being the preserve of Oxford), with
  a lawn-lined central enclave. Wrapped in faceted glazing, which, through
  cunning flexes of geometry, becomes a sawtooth roof, it’s a classic object
  building in a landscape, executed with enviable precision, a piece of
  architectural haute couture that puts its dowdier campus neighbours in the
  shade. Formerly based in Oxford Street next to the John Lewis flagship store,
  the London College of Fashion (LCF) and its attendant satellites have now
  consolidated and decamped to Allies and Morrison’s “vertical campus” in the
  expanding cultural quarter of Stratford, London’s East Bank. While its 5,500
  students may hanker for John Lewis’s legendary haberdashery department, they
  have the compensation of soaring atriums, Escher-esque staircases and
  panoramic views from the LCF’s whopping 17 storeys. Billed as the highest
  higher education building in the UK, the LCF forms a muscular armature for a
  teeming anthill of creative endeavour. The two houses on the shortlist,
  Hastings House by Hugh Strange and Niwa House by Takero Shimazaki, are elegant
  exercises in how to create atypical, modern domestic spaces. Elevating an
  otherwise quotidian domestic refurbishment, Hugh Strange augments a floridly
  eccentric Victorian dwelling – all stained glass, fretted barge boards and
  decorative clay tiles – with a series of simple, interlocking timber-framed
  rooms. Niwa House transforms a derelict site at the back of a terrace in
  Southwark, London. The Japanese inflected design emphasises the relationship
  between house and garden (niwa), exploring the concept of engawa, a covered
  corridor running along the perimeter of traditional Japanese dwellings.
  Conceived as a modest, lightweight pavilion, the house is a continuous series
  of fluid, open-plan spaces, with sliding doors and glazed walls that open up
  to unify its interior with gardens and courtyards. And finally, after five
  years shrouded in Christo-like wrappings, the Palace of Westminster’s
  gleamingly restored Elizabeth Tower and the bongs of Big Ben within it resume
  their place at the heart of national life, courtesy of conservation
  specialists Purcell and a battalion of craftspeople. The most comprehensive
  repair programme in its 160 years restores Pugin’s original Victorian colour
  scheme of Prussian blue and gold for the four clock faces, strips away the
  bodges of previous restoration cycles and adds a new visitor lift, eliminating
  the ordeal of having to wheeze up 334 steps to the top of the tower. While the
  project represents a singular triumph of conservation, existential issues
  continue to assail the rotting, neo-gothic wedding cake of the Palace of
  Westminster, with its 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases, 31 lifts and three miles of
  corridors. The story so far is of rising costs as political and public debate
  grinds on about how to make it remotely fit for purpose. Predictions about a
  likely Stirling winner are always a hostage to fortune, but whoever scoops the
  tiara should know that the Stirling imprimatur is no guarantee of
  architectural immortality. Earlier this year, demolition was due to begin on
  Hodder Associates’ Centenary Building at the University of Salford, the very
  first winner of the prize in 1996. Lauded at the time as a “dynamic, modern
  and sophisticated exercise in steel, glass and concrete”, it stood empty for
  eight years, failed to be listed and will soon be razed to make way for new
  housing. • The winner of the RIBA Stirling prize 2025 will be announced live
  at London’s Roundhouse on 16 October
