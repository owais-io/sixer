  If we have learned anything about the Hundred as we near the end of its fifth
  season it is that people will see in it whatever they wish to. So Adam Zampa’s
  last-minute arrival in the Oval Invincibles squad from Australia, confirmed on
  Thursday, will be perceived by some as the welcome return of a global
  white-ball star, the leading wicket-taker in last season’s competition. Others
  will consider the very possibility of a team making a big, potentially
  decisive signing for just the final of a competition proof of its essential
  unseriousness. Another group might care about nothing but their own
  entertainment. Protest will be fuelled by the fact that the success of the
  Invincibles, who go into Sunday’s decider seeking a three-peat, and Oval-based
  teams in general, is perhaps starting to grate. They are something of an
  anomaly. The Hundred is structurally designed to promote inconsistency across
  seasons, unpredictability generally being seen as a positive trait in sporting
  competition and particularly important in a tournament with only eight teams
  and no relegation, circumstances that might allow it to become very stale very
  quickly. So Trent Rockets men, runners-up in this year’s table, have now
  finished first, second, third and fifth twice; while the team they face in
  Saturday’s eliminator, third-placed Northern Superchargers, have never
  finished in the same position twice. But the Invincibles have chosen
  stability, building their team around a core of players who have been there
  from the start (the new player-recruitment system expected to be introduced
  for next season aims to encourage more player movement, albeit around a small
  number of players on longer-term contracts). Familiarity is not the only
  ingredient of success but it is notable that the two worst teams in this
  season’s men’s competition, London Spirit and Welsh Fire, each have only one
  player who has made more than 25 appearances for them, while the Invincibles
  have six. Nine of the XI that started last year’s final have returned this
  year, while Sam Billings has captained them through 41 of their 42 games. Like
  the Invincibles, Southern Brave women have topped their table for the third
  time in five years – they have only once finished outside the top two, and
  that was last year when they came last – but so far they have only once
  converted their league success into a title. Last year they won one game and
  that with one ball to spare; Thursday’s victory over Welsh Fire, who collapsed
  from 50 for one to finish with 77 for nine, completed the first 100% record of
  any team, men or women, in the history of the tournament (unless you count
  Welsh Fire men’s eight defeats from eight in 2022). The England seamer Lauren
  Bell added another four wickets to an outstanding record for the Brave: she
  has the most wickets this season at the lowest average, and one of the few to
  come close to her combination of wickets (lots) and runs conceded (few) is her
  teammate Tilly Corteen-Coleman. Superchargers will be involved in both
  eliminators, with London Spirit their opponents in the women’s competition.
  The sides met less than a fortnight ago, when Superchargers romped to victory
  by eight wickets (they have become fearsome chasers, winning three of their
  last five games by eight wickets and one by seven, with a combined total of
  precisely 100 balls to spare), and for all that it’s their home ground Spirit
  have not won at Lord’s since they pipped the Invincibles in the first game of
  the season. Coached by Andrew Flintoff, captained by Harry Brook and with Ben
  Stokes involved as a non-playing mentor, their men’s team has been, well,
  supercharged by the unlikely figure of Zak Crawley, whose 280 runs this season
  already exceeds the number he scored in 2021, 2022 and 2023 combined (he did
  not play in 2024 because of injury). In 2023 he averaged 13 in five innings
  and overall had been so hopeless that Spirit cut him from their squad in
  February. The success of Crawley, like the Superchargers’ women, offers a
  romantic vision of a tournament that allows one season’s losers to become
  winners the next – a vision that may or may not survive contact with the
  remorseless juggernaut that is the Invincibles.
