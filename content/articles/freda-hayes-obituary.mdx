  My mother, Freda Hayes, who has died aged 88, was an artist and teacher. She
  spent most of her life in Cumbria, where she was an active member of the
  community in Keswick. She was a talented painter, though she never wanted to
  sell her work, but did occasionally give pieces away to friends. In the
  mid-1950s she had trained at Barrow Art School, where she became part of a
  small group of painters and potters who stayed connected well into their 80s
  and beyond. Freda was born in Kendal, to Laura Brand, but never knew her
  father, and was brought up by her single mother with practical and financial
  help from her uncle, William Brand, in Barrow-in-Furness, where she went to
  Barrow grammar school. It was William, a fitter at the local shipyard, who
  helped to nurture Freda’s artistic skills. Beginning at Barrow Art School in
  1955, she met Geoff Hayes, a fellow student, and they married in 1959, moving
  to Hampshire, where they both then worked as art teachers. When their two
  daughters, Sophie and me, were born in the mid-60s, Freda left teaching to
  look after the family, and they moved back north to the town of Brampton in
  Cumbria, where Geoff taught at Harraby school in Carlisle. In 1968 the family
  moved to Keswick, and Freda and Geoff found a community in which they would
  spend the next 60 years of their lives. She worked at various Keswick schools
  as a teaching assistant and also ran private drawing classes in her house. In
  the mid-70s Freda and a friend, Lyn Denny, opened an Oxfam shop in Keswick
  after taking a course. Later, for a year or so, she ran a weekly market stall
  in the town selling her own screenprinted tote bags. A socialist, Guardian
  reader, and member of CND and Cumbrians for Peace, she was also was active in
  the Keswick theatre club for more than 40 years. She was was an incredibly
  creative individual, always sewing, painting, holding art classes and
  encouraging others to learn to draw and paint. Geoff died in 2024. Freda is
  survived by Sophie and me, and six grandchildren, Harry, Flora, Milo, Anna,
  Finn and Jerry.
