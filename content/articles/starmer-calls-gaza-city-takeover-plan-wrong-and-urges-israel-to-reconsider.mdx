  Keir Starmer has urged Benjamin Netanyahu to reconsider his plans to take over
  Gaza City and said the move would only bring more bloodshed. The British prime
  minister said Israel’s decision to escalate a conflict that has killed tens of
  thousands of Palestinians over the past 22 months while pushing the territory
  into famine was wrong and would do nothing to secure the release of Israeli
  hostages. Israel’s security cabinet approved a plan to take over Gaza City at
  a meeting that began on Thursday and ran through the night. The plan falls
  short of taking over the whole of Gaza as Netanyahu said he had intended
  before the meeting. Starmer said Israel and Hamas should de-escalate the
  conflict and agree to a ceasefire, and that the prospect of a negotiated
  two-state solution was “vanishing before our eyes” without the two sides
  engaging “engaging in good faith in negotiations”. “Every day the humanitarian
  crisis in Gaza worsens and hostages taken by Hamas are being held in appalling
  and inhuman conditions. What we need is a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian
  aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas and a negotiated solution,” Starmer
  said. “Our message is clear: a diplomatic solution is possible, but both
  parties must step away from the path of destruction.” Several other countries,
  including Finland and Turkey, have criticised Israel’s announcement and called
  on its government to de-escalate the conflict. The leader of the Liberal
  Democrats, Ed Davey, said it was increasingly clear that Netanyahu’s goal was
  “ethnic cleansing” in Gaza. He urged Starmer to cease all arms exports to
  Israel and sanction Netanyahu and his cabinet. The energy minister Miatta
  Fahnbulleh told Sky News the Israeli government’s decision to take over Gaza
  City was wrong. “We think that it will risk escalating an already intolerable
  situation, and the consequence will be more bloodshed,” she said. “There’s no
  one that can see what is happening and unfolding in Gaza that isn’t horrified
  by it. “Our priority is, in order to try and get a ceasefire, we’ve got to get
  parties around the table. I know it feels incredibly hard given the current
  situation, but it has to be the priority.” Starmer has said the UK will
  recognise a Palestinian state before the UN general assembly in September if
  Israel does not agree to a ceasefire and a pathway towards a two-state
  solution. Before the meeting of his security cabinet, Netanyahu had set out a
  plan to take control of the whole of Gaza and eventually hand governance of
  the territory to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas. The plan announced on
  Friday morning stopped short of that after reservations from Israel’s top
  general who reportedly said it would endanger the remaining 20 or so living
  hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after nearly two years
  of war on various fronts. Many families of hostages are also opposed, fearing
  further escalation will doom their loved ones.
