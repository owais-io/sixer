  Every day, tens of thousands of people are thought to commute across the 8km
  bridge between Malmö and Copenhagen. The name of the bridge – Öresund if
  you’re Swedish or Øresund if you’re Danish – is one of only a few things that
  divide the people of the two cities. Another one is football. After Malmö beat
  Latvia’s RFS in a Champions League qualifier last week their winger Jens
  Stryger Larsen, who has more than 50 Denmark caps, led the club’s supporters
  in a vociferous chorus of “We hate Copenhagen” – the identity of their
  third-round opponents no secret, the draw already made. Stryger Larsen came
  through the ranks at Brøndby – FC Copenhagen’s fierce rivals – and is one of a
  couple of Danish players in the Malmö squad. His chanting was criticised by
  Danish police, who said it was “helping to stir up a hostile atmosphere”
  before the two-leg tie gets under way in Sweden on Tuesday. It will be an easy
  trip to the Eleda Stadion for Copenhagen’s travelling support: less than an
  hour by road or rail. Revellers are known to make the short hop to enjoy a
  cheaper night out in the industrial Swedish city than they can get in
  Denmark’s more regal capital. “Malmö is always going to be the little brother,
  city-wise,” says Agnes Gertten, who has commuted to Copenhagen for work in the
  past, of the Malmö fan association Supporterhuset. Despite the friendly
  relationship shared by Malmö and Copenhagen as cities, there is rivalry
  between MFF and FCK, felt more strongly from the Malmö side. Although the
  clubs play each other only occasionally – there have been two competitive
  meetings in the past two decades – that animosity stems from a Royal League
  encounter in 2005, when Danish police were accused of attacking away
  supporters in the stands after little provocation. The blame game was played
  and a three-year court case followed, with no individuals prosecuted. The
  teams’ first competitive meeting at Parken since then was in the Europa League
  in 2019, which the visitors won 1-0 to top their group. “For me, it was very
  emotional,” says Gertten, who will attend both legs over the next week. “We
  had just lost a friend earlier that year … he really hated Copenhagen. I cried
  like a baby. I think it was a feeling of being the greatest.” Scandinavian
  pride is at stake here. Bodø/Glimt’s recent rise has brought a new element,
  but MFF and FCK have spent much of this century as the region’s top dogs and
  vehicles for the Sweden-Denmark pan-sporting grudge. “We are the most
  successful club over here,” says William Galambos of MFF Support, “and they
  are the most successful club in Denmark. Both clubs are used to winning and
  want to be the best in Scandinavia.” Malmö and Copenhagen, winners of six of
  the past 10 titles in their respective domestic leagues, can attract the best
  of the rest in the region and an intermingling of nations is common. “Since we
  are the two big clubs, both in the stands and on the pitch, the best players
  in Scandinavia have their eyes on us and Copenhagen,” says Galambos. Anders
  Christiansen, the captain, is another Danish voice in the MFF dressing room,
  which includes the Malmö-born goalkeeper Robin Olsen, who won two Danish
  titles with FCK. Copenhagen’s captain is Viktor Claesson, a Swede, and they
  also have the forward Jordan Larsson, the son of Henrik. “The Swedish players,
  they are looking forward to it,” says David Bastian-Møller of the Copenhagen
  Sundays fan media. “Jordan Larsson agreed that it would be a nice game to play
  as a Swede.” From Malmö, there is talk of “hatred”, so how would Copenhagen
  describe the feeling towards their neighbours? “Insignificance,” smiles
  Bastian-Møller. “From a Copenhagen perspective, there is not really a rivalry.
  We have a huge rivalry with Brøndby, we meet them usually four times a season.
  Malmö, we don’t really pay attention to them.” But of course, he would say
  that. “A lot of Copenhagen supporters try to say that they don’t really care
  about us,” says Gertten. Both teams are two rounds from the Champions League
  proper, which neither took part in last season. “Barcelona in Parken, or Real
  Madrid, or one of the big English teams …” imagines Bastian-Møller when he
  thinks of potential match-ups. Malmö have already landed their dream
  opponents. “Each year when we are in Europe, we want to meet Copenhagen,” says
  Galambos. “That’s the only team we always want to meet.”
