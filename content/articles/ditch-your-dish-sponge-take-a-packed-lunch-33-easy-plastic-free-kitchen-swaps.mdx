  The world, according to a new expert review, is in a “plastics crisis”, driven
  by a huge acceleration in plastic production and a rise in single-use
  plastics. At a domestic level, it’s time to take action. Our kitchens in
  particular are full of plastic, from washing-up brushes to measuring jugs. And
  with a constant cycle of news stories about their possible harms – from black
  kitchen utensils that leak chemicals to chopping boards that release millions
  of microplastics – our kitchens can feel like a swamp of toxins. Many utensils
  can be replaced with wooden, metal, glass or even bamboo alternatives. We’re
  not suggesting you throw out all your plastic kitchen accessories in one go –
  it’s much more sustainable to use what you already have until it needs
  replacing than send a perfectly good plastic colander to landfill in the name
  of being more environmentally mindful. But when the time comes to replace your
  washing-up bowl or you eventually run out of clingfilm, here are a few of our
  favourite plastic-free kitchen swaps for you to consider. *** Simple
  plastic-free kitchen swaps *** Utensils Both wood and metal utensils have
  their pros and cons, and both need to be used and cared for correctly to get
  the most out of them. Wooden and bamboo utensils won’t damage the bottom of
  your pans, but they do need to be washed by hand with soapy water if you want
  them to last, and oiled if they start looking dry. Metal utensils are much
  less high maintenance and are often dishwasher-safe, but you need to take care
  when using them to avoid scratching your cookware. KitchenAid birchwood
  utensil set £32 at Dunelm £27.88 at Amazon This four-piece set comes with a
  spoon, fish slice, slotted spoon and slotted turner. A great choice if you
  like your kitchen to be pretty as well as functional, these lovely Birchwood
  utensils would look great hanging on the wall. Bambu bamboo spatula £3.95 at
  Friendly Turtle A utensil that can get into the awkward corners of your pans
  and bowls is always handy, and this bamboo spatula is shaped to do just that.
  KitchenCraft metal oval fish slice £6.99 at Season £6.40 at Amazon This oval
  fish slice is the ideal shape to slide under food stuck to your baking trays.
  It’s made from stainless steel, so it’s also dishwasher safe. ProCook bamboo
  tongs £2 at ProCook Whether you need to flip bacon or retrieve a crumpet
  lodged in the toaster (please switch it off at the wall first), these bamboo
  tongs are a handy kitchen tool. They have a built-in magnet so you can stick
  them to the side of your fridge or a metal kitchen appliance, saving you from
  endlessly fishing around in a drawer. *** Wooden chopping board There’s a
  misconception that wooden chopping boards are less hygienic than plastic, but
  studies have shown this isn’t the case. In fact, plastic chopping boards have
  been confirmed as a previously overlooked source of microplastics in our food.
  So wood is by far the best choice for a chopping board. As with utensils,
  though, wooden chopping boards do require a bit of extra care. Wash them
  thoroughly with soapy water after use (but never leave them to soak), and wait
  for them to dry out completely before storing, to prevent mould or cracking in
  the wood. Habitat industrial wood butcher’s block £25 at Argos This
  industrial-style board is made from dark acacia wood, formed in the classic
  chequerboard style of a butcher’s block. It’s so pretty you’ll want to
  permanently display it on your countertop. Season teak end grain chopping
  board From £70 at Season Made from sustainably sourced teak, which has natural
  moisture-resistant properties, this board has a groove around the edge to
  catch scraps of food and keep your countertops tidy. Season also sells its own
  oil to keep it in top condition. *** Metal colander Opt for a more durable
  stainless steel colander over a flimsy plastic one. This one from Dunelm has
  small enough holes that it can also double as a sieve. Dunelm Essentials
  stainless steel colander £5 at Dunelm *** Measuring jug It’s generally advised
  to avoid consuming hot liquids that have been exposed to plastic, as some
  plastics may shed microplastics or leak chemicals when exposed to heat. So if
  you’re partial to mixing up stock or measuring hot liquids in a plastic jug,
  it’s worth investing in an alternative. For a convenient and easy swap, go for
  a glass measuring jug – as these are readily available and often microwave and
  dishwasher safe. Pyrex glass measuring jug £6 at John Lewis £6 at Amazon This
  Pyrex jug has both imperial and metric measurements going up to 1L and 1 and
  1/2 pints. It’s microwave, dishwasher, oven and freezer safe, making it useful
  for food prep and storage as well as measuring. *** Measuring spoons You can
  buy measuring spoons made of stainless steel, china, copper, wood … the list
  goes on. And there’s no real benefit to plastic spoons over these more
  eco-friendly materials (with all of them being dishwasher-safe except for
  wood), so swapping them out is a no-brainer. Yvonne Ellen fine china measuring
  spoons £15.40 at John Lewis These cute measuring spoons come in jolly pastel
  colours to brighten up your baking. Tala stainless steel measuring spoons £8
  at John Lewis £5.95 at Amazon This Tala set comes with five measuring spoons,
  ranging from 1/4 teaspoon to a tablespoon, and they’re made from durable
  stainless steel. *** Washing-up bowl Washing-up bowls tend to be made of
  plastic, and most alternatives are made from stainless steel. While a little
  harder to come by than plastic, it’s worth seeking one out for stainless
  steel’s scratch- and odour-resistant qualities. Buckingham stainless steel
  washing-up bowl £22.99 at B&amp;Q £35.99 at Robert Dyas This round washing-up
  bowl has a simple but sturdy design. Its 11-litre capacity means it’s suitable
  for cleaning larger pots and pans, too. Elephant Box orange stainless steel
  washing-up bowl £48.50 at Elephant Box Elephant Box’s stainless steel
  washing-up bowl is big enough to fit 10in plates, and it’s bright orange so
  will add some cheer to your kitchen. ASelected rectangular stainless steel
  washing-up bowl From £19.99 at Amazon This rectangular bowl is ideal for
  washing up, but can also be used for washing vegetables or as a mixing bowl.
  It comes in three sizes. *** Dish brush If you search for a “washing-up
  brush”, you’ll be met with a deluge of plastic options, with many big
  retailers offering minimal to no alternatives. But you can find wooden
  washing-up brushes that use natural fibres for scrubbing. Wild &amp; Stone
  coconut fibre dish brush £4.95 at Wild &amp; Stone £8.99 at Amazon This brush
  from Wild &amp; Stone is made from 100% FSC-certified beechwood and
  sustainably sourced coconut fibre, meaning it’s mostly biodegradable. Just
  don’t leave the brush sitting in hot water, as the natural glue around the
  head may dissolve. Ecoliving wooden dish brush with replaceable head £3.56 at
  Natural Collection The bristles of this brush are made from plant fibres, and
  the head can be removed and replaced as needed. This saves you from having to
  buy a whole new brush, cutting down on waste. *** Scourers The scouring part
  of a standard kitchen sponge often includes plastic, which can shed and become
  a source of microplastics throughout our kitchens. But plant-based materials
  such as loofah and coconut fibres are naturally coarse and up to the task of
  scrubbing your pots and pans. Seep eco sponge scourers £26 for 12 at Seep Made
  from loofah and wood pulp cellulose, these sponges from Seep are safe to use
  on nonstick pans. A pack should last you a whole year. Regn coconut kitchen
  scourers From £3.50 for five at Regn These scourers are made from coconut
  fibres that are tough on grime and mess but gentle on your skin. They’re also
  biodegradable, so you can throw them away guilt-free when they’ve run their
  course. *** Washing-up liquid There are plenty of refillable washing-up
  liquids out there, which help to cut down on plastic by encouraging you to
  reuse a single bottle. However, many of them still involve plastic packaging
  for the refills. Not so for Iron &amp; Velvet’s water-soluble sachets, which
  are delivered inside cardboard packaging. Mix these with water in a dispenser
  to create the washing-up liquid. There’s no dispenser provided, as you’re
  encouraged to use one you already own to further cut down on waste. Iron &amp;
  Velvet washing-up liquid refill £3.50 for five sachets at Veo *** Dish drainer
  Wooden dish drainers can be tempting for a homespun look, but they also need
  to dry out completely between washes or they’ll go mouldy. Metal drainers are
  a more practical choice and much more aesthetically pleasing than their
  plastic counterparts. Habitat metal and bamboo dish drainer £25 at Argos This
  compact black metal drainer is the perfect size if you have a dishwasher and
  just want a little extra drying space between loads. Next two-tier drainer £28
  at Next No dishwasher? This grey two-tier drainer is ideal if you need a
  little more space for your washing-up. *** Storage containers Having storage
  pots of various sizes to stash leftovers is a great way to cut down on
  clingfilm. Most containers on the market involve a little bit of plastic (even
  if it’s just in the silicone seal between the pot and lid), but here are a few
  made entirely of stainless steel. A Slice of Green stainless steel oval lunch
  box From £18.95 at Natural Collection £24.95 at &amp;Keep This stainless-steel
  lunchbox with closure clips is perfect for storing leftover meals or taking
  lunch on the go. ZenithCart stainless steel storage pots £21.66 at Amazon This
  trio of pots comes with three sizes, making it easy to store half a lemon or
  other odds and ends. Elephant Box leakproof food canister trio £36 at Plastic
  Freedom These useful canisters are leakproof, thanks to their screw-top
  closure – and they’re pretty cute too. *** Beeswax wraps Another alternative
  to clingfilm is beeswax wraps. They’re made by coating a piece of material in
  beeswax to make it pliable and able to hold its shape when wrapped around any
  leftover food. They’re fairly easy to make, if you’re up for it, but if not,
  there are plenty of ready-made ones available. To maintain them, wash with
  washing-up liquid in cool water, to avoid melting the wax, and gently scrub to
  remove any residue. Once clean, lay them flat or hang them from a drainer to
  dry completely before storing. Tu-Untangle natural beeswax wraps £9.76 for
  three at Etsy This set of wraps includes three sizes in various fun patterns.
  Handy for taking a sandwich into the office. Honey Bee Good dandelion print
  beeswax wraps £14.99 for three at Honey Bee Good In a pretty dandelion print,
  these beeswax wraps come in a set of three different sizes. The largest is big
  enough to cover a dinner plate for easy leftover storage. *** Other ways to
  cut back on your kitchen plastic *** Use what you have Before buying new
  products, take a look at how you can use what you already own. Things such as
  jars and other resealable containers from shop-bought foods can be reused to
  keep leftovers fresh. If you are going to reuse plastic packaging from
  takeaways or microwave meals, check the labelling to ensure it is safe to use
  them in the freezer, microwave or dishwasher first. *** Cut down on plastic
  bottles Reduce your use of plastic bottles by having milk delivered in glass
  bottles from services such as the Modern Milkman. And if you have a penchant
  for fizzy drinks, you could invest in a carbonator to make them at home. A
  reusable water bottle can prevent you from having to constantly buy plastic
  bottles of water when out and about. Drinkmate OmniFizz sparkling water and
  soda maker £89.99 at B&amp;Q £89.99 at Amazon Chilly’s insulated drinks
  bottle, 500ml £24 at John Lewis £24 at Chilly’s *** Make your own cleaning
  products Clean &amp; Green by Nancy Birtwhistle £9.89 at the Guardian Bookshop
  £9.85 at Amazon Make your own cleaning products and put them in a reusable
  spray bottle to cut out the plastic packaging. This book is full of Nancy
  Birtwhistle’s eco-friendly and natural recipes and cleaning tips. *** Buy
  loose-leaf tea La Cafetière cast-iron three-cup teapot £39 at John Lewis £39
  at Dunelm Many brands of teabag contain plastic – even if they opt to use
  bioplastics such as PLA. So if you want your afternoon cuppa to be completely
  free of plastic, loose leaf is a safe bet. Get yourself a metal diffuser, or
  teapot with one built in, and enjoy. *** Refill shops or subscriptions Have
  you checked whether you have a local refill shop? Selling everything from food
  to cleaning products, they can be the answer to cutting down on all manner of
  plastic packaging. You can also buy the exact amount you need, helping to
  reduce waste. If you don’t have access to a local shop, there are plenty of
  refill subscriptions online for everything from laundry capsules to fruit and
  veg boxes. Check out 16 subscription services to save you time and money ***
  Take your lunch to work Thermos stainless steel food flask £23 at John Lewis
  £17.60 at Amazon Instead of picking up a plastic-wrapped supermarket meal deal
  or chain coffee-shop salad, take your own lunch into work in a flask or
  lunchbox. This can also save you money in the long run, particularly if you
  batch cook your lunches at the start of the week. A Thermos flask is a
  versatile container, ideal for keeping soup or curries hot and pasta salads
  cold. Filter editor Hannah Booth is such a fan that she bought two. Check out
  20 simple ways to cut down on plastic (and save money) *** Library of things
  It’s so easy to fall prey to the latest kitchen gadget, only to use it twice
  before it gathers dust on your countertop. Reduce waste by borrowing the kinds
  of appliances you’d use occasionally from a local library of things. They’re
  available all over the country and allow you to rent all manner of tools for
  as little as £1.50 a day. When browsing a few local libraries, I spotted
  everything from waffle makers to air fryers. Have you made thoughtful,
  eco-friendly swaps in your kitchen? Whether you’re actively trying to reduce
  plastic or you’ve eliminated it entirely, let us know by emailing
