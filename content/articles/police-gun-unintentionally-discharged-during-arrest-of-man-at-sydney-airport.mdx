  A man has been charged after an incident at Sydney airport this morning that
  involved a police gun being discharged inside the T2 domestic terminal. The
  Australian federal police said a Victorian man, 41, was arrested at Sydney
  airport on Wednesday morning after behaving suspiciously at a check-in
  counter. The man became aggressive towards police and a short-barrel rifle was
  unintentionally discharged during his arrest, the AFP acting commander Scott
  Raven told reporters. “The AFP officers approached the man after 6am following
  a report of suspicious behaviour. We allege the man became verbally and
  physically aggressive towards AFP officers before he was able to be placed
  under arrest,” he said. “During his arrest, the AFP firearm was
  unintentionally discharged. The circumstances of how the firearm, which was a
  short-barrelled rifle, was discharged is now subject to an internal
  investigation.” He said the bullet had lodged in an oven in a cafe a metre
  from where the gun was fired. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In a statement,
  the AFP said the man’s alleged aggressiveness towards police created a
  volatile situation. “Thankfully, there were no injuries as a result of the
  incident,” Raven said. He did not confirm whether the man was a passenger or
  held a boarding pass. Footage from the scene shared by Sydney radio station
  2GB via social media shows an individual on the ground, close to cafe serving
  and dining areas, being restrained by at least three others. A man can be
  heard shouting in the video. An armed police officer can be seen assisting in
  the restraint of the individual. Earlier, the AFP confirmed it had launched an
  investigation into the incident and a crime scene was established. There was
  no ongoing threat to the public. An airport spokesperson said there were no
  injuries and the airport was not locked down. The facility was operating as
  normal after the incident was resolved. “Sydney airport is currently assisting
  Australian federal police following an incident earlier this morning,” the
  spokesperson said. “No injuries occurred as a result of the incident. An
  arrest has been made and the airport is operating normally.” The man was
  charged with one count of obstructing a commonwealth official and one count of
  creating a disturbance at an airport. He was taken to Mascot police station
  and granted conditional bail. He is scheduled to appear before Downing Centre
  local court on 1 September.
