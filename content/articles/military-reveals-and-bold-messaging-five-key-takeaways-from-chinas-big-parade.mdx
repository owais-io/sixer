  Xi Jinping has presided over China’s largest-ever military parade,
  orchestrated to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war,
  which China calls the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. The event
  caps off a big week of diplomacy for China’s leader, coming just days after
  the Chinese city of Tianjin hosted a major summit for leaders of the global
  south. Who was there Dozens of world leaders – mostly from non-western nations
  – attended the event, but it was the grand entrance of Xi Jinping accompanied
  by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korean Kim Jong-un that grabbed the most
  attention. The image of the three authoritarian strongmen chatting and shaking
  hands as they walked the red carpet sent a message of defiance to the west,
  according to analysts. Other attendees included Belarus president Aleksandr
  Lukashenko, Iranian president Masoud Pezashkian, Indonesian president Prabowo
  Subianto and Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing. Who wasn’t there Leaders
  from the US, western Europe, Japan, India and South Korea were not in
  attendance. Among Chinese officials, there were not many significant absences
  immediately apparent. Missing Chinese Communist party (CCP) officials is one
  of the ways that China watchers figure out who might have fallen out of favour
  with Xi. Former Chinese leader Hu Jintao and former premier Zhu Rongji were
  not seen. Both are elderly, and Hu has been seen only once since he was
  unceremoniously bundled out of the 20th party congress in 2022. Messages sent
  and received The highly choreographed display and the formidable guest list
  were designed to send a message to the US and its allies about the strength of
  China today. In his opening address Xi said the world was facing “a choice
  between peace and war”, warning that China was a great nation that “is never
  intimidated by any bullies”, a likely veiled reference to the US and its
  allies. He said the past showed that Chinese people always rallied together
  “to defy the enemy” when faced with adversity. The images of Xi, Putin and Kim
  showed that “China is unafraid to stand by its friends and be their literal
  fellow traveller, even and perhaps especially when they are pariahs in the
  court of international public opinion,” said Wen-ti Sung, a non-resident
  fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. The parade drew an almost
  immediate reaction from US president Donald Trump. “Please give my warmest
  regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United
  States of America,” Trump posted on his Truth Social account. Military reveals
  The 70-minute parade displayed an eye-watering amount of military hardware.
  From tanks and drones to long-range and nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets
  and stealth aircraft, the parade also revealed advances in People’s Liberation
  Army (PLA) weapons and assets. The display was intended to “give the US,
  Europe and China’s neighbours pause should they consider challenging China’s
  core national interests”, said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S
  Rajaratnam school of international studies. There were reported sightings of
  the J15-DT – China’s new, carrier-based electronic warfare jet. Raymond Kuo,
  director at Rand corporation, described it as a flying support system and
  decoy for fighter jets, keeping track of moving targets for the fighters, and
  drawing counterattacks away from them. Kuo also noted a new submarine-launched
  intercontinental ballistic missile, demonstrating progress in China’s efforts
  to build a “triad” of nuclear missile systems that complement each other and
  offset each other’s weaknesses by launching from the land, air and sea. A key
  takeaway for Ying-Yu Lin, an associate professor at the institute of
  international affairs and strategic studies at Tamkang University in Taiwan,
  was a growing emphasis on counter-drone systems and airborne early warning
  aircraft. “I think these changes come from lessons drawn from the
  Russia-Ukraine war, where we saw drones being widely used.” Jennifer Parker,
  adjunct fellow in naval studies at UNSW Canberra, said it was important to
  “break apart” real capability from what she called China’s information warfare
  campaign. “Associated with parades or exercises or demonstrations is always a
  huge degree of deception,” she said. “But I don’t think we should
  underestimate China’s capabilities - they are a very capable military, and I
  think we should be quite concerned.” Taiwan Xi’s speech contained several
  references to the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” – a common phrase for
  Xi’s overarching plan for China’s future which hinges on annexing Taiwan as
  Chinese territory. Xi and the CCP claim Taiwan is a Chinese province,
  currently run by illegal separatists, and he has vowed to annex it under what
  he terms “reunification”. Taiwan’s government and people are opposed to this.
  In Taiwan, President Lai Ching-te dismissed the parade, saying: “The people of
  Taiwan cherish peace, and Taiwan does not commemorate peace with the barrel of
  a gun.” Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Daisy Dumas
