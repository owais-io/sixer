  Pick of the week The Brutalist The ongoing trauma of the Holocaust casts a
  shadow over this epic and intensely felt postwar drama from Brady Corbet. It’s
  also a tale of art v commerce, as Adrien Brody’s Jewish-Hungarian
  concentration camp survivor László comes to the US and resumes his career as
  an architect famed for his brutalist style, supported by his wife Erzsébet
  (Felicity Jones). His new employer, industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren (a
  superbly self-regarding Guy Pearce), envisions a grandiose community centre on
  the top of a hill. It is their relationship that forms the dark heart of the
  film, as László’s obsession with creative purity clashes with Harrison’s ego,
  envy and financial might. Friday 5 September, 9pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** The
  Quick and the Dead Back in 1995 – when she was a far bigger draw than Russell
  Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio – Sharon Stone starred alongside them in Sam
  Raimi’s jolly spaghetti western homage. Cowgirl Ellen rides into the town of
  Redemption on the eve of a sharp-shooting competition organised by the
  autocratic mayor, Herod (Gene Hackman). She seems to have a beef with him, but
  what is it? Also intrigued by her are Crowe’s outlaw turned pacifist preacher
  Cort and DiCaprio’s braggadocious teenage gunslinger the Kid, in a reworking
  of Sergio Leone’s greatest tricks. Saturday 30 August, 9pm, 5Action ***
  Sisters In this 1972 murder mystery, Brian De Palma succumbed fully to his
  Hitchcock obsession – he even got Bernard Herrmann to do the score.
  Thankfully, he’s very good at it, offering up a warped tale of twin sisters
  (one sweet, the other psychotic, both played by Margot Kidder), a missing body
  in a Staten Island apartment, and a crusading journalist (Jennifer Salt) who
  lives opposite and is determined to solve the case. It was also De Palma’s
  first sustained use of split screen, providing double the plot and double the
  sweaty tension. Tuesday 2 September, 11.50pm, Talking Pictures TV *** The
  Fisher King Terry Gilliam’s most romantic drama may well be his best. After
  New York radio shock jock Jack (Jeff Bridges) inspires a mass shooting, his
  life falls apart. Then he meets Robin Williams’s Parry, a mentally ill
  down-and-out on a quest for the holy grail – and the heart of Amanda Plummer’s
  klutzy Lydia. Because Parry’s wife was killed in the massacre, Jack seeks
  redemption by helping him with both wishes. Comedy and fantasy mingle
  delightfully, while Mercedes Ruehl is on Oscar-winning form as Jack’s
  long-suffering girlfriend. Thursday 4 September, 3.05pm, Sky Cinema Greats ***
  Rebecca Joan Fontaine delivers a perfectly calibrated rabbit-in-the-headlights
  performance in Alfred Hitchcock’s first US film, a fervid adaptation of Daphne
  du Maurier’s gothic mystery. A whirlwind romance with the brooding Maxim
  (Laurence Olivier) doesn’t prepare the second Mrs de Winter (Fontaine) for
  life at his Cornish stately pile, Manderley, where the memory of his drowned
  wife is sustained by the forbidding, fetishistic housekeeper Mrs Danvers
  (Judith Anderson). Thursday 4 September, 4.30pm, Talking Pictures TV ***
  Reality A verbatim dramatisation of an FBI interview doesn’t sound like a
  ripsnorter, but Tina Satter’s 2023 ripped-from-the-headlines drama is
  genuinely gripping. NSA linguist Reality Winner (Sydney Sweeney) comes home to
  be faced by federal agents – led by Josh Hamilton’s Garrick and Marchánt
  Davis’s Taylor – who want to talk to her about the leak of classified
  information about Russian interference in US elections. Redacted dialogue is
  represented imaginatively by characters simply vanishing, but it is Sweeney’s
  gradual disintegration in the face of the evidence that is the most
  compelling. Thursday 4 September, 9pm, Film4 *** Highest 2 Lowest In his
  vibrant adaptation of Ed McBain’s thriller King’s Ransom (by way of Kurosawa’s
  1963 film High and Low), Spike Lee gets to indulge in his love of New York.
  Basketball, baseball, hip-hop, Puerto Rican music, the subway – the rich
  pageant of city life suffuses the action as record company legend David King
  (Denzel Washington) faces a moral dilemma. The son of his longtime chauffeur
  Paul (Jeffrey Wright) is accidentally kidnapped instead of his own. So should
  still he pay the $17.5m ransom, even though it will mean losing control of his
  label? Friday 5 September, Apple TV+
