  More than 50,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats since Keir
  Starmer became prime minister, official figures have confirmed. Home Office
  data released on Tuesday showed that 50,271 people, most of whom successfully
  claimed asylum, have arrived in the UK from France since Labour won the
  general election in July 2024. A total of 474 people arrived on Monday. The
  milestone comes as the issue of irregular migration, and where to house asylum
  seekers while their claims are being processed, continues to haunt the
  government. Starmer came into power 13 months ago careful to avoid repeating
  the last government’s promise to “stop the boats”. However, the prime minister
  has promised to “smash the gangs” behind Channel crossings. But figures show
  that despite a number of initiatives from the Home Office in conjunction with
  other European governments, the number of people who arrived in the UK via
  small boats in the first half of this year was 48% higher than in the same
  period last year. Rishi Sunak, the last Conservative prime minister, took 603
  days in office to pass the 50,000 milestone, while it took Boris Johnson 1,066
  days during the Covid-19 pandemic. The government is increasing its efforts to
  bring down migration, announcing on Friday that the new “one in, one out”
  returns deal with France was up and running. The Home Office has also expanded
  its “deport now, appeal later” scheme, under which foreign criminals have been
  deported before their appeals have been heard. Reports claiming that the
  50,000 figure would be reached on Tuesday were “unacceptable”, a government
  minister said, shortly before the figures were released officially. Lady
  Jacqui Smith of Malvern, a former home secretary under Gordon Brown, said it
  showed how embedded criminal gangs had become under the previous Conservative
  government. Official figures from Monday suggested 49,797 people had crossed
  in small boats from northern France. She told BBC Breakfast: “It is an
  unacceptable number of people. It sort of demonstrates the way over the last
  six or seven years that the criminal gangs have got an absolute foothold in
  the tragic trafficking of people across the Channel.” Kemi Badenoch claimed
  she would reduce the number of boat arrivals to zero “quickly” by reigniting
  the £700m Rwanda deportation scheme and opening detention centres for asylum
  seekers. Addressing journalists on the Isle of Wight, the Conservative leader
  said: “My team are now looking at what we can do in terms of detention
  centres, but [also] stopping people from coming here in the first place: if
  they think they’re going to be sent to Rwanda and not get here, get a free
  hotel, get benefits, then they won’t come here.” Asylum seekers are not
  allowed to work until their claims have been considered. Because of an asylum
  backlog, many have lived in taxpayer-funded hotels for more than a year.
  French authorities confirmed a woman died on Monday while trying to board a
  boat to make the crossing to the UK. The woman, believed to have been in her
  30s, died on Malo beach in Dunkirk, according to the Utopia 56 organisation,
  which supports displaced migrants at the French border. The incident happened
  at about 4am on Monday , according to local media. French authorities said she
  died despite resuscitation efforts from emergency services at the scene on the
  French coast. The Home Office said it was aware of the incident but would not
  be commenting further. According to the International Organization for
  Migration, a UN agency, at least 20 people have died this year attempting to
  cross the Channel.
