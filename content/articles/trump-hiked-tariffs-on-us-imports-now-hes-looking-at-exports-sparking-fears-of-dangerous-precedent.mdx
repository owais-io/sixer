  Apple CEO Tim Cook visited the White House bearing an unusual gift. “This box
  was made in California,” Cook reassured his audience in the Oval Office this
  month, as he took off the lid. Inside was a glass plaque, engraved for its
  recipient, and a slab for the plaque to sit on. “The base was made in Utah,
  and is 24-karat gold,” said Cook. Donald Trump appeared genuinely touched by
  the gift. But the plaque wasn’t Cook’s only offering: Apple announced that day
  it would invest another $100bn in US manufacturing. The timing appeared to
  work well for Apple. That day, Trump said Apple would be among the companies
  that would be exempt from a new US tariff on imported computer chips. The Art
  of the Deal looms large in the White House, where Trump is brokering
  agreements with powerful tech companies – in the midst of his trade war – that
  are reminiscent of the real estate transactions that launched him into fame.
  But in recent days, this dealmaking has entered uncharted waters. Two days
  after Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had a closed-door meeting with Trump at
  the White House. The president later announced Nvidia, along with its rival
  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), will be allowed to sell certain artificial
  intelligence chips to Chinese companies – so long as they share 15% of their
  revenue with the US government. It was a dramatic about-face from Trump, who
  initially blocked the chips’ exports in April. And it swiftly prompted
  suggestions that Nvidia was buying its way out of simmering tensions between
  Washington and Beijing. Trade experts say such a deal, where a company
  essentially pays the US government to export a good, could destabilize trading
  relations. Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
  International Economics, said that it creates “the perception that export
  controls are up for sale”. “If you create the perception that licenses, which
  are supposed to be determined on pure national security grounds, are up for
  sale, you potentially open up room for there to be this wave of lobbying for
  all sorts of really, dangerous, sensitive technologies,” Chorzempa said. “I
  think that’s a very dangerous precedent to set.” Though the White House
  announced the deal, it technically hasn’t been rolled out yet, likely because
  of legal complications. The White House is calling the deal a
  “revenue-sharing” agreement, but critics point out that it could also be
  considered a tax on exports, which may not be legal under US laws or the
  constitution. The “legality” of the deal was “still being ironed out by the
  Department of Commerce”, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told
  reporters this week. Nvidia and AMD’s AI chips are at the heart of the
  technological arms race between the US and China. Nvidia, which became the
  first publicly traded company to reach a $4tn valuation last month, creates
  the essential processing chips that are used to run and develop AI. The US
  government has played a role in this arms race over the last several years,
  setting regulations on what AI chips and manufacturing equipment can be sent
  to China. If China has less computing power, the country will be slower to
  develop AI, giving a clear advantage to the US. But despite the restrictions,
  China has been catching up, raising questions on how US policy should move
  forward. “They haven’t held them back as far as the advocates had hoped. The
  US has an enormous computing advantage over China, but their best models are
  only a few months behind our best models,” Chorzempa said. For US
  policymakers, “the question they’ve had to grapple with is: Where do you draw
  the line?” The AI chips Nvidia and AMD can now sell to China aren’t considered
  high-end. While they can be used for inference on trained models, they aren’t
  powerful enough to train new AI models. When announcing the deal with Nvidia
  and AMD, Trump said the chip is “an old chip that China already possesses …
  under a different label”. This is where a major debate on AI policy comes in.
  Those who take a hardline stance on the US’s relationship with China say that
  allowing Chinese companies to purchase even an “old chip” could still help the
  country get an advantage over the US. Others would say a restriction on such
  chips wouldn’t be meaningful, and could even be counterproductive. To balance
  these two sides, the Trump administration is asking companies to pay up in
  order to export to China – a solution that people on both sides of the AI
  debate say is a precarious one. “Export controls are a frontline defense in
  protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that
  incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that
  will enhance AI capabilities,” said John Moolenaar, a Republican US
  representative from Michigan, in a statement. But Trump’s gut-reaction to
  dealmaking seems focused on the wallet. On Wednesday, US treasury secretary
  Scott Bessent praised the arrangement and suggested it could be extended to
  other industries over time. “I think that right now this is unique, but now
  that we have the model and the beta test, why not expand it?” he told
  Bloomberg. Julia Powles, executive director of the Institute for Technology,
  Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the deal
  opens up questions of whether similar pressure can be applied to other tech
  companies. “What other quid pro quo might be asked in the future? The quid pro
  quo that would be of great concern to the [tech] sector is anything that
  reduces their reputation for privacy and security,” Powles said. “That’s
  thinking of government like a transactional operator, not like an institution
  with rules about when, how and for what it can extract taxes, levies and
  subsidies.” But that seems to be how the White House runs now. When explaining
  to the press how he made the deal, Trump said he told Huang: “I want 20% if
  I’m going to approve this for you”. “For the country, for our country. I don’t
  want it myself,” the president added. “And he said, ‘Would you make it 15?’ So
  we negotiated a little deal.”
