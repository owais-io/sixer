  Ghislaine Maxwell, the associate of Jeffrey Epstein who is currently serving a
  20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes, has been transferred from
  a federal prison in Florida, to a lower-security facility in Texas, the US
  Bureau of Prisons said on Friday. “We can confirm, Ghislaine Maxwell is in the
  custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) at the Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Bryan
  in Bryan, Texas,” a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said in a
  statement. Maxwell’s attorney, David Oscar Markus, also confirmed the transfer
  but declined further comment. FPC Bryan is described as a “minimum security
  federal prison camp” that houses 635 female inmates. According to the Bureau
  of Prisons’ inmate locator, the Texas facility is also home to Elizabeth
  Holmes, the disgraced former CEO of the California-based blood-testing company
  Theranos, who is serving a lengthy sentence for fraud. Real Housewives of Salt
  Lake City TV star Jen Shah is also serving time there for fraud. Maxwell’s
  move from FCI Tallahassee, a low-security prison, to the federal prison camp
  in Bryan comes roughly a week after she was interviewed in Florida over two
  days about the Epstein case by the deputy US attorney general, Todd Blanche,
  who is also one of Donald Trump’s former lawyers. Blanche had said that he
  wanted to speak with Maxwell – who was sentenced in 2022 for sex trafficking
  and other related crimes – to see if she might have “information about anyone
  who has committed crimes against victims”. Details of that meeting have not
  been made public but Maxwell’s lawyer described it as “very productive”,
  adding that Maxwell answered the questions “honestly, truthfully, to the best
  of her ability”. The interview took place amid growing political and public
  pressure on the Trump administration to release additional federal documents
  related to the Epstein case – a case which has, for years, been the subject of
  countless conspiracy theories. Earlier in July, the justice department drew
  bipartisan criticism and backlash after announcing that it would not be
  releasing any more documents from the investigation into the late Epstein, who
  died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting federal trial. This was
  despite earlier pledges to release more files, by the US president and the US
  attorney general, Pam Bondi. Last week, the House of Representatives committee
  on oversight and government reform subpoenaed Maxwell to testify via
  deposition later this month. In response, Maxwell’s lawyer sent a letter to
  lawmakers this week stating that Maxwell was willing to testify but only if
  certain conditions are met, including being granted immunity. In that same
  letter, Maxwell also made a plea for clemency. But on Friday, the House
  indefinitely postponed that deposition. Meanwhile, Maxwell has petitioned the
  US supreme court to overturn her conviction. • The headline of this article
  was amended on 4 August 2025 to refer to Ghislaine Maxwell as Jeffrey
  Epstein’s accomplice.
