  After a summer recess dominated by headlines about Reform UK’s hardline
  immigration proposals and protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, the
  home secretary returned to parliament seeking to wrest back control of the
  narrative. Yvette Cooper has announced a flurry of tough asylum measures
  including suspending refugee family reunion applications, and even floated the
  idea that refugees could be moved out of hotels and into warehouses instead.
  She promised MPs that ministers were doing their bit to help those fleeing
  persecution, in “the British way”. But will ministers be caught between its
  promises of compassion and tough talk of migration? What has happened to the
  refugee family reunion process? The government has temporarily suspended new
  refugee family reunion applications as ministers want to prove that refugees
  will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions “as everyone
  else”. People who have had their asylum claims accepted will now have to apply
  through the standard family scheme that applies to UK citizens, who are
  required to show that they have a joint income of at least £29,000 a year
  before they are allowed to bring a partner to the UK. Cooper said changes will
  be made to the family reunion routes process, and will eventually become law
  in spring. Campaigners have warned this is one of the only safe, legal routes
  available for refugees fleeing persecution or war to be reunited with their
  partner or child. Some MPs have highlighted remarks Cooper made four years
  ago, when she said: “If there are not safe, legal routes for family reunion we
  end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous criminal gangs.”
  Will there be an end to hotel accommodation for asylum seekers? The government
  has vowed to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029. At least 32,000 asylum
  seekers currently occupy them at a huge cost to the taxpayer. Ministers say
  they will need to be closed “as swiftly as possible” but in “an orderly and
  sustainable manner”. Government insiders say they expect five more hotels
  housing asylum seekers to close by the end of the year, with more to follow in
  the new year. As of Monday, single adults who are granted asylum will be given
  28 days to move out of their temporary housing. Ministers have reduced the
  existing 56-day timeframe to help reduce the number of people staying in
  hotels. But it could push more asylum seekers on to the streets. Cooper went
  further on Tuesday after her measures dominated the front pages. She suggested
  asylum seekers could be housed in warehouses. The prime minister’s
  spokesperson said the government was indeed looking at “using modular
  buildings on industrial sites, ex-military sites”. A timeline has not been
  outlined for this. How has the asylum appeals system changed? Judges will no
  longer have power to hear appeals made by asylum seekers. Instead, the
  government has set up a new independent body “staffed by professionally
  trained adjudicators” to ensure high standards. It is hoped that this will
  operate in a similar way to the magistrates system, with trained members of
  the public hearing cases under the supervision of legal experts. Ministers
  hope this will speed up the process of asylum appeals. Will asylum seekers be
  returned to France? Ministers have been referring to the UK-France agreement
  as a great example of how the government is taking action to “smash the gangs”
  by returning a small number of asylum seekers who arrive via small boats to
  France. Cooper said the first returns would begin “later this month”, as the
  first detentions of asylum seekers on small boats took place the day after the
  deal was ratified in August. Although this is a pilot scheme, ministers hope
  they can continue to develop and expand it. Why is there a crackdown on
  foreign students? Tens of thousands of foreign students have been contacted by
  the Home Office to say they will be deported if they overstay their visas. The
  government launched the campaign in hope of cutting the numbers of students
  making asylum claims. In the year to June 2025, 431,725 visas were granted to
  foreign students who had come to the UK to study. What are the political
  risks? The government wants to press ahead with these tough measuresto take on
  Reform UK. Starmer told his cabinet ministers that migration is a “central
  issue” to his government and he understands the “frustration people feel at
  the level of illegal crossings and the sight of asylum hotels in their
  communities”. Despite ministers’ tough talk, the Conservatives immediately
  said Starmer “doesn’t have the stomach” to take stronger action. Farage did
  not directly respond to the measures, but the fact that the prime minister had
  to spend a lot of his media round on Monday attacking Farage spoke volumes.
  Labour MPs and refugee charities have swiftly criticised the measures,
  particuarly the suspension of the refugee family reunion process. The
  government has been accused of pushing children “into the arms of people
  smugglers”.
