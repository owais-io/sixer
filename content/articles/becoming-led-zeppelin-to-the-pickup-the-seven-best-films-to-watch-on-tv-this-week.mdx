  Pick of the week Becoming Led Zeppelin The archetypal origin story for a band
  is a bunch of schoolmates who pick up instruments and stumble on a hit sound.
  But, as Bernard MacMahon’s terrific, archive-stuffed documentary reveals, Led
  Zeppelin had a more roundabout gestation. Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist
  John Paul Jones were in-demand session players in 60s London, while singer
  Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham were jobbing musicians in Birmingham. It
  wasn’t until Page joined the Yardbirds that he realised his dream of a
  no-singles group with a heavy, improvisational edge. Featuring interviews with
  the surviving members, rare audio of Bonham and big chunks of gig footage,
  it’s a fascinating slice of rock history. Saturday 9 August, Sky
  Documentaries, on demand The Pickup Russell (Eddie Murphy) is an armoured
  truck guard edging towards retirement who is paired with irritating newbie
  Travis (Pete Davidson) on a long day of deliveries. However, their van is
  targeted by criminals led by Keke Palmer’s Zoe, forcing a change of plans for
  all involved. Oddly, Tim Story’s chase caper turned heist thriller makes
  Murphy the straight man to Davidson’s goofball, at the expense of the star’s
  comic abilities. But the confident, charismatic Palmer takes up some of the
  slack, and the highway action sequences are smartly done. Out now, Prime Video
  Back to the Future Part III Shot back to back with Part II, the final part of
  the sci-fi trilogy is a much better film, largely due to the fun everyone
  seems to be having with the western setting. Dusting off the DeLorean, Marty
  McFly (Michael J Fox) flies back to 1885 to save Christopher Lloyd’s stranded
  Doc Brown from being shot dead by Buford Tannen, Biff’s ancestor. Playful
  tweaks to the genre and a romance for Doc with Mary Steenburgen’s teacher are
  the new elements in an otherwise familiar plot of cobbled-together gadgetry,
  space-time dilemmas and jolly slapstick comedy. Saturday 9 August, 3.35pm, BBC
  One Margrete: Queen of the North Charlotte Sieling’s 2021 historical drama
  takes a footnote from the life of a 14th-century Danish royal and gives it a
  dusting of Game of Thrones-style clan politics, generational scheming and
  nation building. The estimable Trine Dyrholm is magnetic as Margrete, who –
  despite being a woman in a man’s world – has unified Norway, Sweden and
  Denmark and presides over a time of peace. Then a man appears claiming to be
  her long-dead son, which puts her adopted heir Erik (Morten Hee Andersen) in a
  funk and threatens to destabilise her hard-won pact. Saturday 9 August,
  1.05am, BBC Two Jimmy’s Hall Eight years after his 2006 film The Wind That
  Shakes the Barley delved into the 1920s Irish war of independence and civil
  war, Ken Loach returned to the country to assess its uneasy peace circa 1932.
  In an absorbing, fact-based story, communist Jimmy (Barry Ward) returns from
  the US to his County Leitrim home to reopen a community hall, which exposes
  the continuing rift between the working class and “the masters and the
  pastors” who dictate their lives and block democratic change. Sunday 10
  August, 1.10am, Film4 Grand Hotel “I want to be alone!” Greta Garbo is at her
  most diva-ish in this 1932 Oscar winner, a seductive pre-Code melodrama set
  exclusively in an opulent Berlin hotel. She is a depressed ballerina given a
  new lease of life after falling for John Barrymore’s Baron Felix von Geigern.
  Sadly, he has plans to steal her jewels to pay off his debts – but he’s also
  in love with her so it’s not a simple proposition. Lionel Barrymore’s
  terminally ill bookkeeper, a young Joan Crawford as a flirtatious stenographer
  and Wallace Beery’s bumptious factory owner are other guests adding to the
  social whirl. Thursday 14 August, 7pm, BBC Four Roxanne This 1987 romantic
  comedy is Steve Martin in his cinematic pomp, melding physical humour and
  dramatic purpose to beguiling effect. His own adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac
  transposes the action to a small US town, where fire chief CD (Martin) has a
  very, very long nose but is a whip-smart, outgoing local personality. Daryl
  Hannah plays the titular love interest, an astronomy student who admires the
  looks of Rick Rossovich’s nice-but-dim firefighter Chris but really likes the
  eloquent words CD puts into his courting colleague’s mouth. Friday 15 August,
  6pm, Sky Cinema Greats
