  Sir George Reid, who has died aged 86, was a Scottish politician, broadcaster
  and all-round public figure who also spent a dozen years as director of public
  affairs for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent in Geneva, a post he
  held between two separate phases of his political career. Reid was elected as
  a Scottish National party MP to the House of Commons in the general election
  of February 1974, but lost his seat five years later. Twenty years on he was
  elected to the new Scottish parliament, and in 2003 became its second
  presiding officer. Reid later reflected that in his 12 years with the Red
  Cross he “did far more good than at any other time in my life”. As well as
  overhauling the organisation’s image and communications strategy, he served on
  the frontline in war and disaster zones around the world, including following
  the Ethiopian famine and the 1988 Armenian earthquake. Joining the Red Cross
  in 1984, he was soon embroiled in the famine work, noting later that “about 5
  million people were going to die unless we got food to them and it had been
  left too late by the African authorities”. He used his broadcasting
  connections to encourage the BBC to make Michael Buerk’s documentary film on
  the topic, which, in turn, inspired the Live Aid movement. In 1990 he
  co-wrote, with Michèle Mercier, an influential study of Red Cross and Red
  Crescent identity, which found that both bodies had excellent trust levels at
  a national level, but much less so internationally, with many people believing
  them to be “an agency of government, or a Swiss organisation or ‘something to
  do with the United Nations’”. The study’s recommendations led to lasting
  changes in the mission statement of the organisation, plus a greater public
  emphasis on its independence from governments and its frontline work in the
  face of wars and disasters. Reid was born in Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, to
  George, a company director, and Margaret (nee Forsyth). He was educated at
  Tullibody school, Dollar academy and St Andrews University, where he graduated
  with first-class honours in Russian history and was president of the Students
  Representative Council. Afterwards he went into journalism, initially as a
  features writer with the Daily Express, but quickly moving to television with
  STV, where he became well-known as a personable presenter and political
  reporter, before joining the BBC in 1968. Along with his strong local
  credentials, this recognition factor made him an ideal SNP candidate for his
  home seat of Clackmannan and Eastern Stirlingshire. In February 1974 he gained
  the seat from Labour as one of seven SNP candidates elected. Eight months
  later that tally increased to 11. At Westminster he became a member of the UK
  delegation to the Council of Europe and specialised in international affairs.
  At home his media skills were well utilised by his party as its spokesman on
  health. However, Reid later said that during these years the party was riven
  by “constant struggles over power and purpose” between SNP MPs in London and
  headquarters in Edinburgh. The SNP lost nine of its 11 MPs in the 1979 general
  election after they voted with Margaret Thatcher in her confidence vote to
  bring down the Callaghan government. Reid lost his seat by fewer than 1,000
  votes. Initially he returned to broadcasting as a documentary maker and
  current affairs presenter for BBC Scotland, before taking up his post in
  Geneva. By the mid-1990s he was again active in SNP politics. After failing to
  be elected in the Ochil constituency in the 1997 general election, he became a
  regional MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife two years later. He lost out to David
  Steel in a bid to become the parliament’s first presiding officer, but was
  eventually elected to the post four years later. Far from being the consensual
  institution that many of its advocates had hoped for, Holyrood turned out to
  be a fractious place, with the costs of the parliament building itself one of
  the main bones of contention. Reid, who was generally seen as a calming figure
  during this period, told his fellow MSPs: “I sometimes wish that in this
  building we could do what we did in Africa when it comes to problem solving –
  all sit under a tree for three days until we’ve cracked it. Just talk and talk
  and talk. It can be a slow process, but by and large you come to almost
  universal consensus and it’s not a bad way of doing business.” While he
  remained firm in his pro-independence views, Reid’s reputation as a
  conciliatory figure opened up to him a series of public roles after he retired
  from Holyrood in 2007. These included chairing a review of the Northern
  Ireland Assembly in an attempt to give it “a fresh start”, and membership of
  the EU’s Caucasus-Caspian diplomatic commission. At home he was the Queen’s
  high commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and was
  made a Knight of the Order of the Thistle in 2022. He is survived by his wife,
  Daphne (nee McColl), whom he married in 1968, and their daughter, Morag. •
