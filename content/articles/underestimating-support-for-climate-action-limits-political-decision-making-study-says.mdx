  study says

  Politicians and policymakers significantly underestimate the public’s
  willingness to contribute to climate action, limiting the ambition and scope
  of green policies, according to research. Delegates at the United Nations
  Environment Assembly (UNEA) were asked to estimate what percentage of the
  global population would say they were willing to give 1% of their income to
  help fix climate change. The average estimate was 37%, but recent research
  found the true figure is 69%. The same research found 89% thought their
  national government “should do more to fight global warming”. The findings
  follow a recent call for a climate policy reset from the former UK prime
  minister Tony Blair, who claimed emission reduction policies lack public
  support. For the study authors, the large disparity between the perceived and
  actual figures was a worrying case of what they called “pluralistic
  ignorance”, wherein people systematically underestimate the willingness of
  their fellow citizens to act on an issue, which leads to the status quo being
  maintained. This “misperception gap” was especially surprising to the
  researchers given that the UNEA survey group – 191 delegates from 53 countries
  – comprised individuals with a higher level of personal engagement and climate
  expertise overall, including 24 active policy negotiators. Nevertheless, 83%
  of delegates surveyed agreed to some degree that individual members of the
  public have the ability to take meaningful climate action. The findings of the
  study have two main implications, according to the authors. “They indicated a
  disconnect between the policymakers’ perceptions and the views of those on
  whose behalf they act,” said Dr Ximeng Fang, of the Saïd Business School at
  the University of Oxford, the lead author of the study. Dr Stefania Innocenti,
  a co-author, of Oxford’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, said:
  “Policymakers will try to play it safe if they feel they have no public
  mandate … they will try to play it safe and water down bold policy proposals.
  The magnitude of this result is a call for action … if we don’t close this
  gap, we will end up with frustrated ambitions.” Secondly, Fang said,
  policymakers should prioritise talking about climate solutions and how to make
  them reality, instead of wasting time and energy debating their necessity.
  “Net zero is not just feasible but also economically sensible,” Fang said,
  adding that the key was to persuade people by informing them of these
  potential benefits. By constructing climate storylines that centre optimism
  and hope, the authors believe, the “misperception gap” may be closed, thereby
  countering “the impact of news media … with particular ideological
  viewpoints”. Dr Joshua Ettinger, another co-author, of the Center for Climate
  Change Communication at George Mason University, said: “I hope our research
  encourages policy officials to be braver and pursue more ambitious climate
  policies. They have more public support than they may realise.”
