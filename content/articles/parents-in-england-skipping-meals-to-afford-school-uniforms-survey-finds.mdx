  Parents in England are skipping meals and turning to buy-now-pay-later
  services such as Klarna in order to afford school uniforms before the autumn
  term, according to a survey. Almost half (47%) of the 2,000 parents who took
  part in the poll said they were worried about uniform costs, which can run
  into hundreds of pounds due to expensive branded items, while more than a
  quarter (29%) said they had forgone food or heating to pay for uniforms. The
  survey by the parenting charity Parentkind showed struggling parents being
  forced into debt. Nearly half (45%) of those polled planned to use credit
  cards to pay for their children’s school uniform and a third (34%) said they
  would rely on Klarna-style delayed payment services. The education secretary,
  Bridget Phillipson, urged schools to help struggling parents by reducing the
  number of branded items of uniform that pupils are required to wear as a
  matter of urgency, before a forthcoming change in the law. A limit of three
  branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, will be
  enforced from September 2026 after the government’s children’s wellbeing and
  schools bill becomes law, but Phillipson wants schools to act sooner on a
  voluntary basis. “School uniform matters but it shouldn’t break the bank. No
  family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a
  new blazer,” she said. “Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded
  items – and that’s exactly what we’re delivering. Schools can help ease the
  pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they
  require.” Currently, schools can require parents to buy multiple items branded
  with a school logo, often from specialist suppliers, with many asking for more
  than five and in some cases 10 items, pushing total uniform costs up to £400
  including PE kit. Under the new legislation, parents will be able to buy
  cheaper uniform staples such as shirts or trousers from general retailers
  including Aldi and Marks &amp; Spencer. Nearly nine out of 10 parents (86%)
  who took part in the poll – which involved parents of children aged four to 15
  attending state schools in England – felt that wearing branded uniforms made
  no difference to behaviour. Parentkind’s chief executive, Jason Elsom, said:
  “Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for
  far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year,
  covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms
  are the first real step towards ending that injustice. “Limiting branded
  school uniform items will make a difference straight away. Our research shows
  85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and
  add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality.
  This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school
  pride.” Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and
  College Leaders, said: “Many families face wider financial pressures and
  cannot afford basic amenities. The rate of child poverty in the UK is simply
  appalling. We hope to see the government publish a meaningful strategy to
  tackle this issue in the near future.” The government has announced that
  millions of families will receive their benefit payments before the August
  bank holiday this year, with payments originally due on Saturday 23, Sunday 24
  and Monday 25 August paid early on Friday 22 August. The minister for social
  security and disability, Stephen Timms, said: “This is especially important
  ahead of the new school year – no family should have to choose between buying
  school supplies and putting food on the table.”
