  Standing on top of a small mountain, Kim Seung-ho gazes out over an expanse of
  paddy fields glowing in their autumn gold, the ripening grains swaying gently
  in the wind. In the distance, North Korea stretches beyond the horizon. “It’s
  so peaceful,” says the director of the DMZ Ecology Research Institute. “Over
  there, it used to be an artillery range, but since they stopped firing, the
  nature has become so beautiful.” The land before him is the demilitarised
  zone, or DMZ, a strip of land that runs across the Korean peninsula, dividing
  North and South Korea roughly along the 38th parallel north. This heavily
  fortified border was created after the devastating Korean war, which lasted
  from 1950 to 1953. The conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace
  treaty, establishing a buffer zone between the two countries that remain in a
  technical state of war. Stretching 155 miles (250km) across the peninsula and
  2.4 miles wide, the DMZ is anything but demilitarised. It remains one of the
  world’s most heavily fortified borders, strewn with landmines and flanked by
  military installations on both sides. Yet, in the 72 years since the war
  ended, this forbidden strip has become an accidental ecological paradise.
  South Korea’s National Institute of Ecology has documented nearly 6,000
  species here, including more than 100 endangered species – representing more
  than a third of South Korea’s threatened wildlife. The zone’s varied terrain
  creates distinct habitats: the wetlands of the western sector shelter
  migrating cranes, while the rugged eastern mountains provide sanctuary for
  some of the country’s most threatened mammals, including Siberian musk deer
  and Asiatic black bears. Kim and his small team of volunteers, working from
  their research institute in Paju, near the North Korean border, have spent two
  decades documenting this unexpected sanctuary. Each week, come rain or shine,
  they survey the Civilian Control Zone (CCZ), the restricted buffer area
  bordering the DMZ. “In temperate climates worldwide, big cities have
  developed,” he says. “There’s nowhere else where nature has been left alone
  like this.” The DMZ and its surrounding areas, while covering less than 10% of
  South Korea’s total land area, harbour 38% of the country’s endangered species
  and more than 30% of its flora and fauna. This ecological miracle, however,
  comes with a dark twist. “I used to think I was the best environmentalist,”
  Kim says, “but I realised the landmines are doing more for conservation than
  anyone. It’s ironic, no? Weapons meant for killing have become the greatest
  protectors of life.” Kim’s team has meticulously documented every important
  species they encounter, building a detailed database of the region’s wildlife.
  They map each sighting’s location, tracking how species move and habitats
  change over time. Their meticulous documentation has become invaluable. “At
  government meetings, researchers sometimes hesitate to speak when we’re
  present,” Kim says. “They know our data is more comprehensive and accurate
  than official records.” Despite its ecological richness, researching the DMZ
  is fraught with challenges. The zone itself remains off-limits to most
  civilians, heavily guarded and lined with military installations. On its
  southern side lies the CCZ, where access is tightly restricted. Civilians must
  pass through military checkpoints, requiring special clearance from the
  defence ministry and, in certain areas, military escorts. During our drive
  towards one of the few crossing points leading to the DMZ, Kim remarks that we
  are fortunate to have been granted access. “Usually, when relations are this
  strained, civilian access is the first thing to be restricted,” he says.
  Moments later, a phone call from the defence ministry informs us that our
  clearance has been revoked due to sudden military activity at the border.
  “This is the reality we work in,” Kim sighs as we turn back and go to survey a
  nearby non-militarised spot. “One moment we’re planning research; the next,
  the military situation changes, and everything is put on hold.” It is a
  frustrating setback, but one Kim’s team has grown used to. Later, it emerged
  that North Korean military personnel had approached the demarcation line to
  plant explosives, before blowing up the last remaining roads connecting the
  two countries. It is a stark reminder that while hostilities officially ended
  in 1953, the tensions remain very real. These setbacks underscore a more
  profound concern: both war and peace pose a threat to the delicate haven that
  has emerged in the DMZ. Kim fears that any peace agreement could bring
  development, threatening the fragile ecosystem. “The current generation
  shouldn’t decide the DMZ’s fate,” he argues. “We should leave that to a
  generation that values biodiversity. They should choose its future.” When
  tensions rise, Kim takes solace in watching the rare cranes that migrate
  across north-east Asia, resting in the strip for a time before flying on to
  Siberia for the summer. He hopes that conserving these shared natural
  treasures could help bring the two countries together. Looking across the
  restricted zone, Kim reflects on its meaning. “What’s special about the DMZ
  isn’t just its remarkable ecology,” he says, watching the magnificent birds
  circle overhead. “Here, war and peace, life and death coexist. The soil
  contains the remains of soldiers from many nations, yet nature doesn’t
  discriminate by nationality or ideology. It creates a sense of harmony from
  these tragic elements.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow
