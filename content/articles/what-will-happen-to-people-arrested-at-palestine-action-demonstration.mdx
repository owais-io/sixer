  The consequences of being arrested for expressing support for Palestine Action
  could be “life-changing”, one of those detained during Saturday’s protests,
  Jonathon Porritt, has admitted. While the former government adviser said he
  had carefully deliberated over a decision to take part, the road ahead for the
  more than 500 people arrested on Saturday involves possible criminal charges,
  court cases and convictions. Ultimately, custodial sentences of as much as 14
  years could be imposed. What happens next for those arrested? Those whose
  details could be confirmed were released on bail to appear at a police station
  at a future date. The police will send case files to the Crown Prosecution
  Service, as they have done already in the case of at least 26 others who were
  arrested at previous protests in support of Palestine Action. All those
  arrested have now been released under police bail, with the main condition
  being not to attend any future demonstrations aiming to overwhelm the criminal
  justice system in protest at the proscription of Palestine Action by the
  British government. They will be asked how they plead and if it is not guilty
  they can elect for a trial before a magistrate or, more likely, a district
  judge. What courts will be involved? The majority of the 522 people arrested
  in Parliament Square – in most cases after displaying pieces of cardboard
  saying “I opposed genocide, I support Palestine Action” – were detained under
  section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This is the “lower level” part of the
  act, which means those who are charged will be tried in a magistrates court
  rather than a crown court. Some have been charged under the more serious
  section 12, which means they could seek to have their case heard in front of a
  jury of their peers at a crown court. The prosecution could also seek to have
  the trial heard there. Defend Our Juries, the organising group behind the
  protest, has said it will not be recommending what people should do as they
  have already participated “at huge personal cost” but it will be “providing
  the information”. There is a scenario in which court trials do not happen, if
  a co-founder of Palestine Action is successful in a legal challenge against
  the home secretary’s decision to ban the group under anti-terrorism laws. Will
  they be jailed? Given that most of those arrested on Saturday will be
  investigated under section 13 of the terrorism act, they could well walk free
  from court. If convicted they could face a maximum sentence of six months’
  imprisonment or a fine of up to £5,000 or both, while magistrates will take
  into account factors such as good character. More than half of those arrested
  on Saturday were aged 60 or over. Those arrested under section 12 could face a
  maximum sentence of 14 years in prison if convicted. In recent cases under
  section 13, people charged with supporting Hamas, including displaying
  pictures of hang gliders such as those used in the 7 October 2023 attack on
  Israel, were given absolute or conditional discharges. Would a jury be more
  likely to sympathise with those arrested on Saturday? Those involved in
  organising the protest are confident that the British public is on the same
  page as them. What would a terrorism conviction mean for someone? The impact
  of such a conviction would be felt in everything from employment to travel.
  Many of those arrested are retired and while they do not have a job to lose,
  the possibility of being unable to get a visa to go abroad could weigh.
  However, the consequences are starker for others arrested on Saturday
  including health workers and doctors. There was an organised “health block” of
  13 medical professionals – including an obstetrician and gynaecologist, three
  other working doctors, a number of nurses and retired doctors. Alice Clack, a
  senior obstetrician and gynaecologist in the NHS, said: “If doctors are
  charged with a crime, we have to self-report to the GMC [General Medical
  Council], who then have a look at the crime in question and decide whether to
  refer it to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. Then, someone could
  expect to be suspended or they could be erased from the register. That is the
  possibility.” As for seeking future employment, recent legislation largely
  reduced the period of time during which those convicted of most crimes must
  declare a conviction. However, this did not apply to terrorist offences, which
  never become spent.
