  go outside’

  Hernán was at the Latin American restaurant that he owns with his brother in
  the Northwest quadrant of Washington DC last week when his staff started
  getting phone calls and messages about Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (Ice) checkpoints in the neighborhood. The employees, scared that they might
  be targeted and racially profiled, asked if they could go home. Within hours,
  Hernán had to close their doors, and the restaurant hasn’t been open since.
  “Literally after President Trump brought the national guard on DC, everything
  stopped,” said Hernán, who requested his last name not be used due to fears of
  Ice retaliation. “Everything disappeared because the bike delivery guys,
  they’re scared. They’re not on the streets right now. My people, most of my
  cooks are Spanish[-speaking] and they don’t want to go to DC right now.”
  Hernán, who also owns a restaurant in Maryland, said he was hoping to be able
  to reopen in a few weeks if and when the Trump administration’s takeover of
  the DC police ends and immigration enforcement arrests become less frequent.
  But the future is unclear for him and many restaurant owners in the US
  capital. Already suffering from fewer customers due to the administration’s
  almost three-week-long crackdown, restaurants are also having to contend with
  staff shortages because many immigrants, both documented and undocumented,
  fear coming into DC and being on the streets, and some have been detained by
  Ice. Trump has attempted to claim that the crackdown is benefiting
  restaurants. “Half the restaurants closed, because nobody could go, because
  they were afraid to go outside,” he told reporters on Monday about Washington
  before his intervention. “Now those restaurants are opening and new
  restaurants are opening up.” Across the city, the opposite is true. Some
  restaurants, like Hernán’s, have had to close their doors. But more have had
  to make do with fewer workers, fewer delivery drivers and fewer customers.
  “Restaurants will close because you have troops with guns and federal agents
  harassing people … making people afraid to go out,” José Andrés, the
  well-known Washington restaurateur, wrote on social media. Immigrants account
  for 253,000 workers, or 36% of the workforce, in DC’s restaurants, hotels and
  related sectors, according to Migrant Insider, which cited data from FWD.us.
  Included in that total are 42,000 self-employed immigrant entrepreneurs
  running local food and service businesses. Maketto, an Asian restaurant and
  marketplace in north-east DC, posted on social media on Monday that its
  immigrant workers had been affected. “Last week, two of our beloved team
  members were detained while simply walking home from work,” the restaurant
  wrote. “They remain in custody, and our hearts are with them and their
  families.” The restaurant did not respond to a request for comment. Hernán
  said the pause in business was incredibly hard on a small, family-owned
  business, especially after the slow summer months. He’s looking for people who
  live in DC, speak Spanish and English, and are willing to come into work so
  that they can reopen. “But I don’t know if we can find people,” he said. About
  a mile away, near the Columbia Heights neighborhood, a sign in Spanish on the
  door of Elizabeth Pupusería &amp; Deli hung up last week read: “We are closed
  temporarily during the terrible situation in our larger neighborhood. We hope
  to serve you again soon. Let’s take care of ourselves and stay safe in our
  homes.” Elizabeth Rodriguez, a Salvadorian immigrant who owns the restaurant
  and has been in Washington for roughly 20 years, told the Guardian that the
  restaurant was fulfilling some orders that prior customers call in, but its
  doors were not open to the public. “It’s a very ugly thing because the nerves,
  the nerves go up,” Rodriguez said in Spanish about the situation in DC. “The
  clients don’t come for the same reason. Our business relied on construction
  workers because they are the big groups that came to bring various orders for
  all their colleagues. And they haven’t worked all month.” She said she paid
  her workers collectively about $500 a day, and after Trump’s crackdown on 11
  August, she was only bringing in $300 a day. She hasn’t been able to pay any
  of her staff these last two weeks – only she and her daughter-in-law are
  coming in. “We are seeing what we can do so as not to close definitively,” she
  said. “I know that it is only supposed to be one month, but suddenly it is
  very complicated because the rent, the bills, you have to pay them the same.
  “We are asking God for this to change because if we don’t, we can’t pay many
  months of rent,” she added. The restaurant doesn’t typically allow delivery,
  but Rodriguez is thinking about changing that if it reopens because so many
  people don’t want to leave their homes. But even that is difficult, she said.
  “Today I said, ‘Today is the right time to add delivery,’ so I called DoorDash
  and he told me that he doesn’t have workers because most of them have been
  taken and others are afraid to leave.” Ice has reportedly been targeting
  delivery drivers on mopeds, worsening the crisis for restaurants. Several
  videos of Ice detaining delivery drivers have spread across social media, and
  the Washington Post reported, citing anonymous police sources, that Ice is
  accompanying officers with DC’s Metropolitan police department to conduct
  traffic stops of moped drivers to check their immigration status. “You don’t
  want to go outside,” Yonatan Colmenarez, an asylum seeker who came from
  Venezuela two years ago and has driven a moped around DC, told the Post. “It
  gives you a kind of emotional damage; you’re not sure who they might be.”
