  You have finally succumbed and decided to let a canine companion into your
  life – but your search for the perfect pet could put you in the hands of
  fraudsters. Adverts for puppies pop up all the time on pet selling sites,
  online marketplaces and social media. They are not all fake, but in among the
  real Rovers are some faux furry friends. The main scam involves advertising a
  pet that doesn’t exist. You pay the deposit – maybe after a conversation with
  the “seller” or even a video call – and then nothing. You may have been given
  details of a collection point, but if you turn up, you will be disappointed.
  Kate Margolis, from the Cotswolds, England, was scammed when she was looking
  for a golden retriever puppy. “I didn’t know much at the time, so I simply
  Googled ‘golden retriever breeder’ and found what looked like a really
  polished website, full of glowing testimonials, professional-looking photos,
  and even what seemed like credentials and assurances around licensing,” she
  says. “I filled out a form on the site, and the breeder called me almost
  immediately. They sounded knowledgable and walked me through the whole process
  using all the right terminology, which I didn’t understand at the time, but it
  helped build trust. They told me the litter was due at Christmas and the
  puppies would be ready to collect in February, but I’d need to put down a
  deposit to reserve one.” She paid £500 by bank transfer, then the seller went
  quiet. “When I eventually chased them, they told me the puppy I had reserved
  had ‘eaten plastic and died’. After that, they vanished. I was left with no
  puppy, no answers and no refund,” she says. “Since then, I discovered my
  story’s not unusual … scammers create fake listings with stolen puppy photos,
  make up heart-tugging backstories, and use every trick in the book to get you
  to send money fast.” Margolis has since set up an app called Petproov, which
  UK sellers and buyers can use to verify ID and paperwork. What the scam looks
  like The advert appears genuine – there’s a description of the animal and a
  photo. The seller may say that there is only one of a litter of pups left, to
  make you feel like you need to act urgently. You may be supplied with all of
  the answers to your questions, and may even get to “meet” the animal online in
  a video call. When the time to pay comes, you will be asked to do so with a
  bank transfer. What to do Use reputable adoption/rehoming charities and
  breeders – in the UK the Kennel Club has ended its Approved Breeder programme,
  so you will need to do your own research. Ask lots of questions. In the UK,
  the Kennel Club has lots of information about what to ask and what paperwork
  you should be able to see. So does the RSPCA – it says a good breeder should
  be happy to complete a Puppy Contract giving full details of the animal you
  are buying. Check if the photo has been used before. Scammers often steal
  pictures from other websites to use in their adverts, and a reverse image
  search on Google will reveal if your prospective pooch’s portrait has been
  used elsewhere. Arrange to visit the puppy in person and with its mother
  before you commit to anything. Do not be panicked into paying in order to
  secure a visit. “Phrases like ‘Can you pay now to hold the puppy?’ are a
  common red flag,” says Margolis. “Trust your instincts. If something feels
  off, it probably is.” Ask for ID and check it, says Margolis. “A legit breeder
  should be happy to show ID, vet records, and proof that the pup has been
  microchipped,” she says.
