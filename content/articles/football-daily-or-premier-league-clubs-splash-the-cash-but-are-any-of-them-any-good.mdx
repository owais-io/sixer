  MONEY, MONEY, MONEY Over the last few months, Premier League clubs have been
  responsible for roughly £904984bn of spending, an act of such profound,
  altruistic love that even the stadia are in tiers. Nevertheless, the question
  begs: are any of them actually any good? Liverpool won last season’s title
  conceding more goals than every champion since 2013 – issues they are
  understandably keen to address. As such, they have cunningly replaced two
  full-backs who can’t defend with two other full-backs who can’t defend at a
  cost of £59.5m, and so far this season, they’ve conceded four league goals –
  as many as Manchester United, who in that time have been playing without a
  goalkeeper. But of course, blame for the malaise cannot be laid solely at the
  feet of the defenders. Liverpool’s midfield was also a factor in their
  relative permeability, a difficulty they’ve attempted to address by benching a
  more physical, defensively-minded type and bussing £116m on a new attacker to
  take his place; Florian Wirtz’s current contributions stand at 0 goals and 0
  assists. And nor is that it! Arne Slot has also lumped £125m on Alexander Isak
  having already done £79m on Hugo Ekitike in preparation for the inevitability
  of a Bigger Cup knockout-stages undressing. Chelsea, meanwhile, have tossed
  middling money and eternal contracts at every slightly above-average young
  attacker anyone has ever heard of – a strange do given Enzo Maresca’s tactics
  seem to involve reaching the final third, then passing the ball sideways or
  backwards. On the plus side, though, Liam Delap is an absolute demon when it
  comes to cube roots – sure to provide him and them with hours of fun when sat
  in their big coats watching other players fail to achieve cohesion. Arsenal,
  meanwhile, have also spent heavily on attackers, prioritising those unwanted
  by their competitors and with little resale value. Unfortunately for them,
  though, lil Mikel Arteta has lil trousers for a lil reason, and there’s no
  money in the world able to separate him from his beloved timidity: stand by
  for another season of four centre-backs in defence, another in midfield, and
  the glory of a record-breaking fourth second-place on the spin. On to
  Manchester City who, in 2025, have given Pep Guardiola and his epochal genius
  £332.3m to spend, to find themselves below permanent crisis-club, Manchester
  United – and 1,057 others – in the league table. The foremost tactical genius
  of our time does, though, have a plan: a series of gnomic press conferences of
  awkward intensity, some complaints about the unfairness of a system rigged
  against his human rights-abusing overlords, and a request for several hundred
  million more, to be frittered in January. As for Manchester United, they’ve
  attempted to resolve their inability to score goals, last season’s principal
  failing – quite the accolade given the multitude of others – by handing over
  £207.2m for three attackers. Quite how they plan to get any of them the ball
  remains a mystery, given their total lack of a workable midfield, but Ruben
  Amorim remains confident that his 3-4-2-1 system is equipped to solve any
  problem, and will set about addressing this one just as soon as it’s delivered
  world peace. In the meantime, though, United have, at long last, acquired a
  goalkeeper they are confident is a major upgrade on André Onana and Altay
  Bayindir, Senne Lammens being of only average incompetence. When none of this
  solves any of their problems, they will simply sack their manager, appoint
  another, fail to sell the players bought for any kind of value, squander more
  money on more failures, sack the next manager, and so on. Finally, to Villa
  and Newcastle. Only joking, the Daily is, like the rest of the football world,
  in deliberate, sustained conspiracy against their purity of ambition and their
  owners’ purity of motivation. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Our transfer deadline day
  liveblog continues to tick along here, meaning today’s News, Bits and Bobs
