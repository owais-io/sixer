  As the final whistle was blown at Craven Cottage, Benjamin Sesko wiped his
  nose on his shirt and then just stood staring down at the turf in the centre
  circle, while around him the players of Fulham and Manchester United shook
  hands, embraced, or fell to their knees to praise to the almighty deity,
  according to preference. Sesko just carried on staring, then carried on for a
  bit more, seeming not so much disappointed with this energetically vague 1-1
  draw, as consumed by something more basic. How strange to be Sesko right now,
  aged 22 and a few months, a £73m footballer, thrown into the meat grinder and
  asked not just to play and score goals for Manchester United, but to fix them
  too, to work out exactly how this £1bn cut‑and‑shut job of a team, hurled into
  a non‑negotiable shape by a supremely confident man in white trainers, are
  actually going to do this. Score goals. But also invent an attacking rhythm,
  link the parts, discover how we’re meant to play. Because, frankly, no one
  else around here seems to have much of a clue. Craven Cottage had been clammy
  with late summer heat before kick-off, looking as ever like the kind of place
  American movies imagine all English football is played, quaint west London
  terrace houses, chintzy wooden seats, Hugh Grant in a pink shirt. Not to
  mention a mind-numbingly high‑pitched pre-match public address system, the
  kind of thing the CIA might have used to smoke out a 1980s Central American
  dictator from his mansion. If the football was stodgy at first, there was at
  least a sense of something new here as half‑time approached with the game
  still scoreless. For years the talk has been about culture shift around
  Manchester United. And there was a new dynamic here, the question no longer
  whether Manchester United will win the Premier League again, but whether
  Manchester United will ever actually score a goal. Have they ever scored one?
  There is a folk memory of United scoring goals. We have photos, grainy films.
  But is there any hard, unfakeable evidence of this actually happening? Do we
  need to harass Buzz Aldrin again? United did score one here, a deflected own
  goal in the 58th minute, shortly after Sesko had come on. But it wasn’t enough
  to break a sequence that now states no United player has scored against a team
  that hasn’t had its goalkeeper sent off since Bilbao in May. That run reads
  two goals in six games, with four blanks. This can happen. The real issue here
  is that United are overseen by a laughably rigid systems manager, who appears
  to have no actual system for how to attack. What are the patterns, the
  combinations? Manchester United have spent £200m on an entirely new attacking
  tripod. Does anyone really know, on the evidence so far, how it is supposed to
  work? There are options. Overloads, crosses, runs between the lines. Why does
  this look instead like a football version of some extreme cookery TV programme
  where you just throw a handful of rice and some walnuts at a baffled looking
  young man and say: Your mission, Patrick, is to prepare a four-course banquet
  for 5,000 very unhappy people.” Amorim talked afterwards about United
  “creating so many chances” and the absolute certainty they would soon begin to
  score, and you wondered if perhaps he has already spent too much time crouched
  staring with a furious focus into the turf at his feet, like the world’s most
  constipated man poring over the final clue in his cryptic mega-crossword. On
  the other hand, the thing about dogma and systems is they can also be decoded.
  There will be something extra galling for United fans in Marco Silva talking
  after the game about how his players knew the way to get behind United’s
  wingbacks because they basically always do the same thing. The second point is
  that Sesko is just another one in a long line of very young, very talented
  footballers thrown into the fray with no clear blueprint, no sense of
  momentum, nothing but that familiar old sense of dead energy and institutional
  drag. Sesko did his best here. He touched the ball 16 times. He didn’t have
  any shots or dribbles or crosses. There was one lovely little switch of feet.
  Otherwise he was a ghost at the edge of things, tall, rangy, agile,
  impressively tattooed, like an AI depiction of Elite Young Euro Footballer
  2025. Elsewhere, Matheus Cunha had his moments. Bruno Fernandes missed a
  penalty in ludicrous fashion. Fatally distracted by the existence of referee
  Chris Kavanagh, Fernandes didn’t shank or scuff or balloon his kick into the
  stands, he belted it gloriously, a perfect connection. And by the end there
  was a sense at least of some kind of continuity. Manchester United have spent
  a decade as a living breathing confirmation that life is what happens while
  you’re busy making other plans. This remains an endless cycle of what if, of
  hope and regret. United were given a pat on the head by many observers for
  losing 1-0 at home last week. There was talk of “good signs” in the defeat by
  Arsenal, those good signs the fact most of the United team actually looked
  like they wanted to play football. Nobody sat down or gave up. This is the
  starting point now for a rebuild, existentialist ground zero. Is this
  spectacle better then death? If yes, proceed cautiously to the level of doomed
  hope.
