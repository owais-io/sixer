  Tesco has launched a birthday cake sandwich, complete with strawberry jam,
  soft cheese, vanilla frosting and sprinkles – but the candle isn’t included.
  The limited-edition sandwich, between slices of brioche-style white bread,
  contains 31.g of sugar – 35% of an adult’s recommended daily intake – and will
  be on sale for £3 at 1,000 stores for four weeks. Videos of people trying out
  the sandwich have attracted tens of thousands of views on TikTok over the past
  24 hours. Some Tesco customers expressed scepticism on Reddit. “Birthday cake
  is not a flavour,” one said. “It’s not like everyone has the exact same cake
  for their birthday.” Another suggested that creating a birthday cake sandwich
  should be a criminal offence. “The Earl of Sandwich did not intend this to
  happen,” one Reddit user wrote. “Bet he’s rolling in his grave.” The fourth
  Earl of Sandwich is said to have invented the sandwich in 1762 when he asked
  for a serving of roast beef to be placed between two slices of bread so that
  he did not have to leave the table where he was playing cards. Tesco said the
  “soiree sandwich” was being released to mark the 30th anniversary of the
  Clubcard. TikTok users have suggested it reminds them of a jam sandwich. “It
  tastes like that, but with a bit of cream,” one said. “If you love a jam
  sandwich, it’s literally that – but elevated,” said another. “This is way
  better than I thought it would be.” It follows the release in June by Marks
  &amp; Spencer of a strawberry and cream sandwich, nicknamed the “strawberry
  sando”. Inspired by the craze for Japanese fruit sandos, the M&amp;S version
  went viral on social media, and the sandwich chain Subway then released its
  own version. Nutritional information for Tesco’s sandwich shows that it
  contains 515 calories with 8.4g saturated fat – 42% of an adult’s recommended
  daily intake. Despite being a “dessert sandwich”, it can be part of the Tesco
  meal deal for £4, alongside a drink and snack. Tesco’s brand manager, Violaine
  Barthe, said: “With 3.1million sandwiches sold in Tesco each week, sandwiches
  make up a big proportion of Clubcard purchases and so there was only one way
  to celebrate Clubcard turning 30. “The birthday cake sandwich is a celebration
  not to be missed and we can’t wait to hear the nation’s feedback.” Review:
  ‘This is an abomination’ I love birthday cake. I cannot get enough invitations
  to afternoon tea and I am even quite fond of a jam sandwich. But this is an
  abomination. At first glance, squashed against the plastic packaging, the
  sandwich looks like it is covered in specks of mould. On closer inspection, I
  realise these are blue sprinkles – they glisten slightly amid the fat of the
  soft cheese. There is a sickly sounding swishing noise as I bite into the
  bread. The sweetness of the jam tastes so odd combined with the gloopy cheese
  and cloys to my tongue, so that I continue to taste it long after I have
  swallowed. While the bread is reminiscent of brioche, it also tastes like –
  and resembles – the white bread I would expect to find in a packaged Tesco
  sandwich, especially the crust. With each bite, I am expecting to taste a
  savoury meal. Instead, I am confronted with a dessert. It reminds me of sickly
  homemade desserts I have forced myself to eat out of politeness. I wouldn’t
  even buy this to celebrate my worst enemy’s birthday. • This article was
  amended on 6 August 2025. Owing to incorrect information provided in a press
  release, an earlier version said Tesco sells 3.1 million sandwiches a year; in
  fact, this is weekly sandwich sales.
