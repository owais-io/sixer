  Day by day, the death toll rises, the war crimes mount, and the outrage grows.
  Last Wednesday, the pope demanded that Israel stop its “collective punishment”
  of Gaza’s population. A day later, António Guterres, the United Nations
  secretary general, warned that “the levels of death and destruction … are
  without parallel in recent times”. More than 500 UN staff have pressed the
  human rights chief, Volker Türk, to call it genocide. Half of registered
  voters in the US have already concluded that that is what Israel is doing in
  Gaza. The agony is deepening. On Friday, the Israeli military declared
  famine-hit Gaza City to be a combat zone, intensifying its assault and ending
  “tactical pauses” that allowed limited – if utterly inadequate – food
  delivery. Many inhabitants are physically incapable of fleeing again, and fear
  that they would be no safer elsewhere. Israel has attacked parts of areas that
  it has labelled as “humanitarian zones”. Israel could end the international
  condemnation by stopping its campaign of annihilation. Instead, it tries to
  stop us learning about it, by silencing those who bear witness. It is
  determined to control the narrative of the war – though even its own figures
  at times offer a bleak view of conditions – and will go to shocking lengths.
  This has become the most lethal war for the media in recent history. According
  to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 189 Palestinian
  journalists are dead in Gaza; others put the toll still higher. Five were
  killed in a single strike last week. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and
  Avaaz, a non-profit organisation promoting global activism, are calling on
  Israel to abide by its international obligations to protect journalists as
  civilians, and open Gaza’s borders so that international journalists can
  report freely. The Guardian is printing the names of all of those whom the CPJ
  has listed as killed: women and men such as Fatma Hassona, Hamza al-Dahdouh
  and Anas al-Sharif, admired for their work and, of course, dearly loved as
  daughters, fathers, sisters and friends. These are deeply personal losses. But
  they also represent a generation of journalists that is being wiped out and
  cannot be replaced. “At the rate journalists are being killed in Gaza by the
  Israeli army, there will soon be no one left to keep you informed,” warned
  Thibaut Bruttin, RSF’s director general. The civilian death toll in Gaza is
  staggering, and journalists are put at particular risk when they run to danger
  to report as others try to escape. But the killing of so many who have been
  clearly identified as members of the media, in some cases after they were
  threatened over their work or smeared, leaves no doubt that they have been
  targeted. This is “the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and
  silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented”, the organisation has said.
  “Palestinian journalists are being threatened, directly targeted and murdered
  by Israeli forces, and are arbitrarily detained and tortured in retaliation
  for their work.” Journalists in Gaza work in unbearable conditions – hungry
  and exhausted, breaking off reporting to find food for their families, help
  carry bodies from rubble or assist wounded relatives in finding shelter. Many
  are separated from those they love; many have buried loved ones. All know that
  in bearing witness, they increase the danger that they face. They carry on to
  defend the truth against Israel’s attempts to extinguish it. They must be
  defended themselves. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
