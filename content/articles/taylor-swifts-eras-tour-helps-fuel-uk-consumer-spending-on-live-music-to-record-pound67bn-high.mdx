  UK consumer spending on live music events reached a record-breaking total of
  £6.68bn in 2024, up 9.5% on the previous year, fuelled in part by Taylor
  Swift’s blockbuster Eras tour. The report from Live (Live music Industry
  Venues and Entertainment), the recently formed body advocating for the British
  music industry’s interests before government, signals a full-bodied return
  from the effects of Covid-19. The figures are 28.2% higher than in 2022, when
  live music more or less resumed after the pandemic, and more than £2bn more
  than in 2019, the last fully functioning year for live music prior to the
  shutdown. But with grassroots venues across the UK still closing down at an
  increasing rate – one in four late-night venues, including clubs, have closed
  since 2020, with closures accelerating this year – and emerging artists
  struggling to make a living, the report noted that stadiums and arenas were
  the major beneficiaries of the increase, thanks to high-profile gigs by the
  likes of Swift, Dua Lipa and Charli xcx. Live analysed 55,000 gigs, concerts,
  festivals and events, and found that mainstream pop gigs accounted for 32.1%
  of consumer spend across the top 2,000 concerts of the year, a year-on-year
  increase of 4.7 percentage points. It flagged that the grassroots crisis
  extends beyond venues and artists to include promoters and festivals. Live
  music expenditure also remained heavily concentrated in the capital, with
  London accounting for 28.9% of all 2024 outlay, although Manchester
  experienced a bump thanks to the opening of the new Co-op Live arena. The UK’s
  festivals and concerts attracted more than 23.5 million music tourists in
  2024. Concerts took a 75.3% share of live music spending, up almost two
  percentage points since 2023. The smaller share for festivals reflects the
  difficulties faced by that sector amid high-cost inflation – and the challenge
  to compete with major single-day concerts by the likes of Swift and Bruce
  Springsteen that force consumers to make decisions over how to prioritise
  their budget for live music. Live backed the widespread industry
  recommendation that the government should introduce tax relief to enable
  festivals to survive. “There is a clear role for government, given that its
  stewardship of the economy will determine our trading environment and audience
  confidence,” said Live chief executive Jon Collins. The live music sector
  employed more than 234,000 people in the UK in 2024, a 2.2% year-on-year
  increase – albeit one with low job security: 78.8% of these workers are casual
  or freelance. Short-notice cancellation of events put these fragile
  livelihoods at risk: 48% of respondents reported having jobs cancelled at less
  than a week’s notice. Live was established in 2024 to support the work of the
  Music Venue Trust and to help develop a funding programme in which arena and
  stadium shows with a capacity of more than 5,000 could voluntarily add a £1
  levy to ticket prices, creating a fund to support grassroots music venues. In
  July, the Royal Albert Hall in London became the first arena to commit to the
  programme. “With trustees now appointed and commitments already secured from a
  number of high-profile artists performing stadium and arena shows throughout
  2025 and 2026 the Live Trust is confident it can soon begin offering financial
  support where it is needed,” the report said. It defines its mission to
  “empower” the UK music industry as one of kickstarting economic growth,
  breaking down barriers to opportunity, making the industry safer – targeting
  worker precarity, harassment and terrorist attempts on live music events – and
  focusing on environmental sustainability.
