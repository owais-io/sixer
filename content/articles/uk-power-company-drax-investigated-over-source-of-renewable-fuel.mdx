  The power generator Drax has revealed it is under investigation by the City
  watchdog over “historical statements” made about the sourcing of wood pellets
  for its biomass power station. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed
  the investigation on Thursday, which will cover a period of more than two
  years between January 2022 to March 2024, and examine whether the company
  complied with disclosure and transparency rules, including in three annual
  reports. Drax said on Thursday that the FCA investigation related to “certain
  historical statements regarding the company’s biomass sourcing and the
  compliance of Drax’s 2021, 2022 and 2023 annual reports with the listing rules
  and disclosure guidance and transparency rules. The company will cooperate
  with the FCA as part of their investigation.” The regulator said: “We can
  confirm that the FCA has opened an investigation into Drax Group.” The news
  sent Drax shares down by 10% in early trading on Thursday. It comes months
  after Drax’s former head of public affairs and policy Rowaa Ahmar accused Drax
  of having made misleading claims over its sourcing of wood for biomass
  pellets, which were made as part of her claim for unfair dismissal at an
  employment tribunal. Drax denied her claims, and reached a settlement with
  Ahmar a week after the case opened. Drax was last year found to have supplied
  inaccurate data for previous government subsidies, leading to a £25m fine.
  Drax is expected to receive more than £10bn in renewable energy subsidies
  between 2012 and 2027, the current regime period, according to the thinktank
  Ember. The UK government confirmed earlier this year that it would continue
  offering new subsidies for Drax’s wood-burning power plant in Yorkshire after
  the existing subsidy ends in 2027.
