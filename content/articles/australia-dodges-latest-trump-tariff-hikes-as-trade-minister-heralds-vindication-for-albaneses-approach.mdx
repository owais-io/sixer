  Australian goods imported into the US will continue to attract the baseline
  10% tariff, with Australia dodging any tariff increase in the latest round of
  Donald Trump’s global trade war. On Thursday night US time – Friday morning in
  Australia – Trump issued an executive order confirming new tariff deals for
  several trading partners, as well as revised tariffs for a number of other
  countries. Australia is not mentioned in the order, which stated that any
  countries not on the new list would remain at a 10% tariff. Guardian Australia
  understands the US government confirmed to the Australian embassy in
  Washington DC that the 10% tariff rate would remain in place. “The White House
  has confirmed that no country has reciprocal tariffs lower than Australia,” a
  spokesperson for Australia’s minister for trade, Don Farrell, said on Friday
  morning. Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs” are separate to the
  industry-specific tariffs of 50% imposed by the Trump administration on
  Australian steel, aluminium and copper imports: those tariffs also remain in
  place. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “While we remain in the best possible
  position under the United States’ new tariff regime, we will continue to
  advocate for the removal of all tariffs in line with our free trade
  agreement,” the spokesperson said. Farrell said the US commerce secretary –
  and tariff hawk – Howard Lutnick, had told him there had been pressure from
  within the US administration for an increase on Australia’s tariff rate “but
  that President Trump had decided to maintain that 10%”. “I think this is a
  vindication for the Albanese government – and particularly the prime minister
  – and the cool and calm way we have conducted diplomacy with the United
  States.” Australia runs a trade deficit with the US, but Farrell said imposing
  reciprocal tariffs on US goods, as a retributive measure for the US tariffs,
  would have been counterproductive. Farrell said that Australia holding at 10%
  – while the tariffs imposed on other countries had increased – was a
  comparative win for Australia. “Australian products are now more competitive
  into the American market … products like wine, beef, lamb, wheat are, in a
  relative sense, cheaper into the United States.” Farrell said Australia still
  hoped to remove all tariffs from its imports into America, and he had invited
  Lutnick to Australia for further talks. “We believe in free and fair trade,
  and we will continue to put the argument to the US that they should remove all
  tariffs on Australian products in accordance with our free trade agreement,
  and we will continue to prosecute that argument.” Quizzed on whether the
  multibillion-dollar Aukus submarine deal had been a factor in the trade tariff
  negotiations, Farrell said Australia’s close defence relationship with the US
  was separate from its trade links. “We will continue to have discussions with
  the US about the Aukus: it will be completely independent of our trade
  relationship. There is no job that is more important for a federal government
  than our national security.” The Biden-era Aukus deal, under which Australia
  would buy nuclear submarines from the US, is currently being reviewed by the
  Pentagon, under instruction from Trump. A Commonwealth Bank of Australia
  report issued Friday said Australia was relatively “well-insulated” from the
  turbulence caused by the Trump tariffs. “We estimate Australian GDP will be
  just 0.3% lower over a few years because of the tariffs. Only around 5% of
  Australia’s exports are to the US. And Australia’s tariff rate is a relatively
  low 10%.” In the executive order issued this week, Trump indicated he was open
  to further negotiations on tariffs with countries he saw as aligned to his
  America First ideology. “Some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the
  verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the
  United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy
  the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in
  Executive Order 14257, and to align with the United States on economic and
  national security matters.” Executive Order 14257 was Trump’s April order,
  which argued that “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits
  constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and
  economy of the United States”. Trump’s latest executive order castigated
  unnamed countries he felt had shown insufficient fealty to the US on trade.
  “Other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered
  terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our
  trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United
  States on economic and national-security matters,” the order read. “There are
  also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the
  United States or to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United
  States on economic and national security matters.” The new executive order
  punishes small economies in particular, who have limited trading relationships
  with the US: Syria was given a 41% tariff rate, Myanmar and Laos 40%. The EU
  has a split tariff rate: 0% on some goods, and 15% on others. China, one of
  the US’s largest trading partners and a target of Trump’s trade ire, is not
  mentioned in the latest order. It remains at a 30% tariff rate, with some
  exemptions for goods such as smartphones and semiconductors. A proposed –
  punitive – 145% tariff on Chinese imports has been paused until mid-August.
  The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told reporters the US has the
  “makings of a deal” with China, but that it’s not yet complete. “There’s still
  a few technical details to be worked out on the Chinese side between us. I’m
  confident that it will be done, but it’s not 100% done.” With tariff
  negotiations still in play, Trump has taken aim at countries that negotiate
  with American drug companies to pay lower prices for pharmaceuticals, such as
  Australia. Under Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the government
  negotiates directly with drug companies to secure comparatively low prices, a
  longstanding arrangement, but one which has been a consistent irritant for
  Trump. Australia has been consistent in its dealings with the Trump
  administration that “the PBS is not up for negotiation”. “Our government is
  getting on with the job of delivering cheaper medicines for Australians,” a
  government spokesperson said.
