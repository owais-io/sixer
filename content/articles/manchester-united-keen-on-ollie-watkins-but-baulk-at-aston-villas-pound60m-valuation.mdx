  Manchester United are interested in signing Ollie Watkins but are unwilling to
  meet Aston Villa’s valuation of the striker. Arsenal made numerous bids for
  the England international in January but were knocked back as Villa held out
  for £60m, a fee they would demand for any sale this summer. Ruben Amorim has
  been seeking a new striker given the struggles of both Rasmus Højlund and
  Joshua Zirzkee last season. Another option is RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.
  Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson is no longer part of the thinking at Old Trafford.
  Aston Villa insist Watkins is not for sale and are in a position of strength
  as his contract runs until 2028, meaning it would take an extremely high offer
  for them to consider parting ways. It would also be difficult for the club to
  find a replacement with the new season a little more than a fortnight away.
  United value Watkins at between £40m and £45m, which is similar to what
  Arsenal were offering in January. Sesko is seven years Watkins’ junior,
  arguably making him a better long-term prospect. But Leipzig are thought to
  want almost £80m for the Slovenian, who scored 13 goals in the Bundesliga last
  season. Sesko is thought to also be a target for Newcastle as they face
  uncertainty over Alexander Isak’s future. United have already spent in excess
  of £130m on signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer and focus will
  turn to offloading some of their unwanted players. Marcus Rashford’s wages
  have been taken off the books after he joined Barcelona on loan but Antony,
  Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia remain. If United want to
  acquire a new striker, bringing in fees from the sales of these four will be
  imperative. The club, meanwhile, have made a key appointment, hiring Mike
  Sansoni as head of data, replacing Dominic Jordan who left last year. Sansoni
  arrives from Mercedes Formula One team, of which Sir Jim Ratcliffe owns a
  third, where spent 11 years, mostly working as a senior performance engineer.
  He will be responsible for “transforming the club’s capabilities in data and
  artificial intelligence”. Furthermore, Kirstin Furber will arrive as director
  of people in the autumn from Channel 4.
