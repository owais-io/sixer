  Summer in Bury St Edmunds has little in common with San Sebastián, even if
  both certainly entice food-lovers. A few months ago, however, Suffolk’s food
  capital welcomed a soupçon of fancy-pants Spain in the form of Bellota on
  Churchgate Street, not far from the abbey. Bellota bills itself as offering an
  “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only
  a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking
  married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work. On its
  website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I
  severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s
  657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However,
  on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a
  rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the
  door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that
  doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan
  joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff
  working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats,
  no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting,
  “Oui, chef!” Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour,
  and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us
  taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute
  hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread
  throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t
  already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d
  paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a
  satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.
  Bellota’s genesis has been financed by Linda Keenan, who has connections to
  London’s well-loved Noble Rot and the Clove Club, and, although dissecting
  something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters.
  Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked
  away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely
  beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering. From the first snacks
  of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain
  – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red
  pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a
  heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much
  as a hint of naivety. A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with
  sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece
  of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare
  slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick
  of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and
  replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The
  chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing,
  no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just
  fabulous food. How very modern indeed. Bellota opened three months ago, and
  without much fanfare. Curious locals turned up, word of mouth spread, then
  people began travelling from around Suffolk, followed by the down-from-London
  brigade, me included. Twelve or so short weeks later, Bury St Edmunds’
  residents – or the ones I met in the local shops, anyway – are now lamenting
  that they hadn’t booked sooner, and in the forlorn tones that are usually
  reserved for the likes of Noma’s summer season tables. After eating at
  Bellota, I now feel bad for them, too, because this small, almost perfect
  joint will most likely win a Michelin star very soon, and then it’ll be bonne
  chance for anyone wanting to try Gabi’s Thai green curry ice-cream with warm
  pistachio cake and confit apricots. Yes, you read that right: I did say Thai
  green curry ice-cream. And, yes, it works. Don’t try this at home, people. In
  fact, all the sweet things here are done wonderfully, including the
  tantalising pre-dessert of monte enebro goat’s cheese with candied walnuts and
  glossy membrillo sorbet; rumour tells me there’s sometimes sourdough
  ice-cream, too. There are also some very good petits four, including
  immaculate black olive bonbons with a sweet tapenade filling. Yes to all of
  this, and to one of my top five openings of 2025. Bellota, 43-45A Churchgate
  Street, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, 01702 844890. Open lunch Fri &amp; Sat only,
  12.30pm sitting; dinner Weds &amp; Thurs 7pm; dinner Fri &amp; Sat 5.30pm and
  8pm. Seven-course tasting menu £75, eight-course menu £85, both plus drinks.
