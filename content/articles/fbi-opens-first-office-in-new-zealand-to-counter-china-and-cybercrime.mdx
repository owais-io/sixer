  The director of the FBI, Kash Patel, has opened the bureau’s first ever office
  in New Zealand, in what he said was an attempt to help counter China’s
  activities in the Indo-Pacific, crack down on issues including cybercrime, and
  strengthen protection of the Five Eyes nations. Patel, who opened the office
  at the US embassy in Wellington on Thursday, called the event an “historic
  moment”. “The announcement that we are opening up our law enforcement attache
  office here in Wellington shows the world that the FBI is actually
  prioritising a permanent presence across all Five Eyes countries,” Patel said
  in a video, supplied by the embassy. “Here in New Zealand we had not had that
  until this historic moment, so we are truly humbled with the reception we have
  been given.” Patel said the US and New Zealand would work together on “some of
  the most important global issues of our time”. “Countering the CCP in the
  Indopacom [the US’s Indo-Pacific Command] area, countering the narcotics
  trade, working against cyber intrusion and ransomware operations and most
  importantly protecting our respective citizenry,” he said. The FBI has
  stationed staff in Wellington since 2017, as a sub-office of the legal attaché
  office in Australia’s capital Canberra, Australia. The new office will have
  responsibility for partnerships in New Zealand, Antarctica, Samoa, Niue, Cook
  Islands, and Tonga. Patel – a Donald Trump ally, who has made headlines in
  recent weeks over the Epstein controversy - is the most senior member of the
  US administration to visit New Zealand since the start of Trump’s second term
  in office. During his visit, he met with senior government representatives,
  including the ministers and heads responsible for the country’s police,
  foreign affairs and spy agencies. The minister responsible for New Zealand’s
  intelligence services, Judith Collins said she and Patel had “exchanged a
  range of insights” on areas such as trans-national organised crime,
  counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and espionage. Police minister Mark Mitchell
  said Patel’s visit should “send a clear message to criminals” that they
  “cannot hide behind an international border”. “New Zealand police are
  continually working with their overseas counterparts like the FBI to catch
  those engaged in illegal, harmful activities such as drug smuggling and online
  child exploitation, as well disrupting and preventing this offending from
  happening in the first place,” he said in a statement.
