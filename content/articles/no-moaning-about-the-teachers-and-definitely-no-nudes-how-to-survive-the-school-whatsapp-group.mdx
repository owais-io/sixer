  Becoming a parent can be one of the richest, most rewarding things you can
  ever experience. That said, it’s a qualified reward, because to be a parent is
  often to be forced into joining the school WhatsApp group. In theory, it’s a
  community of like-minded peers who understand that it takes a village to raise
  a child. In reality, the school WhatsApp group is a vortex of petty drama,
  pointless competition and outright hostility. Navigating a mess like this can
  often leave a parent feeling bruised and overwhelmed. It is a task that
  requires diplomacy, patience and – sometimes, because everyone’s human –
  locking your phone away in a drawer until your blood pressure recovers. With
  that in mind, using real-life stories collected from friends and
  acquaintances, here are the top 10 rules of school WhatsApp group engagement.
  The group is not Google If there’s a gap in your understanding when it comes
  to the machinations of your child’s school – maybe you want to know when the
  next non-uniform day or bake sale is – always check your email first. Answer
  not there? Have a look on the school website. Once you’ve done that, then (and
  only then) ask the group. Because to ask the group anything is to receive an
  answer from everyone. Do you really want to receive 28 messages reading “Next
  Friday x”, and another two saying “Don’t know hun”? More importantly, do you
  want to be the person responsible for ensuring that everyone else in the group
  suddenly receives 30 unsolicited messages? No, you do not, because you are not
  a psychopath. The only thing worse than treating the group like Google, from
  my research, is passive-aggressively responding to these messages with
  screenshots from the school website. If you do that, I can guarantee that
  there’s a breakout group devoted to slagging you off. But we’ll come to that.
  No external ideologies A successful group is one that remains on-message. To
  invite any other subject into the conversation is to plunge the whole
  endeavour into chaos. Proof? See the friend of mine who forwarded me several
  long and impassioned screenshots from a group member who was desperately
  trying to get everyone else to care about the local council’s plans for a
  roundabout. Another sent a message from a parent who kept asking everyone to
  sign a petition to deport migrants. My favourite story of this ilk, however,
  is as follows: “We have one mum lecturing us not to use sun cream on our kids
  because of ‘chemicals’. She says that sunburn is just the skin shedding
  toxins.” Yikes. Be the same person in the group as you are at the gates This
  is a general rule for all WhatsApp groups. However, in a school setting –
  where many parents don’t know each other particularly well – it seems to be
  exacerbated. The rule is this: if you’re nice to someone in the group and then
  see them in real life, also be nice. Don’t, as seems to be the case in several
  schools, act like everyone’s best friend online and then blank them at the
  gates. This is the fastest way to foster hostility. Actually, no, the second
  fastest. Don’t let the chat spill out into real life It isn’t unheard of for
  conflict that started on WhatsApp to reach its conclusion at the school gates.
  One friend told me about a squabble that had erupted on WhatsApp, with one
  parent accusing another of dinging their car on the school run. “It kicked off
  the next morning with a full-on fight that had to be split up by one of the
  teachers,” she said. Another told me about a case of bullying at school that
  ended up with one dad offering to lay out the other child’s dad in the
  playground the following morning. This works both ways; sometimes a real-life
  dispute can leak into the chat, which only serves to amplify the drama. “One
  mum said in the playground that if she’d had a ginger-haired child, she would
  kill it,” said a friend. “Another parent heard her and reported it to the
  school. Now the mum who said it is kicking off on WhatsApp and calling
  everyone twats.” Beware the breakout group On paper, a breakout group seems
  sensible to keep the peace – if you’re feeling aggrieved, you have a place to
  vent in confidence to a smaller group. But in practice this never works,
  thanks to the overwhelming likelihood that you’ll end up accidentally sending
  something contentious to the main group. I was sent a screenshot of a long and
  admittedly quite boring message from a dad that was instantly followed by a
  mum describing him as a “moaning douche”. This was then followed by a panicked
  “Haha, sorry, I meant to send that to my mum.” Someone else mentioned an
  escalating passive-aggressive feud on WhatsApp that culminated in one of them
  accidentally posting a mocking picture of the other’s Facebook page to the
  main group. “It sent everyone silent,” my friend said. “Collective intake of
  group chat breath. She exited the group shortly afterwards.” Be grateful
  you’re not Dutch This may not be what anyone wants to hear, especially if
  their phone is buzzing with 30 “Happy birthday” messages directed at a
  six-year-old who isn’t even on WhatsApp, but we apparently have it relatively
  easy. A Dutch friend recently spent a few years in the UK. To my incredulity,
  she claims she actually enjoyed the WhatsApp experience here. “We were
  overjoyed at the low level of parent participation in the school system,” she
  told me. “In Holland, all the groups have zero hierarchy, and everyone needs
  to be heard and taken seriously. I participated in a group about sex
  education, in which our discussions had to result in educational goals that we
  could all agree on. The group included me, a gay father and a few very strict
  Muslim mothers. The only thing we could agree on was the phrase ‘homosexuality
  exists’.” The teachers know everything you’re saying It’s a big mistake to
  assume that what happens in the group stays in the group. A handful of
  teachers got in touch, describing all the times group threads had made their
  way back to them. One told me of an incident where a mum had accused her of
  violating her daughter’s human rights for not letting her play in part of a
  classroom that hadn’t been tidied yet. Another said that when a male teacher
  left the school, word quickly (and falsely) spread that it was because he was
  a paedophile. A third said that after her pupils read a book about a child
  with two fathers, such a long and angry fight ensued on WhatsApp that she was
  forced to intervene by meeting everyone at the school gates wearing a rainbow
  lanyard. Be very, very, very careful with your nudes When I asked people for
  their worst school WhatsApp stories, I wasn’t expecting to receive any
  responses about nudity. Silly me. On the least terrifying end of the spectrum,
  a friend told me that: “One of the dads sent everyone a picture of what looked
  like a half-naked woman, but we were all too panicked and British to say
  anything.” More drastically, from someone else: “During Covid, a mum sent a
  nude picture to the entire class WhatsApp group. She was clearly having an
  affair. She quickly deleted it, but not before several screenshots were
  taken.” And from a different person: “I woke up one day to a closeup pic of a
  mum’s genitals. Her story was that her phone was stolen and the person sent it
  to the group, but I’m pretty sure her husband caught her in an affair and did
  it out of rage.” Don’t forget the legal repercussions WhatsApp groups can
  become so toxic that schools have begun to intervene, hiring lawyers to write
  rules dictating parents’ conduct in the chat, and making it clear that
  personal and abusive comments about staff and pupils will not be tolerated.
  And this year the law got involved. In January, six Hertfordshire police
  officers were sent to arrest Maxie Allen and his partner Rosalind Levine for
  messages they wrote on their school WhatsApp group. Although they weren’t
  charged, they were investigated for harassment and malicious communications.
  According to the school, the messages sent were inflammatory, defamatory and
  concerned their daughter’s new headteacher. So really, it’s probably just
  safer to stick to vagina pics. And finally: no flouncing off Regrettably, I
  must draw on my own experience here. Compared with many of the horror stories
  I received, the WhatsApp group of my children’s school was actually quite
  tame. There were no fistfights or anti-vax propaganda, and almost definitely
  no unsolicited nudes. However, it was incessant, and I am apparently too
  short‑tempered for that. For the few weeks that I was a member, my phone would
  buzz at three-second intervals day and night with people asking if anyone had
  seen their kid’s jumper or when PE was. And one day something snapped. I had
  put my phone on airplane mode while I did an important interview for work.
  When I switched it back on, it started madly buzzing in my hand. In less than
  an hour, the group had messaged each other about 70 times. So I left. This was
  my big mistake. Officially, only the group admins are informed when a member
  leaves. Unofficially, what happens next is that the admins then tell everyone
  else that the only dad in the group has flounced off like a diva. My point
  here is this: if you’re ever going to have a furious Elton John-style meltdown
  in front of people, it’s really important that they aren’t people who you’re
  going to have to see twice a day for the next seven years.
