  Alan Davies: Think Ahead review – comedian addresses his childhood abuse in
  return to stage
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  It’s been 10 years since Alan Davies’s last standup show, since when, he says,
  he has had a third child, and surpassed – by distressing margins – the ages of
  lance corporal Jones in Dad’s Army and “the mad old git in Back to the
  Future”. Another significant development was his 2020 book revealing the story
  of his childhood sexual abuse by his father. In his new show, Think Ahead,
  Davies addresses that on stage – and demonstrates, with reference to his
  laboured breathing, that he is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder
  while doing so. That can’t be anything other than a compelling stage moment,
  to see a “people-pleasing comedian” (his words) of 30 years’ standing open up
  – and so rawly – about a difficult subject unaddressed in his comedy until
  now. Davies does so with honesty and a lightness of touch. He acknowledges
  that it’s an awkward topic for mirth, and makes good choices about when to set
  the jokes aside and when to find the funny. The funny? This was a dad who made
  colour copies of his child sexual abuse images on the household printer (“How
  many trips to Rymans?!”) and whose diary, when unearthed by Davies years
  later, focused exclusively on golf. Davies’s abuse is not the main focus of
  Think Ahead, far from it, and the remainder delivers one big-laughs set-piece
  after another. There is material about his youngest son, now nine, and some
  choice ranting in Alf Garnett-alike character as a man apoplectic about Ulez.
  There’s also plenty of blue humour, of a type that couldn’t fail to tickle a
  crowd, but which Davies elevates with his vivid image-making – of the sexual
  position you should adopt in the event of Viagra-induced heart attack, say, or
  of his experience delivering a poo sample for cancer screening. How do these
  very disparate routines fit together? You could argue that the childhood abuse
  material is dissonant with the broad sex comedy elsewhere. It also underpins
  it somehow, offsetting with shade the light of Davies’s default
  people-pleasing superficiality, making the laughs wilder because they are
  harder won. The upshot is a striking new show, a cross-section of the
  59-year-old’s life now that reveals parts his previous shows couldn’t reach. •
  At Orchard at Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 10 August. Then touring from 19
  September. • All our Edinburgh festival reviews. • The NSPCC offers support to
  children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.
