  Household electricity bills have increased by 10% since Donald Trump
  re-entered the White House, a new report has found, with its authors
  highlighting the impact of the president’s datacenter boosterism and cuts to
  clean energy projects as part of the cause. The analysis comes as the US
  energy secretary, Chris Wright, said he knows rising energy prices could be a
  political challenge for the GOP ahead of next year’s midterm elections, but
  claimed Democrats were to blame for the cost increases. “The momentum of the
  Obama-Biden policies, for sure that destruction is going to continue in the
  coming years,” he told Politico in an interview published on Tuesday. “That
  momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it?
  We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.” Trump has repeatedly
  promised to lower utility bills. And in his Politico interview, Wright
  insisted that the Trump administration’s war on renewable energy is not
  inflating electricity costs. But studies have found that Trump’s pro-fossil
  fuel, anti-renewable energy policies will raise prices. A July report from
  climate thinktank Energy Innovation, for instance, found that the Republicans’
  spending megabill that the president signed last month could increase
  wholesale electricity prices by as much as 74%, largely due to its repeal of
  many Biden-era green energy incentives. According to the new report from
  advocacy group Climate Power, which is based on an analysis of data from the
  US Energy Information Administration, those price increases are already
  beginning to take hold. “Republicans are fueling an energy crisis and
  inflicting a massive utility bill hike on Americans across the country,” said
  Climate Power senior adviser Jesse Lee. “This is nothing short of a betrayal
  of their own voters. Families are losing jobs while their bills climb, all
  because Republicans would rather protect their donors than lower costs.”
  Reached for comment, Department of Energy spokesperson Ben Dietderich said:
  “While radical activist groups might still be trying to peddle nonsense, the
  American people elected President Trump to restore commonsense energy policies
  and that is exactly what we are doing,” adding that in 2024, the US obtained
  82% of its energy from hydrocarbons and only 3% from renewable energy. “Other
  than higher energy prices and a less reliable grid more prone to blackouts,
  there is very little to show for the previous administration’s reckless green
  new scam spending that cost hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said. The
  average price of household energy increased by roughly 10% from 15.95 cents
  per kWh in January 2025 to 17.47 cents per kWh in May 2025, Climate Power
  found. Household gas prices have risen by a stunning 56% over the same period.
  Electricity prices were 6% higher in May 2025 than in the same month of last
  year, while gas prices rose by 8% over the same period. Some regions have seen
  even higher spikes in cost. In New Jersey, rates skyrocketed by 20% in June.
  Among the reasons for the increase are Trump’s new tariffs, as well as his
  undercutting of inexpensive renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.
  Rising energy demand driven by datacenters for artificial intelligence – which
  Trump has promoted – also play a role, the report says, as do rising
  temperatures amid the climate crisis, to which federal officials are
  contributing with their deregulatory policies. More recent anti-environmental
  moves from the administration threaten to further increase prices, Climate
  Power says. Last week, for instance, the treasury department released a
  rewrite of decades-old standards for how renewable energy projects can qualify
  for cost-cutting credits, potentially threatening the viability of many clean
  energy developments. Although the president promised to spur job growth, those
  policies are also reducing employment, the new report found: since his
  election, 64,000 jobs in renewable energy sectors have already been cut or
  paused. “Companies have canceled, delayed or laid off staff at 123 energy
  projects in 33 states, representing over $33.87bn in lost investment,” the
  report says, adding that the gutting will also continue to increase utility
  prices. “Families are losing jobs while their bills climb, all because
  Republicans would rather protect their donors than lower costs,” said Lee.
  “This report details just how badly this bill is hurting Americans – and we’re
  going to make sure they know who to blame when they open higher utility bills
  this month.”
