  Hardly a day goes by without a new insult being hurled in the faces of asylum
  seekers and refugees. We’re scroungers, rapists, fighting-age men who
  shouldn’t have left our home countries. Sometimes we’re simply “illegals”, the
  most dehumanising term of all. When did it become a crime to run for your
  life? The people levelling these accusations are superb at making themselves
  heard. Mud sticks – and most of us are too scared to try to set the record
  straight. I don’t know how many of our accusers have sat down with us, human
  to human, and listened to our stories. Here’s mine. I grew up in Syria. My
  childhood was safe and happy – idyllic when I look back at it. In 2011, the
  Arab spring and civil war in Syria changed everything. I was imprisoned twice
  for protesting against the Assad regime, but it never crossed my mind to
  leave. Like many young people, I never thought death would come for me.
  Everything changed when I was almost killed in a deadly missile attack in a
  suburb of Aleppo I was only 17, and I realised that I wanted to live. So I
  escaped. First to Turkey, and then I travelled through Europe until I reached
  Calais. I hoped to reach the UK for two reasons. First, my auntie and cousins
  live here. After my mum died when I was 14, my auntie became a second mum to
  me. Second, I could speak English. The thing people don’t understand about
  refugees is how tired we are from what we have been through. All I could think
  about was resting and being with my auntie. I spent 10 months in Calais trying
  to get to Britain. It was before small boat crossings become the main method
  of getting here, but the smugglers were there. We all hated them because they
  made it more difficult for us to cross the Channel without them. I tried every
  way I could: lorries, cargo trains, sneaking into the port to try to conceal
  myself on a ferry. At that time the French police were attacking migrants, as
  they do now. Sometimes they would be helpful and tell us things such as what
  time border guards changed shift – that was the best time to try to sneak on
  to a train or a lorry. Sometimes we were wished good luck by French and
  British border force and police; some saw us as humans, some saw us as
  criminals. When I made it to the UK in 2017, I thought I had finally found
  safety, but my experience with the Home Office reminded me that I hadn’t. I
  always felt as if I was being treated like a criminal. I was required to
  report to a police station regularly, and it took more than two years to get a
  decision on my asylum case. Government aside, in that period British society
  was generally more welcoming towards people such as me. I could walk down the
  street in one of the UK’s diverse cities and blend in. I met wonderful people
  who always made me feel as if I belonged. Everything changed when the previous
  government introduced the now-cancelled Rwanda scheme. People were put in
  detention centres and threatened with deportation. Although I had been granted
  leave to remain by then, I was really scared that the government would come
  after me too and deport me. That fear has grown even more since the Home
  Office changed its policy this February: people like me who entered
  irregularly will now “normally be refused citizenship”. One of the nightmares
  I often have is of shouting for help in the middle of the street when no one
  can hear me. I now feel I am living that dream. Now that I have lived in the
  UK for a few years, I understand the politics better. People just want someone
  to blame for the state of the economy and public services – and migrants and
  refugees are the easiest to blame. Some believe the lies about us. I work as a
  cinematographer and also volunteer with a charity as an Arabic interpreter. I
  speak to a lot of age-disputed young people who the Home Office insists are
  adults and have been placed in adult hotels. It is so obvious when I listen to
  them speak that they are children. They cry down the phone to me. They hate
  being in hotels, forced to share rooms with adults they don’t know. Most
  refugees dream of returning home if it becomes safe to do so. I often think
  back to the secure time of my childhood. I grew up with the scents of jasmine
  and geranium in my garden. I have planted those things here to try to recreate
  a sense of home. No matter what I do here to contribute, I feel I will always
  be viewed as a criminal and someone at risk of being sent back to my country,
  however unsafe it is. Open, explicit racism seems to be on the rise in
  Britain. It starts with refugees like me and other migrants – but they will
  soon come for other people simply because they are not white, or belong to the
  “wrong” religion, or their sexual orientation. Unless we act now, things are
  going to get worse. As told to Diane Taylor Ayman Alhussein is a Syrian
  film-maker based in London Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
