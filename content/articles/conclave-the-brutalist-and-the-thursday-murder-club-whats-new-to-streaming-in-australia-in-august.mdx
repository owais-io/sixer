  Netflix Australia The Thursday Murder Club TV, US, 2025 – out 28 August Like
  Only Murders in the Building and A Man on the Inside, Netflix’s new murder
  mystery series (adapted from the bestselling Richard Osman novel) belongs to a
  suite of storylines involving ageing folk investigating crimes – at their own
  ambling speed, with some afternoon tea of course, maybe a nap or two. Set
  inside a retirement village where a group of residents meet every Thursday to
  investigate cold cases, the plot swings into gear when an actual murder
  occurs, putting their novice sleuthing to the test. The director is Hollywood
  veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs Doubtfire, the first two Harry Potter
  movies) and the cast is pretty stacked – including Helen Mirren as a former
  spy, Ben Kingsley as a former psychiatrist and Pierce Brosnan as a former
  union man. The Brutalist Film, 2024, US – out 30 August (also on Binge) There
  are many reasons not to miss Brady Corbet’s epic 40s and 50s-set period drama
  about a Hungarian architect and Holocaust survivor (Adrien Brody’s László
  Tóth) who emigrates to the so-called land of the free to start again. When
  Tóth arrives, Corbet deploys the film’s centrepiece image: the State of
  Liberty upside down, suggesting his journey might not be a carefree lark. The
  film has a peculiar and enigmatic energy; it moves and shifts in strange ways.
  All the cast are great, including Brody (who won an Oscar for the role) and
  Guy Pearce, who plays a rich industrialist who recognises Tóth’s brilliance.
  Long Story Short TV, US, 2025 – out 22 August I love Netflix’s animated adult
  series BoJack Horseman, one time even voting it the second-best TV show of the
  century. So a new series from its creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg was always
  going to be a must-watch for me. Long Story Short uses a time-jumping
  narrative to follow a Jewish family from northern California: in the first
  episode, for instance, we meet several characters as kids, and in the next
  they’re much older, with children of their own. Bob-Waksberg has described it
  as “visually more grounded than BoJack”, with a “comic strip” sensibility.
  Honourable mentions: Wednesday season 2 part 1 (TV, 6 August), The Iron Claw
  (film, 10 August), Fixed (film, 13 August), Night Always Comes (film, 15
  August), The Echoes of Survivors: Inside Korea’s Tragedies (TV, 15 August),
  Hostage (TV, 21 August), The Beekeeper (film, 23 August). Stan In Vitro Film,
  Australia, 2024 – out 24 August Strange things are afoot on an Australian
  cattle farm in this suspenseful, atmospherically on-edge film that’s part
  relationship drama, part sci-fi, set in a not-too-distant future where the
  climate crisis has had a horrible impact on the agricultural industry. Married
  couple Layla (Talia Zucker) and Jack (Ashley Zukerman) are sheep farmers; one
  of them is hiding a dramatic secret. In Vitro maintains, as I wrote in my
  review, a “spare approach, building anticipation for an interestingly peculiar
  final act”. The Assassin TV, UK/Germany/Australia, 2025 – out now “The
  Assassin” is one of those terribly generic titles that suggest an utter lack
  of imagination. They really couldn’t think of anything better? Thankfully, the
  early buzz around this new series from creators Harry and Jack Williams (who
  helmed the explosively entertaining The Tourist) is very good. Keeley Hawes
  leads the cast as the titular assassin, who’s living on a Greek island when
  she’s asked to do One More Job – just as her estranged son (Freddie Highmore)
  comes to visit. In her review, the Guardian’s Lucy Mangan said “a menopausal
  assassin has been a long time coming”, and called the show “perfectly crafted
  preposterousness” that’s “stylish, witty, [and] tightly written”. Cosmopolis
  Film, Canada/France, 2012 – out 3 August Most of David Cronenberg’s
  intoxicatingly surreal head trip is based in and around the limousine of
  28-year-old billionaire Eric Packer (Pattinson), which he uses as a penthouse
  and travelling office. From the safety of this vehicular cocoon, which slowly
  moves through congested New York streets, Packer is informed about threats to
  the president, threats to himself and the economy, the movements of protesters
  and other things that imply a volatile world outside. Cronenberg (adapting Don
  DeLillo’s novel of the same name) makes circumspect commentary on wealth
  disparity and the grotesqueries of late-stage capitalism. Honourable mentions:
  Bran Nue Dae (film, out 5 August), A Silence (film, 5 August), Let Me In
  (film, 6 August), Outlander: Blood of My Blood (TV, 9 August), The Iron Claw
  (film, 10 August), I Know What You Did Last Summer (film, 15 August), I Still
  Know What You Did Last Summer (film, 16 August), The Rainmaker season 1 (TV,
  16 August), The Beekeeper (film, 23 August), The Daughter (film, 27 August),
  The Rover (film, 31 August). SBS on Demand The Eight Mountains Film,
  Italy/Belgium/France, 2022 – out 1 August Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte
  Vandermeersch’s very handsomely staged drama contemplates big themes –
  fatherhood and lifelong friendships – via the story of thirtysomething men and
  former childhood pals Pietro (Luca Marinelli) and Bruno (Alessandro Borghi),
  who reunite after many years apart. It certainly has a grand setting: the
  Italian Alps, where amazing mountains loom in the background in an almost
  spiritual way, as if the characters are being watched by ancient forces.
  Despite a big, heavy heart, it’s an accessible and crowd-pleasing film, told
  with a gentle ebb and flow. The Prestige Film, UK/US, 2006 – out 15 August I
  love how Christopher Nolan’s great movie about feuding magicians is itself a
  bit of a magic trick, with lots of spectacle and some cunning narrative
  sleight of hand – including a ripping twist associated with Christian Bale’s
  character. He plays Alfred Borden, arch nemesis of Robert “The Great Danton”
  Angier (Hugh Jackman), who cannot work out how Borden performs his signature
  trick, the “Transported Man”. Angier’s desperation leads him to consult Nikola
  Tesla (David Bowie), who provides him with a mysterious contraption that sends
  him, and the narrative, into another stratosphere. Honourable mentions:
  Unforgiven (film, 1 August), Death in Brunswick (film, 1 August), Midnight
  Special (film, 4 August), Body Melt (film, 4 August), Alphaville (film, 4
  August), The Man Who Fell to Earth (film, 4 August), Absolute Power (film, 6
  August), Syriana (film, 8 August), Marcella seasons 1-3 (TV, 9 August),
  Leonardo da Vinci (TV, 9 August), Little Fires Everywhere (TV, 16 August),
  Safe Harbor (TV, 21 August), Aguirre: The Wrath of God (film, 22 August),
  Fatal Crossing (TV, 28 August). ABC iView The Family Next Door TV, Australia,
  2025 – out 10 August This new series from director Emma Freeman is the first
  ever mystery-drama to be set in an Australian coastal community. Boom-tish!
  The opposite of course is true: it feels as though we get new additions to
  this genre every other week. Not all star the excellent Teresa Palmer, however
  (though one recently did). She plays Isabelle, an “enigmatic stranger” – to
  quote the official synopsis – who’s central to “a mystery that disrupts the
  seemingly harmonious beachside community of Pleasant Court”. Yeah, we’ve been
  here before, but I’ll watch anything from Freeman, whose oeuvre includes
  Stateless, Love Me, Fake and The Newsreader. Honourable mentions: Professor T
  season 1 (TV, 15 August), Stories From Magic Beach (TV, 15 August), In the
  Heights (film, 22 August), I, Jack Wright (TV, 24 August), Killer Whale:
  Australia’s Megapod (TV, 26 August). Amazon Prime Video Conclave Film, UK/US,
  2024 – out 9 August Edward Berger’s film about the highly secretive process of
  electing a new pope was exactly what I was hoping for: a tight, taut,
  thriller-ish production with a cloak-and-dagger feel. Ralph Fiennes headlines
  as Cardinal Lawrence, who’s in charge of the electoral process, which involves
  a large number of cardinals choosing a successor from among various factions
  and ideological persuasions, from progressive and reformist to staunchly
  conservative. It’s loaded with juicy twists and turns. Top End Wedding Film,
  Australia, 2019 – out 11 August The screenplay of Wayne Blair’s romantic
  comedy is a bit of a dog’s breakfast, awkwardly balancing comedy and drama –
  though there’s still lots to appreciate, including laugh-out-loud jokes and
  Miranda Tapsell’s charming lead performance. She plays Lauren, a lawyer who
  searches for her missing mother in the lead-up to her wedding. As I wrote in
  my review: “The Tiwi Islands provide a wonderful location and stories
  involving Indigenous Australians marrying non-Indigenous people have won
  little consideration in Australian cinema’s 120-odd-year existence.” A TV
  sequel to the film, Top End Bub, arrives on Prime Video next month. Honourable
  mentions: Lord of the Flies (film, 1 August), Licorice Pizza (film, 1 August),
  The Wolf of Wall Street (film, 4 August), The Pickup (film, 6 August),
  Butterfly (TV, 13 August), John Wick (film, 20 August), The Terminal List:
  Dark Wolf (TV, 27 August). Max Final Destination: Bloodlines Film, US, 2025 –
  out now I’m a big fan of the Final Destination franchise. The writing can be a
  bit shonky and the performances not exactly Oscar-worthy, but the core premise
  – that people who escape their fates are tracked down and killed by Death
  himself – leads to some unique and perversely creative set-pieces, in which
  characters are killed off by a combination of elements around them. Bloodlines
  – the sixth Final Destination movie, and the first in 14 years – takes a
  playful approach, increasing the stakes and giving its protagonist Stefani
  (Kaitlyn Santa Juana) an ability to “see him coming”. Him being Death.
  Honourable mentions: I’m Alan Partridge season 1 and 2 (TV, 1 August), The
  Hobbit 1-3 (film, 2 August), The Yoghurt Shop Murders (TV, 4 August), Dead Hot
  (TV, 18 August), Peacemaker season 2 (TV, 22 August), Alma’s Not Normal
  seasons 1-2 (TV, 25 August). Binge Wolf Man Film, US, 2025 – out 9 August
  Leigh Whannell’s remake of 1941’s excellent monster movie The Wolf Man didn’t
  get a good rap from critics, but I reckon it’s hugely underrated: a sad and
  deeply contemplative film about the fear of being a bad parent, and the horror
  of realising you’re part of the problem. These emotions are experienced by
  Blake (Christopher Abbott), who returns to his childhood home in rural Oregon
  with his daughter (Matilda Firth) and wife (Julia Garner) after learning that
  his father has died. He gets bitten by a werewolf and slowly transforms into
  one, while trying to protect his little girl from another ravenous beast
  stomping around outside. Honourable mentions: The Good Doctor seasons 1-7 (TV,
  1 August), Emmanuelle (film, 2 August), The Twelve: Cape Rock Killer (TV, 4
  August), Gladiator 2 (film, 8 August), The Lord of the Rings 1-3 (film, 9
  August), The Brutalist (film, 30 August), The Lost Tiger (film, 30 August).
  Disney+ King of the Hill season 14 TV, US, 2025 – out 4 August The previous
  season of Mike Judge’s classic animated sitcom aired 15 years ago, and I think
  it’s fair to say a few things in the world have happened since then. Texan
  protagonist Hank Hill (Judge) would almost certainly vote Trump; ditto for his
  redneck pals, maybe even his wife, Peggy, (Kathy Najimy). One of the great
  things about the show is how genuine, how real the characters feel, and how
  much you care for them despite their many inadequacies and prejudices. The
  14th season jumps forward in time, ageing the characters by about eight years,
  though certain things remain the same: Hank of course still sells propane and
  propane accessories. How will he respond to an ever-changing world,
  contemplating contemporary initiatives such as all-gendered bathrooms? Not
  well, I’m guessing. Honourable mentions: Eyes of Wakanda (TV, 1 August),
  Planes, Trains and Automobiles (film, 1 August), Leap of Faith (film, 1
  August), Reservation Dogs seasons 1-3 (TV, 6 August), Alien: Earth (TV, 13
  August), The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox (TV, 20 August), Eenie Meanie (film,
  22 August). Apple TV+ Chief of War TV, US, 2025 – out now Jason Momoa’s hands
  are all over this epic period drama set in 18th and 19th century Hawaii. In
  addition to starring in the lead role as real-life warrior chief Kaʻiana, he
  co-created the series, executive produced it and directed the season finale.
  According to the official synopsis, the story begins “when the four major
  kingdoms of the Hawaiian Islands were in a state of war” and follows the
  protagonist as he “joins a bloody campaign” then “rebels against the
  unification of Hawaiʻi that took place from 1782 to 1810”. The Guardian’s Phil
  Harrison described it as a show that’s “steeped in Polynesian cultural
  practices” but also “full of universal, action-adventure staples”. Honourable
  mentions: Stillwater season 4 (TV, 1 August), Platonic season 2 (TV, 6
  August), Invasion season 3 (TV, 22 August).
