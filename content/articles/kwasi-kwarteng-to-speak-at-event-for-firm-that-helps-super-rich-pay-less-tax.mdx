  Kwasi Kwarteng, the former chancellor dismissed after 38 days following his
  disastrous 2022 mini-budget for Liz Truss, has been hired as a keynote speaker
  by an advisory firm offering services to help the super-rich pay less tax.
  Nomad Capitalist, which bills itself as the “masters of international
  mobility”, lists the second shortest-serving postwar incumbent of 11 Downing
  Street as one of the star attractions at its annual conference, which will
  take place in September in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A promotional video for the
  event, which promises to share with delegates “actionable strategies on taxes,
  second citizenships, asset protection and global investments”, opens with the
  words: “It’s a really powerful experience to come together for an event like
  this all in the name of freedom.” Other speakers include Steve Wozniak, the
  co-founder of Apple, and the investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald. When
  approached by the Guardian, Kwarteng said: “I’m just giving a talk there. I
  have nothing else to say,” before adding: “I’m not an MP, I’m not an office
  holder, I’m a private citizen and I’ve been asked to speak at this thing. Make
  of it what you will.” The former chancellor would not reveal how much he was
  charging to appear in Malaysia. The event includes a programme of speakers and
  networking functions during a four-day gathering marketed as “the world’s
  number one event for global citizens”. He said: “It’s a classic kind of
  Guardian thing [to report on]. Multimillionaires, libertarians all that kind
  of stuff. It is just a private thing, someone asked me to do it and I’m doing
  it.” When the Reform UK party leader, Nigel Farage, spoke at last year’s Nomad
  Capitalist conference, he declared to parliament that he had earned £40,075
  for the 10-hour job. The event programme states that Kwarteng will be talking
  about “the impact of global political decisions on international business and
  investment”. His 2022 tax-cutting mini-budget was widely criticised for
  triggering a financial crisis that led to emergency bond purchases by the Bank
  of England; it also hit the pockets of ordinary people. The group’s
  promotional material says: “When millionaires, digital celebrities, and
  successful founders seek to lower their taxes and create an international Plan
  B, they turn to the masters of international mobility – Nomad Capitalist. “We
  specialise in legally and ethically reducing your tax rate, diversifying and
  safeguarding your assets, growing your passport portfolio, and maximizing
  freedom.” A spokesperson for Nomad Capitalist said: “We can confirm that Kwasi
  Kwarteng is scheduled to speak at Nomad Capitalist Live 2025 in Kuala Lumpur
  this September. As with all our speakers, Mr Kwarteng has been invited to
  share his insights on global economic trends and the future of international
  mobility. “Nomad Capitalist Live brings together a diverse group of leaders,
  entrepreneurs, and professionals to discuss legal, ethical strategies for
  global citizenship, tax efficiency, and asset protection. The event is
  designed to explore ideas around freedom, mobility, and global investment –
  not to promote any one political agenda.”
