  How do you follow that? Mohammed Siraj is still on the mind, bowling, always
  bowling, programmed to wobble it in at off‑stump until the collapse of
  civilisation. Anyone who witnessed Chris Woakes, scrapping for singles with
  his slinged‑up arm, merits a week off to head to the sauna, play the vinyls,
  whatever gets you to decompress. But this is the English cricketing summer,
  refusing to give you a minute, packed beyond comprehension. A day after the
  conclusion of the Test summer, it was time to start the Hundred north of the
  river with the capital double-header: London Spirit against Oval Invincibles.
  This is a stopgap season, the final year before new team owners – including
  four Indian Premier League franchises – enter with their own ideas of how to
  make this thing sing. For now, it is the same old tricks: fireworks in the
  daylight to kick off the new tournament and the awkwardness of the pop-up DJ
  booth, trying its best to convince those in: cricket is cool, cricket is cool,
  please kids believe me, cricket is cool. Away from the gimmicks, there is
  quality. The Spirit women are the defending champions, with their opponents
  two-time winners. It was only right that the first ball of the new edition was
  bowled by the Invincibles’ Marizanne Kapp, the South Africa all‑rounder who
  has excelled in every season, orchestrating their final victories on this
  ground. She bowled 10 on the trot and hooped the last of those into Georgia
  Redmayne to celebrate the first wicket. From there it was a game of Australian
  power. Grace Harris starred in Surrey’s victory in the Blast last month but is
  calling Lord’s home at the moment. She was brutal against the leggies of
  Amanda‑Jade Wellington, her compatriot, smashing 89 off 42 balls as the Spirit
  finished on 176 for five, the second-highest total in the women’s Hundred.
  Cordelia Griffith, whose previous four seasons in the competition had returned
  a high score of 30 not out, finally had the glory of a half-century. Then came
  the Invincibles’ Meg Lanning, the former Australia captain playing against the
  side she represented last year. There was scratchiness in her start, 24 off
  her first 27 deliveries, costly in a chase requiring immediate impact. But
  then the strokes flowed. With 47 required off 14 balls, Lanning unleashed on
  Eva Gray, 20 taken off the next four deliveries, the cut shot a reminder of
  her days as a giant of the international game. A riveting finish was on until
  Issy Wong intervened, Lanning restricted to 85, the Spirit victors by 17 runs.
  During the break between games, members of the “Tech Titans” consortium, the
  incoming co-owners of the Spirit, surveyed the view from the media centre,
  taking in what they have signed up for. The start by the women’s side would
  have pleased them and there must have been some excitement when Spirit’s men
  walked out to bat. Kane Williamson is their new captain, David Warner is
  present at the top of the order. The pair no longer reign over the IPL – they
  won it together at Sunrisers Hyderabad nine years ago – but the Hundred will
  take star names where it can. The runs, though, will have to wait another day.
  Both departed for single-figure scores against the Invincibles, who have won
  the past two men’s competitions. In fact, the two‑figure score was a rarity as
  the Spirit crumbled, bowled out for just 80 as Rashid Khan and Sam Curran
  shared six wickets. The former’s twirl is a new addition to the Invincibles, a
  significant flex to call upon the leading wicket-taker in T20 cricket as you
  chase three in a row. The lowly target meant there was little thrill under the
  lights, a thoroughly anti‑climactic conclusion awaiting all; the England and
  Wales Cricket Board announced an attendance of 26,013 for the men’s game. The
  crowd’s greatest pleasure came from witnessing a fox do a lap of the ground
  early in the chase. Liam Dawson finding some turn to bowl Tawanda Muyeye did
  not muster as much excitement. The Invincibles crawled on what was not the
  easiest surface, yet still got the win with a six down the ground, 31 balls
  left in the match. But, then again, how do you follow that?
