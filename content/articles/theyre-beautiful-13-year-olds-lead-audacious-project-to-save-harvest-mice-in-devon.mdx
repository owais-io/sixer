  Doing somersaults in the corner of a field in Devon this week were the fluffy
  results of an audacious wildlife project by two 13-year-old girls. Best
  friends Eva Wishart and Emily Smith had become devoted to harvest mice, and
  were upset, a couple of years ago, to find out the species is threatened in
  England due to farming practices and habitat loss. The two girls took matters
  into their own hands and decided to replenish local harvest mice stocks
  themselves. In the two years since, they have bred dozens of the tiny rodents
  in their garages and on Wednesday they released 250 of them into a nature
  reserve near Wishart’s home. Harvest mice are Britain’s smallest rodent, at
  just 70 millimetres long, with sandy fur that helps them to blend into the
  grasses in which they nest. The mice are an important prey species for larger
  animals, and a major predator of insects that can be agricultural pests.
  Harvest mice are the only mammals in Britain to have a prehensile tail, which
  means they can grasp or hold objects such as grass stalks. They were once
  ubiquitous in autumn as they made their nests in the grasses that sprang up
  after harvest. But for the last few years, their numbers have been reducing
  under threat from modern farming practices as farmers now spray pesticides,
  crop the same field multiple times a year and using combine harvesters, all
  that are thought to have decimated the population. Wishart and Smith, the two
  young naturalists, raised the mice in 27 tanks in their homes, with some
  sourced from a tip by Smith’s mother. Honeysuckle and hazel, plants the mice
  love to climb, were harvested from Wishart’s garden to place in the tanks. As
  harvest mice are native to the UK there are no licences required to breed and
  release them into the wild. The pair managed to finance the project, including
  buying the mice and commissioning the enclosure, with £4,000 crowdfunded from
  the public. They reached their goal after a boost from the well-known nature
  presenter Chris Packham, who shared it with his millions of nature-loving
  social media followers. The release itself had been carefully planned: Wishart
  and Smith enlisted the help of a carpenter, who built a soft release enclosure
  with tiny holes so the mice could come and go but snakes and rats would be
  kept out, giving them a safe place to hide from predators. Surveying her mice
  as they crept into the wild, Wishart said: “I love them – they’re my little
  babies. I’m really proud of them going into the big wide world. They are
  beautiful.” Smith was more melancholy: “I am going to miss the responsibility.
  It’s nice to have them, but it’s good that they’re going to do their part in
  the ecosystem.” Packham came along to support the release. “We are in the
  midst of a biodiversity crisis,” he said. “I am very pleased when I see
  practical projects like these, particularly when they are done by young
  people.” The pair lament that their peers are not as interested in bringing
  back nature as they are, although friends came along to support them for the
  release. The time commitment to raise the mice is small, Wishart said: “It’s
  not that much, it’s something that everyone could plausibly do. I’m sure they
  spend more time on TikTok – it only takes 10 minutes a day. The average screen
  time of people in our year at school is 10 hours.” Wishart’s first foray into
  mice husbandry almost ended in disaster: “I was given four mice by ecologist
  Derek Gow, but we kept them in enclosures outside and the neighbour’s cat ate
  three of them. We saved the fourth, which was pregnant and had some pups. And
  then Derek forgave me and gave me some more mice.” They will survey the area
  for mouse nests next September, to see if they have bred, and plan to get some
  more mice from Gow in the spring to supplement the numbers. Projects are going
  on across the country to save the harvest mouse, with some released in Ealing
  in 2024 and Cheshire between 2002 and 2004. The Mammal Society runs the
  National Harvest Mouse Survey, a nest survey by volunteers to find out more
  about the status of the mouse on the British Isles. For her next project, the
  dauntless Wishart hopes to release common lizards into the nature reserve. “If
  I get my lizard project off the ground we will release them here because it’s
  going to be a nature reserve and lizards are great,” she said. “I would like
  more people in my generation to have the chance to do things like this.”
