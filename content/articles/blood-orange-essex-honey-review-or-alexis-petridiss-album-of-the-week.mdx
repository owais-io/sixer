  Dev Hynes’s fifth studio album as Blood Orange opens with a series of
  unexpected musical juxtapositions. The first track, Look at You, starts out
  with softly sung vocals over a cushion of equally soft synthesiser chords,
  before stopping dead, then re-emerging as almost an entirely different song:
  harmonies over guitar chords strummed so slowly you can hear the plectrum
  hitting each individual string. The second, Thinking Clean, offers a piano
  over pattering hi-hats: there’s something anticipatory about it, like an intro
  that’s about to burst into life, but when it does – complete with dancefloor
  rhythm – the song swiftly falls apart. The piano becomes increasingly
  abstract, before everything gives way to scrabbling, apparently improvised
  cello. It’s a lot to cram into six minutes, but anyone familiar with Blood
  Orange’s back catalogue might reasonably ask: what did you expect? Since he
  adopted the name, Hynes’s career has occasionally intersected with the
  mainstream, although never in a straightforward way. His biggest track,
  Champagne Coast, was belatedly hoisted to platinum status by a burst of TikTok
  virality, 14 years after release. As a producer and songwriter, his name has
  appeared in the credits of albums by major pop artists including Mariah Carey
  and Kylie Minogue, but never as a dependable hit-maker, more a signal that
  said artist is craving a hint of left-field cool. His albums exist in their
  own world, filled with unexpected musical jump-cuts, their variety indicated
  by the featured artists: Skepta and Debbie Harry, Nelly Furtado next to Yves
  Tumour, A$AP Rocky alongside Arca. The results, while admirably eclectic,
  could often be too scattered for their own good. But Essex Honey feels like a
  noticeably different animal to its predecessors. The eclecticism is present
  and correct. This is an album on which a song called The Train (King’s Cross),
  which closely resembles old-fashioned Sarah Records indie pop, exists
  alongside one called Life, which with its snail’s pace funk, wah-wah guitar,
  falsetto vocals and bursts of sickly woodwind sounds not unlike something
  Prince might have made in the wee small hours. So, too, are those musical
  jump-cuts. Cæcilie Trier’s cello appears regularly, usually as tracks end,
  playing stuff that doesn’t sound interstitial so much as disruptive. There are
  moments when sounds suddenly emerge then vanish just as quickly, oddly
  disconnected to anything around them: a burst of keyboards before Somewhere in
  Between gets under way, a piano line in between Mind Loaded and Vivid Light
  that sounds as if it’s fallen off the breakdown of an old hardcore rave tune.
  And yet, in marked contrast to previous Blood Orange albums, all the
  constituent elements are held together by tone and a sense of place. Its
  primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy:
  there’s a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the sounds here – soft but warm
  synthesisers, electric piano and harmony vocals – and a chilly morning
  crispness about the undistorted electric guitar. The melodies are frequently
  gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by the death of Hynes’s mother, the
  lyrics evoke both Greater London’s urban sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I
  hold dear,” he sings on The Last of England – and its more pastoral
  surroundings, the latter a relief from “the broken light” of the city on
  Countryside. It’s also an album on which memories provide a brief respite from
  looming tragedy. “Regressing back to times you know / Playing songs you forgot
  you owned,” Hynes sings on Westerberg, a song that duly borrows its chorus
  from the Replacements’ 1987 single Alex Chilton. Elsewhere, there are
  interpolations of tracks by Yo La Tengo and Everything But the Girl’s Ben
  Watt: an extraordinarily lovely sample from 1998’s Sing to Me earns the
  Durutti Column a credit on The Field. The other guests are the usual eclectic
  array – Caroline Polachek, Turnstile frontman Brendan Yates, Sudanese-Canadian
  singer-songwriter Mustafa, Guatemalan art-pop auteur Mabe Fratti among them –
  but they seldom feel like attention-grabbing star turns. There’s a
  heartbreaking moment when Lorde’s voice soars out during Mind Loaded, singing
  the phrase “everything means nothing to me” – an interpolation of the Elliott
  Smith song of the same name – and an impressively witty one during Vivid
  Light, when a line about writer’s block is delivered by novelist Zadie Smith.
  But for the most part, the guests stay in the background, out of the
  spotlight. They’re there in service to the songs and an atmosphere that
  continues to haunt you long after Essex Honey ends: grief marshalling a unique
  talent into music that’s desperately sad, but beautiful, a particularly
  resonant broadcast from Blood Orange’s irregular world. This week Alexis
  listened to Deftones – I Think About You All the Time An early standout from
  Private Music: the Deftones’ shoegaze-y side turned up to 10, a heaving,
  emotive chorus.
