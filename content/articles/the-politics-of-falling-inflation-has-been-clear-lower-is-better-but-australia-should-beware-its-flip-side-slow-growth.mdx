  Australia should beware its flip side: slow growth

  There is much to like in the latest inflation figures, which dropped to 2.1%
  in the year to June – and even to 1.9%, if you believe the less reliable
  monthly version. We have certainly come a long way in the two-and-a-half years
  since inflation reached nearly 8%. The most obvious takeaway is that the
  Reserve Bank board will surely cut the cash rate on 12 August. Michele
  Bullock, the central bank’s governor, had previously made it clear that the
  holdouts on the monetary policy board were waiting for more comfort that
  inflation was tracking as expected. They have that now. Notably, the central
  bank’s preferred “underlying” inflation rate also eased, from 2.9% to 2.7%.
  That measure excludes volatile movements in the price of things such as
  petrol, fruit and vegetables and electricity, and it is in line with where the
  RBA’s economists thought it would be. So, really, there’s no convincing
  argument to not cut rates (besides its impact on a rapidly reheating housing
  market). Sign up: AU Breaking News email Economists agree. Stephen Smith, a
  partner at Deloitte Access Economics, said that interest rates were acting as
  a brake on the economy, and that this was “hard to justify given ongoing
  global economic volatility and the continued sluggishness of our own domestic
  economy”. After making high inflation public enemy number one during Labor’s
  first term of government, it was no wonder Jim Chalmers hailed the ABS’s
  latest consumer price report as “stunning” and “absolutely outstanding”. The
  upcoming economic reform roundtable is occupying much of the treasurer’s
  attention, so of course he would prefer not to be forced into fighting a rear
  guard action against yesterday’s villain. But another is looming on the
  horizon. The politics and economics of falling inflation has been clear: lower
  is better. It is worth remembering, however, the other side to low inflation,
  which is slow growth. The Australian economy expanded by just 0.2% through the
  first three months of this year, while annual growth stalled at 1.3%.
  Households are wary of opening their wallets, which has dragged on consumption
  in 2025. Growth in government spending, which propped up activity in 2024, is
  waning. So does that make an inflation rate of just 2% unalloyed good news, or
  a bit of a worry? “Clearly, our economy is not growing as quickly as we would
  like,” Chalmers acknowledged during a doorstop in parliament house. “We are
  attentive to those cyclical issues [such as] weaker growth, getting on top of
  inflation,” Chalmers said. “But we’re also increasingly focused on the bigger
  structural issues – productivity growth in our economy, the intergenerational
  challenge.” As much as he would like to focus on the future, the last thing we
  need as a country is to get mired in the low-growth, low-inflation, low-wage
  world that preceded the pandemic. The economic implications of disinflation
  may be changing, and the political implications with it.
