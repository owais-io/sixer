  “Is this government going to put the nail in the coffin of the joy of digging
  ground for potatoes on a cold, wet February Sunday afternoon?” Jeremy Corbyn
  wrote in the Daily Telegraph (Jeremy Corbyn warns rules on council asset sales
  threaten allotments, 5 August). Never trust a man who can’t tell his parsnips
  from his potatoes: leaving spuds in the ground till February means they’ll
  have been spoiled by frost or rot [see footnote]. And I say this as a lifelong
  Labour voter. Dariel Francis Tunbridge Wells, Kent * See footnote • A key
  point not covered in your article (YouTube most popular first TV destination
  for children, Ofcom finds, 30 July) is the extent to which schools,
  particularly primaries, use YouTube, from movement breaks to educational
  programmes and quiet-time cartoons before home time. Cat Mehta Weybridge,
  Surrey • While I enjoyed his review of Millet at the National Gallery (5
  August), I do wonder about Jonathan Jones’s inner life. Maybe the potato fork
  isn’t a phallic symbol. And the sawyers “look as if they are cutting up a
  giant penis”. Couldn’t it be just a tree trunk? Dave Verguson Huddersfield,
  West Yorkshire • Surely one should be surprised if a long-established British
  university did not have a history of involvement in what are now seen as
  highly questionable and morally unsustainable theories, such as “racist
  science” (Letters, 4 August). Harvey Sanders London • How apposite your
  front-page image in the print edition was on Hiroshima Day (From above, Gaza
  is like the aftermath of an apocalypse, 6 August). John Pelling Coddenham,
  Suffolk • This footnote was added on 11 August 2025. When Jeremy Corbyn wrote
  “digging ground for potatoes” in February, he meant “manuring and preparing
  the ground, before planting the potatoes in March or April”, as he said in a
  letter in response to this Dariel Francis’s.
