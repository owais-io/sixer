  Denmark is to stop charging VAT on books in an attempt to get more people
  reading. At 25%, the country’s tax rate on books is the highest in the world,
  a policy the government believes is contributing to a growing “reading
  crisis”. The culture minister, Jakob Engel-Schmidt, announced on Wednesday
  that the government would propose in its budget bill that the tax on books be
  removed. The move is expected to cost 330m kroner (£38m) a year. “This is
  something that I, as minister of culture, have worked for, because I believe
  that we must put everything at stake if we are to end the reading crisis that
  has unfortunately been spreading in recent years,” Engel-Schmidt told the
  Ritzau news agency . “I am incredibly proud. It is not every day that one
  succeeds in convincing colleagues that such massive money should be spent on
  investing in the consumption and culture of the Danes.” Other Nordic countries
  also charge a standard rate of 25% VAT, but it does not apply to books. VAT on
  books in Finland is 14%, in Sweden 6% and in Norway zero. Sweden reduced its
  VAT on books in 2001, resulting in a rise in book sales, but analysis found
  they were bought by existing readers. “It is also about getting literature out
  there,” said Engel-Schmidt. “That is why we have already allocated money for
  strengthened cooperation between the country’s public libraries and schools,
  so that more children can be introduced to good literature.” A total of 8.3m
  books were sold in shops and online in Denmark in 2023, according to the
  national statistics office. The country’s population is just over 6 million.
  The most popular genre was books for the very young, picture books and
  activity books and the second-most popular was crime, thrillers and suspense
  novels. If prices do not fall as a result of the measure, Engel-Schmidt said
  he would reconsider whether it was the right course of action. “I will of
  course monitor how prices develop. If it turns out that abolishing VAT only
  means that publishers’ profits grow and prices do not fall, then we must
  consider whether it was the right thing to do,” he said.
