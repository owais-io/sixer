  Is sarcasm the lowest form of wit? If not, what is? Jason Frank, Cumbria Send
  new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply I’ve always wondered why
  only the first half of the quote by Oscar Wilde is being discussed. The full
  quote is: “Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, but the highest form of
  intelligence.” Ffesterr Sarcasm is quite complex and can facilitate
  exceptional sophistication in humour. I think the lowest form of wit is that
  thing where you repeat the last thing a person said back to them. For example:
  “The weather looks a bit wet and windy.” “You look a bit wet and windy.”
  Porthos Miners’ jokes: they’re the pits. bricklayersoption I distanced myself
  from sarcasm when I realised those I used it with had no idea I was being
  sarcastic. So, as with the adage that if you have to explain a joke, it isn’t
  a joke; if you have to explain you are being sarcastic, then it isn’t wit.
  dallastxhollywood Not all puns, but the sort of awful puns people come up with
  when any semblance of cleverness or double meaning is gone from the wordplay
  and it’s just an awkward forcing of words that barely sound right. Say, if
  people were trying to pun about cheese and someone said: “That would be a
  gouda time.” Jebedee Dunno – I thought that was edam good joke. PeteTheBeat A
  man went into a baker’s shop and asked: “Do you have any buns?” The baker
  replied: “We no longer bake buns.” “Why ever not?” asked the man. The baker
  replied: “Because the bun is the lowest form of wheat.” Scotford Lawrence
