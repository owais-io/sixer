  Wallabies and Springboks in identity swap for clash amid thin air of Highveld

  One team boasts some of the most menacing forwards found anywhere in the
  world. The other is developing a backline capable of tearing apart any
  defence. Business as usual, then, for a Wallabies versus Springboks clash.
  Except this time, like the characters of Freaky Friday, the two sides have
  switched identities ahead of the first round of the Rugby Championship.
  Australia might have lost the British &amp; Irish Lions series but they were
  one referee’s decision at the breakdown away from causing a seismic upset.
  That the margin was so small was thanks largely to the thundering cameos of
  Will Skelton, Rob Valetini, Taniela Tupou and a handful of other meaty men who
  provided the front-foot grunt that was absent in the first Test in Brisbane.
  As for the Boks, under attack coach Tony Brown – the former All Black fly-half
  – the back-to-back world champions have shed their stereotype. These are no
  longer the burly brutes of old but sprinters and schemers, running from deep,
  off-loading in the tackle, unleashing a conveyor belt of diminutive
  scrum-cap-wearing wingers with nitroglycerin in their boots. Adding this sense
  of altered egos is the makeup of the two benches. Rassie Erasmus named his
  Boks team early on Monday and picked three backs among the replacements, a
  departure from his usual reliance on the infamous “Bomb Squad”, the moniker
  given to six or seven forwards who enter the scene like a herd of rampaging
  buffalo. Joe Schmidt waited until Thursday to announce his 23 which includes
  six forwards and just two backs in reserve. How often, if ever, has a
  Wallabies bench weighed more than their Boks counterparts? Does this mean that
  we’ll see a total inverse from what has come before? Not quite. The Springboks
  will still look to front up physically and Erasmus’s decision to start Malcolm
  Marx at hooker, rather than bring him on around the hour mark as he usually
  does, is a sign that he intends to land a few early blows. This could be in
  response to the threat posed by Will Skelton, one of the most unique forwards
  in the game given his 2.03m 135kg frame that falls like a felled redwood over
  the gainline. When he carries he requires the attention of at least two
  tacklers, thinning the line elsewhere. There’s every chance Erasmus has
  multiple code-named moves that directly address the conundrum that is Skelton.
  But that imposing body doesn’t have an engine that can last 80 minutes.
  Against the Lions, after missing the first Test, he was subbed early in the
  second half in both the second and third rubbers. If the Wallabies have any
  hope of pulling off an upset they’ll need a lead by the time the big unit is
  hooked on Saturday. Compounding matters for the tourists is the absence of
  Valetini, who has been unable to shake a calf injury. His abrasive presence
  will be missed around the fringe especially as Erasmus has picked a trio of
  rangy loose forwards. There are two open-sides on either flank – the jackaling
  Marco van Staden and the two-time World Rugby player of the year, Pieter-Steph
  du Toit – with captain Siya Kolisi given licence to play towards the ball from
  No 8. All three of them will target the fly-half channel and look to leave a
  mark on the 35-year-old James O’Connor, playing his first game in gold for
  three years. Even without Valetini the Wallabies will fancy their chances at
  the breakdown. This has been an area of concern for the Springboks as they’ve
  sacrificed support over the ball for extra bodies in the attack line.
  Recently, both Italy and Georgia more than held their own at the ruck against
  South Africa. Harry Wilson, Fraser McReight, Tom Hooper and the two loose
  forwards on the bench will know that ascendancy in their sphere of influence
  could prove decisive. Should they fail the Boks will run rampant. The
  freewheeling Manie Libbok has won the three-way battle for the No 10 jersey,
  edging out the more reliable Handre Pollard and the all-rounder Sacha
  Feinberg-Mngomezulu. On his inside he’ll have Grant Williams, a zippy
  scrum-half who prefers sniping through gaps to setting up metronomic phases or
  box-kicking behind a wall. With altitude being a factor at Ellis Park – the
  stadium in Johannesburg sits 1,800 metres above sea-level, resulting in
  visiting teams fatiguing late in the piece – the Boks’ half-backs will want to
  stretch the game as much as possible. This has all the ingredients to be the
  strangest Wallabies v Springboks clash since the two teams first squared up 92
  years ago. Roles reversed, styles swapped, history tilted. Green and gold,
  gold and green. Victory for either side could see them embark on a wholly new
  trajectory.
