  Bukayo Saka has said Arsenal will be punished if they repeat the “sloppiness
  and bad decisions” they displayed in Sunday’s 1-0 victory over Manchester
  United at Old Trafford. Arsenal claimed all three points through Riccardo
  Calafiori’s 13th-minute header after the United goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir,
  palmed the ball on to the left-back’s head from a Declan Rice corner. Overall,
  the visitors were ineffective, managing only nine shots to United’s 22. United
  also dominated possession, with a 61.9% share. “It was not a great
  performance,” Saka said. “We were not up to our usual standards, the basics,
  sloppy giveaways. Our decision-making was not great and that cost us and gave
  United a lot of momentum. We did not get punished for it, but we can not do it
  every game.” Viktor Gyökeres had a muted Premier League debut after his £65m
  arrival from Sporting last month and was replaced after 60 minutes. Saka has
  backed the Sweden striker to come good. “I was impressed with him and he
  battled for us,” said the winger. “His performance gives us something to build
  on and I am sure it will help him next week. He has slotted in well and so
  have the other guys.” Keeper David Raya echoed Saka’s analysis. “[It’s] a
  difficult place to come and get the three points and a clean sheet,” he told
  arsenal.com. “But we know it wasn’t good enough with the ball and we made a
  lot of mistakes, so there’s a lot of things to improve.” “We know coming to
  this place how important it is to be alert. [It’s] the willingness [that’s
  important], the fight, the spirit that we have altogether, where things are
  not going our way and we make mistakes, everybody’s sprinting back and trying
  to help the teammate that’s made a mistake to recover the ball and to do the
  right thing. “We did that and we dug deep very, very well, especially the last
  10-15 minutes where they threw everything to us and we defended very well”
