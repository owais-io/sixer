  Barclays has become the second UK bank to withdraw from a UN-backed net zero
  target-setting group, claiming that a wave of defections by international
  lenders meant it was no longer fit for purpose. It marks a fresh blow for the
  Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), after HSBC left in early July. It came
  months after a wave of exits by US banks, which departed in the run-up to
  Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Lenders and other finance firms have
  come under fresh pressure over their green commitments as a result of Trump’s
  return to the White House, which caused a climate backlash as he pushed for
  higher production of oil and gas. The UN environment programme’s finance
  initiative, which is led by banks, required members to ensure their lending,
  investment and capital markets activities would lead them to hitting net zero
  emissions targets by 2050 or earlier. However, Barclays said it was no longer
  effective, given it no longer counted some of the world’s biggest lenders as
  members. The US lenders who cancelled their membership at the start of the
  year include JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman
  Sachs. Barclays said in a statement on Friday afternoon: “After consideration,
  we have decided to withdraw from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. With the
  departure of most of the global banks, the organisation no longer has the
  membership to support our transition.” On Thursday, the chief executive of
  Standard Chartered, Bill Winters, condemned rival banks for dropping their
  climate commitments amid mounting political pressure, saying: “Shame on them.”
  He criticised firms that had jumped on the climate bandwagon when it was
  “fashionable”, but had since rolled back on their green ambitions or gone
  quiet on the subject. “We are committed to our ambition to be a net zero bank
  by 2050,” Barclays said, adding that its plans to issue $1tn (£750bn) in loans
  to fund sustainable projects and help firms transition to more
  climate-friendly operations “remain unchanged”. “We continue to work with our
  clients on their transition, finance the transition and scale climate tech,
  while helping to ensure energy security for our customers and clients,” the
  bank added. “This is an important commercial opportunity for Barclays; in
  2024, we generated approximately half a billion pounds in revenues from
  sustainable and transition-related activity.”
