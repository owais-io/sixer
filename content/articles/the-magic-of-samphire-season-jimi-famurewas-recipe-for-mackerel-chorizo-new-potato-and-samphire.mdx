  North Norfolk captured our hearts by stealth. For most of my life, this arcing
  coastal stretch of East Anglia was somewhere I had never visited, nor ever
  spent that much time thinking about; a span of English countryside that I
  mostly associated with Alan Partridge, Colman’s mustard and, in the context of
  my south London home, an awkward schlep. But then, almost exactly a decade
  ago, I stumbled through an internet rabbit hole on to an entry for a clutch of
  self-catering cottages in a seaside village near the gently bougie,
  wax-jacketed market town of Holt. Decision made. Soon we were rumbling out
  across an impossibly wide and flat expanse, bound for the ripe, blustering
  winds and billowing steam trains of a varied network of time-warp beaches and
  little towns. Not expecting much, and yet falling a little more in love with
  each passing moment and meal, with each glistening fistful of perfect chips
  from No1 Cromer or a tea room crab roll after watching seals nose out of the
  water at Blakeney Point. The arrival of a second kid, pandemic lockdowns and
  juddering personal and professional life shifts – all of these significant
  markers across the past 10 years have been punctuated by repeat trips to this
  understatedly beautiful strip of once-alien coastline. And though we have seen
  this part of the world in many different modes, the phrase that best
  crystallises my associative excitement is this: samphire season. I had
  definitely eaten and enjoyed the spindly green sea vegetable before our north
  Norfolk years, but I don’t think it was until we visited in summer, when
  samphire is at its abundant, fleeting peak in the tidal mudflats that gird the
  shoreline, that I appreciated its connection to East Anglian culinary culture,
  or how special it is when sampled at the source. When summer hits, this briny,
  delicately beaded marsh grass (locally pronounced more like “sam-fer”) is a
  comforting ubiquity, lurking on restaurant blackboards, in fishmonger window
  displays and in the DIY honesty boxes that ornament the wending coastal roads.
  There is a core memory from a few years ago: sticky-fingered, sandy kids in
  the car, and my wife Madeleine running from the passenger side to procure one
  of the last paper bags of foraged samphire from a roadside table amid the
  marshy, glimmering swelter of a little village called Salthouse. An
  improvisatory hodge-podge back in the holiday cottage kitchen yielded
  butter-fried new potatoes and samphire, alongside vegetarian chorizo sausages:
  a deeply weird but extraordinarily effective combination in which the waxy
  starch and fatty, paprika spicing somehow both muffle and complement the
  salinity of those nobbled green tufts. In the intervening years, I have
  evolved and refined the pleasure of that moment into a loose recipe, with the
  helpful lubrication of a potato salad dressing and an optional lily-gilding of
  fatty fish. Chop 200g chorizo (vegetarian or vegan, if preferred) into hunks
  and roast in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 15-20 minutes, until cooked
  through and golden. Meanwhile, boil 500g good, skin-on small potatoes in a pan
  of scantly salted simmering water for about 10 minutes, or until they just
  slip off the tip of a knife, adding 150g samphire for the last two to three
  minutes of cooking. Drain, halve the potatoes, if need be, and leave to steam
  dry. Make a simple vinaigrette with three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive
  oil, a tablespoon of white-wine vinegar, a little salt and pepper (remember to
  hold back on the salt), a teaspoon of sugar for balance, and a generous,
  emulsifying dollop of dijon mustard, then dress the potatoes and samphire
  while they’re still warm. Separately, mix three or four generous tablespoons
  of very good mayonnaise (I like an elegant, faint cloaking, rather than
  something too gloopy; again, go vegan, if required) with three chopped spring
  onions, some chopped capers and cornichons, parsley and dill, then stir into
  the cooled veg. Serve with the contrasting warmth of the roast chorizo and, if
  it appeals and you’re not going plant-based, two fillets of fresh mackerel,
  fried for just two or three minutes on each side. Creaminess and smoky heat;
  succulent, marine crunch and herbal freshness. Samphire is an underrated
  vegetable lightly reframed, a celebration of precious high summer, of
  hyper-seasonality, and a reminder of how, against the odds, a British-Nigerian
  city boy fell hard for this sleepy stretch of Partridge country. Picky by Jimi
  Famurewa, is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton at £20. To order a copy for
