  Lebanese food is my go-to when I’m back in Brazil and I need a break from
  Brazilian food. My favourite Lebanese restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, Basha,
  makes the most incredible meat-stuffed cabbage rolls, charutos Libanais (which
  means Lebanese cigars and is the Portuguese name for the dish malfouf). They
  are served in a fragrant tomato broth and come with pimenta caseira (homemade
  hot sauce) and lime wedges to squeeze over, in a beautiful union of Lebanese
  and Brazilian cuisine that inspired today’s first dish. Charutos with spicy
  tomato broth and garlic oil (pictured top) Prep 20 min Cook 10 min Makes 12
  rolls For the filling 400g lamb mince 40g tomato puree/paste 15g fresh
  coriander, finely chopped ½ brown onion (60g), peeled and grated 1 garlic
  clove, peeled and finely grated or crushed ½ tsp medium curry powder ½ tsp
  dried mint ¼ tsp ground allspice 1 tsp fine sea salt About 50 twists cracked
  black pepper For the broth 15g tomato puree/paste ¼ tsp fine sea salt For the
  chard 250g rainbow chard, or Swiss chard 1 tbsp olive oil 1 scotch bonnet
  chilli, left whole 2 limes, halved For the garlic oil 1½ tbsp olive oil 20g
  salted butter 3 garlic cloves, peeled and very finely chopped ¼ tsp urfa
  chilli flakes ⅛ tsp fine sea salt Put all the filling ingredients in a bowl,
  mix well and set aside. For the broth, fill and boil the kettle, then whisk
  200g boiling water with the tomato puree and salt in a medium bowl and set
  aside. Hold the bunch of chard by the stalk over a large pan. Pour the rest of
  the boiling water from the kettle all over the leaves to soften them and make
  them easier to roll. Cut the stalks off the leaves, then chop 100g of the
  stalks as finely as possible and mix with the lamb filling (save the rest of
  the stalks for another dish). Clean a work surface and lightly grease it with
  olive oil. Lay the leaves on the work surface rib side up, taking care not to
  rip them. If the leaves are on the large side, you’ll need just one per roll;
  if they’re smaller, you may need two or three overlapping each other. Fill
  each leaf with about 50g of the lamb filling, then fold in the sides and roll
  up tightly. You should end up with about 12 rolls. Place on a tray seam side
  down. Put a 28cm-wide pan for which you have a lid on a high heat. Add a
  tablespoon of olive oil and, once hot, lay in the chard rolls seam side down
  and fry for two and a half minutes on each side, until nicely browned. Pour
  over the tomato broth and drop in the whole scotch bonnet, turn down the heat
  to low, cover and cook for four minutes more. Meanwhile, put all the
  ingredients for the garlic oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat, then cook
  gently for three minutes, until the garlic is soft, golden brown and fragrant
  (take care not to burn the garlic). Squeeze the scotch bonnet into the sauce
  to release its flavour. Drizzle the rolls with some of the garlic oil, then
  serve with the rest of the oil on the side and with lime wedges to squeeze
  over . Guava, curry and chilli meatballs If you’ve ever tried calabresa
  sausages in Brazil, which are modelled on Calabrian sausages, you’ll know that
  they are superior to just about any other sausage out there (don’t get me
  started on my contempt for English sausages, which lack flavour and texture
  and are always filled to the brim with rusk and fillers). Fresh calabresa are
  hard to come by in the UK, unless you can get to a Brazilian butcher, so I’ve
  come up with these meatballs. Just like Italian and Brazilian sausages,
  they’re packed full of flavour and have a chunky texture. I’ve added a few of
  my favourite untraditional flavours – guava jam, curry powder, scotch bonnet
  and mustard – and the result is sweet, sticky and completely addictive. Prep 5
  min Cook 10 min Serves 4 400g pork mince (not lean!) 140g pancetta or lardons,
  chopped into roughly ½cm cubes 70g guava jam, or other tropical jam like mango
  or pineapple 25g shop-bought chopped red chilli condiment 10g tomato
  puree/paste 10g English mustard 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed ½ tbsp
  olive oil, plus extra for shaping and frying 1 tsp rice vinegar 1½ tsp medium
  curry powder ¾ tsp fine sea salt ¼ tsp ground allspice About 30 twists freshly
  cracked pepper Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Put all the
  ingredients into a large bowl and mix until thoroughly combined – make sure
  you incorporate the guava jam, tomato paste and mustard thoroughly. With
  lightly oiled hands, form into eight meatballs, squeezing as you go so that
  they are compact. Heat a large frying pan on a high heat. Once hot, fry,
  turning, until crisp and well browned all over – about four minutes. Transfer
  to a baking tray and finish cooking in the oven for five minutes. Serve the
  meatballs with feijão, salad or in a sandwich. These recipes are edited
