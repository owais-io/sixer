  Kory Burke, a small producer of high-quality wines in central California,
  never believed that tariffs on imports from France or Italy could help boost
  his business. But he knew for sure they would be a big hindrance as soon as
  Donald Trump announced late last month that he was slapping a 15% levy on all
  goods from the European Union. “The first email I received was from my cork
  provider,” Burke recalled. “He said he’d take on 2% of the additional cost of
  importing corks from Europe, but I would have to absorb the other 13%. Then my
  barrel supplier got in touch, pushing me to put in my orders as fast as
  possible because every new French barrel coming across the Atlantic after the
  tariffs was going to come with a $100 or $150 fee.” Every one of these
  messages was a gut punch for Burke’s five-year-old family-run business,
  Dresser Winery, which sits on an idyllic hillside outside Paso Robles and
  specializes in big, bold reds. Burke sent a note out to his wine club members
  earlier this year telling them he did not plan on increasing prices for the
  fall shipment, but he realized he could no longer honor the commitment. “If we
  do that,” he said flatly, “we have to shut the business down.” It turns out
  even US wine producers are heavily reliant on foreign components – everything
  from French oak barrels, which give the wine a buttery, vanilla finish in
  contrast to the much less appealing brown sugar taste of American oak, to
  glass bottles and corks and the wine-making equipment itself. “Every single
  product we use, from our pumps to the de-stemmer, comes with instructions
  written in six languages,” Burke explained. “Could we produce some of these
  things here? Sure, but it would take three years to get production up and
  running, and that’s not the way the specialization has been.” As another
  producer from Paso Robles, Paul Hoover of Still Waters Vineyards, put it: “The
  only thing in my bottles made in America is the wine.” Ostensibly, Trump’s
  tariffs on imported goods are supposed to give a competitive boost to American
  entrepreneurs like Burke and Hoover. But the theory does not really apply to
  the wine business – not only because so many of the materials used to make
  California wine come from overseas, but also because people do not buy wine
  based on price alone. “It is a fundamental misunderstanding of wine drinkers
  and the wine marketplace,” the National Association of Wine Retailers, an
  industry lobby group, said in a blistering statement in response to the 15%
  tariff announcement. “Champagne is not sparkling wine. Bordeaux is not simply
  cabernet sauvignon or merlot … America’s independent fine wine retailers
  understand better than most that when an American wine drinker asks for red
  Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of
  their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.” Burke
  echoed this sentiment, saying he had to control his reaction recently when a
  Trump supporter came to his winery and told him he must be excited about the
  business opportunities the tariffs will create. “People aren’t buying my
  bottles because of tariffs on French wines, that’s for sure,” he said. “If
  anything, I’m competing against other Californian and American wines. With
  European wines, it’s not a real competition at all. They’re very different
  regions, very different products.” California wines are far from the cheapest
  because of the high cost of land and labour in the Golden state. For that
  reason, many producers live or die by the quality of what they make and the
  sort of subtle distinctions that come from varietals grown in a particular
  microclimate, or in a particular soil, or aged in a particular barrel. Price
  still matters, because fine wines are a discretionary spending item, and if
  the economy or people’s personal finances are struggling it is often one of
  the first things that consumers stop buying. The National Association of Wine
  Retailers, said it was worried about tariffs generally, not just on wine,
  because inflation and an uncertain business climate would hurt its members’
  bottom line just as much. “The increased costs of living that will result from
  the recently enacted tariffs, along with the significant increase in prices
  for wines … will only push down consumption further, thereby harming the
  American wine industry to a degree from which many of its participants will
  not recover,” the group said. In Paso Robles, which has seen an explosion in
  the number of wineries over the past two decades to about 250 and has become a
  major weekend tourist hub for wine lovers from San Francisco and Los Angeles,
  some of the harmful effects are being felt already. Joel Peterson, executive
  director of the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, said international orders
  were drying up as the reverberations from Trump’s trade war echo around the
  globe. “We have wine sitting in a warehouse that is specially labeled for the
  Canadian market that producers can’t sell,” he said. “We’ve had no orders from
  the UK since Trump’s so-called Liberation Day in April. People are scared to
  order those wines.” Domestic retailers say they have not seen significant
  price increases kick in yet – for either domestic or European wines – but are
  already starting to struggle simply because of the uncertainty created by the
  White House’s constantly shifting messages on where and at what rate it
  intends to impose tariffs. “We’re not in a recession but it’s what I call a
  recess market,” said Jim Knight, co-owner of the Wine House in Los Angeles,
  which specializes in small-label boutique wines from the United States and
  around the world. “People have money, they’re just not spending it … If the
  president made a decision and stuck with it, we could plan for it. But we
  haven’t been able to plan for it.” Knight’s business has a particular problem
  with high-end French wines it bought in advance years ago – right after the
  grapes were harvested – and presold to customers with an anticipated 10%
  mark-up. When tariffs on European wines were briefly at 10% earlier this year,
  Knight was looking at his entire profit being wiped out, since tariffs are
  imposed when goods arrive in the United States, not when they are purchased.
  Now, at 15%, he’s looking at taking a loss that might force him to lay off
  workers or otherwise shrink his business. For now, he is letting the wine sit
  in a temperature-controlled storage unit in France and hoping Trump might
  still bend to pressure from the industry to create a tariff exception for
  wines and spirits. An industry initiative called Toasts not Tariffs has been
  lobbying the White House hard to do exactly that. More broadly, Knight said he
  was worried that small European producers would no longer offer their limited
  production to the US market, and that some of the specialist importers, the
  ones who love the same smaller label wines he does, will go out of business.
  “Importers of wine from the European Union are American businesses too,” he
  remarked. That helps explain why a US distributor of European wines and
  spirits, VOS Selections of New York, has been the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit
  challenging the constitutionality of Trump’s tariffs – a case that led to an
  initial ruling against the administration in the court of international trade
  at the end of May. Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University who
  has spearheaded the suit, said the nature of the wine business was a vivid
  illustration of the harm that tariffs can do. “Many of the wines our client
  imports simply cannot be produced in the United States because of differences
  in climate, soil and other factors,” he said. “We’re not benefiting American
  industry, we’re damaging it and hurting consumers.” Not every wine producer
  sees the economic outlook as uniformly gloomy. Hoover, of Still Waters
  Vineyards, said the cost of storing and transporting wine was a greater burden
  than the price of corks or bottles – particularly for California producers who
  have too much inventory on their hands following a post-Covid boom-and-bust
  cycle. He said he was relieved at a drop in fuel prices in recent months and
  saw opportunities if they fell further. He was modestly hopeful, for example,
  that he could tap into sales opportunities on the east coast where he was
  previously priced out. “Before the tariffs, a boat coming from Europe could
  deliver wine to the east coast more efficiently than I could getting it across
  the United States on a truck,” he said. “Let’s see how that looks going
  forward. Energy costs are the key to this. Let’s hope the tariffs don’t monkey
  that up.” One of the main reasons that people in the wine business do not
  believe the tariffs will benefit domestic producers, as the White House is
  promising, is that they have seen this scenario play out before, during
  Trump’s first term as president. In 2019, the administration imposed a 25%
  tariff on most European wines, among other products, in retaliation for
  European subsidies on Airbus passenger jets. Trump said at the time that the
  relatively low price of French wines was unfair to California producers, but
  no evidence emerged that the tariff did anything to redress that perceived
  unfairness. “It did not increase my domestic wine sales at all,” Knight said.
