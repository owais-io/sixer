  The Royal Ballet and Opera has pulled its 2026 production run of Tosca at the
  Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv. The internal announcement by the RBO chief
  executive, Alex Beard, was made after almost 200 Royal Opera and Ballet
  members signed an open letter criticising the organisation’s stance on Gaza.
  Beard acknowledged the “open letter that has been circulating internally” and
  told staff: “We have made the decision that our new production of Tosca will
  not be going to Israel.” The Israeli Opera website has dropped reference to
  the Royal Opera House. The letter sent to Beard and the RBO board on Friday
  was signed by 182 RBO members including dancers, singers, musicians and staff
  across artistic, creative, technical and administrative departments. It is
  understood that 40 signatories signed with their names while the others signed
  anonymously because of fear of reprisals. The members said they were deeply
  concerned about “recent actions and decisions taken by the RBO in the context
  of the ongoing genocide in Gaza”. In particular, the signatories highlighted
  the RBO’s recent hiring out of its production of Turandot to the Israeli
  Opera. “The decision cannot be viewed as neutral,” they said. “It is a
  deliberate alignment, materially and symbolically, with a government currently
  engaged in crimes against humanity. “The venue itself, the Israeli Opera,
  publicly offers free tickets to soldiers of the Israeli Defense Forces ‘in
  recognition of their work’, as stated on their website. The RBO is clearly
  making a strong political statement by allowing its production and
  intellectual property to be presented in a space that openly rewards and
  legitimises the very forces responsible for the daily killings of civilians in
  Gaza.” They said they rejected “any current or future performances in Israel”
  and demanded the organisation “withholds our productions from institutions
  that legitimise and economically support a state engaged in the mass killing
  of civilians”. Production hires mean sets, props and costumes are rented out
  to another opera house. Preparations for Turandot were taking place when the
  Israel-Iran war broke out, and rehearsals were held in bomb shelters. The
  Guardian understands at least one performer decided to leave the production
  and sought therapy because of this. The signatories also expressed solidarity
  with Daniel Perry, the performer who raised the Palestinian flag in “an act of
  courage and moral clarity on our very stage” on 19 July. They condemned what
  they called “extremely poor judgment” by RBO’s director of opera, Oliver
  Mears, who “we witnessed attempting to forcibly snatch the flag from the
  performer, displaying visible anger and aggression in front of the entire
  audience”. Perry later said Mears told him he would “never work for the Opera
  House ever again”. The signatories called for Mears “to be held accountable
  for his public display of aggression” and said the act, “far from being a
  neutral administrative intervention, was itself a loud political statement. It
  sent a clear message that any visible solidarity with Palestine would be met
  with hostility.” The letter highlighted the role the arts had historically
  played during times of crisis, and cited the RBO’s swiftness to stand in
  solidarity with Ukraine after Russia’s invasion. It said: “We organised
  Concerts for Ukraine, we played the Ukrainian national anthem before
  performances, and we publicly displayed the Ukrainian flag as a gesture of
  solidarity with its people. We understood then that silence was unacceptable.
  Why is it different now? … The double standard is deafening.” Organisers of
  the letter said years spent working to change public perceptions of the RBO to
  make it more inclusive and accessible were “threatened by recent choices”. The
  RBO confirmed to the Guardian that Tosca would not go to the Israeli Opera.
  Beard said: “I am appalled by the crisis in Gaza and recognise the deep
  emotional impact this has had across our community and wider society. On this
  issue, we acknowledge and respect the full range of views held by our staff,
  artists and audiences. “The events at the curtain call on 19 July were without
  precedent. We have reflected carefully and reviewed our internal protocols. We
  always endeavour to act with integrity and compassion. We want our stage to
  remain a space for shared cultural appreciation, free from individual
  political statements. “Our support for Ukraine was aligned with the global
  consensus at the time. As the world’s geopolitics have become more complex,
  our stance has changed to ensure that our actions reflect our purpose and
  values.”
