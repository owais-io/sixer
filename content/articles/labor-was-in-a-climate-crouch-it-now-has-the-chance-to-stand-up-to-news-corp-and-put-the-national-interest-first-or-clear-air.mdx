  In 2021, the Labor party was in a bit of a climate crouch. It needed policies
  that could be presented at the 2022 election as credible steps towards
  addressing the century’s greatest social and economic challenge after nine
  years of the Coalition doing next-to-nothing, or less. It also felt it needed
  to not leave itself exposed to another round of damaging climate scare
  campaigns from its opponents in the Morrison government, industry lobby groups
  and the media, particularly at News Corp. It had experienced too many of
  those, from claims that a lamb roast would cost more than $100 and Whyalla
  would be wiped from the map, to baseless attacks in 2019 that its policies
  would cost an economy wrecking $60bn and, ludicrously, stop people enjoying
  weekends. Labor’s response was to make like a three-banded armadillo and,
  should danger arise, prepare to roll itself into a ball with few potentially
  sensitive areas left exposed. In policy terms, that meant offering just two
  firm emissions reduction commitments – introducing a $20bn off-budget fund to
  “rewire the nation” to allow for more renewable energy, and adopting and
  revamping a failed Coalition policy to cut industrial pollution. Its position
  was backed by a report that suggested electricity prices and emissions would
  be much lower under Labor than under the Coalition. It worked. These policies
  may not have won Labor the 2022 election, but they helped ensure it didn’t
  lose it. The campaign was defined by Scott Morrison’s failures, including on
  global heating. Climate-focused independents slayed Liberal MPs in previously
  safe seats and Anthony Albanese became prime minister. Once in power, the
  climate change minister, Chris Bowen, and the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, oversaw
  additional policies to support large-scale clean energy and cleaner cars and
  provide tax credits for new green industries. While some would take a while to
  take effect, they could make a meaningful difference. It was a start. But
  Russia invaded Ukraine, sending global fossil fuel prices skyward, and
  household electricity bills in Australia went up, not down. Inflation – a
  global phenomenon – made governing challenging. At the start of this year,
  Labor was under siege, with public and private polling suggesting it was
  headed for a historic first-term loss. The party once again took a defensive
  approach on climate before an election. It released just one policy: a battery
  subsidy scheme. And then the world turned again. Donald Trump moved into the
  White House, interest rates eased and the Liberal party under Peter Dutton ran
  a disastrous election campaign not helped by an unbelievable nuclear energy
  plan. Albanese won in a landslide. Three months on, Australia’s climate
  political landscape is barely recognisable from four years ago. The power
  dynamic is reversed. Where Labor once feared being attacked, it is now the
  aggressor, mocking the Coalition as it toys with tearing itself apart over
  whether its lesson from the loss will be to drop its support for Australia
  cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. Nearly everything about the
  opposition’s climate debate is a charade. It went to the election planning to
  increase climate pollution by abolishing Labor’s climate policies and
  introducing none of its own for at least a decade. It opposed net zero but
  just didn’t own up to it. And the election result makes it largely irrelevant
  for the next 2 ½ years anyway. With Barnaby Joyce as its most vocal climate
  policy advocate, its internal fight is being held miles away from where most
  Australians live or how they think. Meanwhile, parties and candidates that
  openly back the case for deep cuts in emissions – Labor, “teal” independents
  and the Greens – share a clear majority of the primary vote. It doesn’t mean
  everyone who voted for one of these groups wants the same thing, or that
  political support for their policies will necessarily be endless. But it does
  suggest there is an opportunity here – that most people are open to Australia
  being much more aggressive on climate if the case that it is good for the
  country and its people is well made. The timing couldn’t be better. Big
  decisions are looming, including on Australia’s emissions reduction target for
  2035 and the policies that will be needed to back it up. Labor backbenchers
  are arguing it should be ambitious. The evidence of the past couple of weeks
  is that, wherever it lands, the government should expect fierce resistance.
  Take News Corp’s national flagship, The Australian. Since parliament returned
  late last month, it has dedicated significant space to what is basically a
  campaign against climate action dressed up as news coverage. Its approach is
  not new. The costs of acting and the challenges that come with renewable
  energy are over-emphasised and exaggerated. The costs of not acting, including
  the opportunity cost of continuing to back fossil fuels over clean
  alternatives, are ignored. The level of international action – a valid area
  for sceptical scrutiny – is painted in the worst possible light. The global
  climate science consensus is rejected, downplayed or not mentioned. The
  implicit message is that cutting greenhouse gas emissions is a weird, leftwing
  pursuit, rather than a serious and inevitable challenge that needs to be
  addressed. Privately, members of the government are scathing of how the
  country’s biggest newspaper publisher reports on the climate crisis. They also
  acknowledge the company is less influential than it used to be. But Canberra
  is a small place, Australia a limited media market, and old habits are hard to
  shake. A key question for Albanese and his cabinet colleagues will be whether
  they are willing to just ignore the company’s one-sided framing and avoid
  being fooled into believing it represents a mainstream public that it needs to
  factor in. Put another way: Labor will need to decide if it has ditched the
  crouch. The government is about to receive long-awaited advice from the
  Climate Change Authority on the 2035 target. It is likely to include a target
  range, based on what the authority’s board considers ambitious and achievable.
  It’s been consulting on a cut of 65% to 75% below 2005 levels. Given where the
  electorate and future economy sit, there is a strong case for Labor to set a
  target at the ambitious end of that range and stretch to get there. Some
  emissions cuts – through better energy efficiency and reducing potent methane
  leaks at fossil fuel sites – are cost effective and just waiting to be made.
  Others would be tougher, requiring the government to acknowledge that local
  emissions from expanding export coal and gas industries are substantial and
  can’t be written off forever as someone else’s problem – and that new green
  industries in hydrogen, steel and other commodities are likely to struggle to
  flourish until their polluting competitors decline. An ambitious climate goal
  would be demanding. But it could also trigger a range of positives. Who knows?
  If well-handled, they might even include the government being rewarded by the
  bulk of the population, who have now hinted more than once it is what they
  want.
