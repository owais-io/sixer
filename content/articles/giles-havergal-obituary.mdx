  There have been many golden periods in the British postwar regional theatre –
  at Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham – but few so
  idiosyncratic, audacious and European as at the Glasgow Citizens theatre under
  the artistic directorship of Giles Havergal, who has died aged 87. Havergal,
  with his co-directors, the designer Philip Prowse and the playwright and
  translator Robert David MacDonald, ran the beautiful jewel of a Victorian
  theatre on the south side of the Clyde in the Gorbals from 1969 to 2003, the
  longest tenure in post of any British director. The secret of his success was
  simple: balance the books. If you don’t give the board that headache, they
  don’t care what you do. The miracle was that this thriftily run organisation
  won a reputation for extravagant, beautifully costumed productions in a
  repertoire that included the plays of Tennessee Williams, John Webster and the
  Jacobeans (a Prowse speciality), Brecht, Pirandello, Goldoni, Karl Kraus,
  Lermontov, Goethe and even Proust. Remembrance of Things Past was translated
  by MacDonald in 1980 as A Waste of Time, telling Proust’s story backwards over
  four hours on a stage of gilded frames. Havergal played Baron de Charlus with
  debonair, sinister panache. The tone of outlandish provocation was set with a
  1970 all-male production of Hamlet, with nudity, copulation, reams of black
  satin, over-pitched, screeching delivery and a rock-star lead performance by
  David Hayman that drove the Scotsman critic on to the front page in horror and
  led to the cancellation of school party bookings; the kids came along anyway,
  and the place was packed. The seats were 50p – a huge banner declared as much
  across the front entrance – in a theatre where all actors had an equal wage,
  there was no billing, a free programme and a tone of creative bravado. The
  philosophy was, said Havergal, that if nobody liked what we do, we were free
  to do what we liked. This was in a city where Brecht was box office and all
  the political squabbles – the lord provost, who never went near the place,
  said that he did not have to go down a sewer to know that it stank – were
  defused thanks to the charm and public relations skills of Havergal and his
  supportive chairman, Bill Taylor, and, it must be said, the unwavering support
  of the Guardian critic Cordelia Oliver. It helped that Havergal, Prowse and
  MacDonald, who took all the auditions, had such finely tuned noses for talent.
  The stream of superb young actors who started out with them included Mark
  Rylance, Pierce Brosnan, Celia Imrie, Patricia Quinn, Ann Mitchell, Alan
  Rickman, Greg Hicks, Rupert Frazer, Jonathan Hyde, Roberta Taylor, Gerard
  Murphy, Ciarán Hinds, Siân Thomas, Gary Oldman and Rupert Everett. Havergal
  managed to establish so flagrantly daring a theatre in the community at large
  with his Theatre About Glasgow schools programme, a policy of free previews,
  and a warm welcome to other Scottish companies over the summer months. When
  not appearing on the stage himself – his most memorable performances included
  Old Lady Squeamish in Wycherley’s The Country Wife in 1977 and a solo Death in
  Venice (as the writer Von Aschenbach) in 2000, which he performed later all
  over the world – he was in the foyer, every night, welcoming the audience
  generally and often individually. He was a tall, genial presence,
  aquiline-featured, dressed in black, a brilliant communicator who really did
  believe the show started when the audience first stepped into the theatre.
  When Glasgow was European city of culture in 1990, Glenda Jackson – who had
  played an unforgettable Phedra for Prowse and McDonald at the Citizens and Old
  Vic in 1984 – gave a gut-wrenching, raucous Mother Courage. “It’s a very
  special theatre,” she said, “in a very special city.” Havergal was born in
  Edinburgh, the second son of Henry Havergal, choirmaster, and principal of the
  Royal Academy of music and drama in Glasgow, and his wife, Margaret (nee
  Chitty). He was educated at Harrow school in north London, and Christ Church,
  Oxford, where he made a lifelong friend of the writer Ferdinand Mount. His
  first job, in 1961, was as an assistant stage manager in Carlisle, followed by
  stints at the Oldham Coliseum and Barrow. He was appointed artistic director
  of the Watford Palace in 1966, where he directed the British premiere of
  Tennessee Williams’s Sweet Bird of Youth starring Vivien Merchant in 1968.
  That opening Hamlet featured 18 actors of an average age of 22 years. The
  policy of “famous plays in interesting ways” with no thought of a transfer to
  the West End or anywhere else was adhered to throughout, except for an
  unsuccessful transplant of Molière’s Don Juan to the Roundhouse and the two
  hit Jackson shows moving to the Old Vic and the Mermaid. Even in the anarchic
  1970s, no other theatre presented something as astonishing as the De Sade Show
  (1976), whose literary sources included 120 Days of Sodom, the novels Justine
  and Juliette, and a social/narrative binding derived by MacDonald from the
  master/servant comedies of Marivaux. Then there was MacDonald’s Chinchilla
  (1977), which also visited the Edinburgh festival, a charged meditation on the
  Venice Lido of Diaghilev replacing Nijinsky in his personal and professional
  affections with Massine, and expressing what sounded like a manifesto of
  Havergal’s theatre: “passion for reform, passion for power, passion for
  beauty, a thirst to show, a lust to tell, a rage to love”. In the 1980s, a
  Genet retrospective incorporated the Victorian boxes of the theatre itself
  into the stage design; Coward’s The Vortex, with Everett and Maria Aitken,
  offered a pathology of addiction and implied a perennial decadence as well as
  an absolute modernity; and a budgetary crisis (not the first) impelled
  Havergal to adapt Graham Greene’s Travels with My Aunt as a play for four male
  actors in grey suits and maroon V-necked sweaters. Travels was a big hit and
  three years later was remounted in the West End, where it won an Olivier award
  in 1993. Havergal himself was in the cast, all of whom were versions of the
  protagonist Henry Pulling, all assuming the other characters without costume
  changes, Havergal as a suitably imperious Aunt Augusta. As a third-person
  narrative, in the style of the Shared Experience company, it was simple, and
  it was brilliant. In the early 1990s, two smaller studios, one at the back of
  the stalls, the other on the side of the circle, were added, but all three
  Citizens spaces were imaginatively programmed, no soft options. So, Death in
  Venice played alongside Prowse’s revelatory, unsentimental take on Coward’s
  Cavalcade in the big auditorium in 1999; while, in 2003, a fresh look at a
  genuinely good thriller, Dial M for Murder, jostled alongside a steamy,
  gorgeous new studio version of Colette’s Chéri. The seat prices had risen by
  now to £12, with £4 concessions, and the still free previews. Havergal had
  overseen a drastic front-of-house refurbishment, a wonderful new foyer and
  improved facilities while retaining the style, atmosphere and statuary of the
  1878 original. Outside of the Citizens, Havergal had rediscovered a Scottish
  classic, Ena Lamont Stewart’s Men Should Weep, for the 7:84 theatre group in
  1982 and adapted (with another Citizens alumnus, Fidelis Morgan), for Shared
  Experience, Samuel Richardson’s 18th-century epistolary novel Pamela, as well
  as Elizabeth Bowen’s masterpiece The Heat of the Day in 1987, two years before
  the Harold Pinter television film appeared. Over the past two decades, he
  remained busy in opera, working for Opera North, Minnesota Opera, the Opera
  Theatre of St Louis and Scottish Opera, and maintained until the end of his
  life a creative relationship with the American Conservatory theatre of San
  Francisco – teaching, lecturing and directing. He never lost, he said, the
  excitement or stimulation of entering the rehearsal room with a crowd of
  young, enthusiastic actors. Havergal lived for many years in Sauchiehall
  Street in Glasgow and Battersea in London, moving in recent years to a tidy
  terraced house near Clapham Common, where he kept a beautiful small garden. He
  remained an insatiable theatregoer, serving for some years on the board of the
  Almeida theatre in Islington, north London. He was made OBE in 1987 and CBE in
  2002 and held honorary doctorates at the universities of Glasgow and
  Strathclyde, and the Scottish academy of music and drama where his father had
  been principal. Havergal’s older brother, Malcolm, predeceased him. He is
  survived by a niece, Louise. • Giles Pollock Havergal, director and actor,
  born 9 June 1938; died 23 August 2025
