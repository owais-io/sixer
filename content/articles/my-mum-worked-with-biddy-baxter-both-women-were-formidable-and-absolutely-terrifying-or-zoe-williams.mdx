  David Attenborough’s description of Biddy Baxter, when he presented her in
  2013 with a special Bafta for her 25 years’ work on Blue Peter, was easily the
  best: dedicated, passionate and pioneering. But since the producer has died,
  at 92, and other reminiscences have poured in, you can’t help but notice how
  many of them are synonyms for “scary”. “Producer” and “creator” describe
  Baxter’s work on Blue Peter, but don’t convey how totally and utterly
  everything was her idea: from Tony Hart to the Blue Peter badges, from the
  golden retrievers to the Blue Peter garden, from “here’s one we made earlier”
  to the charity appeals, she conjured it all, to make a cultural artefact that
  left no child untouched. If you ever received a Blue Peter badge, it’s odds on
  you still have it – and, if it’s a gold one, that you still talk about it. My
  mum worked on Blue Peter as a set designer, on and off, over the same period
  and was always using words such as “formidable”, “uncompromising” and “takes
  no prisoners” about Baxter. It made no sense to me as a kid, because my mum
  was terrifying at work. She revelled in how scary she was, how she could make
  fully grown carpenters quake with one eyebrow. How could there be two of them?
  Surely that would cause some kind of chemical reaction? Also, my mum didn’t
  prize the “feminine” traits of amiability and compliance, so why did she sound
  faintly critical when they were void in other women? They were different
  brands of scary: Baxter was stilettos-on-the-studio-floor scary; my mum was
  dungarees-and-cigs scary. Baxter kept presenters in their place by insisting
  the real stars were the Blue Peter pets, while the entire design department
  (if memory serves) acted like neither pets nor people held any meaning at all,
  compared with a scale model of an aquarium made of balsa wood and sticky-back
  plastic. But still, you would have expected maybe a trace of solidarity, a
  collective “in fact, neither of us is frightening in any true sense, we’re
  just professionals with strong views who happen to be women”. I didn’t see any
  of that, which speaks to Attenborough’s point about pioneers: if you’re ever
  wearing stilettos at work and telling people what to do without striking
  terror into anyone, it’s because Baxter and her ilk, from the 60s through the
  80s, were the ones they made earlier. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist •
