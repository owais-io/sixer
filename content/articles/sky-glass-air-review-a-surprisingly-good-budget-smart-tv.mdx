  Sky’s latest streaming TV aims to be a good, all-in-one budget option for your
  sitting room – and it achieves all those aims, leaving it standing strong in a
  field of mediocre, similarly priced appliances. The Glass Air is a lighter,
  slimmer and cheaper version of the Glass gen 2 and is arguably the low-cost TV
  Sky should have launched first, coming in three sizes starting at £309 or just
  £6 a month on 48-month interest-free credit with £20 upfront. As with its
  pricier siblings, Glass Air requires a Sky subscription for full use, which
  costs from £15 a month for the Essential TV pack. It will function as a basic
  smart TV with streaming apps, an aerial and its three HDMI ports, but you
  would not buy any Sky TV without the intention of paying for its
  TV-over-broadband service. Glass Air is best thought of as a cut-down version
  of Glass gen 2. It has the same service and internal smart hardware but lacks
  the integrated soundbar, aluminium body and has a different screen, making it
  a fraction of the weight and thickness. It also means all it needs is a power
  cable and an internet connection, be that via wifi or ethernet – no aerial or
  satellite cable required – and just one remote for all of your TV, streaming
  apps and services combined. It also has Sky’s voice-control system with
  integrated mics, so you can turn it on, search, control the volume and
  playback by simply saying “Hello Sky” followed by your command. You have to
  speak up a bit but it works well. Alternatively, you can press and hold the
  mic button on the remote and speak into that. The 60Hz screen is a bright and
  crisp 4K LCD panel with HDR support, but it lacks the superior local-dimming
  backlight technology present in Glass gen 2 and other higher-end TVs. That
  means the picture has one brightness across the whole scene, reducing the
  difference between light and dark areas. As a result, some high-contrast
  scenes look less dramatic and lack a little depth, while bright landscapes can
  look a little bleached out. Despite this, the television does a good job of
  displaying an engaging picture, looking great with everyday TV shows and doing
  a solid job with bright animation or moody movies. The 15W stereo speakers are
  surprisingly good for a thin TV without a soundbar. They can get loud enough
  to fill medium-sized rooms and produced clear vocals at anything up to 90%
  volume, which can’t be said of most TV speakers. They lack bass and any
  attempt at surround sound, but are certainly good enough for watching Bargain
  Hunt or the Premier League. You can use one of the three HDMI ports to connect
  a soundbar for more immersive sound, although you will need to raise the TV
  otherwise the soundbar will block a portion of the screen. Sky OS One of the
  biggest advantages of Glass Air compared with similarly priced budget TVs is
  that the software running on it is actually good. Sky OS has improved
  dramatically over the last few years and runs well on the Glass Air. It
  combines live broadcast with on-demand content seamlessly through its
  excellent playlist feature, which makes keeping track of your shows and films
  easy. Watching live TV, pausing it and rewinding it works great. Almost every
  major streaming service is supported, including BBC iPlayer, ITV X, Channel 4,
  Apple TV+, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+ and Discovery+. Glass Air also
  supports AirPlay 2 for sending content from Apple’s various devices and
  Bluetooth for connecting a set of headphones for private listening.
  Sustainability The television is repairable apart from the screen. It contains
  recycled plastic and solder. The company will recycle its old products and
  ships the TV in plastic-free packaging. Price The Sky Glass Air is available
  in three sizes with upfront costs of £309 for 43in, £509 for 55in and £649 for
  65in. It is also available on 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans
  costing from £6 with a £20 upfront fee. The minimum required Sky package is
  Essential TV costing from £15 a month, which includes Netflix and Discovery+,
  with many other combinations of entertainment, movies, kids and sports
  channels available on 24 or one month rolling plans. Verdict Sky Glass Air is
  a solid budget television with all the advantages of Sky’s pay-TV over
  broadband service built in. It is slim and light with stereo speakers that are
  far better than most slender TVs. It has a decent 4K picture that is bright
  and colourful, although it lacks a little contrast here and there. The
  physical bits of the TV are essentially good enough. Where it trounces other
  budget rivals is in the service and software, which is miles better than most
  low-end smart TVs. Of course you have to pay a monthly subscription for the
  privilege, but for those looking for Sky pay-TV you are not getting a worse
  software experience on a cheaper television. And it still has the genuinely
  great all-in-one convenience of every TV and streaming service in one box with
  one remote and just power and internet required. You can get better-looking
  mid-range TVs discounted to around this price if you shop savvy. But the Glass
  Air is great for the money and stands out against the sea of unremarkable
  budget TVs at this end of the market. Pros: all-in-one streaming and pay-TV
  device, decent vocals, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, great
  software, excellent search and playlist functions, all major streaming apps,
  voice control, custom picture modes. Cons: no local dimming means lower
  contrast, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, no Chromecast support,
  requires subscription.
