  Nigel Farage has called for the right to nominate Reform UK supporters to the
  House of Lords, claiming this would address a “democratic disparity”. The
  demand was dismissed by the defence secretary, John Healey, who said
  parliament would not benefit from “more Putin apologists”. In a letter to Keir
  Starmer, the Reform leader said it was unfair that other smaller parties,
  including the Greens, had peers in the upper chamber but his party did not,
  despite attracting more votes in the general election last year. In what
  Farage described as a “modest request”, he said it was time Reform was
  represented in the House of Lords. “Reform UK wishes to appoint life peers to
  the upper house at the earliest possible opportunity,” he said. Political
  appointments to the Lords are made at the discretion of the prime minister,
  who is under no constitutional obligation to elevate opposition figures to the
  Lords. Under political convention, however, No 10 invites opposition leaders
  to nominate candidates for peerages. Downing Street has yet to respond to
  Farage’s demand, but speaking on LBC, Healey said Farage wanted to fill the
  Lords with “his cronies”. He also pointed out that Farage had previously
  called for the abolition of the Lords. Healey said: “I’m not sure that
  parliament’s going to benefit from more Putin apologists like Nigel Farage, to
  be honest.” Asked whether that accusation was “a bit strong”, Healey replied:
  “Look at what he’s said about Russia, look at what he’s said about Putin in
  the past.” Farage’s letter, first reported in the Times, said: “My party
  received over 4.1m votes at the general election in July 2024. We have since
  won a large number of seats in local government, led in the national opinion
  polls for many months and won the only byelection of this parliament.”
  Farage’s demand has renewed calls to replace the House of Lords with an
  elected second chamber – something Starmer promised when he was elected Labour
  leader in 2020. Farage wrote: “While Reform UK believes in a reformed House of
  Lords, the time has come to address the democratic disparity that exists in
  the upper house.” His letter added: “The Greens, DUP, Plaid Cymru, and UUP
  have 13 peers between them but Reform UK has none. Furthermore, the Liberal
  Democrats now have 76 peers but received 600,000 fewer votes than Reform UK in
  July last year. “None of this holds water any longer, given the seismic shifts
  that have taken place in British politics.” Natalie Bennett, a former Green
  party leader who was made a life peer in 2019, tweeted: “Sir Keir could
  respond by going for a fully elected upper house, as @TheGreenParty long
  calling for.” Labour’s manifesto promised “immediate reforms” of the Lords in
  advance of a longer-term ambition to replace the Lords with an alternative
  second chamber. So far, the government has only legislated to abolish
  hereditary peers. Starmer has backed away from a Labour commission led by
  Gordon Brown to replace the Lords with an elected assembly of the nations and
  regions.
