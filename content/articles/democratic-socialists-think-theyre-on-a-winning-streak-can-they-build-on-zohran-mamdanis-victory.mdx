  It’s an energizing time for democratic socialists across the country, and not
  only because New York state assembly member Zohran Mamdani’s recent win in the
  New York City mayoral primary moves the United States’ most populous city
  closer than it ever has been to having a member as mayor. For supporters of
  the leftwing, worker-led political ideology, last weekend’s annual democratic
  socialists of America national convention in Chicago, which welcomed tens of
  thousands of politically minded individuals from across the country to the
  unionized McCormick Place convention center, was further recognition of the
  growing influence of the DSA, the country’s largest socialist organization,
  founded in 1982. Amid the backdrop of a fraught national political stage, one
  in which traditional Democrats are struggling to connect with voters and a
  Donald Trump-led GOP continues to push a far-right agenda, a growing cadre of
  democratic socialist politicians are finding increasing success in local
  elections by touting platforms of progressive policies, tapping into social
  media with snappy, engaging content, and connecting face to face with
  typically forgotten voter blocs. The continued presence of democratic
  socialists Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the
  New York representative; and Rashida Tlaib, the Michigan representative, in
  Congress has been an inspiration to many of these similarly minded political
  hopefuls. However, it’s Mamdani’s recent success that many DSA-endorsed
  candidates like Jake Ephros, running for Jersey City council; Kelsea Bond,
  running for Atlanta city council; Jorge Defendini, running for Ithaca common
  council; and others who attended this convention are hoping to replicate. The
  goal is to show that the campaign isn’t a flash-in-the-pan win, but instead a
  burgeoning tide shift toward a leftwing political future divorced from
  capitalism, despite criticism from traditionalist Democrats and Republicans
  alike. “Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York or Omar Fateh in Minneapolis, also
  poised to become a socialist mayor of a major city – these are things that
  come after years of structure that DSA helped build up in a bunch of chapters
  … This is also why DSA is growing so much and having all this new energy,
  because we’re just really demonstrating what the alternative is,” said Ashik
  Siddique, the national co-chair of the DSA. “The Democratic party has not
  really presented a meaningful alternative.” With the DSA’s membership having
  surged in recent months, and both the 2026 midterm and 2028 presidential
  elections on the horizon, this weekend’s convention was a key opportunity for
  many to strategize on how to capitalize on expanding influence and recent
  wins. “There’s so much excitement around our huge victory, Zohran Mamdani
  winning the primary,” said Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair for the New York City
  chapter of the DSA. “People are coming up to us and asking us about the
  campaign, wanting to learn from our experience as well, and I’ll say that the
  big change that I’ve seen over the years is that DSA as an organization has
  matured politically.” While the NYC-DSA continues its work, other chapters
  will attempt to follow its lead, organizing around their own socialist
  candidates while the national DSA organization reaffirms its position on
  Palestine, organizes to end US aid to Israel, supports the boycott, divestment
  and sanctions movement – which calls on consumers to stop supporting both
  Israeli companies and companies that have supported Israel – and stands
  against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in solidarity with
  immigrants. That and a clear economic agenda that supports the working class
  “over billionaires, the bosses, the corporations that are raising prices, that
  are keeping our wages low” are what will lead to further success for
  democratic socialist candidates, in Gordillo’s eyes. Persistence can also be
  helpful. It helped Alex Brower, who won his election for Milwaukee common
  council district three alderman in an April special election after the death
  of his predecessor, in his third bid for office as a democratic socialist.
  “That happens to a lot of socialists because … if socialists were 100%
  successful, we’d have a socialist America right now. So there’s a lot of
  losing, but I think, honestly, I think we learn more by losing than winning,”
  Brower said. Many DSA-endorsed candidates will also be deep in the throes of
  fieldwork in the coming months: knocking on doors, attending events, meeting
  with neighbors and being visible in communities, all key to keeping the DSA’s
  recent momentum going, according to Ephros, who is currently running for the
  Jersey City council on a platform of affordable social housing, universal rent
  control, universal childcare, public healthcare and the Green New Deal, among
  other issues. “It goes a long way to just demonstrate: ‘Oh, this isn’t some
  shadowy, weird, fringe guy who calls himself a socialist and that means scary
  things to me; it’s my neighbor and he’s active in the community and he’s
  showing up,’” he said. Over the three days of the convention, the conference’s
  largest in its history, DSA members gathered to deliberate resolutions that
  will guide chapter actions and concerns over the next two years. Members voted
  to approve a measure for “a fighting anti-Zionist DSA”, a resolution that
  prompted much debate and some resistance due to a clause that would expel
  members for supporting Israel. Arguments both for and against the measure were
  raised to the crowd of voting members on Sunday afternoon, delayed by calls
  from DSA leadership to hold applause in favor of the silent American Sign
  Language motion for clapping, consisting of the waving of both hands. The
  request was only mildly successful. Members also voted to prioritize efforts
  to put up a DSA-endorsed socialist candidate for the 2028 presidential
  election, and elected both new and returning delegates to the DSA’s national
  political committee, the 16-person body that serves as the organization’s
  board of directors. On Friday, members heard from Rashida Tlaib, the keynote
  speaker for this year’s convention. As one of Congress’s most outspoken
  supporters of Palestine, Tlaib largely spoke about the responsibility Congress
  has to condemn Israel’s bombing and starvation of the people in Palestine. She
  also emphasized the work she believes the DSA still has to do. “For DSA to
  live up to our potential, we have to be willing to grow ourselves. We need
  more members for more diverse communities and leadership roles, y’all. We are
  failing, and again, I’m telling you as a big sis, we are failing when a room
  like this only has a handful of our Black neighbors. You need to be
  intentional,” Tlaib said to Friday’s intently listening crowd. “A lot of
  working-class folks have strong historical ties to the Democratic party. They
  know they have been let down, and they’re looking for a new home. They want to
  envision the alternatives, and we have it.” Álvaro López, an electoral
  coordinator for NYC-DSA who assisted Mamdani’s campaign, attended the DSA
  convention for the first time after being a member since 2017. He’s grappling
  with what to take from the convention’s more introspective measures. “In this
  convention, unfortunately, Donald Trump was not raised. Zohran’s victory was
  not strategically discussed, and I think that’s a product of our larger,
  big-tent organization that we have. I think there is a lot of work for the
  left and the DSA to still get to a point where we are really thinking about
  how do we build power, and how we are not so inward looking and think of
  ourselves as the protagonist of everything around us,” López said. The
  NYC-DSA’s strategy for creating successful campaigns has previously involved
  contesting local and state-level positions, before shifting to one that seeks
  to place democratic socialists in the highest levels of local politics. With
  many DSA chapters strategizing what that looks like for them back home, taking
  similar steps may help, Gordillo believes. “Many working-class people, for
  example, don’t really know what the state assembly is,” he said. “It’s harder
  to get traction or to do mass communications that way, so we decided to run a
  socialist for mayor,” he said of reaching voters in local elections. “We need
  to do that, not just in New York City. We need to do it in Minneapolis. We
  need to do it in Los Angeles and in Detroit and Michigan, eventually in 2028.
  I hope that we take that to the federal stage in the presidential run.” A
  resolution brought up at this year’s DSA convention would create a strategy to
  build socialism in each of the 50 states and help the DSA build more statewide
  organizations. The DSA has also previously expanded an electoral program to
  provide more support to chapters that want to learn how they can run their own
  candidates and develop class-struggle elections. It’s political actions like
  these that can be the key to winning races, even by the smallest of margins,
  Tlaib said on Friday, reminding DSA members of her win in 2018 by only 900
  votes. “We are standing at a crossroads in American history,” Tlaib said. “We
  are going to take this country back for our working families and defeat these
  pathetic, cowardly, hateful fascists. We’re going to win because we don’t have
  any other options, and yes, we are going to free Palestine. They don’t have
  any other choice. Our movement isn’t going anywhere, and we’re just getting
  started.”
