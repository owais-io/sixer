  Protesters have torched parliamentary buildings in three further Indonesian
  provinces, a day after at least three people were killed by a fire started by
  demonstrators at a council building in the city of Makassar. Protests erupted
  across Indonesia after footage spread showing a motorcycle taxi driver being
  run over and killed by a police vehicle on Thursday night during earlier
  demonstrations over low wages for workers and perks for lawmakers. Regional
  parliamentary buildings in West Nusa Tenggara, Pekalongan city in Central Java
  and Cirebon city in West Java were set ablaze by protesters on Saturday,
  Reuters reported, citing local media. Indonesia’s national police chief,
  Listyo Sigit Prabowo, said the president had ordered authorities to act
  decisively against protesters who broke the law. The announcement came after
  the president, Prabowo Subianto, appealed for calm and in a statement on
  Friday said he had ordered a “thorough and transparent investigation” into the
  death of the driver, Affan Kurniawan, and urged the public to trust his
  government. Protests in Makassar in eastern Indonesia descended into chaos on
  Friday outside city council buildings, which were set on fire, and vehicles
  were set ablaze as protesters hurled rocks and molotov cocktails. Three people
  were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council building, its
  secretary, Rahmat Mappatoba, told AFP. “They were trapped in the burning
  building,” he said, accusing protesters of storming the office to set the
  building on fire. “This is beyond our prediction. Usually during a
  demonstration, protesters only threw rocks or burn a tyre in front of the
  office. They never stormed into the building or burned it,” Mappatoba added.
  Two of the victims were local council staff and another was a civil servant.
  Two died at the scene and one died in hospital. At least four people were
  injured in the fire and are being treated in hospital, the official said.
  Images showed the provincial council building ablaze overnight, but the fire
  has since been extinguished. Protesters at the South Sulawesi provincial
  council building tried to knock down the gate and storm in. In Jakarta,
  hundreds of people gathered outside the headquarters of the elite Mobile
  Brigade Corp paramilitary police unit, which they blamed for the death of the
  motorcycle taxi driver, throwing firecrackers as police responded with
  teargas. A group of protesters tried to tear down the gates of the unit, which
  is notorious for its heavy-handed tactics, and pulled a sign from the
  building’s facade in chaotic scenes. Police said they had detained seven
  officers for questioning in connection with the driver’s death. The protests
  were the biggest and most violent of Subianto’s presidency less than a year
  into his rule. Subianto has promised fast, state-driven growth but has already
  faced protests for widespread budget cuts to fund his populist policies,
  including a $1bn free meal programme. The driver’s death caused anger that had
  been brewing over government perks and the cost of living crisis to boil over.
  Since Monday, thousands of protesters have demonstrated in the capital against
  a monthly housing allowance for MPs that amounts to almost 10 times the
  Jakarta minimum wage amid the president’s austerity drive. Protests also
  spread to other big Indonesian cities on Friday, including Yogyakarta,
  Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java and Medan in North Sumatra province.
