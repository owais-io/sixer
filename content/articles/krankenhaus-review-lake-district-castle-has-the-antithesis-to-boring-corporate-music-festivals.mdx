  Krankenhaus review – Lake District castle has the antithesis to boring
  corporate music festivals

  From highly competitive dog shows to night-time stories read in a woodland,
  there’s a sense of character to Krankenhaus that is unlike most festivals.
  With fewer than 1,500 people, the Lake District event – created and curated by
  the art-rock outfit Sea Power – is intimate almost to the point of being
  familial. Set primarily in a barn with the faint linger of animal dung still
  in the air, within the stunning grounds of Muncaster Castle, it’s essentially
  an extended party for the band and their friends. The Lovely Eggs make a
  glorious racket as they hammer out a stomping set of psychedelic garage pop
  before Sea Power team up with Dean Wareham to deliver an immaculate
  performance of Galaxie 500 songs in a set that is both gentle and sprawling at
  the same time. The Moonlandingz finish the evening with a wonderfully raucous
  set that ends with frontman Lias Saoudi screaming his lungs out in the
  audience over a relentless and filthy gabber beat. A community choir singing
  Sea Power’s Blackout ends up being one of the most quietly moving things all
  weekend, while Gnod – who have a current setup of four guitarists – play a set
  so loud and punishing that it will have likely traumatised the numerous dogs
  present. This is something that Stewart Lee jokes about during a brief and
  expertly executed standup set the following day, while characterising the
  audience, with affection, as a bunch of “sandal-wearing” indie-folkers. Sea
  Power put in a herculean effort to play their third gig of the weekend on
  Sunday, despite some members being up until eight o’clock that morning,
  resulting in a chill and woozy set that feels custom-built for fragile brains.
  While Krankenhaus is endearingly back to basics, it’s also deceptively vast.
  Steam train trips and guided walks in sublime mountainous settings open up its
  cosiness into even more beautiful terrain. While so many festivals feel like
  the equivalent of an airport experience – trapped in a space and rinsed for
  all you’ve got while stuck there – Krankenhaus really leans into its location
  and encourages festival-goers to do the same. It’s genuinely unique.
