  Warning: includes images of blood and graphic scenes Ehab Nuor, a 23-year-old
  barber, lies flat on the sand behind entangled metal, hiding from heavy
  machine-gun fire, as hundreds of Palestinians scramble away, carrying
  backpacks in which they had hoped to collect food. Nuor has come under fire
  from the Israeli military near food distribution centres on more than 10
  occasions. A Guardian investigation analysing visual evidence, bullets,
  medical data and patterns of injuries from two hospitals, as well as
  interviews with medical organisations and surgeons, across approximately 50
  days of food distribution, appears to show a sustained Israeli pattern of
  firing on Palestinians seeking food. The Guardian studied more than 30 videos
  of gunfire near food distribution sites run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza
  Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). More than 2,000 Palestinians were injured
  during the 48 days investigated, mostly by gunshots. In the footage,
  machine-gun fire can be heard on at least 11 days near the food distribution
  sites. Bullet casings recovered from patients, and patterns of fire analysed
  by weapons experts, suggest they were Israeli munitions. Palestinians, like
  Nuor, who travel to GHF sites have come under systematic and indiscriminate
  Israeli gunfire. Doctors at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis and the Red Cross
  field hospital in Rafah described treating an unprecedented number of gunshot
  wounds. Almost all responsive patients arriving at Nasser hospital say they
  were shot by the Israeli military while trying to reach a food distribution
  site. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the casualty
  numbers were higher than the combined number of patients they had treated
  during mass-casualty incidents over the entire previous year. In data seen by
  the Guardian, more than 100 of these patients were declared dead on arrival.
  Just last week, Nuor dodged bullets again: “This is how we get flour in Gaza.
  We just want to live – enough is enough.” In one video, an Israeli tank is
  clearly visible, and gunshots can be heard. According to the UN, at least
  1,373 Palestinians have been killed since 27 May while seeking food, with 859
  killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys.
  * * * The bullets on the road A long road runs near the GHF food site in
  northern Rafah, where crowds gather that are so large they can be seen from
  space. It is here that Palestinians trying to get food have come under intense
  fire. One clip from July shows the bullets hitting the sand as a row of
  Palestinians hide. “The gunfire at us was random,” said Mohammed Sleiman Abu
  Lebda, 20, covered in bandages and watching the video on his phone from a
  hospital bed. He said he had been waiting for two hours at the distribution
  site when the Israeli military opened fire on the crowd. The man beside him
  was torn apart, his remains carried away in the bag he had brought to collect
  flour, Lebda said. Of the 21 days of shootings at food distribution sites in
  June in which about 2,000 Palestinians were injured, the Israeli military
  acknowledged opening fire on “suspects” or firing “warning shots” on eight
  occasions, but repeatedly denied targeting civilians. In some of these cases,
  it said it was aware of reports of injuries, and seven cases were “under
  review”. In several cases, the GHF denied there had been “an incident” in the
  immediate vicinity of its sites. The British weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith,
  commenting on the footage in which gunshots pepper the sand, said the action
  was “reckless and irresponsible”, adding: “There is no tactical reason to
  employ small-arms fire to that degree near crowds of non-combatants. It is
  utterly outrageous.” Trevor Ball, an American weapons expert, said: “If this
  is intended as warning shots, it is an unsafe practice. Aiming that close to
  people creates a significant risk of harm or death. Bullets can ricochet, as
  well as have their trajectory affected by the wind and other non-human, as
  well as human, factors. These risks increase with distance.” Images of eight
  bullets removed from people shot near GHF sites were shared with the Guardian
  by doctors from Nasser hospital. The weapons experts analysed two of the
  bullets, using measurements. Ball said: “These bullets are consistent with
  7.62x51mm, a standard IDF [Israel Defense Forces] calibre. The other is .50
  cal, which is used by IDF machine guns, and some Hamas sniper rifles.”
  Cobb-Smith found the same calibres and concurred with Ball. He added it was
  difficult to be specific about the calibre of the other six bullets and
  attribute them without exact measurements, but that they were all
  high-velocity rounds, implying probable military issue. * * * ‘A deadly
  scheme’ Prof Nick Maynard, a consultant surgeon at Oxford university hospital,
  has been visiting Gaza since 2010, and has completed three missions to Nasser
  hospital in Khan Younis since the start of the war. Speaking between
  surgeries, he said that since the GHF sites opened he had predominantly seen
  gunshot wounds. Maynard said he had seen a clustering of similar injuries that
  coincided with the days when food was distributed – between six and 12
  patients coming in with the same injuries – gunshots to the neck, head or
  arms. “The clustering of similar injuries in one day suggests this is a
  targeting activity at particular body parts.” He added: “The other night, we
  admitted four teenage boys, all of whom have been shot in the testicles.”
  Another surgeon at Nasser, Goher Rahbour, described treating an unusually high
  number of mass-casualty incidents, mostly young boys returning from GHF sites:
  “100% of the time, [they said] it’s from the Israeli forces.” In Rafah, the
  60-bed Red Cross field hospital received more than 2,200 patients from more
  than 21 separate mass-casualty incidents – those with more than 30 injured
  people at once – between 27 May, when the GHF sites opened, and 26 June,
  according to hospital admission records seen by the Guardian. * * * ‘They are
  shooting at us’ The Israeli military has claimed Hamas is stealing aid,
  despite the European Commission finding no reports of this. At the end of May,
  the Israeli government promised to lift its siege of Gaza so the GHF could set
  up its centres. Veteran aid groups were denied entry. From the start, the GHF
  distribution was violent, with more than 400 Palestinians injured in the first
  week alone, and more than 30 patients dead on arrival at the ICRC field
  hospital. The first food distribution site was in a zone in west Rafah flagged
  by Israel for evacuation. To collect food, Palestinians had to defy the
  orders. Four days later, in June, sporadic machine-gun fire was heard near the
  GHF site in the early morning hours. “They are shooting at us, I swear,” said
  30-year-old Ameen Khalifa. “We come to get food for our lives, drenched in
  blood. We will die because we’re trying to get food.” About 170 Palestinians
  were injured that day, and 30 killed. Khalifa survived, but not for long. His
  family said he was shot and killed in the same area two days later while
  trying to collect food. “There is no arrangement, no order, no humanitarian
  conditions or anything that respects a human being,” Khalifa’s brother said in
  an interview from a camp for displaced people in Deir al-Balah, in central
  Gaza. Israel’s military admitted firing “warning shots” toward individuals who
  approached its forces, and the GHF said food was handed out that day without
  incident. Ahmad Zeidan, a young boy, had queued to collect food from 7pm the
  previous night with his mother and sister, after receiving word of the
  distribution from the Israeli military. He claimed the Israeli military opened
  fire. His mother was killed. “I advise people not to go [to the food sites].
  Damn this aid … Either we get them while maintaining our dignity, or we don’t
  want them. My mother is gone,” he cried outside Nasser hospital while waiting
  to collect her body. The IDF said its forces had opened fire on a group of
  people they viewed as a threat but denied targeting civilians, adding that it
  was investigating the events. The GHF said the incident occurred in an area
  beyond their secure distribution site and control. Ehab Nuor visited four food
  sites run by the GHF in June and July, and faced gunfire near all four. All of
  these sites were within areas the IDF designated for evacuation, placing
  Palestinians in direct danger. Between 16 and 20 June, as the world focused on
  the war between Israel and Iran, the shootings intensified, injuring 600
  Palestinians near food sites. Videos show floodlights cutting through the dark
  around GHF sites, as an endless stream of Palestinians carry away white flour
  bags and gunshots ring out. Other videos show Palestinians huddled outside the
  perimeter of a GHF site, with gunshots audible. Ball said machine guns were
  widely issued to IDF infantry and mounted on vehicles. By comparison, Hamas
  had some machine guns and captured IDF weapons but these were rarely seen
  except on ceremonial occasions. All survivors and patients treated by doctors
  said they had come under Israeli fire. The Israeli military released a video
  of an IDF spokesperson, Nadav Shoshani, standing near a GHF food site, saying:
  “The idea is to give aid directly to Gazan civilians and bypass Hamas’s hands
  … This is a new solution that brings aid directly to the people of Gaza … They
  have been going in and out peacefully …… They feel safe”. But the evidence
  analysed indicates otherwise. Under international humanitarian law, those
  involved in aid delivery and those backing its operations have a duty to
  ensure humanitarian assistance is provided safely, impartially, and without
  exposing civilians to additional risk, including ensuring safe access.
  Reviewing the Guardian’s findings, Adil Haque, a professor of law at Rutgers
  University, New Jersey, said: “These are grave breaches of the fourth Geneva
  convention as well as war crimes under customary international law and the ICC
  [international criminal court] statute. A soldier may argue that they acted
  reasonably to defend themselves or others. However, it is neither reasonable
  nor proportionate to fire on unarmed civilians at a distance.” Bushra Khalidi,
  Oxfam’s policy lead for the Palestinian territories, who has family members
  trapped in Gaza, believes this is not a humanitarian system. “It’s a deadly
  scheme,” she said. Recent reports indicated that some members of the Israeli
  military had been ordered to open fire on civilians collecting food, while US
  contractors said their colleagues had fired live ammunition at Palestinians
  collecting food in Gaza. An IDF spokesperson told the Guardian: “The IDF
  unequivocally denies the false allegation that it deliberately targets
  Palestinian civilians. The army’s binding orders prohibit forces operating in
  the area from intentionally firing at minors. The IDF operates according to
  international law and upholds the highest ethical standards in its
  operations.” The IDF said it operated near the new distribution areas to
  “facilitate the aid efforts while continuing IDF operational activity in the
  Gaza Strip”, but did not confirm details of the review into incidents of
  civilian harm. It said that after an examination by its southern command,
  “instructions [were] issued to field forces following lessons learned”. It
  added that IDF forces had conducted “learning processes aimed at improving the
  operational response … and minimising possible friction between the population
  and the IDF” and this had been achieved through “the installation of fences,
  signage placement, the opening of additional routes, and other measures”. A
  GHF spokesperson accused the Guardian of aiding a terrorist organisation and
  said: “The false and exaggerated statistics used in these reports seem to
  directly align with the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry … GHF has
  communicated to the UN and other humanitarian groups that we remain flexible
  and willing to sit down and address their concerns to find a path forward to
  collaborate and coordinate to securely deliver the maximum amount of aid
  possible.” Earlier this week, the US ambassador to Israel called the GHF food
  distribution “phenomenal”, dismissing reports of IDF fire killing Palestinians
  as “nonsense”. He announced the possibility of opening 12 more food sites, and
  commencement of a 24 hour operation. For Nuor, there is no respite. He now
  starves in a tent along with his family. Additional reporting by Hoda Osman
