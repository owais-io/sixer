  American Eagle is a US-founded fashion brand that sells jeans, shrunken “baby”
  T-shirts and cropped sweatshirts to predominantly tween and teenage girls. On
  TikTok, users gush about their clothes in outfit-of-the-day posts or shopping
  hauls. This week, however, the brand found itself facing backlash over its new
  campaign, starring the 27-year-old White Lotus and Euphoria actor Sydney
  Sweeney, in which critics are alleging American Eagle uses the language of
  eugenics to try to sell denim. The campaign depicts Sweeney in a denim shirt
  and baggy jeans provocatively posing as a male voice says: “Sydney Sweeney has
  great jeans.” In one now-viral clip, Sweeney is filmed pasting a campaign
  poster on to a billboard. The poster’s text reads “Sydney Sweeney has great
  genes jeans”. In another video that has since been removed from American
  Eagle’s social media channels, Sweeney, who has blond hair and blue eyes,
  says: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining
  traits like hair colour, personality, and even eye colour. My jeans are blue.”
  Critics were quick to point out the implications of the advert’s wordplay. In
  one video that has had more than 3m views, a TikTok user compared it to
  “fascist propaganda,” adding: “a blonde haired, blue-eyed white woman is
  talking about her good genes, like, that is Nazi propaganda”. On the brand’s
  own channels, users are battling it out in the comments section. “It’s giving
  ‘Subtle 1930’s Germany’,” reads one. Another person posted: “The woke crowd
  needs to leave the room.” Even the US senator Ted Cruz has weighed in.
  Reposting a news story on X, he commented: “Wow. Now the crazy Left has come
  out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well ...” According to
  Sophie Gilbert, a staff writer at the Atlantic and author of the book Girl on
  Girl which explores how pop culture is shaped by misogyny: “The slogan ‘Sydney
  Sweeney has good jeans’ obviously winks at the obsession with eugenics that’s
  so prevalent among the modern right.” Dr Sarah Cefai, a senior lecturer in
  gender and cultural studies at Goldsmiths, University of London, agrees.
  “Honestly, what were they thinking, that a white supremacist fantasy has
  permission to be aired so conspicuously?” Aria Halliday, an associate
  professor in gender and women’s studies, African American and Africana studies
  and author of Buy Black: How Black Women Transformed US Pop Culture, isn’t
  surprised by the ad. In recent years, she says, “we have seen an influx of
  media reasserting the beauty of thin, white, blond, and blue-eyed people,”
  with many brands “invested in re-presenting the wholesomeness and sanctity of
  conservative white values.” Critics have also zeroed in on the campaign’s
  focus on Sweeney’s body. In one clip the camera zooms in on the actor’s
  breasts – lingering in a way that Gilbert sees as “leering and unapologetic” –
  as Sweeney says: “My body’s composition is determined by my jeans.” The camera
  then cuts back to Sweeney’s face as she shouts: “Hey, eyes up here!” For
  Cefai, “its sexualisation of the viewer via its voyeurism exposes western
  sexism as a racialised fantasy of whiteness”. American Eagle were approached
  for comment by the Guardian but did not respond. Fashion campaigns are
  notorious for purposefully sparking controversy, but the denim genre is a
  particularly seedy seam. In a 1980s Calvin Klein campaign, a 15-year-old
  Brooke Shields mused: “You know what gets between me and my Calvin’s?
  Nothing.” In 1995, another Calvin Klein ad featured models including Kate Moss
  being filmed in a basement as they undid the top button of their jeans and
  were asked: “Are you nervous?” It was criticised for alluding to child
  exploitation. The American Eagle campaign comes at a time when the US is
  witnessing a cultural shift centering whiteness as well as more conservative
  gender roles, while the Maga movement has been linked with promoting a “soft
  eugenics” way of thinking. In 2025, there are new factors reinforcing old
  stereotypes. For Halliday, the rise of GLP-1 medications for weight loss and
  the record high unemployment of Black women in the US all feed into a wider
  cultural shift that is “about recentering whiteness as what America is and who
  Americans look like.” Some fashion imagery is reflecting this wider
  regression. The blacklisted photographer Terry Richardson is shooting for
  magazines and brands again, while Dov Charney, whose role as CEO of American
  Apparel was terminated after allegations of sexual misconduct, is now making
  content for his new brand that resembles the heavily sexualised noughties
  style of his former brand’s advertising. For American Eagle, a brand whose
  biggest demographic is 15- to 25-year-old females, to tailor their campaign to
  the male gaze seems retrograde, if not downright creepy. However, Jane
  Cunningham, co-author of Brandsplaining: Why Marketing is (Still) Sexist and
  How to Fix It, says many gen Z-ers who are fed a “hypersexualised visual diet”
  on social media may buy into the strategy. “Their attitude may be that they
  are ‘owning’ their sexuality by being overtly sexual in the way they present,”
  she says, pointing to the pop star Sabrina Carpenter as another example of
  someone who has also been accused of catering to the heterosexual male gaze.
  Halliday says that while “Black girls are rarely the target audience for ads,”
  some may still be curious to try the jeans: “the desire to be perceived as
  beautiful is hard to ignore,” she says. Many gen Z-ers may not have
  experienced this genre of advertising, or “intentional provocation as branding
  strategy”, before, says Gilbert, for whom the campaign also reminds her of 90s
  Wonderbra ads with their “Hello Boys” slogan. But maybe they will come to see
  through it. They are “extremely savvy as consumers”, she points out. “They
  have the kind of language and expertise in terms of deconstructing media that
  I couldn’t have dreamed of utilising as a teen during the 1990s. And they know
  when someone is trying to play them, which seems to be happening here. She
  adds: “It all feels like it was cooked up in a conference room to provoke
  maximum controversy and maximum outrage, and to get maximum attention.” And it
  seems – in the business sense at least – to be working. Since the campaign
  launched, American Eagle’s stock has shot up almost 18%. To read the complete
