  This ends our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day. We
  will return on Thursday morning, but here are the latest developments: The US
  senate voted overwhelmingly against two resolutions introduced by Bernie
  Sanders to block arms sales to Israel over its destruction of Gaza, but a
  dozen Democratic senators who voted against the move in April support it now.
  California Democrats who have entered the race to be the state’s next governor
  praised former vice-president Kamala Harris on Wednesday after her decision
  not to run for the office. Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he has
  agreed to a new trade deal with South Korea that will subject imports to a 15%
  tariff rate. South Korean importers will pay no tariffs on US goods they
  purchase. Brown University announced on Wednesday it “reached a voluntary
  agreement with the federal government to restore funding for the University’s
  federally sponsored medical and health sciences research and resolve three
  open reviews assessing Brown’s compliance with federal nondiscrimination
  obligations”. The US Federal Reserve elected to hold its benchmark interest
  rate steady at between 4.25 and 4.5%, a rate it has maintained since the end
  of 2024. Two Trump-appointed officials on the central bank dissented. The
  senate just voted to defeat the second of two resolutions from Bernie Sanders
  to end arms sales to Israel, with 73 votes against and just 24 in favor. The
  Senate just voted overwhelmingly against the first of two resolutions
  introduced by Bernie Sanders on Wednesday to block arms sales to Israel over
  its destruction of Gaza. The measure, SJ Res41, would have stopped the sale of
  tens of thousands of fully automatic assault rifles to Israel. The final tally
  was 70 votes against and 27 in favor. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority
  leader from New York, and Cory Booker, a Democratic senator of New Jersey,
  voted against the measure, but progressives like Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin,
  and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, were joined by moderates including Jon Ossoff of
  Georgia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Dick
  Durbin of Illinois, in supporting the effort to cut off arms supplies to
  Israel. Twelve of the Democrats who voted for the measure previously voted in
  April against a similar resolution, NBC reports. A vote on a second
  resolution, to block the sale of $675.7m in bombs, is now in progress. As the
  Senate begins to vote on resolutions introduced by Bernie Sanders that would
  stop arms sales to Israel, his Democratic colleague, Reverend Raphael Warnock
  of Georgia, said in a statement that he supports the measures. It is wrong to
  starve children and other innocent civilians to death. Yet, whether through
  gross incompetence, woeful indifference, or some combination thereof, that is
  exactly what is happening right now in Gaza under the leadership of Benjamin
  Netanyahu and his government. It is a moral atrocity that cannot abide the
  conscience of those who believe in human dignity, freedom, and human thriving.
  That is why I will vote to support the Joint Resolution of Disapproval put
  before the Senate tonight. I’ve made clear I support the state of Israel and
  its right to defend itself. Today, I urge the state of Israel, the United
  States, and the world to move as quickly as possible to get the people of Gaza
  the same nourishment and care that we would want for our own children. I pray
  for a ceasefire and the return of the hostages home to their families, and
  look forward to resuming the work of securing peace and safety for all those
  in the region. As the Senate continues to debate resolutions introduced by
  Bernie Sanders that would stop arms sales to Israel, ahead of a vote,
  Elizabeth Warren voiced her support for the measures. “Donald Trump promised
  peace in Gaza, but he’s abandoned ceasefire talks while babies starve,” Warren
  wrote on Bluesky. “If Trump is too weak to act, then Congress must step up. No
  more US military support for Netanyahu to wage war in Gaza.” As our colleague
  William Christou reports from Jerusalem, at least 48 Palestinians were killed
  and dozens were wounded on Wednesday while waiting for food at a crossing in
  Gaza, according to a local hospital that received the casualties. The latest
  violence around aid distribution came one day after Donald Trump was praised
  for calling images of starving children there “terrible”, but also endorsed
  the chaotic Israeli-run system for aid distribution, with US support, that has
  led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Palestinians since May. Israel’s ongoing
  military offensive and blockade have led to the “worst-case scenario of
  famine” in the coastal territory of some 2 million Palestinians, according to
  the leading international authority on hunger crises. A breakdown of law and
  order, since Israel insisted on replacing a functioning system of aid
  deliveries run by the United Nations for decades, has seen aid convoys
  overwhelmed by desperate crowds and live ammunition being fired at civilians
  seeking aid by Israeli forces and US contractors. While Israel announced this
  weekend that it would allow more aid into Gaza, the new measures, which
  include daily pauses in the bombardment, as well as airdropped aid and
  humanitarian corridors for UN aid trucks, experienced aid workers have said
  that Israel has intentionally created the starvation crisis, which has seen
  151 Palestinians die of hunger, more than half of whom died in the past month
  alone. On Wednesday night, al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said that the dozens
  who were killed and wounded were among crowds massed at the Zikim crossing,
  the main entry point for humanitarian aid to northern Gaza. Associated Press
  footage showed bodies being ferried away from the scene of the shooting in
  ambulances and wooden carts, as well as crowds of people carrying bags of
  flour. Senator Bernie Sanders just spoke on the Senate floor in support of two
  resolutions that would stop the sale of offensive weapons to Israel over its
  bombardment of the besieged civilian population of Gaza. Ahead of a vote on
  the resolutions scheduled for Wednesday night, Sanders delivered his plea for
  the Senate to block $675.7m in bombs paid for by US taxpayers and the sale of
  tens of thousands of fully automatic assault rifles in front on images of
  starving Palestinian children. He also placed a large stack of papers on his
  desk with the names of 18,500 children who have been killed by Israeli forces
  in Gaza published on Wednesday by the Washington Post. “What the extremist
  Netanyahu government is doing now is not an effort to win a war; there is no
  military purpose in starving thousands and thousands of children,” Sanders
  said. “Let us be clear: this is not an effort to win a war; this is an effort
  to destroy a people.” Sanders added that, by one estimate, 70% of the cost of
  destroying Gaza has been paid for by American taxpayers. He also noted that
  the arms sales clearly violate two US laws: the Foreign Assistance Act and the
  Arms Export Control Act. “Tonight we have the power to act,” Sanders said.
  “The power to force Netanyahu and his extremist government to end this
  slaughter.” The two resolutions introduced by Sanders were supported by
  colleagues including his allies Peter Welch, Vermont’s junior senator, and
  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who has toured the
  country with Sanders for “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies. “The mass starvation in
  Gaza must end,” Welch said in remarks after Sanders spoke. “The forced
  displacement of 2 million Palestinians in Gaza must end.” “It is unthinkable
  that at this moment, when a third of Gaza has not eaten in days, the Senate
  would green light the bombs, guns, and munitions that have already been used
  to kill 60,000 Palestinians,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. “Today, every
  Senator has a choice to make: they can uphold US law by preventing the
  transfer of these weapons, or they can cower to Netanyahu and hand over the
  arms being used to perpetuate a genocide.” In an interview with CNN on Tuesday
  night, Sanders was asked if Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was
  lying when he said there is no starvation in Gaza. “Of course he’s lying,”
  Sanders replied. “He is a disgusting liar.” California Democrats who have
  already entered the race to be the state’s next governor praised former
  vice-president Kamala Harris on Wednesday after her decision not to run for
  the office, despite leading in the polls, made all of their lives a little
  easier. Katie Porter, the former congresswoman who studied consumer law with
  Elizabeth Warren, called Harris “a principled leader” and added: “I’m proud of
  the work we accomplished together on consumer protection during the housing
  crisis and grateful for her service to California and our country.” When
  Harris was California’s attorney general, in 2012, she appointed Porter, a
  bankruptcy law expert, to monitor the state’s $18 billion mortgage settlement
  with major banks in the wake of the financial crisis. Xavier Becerra, who
  succeeded Harris as California’s attorney general and then served as health
  secretary in the Biden-Harris administration, hailed her as “a trailblazing
  leader” who chose to channel her “formidable energy and experience” into
  “other endeavors”. Antonio Villaraigosa, a former Los Angeles mayor, voiced
  his “deep respect for Vice President Kamala Harris and her decades of
  leadership and public service to the people of California and our nation.” In
  hi statement, Villaraigosa, who suggested in May that both Harris and Becerra
  should be asked whether they were part of “a systematic cover-up to keep Joe
  Biden’s mental decline from the public”, strongly hinted that Harris was
  likely passing up on the race to become California’s governor in 2027 so that
  she could run for president again in 2028. “Her decision not to enter the race
  for Governor reflects her continued commitment to serving at the highest
  levels of government”, he wrote. Eleni Kounalakis, California’s current
  lieutenant governor, released a video statement in which she emphasized that
  she is close to Harris. “I got a call from my friend Kamala Harris. I’m very
  honored that she called me before any announcements were made to tell me of
  her plans”, Kounalakis said. “I have so much respect and so much gratitude for
  the vice president’s leadership.” There was no immediate statement from
  another potential candidate, the former Republican real estate developer Rick
  Caruso, who registered as a Democrat and spent $100 million on his
  unsuccessful run for Los Angeles mayor in 2022. Caruso teased a run for
  governor on Tuesday, when he posted Instagram images of himself meeting with
  Willie Brown, and looking at a photo of the California state assembly. Brown,
  who once dated Harris, had suggested in a recent podcast interview that Harris
  might not win a race for governor and talked up the prospects of Caruso
  instead. Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he has agreed to a new trade
  deal with South Korea that will subject imports to a 15% tariff rate. South
  Korean importers will pay no tariffs on US goods they purchase. The new
  arrangement comes seven years after the president negotiated a slightly
  revised version of the existing US-Korea Free Trade Agreement, known as Korus,
  under which almost 95% of the goods traded between the two nations were free
  of tariffs. When that agreement was struck, Trump called the deal “fair and
  reciprocal” and praised it as a win for US auto-makers, since South Korea
  agreed to phase out a 25% tariff on US-made trucks. Trump said that South
  Korea agreed to invest $350bn in the US and purchase $100bn in US energy
  products. Writing on his social media platform, Trump claimed that the new
  agreement meant that “South Korea will be completely OPEN TO TRADE with the
  United States, and that they will accept American product including Cars and
  Trucks, Agriculture, etc.” Brown University announced on Wednesday it “reached
  a voluntary agreement with the federal government to restore funding for the
  University’s federally sponsored medical and health sciences research and
  resolve three open reviews assessing Brown’s compliance with federal
  nondiscrimination obligations”. As part of the agreement, signed by Christina
  H Paxson, the president of Brown, attorney general Pam Bondi, education
  secretary Linda McMahon and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, Brown will
  pay $50m “to state workforce development organizations operating in compliance
  with anti-discrimination laws” over the next 10 years. One provision of the
  agreement stipulates that “Brown shall not maintain programs that promote
  unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or
  similar efforts”. Defining the effort to bring diversity to campuses as a form
  of illegal discrimination against white students is a core element of the
  Trump administration’s ideological war on higher education. “Accordingly,” the
  agreement adds, “Brown will provide a timely report to the United States
  summarizing its compliance with this obligation, including an assurance that
  Brown has acted responsibly to ensure its programs do not promote unlawful DEI
  goals.” Another provision, which might seem to be at odds with the ban on
  promoting diversity, is a commitment from the university to combat
  antisemitism by taking actions “to support a thriving Jewish community,
  research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in Judaic Studies,
  through outreach to Jewish Day School students to provide information about
  applying to Brown, resources for religiously observant Jewish community
  members, renewed partnerships with Israeli academics and national Jewish
  organizations, support for enhanced security at the Brown-RISD Hillel, and a
  convening of alumni, students, and faculty to celebrate 130 years of Jewish
  life at Brown”. The education secretary called the agreement as evidence that
  the Trump administration “is successfully reversing the decades-long
  woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions”. At the start of
  his remarks, before touting what he called the supposed benefits of helping
  Americans to access their medical records on their phones, health secretary
  Robert F Kennedy Jr took a moment to praise the way Donald Trump has changed
  the White House since January. As Kennedy recalled visiting the Oval office
  when his uncle, John F Kennedy, was president, he said that the White House
  had become, over time, drab. He then thanked Trump for making it now “the
  opposite of drab”, a compliment that brought a massive smile to the face of
  the president. Donald Trump just spoke at the start of what’s billed as a
  Making Health Technology Great Again event at the White House, to unveil a new
  private health tracking system that asks Americans to share their personal
  health data and medical records with private tech companies. While privacy
  advocates have raised alarms about the plan, Trump announced that what he
  called “the CMS Digital Health Tech Ecosystem” would “give healthcare
  providers, insurers and software companies the tools they need to empower
  Americans with a 21st Century experience on health.” Before inviting his
  health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to speak, Trump also recited a series
  of boasts about how well things are going under his leadership that have
  become a regular part of his remarks in all settings. One of them was his
  claim that “the king of Saudi Arabia” told him on a recent visit to the Middle
  East that “one year ago, your country was dead, and today yo have the hottest
  country anywhere in the world.” As we noted last week when Trump recited this
  story at an AI summit, Trump was not hosted on his trip by King Salman of
  Saudi Arabia, the 89-year-old monarch who has largely retreated from public
  life and took no part in the lavish ceremonies and meetings Trump attended in
  Riyadh. Instead, Trump met with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the
  kingdom’s de facto ruler, who approved the 2018 murder of the Washington Post
  journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a US intelligence report made public
  three weeks after the end of Trump’s first term. Here are some of the latest
  developments we’re tracking in our continuing live coverage of the second
  Trump administration on Wednesday: The US Federal Reserve elected to hold its
  benchmark interest rate steady at between 4.25 and 4.5%, a rate it has
  maintained since the end of 2024. Two Trump-appointed officials on the central
  bank dissented. Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic
  presidential nominee, announced on Wednesday that she will not run for
  governor of California, or any elected office, “For now” – fueling speculation
  that she could run for the 2028 Democratic nomination. Donald Trump signed an
  executive order which adds a further 40% tariff to Brazilian imports –
  bringing the total to 50%. The order exempts hundreds of products that form a
  large share of Brazilian goods imported by the US, but not coffee. Senate
  minority leader Chuck Schumer outlined a new attempt to force attorney general
  Pam Bondi to release the files related to the federal investigations of
  Jeffrey Epstein. The treasury department announced sanctions against Alexandre
  de Moraes – the Brazil supreme court judge leading the prosecution of former
  Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, for allegedly attempting to launch a coup
  after losing the 2022 Brazilian election. The executive order issued by Donald
  Trump on Wednesday, imposing 50% tariffs on goods imported from Brazil – to
  punish the South American nation for supposedly “persecuting” its former
  president, Jair Bolsonaro, for attempting to stay in power despite losing an
  election – exempts hundreds of products, including certain metals, aircraft
  parts, wood pulp, energy and energy products, and fertilizers. The long list
  of exemptions included in an annex to the order on the White House website
  does not, however, include coffee, one of the main items American companies
  import from Brazil. The Jeffrey Epstein files weren’t the only business of the
  day on Capitol Hill today. Legislation sponsored by Republican Senator Josh
  Hawley of Missouri gained approval from a key committee today. The bill was
  initially named the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and
  Investments (PELOSI) Act, which would bar elected members of Congress from
  buying, owning or selling individual stocks. The bill’s original name takes a
  pointed jab at Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi – who has been criticised for her
  stock holdings. Democrats have since negotiated for the legislation to be
  renamed as the “Honest Act”. In a statement today, Pelosi said: I welcome any
  serious effort to raise ethical standards in public service. The HONEST Act,
  as amended, rightly applies its stock trading ban not only to Members of
  Congress, but now to the President and Vice President as well. I strongly
  support this legislation and look forward to voting for it on the Floor of the
  House. However, since the legislation stipulates that the law doesn’t start
  until an elected official’s new term in office, it exempts Donald Trump and JD
  Vance. Donald Trump signed an executive order which adds a further 40% tariff
  to Brazilian imports – bringing the total to 50%. The White House says that
  the tariffs are a penalty for the Government of Brazil’s politically motivated
  persecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters. The
  administration maintains that these punitive tariffs are part of the
  President’s plans to protect “the national security, foreign policy, and
  economy of the United States from a foreign threat.” This comes after the
  earlier move from the Treasury Department to issue sanctions against the high
  court judge overseeing Bolsonaro’s attempted coup trial. Kamala Harris, the
  former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, announced on
  Wednesday that she will not run for governor of California – a highly
  anticipated decision that leaves the contest to lead the country’s largest
  blue state wide open. In a statement Harris said: For now, my leadership – and
  public service – will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back
  out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the
  nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead
  about my own plans. Powell adds that today’s Federal Reserve meeting was
  “quite good” but there were two dissenters at the meeting. And on the impact
  of tariffs, Powell says there has been “substantial amount of tariff revenue
  collected” each month. But he adds that the process with “probably be slower
  than expected at the beginning, but we never expected it to be fast, and we
  think we have a long way to go.” Powell underscores the Fed’s reasoning: The
  labor market looks solid. Inflation is above target. And even if you look
  through the tariff effects we think it’s still a bit above target. Jerome
  Powell said that while the interest rate will remain steady today, there will
  be two rounds of jobs and inflation data by the time of the next meeting in
  September. He did add, however, that they have made “no decisions about
  September,” but they will be taking that interim information into
  consideration ahead of the next decision. Jerome Powell is outlining the
  Federal Reserve’s decision to keep the interest rate steady. “Our obligation
  is to keep longer term inflation’s inflation expectations well anchored, and
  to prevent a one time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing
  inflation problem,” he said. The US Federal Reserve has elected to hold its
  benchmark interest rate steady at between 4.25 and 4.5%, a rate it has
  maintained since the end of 2024. The divided Federal Reserve voted to keep
  the rate steady despite a barrage of criticism from Trump and dissents from
  two officials. “Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data,
  recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the
  first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market
  conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated,” a press release
  following the decision states. The decision was met with opposition from
  governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, with both advocating for the
  Fed to start easing in acknowledgement that inflation is under control and the
  labor market could weaken soon. This marks the first time since 1993 that
  multiple governors cast no votes on a rate decision. Trump dismissed concerns
  that lowering interest rates could ultimately increase inflation. “Well, if
  that happens, you just raise them,” he said. Trump is taking questions now,
  and is resolute that interest rates must drop. “We’re keeping the rates high,
  and we’re hurting people from buying houses,” he says. Taking another jab, in
  a long series of them, at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, Trump says
  “he’s done a bad job.” The president says that Powell is always “too late”,
  and adds that Powell probably won’t cut the interest rate today for reasons
  that “nobody knows.” President Trump is now in the Roosevelt Room signing a
  bill that provides relief to veterans and their families who have fallen
  behind on mortgage payments. In response to the new congressional map released
  by Texas Republicans today, Democrats in the state and beyond have wasted no
  time rebuking it. The Texas House Democrats said in a statement: These maps
  are a corrupt, racially motivated gerrymander designed to steal the voices of
  Black and Latino Texans so Donald Trump can send five new hand-picked allies
  to Washington. Similarly, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
  (DCCC) said that it anticipates Texas will land itself a lawsuit, and believes
  “the map will get struck down”. They added that they plan “to recruit
  aggressively to unseat every single newly vulnerable Republican who went along
  with this corrupt scheme”. The treasury department announced sanctions today
  against Alexandre de Moraes – the high court judge overseeing the
  investigation into disgraced former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who
  is on trial for allegedly attempting to launch a coup after losing the 2022
  Brazilian election. Earlier this month secretary of state Marco Rubio said on
  social media that he ordered a visa revocation for De Moraes. The US accuses
  De Moraes of “arbitrary pre-trial detentions and suppress freedom of
  expression”. In a statement treasury secretary Scott Bessent added: De Moraes
  is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions
  that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions—including against
  former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today marks the first of three days of
  hearings investigating the plane collision in DC that killed 67 people in
  January. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is holding the
  hearings after an American Airlines passenger jet collided midair with a Black
  Hawk helicopter earlier this year. The crash killed all aboard both aircrafts.
  It is also the US’s deadliest air disaster since November 2001. NTSB chair
  Jennifer Homendy said the three days will be a “fact finding proceeding”, and
  today’s hearing opened with a video animation of where both aircrafts were
  leading up to the collision. At the press conference, when asked about whether
  Democratic senators would be comfortable with redactions, minority leader
  Chuck Schumer said lawmakers “wouldn’t force any agreements that have been
  broken”, but added that he believes “almost everything can come out”. Schumer
  also said that he wants the files to be made available to the public and
  members of Congress, and that Democratic members are working to get some
  Republican colleagues on board to help make the files public. “It should be
  bipartisan,” he said. “But if not, there’s recourse in the courts. This is the
  law.” Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee,
  shared more about how the letter works, and what it demands. “We are using
  very unique statutory authority that is granted only to our committee, to
  homeland security and government affairs. The statute that we are invoking
  requires the administration to hand over documents … requested by any five
  members of the Senate committee,” Peters said. “This letter demands that the
  justice department produce documents that attorney general Pam Bondi and FBI
  Director Kash Patel have publicly already confirmed they have in their
  possession. We all know in fact that the attorney general said, quote, she
  said they’re sitting on her desk. It should be pretty easy to turn over
  documents that are sitting on the attorney general’s desk.” At the Capitol,
  Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is outlining his attempt to force
  attorney general Pam Bondi to release the files related to the investigation
  of disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. “We’re
  invoking federal law and using our authority as a check on the executive to
  compel transparency,” Schumer said. “Today’s letter matters. It’s not a stunt,
  it’s not symbolic, it’s a formal exercise of congressional power under federal
  law, and we expect an answer from DoJ by August the 15th. That’s what
  accountability looks like. This is what oversight looks like, and this is what
  keeping your promises to the American people look like.” He noted that both
  Bondi and Donald Trump had previously said they want the case file’s released:
  This is not complicated. After promising full transparency for years, every
  single time Trump, his administration, Republican leaders have had a chance to
  be transparent about the Epstein files, they’ve chosen to hide. The evasions,
  the delays, the excuses, they are not just odd, they’re alarming. It begs the
  question, if there’s nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness? Trump should
  stop hiding from the truth, he should stop hiding from the American people.
  California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom has indicated he may push to
  redraw his state’s congressional maps if Texas Republicans approve new maps
  that could net the GOP five more House seats. Writing on X after Texas
  Republicans released their proposal for redistricting the state’s House seats,
  Newsom said: Donald Trump asks for 5 seats and Greg Abbott automatically bends
  the knee. The 2026 election is being rigged. California won’t sit back and
  watch this happen. If California Democrats want to redraw their congressional
  maps in the party’s favor, they will first have to ask voters to cancel a
  constitutional amendment that created an independent redistricting commission
  – potentially a tall ask. Top Senate Democrats will hold a press conference in
  a few minutes about their attempt to use a rarely-invoked law to force
  attorney general Pam Bondi to hand over the Epstein files. Senate minority
  leader Chuck Schumer is due to speak, as well as Gary Peters, the ranking
  member of the homeland security committee, and other Democrats on the panel.
  We will let you know what they have to say. Here’s a rundown of the news so
  far today: We’re preparing for an interest-rate decision from the Federal
  Reserve at 2pm, and a press conference with chair Jerome Powell 30 minutes
  after the announcement. It comes as Donald Trump continued to urge Powell to
  cut the rate on social media. Trump also announced a 25% tariff on India,
  writing on Truth Social that the US has done “relatively little business” with
  the country. Trump also said that India would be subject to a further penalty
  for buying substantial amounts of Russian military equipment and energy.
  Senate Democrats will at noon hold a press conference after writing a letter
  to attorney general Pam Bondi to release the full and unredacted Epstein
  files. They’re invoking a rare and obscure law known as “rule of five”, which
  states that a government agency must provide information if five or more
  Senate committee members request it. Beyond Washington, Texas Republicans
  released a proposed new congressional map for the state. This comes at the
  urging of Trump, and much earlier than usual. Typically, the state redraws
  their map every 10 years. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries is talking
  with Democratic legislators in Texas amid the redistricting battle ensuing in
  the state. He’s expected to hold a press conference tomorrow as Democrats try
  to stave off a rewritten map that would cost them a House majority. Texas
  Republicans have released their new proposed congressional map today. It could
  add up to five Republican seats if passed. Donald Trump has pressured
  lawmakers in the state to redraw the map in order to protect the slim majority
  that Republicans hold in the House as the 2026 midterms loom. Currently,
  Republicans hold 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats, while Democrats hold
  12. Democratic strongholds like California and Maryland have threatened to
  redraw their maps in response. Democratic Texas congressman Greg Casar, chair
  of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has responded to a proposed
  redistricting map published by Punchbowl News. He issued the following
  statement: Merging the 35th and the 37th districts is illegal voter
  suppression of Black and Latino Central Texans. By merging our Central Texas
  districts, Trump wants to commit yet another crime— this time, against Texas
  voters and against Martin Luther King’s Voting Rights Act of 1965. United, we
  will fight back with everything we’ve got. While Senate Democrats are on
  Capitol Hill and pressing for the Epstein files release, House Democratic
  leader Hakeem Jeffries is in Austin, Texas, for closed-door meetings with
  state Democrats, according to Politico. This comes as Donald Trump pushes
  Republican legislators in Texas to redraw their congressional district map
  earlier than usual. Normally, Texas would reconfigure its map every 10 years –
  aligned with the census. Per Politico, Jeffries will hold a press conference
  in Texas tomorrow, along with a number of media appearances across cable TV.
  Later today we’ll find out the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decision, and
  we can also expect to hear from chair Jerome Powell shortly after. Earlier
  today, Donald Trump pushed again for the Fed to lower the interest rate on
  Truth Social: “No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!”
  Announcing the tariff on Truth Social today, Donald Trump said that “while
  India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business
  with them.” Trump added that India will also pay a “penalty” for their role as
  a substantial buyer of Russian military equipment and energy. “At a time when
  everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE,” he wrote. Our
  colleagues are providing live updates here. The US GDP grew at a faster rate
  than expected this quarter – 3%. That’s higher than the 2.3% Dow Jones
  estimate for this April to June period. For more up-to-date news, follow our
  Business Live blog here. Transcripts of the grand jury proceedings that led to
  the sex trafficking indictments of the sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his
  accomplice, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, include the testimony of just
  two law enforcement witnesses, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has said, as it
  argues for the documents’ release. Top DoJ officials disclosed in a filing
  late on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court that separate grand juries convened
  to consider the criminal investigations of Epstein and Maxwell, and had heard
  from only two witnesses. The revelation was made in the course of court
  wrangling over whether the transcripts of the proceedings should be unsealed,
  amid the continuing furor over the Epstein scandal which has roiled Donald
  Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is urging the two federal judges
  who presided over the Epstein and Maxwell grand juries, Richard Berman and
  Paul Engelmayer, to release the testimony, in an attempt to calm the uproar.
  The Trump administration has come under intense pressure from the president’s
  own base of supporters who were infuriated by the DoJ’s decision not to
  release any additional Epstein files about the late, disgraced financier’s
  crimes involving the sex trafficking of girls. The decision jarred with the
  previous stance of senior administration figures, including Trump himself and
  the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who had hyped the expected release of more
  details of the New York financier’s businesses, travels and associations,
  including a possible list of his financial clients, which all further stoked
  conspiracies around the well-connected Epstein. Tuesday’s submission states
  that the grand jury tasked with considering the criminal case against Epstein
  heard only from an FBI agent when it met in June and July, 2019. A similar
  grand jury for Maxwell heard from the same FBI agent and a New York Police
  Department detective when it met in June and July, 2020 and in March, 2021.
  The memorandum was signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney for the southern
  district of New York, and included the names of Bondi and deputy attorney
  general Todd Blanche. Epstein took his own life in a federal jail in August
  2019, weeks after his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges, officials
  say, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories
  because of his and Maxwell’s links to famous people, such as royals,
  presidents and billionaires, including Trump. Maxwell is serving a 20-year
  prison sentence for conspiring with Epstein in the sexual trafficking of
  minors. She was convicted in December 2021 on charges that she lured teenage
  girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last week, she sat for two sets of
  interviews with Justice Department officials, including Blanche, in Florida,
  where she is serving her time in a federal prison, and answered questions
  “about 100 different people,” her attorney said. Trump has denied prior
  knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and claimed he had cut off their relationship
  long ago. But he faces ongoing questions about the Epstein case. On Tuesday
  Trump spoke about connections between Epstein and the president’s Mar-a-Lago
  club in Florida. He claimed he evicted the financier from the resort because
  Epstein “stole” young female staffers from him, including Virginia Giuffre who
  went on to be a key witness against Epstein and Maxwell. Giuffre died in
  April. Maxwell has offered to testify before Congress but with conditions,
  including being granted immunity. Her lawyer has written to the House
  committee which has subpoenaed her saying that a deposition without immunity
  would be a “non-starter”. The DoJ memorandum says unsealing the transcripts is
  “consistent with increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.”
  On Capitol Hill today, Senate Democrats – led by minority leader Chuck Schumer
  – will hold a press conference at 12pm ET to discuss their plans to push the
  justice department to release the full and un-redacted Epstein files.
  Democrats are using a rare and little-known law, known colloquially as the
  “rule of five”, which requires government agencies to provide relevant
  information if at least five members of the committee request it. In this
  case, all Democrats on the homeland security and governmental affairs
  committee signed a letter to attorney general Pam Bondi yesterday. Donald
  Trump is back at the White House today. We’ll see him at 4pm EST for remarks,
  and he’s expected to sign a bill earlier in the day. It’s currently unclear
  what that piece of legislation is. Meanwhile on social media, Trump has said
  that the 1 August reciprocal tariff deadline will not be extended. He wrote:
  The August first deadline is the August first deadline - it stands strong, and
  will not be extended. A big day for America!!! Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry
  Peskov said on Wednesday that Russia had developed an “immunity” to sanctions,
  Reuters reports. The comments came after Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would
  start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia “10 days from today” if
  Moscow did not make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Peskov told
  reporters: We have been living under a huge number of sanctions for quite a
  long time, our economy operates under a huge number of restrictions.
  Therefore, of course, we have already developed a certain immunity in this
  regard, and we continue to note all statements that come from President Trump,
  from other international representatives on this matter. The Kremlin said on
  Wednesday it continued to take into account all statements made by US
  president Donald Trump, but Russia had acquired immunity to sanctions because
  it had lived under a huge number of them for a long time, Reuters reports.
  Trump said on Tuesday that the United States would start imposing tariffs and
  other measures on Russia in 10 days if Moscow showed no progress toward ending
  its more than three-year-long war in Ukraine. Jessica Geen lives in London and

  Medicare and Medicaid, turn 60 years old on Wednesday – a birthday that will
  be celebrated only weeks after Republicans enacted the largest cuts to
  healthcare in the nation’s history. Passed in the civil rights era, the sister
  health insurance programs served as tools for the Democratic president Lyndon
  Johnson to desegregate American healthcare and fight poverty. “This is an
  infamous day for the US, which already has the most abysmal healthcare system
  among our peer nations,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health
  law at Georgetown Law. “Now, in order to give tax relief and spend more on
  defense, we’re kicking off our most needy citizens from life-saving care.” In
  a health system defined by a patchwork of public and private coverage,
  Medicare and Medicaid have stood for 60 years as the civil rights era’s health
  legacy – their history more often marked by expansion than contraction, even
  amid decades of attacks from conservatives. That history took a sharp right
  turn on the Fourth of July, when Donald Trump signed a Republican budget law
  that will cut $1tn from Medicaid beginning in 2026. “It’s really
  unconscionable these cuts,” said David Lipschutz, co-director of the Center
  for Medicare Advocacy, speaking about both programs. “The magnitude, the
  scope, the targeting of certain lawfully present immigrants, the added
  requirements and burdens for people with Medicaid – specifically designed to
  purge the roles of people who would otherwise be eligible.” You can read more
  of Jessica Geen’s explainer here: Trump’s ‘unconscionable cuts’ to Medicaid
  and Medicare were decades in the making The Justice Department says in support
  of its request to unseal grand jury transcripts of proceedings that led to the
  sex trafficking indictments of New York financier and sex abuser Jeffrey
  Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell that they include the
  testimony of just two law enforcement witnesses, reports the Associated Press
  (AP). In a filing late on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, officials
  describe the grand jury witnesses in a memorandum in response to a call from
  judges presiding over both cases to provide more details about their request
  earlier this month. Judges would have to approve any request to unseal
  records. The papers filed on Tuesday cite a 1997 second US Circuit court of
  appeals ruling that said judges have wide discretion and public interest alone
  can justify releasing grand jury information. The Epstein grand jury heard
  only from an FBI agent when it met in June and July of 2019, while the Maxwell
  grand jury heard from the same FBI agent and a New York police department
  detective when it met in June and July of 2020 and in March of 2021, according
  to the submission. The memorandum was signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney for
  the Southern District of New York, and included the names of attorney general
  Pam Bondi and Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche. After the request to
  unseal grand jury records, two former prosecutors in Manhattan told the AP the
  transcripts would be relatively short and contain only the testimony of law
  enforcement witnesses talking about evidence that tracks information in the
  indictments. In its filing on Tuesday, the Justice Department further dampened
  expectations the grand jury transcripts would contain new revelations when it
  said “certain aspects and subject matters” contained in them became public
  during Maxwell’s trial. Humana on Wednesday raised its annual profit forecast,
  as the US health insurer bets on its efforts to rein in higher medical costs
  that have plagued the sector, Reuters reports. The company is a top provider
  of Medicare Advantage plans under which the US government pays private
  insurers a set rate to manage healthcare for people aged 65 and older, and
  those with disabilities. The industry has been battling with persistently high
  costs for the last two years due to increased use of healthcare services
  across the government-backed plans. However, Humana said its medical costs
  were in line with its expectations. The company now expects full-year profit
  to be about $17 per share, compared with its previous estimate of about
  $16.25. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $16.38 per share.

  become so disgusted with Tesla since Elon Musk’s rightward turn that they are
  now not only far less likely to purchase the car brand but also less willing
  to buy any type of electric car, new research has found. The popularity of
  Tesla among liberal-minded Americans has plummeted since Musk, Tesla’s chief
  executive and the world’s richest person, allied himself with Donald Trump and
  helped propel the president to election victory last year. While liberals
  reported mostly positive intentions around buying an electric car in August
  2023, their overall support for EVs eroded in the wake of a collapse in their
  opinion of Teslas, according to the new study, which polled Americans on an
  array of environmental actions. By the latest poll, taken in March as Musk was
  gutting the federal workforce in his role as Trump’s top adviser after
  delivering what appeared to be a Nazi salute, the intention to buy any EV
  among liberals slipped into negative territory. Alexandra Flores, a
  psychologist at Williams College and lead author of the study, published in
  Nature, said: The suspicion is that Elon Musk became so synonymous with EVs in
  the US that perceptions of him affected the entire class of vehicles. This
  made them way less appealing to liberals – he really dragged down perceptions
  of EVs in general. It’s definitely unusual to have a chief executive have an
  impact on a whole class of products like this. You can read more of Oliver
  Milman’s report here: Elon Musk is turning US liberals off not just Tesla but
  electric vehicles in general A cryptocurrency working group formed by
  president Donald Trump will release a report on Wednesday that is expected to
  outline the administration’s stances on tokenization and market-defining
  crypto legislation, among other issues critically important to the digital
  asset industry, Reuters reports. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump
  ordered the creation of a crypto working group tasked with proposing new
  regulations, making good on his campaign promise to overhaul US crypto policy.
  Wednesday’s report is a culmination of the taskforce’s work so far and its
  first public findings. In line with Trump’s January executive order, it will
  lay out what rules and laws should be enacted to advance the policy goals of
  the pro-crypto White House. Those include making sure that the Securities and
  Exchange Commission has a framework in place for firms to offer
  blockchain-based stocks and bonds, according to one person familiar with the
  discussions. The report is also expected to discuss the administration’s
  wishlist for legislation Congress is debating to create broad regulatory
  guidelines for cryptocurrency, according to a second person familiar with the
  report. The working group led by Trump official Bo Hines is composed of
  several administration officials including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent,
  SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Director of the Office of Management and Budget
  Russell Vought. The White House, Treasury Department and the SEC did not
  immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. Hello and welcome
  back to our coverage of US politics. Donald Trump’s administration urged two
  judges on Tuesday night to release testimony heard by the grand juries that
  indicted the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine
  Maxwell on sex trafficking charges as the president seeks to calm an uproar
  over his administration’s handling of the matter. The Justice Department first
  sought court permission on 18 July to make public transcripts of the
  confidential testimony given by witnesses years ago in the two cases, but
  Manhattan-based US district judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer asked
  the government to flesh out the legal bases for the requests. The US president
  also spoke about Jeffrey Epstein and his links to the president’s Mar-a-Lago
  club, saying that the late sex offender “stole” Virginia Giuffre and other
  young female staffers when he hired them while they were working at the
  Florida country club. Trump, who has faced an outcry over his administration’s
  refusal to release more records about Epstein after promises of transparency,
  made the comments on Air Force One while returning from a trip to Scotland. In
  other developments: In Hawaii, waves of up to 1.7 metres (5.5 feet) affected
  the islands before the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reduced its warning
  level for the state about 08.50 GMT, saying no major tsunami was expected
  after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Russia. Coastal residents
  were earlier told to get to high ground or the fourth floor or above of
  buildings, and the US Coast Guard ordered ships out of harbours. Tsunami waves
  of nearly half a metre were observed as far as California, with smaller ones
  reaching Canada’s province of British Columbia. Indian exporters are bracing
  for higher US tariffs to kick in as prospects dim for an interim trade deal
  between New Delhi and Washington before the 1 August deadline. On Tuesday, US
  president Donald Trump said India could face a 20-25% rate since a deal had
  not been finalised, although he added that a final levy was yet to be decided.
  A group of global civil society organizations have placed the US on a
  watchlist for urgent concern over the health of its civic society, alongside
  Turkey, Serbia, El Salvador, Indonesia and Kenya. On Wednesday, a new report
  released by the non-profit Civicus placed the US on its watchlist after
  “sustained attacks on civic freedoms” across the country, according to the
  group. President Trump said on Tuesday he might skip the upcoming Group of 20
  (G20) leaders’ summit in South Africa in November and send someone else to
  represent the United States, citing his disapproval of South African policies.
  “I think maybe I’ll send somebody else because I’ve had a lot of problems with
  South Africa. They have some very bad policies,” Trump told reporters aboard
  Air Force One. The United States has repatriated an American child from a
  large camp in northeastern Syria. The camp houses tens of thousands of people
  with alleged ties to the Islamic State group. The state department announced
  the move on Wednesday. The al-Hawl Camp holds about 30,000 people from 70
  countries, mostly families and supporters of IS fighters. Vinay Prasad, the US
  Food and Drug Administration’s chief medical and science officer, has left the
  health regulator, the US Department of Health and Human Services, which
  oversees the FDA, said on Tuesday, confirming an earlier news report. The US
  Senate on Tuesday confirmed Emil Bove, a top justice department official and
  former defense attorney for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on a federal
  appeals court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for ignoring
  court orders. The vote broke nearly along party lines, with 50 Republican
  senators voting for his confirmation to a seat on the third circuit court of
  appeals overseeing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin
  Islands.

This ends our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day. We will return on Thursday morning, but here are the latest developments: The US senate voted overwhelmingly against two resolutions introduced by Bernie Sanders to block arms sales to Israel over its destruction of Gaza, but a dozen Democratic senators who voted against the move in April support it now. California Democrats who have entered the race to be the state’s next governor praised former vice-president Kamala Harris on Wednesday after her decision not to run for the office. Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he has agreed to a new trade deal with South Korea that will subject imports to a 15% tariff rate. South Korean importers will pay no tariffs on US goods they purchase. Brown University announced on Wednesday it “reached a voluntary agreement with the federal government to restore funding for the University’s federally sponsored medical and health sciences research and resolve three open reviews assessing Brown’s compliance with federal nondiscrimination obligations”. The US Federal Reserve elected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at between 4.25 and 4.5%, a rate it has maintained since the end of 2024. Two Trump-appointed officials on the central bank dissented. The senate just voted to defeat the second of two resolutions from Bernie Sanders to end arms sales to Israel, with 73 votes against and just 24 in favor. The Senate just voted overwhelmingly against the first of two resolutions introduced by Bernie Sanders on Wednesday to block arms sales to Israel over its destruction of Gaza. The measure, SJ Res41, would have stopped the sale of tens of thousands of fully automatic assault rifles to Israel. The final tally was 70 votes against and 27 in favor. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, and Cory Booker, a Democratic senator of New Jersey, voted against the measure, but progressives like Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, were joined by moderates including Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, in supporting the effort to cut off arms supplies to Israel. Twelve of the Democrats who voted for the measure previously voted in April against a similar resolution, NBC reports. A vote on a second resolution, to block the sale of $675.7m in bombs, is now in progress. As the Senate begins to vote on resolutions introduced by Bernie Sanders that would stop arms sales to Israel, his Democratic colleague, Reverend Raphael Warnock of Georgia, said in a statement that he supports the measures. It is wrong to starve children and other innocent civilians to death. Yet, whether through gross incompetence, woeful indifference, or some combination thereof, that is exactly what is happening right now in Gaza under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu and his government. It is a moral atrocity that cannot abide the conscience of those who believe in human dignity, freedom, and human thriving. That is why I will vote to support the Joint Resolution of Disapproval put before the Senate tonight. I’ve made clear I support the state of Israel and its right to defend itself. Today, I urge the state of Israel, the United States, and the world to move as quickly as possible to get the people of Gaza the same nourishment and care that we would want for our own children. I pray for a ceasefire and the return of the hostages home to their families, and look forward to resuming the work of securing peace and safety for all those in the region. As the Senate continues to debate resolutions introduced by Bernie Sanders that would stop arms sales to Israel, ahead of a vote, Elizabeth Warren voiced her support for the measures. “Donald Trump promised peace in Gaza, but he’s abandoned ceasefire talks while babies starve,” Warren wrote on Bluesky. “If Trump is too weak to act, then Congress must step up. No more US military support for Netanyahu to wage war in Gaza.” As our colleague William Christou reports from Jerusalem, at least 48 Palestinians were killed and dozens were wounded on Wednesday while waiting for food at a crossing in Gaza, according to a local hospital that received the casualties. The latest violence around aid distribution came one day after Donald Trump was praised for calling images of starving children there “terrible”, but also endorsed the chaotic Israeli-run system for aid distribution, with US support, that has led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Palestinians since May. Israel’s ongoing military offensive and blockade have led to the “worst-case scenario of famine” in the coastal territory of some 2 million Palestinians, according to the leading international authority on hunger crises. A breakdown of law and order, since Israel insisted on replacing a functioning system of aid deliveries run by the United Nations for decades, has seen aid convoys overwhelmed by desperate crowds and live ammunition being fired at civilians seeking aid by Israeli forces and US contractors. While Israel announced this weekend that it would allow more aid into Gaza, the new measures, which include daily pauses in the bombardment, as well as airdropped aid and humanitarian corridors for UN aid trucks, experienced aid workers have said that Israel has intentionally created the starvation crisis, which has seen 151 Palestinians die of hunger, more than half of whom died in the past month alone. On Wednesday night, al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said that the dozens who were killed and wounded were among crowds massed at the Zikim crossing, the main entry point for humanitarian aid to northern Gaza. Associated Press footage showed bodies being ferried away from the scene of the shooting in ambulances and wooden carts, as well as crowds of people carrying bags of flour. Senator Bernie Sanders just spoke on the Senate floor in support of two resolutions that would stop the sale of offensive weapons to Israel over its bombardment of the besieged civilian population of Gaza. Ahead of a vote on the resolutions scheduled for Wednesday night, Sanders delivered his plea for the Senate to block $675.7m in bombs paid for by US taxpayers and the sale of tens of thousands of fully automatic assault rifles in front on images of starving Palestinian children. He also placed a large stack of papers on his desk with the names of 18,500 children who have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza published on Wednesday by the Washington Post. “What the extremist Netanyahu government is doing now is not an effort to win a war; there is no military purpose in starving thousands and thousands of children,” Sanders said. “Let us be clear: this is not an effort to win a war; this is an effort to destroy a people.” Sanders added that, by one estimate, 70% of the cost of destroying Gaza has been paid for by American taxpayers. He also noted that the arms sales clearly violate two US laws: the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act. “Tonight we have the power to act,” Sanders said. “The power to force Netanyahu and his extremist government to end this slaughter.” The two resolutions introduced by Sanders were supported by colleagues including his allies Peter Welch, Vermont’s junior senator, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who has toured the country with Sanders for “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies. “The mass starvation in Gaza must end,” Welch said in remarks after Sanders spoke. “The forced displacement of 2 million Palestinians in Gaza must end.” “It is unthinkable that at this moment, when a third of Gaza has not eaten in days, the Senate would green light the bombs, guns, and munitions that have already been used to kill 60,000 Palestinians,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. “Today, every Senator has a choice to make: they can uphold US law by preventing the transfer of these weapons, or they can cower to Netanyahu and hand over the arms being used to perpetuate a genocide.” In an interview with CNN on Tuesday night, Sanders was asked if Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was lying when he said there is no starvation in Gaza. “Of course he’s lying,” Sanders replied. “He is a disgusting liar.” California Democrats who have already entered the race to be the state’s next governor praised former vice-president Kamala Harris on Wednesday after her decision not to run for the office, despite leading in the polls, made all of their lives a little easier. Katie Porter, the former congresswoman who studied consumer law with Elizabeth Warren, called Harris “a principled leader” and added: “I’m proud of the work we accomplished together on consumer protection during the housing crisis and grateful for her service to California and our country.” When Harris was California’s attorney general, in 2012, she appointed Porter, a bankruptcy law expert, to monitor the state’s $18 billion mortgage settlement with major banks in the wake of the financial crisis. Xavier Becerra, who succeeded Harris as California’s attorney general and then served as health secretary in the Biden-Harris administration, hailed her as “a trailblazing leader” who chose to channel her “formidable energy and experience” into “other endeavors”. Antonio Villaraigosa, a former Los Angeles mayor, voiced his “deep respect for Vice President Kamala Harris and her decades of leadership and public service to the people of California and our nation.” In hi statement, Villaraigosa, who suggested in May that both Harris and Becerra should be asked whether they were part of “a systematic cover-up to keep Joe Biden’s mental decline from the public”, strongly hinted that Harris was likely passing up on the race to become California’s governor in 2027 so that she could run for president again in 2028. “Her decision not to enter the race for Governor reflects her continued commitment to serving at the highest levels of government”, he wrote. Eleni Kounalakis, California’s current lieutenant governor, released a video statement in which she emphasized that she is close to Harris. “I got a call from my friend Kamala Harris. I’m very honored that she called me before any announcements were made to tell me of her plans”, Kounalakis said. “I have so much respect and so much gratitude for the vice president’s leadership.” There was no immediate statement from another potential candidate, the former Republican real estate developer Rick Caruso, who registered as a Democrat and spent $100 million on his unsuccessful run for Los Angeles mayor in 2022. Caruso teased a run for governor on Tuesday, when he posted Instagram images of himself meeting with Willie Brown, and looking at a photo of the California state assembly. Brown, who once dated Harris, had suggested in a recent podcast interview that Harris might not win a race for governor and talked up the prospects of Caruso instead. Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he has agreed to a new trade deal with South Korea that will subject imports to a 15% tariff rate. South Korean importers will pay no tariffs on US goods they purchase. The new arrangement comes seven years after the president negotiated a slightly revised version of the existing US-Korea Free Trade Agreement, known as Korus, under which almost 95% of the goods traded between the two nations were free of tariffs. When that agreement was struck, Trump called the deal “fair and reciprocal” and praised it as a win for US auto-makers, since South Korea agreed to phase out a 25% tariff on US-made trucks. Trump said that South Korea agreed to invest $350bn in the US and purchase $100bn in US energy products. Writing on his social media platform, Trump claimed that the new agreement meant that “South Korea will be completely OPEN TO TRADE with the United States, and that they will accept American product including Cars and Trucks, Agriculture, etc.” Brown University announced on Wednesday it “reached a voluntary agreement with the federal government to restore funding for the University’s federally sponsored medical and health sciences research and resolve three open reviews assessing Brown’s compliance with federal nondiscrimination obligations”. As part of the agreement, signed by Christina H Paxson, the president of Brown, attorney general Pam Bondi, education secretary Linda McMahon and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, Brown will pay $50m “to state workforce development organizations operating in compliance with anti-discrimination laws” over the next 10 years. One provision of the agreement stipulates that “Brown shall not maintain programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts”. Defining the effort to bring diversity to campuses as a form of illegal discrimination against white students is a core element of the Trump administration’s ideological war on higher education. “Accordingly,” the agreement adds, “Brown will provide a timely report to the United States summarizing its compliance with this obligation, including an assurance that Brown has acted responsibly to ensure its programs do not promote unlawful DEI goals.” Another provision, which might seem to be at odds with the ban on promoting diversity, is a commitment from the university to combat antisemitism by taking actions “to support a thriving Jewish community, research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in Judaic Studies, through outreach to Jewish Day School students to provide information about applying to Brown, resources for religiously observant Jewish community members, renewed partnerships with Israeli academics and national Jewish organizations, support for enhanced security at the Brown-RISD Hillel, and a convening of alumni, students, and faculty to celebrate 130 years of Jewish life at Brown”. The education secretary called the agreement as evidence that the Trump administration “is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions”. At the start of his remarks, before touting what he called the supposed benefits of helping Americans to access their medical records on their phones, health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr took a moment to praise the way Donald Trump has changed the White House since January. As Kennedy recalled visiting the Oval office when his uncle, John F Kennedy, was president, he said that the White House had become, over time, drab. He then thanked Trump for making it now “the opposite of drab”, a compliment that brought a massive smile to the face of the president. Donald Trump just spoke at the start of what’s billed as a Making Health Technology Great Again event at the White House, to unveil a new private health tracking system that asks Americans to share their personal health data and medical records with private tech companies. While privacy advocates have raised alarms about the plan, Trump announced that what he called “the CMS Digital Health Tech Ecosystem” would “give healthcare providers, insurers and software companies the tools they need to empower Americans with a 21st Century experience on health.” Before inviting his health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to speak, Trump also recited a series of boasts about how well things are going under his leadership that have become a regular part of his remarks in all settings. One of them was his claim that “the king of Saudi Arabia” told him on a recent visit to the Middle East that “one year ago, your country was dead, and today yo have the hottest country anywhere in the world.” As we noted last week when Trump recited this story at an AI summit, Trump was not hosted on his trip by King Salman of Saudi Arabia, the 89-year-old monarch who has largely retreated from public life and took no part in the lavish ceremonies and meetings Trump attended in Riyadh. Instead, Trump met with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, who approved the 2018 murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a US intelligence report made public three weeks after the end of Trump’s first term. Here are some of the latest developments we’re tracking in our continuing live coverage of the second Trump administration on Wednesday: The US Federal Reserve elected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at between 4.25 and 4.5%, a rate it has maintained since the end of 2024. Two Trump-appointed officials on the central bank dissented. Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, announced on Wednesday that she will not run for governor of California, or any elected office, “For now” – fueling speculation that she could run for the 2028 Democratic nomination. Donald Trump signed an executive order which adds a further 40% tariff to Brazilian imports – bringing the total to 50%. The order exempts hundreds of products that form a large share of Brazilian goods imported by the US, but not coffee. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer outlined a new attempt to force attorney general Pam Bondi to release the files related to the federal investigations of Jeffrey Epstein. The treasury department announced sanctions against Alexandre de Moraes – the Brazil supreme court judge leading the prosecution of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, for allegedly attempting to launch a coup after losing the 2022 Brazilian election. The executive order issued by Donald Trump on Wednesday, imposing 50% tariffs on goods imported from Brazil – to punish the South American nation for supposedly “persecuting” its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for attempting to stay in power despite losing an election – exempts hundreds of products, including certain metals, aircraft parts, wood pulp, energy and energy products, and fertilizers. The long list of exemptions included in an annex to the order on the White House website does not, however, include coffee, one of the main items American companies import from Brazil. The Jeffrey Epstein files weren’t the only business of the day on Capitol Hill today. Legislation sponsored by Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri gained approval from a key committee today. The bill was initially named the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, which would bar elected members of Congress from buying, owning or selling individual stocks. The bill’s original name takes a pointed jab at Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi – who has been criticised for her stock holdings. Democrats have since negotiated for the legislation to be renamed as the “Honest Act”. In a statement today, Pelosi said: I welcome any serious effort to raise ethical standards in public service. The HONEST Act, as amended, rightly applies its stock trading ban not only to Members of Congress, but now to the President and Vice President as well. I strongly support this legislation and look forward to voting for it on the Floor of the House. However, since the legislation stipulates that the law doesn’t start until an elected official’s new term in office, it exempts Donald Trump and JD Vance. Donald Trump signed an executive order which adds a further 40% tariff to Brazilian imports – bringing the total to 50%. The White House says that the tariffs are a penalty for the Government of Brazil’s politically motivated persecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and his supporters. The administration maintains that these punitive tariffs are part of the President’s plans to protect “the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States from a foreign threat.” This comes after the earlier move from the Treasury Department to issue sanctions against the high court judge overseeing Bolsonaro’s attempted coup trial. Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, announced on Wednesday that she will not run for governor of California – a highly anticipated decision that leaves the contest to lead the country’s largest blue state wide open. In a statement Harris said: For now, my leadership – and public service – will not be in elected office. I look forward to getting back out and listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about my own plans. Powell adds that today’s Federal Reserve meeting was “quite good” but there were two dissenters at the meeting. And on the impact of tariffs, Powell says there has been “substantial amount of tariff revenue collected” each month. But he adds that the process with “probably be slower than expected at the beginning, but we never expected it to be fast, and we think we have a long way to go.” Powell underscores the Fed’s reasoning: The labor market looks solid. Inflation is above target. And even if you look through the tariff effects we think it’s still a bit above target. Jerome Powell said that while the interest rate will remain steady today, there will be two rounds of jobs and inflation data by the time of the next meeting in September. He did add, however, that they have made “no decisions about September,” but they will be taking that interim information into consideration ahead of the next decision. Jerome Powell is outlining the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep the interest rate steady. “Our obligation is to keep longer term inflation’s inflation expectations well anchored, and to prevent a one time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem,” he said. The US Federal Reserve has elected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at between 4.25 and 4.5%, a rate it has maintained since the end of 2024. The divided Federal Reserve voted to keep the rate steady despite a barrage of criticism from Trump and dissents from two officials. “Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated,” a press release following the decision states. The decision was met with opposition from governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, with both advocating for the Fed to start easing in acknowledgement that inflation is under control and the labor market could weaken soon. This marks the first time since 1993 that multiple governors cast no votes on a rate decision. Trump dismissed concerns that lowering interest rates could ultimately increase inflation. “Well, if that happens, you just raise them,” he said. Trump is taking questions now, and is resolute that interest rates must drop. “We’re keeping the rates high, and we’re hurting people from buying houses,” he says. Taking another jab, in a long series of them, at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, Trump says “he’s done a bad job.” The president says that Powell is always “too late”, and adds that Powell probably won’t cut the interest rate today for reasons that “nobody knows.” President Trump is now in the Roosevelt Room signing a bill that provides relief to veterans and their families who have fallen behind on mortgage payments. In response to the new congressional map released by Texas Republicans today, Democrats in the state and beyond have wasted no time rebuking it. The Texas House Democrats said in a statement: These maps are a corrupt, racially motivated gerrymander designed to steal the voices of Black and Latino Texans so Donald Trump can send five new hand-picked allies to Washington. Similarly, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) said that it anticipates Texas will land itself a lawsuit, and believes “the map will get struck down”. They added that they plan “to recruit aggressively to unseat every single newly vulnerable Republican who went along with this corrupt scheme”. The treasury department announced sanctions today against Alexandre de Moraes – the high court judge overseeing the investigation into disgraced former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – who is on trial for allegedly attempting to launch a coup after losing the 2022 Brazilian election. Earlier this month secretary of state Marco Rubio said on social media that he ordered a visa revocation for De Moraes. The US accuses De Moraes of “arbitrary pre-trial detentions and suppress freedom of expression”. In a statement treasury secretary Scott Bessent added: De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions—including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today marks the first of three days of hearings investigating the plane collision in DC that killed 67 people in January. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is holding the hearings after an American Airlines passenger jet collided midair with a Black Hawk helicopter earlier this year. The crash killed all aboard both aircrafts. It is also the US’s deadliest air disaster since November 2001. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the three days will be a “fact finding proceeding”, and today’s hearing opened with a video animation of where both aircrafts were leading up to the collision. At the press conference, when asked about whether Democratic senators would be comfortable with redactions, minority leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers “wouldn’t force any agreements that have been broken”, but added that he believes “almost everything can come out”. Schumer also said that he wants the files to be made available to the public and members of Congress, and that Democratic members are working to get some Republican colleagues on board to help make the files public. “It should be bipartisan,” he said. “But if not, there’s recourse in the courts. This is the law.” Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee, shared more about how the letter works, and what it demands. “We are using very unique statutory authority that is granted only to our committee, to homeland security and government affairs. The statute that we are invoking requires the administration to hand over documents … requested by any five members of the Senate committee,” Peters said. “This letter demands that the justice department produce documents that attorney general Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have publicly already confirmed they have in their possession. We all know in fact that the attorney general said, quote, she said they’re sitting on her desk. It should be pretty easy to turn over documents that are sitting on the attorney general’s desk.” At the Capitol, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is outlining his attempt to force attorney general Pam Bondi to release the files related to the investigation of disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. “We’re invoking federal law and using our authority as a check on the executive to compel transparency,” Schumer said. “Today’s letter matters. It’s not a stunt, it’s not symbolic, it’s a formal exercise of congressional power under federal law, and we expect an answer from DoJ by August the 15th. That’s what accountability looks like. This is what oversight looks like, and this is what keeping your promises to the American people look like.” He noted that both Bondi and Donald Trump had previously said they want the case file’s released: This is not complicated. After promising full transparency for years, every single time Trump, his administration, Republican leaders have had a chance to be transparent about the Epstein files, they’ve chosen to hide. The evasions, the delays, the excuses, they are not just odd, they’re alarming. It begs the question, if there’s nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness? Trump should stop hiding from the truth, he should stop hiding from the American people. California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom has indicated he may push to redraw his state’s congressional maps if Texas Republicans approve new maps that could net the GOP five more House seats. Writing on X after Texas Republicans released their proposal for redistricting the state’s House seats, Newsom said: Donald Trump asks for 5 seats and Greg Abbott automatically bends the knee. The 2026 election is being rigged. California won’t sit back and watch this happen. If California Democrats want to redraw their congressional maps in the party’s favor, they will first have to ask voters to cancel a constitutional amendment that created an independent redistricting commission – potentially a tall ask. Top Senate Democrats will hold a press conference in a few minutes about their attempt to use a rarely-invoked law to force attorney general Pam Bondi to hand over the Epstein files. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is due to speak, as well as Gary Peters, the ranking member of the homeland security committee, and other Democrats on the panel. We will let you know what they have to say. Here’s a rundown of the news so far today: We’re preparing for an interest-rate decision from the Federal Reserve at 2pm, and a press conference with chair Jerome Powell 30 minutes after the announcement. It comes as Donald Trump continued to urge Powell to cut the rate on social media. Trump also announced a 25% tariff on India, writing on Truth Social that the US has done “relatively little business” with the country. Trump also said that India would be subject to a further penalty for buying substantial amounts of Russian military equipment and energy. Senate Democrats will at noon hold a press conference after writing a letter to attorney general Pam Bondi to release the full and unredacted Epstein files. They’re invoking a rare and obscure law known as “rule of five”, which states that a government agency must provide information if five or more Senate committee members request it. Beyond Washington, Texas Republicans released a proposed new congressional map for the state. This comes at the urging of Trump, and much earlier than usual. Typically, the state redraws their map every 10 years. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries is talking with Democratic legislators in Texas amid the redistricting battle ensuing in the state. He’s expected to hold a press conference tomorrow as Democrats try to stave off a rewritten map that would cost them a House majority. Texas Republicans have released their new proposed congressional map today. It could add up to five Republican seats if passed. Donald Trump has pressured lawmakers in the state to redraw the map in order to protect the slim majority that Republicans hold in the House as the 2026 midterms loom. Currently, Republicans hold 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats, while Democrats hold 12. Democratic strongholds like California and Maryland have threatened to redraw their maps in response. Democratic Texas congressman Greg Casar, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has responded to a proposed redistricting map published by Punchbowl News. He issued the following statement: Merging the 35th and the 37th districts is illegal voter suppression of Black and Latino Central Texans. By merging our Central Texas districts, Trump wants to commit yet another crime— this time, against Texas voters and against Martin Luther King’s Voting Rights Act of 1965. United, we will fight back with everything we’ve got. While Senate Democrats are on Capitol Hill and pressing for the Epstein files release, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is in Austin, Texas, for closed-door meetings with state Democrats, according to Politico. This comes as Donald Trump pushes Republican legislators in Texas to redraw their congressional district map earlier than usual. Normally, Texas would reconfigure its map every 10 years – aligned with the census. Per Politico, Jeffries will hold a press conference in Texas tomorrow, along with a number of media appearances across cable TV. Later today we’ll find out the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decision, and we can also expect to hear from chair Jerome Powell shortly after. Earlier today, Donald Trump pushed again for the Fed to lower the interest rate on Truth Social: “No Inflation! Let people buy, and refinance, their homes!” Announcing the tariff on Truth Social today, Donald Trump said that “while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them.” Trump added that India will also pay a “penalty” for their role as a substantial buyer of Russian military equipment and energy. “At a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE,” he wrote.

Transcripts of the grand jury proceedings that led to the sex trafficking indictments of the sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, include the testimony of just two law enforcement witnesses, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has said, as it argues for the documents’ release. Top DoJ officials disclosed in a filing late on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court that separate grand juries convened to consider the criminal investigations of Epstein and Maxwell, and had heard from only two witnesses. The revelation was made in the course of court wrangling over whether the transcripts of the proceedings should be unsealed, amid the continuing furor over the Epstein scandal which has roiled Donald Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is urging the two federal judges who presided over the Epstein and Maxwell grand juries, Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer, to release the testimony, in an attempt to calm the uproar. The Trump administration has come under intense pressure from the president’s own base of supporters who were infuriated by the DoJ’s decision not to release any additional Epstein files about the late, disgraced financier’s crimes involving the sex trafficking of girls. The decision jarred with the previous stance of senior administration figures, including Trump himself and the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who had hyped the expected release of more details of the New York financier’s businesses, travels and associations, including a possible list of his financial clients, which all further stoked conspiracies around the well-connected Epstein. Tuesday’s submission states that the grand jury tasked with considering the criminal case against Epstein heard only from an FBI agent when it met in June and July, 2019. A similar grand jury for Maxwell heard from the same FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective when it met in June and July, 2020 and in March, 2021. The memorandum was signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney for the southern district of New York, and included the names of Bondi and deputy attorney general Todd Blanche. Epstein took his own life in a federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges, officials say, but his case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories because of his and Maxwell’s links to famous people, such as royals, presidents and billionaires, including Trump. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring with Epstein in the sexual trafficking of minors. She was convicted in December 2021 on charges that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last week, she sat for two sets of interviews with Justice Department officials, including Blanche, in Florida, where she is serving her time in a federal prison, and answered questions “about 100 different people,” her attorney said. Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and claimed he had cut off their relationship long ago. But he faces ongoing questions about the Epstein case. On Tuesday Trump spoke about connections between Epstein and the president’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. He claimed he evicted the financier from the resort because Epstein “stole” young female staffers from him, including Virginia Giuffre who went on to be a key witness against Epstein and Maxwell. Giuffre died in April. Maxwell has offered to testify before Congress but with conditions, including being granted immunity. Her lawyer has written to the House committee which has subpoenaed her saying that a deposition without immunity would be a “non-starter”. The DoJ memorandum says unsealing the transcripts is “consistent with increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.” On Capitol Hill today, Senate Democrats – led by minority leader Chuck Schumer – will hold a press conference at 12pm ET to discuss their plans to push the justice department to release the full and un-redacted Epstein files. Democrats are using a rare and little-known law, known colloquially as the “rule of five”, which requires government agencies to provide relevant information if at least five members of the committee request it. In this case, all Democrats on the homeland security and governmental affairs committee signed a letter to attorney general Pam Bondi yesterday. Donald Trump is back at the White House today. We’ll see him at 4pm EST for remarks, and he’s expected to sign a bill earlier in the day. It’s currently unclear what that piece of legislation is. Meanwhile on social media, Trump has said that the 1 August reciprocal tariff deadline will not be extended. He wrote: The August first deadline is the August first deadline - it stands strong, and will not be extended. A big day for America!!! Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Russia had developed an “immunity” to sanctions, Reuters reports. The comments came after Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia “10 days from today” if Moscow did not make progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Peskov told reporters: We have been living under a huge number of sanctions for quite a long time, our economy operates under a huge number of restrictions. Therefore, of course, we have already developed a certain immunity in this regard, and we continue to note all statements that come from President Trump, from other international representatives on this matter. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it continued to take into account all statements made by US president Donald Trump, but Russia had acquired immunity to sanctions because it had lived under a huge number of them for a long time, Reuters reports. Trump said on Tuesday that the United States would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia in 10 days if Moscow showed no progress toward ending its more than three-year-long war in Ukraine.

The US’s largest public health insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid, turn 60 years old on Wednesday – a birthday that will be celebrated only weeks after Republicans enacted the largest cuts to healthcare in the nation’s history. Passed in the civil rights era, the sister health insurance programs served as tools for the Democratic president Lyndon Johnson to desegregate American healthcare and fight poverty. “This is an infamous day for the US, which already has the most abysmal healthcare system among our peer nations,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown Law. “Now, in order to give tax relief and spend more on defense, we’re kicking off our most needy citizens from life-saving care.” In a health system defined by a patchwork of public and private coverage, Medicare and Medicaid have stood for 60 years as the civil rights era’s health legacy – their history more often marked by expansion than contraction, even amid decades of attacks from conservatives. That history took a sharp right turn on the Fourth of July, when Donald Trump signed a Republican budget law that will cut $1tn from Medicaid beginning in 2026. “It’s really unconscionable these cuts,” said David Lipschutz, co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, speaking about both programs. “The magnitude, the scope, the targeting of certain lawfully present immigrants, the added requirements and burdens for people with Medicaid – specifically designed to purge the roles of people who would otherwise be eligible.” You can read more of Jessica Geen’s explainer here: Trump’s ‘unconscionable cuts’ to Medicaid and Medicare were decades in the making The Justice Department says in support of its request to unseal grand jury transcripts of proceedings that led to the sex trafficking indictments of New York financier and sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell that they include the testimony of just two law enforcement witnesses, reports the Associated Press (AP). In a filing late on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, officials describe the grand jury witnesses in a memorandum in response to a call from judges presiding over both cases to provide more details about their request earlier this month. Judges would have to approve any request to unseal records. The papers filed on Tuesday cite a 1997 second US Circuit court of appeals ruling that said judges have wide discretion and public interest alone can justify releasing grand jury information. The Epstein grand jury heard only from an FBI agent when it met in June and July of 2019, while the Maxwell grand jury heard from the same FBI agent and a New York police department detective when it met in June and July of 2020 and in March of 2021, according to the submission. The memorandum was signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, and included the names of attorney general Pam Bondi and Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche. After the request to unseal grand jury records, two former prosecutors in Manhattan told the AP the transcripts would be relatively short and contain only the testimony of law enforcement witnesses talking about evidence that tracks information in the indictments. In its filing on Tuesday, the Justice Department further dampened expectations the grand jury transcripts would contain new revelations when it said “certain aspects and subject matters” contained in them became public during Maxwell’s trial. Humana on Wednesday raised its annual profit forecast, as the US health insurer bets on its efforts to rein in higher medical costs that have plagued the sector, Reuters reports. The company is a top provider of Medicare Advantage plans under which the US government pays private insurers a set rate to manage healthcare for people aged 65 and older, and those with disabilities. The industry has been battling with persistently high costs for the last two years due to increased use of healthcare services across the government-backed plans. However, Humana said its medical costs were in line with its expectations. The company now expects full-year profit to be about $17 per share, compared with its previous estimate of about $16.25. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $16.38 per share. Oliver Milman is an environment reporter for Guardian US. US liberals have become so disgusted with Tesla since Elon Musk’s rightward turn that they are now not only far less likely to purchase the car brand but also less willing to buy any type of electric car, new research has found. The popularity of Tesla among liberal-minded Americans has plummeted since Musk, Tesla’s chief executive and the world’s richest person, allied himself with Donald Trump and helped propel the president to election victory last year. While liberals reported mostly positive intentions around buying an electric car in August 2023, their overall support for EVs eroded in the wake of a collapse in their opinion of Teslas, according to the new study, which polled Americans on an array of environmental actions. By the latest poll, taken in March as Musk was gutting the federal workforce in his role as Trump’s top adviser after delivering what appeared to be a Nazi salute, the intention to buy any EV among liberals slipped into negative territory. Alexandra Flores, a psychologist at Williams College and lead author of the study, published in Nature, said: The suspicion is that Elon Musk became so synonymous with EVs in the US that perceptions of him affected the entire class of vehicles. This made them way less appealing to liberals – he really dragged down perceptions of EVs in general. It’s definitely unusual to have a chief executive have an impact on a whole class of products like this. You can read more of Oliver Milman’s report here: Elon Musk is turning US liberals off not just Tesla but electric vehicles in general A cryptocurrency working group formed by president Donald Trump will release a report on Wednesday that is expected to outline the administration’s stances on tokenization and market-defining crypto legislation, among other issues critically important to the digital asset industry, Reuters reports. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump ordered the creation of a crypto working group tasked with proposing new regulations, making good on his campaign promise to overhaul US crypto policy. Wednesday’s report is a culmination of the taskforce’s work so far and its first public findings. In line with Trump’s January executive order, it will lay out what rules and laws should be enacted to advance the policy goals of the pro-crypto White House. Those include making sure that the Securities and Exchange Commission has a framework in place for firms to offer blockchain-based stocks and bonds, according to one person familiar with the discussions. The report is also expected to discuss the administration’s wishlist for legislation Congress is debating to create broad regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrency, according to a second person familiar with the report. The working group led by Trump official Bo Hines is composed of several administration officials including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. The White House, Treasury Department and the SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. Hello and welcome back to our coverage of US politics. Donald Trump’s administration urged two judges on Tuesday night to release testimony heard by the grand juries that indicted the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges as the president seeks to calm an uproar over his administration’s handling of the matter. The Justice Department first sought court permission on 18 July to make public transcripts of the confidential testimony given by witnesses years ago in the two cases, but Manhattan-based US district judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer asked the government to flesh out the legal bases for the requests. The US president also spoke about Jeffrey Epstein and his links to the president’s Mar-a-Lago club, saying that the late sex offender “stole” Virginia Giuffre and other young female staffers when he hired them while they were working at the Florida country club. Trump, who has faced an outcry over his administration’s refusal to release more records about Epstein after promises of transparency, made the comments on Air Force One while returning from a trip to Scotland. In other developments: In Hawaii, waves of up to 1.7 metres (5.5 feet) affected the islands before the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reduced its warning level for the state about 08.50 GMT, saying no major tsunami was expected after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Russia. Coastal residents were earlier told to get to high ground or the fourth floor or above of buildings, and the US Coast Guard ordered ships out of harbours. Tsunami waves of nearly half a metre were observed as far as California, with smaller ones reaching Canada’s province of British Columbia. Indian exporters are bracing for higher US tariffs to kick in as prospects dim for an interim trade deal between New Delhi and Washington before the 1 August deadline. On Tuesday, US president Donald Trump said India could face a 20-25% rate since a deal had not been finalised, although he added that a final levy was yet to be decided. A group of global civil society organizations have placed the US on a watchlist for urgent concern over the health of its civic society, alongside Turkey, Serbia, El Salvador, Indonesia and Kenya. On Wednesday, a new report released by the non-profit Civicus placed the US on its watchlist after “sustained attacks on civic freedoms” across the country, according to the group. President Trump said on Tuesday he might skip the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) leaders’ summit in South Africa in November and send someone else to represent the United States, citing his disapproval of South African policies. “I think maybe I’ll send somebody else because I’ve had a lot of problems with South Africa. They have some very bad policies,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. The United States has repatriated an American child from a large camp in northeastern Syria. The camp houses tens of thousands of people with alleged ties to the Islamic State group. The state department announced the move on Wednesday. The al-Hawl Camp holds about 30,000 people from 70 countries, mostly families and supporters of IS fighters. Vinay Prasad, the US Food and Drug Administration’s chief medical and science officer, has left the health regulator, the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said on Tuesday, confirming an earlier news report. The US Senate on Tuesday confirmed Emil Bove, a top justice department official and former defense attorney for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on a federal appeals court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for ignoring court orders. The vote broke nearly along party lines, with 50 Republican senators voting for his confirmation to a seat on the third circuit court of appeals overseeing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin Islands.
