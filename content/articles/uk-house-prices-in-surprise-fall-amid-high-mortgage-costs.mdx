  UK house prices unexpectedly fell in August as high mortgage costs dampened
  activity. The average price for a home dropped by 0.1% to £271,079 last month
  compared with July, according to the Nationwide. Economists had expected a
  rise of 0.2%, according to a poll by Reuters. The annual rate of house price
  growth slowed to 2.1% in August from 2.4% in July, Britain’s biggest building
  society said. Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide, said higher
  borrowing costs were squeezing buyers’ budgets and pushing down prices. “House
  prices are still high compared with household incomes, making raising a
  deposit challenging for prospective buyers, especially given the intense cost
  of living pressures in recent years,” he added. “Combined with the fact that
  mortgage costs are more than three times the levels prevailing in the wake of
  the pandemic, this means that the cost of servicing a mortgage is also a
  barrier for many.” An average first-time buyer paying with a 20% deposit faced
  a monthly mortgage payment equivalent of about 35% of their take-home pay, he
  said. That compared with a long run average of 30%. Affordability is still
  stretched despite the fact that the Bank of England’s monetary policy
  committee voted to cut the base rate by a quarter-point to 4% in August. The
  cut took borrowing costs to the lowest level since March 2023. However, Mark
  Harris, the chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said
  some lenders had begun to price their mortgage deals upwards. “The mixed
  picture is down to rising swap rates, which underpin the pricing of fixed-rate
  mortgages, and lenders not wanting to offer the best rates during the summer
  months when staff are on holiday and resources are limited,” he added. The
  average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 4.96% at the end of August, according
  to the analyst Moneyfacts. The average rate for a five-year deal was 5%.
  Elliott Jordan-Doak, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the
  possibility of property tax rises in Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget had “the
  potential to throw sand in the gears of housing activity”. The Guardian
  revealed the Treasury was considering a new tax on the sale of homes above
  £500,000, which some market watchers said could slow activity in the short
  term, especially in London and the south-east. While the Bank of England cut
  interest rates last month, it raised concern about inflationary pressures in
  the economy that could slow the rate of further cuts. Inflation rose to 3.8%
  in July, more than expected, amid higher food prices and travel costs, and
  sitting above the central bank’s 2% target for the 10th month in a row. The
  Bank has predicted it will hit 4% in September.
