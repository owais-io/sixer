  Good morning. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is pouring cold water on
  hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough in the Russia-Ukraine war, claiming that
  he is “far from” meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu
  has confirmed Israel intends to take military control of all of Gaza,
  temporarily. Three years ago house prices in Sydney and Toronto in Canada
  looked the same, but since then they have widely diverged. We ask: could a
  similar property slump happen here? Plus: we look at why some Australian
  netballers are choosing to turn their backs on the sport. Australia ‘Shocking’
  | Forest across an area more than 1,000 times the size of the Sydney CBD was
  bulldozed in Queensland in 2022-23, new figures have revealed – sparking
  warnings of risks to endangered species. Analysis | At the start of 2022,
  Sydney and Toronto had equivalent home prices. But while Australia’s urban
  property values have kept rising, Canada’s have crashed. Could Australia see a
  similar slump? ‘Cannot be trusted’ | As the government plans to include
  YouTube in its ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16,
  Guardian readers shared insights into how their kids use the platform. Gender
  pay gap | A landmark report has found that workplace gender segregation is “a
  handbrake” on Australia’s economy, as figures reveal men are paid more than
  women in 98% of jobs. AI debate | The government is facing rising pressure to
  confirm how it plans to regulate fast-growing AI technology, with the
  Coalition critical of what it sees as mixed messaging from Labor ministers.
  World Russia-Ukraine war | Vladimir Putin has said he is not ready to meet
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a refusal that could derail prospects of a face-to-face
  bilateral summit with Donald Trump next week; Kyiv has opened a war crime
  inquiry into the head of a notorious Russian prison. Trump tariffs | More than
  60 countries are scrambling to respond to the latest wave of US tariffs
  announced by Donald Trump, amid dire warnings of job losses and trade impacts;
  Narendra Modi says India is ready to “pay a heavy price” as it seeks to resist
  US tariffs. Gaza crisis | Benjamin Netanyahu says he intends to push ahead
  with a full military occupation of Gaza – but says Israel doesn’t want to
  “keep it”; the footballer known as “Palestinian Pelé” has been killed by an
  Israeli attack in Gaza. ‘Significant step’ | OpenAI says it has taken a leap
  forward with its latest upgrades to ChatGPT – though there are still “many
  things” missing in its quest to create a system able to do humans’ jobs.
  Tackling plastics? | More than 200 industry lobbyists are attending the UN’s
  meeting to hammer out a global plastics treaty, raising fears that moves to
  curb plastic production may be undermined. Full Story Newsroom edition: the
  politics of the Sydney Harbour Bridge protest A sea of people marched across
  the Sydney Harbour Bridge on the weekend to protest against Israel’s actions
  in Gaza. But police, organisers and the protesters themselves all portrayed
  the same public event in a very different light. Bridie Jabour speaks with
  Lenore Taylor and Mike Ticher about the political fallout from the Harbour
  Bridge protest. In-depth Pari Nikau just wants to get a good night’s sleep –
  but each morning he’s woken by NSW police telling him to move on. He is among
  the rough sleepers at Sydney’s Central Station who have faced increasingly
  restrictive rule changes. Officials say they’re “surging” support services in
  the area – but, as Caitlin Cassidy discovers, Nikau and his friends want them
  to start with compassion. Not the news Ashley Zukerman is that guy: you’ll
  know him from something and you’ll have enjoyed him in it. It might be from
  Succession, Apple Cider Vinegar, or Apple’s dystopian drama Silo. Next,
  Melbourne International film festival-goers will see him in One More Shot,
  alongside Emily Browning and a magic bottle of tequila. He talks to Sian Cain
  about disliking heroes, playing “punchable men” – and finally being proud of
  his work. Sport Netball | Australia’s netballers are turning their backs on
  the sport in search of viable careers elsewhere, Georgia Rajic writes.
  Football | Manchester United agreed on a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB
  Leipzig; Barcelona have stripped the captaincy from Marc-André ter Stegen as a
  medical dispute drags on. Cricket | Investors believe that the Hundred will
  become a multibillion-dollar competition to rival the Indian Premier League.
  Rugby union | Leroy Carter’s inclusion in the All Blacks squad to play in
  Argentina was still sinking in when he found his dog had chewed up his
  passport. Media roundup Australia’s weather forecasts are under threat from
  deep cuts being made to key United States scientific agencies, ABC News
  reports. Three months after the election, the battle for the Bradfield
  constituency continues as it moves to the high court, the Sydney Morning
  Herald reports. A $600m Adelaide airport upgrade has been cleared for takeoff,
  including expansion of the terminal and check-in hall, the Advertiser reports.
  Ningaloo Reef, off Western Australia’s north-west coast, has suffered
  wide-scale coral bleaching across more than 100km, the Age reports. What’s
  happening today NT | The trial of crocodile wrangler Matt Wright, accused of
  attempting to pervert the course of justice, continues. ABS | The Australian
  Bureau of Statistics is due to release its latest business turnover figures.
  NT | The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art awards ceremony is
  being held in Darwin. Victoria | The Australian National Alpaca Show is being
  held today in Bendigo. Sign up If you would like to receive this Morning Mail
