  Proving exactly how multi-talented she is, Olympic mountain biking champion
  Pauline Ferrand-Prévot shook up the GC rankings on the steep slopes of the Col
  de la Madeleine, storming away to victory on this year’s Tour de France
  Femme’s queen stage. Today’s mountain stage promised fireworks and it
  delivered. Tomorrow – the final stage of this year’s Tour – offers up more
  tough climbs, fierce battles and beautiful scenery. Join me on Sunday for the
  final live blog of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift. Thank you again for
  reading today’s coverage and for emailing in. A race report is on its way and
  will be posted here soon. Speaking after winning the queen stage of the Tour
  de France Femmes avec Zwift 2025 and taking the yellow jersey, Pauline
  Ferrand-Prévot, said she had come back to road cycling from mountain biking so
  she could participate in the Tour. Earlier this year she won Paris-Roubaix
  Femmes. She told reporters: It was super painful, the last kilometre, because
  I wanted to have a gap as big as possible for tomorrow. I also wanted to enjoy
  it but it’s not over until you cross the finish line. I wanted to go as fast
  as I could. I’m so happy we made it. She finished by thanking her Visma-Lease
  a Bike team. Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez), 44pts Maëva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ),
  28pts Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco), 17pts Pauline Ferrand-Prévot
  (Visma-Lease a Bike), 15pts Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ), 14pts Lorena Wiebes
  (SD Worx-Protime), 210pts Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), 178pts Kim Le
  Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal), 133pts Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), 121pts
  Franziska Koch (Picnic-PostNL), 95pts Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a
  Bike), 26hrs 16mins 11secs Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal), +2mins 37secs
  Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), +3mins 18secs Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney
  (Canyon/SRAM), +3mins 40secs Cédrine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), +4mins

  52secs Évita Muzic (FDJ-Suez), +5mins 58secs Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez),
  +7mins 14secs A lot of change in the GC rankings after stage eight. Pauline
  Ferrand-Prévot takes the top spot, with Kim Le Court Pienaar dropping to 11th
  place. Sarah Gigante jumped from eight to second place, while Demi Vollering
  and Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney swap positions. Cédrine Kerbaol ends up two
  spots higher, Dominika Włodarczyk moves up from 11th to seventh and Niamh
  Fisher-Black is up to eight from 13th place. Anna van der Breggen drops out
  the top 10 and sits in 12th position now. 1. Pauline Ferrand-Prévot
  (Visma-Lease a Bike) 2. Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal), +1min 45secs 3.
  Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek), +2min 15secs 4. Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez),
  +3min 3secs 5. Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) +3min 3secs Pauline
  Ferrand-Prévot wins stage eight and takes the yellow jersey from Kim Le
  Court-Pienaar. The Visma-Lease a Bike absolutely smashed the queen stage. What
  a time for French cycling fans! 1km to go: Ferrand-Prévot passes under the
  flamme rouge and takes a moment to look down the mountain. I think Emmanuel
  Macron might be tweeting again soon. 2km to go: Looking cool and unruffled,
  Ferrand-Prévot continues to devastate the GC rankings as she rides towards
  victory on stage eight. Gigante is 1min 20secs behind her. 3km to go:
  Vollering has put in a huge effort up this climb. She’s now caught up with
  Niewiadoma-Phinney. Gigante is 1min 13secs behind Ferrand-Prévot. 4km to go:
  The Visma-Lease a Bike rider has gone solo towards the finish. She’s
  surrounded by huge cheering crowds along this climb. If this carries on as
  smoothly as it’s going, then Ferrand-Prévot has really played a blinder. 5km
  to go: It’s just Ferrand-Prévot and Fisher-Black as Kastelijn drops off.
  Ferrand-Prévot’s parents are on the side of the road with homemade placards
  for her. So sweet. 6km to go: Ferrand-Prévot catches Fisher-Black and
  Kastelijn and has 38secs on Gigante. Ferrand-Prévot looks so controlled and
  calm. According to the commentators on TNT Sport, the French rider has only
  won one stage race before and it was in 2014. 8km to go: Ferrand-Prévot has
  dropped Gigante. The French rider, who is also an Olympic mountain bike
  champion, is about 30secs behind Fisher-Black and Kastelijn. She has her eyes
  set on the stage win and the maillot jaune! 9km to go: It’s a 12% gradient for
  Fisher-Black and Kastelijn on the part of the climb they’re on. Gigante needs
  to shake off Ferrand-Prévot if she’s hoping to win the stage and take the
  yellow jersey. 10km to go: Ferrand-Prévot manages to get over to Gigante and
  Rooijakkers. But then the Dutch rider ends up distanced and ends up behind in
  the Niewiadoma-Phinney group. Vollering is about 35 secs behind Ferrand-Prevot
  and Gigante. 11km to go: The yellow jersey group catch up with Squiban and she
  slots in with the group. Le Court Pienaar has done her job setting up her
  teammate, so Gigante attacks. Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck) is the
  only rider that can go with her. 13km to go: By the time the riders reach the
  top of the Col de la Madeleine, they will be at an altitude of almost 2,000m.
  Fisher-Black attacks from what was left of the breakaway and Kastelijn
  follows. They are about 2mins ahead of the yellow jersey group. 14km to go:
  Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx Protime) has been dropped on the climb. Pauline
  Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Le Court Pienaar and Demi Vollering
  (FDJ-Suez) are being lead up the ascent by Chabbey. 15km to go: Sprinter Vos
  is dropping off the back of the peloton. Squiban is joined by Koch behind the
  breakaway as they slog away up the Col de la Madeleine (hors catégorie, 18.6
  km at 8.1%). It’s the third-highest summit finish in the history of the Tour
  de France Femmes, according to the race centre. 16km to go: Well, I was just
  about to try to answer Simon’s question about Squiban, see below: Hi Amy.
  Thanks for your coverage! What do you think the chances are that Squiban can
  win again? But I’ve just seen on the TV coverage that the young UAE Team ADQ
  rider seems to have hung her head in defeat. I think she’s done, sadly. But it
  was a tough ask, this climb looks long, brutal and unrelenting. 18km to go:
  Dygert has done her job driving the peloton and peels off. Chabbey drops off
  the breakaway. Now, 11 riders make up the break and have 1min 45secs on the
  yellow jersey group. The 11 riders are: Muzic, Fisher-Black, Squiban,
  Ghekiere, Vallieres, Markus, Kastelijn, Edwards, Meijering, Koch and Bunel.
  25km to go: White jersey wearer, Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL) has a flat tyre
  and is forced to stop. She sets off on her teammate Megan Jastrab’s bike.
  Below are the results from the last QOM climb: Côte de
  Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières QOM climb result: 1. Chabbey, 5pts 2. Squiban, 3pts
  3. Koch, 2pts 4. Kastelijn, 1pt Chabbey is guaranteed to maintain the polka
  dot jersey as long as she finishes today stage. There are 16pts between her
  and second-placed Squiban, but only 15pts on offer at the top of the Col de la
  Madeleine. 31km to go: Danni Rowe has been running through the route profile
  of the Col de la Madeleine and it sounds very tough. She says there are some
  particularly steep sections, especially near the start. This climb has been
  used 27 times in the Tour de France apparently. 37km to go: Squiban doesn’t
  fight Chabbey for the maximum QOM points but still scoops up a few. Here are
  the full results from the intermediate sprint earlier: Intermediate sprint
  result, Châteaufort: 1. Koch, 25pts 2. Squiban, 20pts 3. Chabbey, 17pts 4.
  Markus, 15pts 5. Edwards, 13pts 6. Vallieres, 11pts 7. Meijering, 10pts 8.
  Ghekiere, 9pts 9. Kastelijn, 8pts 10. Muzic, 7pts 11. Claes, 6 ts 12.
  Fisher-Black, 5pts 13. Bunel, 4pts 14. Santesteban, 3pts 15. Wiebes, 2pts 38km
  to go: The breakaway are almost at the summit from the top of the Côte de
  Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières, where there will be more QOM points on offer. Will
  Chabbey push and will Squiban fight? If you have any thoughts, predictions or
  questions on today’s stage or the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift in general,
  you can get in touch via email (linked above). 41km to go: Now it’s time for
  the category two 4.9 km Côte de Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières, with an average
  gradient of 5.9%. The breakaway, being lead by Chabbey, still have about 4mins
  on the peloton. FDJ-Suez’s Muzic is the virtual yellow jersey at the moment –
  that means if the race finished right now or she ended this stage with the
  same gap on Le Court-Pienaar then she would be the maillot jaune. Marc from
  Mauritius has been in touch again today. He emails to say that a vibrant
  poster of Kim Le Court-Pienaar has been circulating on the national flag. He
  says: [It] was the best statement of the national passion she has created here
  on our small island. And the enthusiasm for cycling. We hear the Alps will be
  tough for her today but she made us dream in the last days. I’m sure he’ll be
  happy to hear that she’s made it back safely to the peloton after her crash
  earlier. Here’s hoping she’s OK and not feeling too sore. 48km to go: Finally
  some flattish roads for the riders. Brief respite before they start climbing
  up the second category Côte de Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières (4.9km at 5.9%). Le
  Court-Pienaar is back with the peloton. 54km to go: In the breakaway, Koch is
  first into the intermediate sprint, followed by Squiban. Behind Vos and Wiebes
  battle up the climb of the sprint – it’s 1.4km at 7%. Not a fun sprint! 55km
  to go: Mariann Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) makes a move, alongside her teammates,
  to make the pace harder for Wiebes and AG Insurance-Soudal. Wiebes matches the
  pace and sits in about third place. 58km to go: Wiebes is absolutely pushing
  it as she zooms down this descent. Le Court-Pienaar is doing her best to get
  back to the peloton. She’s about 50secs behind. The breakaway group now
  consists of 13 riders, including Muzic, Fisher-Black, Squiban and Chabbey.
  62km to go: It’s intense on this descent. From what Matt Stephens says on the
  back of the moto for TNT Sports, there are a lot of riders on the descent, the
  pace is fast and there is a slight air of chaos. He also said that the
  Canyon/Sram Zondacrypto team car crew told him they are concerned about the
  breakaway and want to control it but without using up too many resources. The
  maillot jaune, Kim Le Court-Pienaar, has crashed on the descent. She goes off
  the side of the road, manages to slow down but looks as if she went over the
  handlebars. But she’s up and back on her bike. 68km to go: Chabbey ups the
  pace and Muzic follows. They, along with other riders, manage to catch Squiban
  and Koch but Claes drops behind. So, in total there are now 14 riders in the
  breakaway and they have almost 4mins on the peloton. 71km to go: Maëva Squiban
  (UAE Team ADQ), Lotte Claes (Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels) and Franziska Koch
  (Picnic-PostNL) have managed to get away from the breakaway and created a
  12sec gap. Chloe Dygert picks up the pace (Canyon/SRAM zondocrypto) on the
  front of the peloton. 78km to go: The peloton appear to have let the break go
  for now– the gap has grown to 2mins 40secs. Morgane Coston (Roland Le Dévoluy)
  and Célia Le Mouel (Ceratizit) are in pursuit but are 2mins behind the break.
  84km to go: Kopecky is leading teammate Wiebes who’s aim will be to catch the
  breakaway so she can get maximum points at the intermediate sprint coming up
  in about 30km. If she manages that, it’ll strengthen her lead in the points
  classification and bring her a step closer to wearing the green jersey on
  tomorrow’s final podium. 90km to go: Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) leads the
  peloton on the descent. Here is a list of the 14 riders in the break: Muzic,
  Fisher-Black, Squiban, Ghekiere, Chabbey, Vallieres, Santesteban, Markus,
  Kastelijn, Claes, Edwards, Meijering, Koch and Bunel. 92km to go: The
  breakaway group have 35secs on the peloton. Here are the results from the
  first climb: Col de Plainpalais QOM climb result: 1. Chabbey, 10pts 2.
  Squiban, 8pts 3. Markus, 6pts 4. Meijering, 4pts 5. Muzic, 2pts 6. Kastelijn,
  1pt 98km to go: Chabbey sprints to reach the summit first and take maximum QOM
  points. Behind, AG Insurance-Soudal lead the peloton. Impressively, sprinter
  Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) is firmly in this first group of the peloton,
  unlike her rival for the green jersey, Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike). 99km
  to go: And of course, Squiban effortlessly gets across. The 15-rider break
  only have 18secs on the peloton now. Talking about her strength and energy, it
  reminds me of this video where her dad asks her if she’s slept. A classic
  parent question, even when your child has just won two Tour de France Femmes
  stages! 100km to go: Maëva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) is off! She’s attempting to
  bridge across to the breakaway. It would seem the French rider just does not
  tire. 101km to go: A group of 14 riders, including Chabbey and Niamh
  Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) have managed to get up the road away from the
  peloton. They have almost 30secs on the bunch. 103km to go: Our maillot jaune,
  Kim Le Court-Pienaar, wants to get away. She breaks away from the peloton for
  the second time, closing in on a counterattack by Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease a
  Bike) and Chabbey. Ostolaza has been distanced by Markus at the front of the
  race. It’s been a lively start. 105km to go: Riejanne Markus (Lidl-Trek)
  attacks with Usoa Ostolaza (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaction Euskadi), with about 8km
  to the summit of the Col du Plainpalais. The peloton is losing ground. There
  are a couple of groups of distanced riders, with Andersen 4mins back alongside
  Laboral Kutxa-Fundaction Euskadi’s Alba Teruel. 106km to go: The start,
  heading upwards towards a category first climb, has caused early fractures in
  the peloton. Two groups who fell behind have now merged into one consisting of
  16 riders. The GC contenders are all in the peloton and it seems to be mainly
  Uno X Mobility’s Susanne Andersen who is struggling with the pace. French
  rider Dilyxine Miermont for Ceratizit did not start stage eight so has
  withdrawn from the race. There are now 129 riders in the Tour peloton. 108km
  to go: Elise Chabbey (Lidl-Trek) is on the attack. The number of riders
  already dropped on this immediate uphill grows to seven and includes Uno X
  Mobility’s Susanne Andersen, Fenix-Deceuninck’s Flora Perkins and Winspace
  Orange Seal’s Fiona Mangan. 109km to go: The peloton are riding on the slopes
  leading to the category one Col de Plainpalais (13.2 km at 6.3%). Already,
  four riders have been dropped and are 42secs behind. 110km to go: The flag has
  dropped and racing is under way on this Tour’s queen stage! Let’s see what the
  riders have in store for us. Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney has a mechanical. The
  defending champion stops to change her front wheel 1km from the end of the
  neutralised sector. Stage eight of the Tour de France Femmes 2025 is under
  way. The peloton have rolled out from Chambéry. There’s a 4.8km neutralised
  section before the racing begins. For the second day in the row, Maëva Squiban
  (UAE Team ADQ) is on the front page of L’Équipe: She also delightedly shared a
  congratulatory message from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on social
  media. In it, he said: Deux victoires consécutives sur le Tour de France pour
  Maëva Squiban ! Bravo pour cette performance exceptionnelle qui fait rayonner
  le cyclisme français. Le pays est derrière vous ! According to a quick Google
  Translate, this means: Two consecutive Tour de France victories for Maëva
  Squiban! Congratulations on this exceptional performance that shines a
  spotlight on French cycling. The country is behind you! And who’s wearing
  which jersey: Yellow jersey: Kim Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal), 22hrs
  28mins 31secs Green jersey: Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime), 208pts Polka dot
  jersey: Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez), 29pts White jersey: Nienke Vinke
  (Picnic-PostNL), 22hrs 37mins 46secs Here’s a reminder of the top ten on GC
  after stage seven: Kim Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal), 22hrs 28mins
  31secs Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike), +26secs Katarzyna
  Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/SRAM), +30secs Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), +31secs
  Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx Protime), +35secs Pauliena Rooijakkers
  (Fenix-Deceuninck), +1min 4secs Cédrine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), +1min
  9secs Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal), +1min 14secs Évita Muzic
  (FDJ-Suez), +1min 35secs Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), +1min 35secs Here is the
  route profile of stage eight of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift: Here’s a
  look at today’s stage, Saturday 2 August: Chambéry to Saint François Longchamp
  – Col de la Madeleine, 111.9km, with the race director of the Tour de France
  Femmes, Marion Rousse: There’ll be no respite on what’s the queen stage of the
  2025 edition. It will head into the Bauges massif straight away, with the
  first major difficulty coming on the way out of Chambéry in the form of the
  Col de Plainpalais (13.2km at 6.3%). After crossing the less demanding Col du
  Frêne, the race will reach the Maurienne and tackle the toughest flank of the
  Madeleine. Extending to 18.6km, with regular changes in gradient (averaging
  8.1%) and a rough surface, this climb will provide plenty of opportunities to
  create gaps. Stage eight of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift is the
  queen’s stage – regarded as the most challenging mountain stage of a multi-day
  race. It often featurs the highest climbs and most significant elevation gain.
  Today, the peloton will ride 111.9km from Chambéry to Saint François Longchamp
  – Col de la Madeleine, taking in more than 3,500 meters of climbing, making it
  a brutal day out. The first ascent of the day will come at 13km, with the
  category one Col de Plainpalais (13.2km at 6.3%). The sharp Côte de
  Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières comes duing the second half of racing, and then it’s
  all go towards the finish at the summit of the imposing Col de la Madeleine
  (18.6 km at 8.1%, rising to over 2,000m above sea level). It’s the penultimate
  day of the Tour, so any GC contenders who want to make their mark will surely
  have plans for this decisive stage. While Kim Le Court Pienaar (AG
  Insurance-Soudal) hung on to the yellow jersey yesterday after being dropped
  on the final climb, she’ll face stiff competition from Pauline Ferrand-Prévot
  (Visma-Lease a Bike), Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/SRAM), Demi
  Vollering (FDJ-Suez) and Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx Protime) who are all
  biting at her heels (none are further than 35secs behind the maillot jaune).
  Le Court Pienaar’s teammate and powerful climber Sarah Gigante might fancy the
  stage win and the Mauritian rider spoke effusively yesterday about her
  colleague’s strength coming into this mountain stage. Maëva Squiban (UAE Team
  ADQ) made it two victories in a row yesterday, so I’m excited to see what
  she’s got in store today. Shirin van Anrooij and Niamh Fisher-Black
  (Lidl-Trek) Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez), Silke Smulders and Mavi García (Liv
  Alula Jayco) are worth keeping an eye on in terms of a potential breakaway.
  Today’s action will kick off at 1.45pm CET/12.45pm BST. Here is Jeremy
  Whittle’s stage seven race report from Chambéry:

Fisher-Black attacks from what was left of the breakaway and Kastelijn follows. They are about 2mins ahead of the yellow jersey group. 14km to go: Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx Protime) has been dropped on the climb. Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Le Court Pienaar and Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) are being lead up the ascent by Chabbey. 15km to go: Sprinter Vos is dropping off the back of the peloton. Squiban is joined by Koch behind the breakaway as they slog away up the Col de la Madeleine (hors catégorie, 18.6 km at 8.1%). It’s the third-highest summit finish in the history of the Tour de France Femmes, according to the race centre. 16km to go: Well, I was just about to try to answer Simon’s question about Squiban, see below: Hi Amy. Thanks for your coverage! What do you think the chances are that Squiban can win again? But I’ve just seen on the TV coverage that the young UAE Team ADQ rider seems to have hung her head in defeat. I think she’s done, sadly. But it was a tough ask, this climb looks long, brutal and unrelenting. 18km to go: Dygert has done her job driving the peloton and peels off. Chabbey drops off the breakaway. Now, 11 riders make up the break and have 1min 45secs on the yellow jersey group. The 11 riders are: Muzic, Fisher-Black, Squiban, Ghekiere, Vallieres, Markus, Kastelijn, Edwards, Meijering, Koch and Bunel. 25km to go: White jersey wearer, Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL) has a flat tyre and is forced to stop. She sets off on her teammate Megan Jastrab’s bike. Below are the results from the last QOM climb: Côte de Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières QOM climb result: 1. Chabbey, 5pts 2. Squiban, 3pts 3. Koch, 2pts 4. Kastelijn, 1pt Chabbey is guaranteed to maintain the polka dot jersey as long as she finishes today stage. There are 16pts between her and second-placed Squiban, but only 15pts on offer at the top of the Col de la Madeleine. 31km to go: Danni Rowe has been running through the route profile of the Col de la Madeleine and it sounds very tough. She says there are some particularly steep sections, especially near the start. This climb has been used 27 times in the Tour de France apparently. 37km to go: Squiban doesn’t fight Chabbey for the maximum QOM points but still scoops up a few. Here are the full results from the intermediate sprint earlier: Intermediate sprint result, Châteaufort: 1. Koch, 25pts 2. Squiban, 20pts 3. Chabbey, 17pts 4. Markus, 15pts 5. Edwards, 13pts 6. Vallieres, 11pts 7. Meijering, 10pts 8. Ghekiere, 9pts 9. Kastelijn, 8pts 10. Muzic, 7pts 11. Claes, 6 ts 12. Fisher-Black, 5pts 13. Bunel, 4pts 14. Santesteban, 3pts 15. Wiebes, 2pts 38km to go: The breakaway are almost at the summit from the top of the Côte de Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières, where there will be more QOM points on offer. Will Chabbey push and will Squiban fight? If you have any thoughts, predictions or questions on today’s stage or the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift in general, you can get in touch via email (linked above). 41km to go: Now it’s time for the category two 4.9 km Côte de Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières, with an average gradient of 5.9%. The breakaway, being lead by Chabbey, still have about 4mins on the peloton. FDJ-Suez’s Muzic is the virtual yellow jersey at the moment – that means if the race finished right now or she ended this stage with the same gap on Le Court-Pienaar then she would be the maillot jaune. Marc from Mauritius has been in touch again today. He emails to say that a vibrant poster of Kim Le Court-Pienaar has been circulating on the national flag. He says: [It] was the best statement of the national passion she has created here on our small island. And the enthusiasm for cycling. We hear the Alps will be tough for her today but she made us dream in the last days. I’m sure he’ll be happy to hear that she’s made it back safely to the peloton after her crash earlier. Here’s hoping she’s OK and not feeling too sore. 48km to go: Finally some flattish roads for the riders. Brief respite before they start climbing up the second category Côte de Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières (4.9km at 5.9%). Le Court-Pienaar is back with the peloton. 54km to go: In the breakaway, Koch is first into the intermediate sprint, followed by Squiban. Behind Vos and Wiebes battle up the climb of the sprint – it’s 1.4km at 7%. Not a fun sprint! 55km to go: Mariann Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) makes a move, alongside her teammates, to make the pace harder for Wiebes and AG Insurance-Soudal. Wiebes matches the pace and sits in about third place. 58km to go: Wiebes is absolutely pushing it as she zooms down this descent. Le Court-Pienaar is doing her best to get back to the peloton. She’s about 50secs behind. The breakaway group now consists of 13 riders, including Muzic, Fisher-Black, Squiban and Chabbey. 62km to go: It’s intense on this descent. From what Matt Stephens says on the back of the moto for TNT Sports, there are a lot of riders on the descent, the pace is fast and there is a slight air of chaos. He also said that the Canyon/Sram Zondacrypto team car crew told him they are concerned about the breakaway and want to control it but without using up too many resources. The maillot jaune, Kim Le Court-Pienaar, has crashed on the descent. She goes off the side of the road, manages to slow down but looks as if she went over the handlebars. But she’s up and back on her bike. 68km to go: Chabbey ups the pace and Muzic follows. They, along with other riders, manage to catch Squiban and Koch but Claes drops behind. So, in total there are now 14 riders in the breakaway and they have almost 4mins on the peloton. 71km to go: Maëva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ), Lotte Claes (Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels) and Franziska Koch (Picnic-PostNL) have managed to get away from the breakaway and created a 12sec gap. Chloe Dygert picks up the pace (Canyon/SRAM zondocrypto) on the front of the peloton. 78km to go: The peloton appear to have let the break go for now– the gap has grown to 2mins 40secs. Morgane Coston (Roland Le Dévoluy) and Célia Le Mouel (Ceratizit) are in pursuit but are 2mins behind the break. 84km to go: Kopecky is leading teammate Wiebes who’s aim will be to catch the breakaway so she can get maximum points at the intermediate sprint coming up in about 30km. If she manages that, it’ll strengthen her lead in the points classification and bring her a step closer to wearing the green jersey on tomorrow’s final podium. 90km to go: Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) leads the peloton on the descent. Here is a list of the 14 riders in the break: Muzic, Fisher-Black, Squiban, Ghekiere, Chabbey, Vallieres, Santesteban, Markus, Kastelijn, Claes, Edwards, Meijering, Koch and Bunel. 92km to go: The breakaway group have 35secs on the peloton. Here are the results from the first climb: Col de Plainpalais QOM climb result: 1. Chabbey, 10pts 2. Squiban, 8pts 3. Markus, 6pts 4. Meijering, 4pts 5. Muzic, 2pts 6. Kastelijn, 1pt 98km to go: Chabbey sprints to reach the summit first and take maximum QOM points. Behind, AG Insurance-Soudal lead the peloton. Impressively, sprinter Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) is firmly in this first group of the peloton, unlike her rival for the green jersey, Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike). 99km to go: And of course, Squiban effortlessly gets across. The 15-rider break only have 18secs on the peloton now. Talking about her strength and energy, it reminds me of this video where her dad asks her if she’s slept. A classic parent question, even when your child has just won two Tour de France Femmes stages! 100km to go: Maëva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) is off! She’s attempting to bridge across to the breakaway. It would seem the French rider just does not tire. 101km to go: A group of 14 riders, including Chabbey and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) have managed to get up the road away from the peloton. They have almost 30secs on the bunch. 103km to go: Our maillot jaune, Kim Le Court-Pienaar, wants to get away. She breaks away from the peloton for the second time, closing in on a counterattack by Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Chabbey. Ostolaza has been distanced by Markus at the front of the race. It’s been a lively start. 105km to go: Riejanne Markus (Lidl-Trek) attacks with Usoa Ostolaza (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaction Euskadi), with about 8km to the summit of the Col du Plainpalais. The peloton is losing ground. There are a couple of groups of distanced riders, with Andersen 4mins back alongside Laboral Kutxa-Fundaction Euskadi’s Alba Teruel. 106km to go: The start, heading upwards towards a category first climb, has caused early fractures in the peloton. Two groups who fell behind have now merged into one consisting of 16 riders. The GC contenders are all in the peloton and it seems to be mainly Uno X Mobility’s Susanne Andersen who is struggling with the pace. French rider Dilyxine Miermont for Ceratizit did not start stage eight so has withdrawn from the race. There are now 129 riders in the Tour peloton. 108km to go: Elise Chabbey (Lidl-Trek) is on the attack. The number of riders already dropped on this immediate uphill grows to seven and includes Uno X Mobility’s Susanne Andersen, Fenix-Deceuninck’s Flora Perkins and Winspace Orange Seal’s Fiona Mangan. 109km to go: The peloton are riding on the slopes leading to the category one Col de Plainpalais (13.2 km at 6.3%). Already, four riders have been dropped and are 42secs behind. 110km to go: The flag has dropped and racing is under way on this Tour’s queen stage! Let’s see what the riders have in store for us. Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney has a mechanical. The defending champion stops to change her front wheel 1km from the end of the neutralised sector. Stage eight of the Tour de France Femmes 2025 is under way. The peloton have rolled out from Chambéry. There’s a 4.8km neutralised section before the racing begins. For the second day in the row, Maëva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) is on the front page of L’Équipe: She also delightedly shared a congratulatory message from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on social media. In it, he said: Deux victoires consécutives sur le Tour de France pour Maëva Squiban ! Bravo pour cette performance exceptionnelle qui fait rayonner le cyclisme français. Le pays est derrière vous ! According to a quick Google Translate, this means: Two consecutive Tour de France victories for Maëva Squiban! Congratulations on this exceptional performance that shines a spotlight on French cycling. The country is behind you! And who’s wearing which jersey: Yellow jersey: Kim Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal), 22hrs 28mins 31secs Green jersey: Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime), 208pts Polka dot jersey: Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez), 29pts White jersey: Nienke Vinke (Picnic-PostNL), 22hrs 37mins 46secs Here’s a reminder of the top ten on GC after stage seven: Kim Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal), 22hrs 28mins 31secs Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike), +26secs Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/SRAM), +30secs Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), +31secs Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx Protime), +35secs Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck), +1min 4secs Cédrine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), +1min 9secs Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal), +1min 14secs Évita Muzic (FDJ-Suez), +1min 35secs Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), +1min 35secs Here is the route profile of stage eight of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift: Here’s a look at today’s stage, Saturday 2 August: Chambéry to Saint François Longchamp – Col de la Madeleine, 111.9km, with the race director of the Tour de France Femmes, Marion Rousse: There’ll be no respite on what’s the queen stage of the 2025 edition. It will head into the Bauges massif straight away, with the first major difficulty coming on the way out of Chambéry in the form of the Col de Plainpalais (13.2km at 6.3%). After crossing the less demanding Col du Frêne, the race will reach the Maurienne and tackle the toughest flank of the Madeleine. Extending to 18.6km, with regular changes in gradient (averaging 8.1%) and a rough surface, this climb will provide plenty of opportunities to create gaps. Stage eight of the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift is the queen’s stage – regarded as the most challenging mountain stage of a multi-day race. It often featurs the highest climbs and most significant elevation gain. Today, the peloton will ride 111.9km from Chambéry to Saint François Longchamp – Col de la Madeleine, taking in more than 3,500 meters of climbing, making it a brutal day out. The first ascent of the day will come at 13km, with the category one Col de Plainpalais (13.2km at 6.3%). The sharp Côte de Saint-Georges-d’Hurtières comes duing the second half of racing, and then it’s all go towards the finish at the summit of the imposing Col de la Madeleine (18.6 km at 8.1%, rising to over 2,000m above sea level). It’s the penultimate day of the Tour, so any GC contenders who want to make their mark will surely have plans for this decisive stage. While Kim Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal) hung on to the yellow jersey yesterday after being dropped on the final climb, she’ll face stiff competition from Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/SRAM), Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) and Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx Protime) who are all biting at her heels (none are further than 35secs behind the maillot jaune). Le Court Pienaar’s teammate and powerful climber Sarah Gigante might fancy the stage win and the Mauritian rider spoke effusively yesterday about her colleague’s strength coming into this mountain stage. Maëva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) made it two victories in a row yesterday, so I’m excited to see what she’s got in store today. Shirin van Anrooij and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez), Silke Smulders and Mavi García (Liv Alula Jayco) are worth keeping an eye on in terms of a potential breakaway. Today’s action will kick off at 1.45pm CET/12.45pm BST. Here is Jeremy Whittle’s stage seven race report from Chambéry:
