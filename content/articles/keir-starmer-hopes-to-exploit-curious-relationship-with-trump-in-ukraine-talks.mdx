  Asked behind the scenes at June’s G7 summit if he could explain why Donald
  Trump seemed to like him so much, Keir Starmer admitted he did not really
  know. Whatever the reason, when it comes to Ukraine, the UK prime minister is
  once again hoping to exploit this somewhat curious relationship. As soon as it
  was announced that a string of European leaders planned to join Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy to back the Ukrainian president in crucial talks with Trump at the
  White House on Monday, it was obvious Starmer would be joining them. The idea
  of Britain being some sort of bridge between US and European interests is
  something of a longstanding UK diplomatic cliche, and not one that always
  necessarily carries much meaning. But in the case of Ukraine, Starmer has very
  deliberately sought to position himself as a leader who can get along with
  Trump while consistently stressing to him Europe’s red lines over any peace
  plan, and trying to sweet-talk the president into offering US security
  guarantees. Recent months have presented several opportunities for Starmer to
  make this case in person, including February’s Oval Office meeting between the
  pair, a bilateral at the G7 in Canada and talks during Trump’s ostensibly
  non-work visit to Scotland last month. Starmer has shown his willingness to
  throw the diplomatic kitchen sink at efforts to keep Trump on side, including
  in February handing the president a written invitation from the king for an
  unusual second state visit. Similarly, the No 10 statement announcing Starmer
  would join the Zelenskyy meeting had more praise for Trump’s “efforts to end
  Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”, even if many UK diplomats would most likely
  privately view Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska as at best
  inconclusive, at worst a Russian trap. Such efforts have yielded results, with
  Trump repeatedly saying how much he likes Starmer, despite their very obvious
  political differences. As with anything Trump-related, even the best-worked
  plans can be upended by events, most spectacularly the way that Starmer’s
  ultra-careful Oval Office appearance was followed a day later by Zelenskyy
  being humiliated by Trump and JD Vance. More recently, Starmer’s delicate
  handling of Trump at the G7 – which in its most visible form saw the PM bend
  down to collect papers spilled by the president – did not prevent Trump
  leaving the summit early and then reneging on a plan to call for restraint in
  tensions between Israel and Iran. Monday’s White House event could go south at
  similar speed, especially given reports that Trump seems minded to take up
  Putin’s suggestion on Ukrainian territorial concessions in exchange for peace,
  something Zelenskyy and other European leaders have consistently ruled out.
  There is an extent to which this does not matter. Any sort of Trump diplomacy
  is always in part an exercise in luck. And as Starmer knows, when dealing with
  Ukraine, even if it does not work, it has to be attempted. Support for Kyiv is
  one of the few remaining cross-party, even national, political consensuses, as
  shown by Starmer and Zelenskyy’s hug outside Downing Street on Thursday, ahead
  of the Alaska summit. While Trump is publicly fussed over by No 10, Zelenskyy
  seems genuinely cherished, as shown by diplomatic symbols such as the
  Ukrainian leader’s post-White House debacle meeting with King Charles at the
  much more intimate surrounding of the royals’ Sandringham estate in Norfolk,
  while Trump will be hosted in September in the formality of Windsor Castle.
  Starmer’s disinclination to publicly criticise Trump, a leader disliked by
  many British voters, can seem anomalous, even jarring. But No 10 can point to
  results, notably the UK’s relatively light treatment under the new regime of
  US tariffs. Pulling Trump out of Putin’s orbit when it comes to peace in
  Ukraine could be a bigger ask. But yet again, Starmer will try.
