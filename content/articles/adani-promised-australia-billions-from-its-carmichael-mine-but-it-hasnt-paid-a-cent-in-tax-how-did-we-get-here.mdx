  Adani promised Australia billions from its Carmichael mine but it hasn’t paid
  a cent in tax. How did we get here?

  It was entirely foreseeable, and has resulted in billions of dollars in
  forgone revenue for Australia. But just how did policymakers fail to extract a
  single cent in company tax from Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, even though it
  opened during the start of a commodity price boom? To understand how it came
  about, you must first rewind to 2010, a period that coincided with a sharp
  escalation in the climate wars that would eventually tear through the
  political corridors of Canberra. Against that backdrop, the Indian
  conglomerate proposed a coalmine to extract up to 60m tonnes per year, for 150
  years, making it one of the world’s biggest. It would also open up the
  untapped Galilee Basin, ushering in a new period of resources prosperity,
  especially for central Queensland. The economic promise was enticing. At its
  peak, such an operation would create more than 10,000 full-time jobs,
  according to an Adani consultant’s report published in 2013. The then head of
  Adani mining, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, said the Australian operations would
  deliver $22bn in taxes and royalties to be invested “right back into frontline
  services”. The “10,000 jobs [and] $22bn in royalties and taxes” pledge became
  a mantra that was even featured in Adani TV advertisements. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email It would be a win-win for the state and federal
  governments – royalties would flow to the state and company tax to the
  commonwealth – both of which needed to issue approvals. Irresistible riches
  The Carmichael emissions would, of course, be colossal, producing 4.7bn tonnes
  of CO2-equivalent over its lifetime, once the mine, its operations and the
  burning of its coal were taken into account, according to analysis by the
  Australia Institute at the time. Annual emissions would be double the average
  produced by Tokyo, and three times that of New Delhi. The ensuing battle
  between environmentalists and the coalminer divided communities; but Adani’s
  jobs and economic benefit pledge seemed irresistible – until it changed. In
  2015, conservationists went to the Queensland land court, seeking a
  recommendation that Adani’s applications for an environmental approval and
  mining lease for Carmichael be refused. The research director at the Australia
  Institute, Rod Campbell, says “Adani’s lawyers realised that the 10,000 jobs
  claim was unsupportable, so they bit the bullet”. Campbell, who provided
  economic analysis for the proceedings opposing Adani, says the coalminer
  changed consultants and argued in court for a more modest jobs claim “but
  otherwise sang the praises of the mine”. The new economic models brought the
  expected job numbers down to fewer than 1,500. By 2015, the anticipated tonnes
  coming out of the mine had also reduced, from 60m a year to 40m; it would
  later reduce to 10m. But the projected corporate tax take still appeared
  strong, with the project forecast to generate about $400m a year under the new
  forecasts. Adani’s modelling was broadly accepted by the court, even though
  critics pointed out it didn’t account for tax minimisation strategies.
  ‘Billions for taxpayers’ By 2017, Adani’s bid for a subsidised commonwealth
  loan was unravelling, and global banks were concerned about the economics and
  reputational damage of funding the new coal project. The mine’s supporters
  doubled down, led by industry groups including the Minerals Council of
  Australia (MCA), which called on policymakers to back the project. The MCA
  chief executive, Tania Constable, said in 2018 the Queensland and Australian
  economies would benefit from thousands of new regional jobs. “And through
  mining taxes and royalties, the Carmichael mine will generate billions of
  dollars for taxpayers over decades to fund nurses, teachers, police,
  hospitals, roads and other services and infrastructure for Queensland families
  and communities,” Constable said. The MCA was contacted for comment. Adani
  would go on to finance the project itself, although it would be a smaller
  project than it had envisaged, given the lack of external funding. “The coal
  will be sold to customers in the Asia-Pacific region at index adjusted
  pricing, which means all taxes and royalties will be paid here in Australia,”
  Adani said in late 2021, after assembling its first shipment of thermal coal
  at the port. ‘Bing, bing, warning bells going off’ The Indian conglomerate
  couldn’t have timed the project any better. In late 2021, prices for energy
  commodities had started to surge in line with the rising tension between
  Russia and Ukraine. Coal prices then spiked to record highs after the Russian
  invasion in early 2022. In its first few months of operation, Adani’s mine
  generated more than $32.5m in revenue, according to accounts lodged with the
  regulator. But it recorded an operating loss after costs, leading to zero tax
  payable. This pattern would repeat, even as revenue increased. In the 2025
  reporting period, it earned $1.27bn in revenue, but once again recorded a
  paper loss, as various related-party transactions and interest payments erased
  profits. Tim Buckley, a former investment banker and the director of Climate
  Energy Finance, describes Adani’s finances as an “extremely complex, opaque
  corporate structure”. Jason Ward, the principal analyst at the Centre for
  International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, says the volume of
  related-party transactions is “pretty unprecedented” and that it is set up to
  never pay tax. “Every page of their financials is like, ‘bing, bing, warning
  bells going off’,” says Ward. Adani has paid royalties – payments made to
  governments to extract state-owned minerals – with a $78.6m payment in the
  2025 accounts, and $83.5m in 2024. Its most recent accounts list just 84
  direct employees at the mine, however it uses a mining services provider to
  hire other workers. A spokesperson for Adani’s Australian mining business,
  which is branded Bravus Mining and Resources, says Adani has invested more
  than $2.5bn into Australia’s economy. “Today, more than 1,200 Queenslanders
  are employed at the Carmichael mine in full-time operational roles to produce
  high-quality thermal coal for the export market,” the Bravus spokesperson
  says. “Developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region use coal from the
  Carmichael mine alongside renewables to provide reliable and affordable energy
  solutions that help reduce poverty and power growth.” While there is no
  suggestion Adani has acted illegally, several politicians have expressed
  frustration that a large resources company can pay less company tax than a
  low-paid worker pays in income tax. The independent senator David Pocock said
  on X: “Why on earth do successive [governments] keep allowing giant
  multinational companies to reap super profits from the sale of our resources
  without paying tax?” Independent MP Zali Steggall says Adani is a “cautionary
  tale”, and that policymakers should reform the approvals process to place
  conditions on miners to meet their stated promises. She says companies
  invariably overstate project benefits which “magically disappear once the
  operations commence, especially when you’re talking about foreign-owned
  corporations”. “Time and time again, we see state and federal ministers and
  governments approve projects on flimsy assurances that don’t come true,” says
  Steggall. “It’s time there was proper accountability for Australian resources
  so that we stop giving it away in the manner we are at the moment.” Jonathan
