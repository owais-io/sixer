  If Rachel Reeves is serious about ensuring that Labour’s second year in power
  is all about a stronger economy that rewards working people across the country
  (In our first year Labour fixed the foundations – now we must build a stronger
  economy for a renewed Britain, 13 August), she needs to rethink what your
  editorial called the UK’s “broken growth model” (6 August). The growth that
  Britain needs is an increase in economic activity that improves social and
  environmental infrastructure nationwide. This involves a huge increase in
  secure, well-paid jobs to rebuild a more resilient future economy. The last
  thing that is required is Reeves’s obsession with more deregulation of the
  City and pressuring savers into investing in the stock market. What is needed
  instead is a massive increase in a socially and green-oriented bond market
  that will provide secure returns for savers. This will require intense
  pressure to be put on Reeves to shift her emphasis away from global financiers
  to recognising UK savers as saviours. She should make clear that in return for
  the tax breaks that those investing in Isas and pensions receive, a
  considerable percentage of such savings would be invested in green and social
  infrastructure projects. This would help tackle the climate crisis and rebuild
  our economy as well as the crumbling cohesion of our society. Colin Hines
  Convener, Green New Deal Group • Rachel Reeves wants to solve Britain’s
  productivity problem by kickstarting economic growth. Four decades ago,
  Britain decided to become a consumer economy when others chose to be
  investment economies. The mistake in tackling the fallout of the global
  financial crisis after 2008 was to slash capital spending at a time when money
  was cheap. The chaotic governments of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss created
  damaging uncertainty for investors. The world has become more uncertain, but
  political decisions also mean growth each year was on average twice as strong
  in the 16 years before the financial crisis than in the 16 years since,
  taxation as a proportion of GDP has reached historic highs and productivity is
  painfully weak. The chancellor needs to be bold and ambitious for Britain’s
  economy. We must exploit the opportunities of the digital revolution, advance
  our skills base, join up government so that departments are all focused on
  growth and become a true investment economy at last. Prof Stephen Barber
  University of East London • Rachel Reeves claims to have fixed the country’s
  financial foundations in Labour’s first year in office, but I am certain that
  the 4.5 million children still living in poverty, an increase of 100,000 from
  the previous year, wouldn’t agree. At the same time, UK billionaires’ wealth
  increased by £35m a day to £182bn, with Britain having the highest proportion
  of billionaire wealth derived from monopolies and cronyism among G7 countries.
  Dr Michael Symonds Emeritus professor, University of Nottingham • No, you
  haven’t “fixed the foundations”, chancellor. Where are the Labour values in
  “renewal is our mission and productivity is our challenge”? Not a word about
  redressing the wealth gap between the rich and the poor; not a word about
  ending the two-child benefit cap; not a word about restoring the level of
  overseas aid. Rachel Reeves’s article could have been written by George
  Osborne – and I for one fear what else that might entail for our dilapidated
  public space. It isn’t good enough just to be wealthy – it’s what you do with
  it and how fairly you spread it that counts. That is supposed to be the Labour
  difference. Hugh D Bryant Penarth, Glamorgan • I find it disappointing that
  Rachel Reeves refers only to “working people”. This indicates that she is not
  considering other groups such as pensioners, or those who cannot work either
  through disability or because of a lack of suitable jobs for which they are
  qualified. She refuses to target the super-rich, preferring to hit easy
  targets by keeping the two-child benefit cap, not raising tax thresholds
  (pushing more people into paying tax and higher tax) and targeting cash Isa
  allowances. Some people have had bad experiences with stocks and shares and
  are reluctant to risk their savings again. She has not learned at least two
  things from history: first, trickle-down economics does not work, as wealth
  floods into foreign tax havens, not to the less well off. And second, removing
  restrictions on the financial sector leads to people and financial
  organisations being overstretched and a banking crisis. Keith Eves Mold,
  Flintshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
