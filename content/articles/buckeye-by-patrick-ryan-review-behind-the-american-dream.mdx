  I am not the kind of reader who naturally gravitates toward slice-of-life
  Americana. I’m an enthusiast for the sort of American fiction where cowboys
  make dolent pronouncements while staring into fires, sure – but less the kind
  where people are generally nice, and go to places called things like “Fink’s
  Drugstore” to drink “root beer floats”. So when Buckeye – the new novel from
  American author Patrick Ryan, whose collections of short fiction have garnered
  comparisons to William Faulkner and JD Salinger – clunked obstreperously on to
  my doorstep, I thought “you’ve got to respect a 440-pager”, and somewhat
  reluctantly pulled my little socks up for some Norman Rockwell-type business.
  And you know what? I now think slice-of-life Americana is good, actually.
  Opening in the first decades of the 20th century, this luminous and tender
  novel follows, for most of its stately length, the interwoven lives of two
  married couples in the fictional town of Bonhomie, Ohio. One half of the first
  of these couples is Cal Jenkins, the sweet-tempered son of a traumatised first
  world war veteran, born in the spring of 1920 with (to use the parlance of the
  era) a mild deformity: “The day you were born and one of your legs came up
  short,” his father, Everett, tells him, “right then I thought, well, that’s
  it. If we get into another big one, he’ll never be in it.” The delights of
  prolepsis! The US gets into another big one in quite short order, of course.
  Cal, just as his father predicted, is turned away from the recruitment office
  and ends up spending his days in drudgery at the local concrete factory
  instead. A chance meeting with Becky Hanover, a young woman with a dark bob
  and a loveably whimsical way about her, sees Cal married by the end of the
  first chapter. After all, Bonhomie is a small town, “hers was the first beret
  he’d ever seen that wasn’t on someone in a movie”, and we’ve got 50-odd years
  of American history to get through. On 8 May 1945, Cal is working a shift at
  the hardware store owned by Becky’s father when a gorgeous, confused redhead
  stumbles in. Together, they listen to President Truman announce allied victory
  in Europe over the wireless – and then she kisses him. The gorgeous, confused
  redhead is Margaret Salt. Her own equally gorgeous and strangely aloof husband
  is away on a cargo ship in the Pacific. From here, the novel takes off at full
  thrust, and, as one of Ryan’s characters summarises it: “people get laid,
  babies get made, everybody lies to their kids”. It is no surprise that Ryan
  cut his teeth writing short fiction: Buckeye is elevated throughout by the
  precision with which he captures the tiny, haunting glories of everyday
  suburban life. We have a mother-in-law with a singing voice so beautiful it
  silences the room, like “throwing a blanket over a birdcage”; a newborn baby
  peering up at his father “in a single-brow-lifting, James Cagney kind of way”;
  a Japanese submarine, recovered from Pearl Harbor and taken on tour through
  the snowbound midwestern winter, “ringing dull and hollow under the pummel of
  mittens”. Across this intimidatingly weighty novel, I encountered only one
  duff simile (and it would feel churlish to retype it here). For all its
  quotidian charm, a deep melancholy prevents Buckeye from ever tipping into
  saccharine nostalgia. I’d probably not go quite so far as to bring Faulkner
  into it – this is accessible, amicable and more-or-less conventional literary
  fiction – but nonetheless, Ryan writes his wounded souls with the same
  exactitude as his dusty vinyl diner booths. His Bonhomie is peopled by men
  almost universally traumatised by their experiences of war. “Life chewed you
  up and spat you out,” Cal thinks, when he turns his mind to his home town’s
  many eccentric veterans, whose company he has been fatefully excluded from,
  “but it didn’t often spit the same way twice”. “Women had the babies, and men
  … began to distance themselves the moment they pulled out,” Margaret thinks,
  “because they had to go to a wife, or to work, or to war, or to that secret
  place of stoic brooding all men are given the key to at birth.” Ryan’s
  characters are universally nuanced and finely wrought, their gently
  interpolated inner monologues giving the lie to the pleasant respectability
  they strive to project. As the years tick by and we enter the 60s, Cal is a
  father – and prolepsis becomes a crueller mistress. So much for Norman
  Rockwell, who is invoked almost as the artistic antithesis of Buckeye’s
  project. “[Rockwell] was always capturing the perfect moments then putting
  them under a microscope to find the cute parts … nothing was like those
  paintings.” Ryan, unlike Rockwell, is not interested in cute. With Buckeye, he
  strips away the Bakelite glaze of the American dream to expose the raw flesh
  beneath. • Buckeye by Patrick Ryan is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99). To
