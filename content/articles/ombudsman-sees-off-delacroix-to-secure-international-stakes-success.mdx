  A summer of odd and muddling Group One races continued as Ombudsman, the
  favourite, eventually stayed on well through the final furlong to win the
  International Stakes by three and a half lengths, after Birr Castle, the 150-1
  pacemaker, had straightened up for home with a 20-length lead. It was an
  ultimately convincing success for a high-class and still-improving
  four-year-old, who did not see a racecourse until June 2024 but, less than a
  month after Qirat’s 150-1 win in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, it was not an
  easy watch. Rab Havlin did not set a tearaway pace on Birr Castle but when
  Keita Tosaki, on the Japanese-trained Danon Decile, reined back at an early
  stage and stacked up the remaining runners behind him, the outsider soon
  acquired a huge lead. He eventually finished third behind Ombudsman and
  Delacroix, the market leaders, a clear sign that Havlin’s fractions had not
  been overblown. “We’ve had a couple of races this season where we’ve probably
  wished we had one,” William Buick, Ombudsman’s jockey, said of the pacemaker,
  “especially the Eclipse [when Delacroix beat Ombudsman by a neck], and today
  we weren’t going to make that mistake again. “Birr Castle is a proper stakes
  horse, and if you give a horse like that a lead on a flat track like York,
  it’s always a danger. So I was thinking: ‘This is a bit dangerous,’ and I was
  hoping Danon Decile would cut the deficit, because he’s proven over further.
  “I had to cut the deficit myself and then he [Ombudsman] went again, which is
  a hard thing to do. To still have that finish in him at the end of the race
  was amazing.” The Irish Champion Stakes, in September, and the Champion Stakes
  at Ascot in October are obvious targets for Ombudsman, although the Prix de
  l’Arc de Triomphe, over an extra furlong and a half, is another option that
  John Gosden, his trainer, did not entirely rule out. “William thinks he’ll
  stay a mile and a half but I think why change things?” Gosden said. “Were he
  to go for the Arc, we’d need one of the rare occasions with a fast-ground
  Arc.” The Arc de Triomphe is no longer in play for Pride Of Arras, however, as
  the winner of the Great Voltigeur Stakes earlier on the card has been gelded
  since running poorly in the Irish Derby in June. Pride Of Arras is also barred
  from the St Leger at Doncaster next month, but there was still an eye-catching
  trial for the final Classic in Wednesday’s race as Carmers, the Queen’s Vase
  winner at Royal Ascot in June, stayed on well to finish second after being
  outpaced halfway down the straight. Paddy Twomey’s colt is still available at
  double-figure odds for the Leger and that seems sure to be his next start. “I
  think he’s learned more today than in any race he’s won,” the trainer said.
  “It’s a big run and back up to a mile and six will suit him.” Thursday tips:
  Minnie Hauk odds-on for treble Thursday’s four-runner Yorkshire Oaks is in
  effect dead as a betting race as Minnie Hauk (3.35), the Oaks winner in
  England and Ireland, will set off at around 1-3 to complete a Group One treble
  in the feature event on day two of York’s Ebor meeting. Aidan O’Brien, her
  trainer, completed the same treble with Snowfall in 2021, and is looking for
  his fifth win in the race in the past six seasons. The locally trained
  Estrange is her only significant rival on form and deserves this tilt at a
  Group One after taking the Lancashire Oaks last time out, but it will be a
  considerable surprise if Minnie Hauk, already the second-favourite for the
  Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, does not take another positive step towards the
  Paris showpiece in October. York 1.50 America Queen is a fascinating unknown
  quantity after a devastating 12-length debut success at Haydock last month,
  but the timefigure for the race was only so-so and Ed Walker’s Royal Fixation
  has more solid credentials after a close second in the Group Two Duchess of
  Cambridge Stakes at Newmarket’s July meeting. York 2.25 Richard Hannon landed
  this hugely valuable two-year-old prize five times in seven years from 2016 to
  2022 and the conditions favour Raakeb as he seeks to make it six from 10 for
  the yard. He gets a useful 7lb from the subsequent Group Three winner Tadej,
  who was just in front of him in the Coventry at Royal Ascot. York 3.00 A host
  of possibilities in what is often as competitive a handicap as the Ebor itself
  but Apiarist has taken a slightly unusual route to the race and may have been
  slightly overlooked in the market as a result. Kevin Ryan’s four-year-old has
  done most of his winning on the all-weather, but he was a course winner as a
  juvenile, ran well on firm ground at Ascot in June and was an eye-catcher in a
  valuable seven-furlong handicap at the Galway Festival this month. He was the
  strongest finisher of all after finding trouble in running on the home turn,
  and is an interesting each-way option at around 12-1 from a handy draw in
  stall seven. York 4.10 There are two runners in the royal colours in this
  Listed event for fillies and mares and, while Rainbows Edge is favoured in the
  betting after a close second at this track last time out, William Haggas’s
  Aeolian looks more likely to improve for this step up to a mile and a half.
