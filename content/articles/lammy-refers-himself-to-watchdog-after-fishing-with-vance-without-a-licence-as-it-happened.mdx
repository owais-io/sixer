  That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog for
  today. Thank you for following along. The blog will be back tomorrow at the
  usual time but, for now, stay informed of all the latest UK politics news
  here. Goodnight. David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog
  because he did not have a rod licence to go fishing with JD Vance. The foreign
  secretary failed to catch any fish when he hosted the US vice-president at his
  grace-and-favour retreat at Chevening House, Kent. Anglers in England and
  Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod licence to fish for freshwater species,
  such as carp, according to the Environment Agency. Donald Trump’s
  interventions over the Ukraine war have created a “viable” chance of a
  ceasefire but the UK stands ready to “increase pressure” on Russia if
  necessary, Keir Starmer has said. In a call with allies on Wednesday, the
  prime minister said the meeting between the US president and Russian leader
  Vladimir Putin is “hugely important” with the prospect of a truce in sight, PA
  reported. Keir Starmer has said that plans have already been formed to deploy
  a “reassurance force” once a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia has been
  agreed. The prime minister said the UK was also drawing up further sanctions
  on Russia as part of an attempt to squeeze Vladimir Putin. The next mass
  protest in support of the banned group Palestine Action will aim to be twice
  the size of the last, organisers have said, as they increase pressure on the
  government to lift its proscription. Last Saturday’s protest in Parliament
  Square was predicated on 500 people signing up but the next one, announced on
  Wednesday for 6 September, is conditional on 1,000 people agreeing to take
  part. Keir Starmer is to formally revive Northern Powerhouse rail this autumn
  with an announcement expected before the Labour conference, as a major
  demonstration of Labour’s commitment to northern infrastructure. Sources said
  the speech would be delivered by both Starmer and Rachel Reeves as they
  attempt to show their commitment to Labour’s former heartlands across the
  north of England, where Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is eyeing significant gains
  at the next general election. Prime minister Keir Starmer has paid tribute to
  Welsh Labour politician Hefin David, describing him as a “powerful voice for
  the people of Wales and a committed public servant”. Backbench politician
  David died suddenly, the first minister of Wales confirmed on Wednesday
  shortly before midday. Eluned Morgan, the Welsh Labour leader, paid tribute to
  the Caerphilly MS, who has been a member of the Welsh parliament since 2016.
  The Treasury is looking at ways to increase the money it collects through
  inheritance tax (IHT), sources have told the Guardian. Ideas on the table
  include a review of the rules on giving away assets, with one possibility
  being the introduction of a lifetime cap on how much an individual can donate.
  Yvette Cooper insisted there would be “safeguards and protections” governing
  the use of live facial recognition as she was questioned about whether its
  deployment could infringe on privacy. The vitriol faced by scouts and charity
  rowers mistaken for migrants was not an “innocent mistake”, a race equality
  campaigner has said, as she warned that toxic rhetoric could lead to more
  vigilantism and violence. A wave of anti-migrant protests outside asylum
  hotels in recent weeks has been followed by growing reports of vigilantism,
  with people facing abuse after being mistaken for migrants. Scotland would
  have a stronger economy and would be richer if the UK government allowed
  greater immigration and rejoined the EU, Shona Robison, the Scottish finance
  secretary said after the country’s fiscal deficit grew. Robison said the
  growing deficit, which reached £26.5bn or 11.4% of Scotland’s GDP in 2024/25,
  was partly attributable to the economic damage caused by Brexit and the
  impacts of strict immigration controls on Scotland’s population. The Scottish
  Greens have to broaden their appeal beyond middle-class urbanites by talking
  to voters in industrial towns facing wholesale job losses, a Green leadership
  candidate has said. Gillian Mackay is one of four Scottish Greens bidding to
  win two co-leader posts after Patrick Harvie, the UK’s longest-serving party
  leader, quit as co-convener earlier this year. A group of nine human rights
  and freedom of expression organisations have called on the culture secretary
  to halt RedBird Capital’s proposed £500m takeover of the Telegraph and
  investigate the US private equity company’s ties to China. The international
  non-governmental organisations, which include Index on Censorship, Reporters
  Without Borders and Article 19, have written to Lisa Nandy arguing that
  RedBird Capital’s links with China “threaten media pluralism, transparency and
  information integrity in the UK”. A Chinese firm is reportedly a leading
  contender to buy Thames Water if the heavily indebted company collapses in
  coming weeks. Hong Kong’s CKI, which invests in power and other utility
  companies in the UK, is among those lining up to acquire the water and
  sewerage supplier if it enters a special administration regime (SAR),
  according to the Times. The Trump administration has accused the UK of
  backsliding on human rights over the past year, citing antisemitic violence
  and “serious restrictions” on free speech. The annual US state department
  assessment, which analyses human rights conditions worldwide, highlighted laws
  limiting speech around abortion clinics, as well as the way government
  officials “repeatedly intervened to chill speech” online after the 2024
  Southport attack. Disinformation could still spread around suspects arrested
  under new guidance for police, a minister has said, reports the PA news
  agency. Police forces have been told to share suspects’ ethnicity and
  nationality with the public after authorities were accused of covering up
  offences carried out by asylum seekers, and after riots following the
  Southport murders which were partly fuelled by social media disinformation.
  The Scottish Greens have to broaden their appeal beyond middle-class urbanites
  by talking to voters in industrial towns facing wholesale job losses, a Green
  leadership candidate has said. Gillian Mackay is one of four Scottish Greens
  bidding to win two co-leader posts after Patrick Harvie, the UK’s
  longest-serving party leader, quit as co-convener earlier this year. The
  pro-independence Scottish Greens are currently Holyrood’s fourth largest
  party, with seven MSPs, and could play a key role in the devolved parliament
  after next year’s elections. The Greens prop up the Scottish National party
  government in Edinburgh, which does not have a majority at Holyrood and is
  expected to form a minority administration again next year. Recent polls place
  the Greens as high as 15%, suggesting they could win several more seats.
  Mackay said her area around Falkirk had been devastated by industrial decline,
  including the closure of Grangemouth oil refinery earlier this year, yet the
  Scottish Greens historically had failed to connect with local voters. The
  Scottish and UK governments knew Grangemouth would close, affecting several
  thousand jobs in the region, but had failed to put in place an industrial
  strategy to guarantee green jobs, she said. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer has said
  that plans have already been formed to deploy a “reassurance force” once a
  ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia has been agreed. The prime minister said
  the UK was also drawing up further sanctions on Russia as part of an attempt
  to squeeze Vladimir Putin. He said: “We’ve made some real progress today. A
  very important call with president Trump earlier on in relation to security
  guarantees, as Emmanuel [Macron] has just set out. As we’ve said all along, we
  the coalition, stepping up, showing what we will do, but plans we’ve put
  forward, credible military plans alongside that with the backing of the US. We
  stand ready as a coalition to support the meeting on Friday and everything I
  hope can flow out of it.” He added: “We’re ready to support this, including
  through the plans that we’ve already drawn up to deploy a reassurance force
  once hostilities have ceased. It is important to remind colleagues that we do
  stand ready also to increase pressure on Russia, particularly the economy,
  with sanctions and wider measures as necessary. “You can see the effect of
  those measures already, and we in the UK are preparing our next packages of
  strong sanctions in that regard.” US vice-president JD Vance has said the UK
  and the US “make it easier to achieve peace and prosperity all over the
  world”. In a speech to American troops stationed in the UK, he said: “If you
  look at the long sweep of history, every time something big happens for the
  world, every time a great victory is won for freedom and for peace and for
  prosperity, it is almost always the Brits and the Americans that do it
  together, and we win every single time we go to war together. You guys know
  that as well as anybody. “But it’s not just about going to war, and it’s not
  just winning when we do. “When we work together, when we fight together, when
  we make it clear that we always approach every situation with an open hand -
  but if things go poorly, we’re willing to do what we have to do - we make it
  easier to achieve peace and prosperity all over the world.” Donald Trump’s
  interventions over the Ukraine war have created a “viable” chance of a
  ceasefire but the UK stands ready to “increase pressure” on Russia if
  necessary, Keir Starmer has said. In a call with allies on Wednesday, the
  prime minister said the meeting between the US president and Russian leader
  Vladimir Putin is “hugely important” with the prospect of a truce in sight, PA
  reported. Co-chairing a meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” -
  a European-led effort to prepare a peacekeeping force to monitor any potential
  ceasefire in Ukraine - Starmer said: “This meeting on Friday that president
  Trump is attending is hugely important. “As I’ve said firstly to president
  Trump for the three-and-a-bit years this conflict has been going on, we
  haven’t got anywhere near a prospect of actually a viable solution, a viable
  way of bringing it to a ceasefire. “And now we have that chance, because of
  the work of the president.” The UK readout from the European leaders’ call
  issued by Keir Starmer’s spokesperson stressed the “unwavering” support for
  Ukraine as the leaders “agreed this week marks an important moment for the
  future of Ukraine,” and thanked US president Donald Trump “for his efforts in
  bringing Putin to the table in pursuit of a ceasefire to end to the ongoing
  bloodshed.” The statement added: “The prime minister was clear that our
  support for Ukraine is unwavering – international borders must not be changed
  by force and Ukraine must have robust and credible security guarantees to
  defend its territorial integrity as part of any deal. “Europe stands ready to
  support this and will continue to work alongside president Trump and President
  Zelenskyy for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine …” It noted that the leaders
  would speak again after Friday. Britain’s data protection watchdog has warned
  facial recognition does not operate in a “legal vacuum” and police must use it
  with “appropriate safeguards”, as it prepares to share findings from an audit
  of two Welsh forces. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office
  said: “Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) does not operate in a legal vacuum.
  “It is covered by data protection law, which requires any use of personal
  data, including biometric data, to be lawful, fair and proportionate. “When
  used by the police, FRT must be deployed in a way that respects people’s
  rights and freedoms, with appropriate safeguards in place. “FRT is a priority
  for the ICO due to its potential benefits and risks. “We play an important
  role ensuring police are compliant with data protection law and that people’s
  rights are protected, including by providing clear guidance on the use of FRT
  and undertaking regular audits of police forces, so that the public can have
  confidence in how the technology is used. “We have recently concluded our
  audit of South Wales Police and Gwent Police and will be sharing our findings
  shortly.” The next mass protest in support of the banned group Palestine
  Action will aim to be twice the size of the last, organisers have said, as
  they increase pressure on the government to lift its proscription. Last
  Saturday’s protest in Parliament Square was predicated on 500 people signing
  up but the next one, announced on Wednesday for 6 September, is conditional on
  1,000 people agreeing to take part. Defend Our Juries, the pressure group
  behind the protests opposing the proscription of Palestine Action, said it
  believed a turnout of 1,000 would be enough to get the ban lifted. A total of
  532 people were arrested at Saturday’s demonstration, all but 10 under section
  13 of the Terrorism Act for carrying placards saying: “I oppose genocide, I
  support Palestine Action.” The number of people arrested for peaceful
  protests, their age profile – half of those arrested were 60 or older – and
  the strain it is putting on the criminal justice system have led many to
  question the ban. A Defend Our Juries spokesperson said: With all the real
  challenges facing the country, it’s crazy that the Labour government has
  generated a political crisis over people quietly holding cardboard signs
  against genocide in Parliament Square. This won’t be forgotten. The vitriol
  faced by scouts and charity rowers mistaken for migrants was not an “innocent
  mistake”, a race equality campaigner has said, as she warned that toxic
  rhetoric could lead to more vigilantism and violence. A wave of anti-migrant
  protests outside asylum hotels in recent weeks has been followed by growing
  reports of vigilantism, with people facing abuse after being mistaken for
  migrants. Police have launched an investigation into an incident at a scout
  camp in Wales, where children were allegedly filmed and subjected to racial
  abuse amid unfounded speculation the site was being used to house immigrants.
  Last week, Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe – formerly of Reform UK, now an
  independent – was accused of being part of a vigilante effort after he
  reported a charity rowing crew he mistakenly thought were possible “illegal
  migrants”. “We’re in a really dangerous situation and the government really
  needs to step up to the challenge,” said Dr Shabna Begum, the chief executive
  of the Runnymede Trust. We’re in quite a desperate place of despair and gloom,
  and that breeds the division and type of activity that we’re seeing. We are
  looking at a really bleak future where, if the government doesn’t address some
  of the deep-seated inequalities in the country, we are likely to see more of
  these vigilante groups, which just breed more violence. Reports of a vigilante
  group in Bournemouth have been met with alarm. More than 200 residents have
  supposedly signed up to Safeguard Force, which claims it will carry out
  uniformed patrols in the seaside town to protect “women, children and the
  elderly”. Begum said this type of behaviour had been triggered by a “breakdown
  of the social contract” and a failure of politicians to deal with economic
  deprivation. Keir Starmer has spoken with his Dutch counterpart Dick Schoof
  and agreed “there should be no decisions about the future of Ukraine without
  Ukraine” in a call on Wednesday, Downing Street said. A Number 10 spokesperson
  said: The prime minister spoke to the prime minister of the Netherlands Dick
  Schoof earlier today. They discussed their sustained support for Ukraine and
  the ongoing work to end Russia’s barbaric war. They agreed that there should
  be no decisions about the future of Ukraine without Ukraine. They looked
  forward to discussing further in this afternoon’s meetings alongside President
  Trump and President Zelensky. It was a celebratory multimillion pound scheme
  to mark the beginning of King Charles III’s reign. Free portraits of the king
  were offered to all public bodies – every town hall, university, hospital and
  even jobcentre – so the new monarch’s visage could gaze down on his subjects.
  The initiative would provide “a reminder of the example set by our ultimate
  public servant”, said the then Tory deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden. But
  the current government is proving coy about where exactly any of the images of
  King Charles ended up after it admitted more than 46,000 public institutions
  had showed no interest. In what has been described as an “absurd” decision
  about a scheme to distribute large portraits of the king to be hung in public
  view, it is refusing to say which schools, hospitals and job centres did
  request them, saying it could “give rise to controversy” and create “negative
  public perception”. More than £2.7m was spent meeting requests for the
  pictures and while take-up was patchy, more than 20,000 images of Charles in a
  medal-laden Royal Navy uniform were sent out – a 31% hit rate. But the
  reluctance to reveal where they ended up has emerged from a Guardian freedom
  of information request which the Cabinet Office has been resisting for many
  months. Last October it rejected the request for the information by arguing
  disclosure would be an “actionable breach of confidence”. In effect it implied
  a public authority which requested a portrait of the king to display in public
  might sue the government for revealing that it had done so. When the Guardian
  appealed on the grounds that “requesting a portrait of the king funded by the
  taxpayer for the express purpose of being publicly displayed cannot reasonably
  be considered a confidential matter”, it dropped that justification and
  changed tack to claim release would “prejudice the effective conduct of public
  affairs”, a different exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. It said
  disclosure “would be likely to trigger questions about why certain
  organisations requested the portrait and (by extension) why others did not”
  and that organisations would be distracted from operational activity by having
  to answer them. The Treasury is looking at ways to increase the money it
  collects through inheritance tax (IHT), sources have told the Guardian. Ideas
  on the table include a review of the rules on giving away assets, with one
  possibility being the introduction of a lifetime cap on how much an individual
  can donate. Any changes would come on top of other moves the government has
  already made to close IHT loopholes. The Guardian’s money and consumer editor,
  Hilary Osborne, has written this explainer on how IHT works and what might be
  changing: Keir Starmer is to formally revive Northern Powerhouse rail this
  autumn with an announcement expected before the Labour conference, as a major
  demonstration of Labour’s commitment to northern infrastructure. Sources said
  the speech would be delivered by both Starmer and Rachel Reeves as they
  attempt to show their commitment to Labour’s former heartlands across the
  north of England, where Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is eyeing significant gains
  at the next general election. Government advisers are planning to time the
  announcement before Labour conference on 28 September, with the aim of
  boosting the morale of backbenchers after a series of damaging U-turns. The
  transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, is expected to make the rail project a
  key theme of her conference speech. A government source said the announcement
  was likely to take place before then but that the timing was not yet
  confirmed. Political and industry figures in the north of England have urged
  Starmer for over a year to revive the Manchester leg of HS2 and to build
  Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), an east-west connection linking Liverpool to
  Hull. NPR is seen by some as critical to rebalancing the UK’s economy as it
  would connect potentially five of Britain’s major cities – including Leeds,
  Bradford and Sheffield – on a route that for decades has been choked by
  trundling old trains and the overloaded M62. A DfT source said the exact route
  had not yet been formally agreed. The NPR plan requires part of the HS2
  construction between Crewe and Manchester to go ahead, also raising hopes that
  ministers would also commit to some form of HS2 running to Birmingham and
  London. David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog because
  he did not have a rod licence to go fishing with JD Vance. The foreign
  secretary failed to catch any fish when he hosted the US vice-president at his
  grace-and-favour retreat at Chevening House, Kent. Anglers in England and
  Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod licence to fish for freshwater species,
  such as carp, according to the Environment Agency. “The foreign secretary has
  written to the Environment Agency over an administrative oversight that meant
  the appropriate licences had not been acquired for fishing on a private lake
  as part of a diplomatic engagement at Chevening House last week,” a Foreign
  Office spokesperson said. “As soon as the foreign secretary was made aware of
  the administrative error, he successfully purchased the relevant rod fishing
  licences. “He also wrote to the Environment Agency notifying them of the
  error, demonstrating how it would be rectified, and thanking them for their
  work protecting Britain’s fisheries.” Scotland would have a stronger economy
  and would be richer if the UK government allowed greater immigration and
  rejoined the EU, Shona Robison, the Scottish finance secretary said after the
  country’s fiscal deficit grew. Robison said the growing deficit, which reached
  £26.5bn or 11.4% of Scotland’s GDP in 2024/25, was partly attributable to the
  economic damage caused by Brexit and the impacts of strict immigration
  controls on Scotland’s population. Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh after
  the new economic data was published, Robison said: The UK government’s current
  approach to the economy does not benefit Scotland. Its approach to
  immigration, for example, harms Scotland by failing to address our demographic
  and economic needs, and it’s failing to deliver the investment needed, with
  our capital budget set to fall in real terms over the coming years. And that’s
  before we go into the effects of Brexit, which is estimated to have reduced
  our revenue by £2.3 billion. Both those policies would be reversed if Scotland
  were independent, Robison said. She claimed the positive effects of
  independence would kick in on “day one”. It would, however, take some years
  for Scotland to rejoin the EU, and to unpick all Scotland’s complex links with
  the UK. Most economists, including those used previously by the Scottish
  National party government, predict an independent government would need to
  make swingeing spending cuts or significantly raise taxes in order to close
  the fiscal gap. The new government expenditure and revenue Scotland (GERS)
  report for 2024/25 said that overall, the UK and Scottish governments raised
  £91.4bn in taxes in Scotland but spent £117.6bn – a figure which includes
  Scotland’s notional share of spending in other parts of the UK or overseas in
  areas such as defence, trade and foreign affairs. Robison also acknowledged
  Scotland had to rely much less on North Sea oil and gas revenues, which were
  rapidly dwindling, if it became independent. GERS said that excluding oil
  revenues in 2024/25, Scotland’s notional fiscal deficit rose to £30.6bn, or
  14.45 of GDP – far higher than the EU would accept if Scotland tried to become
  a member. The former judge leading the public inquiry into the death of a
  black man in custody has refused to step down after the Scottish Police
  Federation and Scotland’s solicitor general accused him of bias. Responding to
  Lord Bracadale’s decision to remain in post, the lawyer for the family of
  Sheku Bayoh, who died in Kirkcaldy in 2015 after he was forcibly restrained by
  officers, in turn accused the federation of “a deliberate and cynical attempt
  to evade scrutiny”. Aamer Anwar, who has represented the Bayoh family for a
  decade, also said that the position of Ruth Charteris, the solicitor general
  who made the unprecedented intervention, was “untenable”. Charteris and the
  federation had argued that Bracadale unfairly held private meetings with the
  Bayoh family, which indicated “apparent bias”, a claim that would have
  significant ramifications for other UK public inquiries if it had been
  accepted. But, after a hearing that cost the taxpayer £2m, he concluded that
  the meetings were “private but not secret” and did not breach the right of
  other participants in the inquiry to be heard. Prime minister Keir Starmer has
  paid tribute to Welsh Labour politician Hefin David, describing him as a
  “powerful voice for the people of Wales and a committed public servant”.
  Backbench politician David died suddenly, the first minister of Wales
  confirmed on Wednesday shortly before midday. Eluned Morgan, the Welsh Labour
  leader, paid tribute to the Caerphilly MS, who has been a member of the Welsh
  parliament since 2016. In a statement after David’s death, Starmer said: The
  entire Labour movement will join me in grieving the loss of Hefin David. He
  was a powerful voice for the people of Wales and a committed public servant,
  who dedicated his life to making sure every person and community in Wales had
  the opportunities and support they deserve. As Member of the Senedd for
  Caerphilly, where he was born and lived, he was incredibly proud of his
  community. Our hearts are with his family and those who knew and loved him at
  this painful time. May he rest in peace. According to the PA news agency, a
  Gwent police spokesperson said: We were called to a report of a medical
  emergency at an address in Nelson at around 6.55pm on Tuesday August 12.
  Officers attended and after entering the property found a 47-year-old man
  unresponsive inside. Paramedics from the Welsh ambulance service also attended
  and confirmed that the man had died; his family are aware and receiving
  support. The death is not viewed as suspicious, and a report will be submitted
  to the coroner in relation to the death. Keir Starmer will be among European
  leaders who will speak with the US president, Donald Trump, and his
  vice-president, JD Vance, today, consulting ahead of this Friday’s summit with
  Russian president Vladimir Putin. Representing Team Europe are the host, the
  German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the
  French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,
  the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, and Starmer. They will be joined by the
  European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council
  president, António Costa, and that famous Trump-whisperer, the Nato secretary
  general, Mark Rutte. They will be also joined by the Ukrainian president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who in a further show of unity with his partners will not
  only be on the call, but will be joining the host in person in Berlin. You can
  follow Jakub Krupa’s updates on this in the Guardian’s Europe live blog:
  Yvette Cooper insisted there would be “safeguards and protections” governing
  the use of live facial recognition as she was questioned about whether its
  deployment could infringe on privacy. The PA news agency reports that when
  Cooper was asked whether the rollout was an infringement on people’s privacy,
  the home secretary said: Well, the way this technology is being used is to
  identify people who are wanted by the court, who maybe should be returned to
  prison, or who have failed to appear before the court, or who have breached
  things like sexual harm prevention orders, so serious criminals. And I think
  being able to identify them, alongside having proper legal safeguards and a
  legal framework in place because there do have to be safeguards and
  protections, but we also need to be able to use the technology to catch
  dangerous criminals and to keep communities safe. The home secretary has
  welcomed guidance for the police that has told them to share suspects’
  ethnicity and nationality with the public, reports the PA news agency. Yvette
  Cooper said the government had been clearer for the need for more openness. It
  comes after authorities were accused of covering up offences carried out by
  asylum seekers, and in the wake of riots after the Southport murders which
  were partly fuelled by social media disinformation. Cooper said: We welcome
  the guidance because this is a step forward, and we have been clear that we
  need greater transparency and that’s what the public want to see. But we have
  also asked the Law Commission, particularly to look at what information can be
  released to make sure that we’re not also affecting criminal trials that are
  under way. That’s where a lot of the restrictions and constraints have been.
  So we’ve asked the Law Commission to report, very quickly, this autumn on what
  more can be done to avoid prejudicing criminal trials. A group of nine human
  rights and freedom of expression organisations have called on the culture
  secretary to halt RedBird Capital’s proposed £500m takeover of the Telegraph
  and investigate the US private equity company’s ties to China. The
  international non-governmental organisations, which include Index on
  Censorship, Reporters Without Borders and Article 19, have written to Lisa
  Nandy arguing that RedBird Capital’s links with China “threaten media
  pluralism, transparency and information integrity in the UK”. A consortium led
  by RedBird Capital agreed a deal in May to buy the Daily Telegraph and Sunday
  Telegraph, ending two years of uncertainty over the future of the titles. The
  organisations said that RedBird Capital’s chair, John Thornton, sits on the
  advisory council of the China Investment Corporation, the country’s largest
  sovereign wealth fund. Thornton, a former chair of Goldman Sachs Asia, has
  also previously chaired the Silk Road Finance Corporation. “Both [are]
  vehicles through which China has pursued financial influence,” the letter
  said. The signatories, who also include Hong Kong Watch, Human Rights in China
  and the Hong Kong Democracy Council, said Nandy should follow her predecessor,
  Lucy Frazer, who issued a public interest intervention notice (PIIN) in
  January last year. Former Holyrood presiding officer George Reid has died at
  the age of 86, his family have announced. He died in the early hours of
  Tuesday at Strathcarron Hospice near Denny, just a few miles from where he was
  born in Clackmannanshire, reports the PA news agency. Flags at the Scottish
  parliament he helped to complete have been lowered as a mark of respect,
  current presiding officer Alison Johnstone announced. First minister John
  Swinney led tributes to Reid, crediting him as being one of the voices that
  brought him into politics as a teenager. “I am desperately saddened by the
  loss of the remarkable George Reid,” the first minister said in a statement on
  Wednesday. He added: His passion for Scotland, his principled internationalist
  worldview, and his empathy for the plight of people everywhere made him a
  voice that could not be ignored across five decades. As an MP, he was a
  trailblazing member of the SNP’s breakthrough victories of 1974. He became,
  for me, one of the compelling voices of the campaign for a Scottish parliament
  in 1979. His was one of the voices that brought me into politics and kindled
  my belief in independence that has driven my adult life. I feel so privileged
  to have been shaped by his influence and inspiration. George was a founding
  member of the Scottish parliament. More than that, after Holyrood’s difficult
  early years, he put aside party and provided emphatic national leadership as
  the presiding officer, ending the controversies over the new building and
  cementing the institution’s place in modern political life. Throughout it all,
  his articulation of the case for Scotland deciding her own future was as
  compelling to me when I sat with him in his home just four short weeks ago, as
  it was when I was a teenager. A Chinese firm is reportedly a leading contender
  to buy Thames Water if the heavily indebted company collapses in coming weeks.
  Hong Kong’s CKI, which invests in power and other utility companies in the UK,
  is among those lining up to acquire the water and sewerage supplier if it
  enters a special administration regime (SAR), according to the Times. It has
  reportedly said it would be prepared to operate under tougher penalties for
  environmental breaches than Thames’s class A creditors, who have put together
  their own purchase bid. The creditor group has said the company cannot afford
  to operate with an expected £1bn of fines coming down the track, which are
  levied by the regulator for breaches such as illegally dumping sewage. In May,
  Thames was hit with a record £104m fine over environmental breaches involving
  sewage spills. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, has in recent months
  stepped up preparations for the possibility of putting Thames into SAR –
  effectively a form of temporary nationalisation. On Tuesday the government
  confirmed it had appointed FTI Consulting to make contingency plans for a
  potential collapse. The appointment indicates that FTI is the first choice to
  act as administrator if the government enacted an SAR, although a court would
  ultimately approve such a step. Thames, which supplies 16 million customers in
  London and south-east England, has been racing to pull together a deal to
  avoid financial collapse. The government has been trying to avoid such an
  outcome, with the Treasury threatening that a potential £4bn bill from the SAR
  could be forced on to Reed’s department. This process would ensure that the
  taps stayed on for customers but would heap immediate costs on to the
  government. However, the government’s Water (Special Measures) Act contains a
  provision for SAR costs to be recouped from customer bills further down the
  line. Responding to reports that Nigel Farage would be meeting US
  vice-president JD Vance today, leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said
  last night: Nigel Farage could use his meeting with JD Vance to tell the White
  House that in Europe we stand together against Putin’s aggression. But Farage
  won’t do that because he’s much more interested in pleasing Trump than in
  standing up for British values and European security. Nasar Meer, a professor
  of social and political sciences at the University of Glasgow, has written an
  opinion piece for the Guardian today on the topic of routinely disclosing the
  ethnicity of police suspects. Supporters say more “transparency” will prevent
  malign forces from flourishing – but the argument is profoundly flawed, he
  writes: In an interview this morning, the policing minister, Diana Johnson,
  said she had seen facial recognition technology in action in Croydon, London,
  where the Metropolitan police had put together a watchlist of wanted
  individuals, and the list was deleted after the exercise. “So it was very
  tailored,” Johnson told BBC Breakfast. She added: There are laws about how
  this has to be done in terms of human rights, equalities law, data protection
  laws. I think one of the concerns people, perhaps rightly, have is the need to
  consolidate that into one piece of legislation or one law, and that’s
  something we’re going to consult on later in the year, about how live facial
  recognition technology should be used and the oversight of it to make it as
  transparent as possible for the public to really feel this is something that
  the police are using properly. Johnson had earlier told Times Radio: There is
  quite a lot of misinformation out there about what this actually does and how
  it’s used. She said: And I know in the past, there’ve been concerns about
  bias, particularly around certain ethnic groups or genders or age. And the way
  that this is now structured, the algorithms that are being used have been
  independently tested, so I’m confident that the live facial recognition that
  we’re rolling out today actually is within the law and does not have the bias
  that has happened previously. According to the Home Office, the technology
  will be used to track down high-harm offenders. Seven English forces will have
  access to 10 vans equipped with cameras, across Greater Manchester, West
  Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and Hampshire,
  following on from recent deployments by London’s Met police and South Wales
  police, reports the PA news agency. Ch Supt Tim Morgan of South Wales police
  said the technology had “never resulted in a wrongful arrest in south Wales,
  and there have been no false alerts for several years as the technology and
  our understanding has evolved”. But human rights campaigners have “concerns”
  about “this incredibly intrusive technology”, Shami Chakrabarti, a former
  director of the civil liberties advocacy group Liberty, told BBC Radio 4’s
  Today programme. The former shadow attorney general said: Some would say this
  is yet another move towards a total surveillance society – challenges to
  privacy, challenges to freedom of assembly and association, and problems with
  race and sex discrimination because of the higher likelihood of false matches
  in the context of certain groups. She said that “the public generally
  understand that police powers are governed by statute, so there’s a public
  conversation, there are parliamentary debates and votes”, but warned there was
  no law specifically covering live facial recognition to gather evidence. “It’s
  particularly odd that this has all been developed pretty much completely
  outside the law,” she said. Chakrabarti said she “welcomed” plans to consult
  ahead of possible new legislation, but warned that to date, “it’s been a bit
  of a wild west – the police procuring technology from whichever companies they
  see fit, the police drawing up watchlists of who they’re looking for and what
  level, what severity of crime should be sufficient for deployment, and pretty
  much marking their own homework”. The gap between public spending and taxes in
  Scotland has grown sharply to more than £26bn, leaving it with a deficit twice
  as large as the UK’s, official data shows. The latest annual report on
  Scottish expenditure and tax revenues shows the notional fiscal deficit – the
  gap between overall spending and overall tax receipts – stood at 11.7% of
  Scottish GDP in the last financial year. The UK’s deficit was 5.1% for
  2024/25, and the revenue gap has grown in Scotland. In the previous year, it
  stood at 9.7% of GDP. Those figures, which include all types of spending and
  tax raising by both the Scottish and UK governments, include Scotland’s
  notional share of revenues from North Sea oil and gas. Those fell last year,
  contributing to the increasing fiscal gap. Overall, the two governments raised
  £91.4bn in taxes but spent £117.6bn – a figure which includes Scotland’s
  notional share of spending in other parts of the UK or overseas in areas such
  as defence, trade and foreign affairs. The Scottish government said these
  annual accounts, part of the Government expenditure and revenue Scotland
  (GERS) series, showed that domestic tax receipts grew faster than all devolved
  government spending and social security spending for the fourth year running.
  The data has continuing significance because the Scottish National party
  government in Edinburgh plans to make independence part of next year’s
  devolved elections again. Scotland’s ability to finance its spending
  independently is a crucial issue in that debate. Shona Robison, the Scottish
  finance secretary, said: The decisions we have taken here in Scotland are
  helping support sustainable public finances. Scotland’s public finances are
  better than many other parts of the UK, with the third highest revenue per
  person in the UK, behind only London and the south-east. Ian Murray, the
  secretary of state for Scotland, who represents the UK government, said: These
  figures underline the collective economic strength of the United Kingdom and
  how Scotland benefits from the redistribution of wealth inside the UK. By
  sharing resources with each other across the UK, Scots benefit by £2,669 more
  per head in public spending than the UK average. It also means that devolved
  governments have the financial heft of the wider UK behind them when taking
  decisions. The Trump administration has accused the UK of backsliding on human
  rights over the past year, citing antisemitic violence and “serious
  restrictions” on free speech. The annual US state department assessment, which
  analyses human rights conditions worldwide, highlighted laws limiting speech
  around abortion clinics, as well as the way government officials “repeatedly
  intervened to chill speech” online after the 2024 Southport attack. The report
  stated: The government sometimes took credible steps to identify and punish
  officials who committed human rights abuses, but prosecution and punishment
  for such abuses was inconsistent. The report cited the “safe access zones”
  around abortion clinics, which it said “could include prohibitions on efforts
  to influence … even through prayer or silent protests”. Criticism over the
  handling of free speech – in particular relating to regulations on online hate
  speech – was also directed at the governments of Germany and France. A UK
  government spokesperson said: Free speech is vital for democracy around the
  world, including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst
  keeping our citizens safe. The document, previously seen as the most
  comprehensive study of its kind, has been significantly rewritten and
  downscaled by the Trump administration, including in areas such as government
  corruption and LGBTQ+ rights. It spares criticism for US allies such as Israel
  and El Salvador while escalating disapproval of perceived foes such as Brazil
  and South Africa. The document was published after months of delay amid
  reports of internal dissent at the state department over its contents. In case
  you missed our news story on the topic: Police forces should consider
  disclosing the ethnicity and migration status of suspects when they are
  charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations, according to new
  official guidance. After a row over claims that police “covered up” the
  backgrounds of two men charged in connection with the alleged rape of a child,
  the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing have
  backed plans to release details of nationality when there is a “policing
  purpose” for doing so. This could be to reduce the risk to public safety,
  “where there are high levels of mis- or disinformation about a particular
  incident”, or in cases of significant public interest, senior police said. The
  decision to release new guidance has been praised by a former senior
  prosecutor, who said it could help counter rumours and disinformation which
  spread on social media. But it will also anger some anti-racist campaigners,
  who have expressed concern that such proposals could risk framing violence
  against women and girls as an issue of ethnicity instead of misogyny. The
  decision comes after Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, urged police to
  release the details of ethnicity last week. Forces are already encouraged to
  publicise charging decisions in serious cases, the NPCC said. Decisions on
  whether to release this information will remain with forces, an NPCC statement
  said, with wider legal and ethical considerations. The Home Office will decide
  if it is “appropriate in all the circumstances” to confirm immigration status
  of a suspect, the guidance said. Facial recognition will be used “in a very
  measured, proportionate way”, the policing minister has vowed. Asked about
  allegations a wider rollout of facial recognition was the “thin end of the
  wedge”, leading to a “total surveillance society”, Diana Johnson told BBC
  Breakfast: With the greatest of respect, that’s not what this is about. This
  is about giving the tools to our police officers to enable them to keep us
  safe. And the live facial recognition results in London, where it’s been used,
  in the past 12 months, over 580 arrests were made, and these included people
  who were wanted for rape, for GBH (grievous bodily harm), for robbery, for
  domestic abuse, and also for sex offenders who were breaching their conditions
  of being out in the community. So I think this is a really powerful tool for
  policing. And it’s actually a tool, it’s not an automated decision maker. So,
  the police officer has to look at what’s being put up on the screen and decide
  what to do next, so there’s that human involvement, but it is a really
  powerful tool, which I think the public would actually be supportive of being
  used in a very measured, proportionate way to go after those individuals that
  the police are looking for for these serious offences. Disinformation could
  still spread around suspects arrested under new guidance for police, a
  minister has said, reports the PA news agency. Police forces have been told to
  share suspects’ ethnicity and nationality with the public after authorities
  were accused of covering up offences carried out by asylum seekers, and after
  riots following the Southport murders which were partly fuelled by social
  media disinformation. The interim guidance by the National Police Chiefs’
  Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing comes after mounting pressure on
  police over the details they make public. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether not
  revealing nationality and ethnicity until a suspect is charged, rather than
  when they are arrested, means disinformation could still spread in the
  community as it did after Axel Rudakubana’s murders in Southport, policing
  minister Diana Johnson agreed. Johnson said: (Disinformation) is a bigger
  problem for society, I think, but in terms of particular individuals, what
  normally happens is at charge, information is released. That’s what’s happened
  before. Johnson said: We were very supportive of being as open and as
  transparent as possible and this interim guidance will set out that on charge,
  usually name and addresses are given. We also, in most cases, will want to see
  nationality or ethnicity given as well. This goes back to last year and what
  happened, that appalling atrocity in Southport. She said the government has
  asked the Law Commission to look into the guidance to make sure any future
  trial is not prejudiced by information released. Asked if information about a
  suspect’s asylum status will be shared in new guidance, Johnson replied: To
  date, it’s not something that the Home Office comment on in terms of asylum
  applications that are made by individuals. More on this story in a moment.
  Also today, Keir Starmer will co-chair a meeting with pro-Ukraine allies after
  a call with US president Donald Trump and European leaders about ending the
  war scheduled to take place at about midday. According to The Times, US
  vice-president JD Vance will meet Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for breakfast
  in the Cotswolds. In the afternoon, JD Vance is scheduled to visit US troops
  at Royal Air Force Fairford in Gloucestershire. In other developments: A Trump
  administration report has accused the UK of backsliding on human rights over
  the past year, citing increased antisemitic violence and growing restrictions
  on free speech. The annual US state department assessment, which analyses
  human rights conditions worldwide, flagged what it described as “serious
  restrictions” on freedom of expression in the UK. A former cabinet minister
  has said the UK government is “digging itself into a hole” over Palestine
  Action and fellow Labour peers and MPs were regretting voting to ban the
  group. The warning by Peter Hain, who opposed proscription, came as a Labour
  backbencher who supported it said the issue would arise again when parliament
  returned in September. Scottish Green Party members will begin voting for the
  party’s new leadership from Wednesday. The ballot to replace the current team
  of co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will be open until 22 August,
  with the results to be published a week later. More than 46,000 public bodies
  spurned the offer of a free King Charles portrait. According to a Guardian
  exclusive, the Cabinet Office has refused a freedom of information (FoI)
  request to disclose exactly where the pictures did end up amid falling public
  support for monarchy. A group of nine human rights and freedom of expression
  organisations have called on the culture secretary to halt RedBird Capital’s
  proposed £500m takeover of the Telegraph and investigate the US private equity
  company’s ties to China. The international non-governmental organisations,
  which include Index on Censorship, Reporters Without Borders and Article 19,
  have written to Lisa Nandy arguing that RedBird Capital’s links with China
  “threaten media pluralism, transparency and information integrity in the UK”.

That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the UK politics live blog for today. Thank you for following along. The blog will be back tomorrow at the usual time but, for now, stay informed of all the latest UK politics news here. Goodnight. David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog because he did not have a rod licence to go fishing with JD Vance. The foreign secretary failed to catch any fish when he hosted the US vice-president at his grace-and-favour retreat at Chevening House, Kent. Anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod licence to fish for freshwater species, such as carp, according to the Environment Agency. Donald Trump’s interventions over the Ukraine war have created a “viable” chance of a ceasefire but the UK stands ready to “increase pressure” on Russia if necessary, Keir Starmer has said. In a call with allies on Wednesday, the prime minister said the meeting between the US president and Russian leader Vladimir Putin is “hugely important” with the prospect of a truce in sight, PA reported. Keir Starmer has said that plans have already been formed to deploy a “reassurance force” once a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia has been agreed. The prime minister said the UK was also drawing up further sanctions on Russia as part of an attempt to squeeze Vladimir Putin. The next mass protest in support of the banned group Palestine Action will aim to be twice the size of the last, organisers have said, as they increase pressure on the government to lift its proscription. Last Saturday’s protest in Parliament Square was predicated on 500 people signing up but the next one, announced on Wednesday for 6 September, is conditional on 1,000 people agreeing to take part. Keir Starmer is to formally revive Northern Powerhouse rail this autumn with an announcement expected before the Labour conference, as a major demonstration of Labour’s commitment to northern infrastructure. Sources said the speech would be delivered by both Starmer and Rachel Reeves as they attempt to show their commitment to Labour’s former heartlands across the north of England, where Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is eyeing significant gains at the next general election. Prime minister Keir Starmer has paid tribute to Welsh Labour politician Hefin David, describing him as a “powerful voice for the people of Wales and a committed public servant”. Backbench politician David died suddenly, the first minister of Wales confirmed on Wednesday shortly before midday. Eluned Morgan, the Welsh Labour leader, paid tribute to the Caerphilly MS, who has been a member of the Welsh parliament since 2016. The Treasury is looking at ways to increase the money it collects through inheritance tax (IHT), sources have told the Guardian. Ideas on the table include a review of the rules on giving away assets, with one possibility being the introduction of a lifetime cap on how much an individual can donate. Yvette Cooper insisted there would be “safeguards and protections” governing the use of live facial recognition as she was questioned about whether its deployment could infringe on privacy. The vitriol faced by scouts and charity rowers mistaken for migrants was not an “innocent mistake”, a race equality campaigner has said, as she warned that toxic rhetoric could lead to more vigilantism and violence. A wave of anti-migrant protests outside asylum hotels in recent weeks has been followed by growing reports of vigilantism, with people facing abuse after being mistaken for migrants. Scotland would have a stronger economy and would be richer if the UK government allowed greater immigration and rejoined the EU, Shona Robison, the Scottish finance secretary said after the country’s fiscal deficit grew. Robison said the growing deficit, which reached £26.5bn or 11.4% of Scotland’s GDP in 2024/25, was partly attributable to the economic damage caused by Brexit and the impacts of strict immigration controls on Scotland’s population. The Scottish Greens have to broaden their appeal beyond middle-class urbanites by talking to voters in industrial towns facing wholesale job losses, a Green leadership candidate has said. Gillian Mackay is one of four Scottish Greens bidding to win two co-leader posts after Patrick Harvie, the UK’s longest-serving party leader, quit as co-convener earlier this year. A group of nine human rights and freedom of expression organisations have called on the culture secretary to halt RedBird Capital’s proposed £500m takeover of the Telegraph and investigate the US private equity company’s ties to China. The international non-governmental organisations, which include Index on Censorship, Reporters Without Borders and Article 19, have written to Lisa Nandy arguing that RedBird Capital’s links with China “threaten media pluralism, transparency and information integrity in the UK”. A Chinese firm is reportedly a leading contender to buy Thames Water if the heavily indebted company collapses in coming weeks. Hong Kong’s CKI, which invests in power and other utility companies in the UK, is among those lining up to acquire the water and sewerage supplier if it enters a special administration regime (SAR), according to the Times. The Trump administration has accused the UK of backsliding on human rights over the past year, citing antisemitic violence and “serious restrictions” on free speech. The annual US state department assessment, which analyses human rights conditions worldwide, highlighted laws limiting speech around abortion clinics, as well as the way government officials “repeatedly intervened to chill speech” online after the 2024 Southport attack. Disinformation could still spread around suspects arrested under new guidance for police, a minister has said, reports the PA news agency. Police forces have been told to share suspects’ ethnicity and nationality with the public after authorities were accused of covering up offences carried out by asylum seekers, and after riots following the Southport murders which were partly fuelled by social media disinformation. The Scottish Greens have to broaden their appeal beyond middle-class urbanites by talking to voters in industrial towns facing wholesale job losses, a Green leadership candidate has said. Gillian Mackay is one of four Scottish Greens bidding to win two co-leader posts after Patrick Harvie, the UK’s longest-serving party leader, quit as co-convener earlier this year. The pro-independence Scottish Greens are currently Holyrood’s fourth largest party, with seven MSPs, and could play a key role in the devolved parliament after next year’s elections. The Greens prop up the Scottish National party government in Edinburgh, which does not have a majority at Holyrood and is expected to form a minority administration again next year. Recent polls place the Greens as high as 15%, suggesting they could win several more seats. Mackay said her area around Falkirk had been devastated by industrial decline, including the closure of Grangemouth oil refinery earlier this year, yet the Scottish Greens historically had failed to connect with local voters. The Scottish and UK governments knew Grangemouth would close, affecting several thousand jobs in the region, but had failed to put in place an industrial strategy to guarantee green jobs, she said. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer has said that plans have already been formed to deploy a “reassurance force” once a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia has been agreed. The prime minister said the UK was also drawing up further sanctions on Russia as part of an attempt to squeeze Vladimir Putin. He said: “We’ve made some real progress today. A very important call with president Trump earlier on in relation to security guarantees, as Emmanuel [Macron] has just set out. As we’ve said all along, we the coalition, stepping up, showing what we will do, but plans we’ve put forward, credible military plans alongside that with the backing of the US. We stand ready as a coalition to support the meeting on Friday and everything I hope can flow out of it.” He added: “We’re ready to support this, including through the plans that we’ve already drawn up to deploy a reassurance force once hostilities have ceased. It is important to remind colleagues that we do stand ready also to increase pressure on Russia, particularly the economy, with sanctions and wider measures as necessary. “You can see the effect of those measures already, and we in the UK are preparing our next packages of strong sanctions in that regard.” US vice-president JD Vance has said the UK and the US “make it easier to achieve peace and prosperity all over the world”. In a speech to American troops stationed in the UK, he said: “If you look at the long sweep of history, every time something big happens for the world, every time a great victory is won for freedom and for peace and for prosperity, it is almost always the Brits and the Americans that do it together, and we win every single time we go to war together. You guys know that as well as anybody. “But it’s not just about going to war, and it’s not just winning when we do. “When we work together, when we fight together, when we make it clear that we always approach every situation with an open hand - but if things go poorly, we’re willing to do what we have to do - we make it easier to achieve peace and prosperity all over the world.” Donald Trump’s interventions over the Ukraine war have created a “viable” chance of a ceasefire but the UK stands ready to “increase pressure” on Russia if necessary, Keir Starmer has said. In a call with allies on Wednesday, the prime minister said the meeting between the US president and Russian leader Vladimir Putin is “hugely important” with the prospect of a truce in sight, PA reported. Co-chairing a meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” - a European-led effort to prepare a peacekeeping force to monitor any potential ceasefire in Ukraine - Starmer said: “This meeting on Friday that president Trump is attending is hugely important. “As I’ve said firstly to president Trump for the three-and-a-bit years this conflict has been going on, we haven’t got anywhere near a prospect of actually a viable solution, a viable way of bringing it to a ceasefire. “And now we have that chance, because of the work of the president.” The UK readout from the European leaders’ call issued by Keir Starmer’s spokesperson stressed the “unwavering” support for Ukraine as the leaders “agreed this week marks an important moment for the future of Ukraine,” and thanked US president Donald Trump “for his efforts in bringing Putin to the table in pursuit of a ceasefire to end to the ongoing bloodshed.” The statement added: “The prime minister was clear that our support for Ukraine is unwavering – international borders must not be changed by force and Ukraine must have robust and credible security guarantees to defend its territorial integrity as part of any deal. “Europe stands ready to support this and will continue to work alongside president Trump and President Zelenskyy for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine …” It noted that the leaders would speak again after Friday. Britain’s data protection watchdog has warned facial recognition does not operate in a “legal vacuum” and police must use it with “appropriate safeguards”, as it prepares to share findings from an audit of two Welsh forces. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) does not operate in a legal vacuum. “It is covered by data protection law, which requires any use of personal data, including biometric data, to be lawful, fair and proportionate. “When used by the police, FRT must be deployed in a way that respects people’s rights and freedoms, with appropriate safeguards in place. “FRT is a priority for the ICO due to its potential benefits and risks. “We play an important role ensuring police are compliant with data protection law and that people’s rights are protected, including by providing clear guidance on the use of FRT and undertaking regular audits of police forces, so that the public can have confidence in how the technology is used. “We have recently concluded our audit of South Wales Police and Gwent Police and will be sharing our findings shortly.” The next mass protest in support of the banned group Palestine Action will aim to be twice the size of the last, organisers have said, as they increase pressure on the government to lift its proscription. Last Saturday’s protest in Parliament Square was predicated on 500 people signing up but the next one, announced on Wednesday for 6 September, is conditional on 1,000 people agreeing to take part. Defend Our Juries, the pressure group behind the protests opposing the proscription of Palestine Action, said it believed a turnout of 1,000 would be enough to get the ban lifted. A total of 532 people were arrested at Saturday’s demonstration, all but 10 under section 13 of the Terrorism Act for carrying placards saying: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.” The number of people arrested for peaceful protests, their age profile – half of those arrested were 60 or older – and the strain it is putting on the criminal justice system have led many to question the ban. A Defend Our Juries spokesperson said: With all the real challenges facing the country, it’s crazy that the Labour government has generated a political crisis over people quietly holding cardboard signs against genocide in Parliament Square. This won’t be forgotten. The vitriol faced by scouts and charity rowers mistaken for migrants was not an “innocent mistake”, a race equality campaigner has said, as she warned that toxic rhetoric could lead to more vigilantism and violence. A wave of anti-migrant protests outside asylum hotels in recent weeks has been followed by growing reports of vigilantism, with people facing abuse after being mistaken for migrants. Police have launched an investigation into an incident at a scout camp in Wales, where children were allegedly filmed and subjected to racial abuse amid unfounded speculation the site was being used to house immigrants. Last week, Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe – formerly of Reform UK, now an independent – was accused of being part of a vigilante effort after he reported a charity rowing crew he mistakenly thought were possible “illegal migrants”. “We’re in a really dangerous situation and the government really needs to step up to the challenge,” said Dr Shabna Begum, the chief executive of the Runnymede Trust. We’re in quite a desperate place of despair and gloom, and that breeds the division and type of activity that we’re seeing. We are looking at a really bleak future where, if the government doesn’t address some of the deep-seated inequalities in the country, we are likely to see more of these vigilante groups, which just breed more violence. Reports of a vigilante group in Bournemouth have been met with alarm. More than 200 residents have supposedly signed up to Safeguard Force, which claims it will carry out uniformed patrols in the seaside town to protect “women, children and the elderly”. Begum said this type of behaviour had been triggered by a “breakdown of the social contract” and a failure of politicians to deal with economic deprivation. Keir Starmer has spoken with his Dutch counterpart Dick Schoof and agreed “there should be no decisions about the future of Ukraine without Ukraine” in a call on Wednesday, Downing Street said. A Number 10 spokesperson said: The prime minister spoke to the prime minister of the Netherlands Dick Schoof earlier today. They discussed their sustained support for Ukraine and the ongoing work to end Russia’s barbaric war. They agreed that there should be no decisions about the future of Ukraine without Ukraine. They looked forward to discussing further in this afternoon’s meetings alongside President Trump and President Zelensky. It was a celebratory multimillion pound scheme to mark the beginning of King Charles III’s reign. Free portraits of the king were offered to all public bodies – every town hall, university, hospital and even jobcentre – so the new monarch’s visage could gaze down on his subjects. The initiative would provide “a reminder of the example set by our ultimate public servant”, said the then Tory deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden. But the current government is proving coy about where exactly any of the images of King Charles ended up after it admitted more than 46,000 public institutions had showed no interest. In what has been described as an “absurd” decision about a scheme to distribute large portraits of the king to be hung in public view, it is refusing to say which schools, hospitals and job centres did request them, saying it could “give rise to controversy” and create “negative public perception”. More than £2.7m was spent meeting requests for the pictures and while take-up was patchy, more than 20,000 images of Charles in a medal-laden Royal Navy uniform were sent out – a 31% hit rate. But the reluctance to reveal where they ended up has emerged from a Guardian freedom of information request which the Cabinet Office has been resisting for many months. Last October it rejected the request for the information by arguing disclosure would be an “actionable breach of confidence”. In effect it implied a public authority which requested a portrait of the king to display in public might sue the government for revealing that it had done so. When the Guardian appealed on the grounds that “requesting a portrait of the king funded by the taxpayer for the express purpose of being publicly displayed cannot reasonably be considered a confidential matter”, it dropped that justification and changed tack to claim release would “prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs”, a different exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. It said disclosure “would be likely to trigger questions about why certain organisations requested the portrait and (by extension) why others did not” and that organisations would be distracted from operational activity by having to answer them. The Treasury is looking at ways to increase the money it collects through inheritance tax (IHT), sources have told the Guardian. Ideas on the table include a review of the rules on giving away assets, with one possibility being the introduction of a lifetime cap on how much an individual can donate. Any changes would come on top of other moves the government has already made to close IHT loopholes. The Guardian’s money and consumer editor, Hilary Osborne, has written this explainer on how IHT works and what might be changing: Keir Starmer is to formally revive Northern Powerhouse rail this autumn with an announcement expected before the Labour conference, as a major demonstration of Labour’s commitment to northern infrastructure. Sources said the speech would be delivered by both Starmer and Rachel Reeves as they attempt to show their commitment to Labour’s former heartlands across the north of England, where Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is eyeing significant gains at the next general election. Government advisers are planning to time the announcement before Labour conference on 28 September, with the aim of boosting the morale of backbenchers after a series of damaging U-turns. The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, is expected to make the rail project a key theme of her conference speech. A government source said the announcement was likely to take place before then but that the timing was not yet confirmed. Political and industry figures in the north of England have urged Starmer for over a year to revive the Manchester leg of HS2 and to build Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR), an east-west connection linking Liverpool to Hull. NPR is seen by some as critical to rebalancing the UK’s economy as it would connect potentially five of Britain’s major cities – including Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield – on a route that for decades has been choked by trundling old trains and the overloaded M62. A DfT source said the exact route had not yet been formally agreed. The NPR plan requires part of the HS2 construction between Crewe and Manchester to go ahead, also raising hopes that ministers would also commit to some form of HS2 running to Birmingham and London. David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog because he did not have a rod licence to go fishing with JD Vance. The foreign secretary failed to catch any fish when he hosted the US vice-president at his grace-and-favour retreat at Chevening House, Kent. Anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or over must have a rod licence to fish for freshwater species, such as carp, according to the Environment Agency. “The foreign secretary has written to the Environment Agency over an administrative oversight that meant the appropriate licences had not been acquired for fishing on a private lake as part of a diplomatic engagement at Chevening House last week,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said. “As soon as the foreign secretary was made aware of the administrative error, he successfully purchased the relevant rod fishing licences. “He also wrote to the Environment Agency notifying them of the error, demonstrating how it would be rectified, and thanking them for their work protecting Britain’s fisheries.” Scotland would have a stronger economy and would be richer if the UK government allowed greater immigration and rejoined the EU, Shona Robison, the Scottish finance secretary said after the country’s fiscal deficit grew. Robison said the growing deficit, which reached £26.5bn or 11.4% of Scotland’s GDP in 2024/25, was partly attributable to the economic damage caused by Brexit and the impacts of strict immigration controls on Scotland’s population. Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh after the new economic data was published, Robison said: The UK government’s current approach to the economy does not benefit Scotland. Its approach to immigration, for example, harms Scotland by failing to address our demographic and economic needs, and it’s failing to deliver the investment needed, with our capital budget set to fall in real terms over the coming years. And that’s before we go into the effects of Brexit, which is estimated to have reduced our revenue by £2.3 billion. Both those policies would be reversed if Scotland were independent, Robison said. She claimed the positive effects of independence would kick in on “day one”. It would, however, take some years for Scotland to rejoin the EU, and to unpick all Scotland’s complex links with the UK. Most economists, including those used previously by the Scottish National party government, predict an independent government would need to make swingeing spending cuts or significantly raise taxes in order to close the fiscal gap. The new government expenditure and revenue Scotland (GERS) report for 2024/25 said that overall, the UK and Scottish governments raised £91.4bn in taxes in Scotland but spent £117.6bn – a figure which includes Scotland’s notional share of spending in other parts of the UK or overseas in areas such as defence, trade and foreign affairs. Robison also acknowledged Scotland had to rely much less on North Sea oil and gas revenues, which were rapidly dwindling, if it became independent. GERS said that excluding oil revenues in 2024/25, Scotland’s notional fiscal deficit rose to £30.6bn, or 14.45 of GDP – far higher than the EU would accept if Scotland tried to become a member. The former judge leading the public inquiry into the death of a black man in custody has refused to step down after the Scottish Police Federation and Scotland’s solicitor general accused him of bias. Responding to Lord Bracadale’s decision to remain in post, the lawyer for the family of Sheku Bayoh, who died in Kirkcaldy in 2015 after he was forcibly restrained by officers, in turn accused the federation of “a deliberate and cynical attempt to evade scrutiny”. Aamer Anwar, who has represented the Bayoh family for a decade, also said that the position of Ruth Charteris, the solicitor general who made the unprecedented intervention, was “untenable”. Charteris and the federation had argued that Bracadale unfairly held private meetings with the Bayoh family, which indicated “apparent bias”, a claim that would have significant ramifications for other UK public inquiries if it had been accepted. But, after a hearing that cost the taxpayer £2m, he concluded that the meetings were “private but not secret” and did not breach the right of other participants in the inquiry to be heard. Prime minister Keir Starmer has paid tribute to Welsh Labour politician Hefin David, describing him as a “powerful voice for the people of Wales and a committed public servant”. Backbench politician David died suddenly, the first minister of Wales confirmed on Wednesday shortly before midday. Eluned Morgan, the Welsh Labour leader, paid tribute to the Caerphilly MS, who has been a member of the Welsh parliament since 2016. In a statement after David’s death, Starmer said: The entire Labour movement will join me in grieving the loss of Hefin David. He was a powerful voice for the people of Wales and a committed public servant, who dedicated his life to making sure every person and community in Wales had the opportunities and support they deserve. As Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly, where he was born and lived, he was incredibly proud of his community. Our hearts are with his family and those who knew and loved him at this painful time. May he rest in peace. According to the PA news agency, a Gwent police spokesperson said: We were called to a report of a medical emergency at an address in Nelson at around 6.55pm on Tuesday August 12. Officers attended and after entering the property found a 47-year-old man unresponsive inside. Paramedics from the Welsh ambulance service also attended and confirmed that the man had died; his family are aware and receiving support. The death is not viewed as suspicious, and a report will be submitted to the coroner in relation to the death. Keir Starmer will be among European leaders who will speak with the US president, Donald Trump, and his vice-president, JD Vance, today, consulting ahead of this Friday’s summit with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Representing Team Europe are the host, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, and Starmer. They will be joined by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, António Costa, and that famous Trump-whisperer, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte. They will be also joined by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who in a further show of unity with his partners will not only be on the call, but will be joining the host in person in Berlin. You can follow Jakub Krupa’s updates on this in the Guardian’s Europe live blog: Yvette Cooper insisted there would be “safeguards and protections” governing the use of live facial recognition as she was questioned about whether its deployment could infringe on privacy. The PA news agency reports that when Cooper was asked whether the rollout was an infringement on people’s privacy, the home secretary said: Well, the way this technology is being used is to identify people who are wanted by the court, who maybe should be returned to prison, or who have failed to appear before the court, or who have breached things like sexual harm prevention orders, so serious criminals. And I think being able to identify them, alongside having proper legal safeguards and a legal framework in place because there do have to be safeguards and protections, but we also need to be able to use the technology to catch dangerous criminals and to keep communities safe. The home secretary has welcomed guidance for the police that has told them to share suspects’ ethnicity and nationality with the public, reports the PA news agency. Yvette Cooper said the government had been clearer for the need for more openness. It comes after authorities were accused of covering up offences carried out by asylum seekers, and in the wake of riots after the Southport murders which were partly fuelled by social media disinformation. Cooper said: We welcome the guidance because this is a step forward, and we have been clear that we need greater transparency and that’s what the public want to see. But we have also asked the Law Commission, particularly to look at what information can be released to make sure that we’re not also affecting criminal trials that are under way. That’s where a lot of the restrictions and constraints have been. So we’ve asked the Law Commission to report, very quickly, this autumn on what more can be done to avoid prejudicing criminal trials. A group of nine human rights and freedom of expression organisations have called on the culture secretary to halt RedBird Capital’s proposed £500m takeover of the Telegraph and investigate the US private equity company’s ties to China. The international non-governmental organisations, which include Index on Censorship, Reporters Without Borders and Article 19, have written to Lisa Nandy arguing that RedBird Capital’s links with China “threaten media pluralism, transparency and information integrity in the UK”. A consortium led by RedBird Capital agreed a deal in May to buy the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, ending two years of uncertainty over the future of the titles. The organisations said that RedBird Capital’s chair, John Thornton, sits on the advisory council of the China Investment Corporation, the country’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Thornton, a former chair of Goldman Sachs Asia, has also previously chaired the Silk Road Finance Corporation. “Both [are] vehicles through which China has pursued financial influence,” the letter said. The signatories, who also include Hong Kong Watch, Human Rights in China and the Hong Kong Democracy Council, said Nandy should follow her predecessor, Lucy Frazer, who issued a public interest intervention notice (PIIN) in January last year. Former Holyrood presiding officer George Reid has died at the age of 86, his family have announced. He died in the early hours of Tuesday at Strathcarron Hospice near Denny, just a few miles from where he was born in Clackmannanshire, reports the PA news agency. Flags at the Scottish parliament he helped to complete have been lowered as a mark of respect, current presiding officer Alison Johnstone announced. First minister John Swinney led tributes to Reid, crediting him as being one of the voices that brought him into politics as a teenager. “I am desperately saddened by the loss of the remarkable George Reid,” the first minister said in a statement on Wednesday. He added: His passion for Scotland, his principled internationalist worldview, and his empathy for the plight of people everywhere made him a voice that could not be ignored across five decades. As an MP, he was a trailblazing member of the SNP’s breakthrough victories of 1974. He became, for me, one of the compelling voices of the campaign for a Scottish parliament in 1979. His was one of the voices that brought me into politics and kindled my belief in independence that has driven my adult life. I feel so privileged to have been shaped by his influence and inspiration. George was a founding member of the Scottish parliament. More than that, after Holyrood’s difficult early years, he put aside party and provided emphatic national leadership as the presiding officer, ending the controversies over the new building and cementing the institution’s place in modern political life. Throughout it all, his articulation of the case for Scotland deciding her own future was as compelling to me when I sat with him in his home just four short weeks ago, as it was when I was a teenager. A Chinese firm is reportedly a leading contender to buy Thames Water if the heavily indebted company collapses in coming weeks. Hong Kong’s CKI, which invests in power and other utility companies in the UK, is among those lining up to acquire the water and sewerage supplier if it enters a special administration regime (SAR), according to the Times. It has reportedly said it would be prepared to operate under tougher penalties for environmental breaches than Thames’s class A creditors, who have put together their own purchase bid. The creditor group has said the company cannot afford to operate with an expected £1bn of fines coming down the track, which are levied by the regulator for breaches such as illegally dumping sewage. In May, Thames was hit with a record £104m fine over environmental breaches involving sewage spills. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, has in recent months stepped up preparations for the possibility of putting Thames into SAR – effectively a form of temporary nationalisation. On Tuesday the government confirmed it had appointed FTI Consulting to make contingency plans for a potential collapse. The appointment indicates that FTI is the first choice to act as administrator if the government enacted an SAR, although a court would ultimately approve such a step. Thames, which supplies 16 million customers in London and south-east England, has been racing to pull together a deal to avoid financial collapse. The government has been trying to avoid such an outcome, with the Treasury threatening that a potential £4bn bill from the SAR could be forced on to Reed’s department. This process would ensure that the taps stayed on for customers but would heap immediate costs on to the government. However, the government’s Water (Special Measures) Act contains a provision for SAR costs to be recouped from customer bills further down the line. Responding to reports that Nigel Farage would be meeting US vice-president JD Vance today, leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said last night: Nigel Farage could use his meeting with JD Vance to tell the White House that in Europe we stand together against Putin’s aggression. But Farage won’t do that because he’s much more interested in pleasing Trump than in standing up for British values and European security. Nasar Meer, a professor of social and political sciences at the University of Glasgow, has written an opinion piece for the Guardian today on the topic of routinely disclosing the ethnicity of police suspects. Supporters say more “transparency” will prevent malign forces from flourishing – but the argument is profoundly flawed, he writes: In an interview this morning, the policing minister, Diana Johnson, said she had seen facial recognition technology in action in Croydon, London, where the Metropolitan police had put together a watchlist of wanted individuals, and the list was deleted after the exercise. “So it was very tailored,” Johnson told BBC Breakfast. She added: There are laws about how this has to be done in terms of human rights, equalities law, data protection laws. I think one of the concerns people, perhaps rightly, have is the need to consolidate that into one piece of legislation or one law, and that’s something we’re going to consult on later in the year, about how live facial recognition technology should be used and the oversight of it to make it as transparent as possible for the public to really feel this is something that the police are using properly. Johnson had earlier told Times Radio: There is quite a lot of misinformation out there about what this actually does and how it’s used. She said: And I know in the past, there’ve been concerns about bias, particularly around certain ethnic groups or genders or age. And the way that this is now structured, the algorithms that are being used have been independently tested, so I’m confident that the live facial recognition that we’re rolling out today actually is within the law and does not have the bias that has happened previously. According to the Home Office, the technology will be used to track down high-harm offenders. Seven English forces will have access to 10 vans equipped with cameras, across Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and Hampshire, following on from recent deployments by London’s Met police and South Wales police, reports the PA news agency. Ch Supt Tim Morgan of South Wales police said the technology had “never resulted in a wrongful arrest in south Wales, and there have been no false alerts for several years as the technology and our understanding has evolved”. But human rights campaigners have “concerns” about “this incredibly intrusive technology”, Shami Chakrabarti, a former director of the civil liberties advocacy group Liberty, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The former shadow attorney general said: Some would say this is yet another move towards a total surveillance society – challenges to privacy, challenges to freedom of assembly and association, and problems with race and sex discrimination because of the higher likelihood of false matches in the context of certain groups. She said that “the public generally understand that police powers are governed by statute, so there’s a public conversation, there are parliamentary debates and votes”, but warned there was no law specifically covering live facial recognition to gather evidence. “It’s particularly odd that this has all been developed pretty much completely outside the law,” she said. Chakrabarti said she “welcomed” plans to consult ahead of possible new legislation, but warned that to date, “it’s been a bit of a wild west – the police procuring technology from whichever companies they see fit, the police drawing up watchlists of who they’re looking for and what level, what severity of crime should be sufficient for deployment, and pretty much marking their own homework”. The gap between public spending and taxes in Scotland has grown sharply to more than £26bn, leaving it with a deficit twice as large as the UK’s, official data shows. The latest annual report on Scottish expenditure and tax revenues shows the notional fiscal deficit – the gap between overall spending and overall tax receipts – stood at 11.7% of Scottish GDP in the last financial year. The UK’s deficit was 5.1% for 2024/25, and the revenue gap has grown in Scotland. In the previous year, it stood at 9.7% of GDP. Those figures, which include all types of spending and tax raising by both the Scottish and UK governments, include Scotland’s notional share of revenues from North Sea oil and gas. Those fell last year, contributing to the increasing fiscal gap. Overall, the two governments raised £91.4bn in taxes but spent £117.6bn – a figure which includes Scotland’s notional share of spending in other parts of the UK or overseas in areas such as defence, trade and foreign affairs. The Scottish government said these annual accounts, part of the Government expenditure and revenue Scotland (GERS) series, showed that domestic tax receipts grew faster than all devolved government spending and social security spending for the fourth year running. The data has continuing significance because the Scottish National party government in Edinburgh plans to make independence part of next year’s devolved elections again. Scotland’s ability to finance its spending independently is a crucial issue in that debate. Shona Robison, the Scottish finance secretary, said: The decisions we have taken here in Scotland are helping support sustainable public finances. Scotland’s public finances are better than many other parts of the UK, with the third highest revenue per person in the UK, behind only London and the south-east. Ian Murray, the secretary of state for Scotland, who represents the UK government, said: These figures underline the collective economic strength of the United Kingdom and how Scotland benefits from the redistribution of wealth inside the UK. By sharing resources with each other across the UK, Scots benefit by £2,669 more per head in public spending than the UK average. It also means that devolved governments have the financial heft of the wider UK behind them when taking decisions. The Trump administration has accused the UK of backsliding on human rights over the past year, citing antisemitic violence and “serious restrictions” on free speech. The annual US state department assessment, which analyses human rights conditions worldwide, highlighted laws limiting speech around abortion clinics, as well as the way government officials “repeatedly intervened to chill speech” online after the 2024 Southport attack. The report stated: The government sometimes took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, but prosecution and punishment for such abuses was inconsistent. The report cited the “safe access zones” around abortion clinics, which it said “could include prohibitions on efforts to influence … even through prayer or silent protests”. Criticism over the handling of free speech – in particular relating to regulations on online hate speech – was also directed at the governments of Germany and France. A UK government spokesperson said: Free speech is vital for democracy around the world, including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe. The document, previously seen as the most comprehensive study of its kind, has been significantly rewritten and downscaled by the Trump administration, including in areas such as government corruption and LGBTQ+ rights. It spares criticism for US allies such as Israel and El Salvador while escalating disapproval of perceived foes such as Brazil and South Africa. The document was published after months of delay amid reports of internal dissent at the state department over its contents. In case you missed our news story on the topic: Police forces should consider disclosing the ethnicity and migration status of suspects when they are charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations, according to new official guidance. After a row over claims that police “covered up” the backgrounds of two men charged in connection with the alleged rape of a child, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing have backed plans to release details of nationality when there is a “policing purpose” for doing so. This could be to reduce the risk to public safety, “where there are high levels of mis- or disinformation about a particular incident”, or in cases of significant public interest, senior police said. The decision to release new guidance has been praised by a former senior prosecutor, who said it could help counter rumours and disinformation which spread on social media. But it will also anger some anti-racist campaigners, who have expressed concern that such proposals could risk framing violence against women and girls as an issue of ethnicity instead of misogyny. The decision comes after Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, urged police to release the details of ethnicity last week. Forces are already encouraged to publicise charging decisions in serious cases, the NPCC said. Decisions on whether to release this information will remain with forces, an NPCC statement said, with wider legal and ethical considerations. The Home Office will decide if it is “appropriate in all the circumstances” to confirm immigration status of a suspect, the guidance said. Facial recognition will be used “in a very measured, proportionate way”, the policing minister has vowed. Asked about allegations a wider rollout of facial recognition was the “thin end of the wedge”, leading to a “total surveillance society”, Diana Johnson told BBC Breakfast: With the greatest of respect, that’s not what this is about. This is about giving the tools to our police officers to enable them to keep us safe. And the live facial recognition results in London, where it’s been used, in the past 12 months, over 580 arrests were made, and these included people who were wanted for rape, for GBH (grievous bodily harm), for robbery, for domestic abuse, and also for sex offenders who were breaching their conditions of being out in the community. So I think this is a really powerful tool for policing. And it’s actually a tool, it’s not an automated decision maker. So, the police officer has to look at what’s being put up on the screen and decide what to do next, so there’s that human involvement, but it is a really powerful tool, which I think the public would actually be supportive of being used in a very measured, proportionate way to go after those individuals that the police are looking for for these serious offences. Disinformation could still spread around suspects arrested under new guidance for police, a minister has said, reports the PA news agency. Police forces have been told to share suspects’ ethnicity and nationality with the public after authorities were accused of covering up offences carried out by asylum seekers, and after riots following the Southport murders which were partly fuelled by social media disinformation. The interim guidance by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing comes after mounting pressure on police over the details they make public. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether not revealing nationality and ethnicity until a suspect is charged, rather than when they are arrested, means disinformation could still spread in the community as it did after Axel Rudakubana’s murders in Southport, policing minister Diana Johnson agreed. Johnson said: (Disinformation) is a bigger problem for society, I think, but in terms of particular individuals, what normally happens is at charge, information is released. That’s what’s happened before. Johnson said: We were very supportive of being as open and as transparent as possible and this interim guidance will set out that on charge, usually name and addresses are given. We also, in most cases, will want to see nationality or ethnicity given as well. This goes back to last year and what happened, that appalling atrocity in Southport. She said the government has asked the Law Commission to look into the guidance to make sure any future trial is not prejudiced by information released. Asked if information about a suspect’s asylum status will be shared in new guidance, Johnson replied: To date, it’s not something that the Home Office comment on in terms of asylum applications that are made by individuals. More on this story in a moment. Also today, Keir Starmer will co-chair a meeting with pro-Ukraine allies after a call with US president Donald Trump and European leaders about ending the war scheduled to take place at about midday. According to The Times, US vice-president JD Vance will meet Reform UK leader Nigel Farage for breakfast in the Cotswolds. In the afternoon, JD Vance is scheduled to visit US troops at Royal Air Force Fairford in Gloucestershire. In other developments: A Trump administration report has accused the UK of backsliding on human rights over the past year, citing increased antisemitic violence and growing restrictions on free speech. The annual US state department assessment, which analyses human rights conditions worldwide, flagged what it described as “serious restrictions” on freedom of expression in the UK. A former cabinet minister has said the UK government is “digging itself into a hole” over Palestine Action and fellow Labour peers and MPs were regretting voting to ban the group. The warning by Peter Hain, who opposed proscription, came as a Labour backbencher who supported it said the issue would arise again when parliament returned in September. Scottish Green Party members will begin voting for the party’s new leadership from Wednesday. The ballot to replace the current team of co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will be open until 22 August, with the results to be published a week later. More than 46,000 public bodies spurned the offer of a free King Charles portrait. According to a Guardian exclusive, the Cabinet Office has refused a freedom of information (FoI) request to disclose exactly where the pictures did end up amid falling public support for monarchy. A group of nine human rights and freedom of expression organisations have called on the culture secretary to halt RedBird Capital’s proposed £500m takeover of the Telegraph and investigate the US private equity company’s ties to China. The international non-governmental organisations, which include Index on Censorship, Reporters Without Borders and Article 19, have written to Lisa Nandy arguing that RedBird Capital’s links with China “threaten media pluralism, transparency and information integrity in the UK”.
