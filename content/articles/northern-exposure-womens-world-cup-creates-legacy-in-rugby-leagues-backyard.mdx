  The streets of Eccles have given little away on the face of it over the past
  two Saturdays. Local residents are going about their business, the nearby
  canal path is full of walkers and runners, and there is a slumberous Saturday
  morning feel: until you turn into the Salford Community Stadium. The Women’s
  Rugby World Cup has made a strong start with decent crowds and good viewing
  figures. But there was a concerted effort to go beyond familiar territory in
  this tournament and lay down some roots in the north of England, too. The
  early signs suggest that may well have been achieved. Sunderland, Salford and
  York have all hosted group stage matches; two of those are more used to
  staging professional rugby league games, while Sunderland is hardly a rugby
  territory. But if you have been at any of those stadiums over the past two
  weekends you will have had a sense that rugby union can have some cut-through.
  It is a deliberate move to create inspiring occasions for young girls
  considering taking up rugby. Remember the northern games during the 2010
  Women’s World Cup in England? No? That’s because there weren’t any; every game
  was in the south, the majority at the Surrey Sports Park in Guildford. The
  opening fortnight this year, meanwhile, has reinforced the belief that women’s
  rugby is poised for a major explosion in the north. As that northern leg of
  the tournament wraps up this weekend before the knockouts, it feels like a
  pertinent moment to ponder what sort of legacy will be left behind. In total,
  more than 88,000 supporters have attended the seven games in the three
  northern venues thus far, with York staging a final double-header on Saturday.
  Those numbers are noteworthy, but it is everything around the matches that has
  created a real feeling of excitement. Games at Salford – both league and union
  – can often feel a little bit sombre but the outer area of the stadium was
  converted into a mini-festival with bands, bars, food trucks and opportunities
  to meet and greet the players. It has been a party atmosphere but it has also
  been rugby-centric. Games and skills workshops aimed to engage more youngsters
  with the sport are everywhere you look; who knows, in a few years, one of the
  next big England stars could point to the fact that they were convinced to
  start playing rugby by attending one of these games. Which is exactly the
  point. In a world where sport and entertainment go hand in hand, as shown this
  weekend by the finals of the Hundred, the organisers appear to have bought
  into that mood music. On-field entertainment is great, but if you can give
  your paying match-goers something else to get hooked on, you’re essentially on
  a free ride to success. But where things really get interesting is the
  demographic of those attending. World Rugby insiders believe a significant
  percentage at the northern games have been young women; many with their
  families, others in large groups. They have been bowled over by the take-up
  from the key demographics. Salford is perhaps the most interesting case study
  of the three. There are eight professional rugby league clubs within a 15-mile
  radius of the stadium; many of them have fully functioning Women’s Super
  League clubs including two heavyweights in St Helens and Wigan. In contrast,
  the Sale women’s side was formed in 2020. There is a salient argument that if
  you are a talent in women’s rugby, you have to head south to pursue it. For
  now, at least. The Sharks are doing their own work to boost uptake locally
  through their Girls Tackle Rugby campaign and 33% of the RFU’s funding in its
  Impact 25 programme was distributed to the north of England in the past 12
  months, underlining how areas not traditionally considered rugby heartlands
  are being eyed up as growth opportunities. The one potential downside is that,
  on the whole, the rugby has not always been competitive, save for Australia
  and USA’s thrilling draw in York. But that is where the events mindset comes
  in; with plenty happening around the venues, it is not difficult to imagine
  young girls in the north being inspired to seek out their local rugby club. So
  to York this weekend. The landscape is just as tough to crack there,
  especially when you consider the work that York Valkyrie – arguably the best
  women’s league club in the country – have done for a number of years at
  grassroots level. They invest nearly as much in their women’s programme as
  they do their men’s side. But for World Rugby, the adventure outside the
  familiar strongholds was not just about giving supporters a chance to watch
  live action featuring the world’s best players. The strength of a World Cup on
  home soil is not just in its on-field results, it is the legacy it leaves. We
  will only see the results of that in years to come, but it has been an
  encouraging start. Pool A battle tops final-round bill Seven of eight
  quarter-finalists have already been decided so all eyes turn to Pool A and the
  battle for the one spot left available. That will go to Australia or the USA,
  with the Eagles needing to defeat Samoa, get a favour from England and
  overturn a 135-point deficit to claim second spot. The other three groups
  still have compelling shootouts to decide who finishes top. The most
  intriguing and trickiest to call is New Zealand v Ireland in Pool C on Sunday.
  In Pool D, France and South Africa clash in Northampton with the same fate on
  the line, while the battle to avoid England in the quarter-finals will be
  between Canada and Scotland in Exeter. After a fortnight of one-sided
  scorelines, expect a string of tighter contests this weekend as the best sides
  meet in an exciting hors d’oeuvre for the last eight. Memory lane If you
  needed proof of how far rugby has come, where better to look than the first
  time a World Cup game was staged in the north: the picturesque West Yorkshire
  town of Otley, birthplace of Mike Tindall, all the way back in 1991. Otley
  RFC’s Cross Green played host to Italy’s 30-9 win over the USA in the men’s
  tournament 34 years ago, with 7,500 locals, far bigger than the official
  capacity, flocking to witness it. Still want more? “Phenomenal” was how Jess
  Breach described reaching 50 tries for England in the win against Samoa. Sarah
  Rendell reports. France and South Africa booked their spots in the last eight
  with wins over Brazil and Italy respectively, writes Sarah Rendell. The USA
  and Australia delivered the match of the tournament so far in a scintillating
  31-31 draw in York that kept them both in the hunt for the last eight. Luke
  McLaughlin reports. Portia Woodman-Wickliffe became New Zealand’s all-time
  record try‑scorer as the Black Ferns beat Japan and booked their last-eight
  place. Sarah Rendell was there. Subscribe To subscribe to the Breakdown, just
