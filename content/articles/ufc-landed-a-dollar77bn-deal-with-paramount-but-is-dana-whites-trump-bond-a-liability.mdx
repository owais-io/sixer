  UFC landed a $7.7bn deal with Paramount. But is Dana White’s Trump bond a
  liability?

  Forget for a moment the stereotype that MMA athletes and their fans are
  All-American bar fighters. The MMA community is far more diverse and far more
  cerebral than the casual onlooker realizes. Has Dana White forgotten that? The
  UFC president has long sought to expand the sport’s appeal to as many
  demographics as possible. But in the past few years, he has bet big on a tight
  affiliation with Donald Trump, who has been perfectly content to revel in the
  adulation of one segment of the population while heaping scorn upon all
  others. White has campaigned for Trump, welcomed him to several UFC events and
  hasn’t immediately smacked down the notion of holding a UFC card at the White
  House. On the surface, that might seem logical. MMA culture is intertwined
  with bro culture, and bros are considered the antithesis of “woke” liberalism.
  But it’s not that simple. Consider a startling fact: while Maga champions an
  “America First” ideology, the UFC is a paragon of globalism. Of the 11
  reigning UFC champions, only one is American – Kayla Harrison, thriving in an
  organization White once insisted would exclude women. Both Australia and
  Georgia (the country) boast twice as many champions as the UFC’s home country.
  The only belt firmly held by US fighters is the unofficial ‘BMF’ (Baddest
  Motherfucker) belt. White invented this to reward charismatic fighters who put
  on great shows. While it’s a clever way to encourage personality and panache,
  it also seems like a DEI program to ensure US fighters remain prominent in the
  UFC pantheon. So the UFC roster is more global than ever. But UFC fighters
  have never fit neatly into categories. This diversity was a hallmark of the
  reality show that broke the UFC into the mainstream, The Ultimate Fighter. The
  casts included cerebral chess players, devout Christians and someone who
  brought a compass to ensure that his bed would face north, and another who
  fled the show to reassure his girlfriend that rumors she saw online weren’t
  true. And the UFC evolved in ways that might be considered “progressive.” Cain
  Velasquez didn’t lose any noticeable fan support in 2010 when he sported a
  “Brown Pride” tattoo across his chest and admitted that his father had
  immigrated illegally. (Velasquez has since been sentenced to prison for issues
  unrelated to immigration.) After opposing the idea of female fighters for many
  years, White threw open the octagon door to Ronda Rousey in a 2013 bout
  against Liz Carmouche, who was openly gay. White strongly supported Carmouche
  and even gave an impassioned plea to legalize gay marriage wherever it wasn’t
  already recognized – a position he stated well before a series of landmark US
  supreme court decisions upheld that right. Four years later, UFC fighter
  Jessica Andrade proposed to her girlfriend in her postfight interview in the
  octagon. While the UFC sold Pride Month gear and gave proceeds to an LGBTQIA+
  organization in Nevada, outspoken Trump supporter Colby Covington emerged as
  one of the sport’s biggest villains. Still, the UFC’s primary demographic of
  young adult men proved to be a decisive force for Trump’s return to the
  presidency. This group overlaps significantly with the audience for UFC
  commentator Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, and Rogan – who felt ostracized by
  the left after touting scientifically unsound Covid treatments – endorsed
  Trump last year. But that was November. Fast forward to this summer, and this
  demographic has veered sharply against Trump. Rogan himself has broken with
  the president over tariffs, deportations and the Epstein files. Last month,
  Rogan told podcast guest James Talarico, a Texas Democrat, that he should run
  for the White House. There’s a case to be made that if the Kamala Harris
  campaign had managed to get her on Rogan’s podcast last fall, we would have a
  different president today. Such changes shouldn’t be a surprise. Rogan himself
  is always on the lookout for new ideas – if anything, he’s a little too
  receptive to some schools of thought and doesn’t push back or check facts.
  While older Americans are prone to adopting a party and sticking with it come
  hell or high water, Gen Z is fiercely independent politically. They’re also
  more diverse than previous generations, more likely to be non-white, LGBTQ+ or
  any other group that may feel aggrieved by Trump’s actions since reclaiming
  the presidency. Younger generations are also much more receptive to socialism
  than prior ones – after all, young men made enough of a fuss over Bernie
  Sanders to warrant the term “Bernie Bros.” So Maga’s place in “bro culture” –
  and those who are MMA fans – is by no means secure. And one day, Donald Trump
  will be out of office. We’ve already seen that US conservatives are eager to
  abandon one trend for another. Today’s Maga supporters had a decidedly
  different message when the Tea Party reigned supreme. Two decades after
  calling Democrats “traitors” for opposing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they
  excommunicated the entire Bush family. Trump’s popularity may well be on the
  slide too. His approval rating has tanked, and his mutable responses to the
  Jeffrey Epstein saga have fractured his base. The UFC may well be losing as
  many fans as its attracts by aligning itself with Trump. The UFC, meanwhile,
  is still a strong brand but perhaps not the hot property it was a few years
  ago. Last week’s Disney earnings report made a brief reference to “lower
  Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view fees due to lower average buys per
  event.” The fight game tends to be cyclical, driven by big personalities like
  Rousey, Jon Jones and Conor McGregor, all of whom have either left the sport
  or gone through a prolonged period of inactivity. It’s tough to imagine
  current light heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev reaching the level of fame
  of Forrest Griffin, Rampage Jackson or Chuck Liddell. While we can’t really
  quantify the impact of the Trump lovefest on the UFC’s popularity, the
  organization clearly can’t afford to alienate the 60% or so of the population
  that disapproves of Trump’s presidency thus far. Perhaps this is one reason
  why the UFC has just opted for a new media deal that breaks from their
  pay-per-view model in order to get wider exposure. “This shift in distribution
  strategy will unlock greater accessibility and discoverability for sports
  fans,” said the press release announcing the seven-year, $7.7bn deal. Some
  fight cards will be on network TV, and others will be free to subscribers of
  their streaming partner. That streaming partner, though, is Paramount, which
  has also drawn the ire of many US viewers through a series of moves that
  appear to be a capitulation to the president’s desire to control the media.
  First, Paramount settled a lawsuit over the editing of a Kamala Harris
  interview, a lawsuit deemed by many legal scholars as rather simple for
  Paramount to win, at the same time that the media conglomerate sought
  government approval for a merger. Second, after TV host Stephen Colbert
  criticized his parent company for settling the suit, Paramount announced that
  his show will end in 2026, ostensibly for financial reasons even though it is
  the highest-rated late-night show. (Fox News Channel claims its show Gutfeld!
  has higher ratings, but it airs earlier than the traditional late-night window
  that starts at 11.30pm Eastern time.) Still, the decision to move away from
  the pay-per-view model can only be seen as a sign that the UFC feels the need
  to make its big tent a bit bigger as it faces the difficult challenge of
  keeping US fans interested in a sport in which American athletes are far from
  dominant. Typically, US sports broadcasters gravitate to events in which US
  athletes are faring well, which is why Olympic coverage focuses far more
  attention on swimming and snowboarding than, say, table tennis or biathlon.
  White and Trump were always an odd match. Trump was involved with Affliction,
  a rival MMA organization of the late 2000s that White fought with the venom of
  the Trump administration’s attacks on Harvard and the media. Trump has
  ridiculed veterans, dating back to when he said he didn’t consider John McCain
  a war hero because he likes “people who weren’t captured’ and continuing with
  Ice arrests of veterans in his second term and a recent awkward moment in
  which he turned attention to himself at a ceremony honoring Purple Heart
  recipients; White and the UFC are staunch supporters of the Wounded Warrior
  Project and other veterans’ groups. White is an affable philanthropist; Trump
  used funds from his own foundation on a portrait of himself and his
  presidential campaign. We probably won’t see White publicly repudiate Trump, a
  move that wouldn’t sit well with a sizable portion of UFC’s audience. But over
  the years, White has shrewdly expanded the UFC fanbase, and he would dearly
  love for his sport to be the biggest in the world. White has already
  pronounced that his involvement with politics ends with Trump, telling The New
  Yorker last year that: “I’m never fucking doing this again. I want nothing to
  do with this shit. It’s gross. It’s disgusting. I want nothing to do with
  politics.” White has changed his mind about many things over the years. He
  brought in Kimbo Slice not long after denigrating his fighting skills. He
  brought women into the cage. But those moves were driven by popular uprisings,
  and White is almost always willing to give fans what they want. While much of
  the country watches in horror as Medicaid is slashed, Gaza’s suffering gets
  worse by the week, the economy teeters on the brink, and the White House is in
  crisis mode trying to deflect from the Epstein case, the clamor to make White
  reassert his position at Trump’s side will surely be muted.
