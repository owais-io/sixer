  A new report from the government has found there is “no clinical benefit” to
  having a blood test for Pfas after the so-called “forever chemicals” were
  found in local water supplies in the Blue Mountains. The NSW Health Expert
  Advisory Panel on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas), convened by the
  state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, to provide advice on the
  evidence and guidance related to the potential health effects, published its
  findings in a final report on Tuesday. All recommendations have been accepted
  by NSW Health. The panel included science and health experts in cancer,
  hormone and heart health, epidemiology, pathology, primary care, public health
  and risk communication. They found, based on the substantial research related
  to Pfas already undertaken, “the health effects of Pfas appear to be small”.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email Pfas are a class of manufactured chemicals
  used to make products that resist heat, stains, grease and water – sometimes
  called “forever chemicals” as they are difficult to destroy and can remain in
  soil, groundwater and travel long distances. The report acknowledged that
  studies have reported an association with some health effects, but noted the
  findings are inconsistent across different studies with “limited evidence of a
  dose-response relationship”. The report also found that “while clinical
  testing for Pfas is commercially available, the current scientific evidence
  indicates that there is there is no clinical benefit for an individual to have
  a blood test for Pfas”. The authors stated Pfas blood tests were unlikely to
  guide medical care “because Pfas will be detected in most people, there are
  many different Pfas types and blood levels do not predict any current or
  future health outcomes”. They also warned that Pfas blood test results can
  cause unnecessary concern and subsequent interventions may cause harms. The
  report recommended that “should a health care provider order a blood test for
  Pfas for a patient, the health care provider should provide clear contextual
  information about the test and its limitations to the patient, to manage
  expectations and avoid misinterpretation”. The authors also suggest doctors
  can support patients concerned with their serum PFAS levels by engaging in
  usual preventative health interventions, “as many of the health conditions
  potentially associated with PFAS are common in the community and are
  associated with well-established risk factors”. The panel acknowledged their
  recommendation differs from the National Academies of Science Engineering and
  Medicine (NASEM), an independent institution in the United States, whose
  guidance documents recommended individual blood testing and the use of blood
  levels to inform clinical care. They also noted the Agency for Toxic
  Substances and Disease Registry, overseen by the US Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention, gives advice to clinicians on managing and evaluating
  Pfas exposure and has not adopted NASEM’s recommendations on individual blood
  testing and health-based screening based on Pfas blood levels. Jon Dee, the
  convener of the Stop Pfas community group in the Blue Mountains, said 25
  people in the area had paid $500 out of pocket to have the blood test for
  Pfas. Dee said they wanted to see how their blood test compared with the areas
  of Williamtown, Oakey and Katherine, which were contaminated with Pfas due to
  firefighting activities on nearby defence force bases. “If you look at the
  average blood test level of people in the Blue Mountains, we are two to three
  times higher than the average Pfas levels in those defence communities that
  have been compensated by the federal government,” Dee said. Dee said what
  concerned the community was how many of them with high Pfas levels in their
  blood have also had health issues that have been known to be associated with
  Pfas, including cancer. “It’s been totally ignored by NSW Health … We’ve
  demanded free blood tests for everyone else.” Dee said the group was taking a
  class action against the New South Wales government and Sydney Water. “The
  findings of this report clearly are more to do with reducing the legal
  liability of Sydney Water than actually looking after the health of people in
  the Blue Mountains,” Dee said. The panel acknowledged genuine concern in
  communities about Pfas exposure. “There is considerable concern, particularly
  in the Blue Mountains community, about exposure to Pfas through drinking
  water, and NSW Health takes these concerns very seriously,” Chant said. “NSW
  Health will continue to support local clinicians with information for GPs who
  may be managing patients with concerns about Pfas exposure including evidence
  about potential adverse health effects, counselling patients, the utility of
  blood tests for Pfas and the role of further investigations.”
