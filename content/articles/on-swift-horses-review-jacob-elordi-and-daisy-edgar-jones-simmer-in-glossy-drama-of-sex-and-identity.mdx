  On Swift Horses review – Jacob Elordi and Daisy Edgar-Jones simmer in glossy
  drama of sex and identity
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-09-03T10:00:21Z'
bodyText: >-
  Making a bid for awards credibility – somewhat tentatively – is this
  absorbing, detailed melodrama, adapted by screenwriter Bryce Kass from Shannon
  Pufahl’s 50s-set 2019 novel. Kass begins with a narrative feint: after some
  dutiful lovemaking with husband Lee (Will Poulter), young bride Muriel (Daisy
  Edgar-Jones) spies Lee’s studly drifter brother Julius (Jacob Elordi)
  sprawling shirtless on a station wagon outside, the playing cards in his
  pocket signifying trouble. Things aren’t as hetero as they appear, however:
  Muriel is drawn to Julius for what he represents rather than who he is, cueing
  an atypical love triangle where the protagonists are mostly prised apart, and
  where the optimal outcome may well be for all concerned to pursue their own
  paths. Pufahl’s intention, boosted here by longtime Todd Haynes producer
  Christine Vachon, is to flag that this moment in American life wasn’t entirely
  as staid as we’ve been led to believe, that identities were shifting beneath
  the placid surface of postwar reconstruction. Waitress Muriel gambles on
  racing tips from her regulars, before trysting with a sapphically inclined
  neighbour (Sasha Calle). Julius sells his body to fellow cardsharps and
  becomes a professional peeper, prowling a casino’s eaves to spot blackjack
  cheaters. (Even here, the rising heat obliges him to lose the shirt.) Only
  Poulter’s Lee, upright in flannel, clings to an older, squarer design for
  life, installing his wife in a little box on a California hillside – yet he
  seems as destined for heartbreak as anyone. With TV veteran director Daniel
  Minahan (Six Feet Under, Deadwood) keeping these lonely furrows premium-cable
  handsome, the film’s own secret may be that it is a miniseries squeezed into a
  feature-film closet. (Lorded over by Don Swayze, the casino surely merits its
  own episode.) The minor-key romantic snafu, composed chiefly of undercurrents,
  remains a touch callow to generate the devotional passions of a Far from
  Heaven or Carol; these are just kids, arranged into attractive, affirmative
  poses to feel each another out. Yet Kass and Minahan combine old and new while
  rubbing suggestively against the grain: the familiar pleasures of watching
  charismatic young actors meet the novelty of seeing them plugged into
  situations our period dramas have historically overlooked. • On Swift Horses
  is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.
