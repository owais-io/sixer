webTitle: Champions review – intimate encounter is a voyage round the father
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-06T09:20:35Z'
bodyText: >-
  This is a show about a gay man’s fraught relationship with his father. Andreas
  Constantinou sits in an armchair, naked, silently listening. He has told us
  that, during the Covid pandemic, his father died and so did his mother five
  weeks later. He recorded conversations with them and these are played in
  sometimes repetitive ways, caught between the fuzz of radio tuning. You do not
  get a sense of Constaninou’s mother but his father’s voice is key. He speaks
  of his “disappointment” over his son’s sexuality, of wanting him to be a real
  man and of his dismay when Constantinou, as a child, started to play with
  dolls. The voices pour out of a TV set, radio and gramophone on stage: they
  serve as the equipment for this medium-like encounter, the words of the dead
  for ever living in the air and looping inside Constantinou’s head. His
  recorded voice tells us anecdotally of other gay men he has asked about their
  difficult relationships with their fathers. It is a deeply personal and
  experimental show, evolving slowly and going nowhere particularly.
  Constantinou includes recorded exchanges with a therapist, and there does seem
  to be an intimate, therapeutic element to it. But there is beauty and
  artfulness too: the set is suffused in washes of colour. Giant screens feature
  a wrestling match between two men that leaves the ring for ocean waves and
  meadows. They are arresting images, the bodies of the men filmed close up, the
  aggression in their fight slowly giving way to something more gentle, balletic
  and erotic. There are moments in the father’s homophobia that leave you
  breathless for this son. The ending speaks of acceptance and feels too tidy,
  but it does make the point that there is a choice to reject or accept on both
  sides – for son as well as father, even posthumously. At Pentland theatre,
  Pleasance at EICC, Edinburgh, until 16 August All our Edinburgh festival
