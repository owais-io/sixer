  Tesco’s recently introduced birthday cake sandwich – an unholy assemblage of
  jam, soft cheese, frosting and sprinkles, stuffed between two slices of
  brioche – may well be the world’s most depressing foodstuff, a cake designed
  to be eaten in one go, possibly on your birthday, probably alone. The birthday
  cake sandwich follows hard on the heels of M&amp;S’s strawberries and cream
  sandwich – a UK version of the fruit sandwiches, or furutsu sandos, sold in
  convenience stores in Japan. The M&amp;S sandwich received a certain amount of
  criticism, along with some surprisingly good reviews. But both sandwiches were
  controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich
  contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake
  for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is.
  Aren’t they supposed to be savoury? Aren’t they supposed to be lunch, rather
  than dessert? Bur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon – anything with jam in it
  counts – and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it’s more of
  a continuous trial-and-error process – even as you eat a sandwich you’ve just
  made, you’re thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to
  sweet fillings, you’ve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of
  hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started. A note: most sweet sandwiches do
  not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to
  experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions – you may as well
  have it the way you want it. First up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly
  (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite’s
  Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&amp;J is already a sweet sandwich – but
  the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat
  into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis. The recipe offers two extra
  options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white
  chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?). A sturdy sourdough bread is
  recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick – of no consequence
  taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with
  the fillings. Slap it together as you normally would, dip the whole thing into
  the batter, and deep fry it in hot oil, flipping once. If you’re looking for
  rare examples of foodstuffs that are not improved by deep-frying, you can
  start here. You could tinker with proportions all day and still not make
  something palatable out of this heavy, greasy, sticky mess. In case it was
  just me, I forced some on my oldest son, who simply shook, went quiet, then
  said, no. Other sweet fried sandwiches include the grilled Nutella banana
  sandwich, a grilled Nutella and marshmallow sandwich and the banana french
  toast sandwich. The classic Monte Christo sandwich, while technically savoury
  (it’s ham and cheese on french toast), is traditionally served in the US
  dredged in icing sugar, with jam. As an American, I apologise. The Japanese
  strawberry and cream sandwich – or ichigo sando – on which M&amp;S based its
  version, is easy enough to recreate at home. Just watch recipe developer Marc
  Matsumoto. I substituted brioche slices for the authentic Japanese milk bread:
  it’s easier to find. First, carefully wash, top and dry your strawberries –
  five per sandwich. Whip a generous quantity of double cream, sweeten to taste
  and set aside. The final key component in this recipe is strawberry jam –
  spread a thin layer on both bread slices and heap the whipped cream on top in
  shallow pyramids. On one half push your largest strawberry into the centre of
  the cream and then position four more round it, pointy ends facing the corners
  of the bread. Place the other slice on top and gently push down at the corners
  and edges until the top is sort of domed and the edges of both slices are
  nearly touching. Now wrap the whole thing snugly in cling film and leave in
  the fridge until it firms up – about half an hour. Then remove, unwrap and
  slice crossways. If you’ve been careful, you should end up cutting right
  through the middle of three strawberries – presentation counts. This is
  delicious, and why shouldn’t it be? Ultimately, what’s not to like? Jam,
  strawberries, cream, brioche – it’s basically a Victoria sponge. If you’re
  after a more decorative fruit sando, you can make these rather sophisticated
  flower versions using grapes, kiwi, tangerines and strawberries. The ice-cream
  sandwich was invented in New York City at the turn of the last century, as an
  improvement on small slabs of ice-cream served between sheets of paper by
  street vendors. The idea caught on. “There are ham sandwiches and salmon
  sandwiches and cheese sandwiches and several other kinds of sandwiches,”
  announced the New York Mail and Express in 1899, “but the latest is the
  ice-cream sandwich.” They cost a penny, and quickly became a fad. It’s hard to
  be precise about what went on the outside of those first ice-cream sandwiches.
  A reporter sent out to investigate by the New York Sun in 1901 described it as
  “a thin, delicate, freshly baked and altogether agreeable sweet cracker”. The
  ones I remember from childhood were chocolate, rectangular and pleasingly
  bland. This recipe is a decent approximation, without getting too complicated
  – flour, sugar, cocoa powder, butter, bicarbonate of soda, a pinch of salt,
  milk and a few drops of vanilla, whisked to a smooth consistency, dropped in
  uniform spoonfuls on to a lined baking tray and baked for about 10 minutes,
  but keep an eye on them. Once they’re cool, they need to be frozen for an hour
  before they’re stiff enough to squish a scoop of ice-cream between. Refreeze
  until needed. This recipe contains an important advisory: the ice-cream must
  be of the worst sort – soft and airy – for this to work. The ice-cream
  sandwich isn’t everybody’s idea of a good time – a lot of people don’t like
  biting into ice-cream – but I would eat these for breakfast. Other variations
  include the chocolate chip cookie ice-cream sandwich and the Italian brioche
  con gelato, which is literally some ice-cream in a bun (apparently Sicilians
  do eat these for breakfast). The apple pie panini sounds plausible enough:
  take the basic constituents of an apple pie, jam them between two slices of
  bread and toast. This recipe, from justataste.com, combines thinly sliced
  apple, mascarpone whipped with honey, and bread (they use raisin bread, but I
  couldn’t find any, so I returned to my brioche loaf). My version, alas, was
  not an unalloyed success: the mascarpone melted and leaked out everywhere,
  while the apples remained uncooked, and the brioche went gluey in the heat of
  the sandwich press. It could work with different bread and different filling,
  but that, I think, would be a different sandwich. Finally, if you are so
  minded, you can reproduce your own birthday cake sandwich at home, such as
  this one from Love in My Oven. A cake sandwich is, after all, just a cake with
  the icing on the inside – the “bread” here is just a sheet of sponge. This
  recipe is loosely based on sandwich cakes currently available from vending
  machines in US shopping malls. But if you’re going to produce a single slice
  of cake for your birthday, it seems somehow fitting that you should have to
  make it yourself. Many happy returns.
