  The US office of special counsel, an independent federal agency, confirmed to
  NBC News that it is investigating former Department of Justice prosecutor Jack
  Smith for possible violations of the Hatch Act. Smith led investigations into
  Donald Trump’s part in the 6 January US Capitol riot and alleged mishandling
  of classified documents. It comes as senior Republican lawmakers condemn the
  decision of their party leader, Trump, to fire the leading US labor market
  statistician after a report that showed the national economy added just 73,000
  jobs – far fewer than expected – in July. Trump claimed, without evidence,
  that the numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look
  bad” and the US economy was, in fact, “BOOMING” on his watch. Here are the key
  US politics stories of the day: Inquiry into ex-special counsel Jack Smith
  over Trump investigations The confirmation of an investigation into Jack Smith
  comes after Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, a Republican, requested last week
  that Smith be investigated for “unprecedented interference in the 2024
  election”. The Hatch Act, a federal law passed in 1939, limits certain
  political activities of federal employees. Trump, along with other prominent
  Republican lawmakers, have argued that Smith’s investigations into Trump
  amounted to illegal political activity. Smith ultimately brought two criminal
  indictments against Trump in 2023 but resigned in January this year before
  either came to trial. Read the full story Republicans slam Trump’s firing of
  Bureau of Labor Statistics chief The firing of Erika McEntarfer, who had been
  confirmed to her role in January 2024 during Joe Biden’s presidency, has
  alarmed members of Trump’s own party. “If the president is firing the
  statistician because he doesn’t like the numbers but they are accurate, then
  that’s a problem,” said Wyoming Republican senator Cynthia Lummis. “It’s not
  the statistician’s fault if the numbers are accurate and that they’re not what
  the president had hoped for.” Kentucky senator Rand Paul, another Republican,
  questioned whether McEntarfer’s firing was an effective way of improving the
  numbers. Read the full story Trump says Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’s past comments
  make pardoning him ‘more difficult’ Donald Trump says he considers Sean
  ‘“Diddy” Combs “sort of half-innocent” despite his criminal conviction in
  federal court in July – but the president called pardoning the music mogul
  “more difficult” because of past criticism. “When I ran for office, he was
  very hostile,” Trump said of the Bad Boy Records founder. “It’s hard, you
  know? We’re human beings. And we don’t like to have things cloud our judgment,
  right? But when you knew someone and you were fine, and then you run for
  office, and he made some terrible statements.” Combs was found guilty on 2
  July of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, with each
  leaving him facing up to 10 years in prison – but he was acquitted of more
  serious sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. Read the full
  story Analysis: Durham disclosures further undermine Gabbard’s claims of plot
  against Trump Tulsi Gabbard, the director of US national intelligence, hoped
  to uncover evidence that Barack Obama and his national security team conspired
  to undermine Donald Trump in a slow-motion coup. But a previously classified
  annexe to a report by another special counsel, John Durham – appointed towards
  the end of Trump’s first presidency – has further undermined Gabbard’s case.
  It confirms that Russian spies were behind the emails that were originally
  released as the result of a Russian cyber-hack of internal Democratic
  information channels and which Trump supporters believed showed the campaign
  of Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, conspiring to accuse him of colluding
  with Moscow. Read the full story What else happened today: The Trump
  administration terminated 1,902 National Institutes of Health grants totalling
  more than $4.4bn between January and the end of July, according to Grant
  Witness data. NIH followed guidance from the so-called “department of
  government efficiency” (Doge) and Trump’s executive orders to cut costs.
  According to Donald Trump’s White House, the US economy is booming, inflation
  is dead and jobs are surging. A blizzard of economic reports has cast a pall
  on such claims in recent days. Catching up? Here’s what happened 1 August
  2025.
