  Good morning. At least 27 people were killed by Israeli forces while trying to
  get food and six others died from starvation or malnutrition in Gaza on
  Sunday, Palestinian officials said, amid a regional outcry over the visit by
  Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to Jerusalem’s
  most sensitive holy site. Witnesses said Israeli forces fired on hungry crowds
  who were attempting to get food aid from a distribution site run by the
  US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the south of the territory,
  with some describing the firing as indiscriminate. Sunday’s killings were the
  latest in a string of deadly shootings targeting hungry people. At least 1,400
  people have been killed while seeking food since 27 May, most of them near GHF
  sites, while others were killed along the routes of aid convoys, the UN said
  on Friday. The GHF says it only uses pepper spray or fires warning shots to
  control crowds. Where did Ben-Gvir visit and what was the reaction? Ben-Gvir
  led prayers at al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, provoking outrage
  among regional powers. The compound, which Jews call the Temple Mount, is a
  highly revered site – the holiest in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam.
  The site is under Jordanian custodianship; under a decades-old agreement, Jews
  are allowed to visit but not pray there. Texas Democrats leave state to
  prevent vote on redrawing congressional map Texas Democrats are leaving the
  state to prevent a vote today that could create five new Republican-leaning
  seats in the House of Representatives. About 30 Democrats said they planned to
  decamp to Illinois, where they plan to stay for a week, to thwart Republican
  efforts by denying them a quorum, or the minimum number of members to validate
  the vote’s proceedings. In a statement, Texas Democrats accused their
  counterparts, the Texas Republicans, of a “cowardly” surrender to Donald
  Trump’s call for a redrawing of the congressional map to “continue pushing his
  disastrous policies”. What do the Republicans want to do? Last week, Texas
  Republicans released a proposed new congressional map that would give the GOP
  a path to pick up five seats in next year’s midterm elections, typically when
  the governing party loses representation in Congress. Montana shooting victims
  named as manhunt for suspect continues Montana’s attorney general on Sunday

  bar two days earlier. The victims were Daniel Edwin Ballie, 59; Nancy Lauretta
  Kelly, 64; David Allen Leach, 70; and Tony Wayne Palm, 74. All four were
  residents of Anaconda, Montana, where the quadruple murder took place, a
  statement from Austin Knudsen, said. A former US army soldier, Michael Paul
  Brown, 45, is suspected of having killed Ballie, Kelly, Leach and Palm at the
  Owl Bar in Anaconda. Kelly was a bartender and the others were patrons,
  Knudsen said at a news conference yesterday. Has Brown been caught? Brown

  armed as well as getting around in a stolen car containing clothes and camping
  gear. In other news … Attorneys for the Trump administration have denied the
