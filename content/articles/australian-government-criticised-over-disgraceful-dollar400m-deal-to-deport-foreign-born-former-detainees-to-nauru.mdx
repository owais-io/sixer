  Australian government criticised over ‘disgraceful’ $400m deal to deport
  foreign-born former detainees to Nauru

  Human rights lawyers, refugee advocates and the Greens have accused the
  Albanese government of striking a “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous”
  deal to deport hundreds of foreign-born former detainees at a cost of almost
  half a billion dollars. On Friday Australia and Nauru signed a memorandum of
  understanding allowing the government to deport about 280 members of the NZYQ
  cohort, a group of noncitizens living in the Australian community whose visas
  were cancelled on character grounds. This cohort previously faced indefinite
  immigration detention and cannot be deported to their home countries because
  they face persecution, or because those countries have refused to accept them.
  A deal struck by the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, and Nauru’s president,
  David Adeang, will allow these people to be deported in return for an upfront
  payment of about $400m to Nauru, followed by annual payments of $70m a year
  for related costs. The deal follows a November 2023 high court ruling, which
  found it was unlawful for the government to indefinitely detain a person if
  there was “no real prospect” of them being removed from the country “in the
  reasonably foreseeable future”. The ruling saw a cohort of individuals
  released from immigration detention into the community. In a statement, Burke
  said “anyone who doesn’t have a valid visa should leave the country” and that
  “this is a fundamental element of a functioning visa system.” Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email But the deal has been condemned by the Human Rights Law
  Centre’s legal director, Sanmati Verma, who said some of the NZYQ cohort had
  “never been convicted of an offence”. “Others spent five times as long locked
  up in indefinite detention as they were sentenced to serve in prison,” Verma
  said. “Others are elderly and sick, and might die on Nauru without proper
  care.” The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre’s deputy chief executive, Jana
  Favero, said the deal was “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous” and
  showed that in Australia, “some people will be punished simply because of
  where they were born”. Similar statements have been issued by the Refugee
  Advice and Casework Service and by Greens senator David Shoebridge, who has
  accused the government of “forcing our smaller neighbours to become 21st
  century prison colonies”. In a statement uploaded to the home affairs
  department website on Friday afternoon, Burke said the deal “contains
  undertakings for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who
  have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru”. The
  statement said Australia’s funding would “underpin this arrangement and
  support Nauru’s long-term economic resilience”. Australia and Nauru struck a
  financial deal to resettle three members of the NZYQ cohort in February, who
  were described by the federal government as violent offenders. At the time,
  Adeang said the three men had “served their time” in Australian prisons and
  were no longer subject to any punishment. They were granted 30-year visas and
  the right to settle and work in Nauru. “Australia is trying to send them back
  to their country but they are not wanted back home,” Adeang said in February.
  “So we accepted them from Australia. They are not Australian and Australia
  doesn’t want them.” But the three men have lodged a series of appeals against
  their deportation, after they were found not to be refugees and not owed
  protection. This new memorandum of understanding provides the basis for more
  members of the NZYQ cohort to be deported to Nauru. It is not known whether
  future deportations will be subject to legal challenge. Earlier this week, the
  federal government introduced an amendment that would explicitly remove
  procedural fairness in deportation decisions for foreign-born criminals,
  including those in the NZYQ cohort. On Thursday, Burke said the legislation
  would “expressly exclude procedural fairness from applying” when the
  government sought to deport noncitizens who have lost their visa. Speaking to
  parliament, Burke said principles of “procedural fairness” needed to be
  suspended in some cases because those provisions “are being used by
  noncitizens to delay and frustrate their removal, at cost to the commonwealth
  in circumstances where it is neither necessary nor appropriate for it to
  continue to apply”. Burke said the bill would mean that actions taken by
  government in order to resettle someone in a third country “are not
  conditioned on an obligation to afford procedural fairness”. The Senate on
  Thursday rejected a Greens push for an inquiry into the legislation, which
  Shoebridge slammed as “one of the nastiest, meanest attacks” on multicultural
  Australia. Shoebridge also accused the government of trying to “sneak through”
  the legislation, which was introduced just an hour before the government
  announced Asio’s assessment that Iran had directed antisemitic attacks in
  Australia.
