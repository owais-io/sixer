  Aid workers have said Israel’s new measures – meant to improve the
  humanitarian situation in Gaza – fall far short of what is needed and aid
  access continues to be blocked amid the population’s spiralling famine. The
  new measures, which came into effect on Sunday and include daily humanitarian
  pauses, as well as airdropped aid and humanitarian corridors for UN aid
  trucks, were announced by Israel as international pressure mounted to
  alleviate the hunger crisis. Aid groups have said Israel’s blockade of
  humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip is the principal cause of the starvation
  crisis, which has seen 151 Palestinians die of hunger, more than half of whom
  died in the past month alone. While the crisis has deepened, Israel’s military
  has continued its attacks, killing at least 48 people seeking aid in Gaza on
  Wednesday, according to the territory’s ministry of health. “Twenty-one months
  in, these are token gestures. They’re theatrics, they’re designed from my
  perspective to deflect scrutiny. We’re being blocked and delayed at every
  turn,” said Bushra Khalidi, the policy lead at Oxfam, commenting on the new
  Israeli aid measures. Most of the crossings into Gaza are still not in use.
  The UN has called for a full ceasefire and for Israel to allow humanitarian
  aid into the territory to urgently address the hunger crisis. The number of
  aid trucks that have been entering Gaza since the new measures were announced
  has increased, with more than 200 trucks entering on Tuesday, according to
  Israeli customs authority (COGAT). This equates to about 70 trucks entering
  daily on average since May. However, the number of aid trucks still falls far
  below the 500-600 trucks the UN has said is necessary to sustain the 2 million
  residents of Gaza. Some aid agencies have suggested the true scale of need is
  now far greater than 600 trucks, given that Gaza is now facing famine. “The
  needs are exponentially greater than they were prewar. But the access is
  actually worse. Starvation cannot be solved by 10 or even 300 trucks. What’s
  needed isn’t piecemeal fixes, but actual systemic changes,” Khalidi said.
  Residents and medical professionals said they have yet to feel a change to
  their daily conditions, with malnutrition continuing to grip the territory.
  “We are hearing a lot of news that more aid will come, but this is just in the
  media. The situation on the ground has not changed since Sunday. The food
  supply has not reached the target population,” said Dr Nouraldin Alamassi of
  the Project Hope NGO medical team in Gaza. He added that malnourished children
  continue to come to his clinic for food each day while his patient load is at
  double capacity, and that he has no remaining “high energy biscuits” used to
  treat malnutrition to give them. Despite the announcement of increased aid
  measures, humanitarians working at international organisations have said that
  behind the scenes, new bureaucratic obstacles continue to be thrown up that
  prevent them from importing aid into Gaza. These include the new registration
  process for international NGOs, which requires non-UN aid organisations to
  register with the newly established Israeli Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and
  Combating Antisemitism. As part of the registration process, INGOs have been
  asked to submit identification details of their Palestinian staff, which most
  are refusing to do as they fear it will have implications for the staff’s
  safety in Gaza and the West Bank. They point to the high number of
  humanitarians killed by Israel in Gaza as an indicator of the risk involved in
  providing information about their staff to Israel. It is unclear if Israel
  will allow them to register without providing that information. Some INGOs
  that have yet to receive their registration from the new Israeli ministry have
  had their imports into Gaza delayed indefinitely by Israeli customs, according
  to humanitarians familiar with supply chain logistics in Gaza and have had
  their own imports delayed. They fear customs officials will not allow them to
  import goods into Gaza without being registered in Israel, jeopardising their
  ability to send aid into the besieged territory. “While the clear violations
  on the ground in Gaza has a major impact on public opinion, the violations of
  access via bureaucracy don’t have the same impact on people because it’s
  boring and complicated. But this is what is stopping aid from getting in,” a
  humanitarian who works in Gaza aid supply chain management said anonymously as
  they were not allowed to talk to media. Asking for clarification from the
  customs body has not yielded any answers, something the humanitarians said was
  part of a “deliberate policy” to make bringing aid into Gaza as complicated as
  possible. Explanations from customs officials for rejected or delayed aid
  imports into Gaza was rare, they said, leaving humanitarians to try to guess
  what was allowed in. The humanitarian said dates and olives were consistently
  thrown out by Israeli customs official without explanation. After pooling
  their experiences with other aid groups, they realised the common denominator
  was fruits or vegetables with pits or seeds that could be planted. Later
  shipments that contained date paste and pitted olives were let in the
  territory successfully. Neither COGAT nor the Israeli Ministry for Diaspora
  Affairs and Combating Antisemitism responded to a request for comment. While
  the new aid measures announced by Israel were a start, some UN officials said
  that if viewed holistically, aid access was still nowhere near what is needed.
  “It’s always give with one hand, take away with the other,” said Sam Rose, the
  acting director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza.
