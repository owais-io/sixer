  The EU’s ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, also responded to the
  attack, saying that the EU delegation’s building was “severely damaged by the
  shock wave.” This is Moscow’s true answer to peace efforts. European Council
  president António Costa also condemned the attack, saying he was “horrified”
  by the overnight strikes on Ukraine. He also expressed his solidarity with the
  victims and the staff of the EU’s delegation to Ukraine, claiming the Russian
  attack on the bloc’s diplomatic representation was “deliberate.” “The EU will
  not be intimidated. Russia’s aggression only strengthens our resolve to stand
  with Ukraine and its people,” he said. European Commission president Ursula
  von der Leyen has confirmed that the staff of the EU delegation in Kyiv was
  safe after the overnight Russian attack on Kyiv that hit its building. In a
  post on X, she said: “Another night of Russia’s relentless bombings struck
  civilian infrastructure and killed innocents. It also hit our EU Delegation in
  Kyiv. Our Delegation staff is safe. Russia must stop its indiscriminatory
  attacks on civilian infrastructure immediately and join negotiations for a
  just and lasting peace.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy just said the
  death toll of the overnight attack on Kyiv rose to 14, including three
  children. He called it a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians.” The
  Russians are not choosing to end the war, only new strikes. He added:
  “Overnight in Kyiv, dozens of buildings were damaged: residential houses,
  office centers, civilian enterprises. Among them also the building where the
  European Union Delegation to Ukraine is located.” He urged the world to
  “respond firmly,” as he stressed that “Russia must stop this war it started
  and continues.” “For the spurning of ceasefire and for the constant Russian
  attempts to weasel out of negotiations, new strong sanctions are needed. Only
  this can work. The Russians understand only strength and pressure. For every
  strike, Moscow must feel the consequences.” in Kyiv Looking at first reports
  from the area that was hit by overnight Russian strikes, it appears that the
  British Council’s offices in the centre of Kyiv have been hit, in an attack
  that took place at 5.40am. Their Kyiv building is located very close to the EU
  delegation, and a number of pictures we are getting on the news agencies this
  morning appear to show it damaged by the strikes. We have reached out to the
  British Council to find out if there were any casualties and to get a
  statement. It is understood the organisation, which promotes the UK and
  English teaching abroad, is establishing what happened. Russian airstrikes
  have killed at least twelve people in a succession of attacks on Kyiv
  overnight and wounded dozens more in the most deadly night raid on the
  Ukrainian capital for several weeks. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who
  revealed that a child was among the dead, said the attacks showed that Russia
  had no intention of negotiating an end the war, despite the recent
  intervention of US president Donald Trump. The EU’s enlargement commissioner,
  Marta Kos, said the EU delegation in Kyiv was also damaged by the strikes. “I
  strongly condemn these brutal attacks, a clear sign that Russia rejects peace
  &amp; chooses terror. Our full solidarity goes to EU staff, their families,
  &amp; all Ukrainians enduring this aggression,” she said. The attack comes
  amid growing doubts over whether Russia is genuinely interested in continuing
  the Trump-led peace process, which was discussed with Vladimir Putin in
  Anchorage, Alaska, as European leaders call it out as delay tactics that lead
  to nowhere. We should hear more about it later today, with the European
  Commission set to brief journalists at its usual midday briefing. Separately,
  EU defence and foreign ministers are meeting in Copenhagen tonight ahead an
  informal meeting focused on discussing the bloc’s next steps on Ukraine, with
  security guarantees high on the agenda. I will bring you all the key updates
  here. It’s Thursday, 28 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe
  Live. Good morning.
