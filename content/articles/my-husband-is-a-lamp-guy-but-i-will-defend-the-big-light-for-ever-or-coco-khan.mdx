  If there is one thing I have learned from a life lived on the internet, it is
  that being sent into a spiral of existential dread can come from the
  unlikeliest of places. And what could be more unlikely than wondering about
  the dire prospects of humankind through the prism of the Big Light? That’s
  right, the lightbulb in the middle of the ceiling, the main light, the one
  operated from the wall switch that you instinctively feel around for when you
  enter a room. If TikTok is to be believed, people around the world are saying
  “Down with the Big Light”, with videos that urge viewers never to use it and
  claim turning it on is a dating red flag garnering millions of views – all of
  which has left me wondering: truly, is nothing sacred? I confess that
  defending the Big Light has long been a personal mission. My husband is a lamp
  guy. He values “mood”, whereas if I am unable to read a clothing care label or
  find a contact lens because it’s so dark, the only mood I find myself in is
  “fuming”. I don’t want to have to scuttle around a room turning on five lamps
  to achieve the amount of light the Big Light delivers. Even among our friends,
  the tide has turned, with one now openly trading in Big-Light falsehoods:
  “They are always just horrible blue lights beaming down on you, like you are
  being interrogated.” But as the anti-Big Light sheeple gather momentum, let me
  be the lone voice of reason: the Big Light is good. We would miss it if it
  went. Yes, it has its limitations, but it’s practical, affordable,
  egalitarian, and it lays the foundation for a quality of life for anyone in
  that room no matter where they stand. Must we tear it down? Why can’t we work
  with it, and add lamps to complement it; why can’t we improve it and, in doing
  so, improve ourselves? Indeed, this is a sentiment I find myself expressing a
  lot these days – whether it’s when I’m talking to people about the BBC and
  getting rid of the licence fee, or the UN. And now, yes, the Big Light! As I
  say, existential dread can come from the strangest of places … Coco Khan is a
