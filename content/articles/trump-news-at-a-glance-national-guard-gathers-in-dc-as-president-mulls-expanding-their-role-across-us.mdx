  A steady stream of uniformed soldiers arrived at the national guard
  headquarters in Washington on Tuesday for deployment that evening to fight
  crime in the nation’s capital. Donald Trump’s deployment of the 800-strong
  force has been described by Democrats as political theater. With Trump
  threatening to replicate the move in other big cities, Democrats point to
  statistics showing that violent crime in Washington has dropped to historic
  lows in the past two years. About 850 officers and agents took part in a
  “massive law enforcement surge” across Washington DC on Monday night and made
  nearly two dozen arrests, the White House said on Tuesday. Press secretary
  Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “this is only the beginning. Over the course
  of the next month, the Trump administration will relentlessly pursue and
  arrest every violent criminal in the district who breaks the law, undermines
  public safety and endangers law-abiding Americans.” Trump’s intervention has
  been widely condemned as an authoritarian power grab that undermines the
  autonomy of Washington’s DC local government and seeks to distract attention
  from political problems such as the Jeffrey Epstein files. National guard
  arrives in DC as mayors warn of Trump power grab Muriel Bowser, the mayor of
  Washington DC, has pledged to work “side by side” with the federal government
  as national guard troops arrive at their headquarters in the capital. The show
  of force came after Donald Trump announced that he was sending the national
  guard into the capital and putting city police under federal control, even
  though the violent crime rate is at a 30-year low. Read the full story Trump
  could expand role of national guard for ‘quick reaction’ to unrest Donald
  Trump could expand the use of national guard troops in US cities even further,
  if a plan from the Pentagon comes to fruition. The Washington Post, reporting
  on internal documents on Tuesday, says Pentagon officials are “evaluating
  plans” to create a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” that
  would deploy to crack down on cities in events of unrest or during protests.

  that workers around the world are treated fairly and are able to share in the
  benefits of the global economy”. She has deleted her account on X and Facebook

  continued to rise in July, according to key economic data, as Donald Trump’s
  international tariffs shake-up started to impact consumer costs. Catching up?
