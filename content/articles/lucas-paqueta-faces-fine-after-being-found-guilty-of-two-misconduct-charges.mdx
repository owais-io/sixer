  Lucas Paquetá is poised to receive only a fine after being found guilty of two
  misconduct charges relating to the spot-fixing allegations he was cleared of
  in July. The independent commission that acquitted Paquetá of being
  deliberately booked to fix betting markets upheld two lesser charges against
  him of failing to answer questions and provide information to the FA’s
  investigation, with its written reasons for both verdicts due to be published
  this week. Paquetá will face a separate sanctions hearing to determine his
  precise punishment, but the commission’s report is understood to include a
  submission from the FA that they believe a fine to be appropriate. The West
  Ham forward’s legal team have also made written submissions to the commission
  and may contest the level of any fine imposed by the commission. Paquetá was
  cleared of spot-fixing following a two-year investigation by the FA that cost
  him an £85m move to Manchester City in August 2023. The 28-year-old continued
  to play for West Ham throughout the process, and expressed his gratitude to
  the club by kissing the badge and miming throwing away a mobile phone after
  scoring in last weekend’s 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest. Aston Villa made an
  attempt to sign Paquetá on loan last week, while Tottenham also made a
  tentative inquiry before signing Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig, but neither
  proposed transfer came close to being finalised with the player happy to stay
  at the London Stadium. The publication of the independent commission’s full
  decision is also expected to include a recommendation on which party covers
  the costs of the case. West Ham were unhappy that Paquetá was charged on the
  basis of what they regarded as flimsy evidence, but have opted against taking
  legal action against the FA. After he was cleared of spot fixing, Paquetá said
  in a statement: “Since the first day of this investigation, I have maintained
  my innocence against these extremely serious accusations. I can’t say anything
  more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and
  how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face. “To my
  wife who never let go of my hand, to West Ham, to the fans who always cheered
  me on, and to my family, friends and the legal team who have supported me –
  thank you for everything.” The FA declined to comment.
