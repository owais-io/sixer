  Michael, 38, London Occupation Data engineer Voting record Usually
  Conservative, but didn’t vote in the last two elections – “The parties seem
  broadly the same. Nobody really stands by the manifesto” Amuse bouche This
  isn’t Michael’s first career – he started his working life as a history
  teacher Sophia, 19, London and Portsmouth Occupation Mainly a student, but
  works on social media and campaigns for the Workers party Voting record The
  Workers party; has also voted Green Amuse bouche Sophia can recite the full
  lyrics to Billy Joel’s We Didn’t Start the Fire. Can also sing it, but only
  when she’s been drinking For starters Michael She was covered in a bunch of
  communist pins; it came off as a little bit of an intentional caricature. My
  first impression was: younger than I thought and wearing her politics on her
  sleeve, literally. Sophia I was expecting someone more rightwing, more
  Reform-like, but I found him pretty interesting, in regard to his abstinence
  from voting and his lack of interest in any of the key parties. Michael I ate
  some salt and pepper squid and a cod loin. Sophia I had the sourdough
  margherita pizza and a couple of glasses of rather nice Romanian red wine. The
  big beef Michael Governments’ first duty of care is to their own citizens,
  which means migration needs to serve the interests of the people already here.
  Relatively unchecked mass migration doesn’t seem to do that. Being someone who
  went through all the legal hoops – moving to the UK from Canada – the idea
  that I could have simply lost my passport, shown up and not had to wait in
  line for anything, that’s not ideal. Not being able to do anything about
  foreign people who take advantage of the UK’s astonishing generosity isn’t
  great. Sophia He was essentially saying, “We need growth but how are migrants
  going to generate that?” He felt that it would be detrimental to the migrants’
  own countries, in that they’d be losing their own assets. But they’re leaving
  because they aren’t seen as assets. They’re leaving because of corruption,
  poverty, different human rights. It’s not as simple as he thinks: migrants
  don’t necessarily have a choice. Michael The situation we’re in serves large
  corporations and keeps everyone addicted to low-wage labour. It makes our GDP
  look good, but it’s reducing our standard of living, and that includes the
  people we’re importing. If we want to help the whole world thrive, are we
  doing anyone else any favours by saying to other countries, “Yes, we’ll have
  all your doctors and nurses, thanks”? Sophia He looked at everything from his
  individual perspective as an economic agent. I think he lacked empathy, and I
  said that to him. He responded that I was being overly idealistic – but he was
  being idealistic as well, in terms of his own capital interests and what
  served them. If I had a penny for every time he called me idealistic, I could
  repair the economic conditions he’s so worried about. Sharing plate Michael
  She was very keen to talk about Gaza. I don’t think either side is very nice
  in this case. I don’t have a strong opinion, except that it is atrocious.
  Sophia I don’t see it as a war. I see it as unjustifiable violence for
  nationalist aims. Having a two-state solution is completely wrong, because
  it’s only rewarding Israel for what it’s done. It should be one democratically
  run state. For afters Michael Everybody should have the right to be left
  alone. When we start having laws around misgendering, I think: look, I prefer
  people to be polite, but people are allowed to be impolite, and making special
  rules based on someone’s whim is weird. Sophia I’m a gender abolitionist. He
  doesn’t like jargon, whereas I quite like that people use labels, because that
  makes it feel more real, as opposed to people thinking they’re abnormal.
  Takeaways Michael I tried to be polite and stay for the duration, while she
  was eating. Looking back, I berate myself for not walking away sooner. It was
  the most communist interrogation a guy can have without ending up with bamboo
  shoots under his nails. Sophia It wasn’t that the conversation dried up or
  that we hated each other; we just said goodbye. I think it was on good terms.
  I was probably not the sort of person he’d choose to interact with. Additional
