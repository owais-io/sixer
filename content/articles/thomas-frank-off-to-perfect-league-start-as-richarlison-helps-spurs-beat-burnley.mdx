  It is hard to imagine how this could have gone any better for Thomas Frank. In
  front of an exuberant home crowd still basking in ending their long wait for a
  trophy, a breathtaking bicycle kick from a rejuvenated Richarlison sealed a
  convincing victory in the Dane’s first Premier League match in charge of
  Tottenham. The new £55m signing Mohammed Kudus was also outstanding as he set
  up both of the Brazilian’s goals before Brennan Johnson rounded things off
  against a Burnley side that proved a tough nut to crack. After conceding the
  opener to Richarlison – who was a bit-part player under Ange Postecoglou last
  season and had been linked with a move away this summer – in the 10th minute,
  Scott Parker’s side had their chances against a Spurs defence that creaked at
  times. They ultimately paid the price of their profligacy but will be
  encouraged by this display. As negotiations with Crystal Palace edge closer
  over a move for Eberechi Eze, these are exciting times for Tottenham
  supporters. Frank showed he is not afraid to gamble by starting the teenagers
  Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall in central midfield and was rewarded with the
  kind of committed performance that so often eluded his predecessor, at least
  in this competition. “That’s our dream start. We all know we need to follow up
  on it, but today I will just enjoy it,” said Frank who, as became customary
  after every home victory during his seven years at Brentford, applauded the
  whole ground on a lap of honour after hugging every member of his staff. Asked
  whether he was still hoping to add players to his squad before the end of the
  transfer window, he added: “We are definitely in the market.” After coming so
  close to winning a trophy in his first match in charge against Paris
  Saint-Germain in the Super Cup, the new head coach was given a rapturous
  reception when he emerged from the tunnel before kick-off. Burnley might have
  set a defensive record in the Championship last season after conceding only 16
  goals but they let in 78 in their last Premier League campaign. Even after
  adding plenty of top-flight experience in Kyle Walker and Martin Dubravka,
  Burnley looked like they knew they were in for a long afternoon from the
  start, especially in only the fourth minute when Dubravka fell foul of tighter
  regulations on goalkeepers holding on to the ball for longer than the
  permitted eight seconds and Tottenham were duly awarded a corner. Parker was
  the last player to leave West Ham for Spurs in 2011 and he watched Kudus make
  an instant impression when he found space down the right flank in the 10th
  minute and whipped in a brilliant cross for Richarlison to finish first time.
  Their travelling supporters probably feared the worst at that point but
  Burnley slowly found their feet as Lyle Foster and Josh Laurent saw efforts go
  wide. Guglielmo Vicario was less than convincing when he had to tip Laurent’s
  deflected shot over, while Frank let out a scream of anger when Walker was
  given too much space to whip in a cross that just eluded Jaidon Anthony on the
  verge of half-time. Adopting a more casual look than Parker’s suit, jacket and
  tie, the Spurs manager was more encouraged by his side’s start to the second
  half. Richarlison should have doubled his tally after his initial effort
  struck Maxime Estève on the shoulder but Dubravka’s outstretched boot did just
  enough to divert the ball wide. Burnley had two chances to make them pay when
  the lively Foster set up Hannibal Mejbri, only for Pape Sarr to make a
  last-ditch tackle before Anthony directed his header straight at Vicario. It
  was to prove crucial. “That’s the ruthlessness of the Premier League,” said
  Parker. “We’ve got a huge challenge ahead of us but it’s one we are going to
  embrace.” With Tottenham’s next attack, Kudus again left his marker for dead
  with a clever piece of skill and Richarlison swivelled in mid-air before
  hammering in his cross. The Brazilian also played his part in the third goal
  when he eluded Estève’s challenge in the centre circle and Sarr was able to
  surge forward to play in Johnson, with last season’s top scorer making no
  mistake. Richarlison left the field to a standing ovation as a new era dawned
  in this part of north London.
