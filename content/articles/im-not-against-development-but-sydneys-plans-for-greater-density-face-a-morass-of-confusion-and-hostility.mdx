  Almost everyone agrees that Australia needs more housing, and nowhere more so
  than in Sydney, which has struggled to escape its reputation as one of the
  most expensive cities in the world to find somewhere to live. The New South
  Wales planning minister, Paul Scully, says the problem of housing supply has
  been ignored for far too long. “For years we have simply not been building
  enough homes in NSW,” he says. “As a result, Sydney has become the
  second-least affordable city in the world and NSW is losing twice as many
  young people as it is gaining. “Does anyone think we can keep doing what we
  have been doing and expect a different result?” But plans from state and local
  government to urgently increase the number of properties through greater
  density have come up against determined opposition. On Friday morning the land
  and environment court set 27 October as the date for a case brought by
  89-year-old Judith Pearson to be heard. Pearson, who lives in Mosman on
  Sydney’s north shore, is believed to be the first individual to mount a legal
  challenge to the state government’s plans. Sign up: AU Breaking News email She
  has framed her objections as a fight to retain the character of her suburb and
  keep it open to a diverse range of income groups. “It became not about me, but
  about us … who live here because of the history, the heritage and the
  importance of having the right environment that we all want to live in,” she
  told a packed meeting of Mosman council in early August. “I am not against
  development, but … early indications are that the planned developments for
  Mosman will only be affordable to the very privileged.” Variations of the same
  argument are raging in different parts of the city, but it’s clear there is no
  straightforward path to satisfying the wishes of residents – and those who
  wish they could afford to be residents. The forest of acronyms Anyone engaged
  in the density question has to come to terms with a forest of initials and
  acronyms. Two of the most dramatic tools to address the problem in NSW are the
  state government’s transport-oriented development (Tod) and low to mid-rise
  housing (LMR) policies. Their broad thrust is to rezone land with the aim of
  fast-tracking 342,000 dwellings close to stations and town centres,,
  transforming suburbs into mini cities, particularly along the metro line.
  Rezoned “accelerated” Tod precincts in Hornsby, Macquarie Park, Kellyville,
  Bella Vista, Bankstown, Crows Nest, Homebush and Bays West allow six-storey
  developments within 1,200 metres of eight transport hubs. An additional 37
  centres within Sydney, Newcastle, Illawarra and the Central Coast have been
  earmarked for six-storey developments within 400m of stations. LMRs are
  designed to boost the diversity of housing stock and will create a tiered
  effect around stations and town centres with mid-rises within the first 400
  metres of a hub, giving way to low rises such as townhouses up to 800 metres
  from hubs. Mosman is one of the areas that falls into this category. Larger
  developments will be approved by the state government, while council panels
  will approve other development applications submitted under Tods and LMRs. But
  the Tods and LMRs are blunt instruments, delivering a top-down mandate to
  culturally, socially, geographically and demographically different areas while
  initially calling for just 2% of the new homes to be affordable. The response
  to the Tod policy – accidentally announced in December 2023 – and to last
  year’s LMRs has been huge. The public exhibition of LMRs alone resulted in
  8,000 submissions. Many feared the plans would drive the construction of bland
  blocks in locales variously known for their leafy streets, close-knit
  communities, creative edge and single-home lots. If nothing else, the policies
  have triggered action on densification at the local level. According to the
  Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure, 11 of 13 Tod-affected
  councils have deferred Tod start dates and 12 have drawn up their own, more
  nuanced alternatives (Newcastle is the only exception). But far from resolving
  anxieties, the counter-proposals appear to have divided communities further.
  ‘A terrible situation’ Heritage is one sticking point. Tods and LMRs do not
  override listed heritage items, but they do apply in heritage conservation
  areas. David Burdon, the conservation director of the National Trust of
  Australia, told a parliamentary inquiry into Tods that heritage conservation
  in NSW was increasingly seen as “optional”. Others take aim at the hard edge
  where high-rise meets land that has not been upzoned. Under the original Tod
  maps issued by the Minns government in 2023, up to six storeys would have been
  allowed on the West Lindfield street where Paul Grimble has lived for 30
  years. Ku-ring-gai’s preferred option, devised after consultation with the
  community, is very different. It wants to go high around Gordon and Lindfield
  stations – up to 28 storeys with heights of up to 93 metres – but to cut back
  on development in heritage areas and limit heights in others. For Grimble, who
  lives 350 metres west of Lindfield station in a single-storey house, the
  revised plan is a disaster. The land where his house and those of his
  neighbours sit will be limited to developments of three storeys and six to
  nine units. Grimble says this will make his house an unattractive proposition
  for developers compared with what it would have been worth under the state
  government’s plan – if he sold he would not be able to buy a similar house in
  the area. “So, nobody in these areas is going to be able to afford to sell.
  Nothing will happen and the council’s promised target of 24,500 apartments
  will come to nothing,” Grimble says. “The council appears to have thrown out
  their own planning rulebook and put us all in a terrible situation.” Worse
  still, he’s about to get a 10-storey building on his back boundary, which was
  approved as a state significant development a few years back. “These
  developments collide with their neighbours over a fence with a height
  difference of 10 storeys to one. The desired ‘harmony’ [of built form] is
  severely disrupted not just for one neighbour but on a whole side of the
  street,” he says. Ku-ring-gai councillor Indu Baluchandran says: “We recognise
  it’s not perfect … but it’s certainly better than the original Tod in terms of
  preserving neighbourhood character that Ku-ring-gai feels is precious to this
  community.” Not everyone in the area is unhappy. For Gordon lawyer Sarah Hart,
  development is overdue. “If you’re near good public transport, you should
  expect to be around lots of people,” she says. “I had always expected that
  there would be increasing density around stations. “The more people here the
  better, because I would like my local chemist to have a reason to stay open on
  Sundays and I’d like local restaurants to stay open beyond 8pm. We didn’t come
  here because we wanted camellias.” The NSW Department of Planning is due to
  respond to the plan in September, and the council’s land and environment court
  challenge to the validity of the Tod policy is due to be heard in November.
  ‘That’s not planning’ Elsewhere, fears over quality and the lack of
  affordability have stalled the push towards new development. Among the Tod
  critics is Shelter NSW. In one of the 347 submissions on Hornsby’s accelerated
  Tod, the housing charity said it could not support the Tod because it did not
  meet the 15% affordable housing rate that was part of the state’s “density
  deal” sold to the broader community. That sentiment is perhaps most keenly
  felt in the city’s inner west, an area that has leaped from affordable to
  gentrified in recent years. Eddie Ma, an architect who designs affordable and
  specialist housing, can see Dulwich Hill station from his apartment block. On
  one side of the station are six-storey apartment blocks, on the other,
  single-dwelling houses in a heritage conservation area he would like to see
  preserved. “The Tod didn’t consider local context,” he says. “It’s a two-line
  policy that just says: at these stations, you can build up. That’s not
  planning.” In response, Inner West council proposed its Our Fairer Future plan
  – a block-by-block strategy that goes well beyond the Tod by increasing the
  target number of dwellings for the area from 7,800 over five years to 31,000
  in 15 years. Some buildings may reach 22 storeys, but generally are likely to
  sit between six and 11 storeys – and about 70% of developments will be
  concentrated in three suburbs. “That is never going to deliver a good
  outcome,” says Ma, who is a member of the local Better Futures Coalition. He
  claims the 1,150-page plan was poorly communicated and is unfair. “You have
  one tiny area living with the positives and the negatives of densification and
  the rest of the LGA could fall asleep, wake up 15 years later and nothing
  would have changed.” He believes the plan’s amalgamation incentives – allowing
  developers to build up to 17 storeys depending on the size of the site and its
  active transport provisions – favour large-scale developers. He is
  disheartened by its 2% affordable homes provision, rising to 5% in five years.
  The council’s own affordable housing policy calls for 15% of new builds to be
  affordable. The inner west mayor, Darcy Byrne, is adamant the plan is fairer
  and designed more carefully than the Tod, preserving all heritage conservation
  areas while attempting to become the state’s leader on affordable housing. The
  inner west needed a finer-grained approach than the state’s “completely
  unsubtle, unsophisticated way”, he says, not least because it is already
  densely populated by Australian standards, with diverse ownership and small,
  high-value lot sizes that made amalgamation incentives necessary. Future
  developments, including along Parramatta Road, will balance out initial pushes
  for density elsewhere in the LGA, he says. “One of the reasons that Sydney has
  one of the least affordable housing markets in the world and that young people
  are being forced out of the inner west en masse is because of this debate
  constantly being replayed, in which the voices of young people are
  eliminated,” he says. “What I’m noticing in the community is the proportion of
  people, particularly younger people and essential workers, who are being
  priced out who are saying, ‘No, we have to address this crisis. Let’s find a
  way to do it’.’” Australian cities lag far behind Feasibility studies paint a
  varied picture of how many homes the policies will actually deliver. According
  to the Fairer Future plan, Tods and LMRs in the inner west will result in just
  3,200 homes by 2041, while the council’s alternative will create 5,900 homes.
  Ma says the low numbers are another example of the inadequacy of the policies.
  Stuart Ayres, the chief executive of the Urban Development Institute of
  Australia NSW, says the policies have so far not seen the uptake needed to
  achieve housing objectives – with only 3,500 possible new dwellings across Tod
  and LMR sites being attributed to genuinely new development applications after
  one year. Take-up may be limited by yet another factor. Nicole Gurran, an
  urban planning professor at the University of Sydney, suggests it is better to
  rezone land precinct by precinct, responding to – rather than pre-empting –
  the market. “That way, you’re not artificially raising land value ahead of
  what’s feasible to be developed,” she says. Ehsan Noroozinejad Farsangi, a
  senior researcher at the Urban Transformations Research Centre at Western
  Sydney University, says Australian cities are far behind others, including
  Vancouver and Hong Kong, in implementing policies similar to Tods and LMRs.
  He’s seen them work, but in NSW, he says, “the problem is that, at the moment,
  the government is doing the Tod and the LMR in a top-down approach. It should
  be bottom-up.” “Most of the politicians and government bodies are mainly
  focusing on the quantity rather than quality and community,” he says. “Even if
  that number of houses would be produced in the next five years, the question
  is: what quality will they be? The final outcome should be something livable
  and should be something high quality. Otherwise it’s not working.” Scully is
  determined to persevere in trying to bring the public around to the reforms.
  “Change can be difficult,” he says. “While some opposition is expected, I am
  growing tired of this approach to housing where some people think that the
  best thing they can do is look for new and creative ways to say no to housing
  instead of embracing new and creative ways for their suburb to help tackle our
  housing challenge in a meaningful way.”
