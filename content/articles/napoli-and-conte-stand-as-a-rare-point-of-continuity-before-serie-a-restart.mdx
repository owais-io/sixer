  It did not take long after Napoli had won Serie A in May for some journalists
  to ask whether their manager would desert them. Antonio Conte had grumbled for
  months about transfer decisions. Even in this moment of triumph his body
  language around the owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, remained frosty. Recent
  history hung over Napoli. Luciano Spalletti stepped down after leading the
  Partenopei to a Scudetto in 2023, riding off into the sunset in his newly
  pimped out Fiat Panda and citing a “personality clash” with De Laurentiis. But
  Conte is his own man with his own imperatives. Three months later he stands as
  a rare point of continuity in a league determined to eschew it. Twelve of 20
  clubs have changed manager – a drop, admittedly, from 14 last summer –
  including six of the top eight finishers. Does stability breed success? If so,
  Napoli should begin as clear favourites. No starters have departed, and Kevin
  De Bruyne has arrived – a symbol of raised ambitions for a team chasing their
  third domestic title in four years. Incorporating him will require thought and
  likely some adjustment to last season’s 4-3-3, but should lend variety to a
  side that over-relied on Scott McTominay down the stretch. Nor is De Bruyne
  the only new arrival. Napoli have added the centre-back Sam Beukema from
  Bologna and the Netherlands international Noa Lang on the wing. Romelu Lukaku
  will miss the start of the season with a hamstring injury, but that at least
  will give the 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca a chance to prove his worth after
  joining from Udinese. Who will challenge them? Inter remain the most likely
  contenders, even after a humiliating end to the last campaign, when they
  spiralled from chasing four trophies to winning none and getting trounced in
  the Champions League final. They have lost no starters from a squad widely
  perceived as the most talented in Italy and added interesting young talents.
  The wide forward Ange-Yoan Bonny has an eye-catching combination of size and
  acceleration. The midfielder Petar Sucic is an established Croatia
  international at 21 years old. Signing Luis Henrique from Ligue 1, right after
  having dreams crushed by Luis Enrique from Ligue 1, is poetic perfection. The
  big question is whether Cristian Chivu is the right man to lead Inter. Hired
  in a hurry after Simone Inzaghi left for Al-Hilal, he barely had time to get
  to know his players before the Club World Cup, where the Nerazzurri exited to
  Fluminense in the first knockout round. Chivu arrived with plenty of goodwill,
  having won three league titles at Inter as a player – the last of those as
  part of the 2010 treble. But his prior managerial experience is limited to 13
  games at Parma. Is the Romanian the right man to restore purpose and cohesion
  to a demoralised changing room? For now, any judgment feels like a guess. Who
  else might challenge? Atalanta finished third but their manager of the past
  nine years, Gian Piero Gasperini, has left for Roma, bringing down the curtain
  on the most successful chapter in the club’s history. His replacement, Ivan
  Juric, worked under Gasperini as a player then assistant, potentially
  equipping him to move forward with similar tactical ideas. But he inherits a
  team that sold Capocannoniere Mateo Retegui and may yet lose Ademola Lookman.
  That pair scored more than half of the team’s 78 league goals last season.
  Gasperini’s new project at Roma fascinates. Can he establish the same
  front-footed principles that made Atalanta into Europa League winners and
  regular Champions League qualifiers? Despite a fine for breaching financial
  fair play rules, Roma have made moves. The most intriguing capture might be
  the Brazilian right-back Wesley from Flamengo. But there is curiosity, too,
  around the loan signings Evan Ferguson and Leon Bailey from Premier League
  clubs, each in need of a fresh start. Juventus were the other top-eight side,
  besides Napoli, to retain their manager, albeit the long delay before
  confirming Igor Tudor hardly made it seem like a confident choice. Despite a
  low-key transfer session, there are reasons to believe they might surprise. A
  team who fielded the second-youngest XIs in Serie A last season will have
  another year of experience under their belts, as well as Bremer, possibly the
  best centre-back in the division, back from injury. Juventus are not
  favourites, but Tudor has said he will not content himself with aiming for
  third or fourth. What of Milan? Massimiliano Allegri is back , 14 years after
  leading the Rossoneri to a Serie A title . Luka Modric has joined, 22 years
  after his professional debut. Can the Croatian author one more memorable
  chapter? Tijjani Reijnders and Theo Hernández are gone, and Rafael Leão picked
  up an injury in last week’s cup win over Bari, but there were encouraging
  signs in that performance. A lack of European football may benefit them. Could
  a different club surprise? Como signalled their ambition as they refused to
  entertain Inter’s approach for their manager, Cesc Fàbregas. They have spent
  €100m in this transfer window, adding a wealth of young talent, including
  Jesús Rodríguez from Real Betis and Martin Baturina from Dinamo Zagreb.
  Bologna need to fill gaps left by Beukema and Dan Ndoye, much as they did
  Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirkzee a year ago. Fiorentina appeared to be on
  the right path last season but will their progress be derailed by the
  resignation of the manager Raffaele Palladino, replaced by the returning
  Stefano Pioli? Lazio, too, turned to a familiar face in Maurizio Sarri, but a
  transfer embargo has prevented them from restructuring the squad to fit his
  vision. Of the promoted sides, Fabio Grosso’s Sassuolo look best equipped to
  fight relegation, with Armand Laurienté and Domenico Berardi proven
  commodities in the attack. Andrea Pinamonti is back for now, too, after
  hitting double figures on loan at Genoa. Pisa were promoted playing fast-break
  football under Filippo Inzaghi but appear to be adapting towards a possession
  game with their new manager Alberto Gilardino. Cremonese have hired survival
  specialist Davide Nicola. Verona may be drawn into the battle after another
  transfer window of flogging their most promising young players, this time the
  centre-backs Diego Coppola and Daniele Ghilardi– and rebuilding. Parma, too,
  have been stripped of assets, including Bonny, Simon Sohm, and Dennis Man –
  not to mention Chivu. Lecce hope signing the 17-year-old Francesco Camarda on
  loan from Milan may bolster an attack that scored a league-worst 27 goals last
  season. Cagliari have promoted academy coach – and former Guardian footballer
  of the year – Fabio Pisacane to lead their first team, his first senior
  management role. Above them is a familiar group of teams looking to push on
  from midtable. Kosta Runjaic impressed in his debut Serie A season as manager
  of Udinese, but has lost starters Lucca, Jaka Bijol and Florian Thauvin.
  Torino hired Marco Baroni, who finished seventh with Lazio, and have supplied
  him with new forward talent, but there are questions about balance in
  midfield. Genoa showed marked improvement under Patrick Vieira but have
  undergone significant squad turnover. This feels like another season that
  begins with more question marks than certainties. That has been the way of
  things lately in a league where no team has successfully defended a Scudetto
  for five years. Now Napoli, a club who had won the league only twice in their
  history before this decade, will get another chance.
