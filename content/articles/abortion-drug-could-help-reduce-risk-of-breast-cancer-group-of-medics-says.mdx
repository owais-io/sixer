  A drug used in medical abortions could help prevent women at high risk of
  breast cancer from developing the disease, according to an international group
  of doctors and scientists. However, “stigma” around mifepristone is stopping
  pharmaceutical companies from investigating its potential as a new treatment
  doctors could offer to reduce the risk of breast cancer, they say. Companies
  appear reluctant to carry out trials despite the fact that three previous
  studies all found that the drug shows promise as a way of slowing down the
  growth of cancerous cells. Mifepristone’s role in medical abortions and fact
  that access to abortion is restricted in some countries is preventing
  much-needed research being done, the experts claim. It is one of two drugs,
  alongside misoprostol, that women in the UK take when ending a pregnancy that
  began up to 10 weeks earlier. They take a mifepristone tablet, then wait for
  24-48 hours and then take the misoprostol. “It is deeply disappointing that
  the successful application of mifepristone in one area of clinical medicine is
  hindering more extensive research into other indications that could benefit
  public health,” the opinion piece written by eight co-authors and published in
  The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women’s Health says. All are experts in
  reproductive health or reproductive cancer working in London, Edinburgh,
  Stockholm and Erbil in Iraq. “The time is long overdue to give mifepristone
  the opportunity it deserves to be investigated as a non-surgical option for
  primary prevention [of breast cancer],” they add. Breast cancer is the most
  common female cancer in most countries in the world and kills an estimated
  670,000 women globally every year, according to the World Health Organization.
  Although small-scale, the three previous studies offered evidence mifepristone
  can limit the effect of the hormone progesterone, which drives the cell growth
  found in breast cancer. They were published in 2008, 2022 and 2024.
  Mifepristone is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor
  modulator. If proven to work, it could help women who are at high risk of
  breast cancer, such as those who carry a variant of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
  Currently they are offered surgical options for their treatment, such as a
  mastectomy, or drugs that are of “low efficacy”, the authors say. UK cancer
  charities endorsed the plea for drug companies to look seriously into the role
  mifepristone could play in breast cancer care and for governments to enable
  that to happen by easing regulations that restrict its use to abortion. Dr
  Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: “More
  risk-reducing treatment options for women with a high risk of developing
  breast cancer, that also protects their quality of life, are desperately
  needed. And we need to explore all avenues, including existing drugs, to
  achieve this. “So early research into mifepristone is an important step
  forward and we need further studies to understand if these drugs are safe and
  effective.” Dr Marianne Baker, Cancer Research UK’s science engagement
  manager, said the 57,900 new diagnoses a year of breast cancer in Britain
  showed that “it’s vital we invest in research exploring new ways to prevent
  the disease”. She added: “Cancer develops when cells grow uncontrollably.
  Early studies showed that mifepristone slowed down cell growth in breast
  tissue, so it might be useful in delaying or preventing cancer. “But we need
  more research to understand whether it’s effective, how it works and who would
  benefit most from it.” Prof Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, the piece’s lead
  author, and who heads the department of women’s and children’s health at the
  Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: “Stigma around mifepristone used for
  abortion is describing part of why mifepristone is not more extensively
  researched for prevention of breast cancer. “Taken together, our data support
  the use of mifepristone for prevention of poor prognosis breast cancer. All
  studies were randomised controlled trials using a low dose of mifepristone for
  two or three months.”
