  Good morning. Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy to discuss a peace deal in Ukraine, according to Donald Trump and
  European leaders, although Moscow has not confirmed the meeting. The potential
  breakthrough came after a day of tense diplomacy at the White House in which
  Trump ruled out a ceasefire while Zelenskyy and his allies pushed for
  US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term agreement. The
  Ukrainian president said that security guarantees for Kyiv would be
  “formalized” within 10 days. What was the mood of the talks? Trump’s initial
  conversation with Zelenskyy went more smoothly than their first encounter in
  the Oval Office six months ago, when the Ukrainian leader was berated by Trump
  and vice-president JD Vance. This time, doubtless to the relief of European
  leaders, Zelenskyy gave Trump effusive thanks for the invitation and the pair
  shared good-humored banter. What was discussed? After meeting the leaders of
  Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato, Trump
  wrote on Truth Social that there had been discussion of security guarantees
  and “which guarantees would be provided by the European countries”. The French
  president, Emmanuel Macron, said the talks did not include Kyiv surrendering
  territory to Russia. Hamas says it accepts proposal for Gaza ceasefire and
  release of hostages Hamas officials say they have accepted a proposal for a
  Gaza ceasefire deal that would include the release of half of the
  approximately 20 remaining living Israeli hostages as part of a phased
  resolution to the war, as Gaza health officials said 62,000 Palestinians had
  now been killed in the 22 months of war. The proposed deal follows
  negotiations between Hamas and Egyptian and Qatari officials that have been
  taking place in Cairo in recent days, and comes after the Israeli prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was confronted on Sunday by Israel’s biggest
  protests of the war, which called for a deal to secure the release of the
  hostages. What are the details of the potential ceasefire? The latest Gaza
  ceasefire proposal agreed by Hamas includes a suspension of military
  operations for 60 days and could be seen as a path to reaching a comprehensive
  deal to end the nearly two-year-long war, according to Egyptian sources.
  During the period of suspension, Palestinian prisoners would be exchanged in
  return for half of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. What is the situation
  with evacuating sick Gazan children? An aid group that coordinates medical
  care in the United States for badly injured children from Gaza has said it is
  “distressed” by the US state department’s decision to stop issuing visitor
  visas for Palestinians after far-right influencer Laura Loomer complained
  directly to the secretary of state about their work. Democrats return to Texas
  as California kicks off push to pass new electoral map Texas Democrats
  returned to their state on Monday as California lawmakers kicked off a rapid
  push for voters to approve a new congressional map that could add as many as
  five Democratic seats in the House of Representatives. The Texas Democrats’
  return ends a two-week walkout that stalled the Republican effort to redraw
  the state’s congressional districts to satisfy Donald Trump’s demands to
  reshape the House map in his favor ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The
  California plan was drafted in response to Texas’s push to redraw the
  congressional map there. What’s the context? The protest began on 3 August,
  when dozens of Texas Democrats left the state for Illinois and other blue
  states in a high-stakes bid to deny their Republican colleagues the quorum
  needed to approve the redrawn maps. Although the Democrats’ return allows
  Republicans to advance their redistricting plan, the quorum-breakers have
  declared their two-week walkout a strategic success that set off a
  “redistricting arms race”. In other news … Jasveen Sangha became the fifth and
  final defendant charged in the overdose death of Matthew Perry to strike a
  plea deal on Monday, as she agreed to plead guilty to selling the Friends star
  the drug that killed him. Donald Trump announced yesterday that lawyers are
  drafting an executive order to eliminate mail-in voting, days after Vladimir
  Putin told him US elections were rigged because of postal ballots. Bolivia’s
  presidential election will go to a runoff for the first time with two
  rightwing candidates competing, marking the end of nearly 20 years of leftist
  dominance. Stat of the day: Newsmax to pay $67m to Dominion to settle 2020
  election defamation lawsuit The conservative outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay
  $67m to Dominion Voting Systems to settle a defamation lawsuit over lies about
  voting in the 2020 election. Lies about the security of Dominion voting
  machines became central to Donald Trump’s false claim that the election was
  stolen from him. Don’t miss this: Eva Victor on sexual assault drama Sorry,
  Baby The actor’s directing debut has been acclaimed for reimagining the
  “trauma plot”. Eva Victor talks to the Guardian about standup, bootcamp with
  Barry Jenkins – and what you can learn from working in a bridal shop. Climate
  check: Wildfires in Canada are now burning where they never used to In recent
  weeks, tens of thousands of people in Canada have been evacuated from their
  homes due to the wildfires. But this time the worst fires have been
  concentrated in the prairie provinces and the Atlantic region. Saskatchewan
  and Manitoba have been the worst hit, covering more than 60% of the area
  burned in Canada. Last Thing: How did BuzzBallz become the undisputed drink of
  the summer? When Merrilee Kick invented BuzzBallz in 2009, she was a
  47-year-old teacher from Texas who needed money. Since then, BuzzBallz has
  grown to become the US’s biggest-selling single-serve premixed cocktail. Emma
  Russell explores how it became the essential alcopop at this summer’s picnics,
