  Simon Jenkins claims that students at university face an “academic experience
  that has almost nothing to do with real life” (As thousands more teenagers
  scramble for university places, I have to ask – why?, 14 August). I would
  invite him to join my journalism sessions at the University of Northampton,
  where he would need to finish the day with a radio or TV package plus social
  media content, as well as his written piece for the paper and online. Today’s
  student journalists need to produce far more varied content than when he was
  an editor. His idea of cramming all that learning into two years is nonsense.
  Most students need a year to learn how to manage their lives and studies. And,
  more importantly, a two-year degree would mean teaching all year around, and
  only very privileged students have the luxury of not working in the holidays
  (as well as in termtime) to pay the bills. Universities have changed a lot
  since the days of the people who comment on them in Westminster or Fleet
  Street. In some ways, they are in their ivory towers and we lecturers operate
  in the real world. Adrian Warner Senior lecturer in multimedia sports
  journalism, University of Northampton • So much of Simon Jenkins’ article
  struck chords. I went to university when I was 27, didn’t pay anything, and it
  changed my life. I hated secondary school in the 1960s and couldn’t wait to
  leave, which I did at 17 with no A-levels. I was bored and just wanted to
  leave home and be independent. So I trained as a nurse in the paid,
  apprentice-type course that pertained. It was then that I realised my
  potential, so I went back to college. Nowadays, my route through further
  education and university as an adult would be prohibitively expensive for many
  people, whereas I had an undergraduate grant from the local authority,
  followed by a research scholarship. And I realised that higher education is
  not about earning a higher salary, but learning about a wider world, even if
  you don’t end up at the destination you intended. Perhaps every citizen should
  have a voucher to use for a university opportunity at a time they choose and
  the age that suits them – anywhere between leaving school and entering
  retirement. That would avoid the teenage scramble and contribute to wider
  access to higher education for those who seek it. Jude Anderson Cardiff •
  Simon Jenkins makes pertinent points regarding the changing nature of British
  universities. I lectured at one of Scotland’s ancient universities for 24
  years until I resigned in 2000 because of falling academic standards. The
  final straw was being asked to teach tutorial groups of 20 students (when I
  was an undergraduate in the late 1960s, the tutorial size was four). Rapid
  expansion of student numbers from 1997 onwards hoovered up the less able
  middle class, but did little to attract the gifted working class. The award of
  first- and upper second-class degrees to maintain institutional attractiveness
  has increased at the same time as student abilities and teaching quality have
  fallen. British universities are now commercial degree factories, with no
  vision or wider purpose other than survival in a market. Dr Nick Williams
  Auchenblae, Aberdeenshire • I do agree with Simon Jenkins about the emphasis
  on university courses in this country. When I left school in 1960, university
  was an option only for the very few, even for grammar school pupils like me.
  However, I began work as a trainee librarian and studied via day-release and
  evening classes, all paid for by the local authority, to complete my
  degree-level qualification. I was earning at the same time and gaining
  hands-on experience. When I wanted to return to work after raising a family I
  took an Open University degree, gaining friends and lots of experience as well
  as a degree to update my professional qualifications – again, paid for by
  part-time work. I now have concerns for my eldest grandson, who wants, very
  sensibly, to take an apprenticeship, as I hear that companies are cutting back
  on employees and are not often looking at taking on apprentices. Jean Austin
