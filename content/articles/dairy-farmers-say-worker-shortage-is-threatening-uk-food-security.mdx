  Dairy farmers have warned that a long-running shortage of workers, exacerbated
  by Brexit and the pandemic, has put the UK’s food security under pressure.
  Five in six farmers who have looked for workers said they have received very
  few or zero applications from qualified people for their job vacancies,
  according to a survey of dairy producers by Arla, the UK’s largest dairy
  cooperative and the owner of the Lurpak and Cravendale brands. The fifth
  annual poll of Arla’s 1,900 British dairy farmers has highlighted the
  worsening struggle to find workers with the right skills and experience, with
  79% of farmers highlighting this problem in 2021, rising to 84% this year. The
  difficulties in hiring staff had grown worse since Brexit and the pandemic,
  milk producers reported, as the combination of the end of free movement for EU
  workers and other economic factors since Covid have made it harder to find
  suitable staff, while there has been a similar story across the whole of the
  agricultural sector. Nearly half (48.6%) of those surveyed said it was now
  harder to retain staff than it was before Brexit and the pandemic, while only
  5% said the situation had improved. More than one in 10 (13%) respondents said
  they would leave farming altogether in the next 12 months if there was no
  improvement in labour shortages, and 6% said they had been forced to cut the
  amount of milk they produced. Arla itself has seen a reduction in milk
  producers over the past few years, although production volumes have remained
  constant. Its membership has fallen by about 300, from 2,100 three years ago,
  as farmers have retired or through consolidation of farms, amid a trend for
  keeping larger herds. Arla members represent almost a third of all UK dairy
  farmers. Nearly 200 British dairy farmers quit the industry over the 12 months
  to April 2025, according to the most recent figures from the Agriculture and
  Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), taking the total number of producers to
  7,040. The industry has been warning for some time that a continued exodus of
  dairy farmers could jeopardise the UK’s current self-sufficiency in liquid
  milk. “What we’re seeing is the real impact of these workforce shortages on
  our farming industry, whether that’s in higher costs or lower milk
  production,” said Bas Padberg, managing director of Arla Foods UK. “The effect
  of this is ultimately going to be seen in the price and availability of
  products on the supermarket shelves, affecting the millions of people that
  rely on dairy as a source of nutrition in their diet.” Arla – which, like
  other companies, runs its own apprenticeship schemes as well as industrial
  placements – said the government had acknowledged the ongoing difficulties
  with recruiting staff, and welcomed the focus on talent and development as
  part of the upcoming food strategy. However, Padberg called for “practical
  steps that the industry, the education sector and government can take
  together” to attract more people, especially younger workers, to the dairy
  sector. Dairy, like much of the rest of agriculture, has an ageing workforce
  and nearly half (47%) of farmers are aged 55 and over. Younger workers are
  most likely to enter the industry if it is in the family: two-thirds (66%) of
  farmers said their farms had been passed down at least four generations, while
  only 3% of respondents said they were first-generation.
