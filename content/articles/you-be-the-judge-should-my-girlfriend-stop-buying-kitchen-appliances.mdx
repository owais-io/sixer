  The prosecution: Paul We have a tiny kitchen and Billie doesn’t even use the
  stuff that’s already cluttering our counters My girlfriend of six years,
  Billie, is really into cooking and can’t stop buying appliances. We have a
  tiny kitchen which is full to the rafters of things she no longer uses. Billie
  gets these cooking obsessions and suddenly we have to buy something new to
  satisfy them. We currently have a pizza oven, ice-cream maker, blender and
  breadmaker, all sitting unused, as well as a coffee machine, microwave and all
  the usual appliances. Which means we have zero counter space, so I’ve put my
  foot down. She is the main cook, but I also enjoy it – I bake and love making
  dinner. I just don’t want our kitchen crammed full of clutter any more. The
  final straw came when Billie recently bought a rice cooker. She went behind my
  back and ordered a silly small one. We both love rice, but I usually cook it
  as Billie messes it up. She said she never knows how much water to add, even
  though I’ve taught her. I’m not opposed to a rice cooker – I’m half Indian and
  lots of my family use them – but it’s just the size of the one Billie bought.
  It offends me. She chose the most impractical one going, a tiny little pink
  thing off Amazon that can’t cook rice for more than two people. It takes up
  yet more space that we don’t have, and since we often have friends round for
  dinner, it’s totally pointless. I don’t think all these appliances are
  necessary for cooking, and buying things for our kitchen should be a joint
  decision. Billie also wants an air fryer but I think the time has passed for
  those – they’re so uncool now. She says it will help make our cooking more
  efficient but we don’t have the space. Also, that’s what she said about the
  rice cooker – and it’s categorically untrue. I want her to run appliance
  purchases past me from now on. It’s not a control thing, but I need to know
  before she buys anything else, because we need to move things around to make
  space. She’s taking it too far now. The defence: Billie You need the right
  tools to make good food, and as I do most of the cooking, I like to make life
  easier Cooking is my creative outlet. I love baking cakes for friends and
  running bake sales in the local community. I guess I get a kick out of making
  new recipes and buying appliances that help me with my cooking. Paul and I
  share cooking duties, but it’s still largely my domain. He gets stressed when
  I buy new appliances without running them past him, but I don’t think I need
  to. We’ve been together six years and he knows what I’m like by now. Making
  delicious food requires the proper tools. When I cook, I’m at peace. Each
  gadget is a way to learn something new, try something different. I didn’t grow
  up in a household where cooking was joyful – it was functional, often frantic,
  so I’m probably overcorrecting. The rice cooker has become a point of tension.
  I’ll be honest, I did buy it secretly. Not because I wanted to be sneaky, but
  because I was tired of being told I’d mess up the rice again. It is precise,
  consistent and small. Paul says we don’t have space for it and that it’s
  impractical, but it’s so tiny that I can easily make space for it on the top
  of the fridge. It makes just enough rice for two without me having to worry
  about how much water to add. The air fryer is next. I’ve always wanted one but
  Paul says I have to throw something out to make space. I think an air fryer
  will be great for cooking meat and quick lunches. Paul says they are
  incredibly uncool now and that we don’t have space. Yes, we have a lot of
  appliances, but two of them – the pizza oven and the coffee machine – were
  actually his purchases. I don’t drink coffee and I rarely make pizza. Perhaps
  we should clear the counters together and let go of the gadgets that we both
  don’t use. But that would be uncomfortable for Paul as he’d realise that he is
  also responsible for the lack of space. I don’t think I should apologise for
  the rice cooker because it makes my life easier – and I do most of the
  cooking. Paul needs to check what he buys, too, and realise that the purchases
  I make also make his life easier. The jury of Guardian readers Should Billie’s
  appliances get out of the kitchen? As soon as I read that Paul purchased the
  pizza oven, it became clear that this is a joint issue that they need to sit
  down and sort out together. Paul needs to take some blame for his part in the
  clutter and accept that whimsy has an integral place in the kitchen. Long live
  pink appliances! Abigail, 19 Billie loves cooking and should be free to buy
  the gadgets she wants, and she bought the tiny rice cooker because Paul was
  critical of how she cooked rice. He needs to chill and recognise he’s part of
  the problem, as he bought the pizza oven and coffee machine. Billie has
  suggested a way forward – that they jointly do a declutter and make some more
  space. Paul could embrace this gesture. Jacquie, 56 Paul should understand
  that cooking is a hobby and an outlet for Billie. The rice cooker was a
  genuine attempt to make life easier for them both. If space really is the
  issue, find somewhere to store the appliances outside of the kitchen. Meaghan,
  24 It’s ridiculous to have so many appliances. Just learn to cook rice! It’s
  not nice being in the kitchen when every time you pick something up you also
  knock something over. Jerome, 44 Paul has a pizza oven, for God’s sake! He is
  in no position to lecture Billie. Just use the rice cooker when it’s the two
  of you – and Paul, you can prepare and cook the rice when you have friends
  around for supper. Andrew, 37 Now you be the judge In our online poll, tell us
  if you think Billie should declutter The poll closes on Wednesday 3 September
  at 9am BST Last week’s results We asked whether Farrah should stop burning
  incense. 63% of you said yes – Farrah is guilty 37% of you said no – Farrah is
  not guilty
