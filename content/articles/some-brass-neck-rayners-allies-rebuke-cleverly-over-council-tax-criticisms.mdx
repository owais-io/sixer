  Angela Rayner’s allies have hit back at James Cleverly, accusing the shadow
  housing secretary of having “some brass neck” for criticising the deputy prime
  minister over her council tax arrangements on a property she bought this year.
  Rayner acquired the seaside flat in Hove, East Sussex, for more than £700,000.
  The property is subject to the 100% council tax premium on second homes that
  was introduced in April, which she now pays in full. The Tories, including
  Cleverly, have accused the deputy prime minister of hypocrisy, pointing to her
  role in pushing through those tax rules and demanding clarity over whether she
  had been paying the premium and whether she claimed a single-person discount
  on her Admiralty House flat, the property that came with her ministerial
  position at the beginning of this year. Cleverly said: “She has admitted to
  paying the premium on her flat but she refuses to say whether she has been
  paying the second-homes premium on Admiralty House since it came into force in
  April.” But a Labour source dismissed Cleverly’s criticism as political
  opportunism and called out his own record as a landlord. “James Cleverly has
  some brass neck,” a Labour source said. “Unlike him, Angela has never been a
  landlord or owned a property in London. “The second homes premium was
  introduced by the Tory government while James Cleverly was home secretary, and
  he supported it at every stage. Angela takes her council tax obligations
  seriously and she meets them in full.” A source close to Rayner said her
  housing arrangements reflected her job demands, not tax avoidance. They said
  the nature of her role meant she had often had to be in and around London for
  over a decade, but she had always rented a flat for that purpose, adding that
  she had actually ended the lease on her privately rented flat in London some
  months ago. Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, also weighed in to
  the attacks on Rayner, telling LBC: “I’ve got no issue with her doing well for
  herself at all. I think there are questions around hypocrisy at the moment,
  when she’s changing some of the tax measures around second home ownership and
  questions as to where she is delineating as her primary residence.” Some of
  Rayner’s allies found Holden’s intervention notable given his previous clashes
  with Rayner over her personal tax affairs, including his repeated calls for
  her to clarify historic capital gains tax payments. It has been pointed out by
  some privately that Holden voted for the measures allowing councils to double
  tax on second homes, under the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act, introduced
  by the Conservatives last year. Those rules were brought in to force by
  Rayner’s department in April. A Labour spokesperson defended the policy,
  saying: “We said we would introduce new powers for local communities and we
  have. That’s why councils can opt to add up to 100% to the council tax bills
  of second homes to help local leaders improve the sustainability of
  communities. “We are getting Britain building again after years of failure,
  pushing a planning bill through in the face of opposition from unelected Lords
  and landlords. “We are not in the business of restricting people’s ability to
  own property, but we’re clear that rights come with responsibilities.”
