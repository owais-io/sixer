  She stands before us in a blue gingham frock, towering wig and a “hideous yet
  age-appropriate leisure shoe”. She is Dorothy Blawna-Gale and she is a
  pantomime dame. The creation of Johnny McKnight – Scotland’s finest proponent
  of the form – she is sharp-tongued, lascivious and bumptiously lovable. Unlike
  her usual festive appearances at the Tron in Glasgow and the Macrobert in
  Stirling, she is here, out of season, not just to entertain – which she does
  in abundance – but to educate. In a show that grew out of a lecture at the
  University of Glasgow in memory of the late academic Alasdair Cameron, a
  champion of popular theatre, McKnight and director John Tiffany throw in
  songs, sweets and copious audience interaction to celebrate panto’s radical
  potential. It is very funny, but the real soul of this tremendous show lies in
  the personal story McKnight tells. From his earliest memory of seeing Johnny
  Beattie at the Ayr Gaiety, when he realised “You don’t just see panto; panto
  sees you,” he takes us through his first tentative steps as an actor playing
  the comic silly billy role, hiding behind the character’s asexual charm, and
  then, in 2006, his first dame. But something was wrong: in sticking so rigidly
  to tradition, the tired assumptions, the dated jokes, he was repressing his
  true self and muting the anarchic possibilities of the form. It was time to
  kill the old. In the coming seasons, he upended the cliches, corrected the
  gender balance and acknowledged his own sexuality. By 2018, he was fielding
  two male romantic leads in Mammy Goose and audiences did not just accept it:
  they demanded more. Along the way, he faced sectarianism, homophobia and
  serious ethical questions, but sticking to the principles of always punching
  up, thinking his choices through and representing the marginalised, he
  reclaimed panto’s subversive spirit and made it, hilariously, his own. Oh yes
  he did. At the Traverse, Edinburgh, until 24 August. All our Edinburgh
  festival reviews.
