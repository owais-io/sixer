  There is a fashionable theory among pop revisionists that Kurt Cobain was
  transgender. The evidence is there in the floral dresses, the sexual ambiguity
  and the air of transgression. That the Nirvana star never said anything about
  it, goes the line of thought, only points to the less accommodating mood of
  the grunge-era 1990s. The singer’s suicide at 27 might, in other times, have
  been included in the grim tally of trans death statistics. Three years after
  Cassie Workman told Cobain’s story in Aberdeen, a melancholic spoken-word
  show, Emma Frankland is similarly drawn to reflect on the life of a musician
  who caught the imagination of a generation. Frankland knows the theory is
  unprovable, even a little absurd, but takes heart in the thought that it could
  be true. She refers to Cobain as she/her throughout. Having been a teenage
  grunge obsessive in pre-internet Falmouth, keeping vigil with her best friend
  when news broke of the singer’s death, Frankland can only fantasise about what
  it would have meant for her to have had a trans role model of such fame. What
  if Dave Grohl had revealed the secret to unsuspecting fans? What if Cobain
  herself had sung her truth? How different might trans solidarity have been?
  Hunched over an acoustic guitar in an exact copy of Cobain’s 1993 MTV
  Unplugged clothes – right down to the cigarette burn in the floppy brown
  cardie – she uses this idle fantasy as a way of talking about a deeper truth.
  In a poetic, engagingly spoken performance, directed by Harry Clayton-Wright,
  she moves from humour to anger as she considers the stresses of not being
  seen, not being accepted, not being valued. Even a female Icarus, she says in
  a twist on the classical myth, stretching her glorious wings and coming out to
  the world, might still be constrained, her feathers clipped by an intolerant
  society. •At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 24 August. • All our Edinburgh
  festival reviews
