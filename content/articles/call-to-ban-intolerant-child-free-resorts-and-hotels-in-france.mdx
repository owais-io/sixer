  Child-free resorts and adult-only hotels are discriminatory, risk creating a
  society of intolerance and should be banned, a French senator has said, amid a
  growing debate in France on whether it is inhumane to exclude children from
  holidays. “We can’t organise society by separating children off from ourselves
  in the same way some establishments don’t take dogs,” said Socialist senator
  and former French families minister Laurence Rossignol. “Children aren’t
  troublesome pets.” Last month, the French government’s high commissioner for
  childhood, Sarah El Haïry – who has warned that adult-only holiday resorts
  were “not part of [French] culture, not our philosophy and not what we want to
  see as the norm in our country” – launched a Family Choice award as part of
  what she called a “fight against the new no kids trend”. El Haïry called for
  French parents to vote for their favourite child-friendly locations as a way
  to “put children back at the heart of public space” and stand up to the
  adults-only sector. “No way can we let it take hold in our society that
  children aren’t welcome on a restaurant terrace,” she told Parents magazine.
  But Rossignol said the government must go further, and called for a
  parliamentary debate on her proposal to make it illegal to ban children from
  venues in France. Rossignol said child-free spaces amounted to “organising
  society around people’s intolerance of others” and served to “institutionalise
  and legitimise intolerance”. Rossignol said these resorts “allow people to
  say: ‘I don’t like children and I don’t want to see them.’ And that is not
  acceptable, because to not like children is to not like humanity itself.”
  Child-free resorts and hotels – often advertised with images of relaxed adults
  on sun-loungers undisturbed by kids shouting or dive-bombing in the pool –
  have expanded across the world in recent years, and businesses say demand has
  risen since the Covid lockdowns. For decades, hotels reserved for adults have
  been popular in locations such as Mexico and Central America, Thailand and
  Greece, attracting many northern European tourists, including Germans and
  Britons. South Korea has also seen a rise in child-free cafes and restaurants.
  But France – traditionally family-focused and with one of the highest
  birthrates in Europe – has instead prided itself on its family-friendly
  holiday attractions, from towering hotel waterslides to campsites with kids’
  clubs. France has relatively few adult-only hotels and resorts, estimated to
  account for 3–5% of overall tourism, far less than neighbouring Spain, a
  market leader. As the French birthrate declines and the president, Emmanuel
  Macron, calls for a “demographic rearmament” of pro-child policies, there is
  renewed debate over children’s shrinking place in society. An expert report
  last year on reducing French children’s screen-time said children must be
  given more alternatives to phones and take up their “rightful place” in
  society, including “their right to be noisy”. Véronique Siegel, the president
  of the hotel section of the UMIH trade union, said child-free hotels were
  “extremely rare” in France compared with the total number of tourism
  businesses. She said there was a targeted market and hotels were simply
  meeting clients’ demands. She added: “For people seeking adult destinations,
  if there are none left in France because we’re told it’s illegal, would they
  go to neighbouring European countries, or further afield?” Vincent Lagarde, an
  associate professor of entrepreneurship and business at the University of
  Limoges, who studies the business model of child-free resorts, said the top
  reason holidaymakers chose them was not because they hated children, but
  because they needed a rest. Lagarde said: “There is a kind of physical and
  mental exhaustion in French society right now, a need to switch off from
  professional and family burdens. It’s much more complex than simply not liking
  children, because my research showed that around one-third or more of these
  holidaymakers were exhausted parents who needed a break from their family. It
  wasn’t that they didn’t like children, they just needed a pause from the
  rhythm of the rest of the year. And I also observed teachers, or people who
  work with children. These aren’t people who don’t like kids, but people who
  need a bit of time without them.” Lagarde found the second reason people chose
  child-free resorts was for special time as a couple or with friends – a 2014
  poll in France found that 56% of parents had gone on holiday without their
  children, mostly for romantic mini-breaks. Finally, there was what Lagarde
  called a “perception of luxury” associated with adults-only locations. These
  hotels could charge higher prices simply because there were no children making
  noise. Lagarde said that while French anti-discrimination and trade laws were
  open to interpretation on the issue, no family in France had ever brought a
  legal complaint against a hotel for not admitting children. He said the sector
  was likely to continue to grow steadily in France, in the same way that
  child-free weddings had increased. Jean-Didier Urbain, an anthropologist and
  author of a recent book, What Our Travels Say About Us, said: “There’s a trend
  in society to seek more comfort and relaxation, more time to pause, and this
  is part of that. “Vacations, after all, are traditionally a moment where
  citizens can detach themselves from their social obligations.”
