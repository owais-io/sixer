  Labour’s use of Jimmy Savile’s “toxic” name appeared to be an attempt to
  “deliberately bait” Nigel Farage and would distress survivors of child sexual
  abuse, lawyers for victims of the late TV presenter has said. Alan Collins,
  the head of the abuse team at Hugh James solicitors, said it was “concerning”
  to see Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister, and others use Savile’s name
  to try to “score points over political opponents”. Labour has accused Farage
  and Reform UK of being “on the side of predators like Savile” by opposing the
  Online Safety Act. Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, was the first
  minister to make the comparison when he told Sky News last week: “I see that
  Nigel Farage is already saying that he’s going to overturn these laws. So you
  know, we have people out there who are extreme pornographers, peddling hate,
  peddling violence. Nigel Farage is on their side. “Make no mistake about it,
  if people like Jimmy Savile were alive today, he’d be perpetrating his crimes
  online. And Nigel Farage is saying that he’s on their side.” Kyle defended the
  remark, which was criticised as “one of the most disgusting things a
  politician had ever said” by Reform’s chair, Zia Yusuf. Phillips, who has
  spent years supporting abuse survivors, later said she would like to speak to
  Farage about “one of those modern-day Saviles”, referring to Alexander
  McCartney, who abused at least 70 children online, and “just needed a
  computer”, she said. Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, also refused to
  distance the party from the Savile comparison, telling Sky News that Farage
  was “in effect saying that he is on their side because he’s saying he’s
  wanting to repeal the Online Safety Act”. However, Collins said the comparison
  would have “triggered” distress and trauma among any survivors of child sexual
  abuse, not just those who came into contact with the late Jim’ll Fix It host.
  “Lots of victims who were abused in whatever circumstances, often when they
  are seen by a psychiatrist or a therapist, they will mention the name Savile,
  even though they weren’t his victim, they get triggered by it,” he said. “So
  when it comes up on TV or radio it’s a common refrain that they get triggered
  by it.” Collins said Labour’s use of the name “demonstrates the lack of
  understanding” of its effect on survivors. He added: “One doesn’t want to
  think along these lines but one could think it was an attempt to deliberately
  bait [Farage], so to speak. “His name is so toxic I struggle to understand why
  the government would throw his name out there. It’s really concerning. There
  is nothing constructive in it,” he added. Collins said he was not seeking an
  apology from Labour but would urge Phillips and Kyle to stop repeating
  Savile’s name: “They should stop using it and concentrate on the day job which
  is safeguarding vulnerable people and kids.” Richard Scorer, another solicitor
  who represented Savile’s victims, said it was “completely wrong for any
  politician of any party to seek to score points using the suffering of Savile
  victims”. Scorer, of the law firm Slater and Gordon, said all politicians must
  work constructively to implement in full the recommendations of the
  independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, “which both this government and
  the previous one have so far failed to do”. He added: “Victims and survivors
  want to see action to protect children, not weaponisation of their suffering
  for political purposes.” Hundreds of people targeted by Savile came forward
  after his death in 2011, forcing a reckoning for the BBC and other
  institutions that had lauded one of Britain’s most famous light entertainment
  figures despite repeat concerns about his conduct.
