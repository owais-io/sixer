  There is a brutal ritual involving Australian punters that takes place this
  time of year in Louisiana’s intense summer heat, near the bayous and swamps
  that are home to alligators and venomous cottonmouth snakes. It features
  former Australian rules footballers battling for a single US$3m NFL punting
  contract with the New Orleans Saints. This year’s showdown began with Matt
  Hayball, a former Geelong Cat and the Saints’ incumbent punter, against James
  Burnip, a 198cm rookie from Mount Macedon in Victoria, who just wrapped a
  standout punting career at the University of Alabama. The Saints complicated
  the battle this week by signing a third punter, American Kai Kroeger. Only one
  will survive final cuts on 26 August, when NFL teams must slash their training
  camp rosters from 90 players to 53. The winner will enjoy the spotlight and
  riches of playing in America’s most popular sports league, while the losers
  will be unemployed and left with the long-shot hope one of the other 31 NFL
  teams might need a punter. “It’s the nature of the NFL,” Hayball tells
  Guardian Australia from a boisterous Saints locker room inside the Ochsner
  Sports Performance Center in New Orleans. “You’re always competing for your
  position, and it’s the same for every other player in this building.” This
  isn’t Hayball’s first showdown. Last year he was the rookie and edged out West
  Australian and Saints incumbent punter Lou Hedley. A year before that, it was
  Hedley who was the rookie and ousted the incumbent, US punter Blake Gillikin.
  No NFL team has embraced Australian punters more than the Saints. They prize
  their mobility, toughness and versatile kicking skills, honed from years of
  booting a Sherrin on both feet. Their special teams coordinator, Phil Galiano,
  even dubbed Hayball “The Aussie Flash” last season after a successful fake
  punt saw him dash 11 yards for a first down. Despite the cutthroat stakes,
  Hayball and Burnip maintain a relaxed camaraderie. “There’s only going to be
  one punter at the end of camp, but it’s friendly,” Burnip says. “We still wake
  up, get a coffee together, eat, and head out to practice. We’re trying to make
  each other better.” Hayball says: “James is talented and a good dude. It’s a
  similar situation to last year with Lou. We’re learning from each other while
  competing. But really, we’re competing against ourselves.” The pair are
  graduates of ProKick Australia, the Melbourne-based punting academy that has
  sent several hundred former Australian rules footballers to play for US
  colleges. “Matt was leaving ProKick for the US when I was just starting,”
  Burnip says. “We kept in touch whenever he came back to Australia.” Like many
  before them, both endured the heartbreak of seeing their AFL dreams fade.
  Hayball was raised in Adelaide, played under-18s as a midfielder with the West
  Adelaide Football Club and was drafted by Geelong in 2015. But after three
  years playing for the Cats in the second-tier VFL, he was delisted. He joined
  ProKick, secured a punting scholarship at Florida Atlantic University, and
  later transferred to Tennessee’s Vanderbilt University. Burnip played junior
  footy in the Riddell District Football League but, when it became clear the
  AFL wasn’t in his future, he pivoted. “I found ProKick and the rest is
  history,” he says. Burnip landed at the US college football powerhouse Alabama
  in 2021, won the starting job under its legendary coach Nick Saban, and became
  the Tide’s punter for four seasons – although Saban often referred to him as a
  “rugby player”. While Hayball enters the Saints camp as the incumbent and
  having led the NFL last season in punts downed inside the opponent’s 20-yard
  line, recent history favours the rookie. The Saints have opted for the rookie
  punter in each of the last three training camp duels. Hayball is in the second
  year of a three-year, US$2.84m contract, so has already pocketed close to
  US$1m. Burnip, undrafted at April’s NFL draft, quickly signed a three-year
  US$2.975m free agent deal with the Saints. But with just US$35,000 guaranteed,
  that’s all Burnip will keep if he is cut this month. Kroeger, also a rookie,
  has had a short and tumultuous NFL career. He punted for the University of
  South Carolina the past four years, also was undrafted in April, was signed by
  the New York Jets, waived on 27 July and picked up by the Saints four days
  later. They are all well aware of what the Saints head coach, Kellen Moore,
  and Galiano are looking for. “It’s about consistency, hang time, distance,
  direction, getting the ball off quickly, and flipping the field,” Burnip says.
  “If you can do those things, you’ll have a pretty successful career.” Hayball
  says he is “chasing perfection with every punt”. “Last year I did a good job
  getting it inside the 20, but this year I want more plays down inside the 10
  or five. Those can be gamechangers.” If Hayball wins the job and stays in New
  Orleans, he has one non-NFL goal: exploring the Louisiana swamps on an
  alligator sightseeing tour. “I know [Saints kicker Blake] Grupe is into that
  kind of stuff, so I might tag along next time he goes,” Hayball says. When
  asked if Americans might expect him to go full Steve Irwin and jump out of the
  boat and wrestle an alligator, he grins. “Nah, I couldn’t see myself doing
  that. Even though our crocs are way bigger in Australia, I still wouldn’t want
  to share the water with them.”
