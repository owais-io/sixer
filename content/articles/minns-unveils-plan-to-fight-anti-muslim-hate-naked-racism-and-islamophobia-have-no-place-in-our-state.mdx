  have no place in our state’

  The Minns government will establish a $1m program to combat anti-Muslim hate,
  including establishing a support hotline for victims and a program to build
  awareness of Islamophobia. The initiative will fund a support hotline for
  those experiencing Islamophobia and a case management system for victims of
  abuse so authorities and the community have better information about what
  behaviours are being experienced. The funds will also be used to build support
  services for people who are affected and to provide training programs to
  police responding to Islamophobic attacks. The grant comes after a huge
  turnout for a pro-Palestine march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. An
  estimated 225,000 to 300,000 people turned out. The march was opposed by the
  premier, Chris Minns, on public safety grounds but was permitted to go ahead
  after organisers successfully appealed to the supreme court. Minns’ stance
  caused internal dissent within the NSW Labor party, particularly among MPs
  whose seats have large Muslim populations, who saw Minns’ response as
  tone-deaf to the concerns of the community. “Anecdotal evidence presented to
  me indicates that Islamophobia is far higher than what is reported, we don’t
  want Australians suffering in silence or enduring racism without help or
  support,” Minns said as he announced the program. “Naked racism and
  Islamophobia have no place in our state or our country and it is abhorrent
  that people perpetuate this sort of behaviour,” he said. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The Action Against Islamophobia program, which will administer the
  grant, is run by the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC). The ANIC
  president, Imam Shadi Alsuleiman, said there had been a rise in anti-Muslim
  hate which had left many Muslims anxious about engaging in their daily
  religious activities, such as praying in mosques or leaving the house wearing
  the hijab. “Islamophobia manifests itself in the community in several
  different ways, and we’ve seen an increase in micro aggressions that are often
  brushed off as ignorance or rude behaviour. “Understanding how Muslims
  experience Islamophobia will help guide our approach to combating the issue on
  a holistic level.” The Scanlon Foundation’s most recent 2024 Mapping Social
  Cohesion report showed negative attitudes towards Muslims remain by far the
  highest towards any single faith group for more than 10 years. Negative
  attitudes towards Muslims rose from 27% in 2023 to 34% in 2024, according to
  the survey. The Islamophobia Register Australia has recorded a surge of over
  530% in Islamophobic incidents being reported since 7 October 2023 to July
  2025, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the body. “This program will play
  a critical role in providing support to those who have been affected by this
  hatred while also spreading awareness of the importance of rejecting racism in
  all its forms,” the minister for multiculturalism, Steve Kamper, said. “To
  safeguard our vibrant multiculturalism, we must ensure we’re putting the plans
  in place to stamp out hatred, like that faced by our Muslim community.” The
  NSW government has already taken steps to combat the rise in antisemitic
  incidents in NSW that escalated in the wake of the conflict in the Middle
  East. In February it passed controversial new laws cracking down on hate
  speech, offensive Nazi symbols, and desecration and harassment at places of
  worship. Minns said that these laws would protect not only Jewish people but
  members of all faiths and their places of worship. The Executive Council of
  Australian Jewry has reported that in the 12 months after 7 October 2023,
  there was a 316% increase in the overall number of reported antisemitic
  incidents in Australia compared with the same period in the previous year.
