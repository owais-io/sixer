  Top of the weekend to you all. If you need a side order of silly in your life,
  here’s something to add to your calendar before tucking into this week’s main
  course. 1. Tesla’s ‘retro-futuristic’ restaurant and charging station Elon
  Musk last week opened a Tesla-themed diner in Hollywood. What could possibly
  go wrong? As many things as you’d expect from a master of “move fast and break
  things”. Lois Beckett braved the lengthy queues, encountering tech glitches,
  unavailable menu items and a small flotilla of tricked-up Cybertrucks. Sales
  pitch: The Tesla boss said on an earnings call his diner was “a shiny beacon
  of hope in an otherwise sort-of bleak urban landscape”. It is located on Santa
  Monica Boulevard, in a neighbourhood full of high-end art galleries. How long
  will it take to read: Four minutes. 2. The life of microplastics If you’re not
  already furious about having microplastics in your semen/breast milk/unborn
  baby’s placenta, may I present to you a potential tipping point. This
  interactive tells the story of how plastic contaminates entire ecosystems –
  and even the food we eat. Fun fact: A single washing machine cycle can shed up
  to 700,000 tiny plastic fragments and threads. A single thread could voyage
  around the natural world for centuries. How long will it take to read: Three
  minutes. Further reading: How petrostates and well-funded lobbyists are
  derailing a deal to cut plastic production. 3. Jamie Lee Curtis lets rip on
  Hollywood’s age problem Jamie Lee Curtis’s energy fair bursts out of the
  screen in this interview with Emma Brockes. The conversation is a wild ride
  highlighted by the 66-year-old’s distaste for plastic surgery and Hollywood’s
  rejection of her movie-star parents, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, once they’d
  reached “a certain age”. *** “I’ve been very vocal about the genocide of a
  generation of women by the cosmeceutical industrial complex, who’ve disfigured
  themselves. The wax lips really sends it home.” – Curtis on why she brought a
  prop to the Guardian photoshoot. How long will it take to read: Nine minutes.
  4. Eight reasons to be hopeful Yes, the news cycle is unrelentingly grim, but
  John D Boswell is here to preach you some optimism. He reckons humans seem
  “largely blind to the many profound reasons for hope” – mostly because they
  are accumulating gradually and quietly. Medical miracles incoming: Says Barney
  Graham, an immunologist who played a pivotal role in developing mRNA vaccines:
  “You cannot imagine what you’re going to see over the next 30 years.” How long
  will it take to read: Four minutes. 5. More sex please, we’re bookish “Sex
  remains at the centre of much of the best fiction,” writes the author Lara
  Feigel, “and we need powerful fictions to show us what sex is or can become.”
  From Miranda July’s All Fours to the “romantasy” of Sarah J Maas, modern
  readers cannot get enough of sexually explicit novels – and Fiegel has some
  theories as to why. Sally Rooney says: “The erotic is a huge engine in the
  stories of all my books.” How long will it take to read: Five minutes. In case
  you missed it: Our interviews with Sally Rooney and Miranda July are worth
  revisiting. Sign up If you would like to receive these Five Great Reads to
