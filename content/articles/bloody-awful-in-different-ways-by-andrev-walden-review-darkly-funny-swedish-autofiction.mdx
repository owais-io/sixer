  For Mum (NB: not in a passive aggressive way)” reads the dedication at the
  beginning of this distinctive debut. It gives us a promising flavour of the
  voice with whom we’ll be spending the next 340 pages. The story begins with
  deceptive simplicity: “Once upon a time, I had seven dads in seven years. This
  is the story of those years.” The narrative has a section for each “dad”,
  charting Andrev’s tumultuous childhood and teens as his mother’s boyfriends
  come and go, all of them disappointing and disruptive, and several of them
  violent. The dads are named for their dominant trait in young Andrev’s eyes:
  so we get the Plant Magician, the Thief, the Murderer, the Artist, among
  others. It is billed as a novel but we’re in ambiguous territory here. The
  story is heavily autobiographical, based on Walden’s own childhood
  experiences. The narrator tells us: “If anything sounds made up, then you can
  be sure that it is true.” Instead, the inventions are “tucked away in the most
  mundane parts – like the colour of a cushion”. So we have two Andrevs
  involved, the child whose bewildered, coming-of-age adventures we follow, and
  the “real” Andrev, whose name is on the front cover. Metafictional
  interjections pepper the narrative, the authorial voice frequently intruding
  to comment on its own decisions, such as Andrev’s observation on the very
  first page: “I shouldn’t start there. (I have most assuredly already done so,
  but I think the attempt should remain, given its aptness as a bridge to a
  dramaturgical arc.)” These postmodern flourishes could have felt grating, but
  the narrative voice has more than enough wit and charm to carry them off. It’s
  easy to see why the book has been such a hit in Walden’s native Sweden, where
  it was the bestseller of 2023 across all genres and won the August prize,
  Sweden’s most prestigious literary award. Walden’s instinct for observation
  and his ear for prose are flawless. His understated humour is particularly
  winning. Going to stay with relatives, Andrev is amazed by the number of
  cousins in the house: “There are so many rooms and so many cousins that I keep
  finding new ones. It’s like opening doors on an Advent calendar – wow, here’s
  another cousin.” And then, a few pages later: “When we return to the apartment
  on Tomtebogatan, new cousins have emerged from the walls.” (He hasn’t yet
  realised that his aunt is a childminder.) But for all its humour, there is a
  terrible bleakness at the novel’s core. The men are, almost without exception,
  selfish, violent, dishonest or cruel; sometimes all of these at once. It is
  characteristic of Walden’s restraint that one of the most chilling moments in
  the novel is barely more than an aside, a reference to the friend of Andrev’s
  mother, Little Cloud, whose ex-boyfriend turned up at her door one night: “He
  didn’t want to talk. He didn’t even want to come in. All he wanted was to hit
  her on the head with the hammer and that he did, wordlessly. That’s how she
  got the hole in her head and learned to hate men.” The childish offhandness
  with which this moment is treated makes it all the more disturbing. Of all the
  dads, the brilliantly drawn Plant Magician looms largest in the narrative.
  Some of the others have a tendency to blur into one another (the book might
  also have been called Bloody Awful in Pretty Similar Ways). But it’s not
  really about the dads anyway. It’s about Andrev, and, to a lesser extent, his
  vulnerable and resilient mother. Beyond the structural device of the seven
  dads, Walden resists any easy narrative hooks; Andrev warns us not to “harbour
  expectations of an unexpected twist – this story lacks such inclinations”.
  Instead, Walden trusts to the precision and flair of his writing alone, and
  for the most part this decision is vindicated. It is true that the momentum
  dissipates somewhat in the final third (I could probably have done with one or
  two fewer dads, but since we’re in the realm of semifictionalised memoir, this
  is a bit much to ask). However, the writing remains so sharp, so beguiling, so
  acutely observed that by this point I was willing to follow Andrev/Andrev
  pretty much anywhere. • Rebecca Wait’s Havoc is published by Riverrun. •
  Bloody Awful in Different Ways by Andrev Walden, translated by Ian Giles, is
  published by Fig Tree (£14.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy at
