  CMAT: Euro-Country review – deeply relatable, gloriously catchy Celtic pop
  from a true one-off

  She may unite two of the mid-2020s most pervasive cultural trends – the
  so-called “green wave” of zeitgeist-dominating Irish actors, authors and
  musicians; and the irreverent embrace of country music by pop stars such as
  Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey and Chappell Roan – but you don’t need to spend much
  time in the company of 29-year-old Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson to realise she’s
  a total one-off. Who else would come out with a chugging indie earworm called
  The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, in which an irrational hatred of the
  celebrity chef and his Shell deli franchise (“That man should not have his
  face on posters!”) leads her to grasp frantically at slippery observations
  about social anxiety and her own aesthetic sensibilities? Even the most
  conventional song on Euro-Country, the cool R&amp;B-pop of Running/Planning,
  is laden with bonkers lyrics about creating an imaginary boyfriend, ripping
  his head off and then promising to buy said head a Nintendo and “all the
  games”. Thompson – who won instant acclaim in Ireland with her 2022 debut If
  My Wife New I’d Be Dead, and cemented her status in the UK with its
  Mercury-nominated follow-up Crazymad, for Me – is not kooky in the manic pixie
  dream girl sense, or leftfield in an alienating radical way. Instead, she is
  deeply relatable in her weirdness. On the saccharine soul of Take a Sexy
  Picture of Me, she captures the formative nature of toxic femininity by
  recounting an attempt to wax her legs with tape aged nine, while on Ready
  she’s mired in the message – pedalled by Gwyneth et al – that women must
  engage in infinite self-perfection at the expense of actual living. In
  Coronation St, waiting for her life to start, over strummed guitar, she feels
  like a soap barmaid with no lines. In fact, Corrie gets more than one
  shout-out on her third album, which is enriched by a jumble of cultural
  references – Dorian Gray, Veruca Salt, Calpol, Kerry Katona – both a sign of
  camp humour and a voracious mind seeking to explain and evoke thoughts that
  exist just beyond the fringes of everyday conversation. One of these emotional
  landscapes is also geographical: among Euro-Country’s major preoccupations is
  Thompson’s complicated feelings towards her homeland. Combining mundane
  regional commerce and gaudy, chintzy folk art, the album cover prods at
  Ireland’s mystical reputation by depicting the musician stepping out of a town
  centre fountain in hyper-saturated colour. But then she’s engaging in droll
  romanticism of her own on opener Billy Byrne from Ballybrack, the Leader of
  the Pigeon Convoy, which applies an echoey filter and gently building synth
  backdrop to a recording of a man discussing wind conditions, suffusing his
  words with a soporific warmth that is at once familiar and otherworldly. One
  song later, on the title track and inarguable peak, Thompson is fusing a
  potted history of the country’s economic woes (“I was 12 when the das started
  killing themselves all around me”) with sour reminiscences about her own
  stultifying adolescence in County Meath (“All the mooching ’round shops, and
  the lack of identity”), all of it relayed in a mixture of beautiful, vaguely
  yodelly tones, Lana-esque melancholia and chipmunk backing vocals that recall
  Norwich experimentalists Let’s Eat Grandma. And it’s funny. And it’s catchy.
  “I waited for love / With a cricket bat,” begins When a Good Man Cries, a
  gorgeous dirge that tempers brash fiddle and strains of cheesy 90s country-pop
  with sublime Fleetwood Mac-style harmonies. Miraculously, Euro-Country’s
  distinctive lyrics never upstage the music, which is often subtle but just as
  fastidiously inventive – from Janis Joplining’s maximalist blues to Tree Six
  Foive’s propulsive goth-folk – and always a great showcase for Thompson’s
  lovely voice. Still, Euro-Country is exceptional because of how Thompson
  constantly strives – sometimes wryly, sometimes earnestly, always
  entertainingly – to capture messy psychological entrails that don’t fit the
  template of the typical pop song. Pared-back indie number Lord, Let That Tesla
  Crash is a tribute to an old housemate who died, but any threat of mindless
  sentimentality is instantly eviscerated as Thompson admits: “I don’t miss you
  like I should.” Her grief is tangled with emotional avoidance and
  unreciprocated affection (a recurring theme); her pain sublimated into fury
  directed at the Tesla owner who has parked outside their old home. It’s
  classic CMAT: a roiling sea of charm, chaos, substance, sadness and piercing
  insight – and yet more proof this nascent star is in a class of her own.
