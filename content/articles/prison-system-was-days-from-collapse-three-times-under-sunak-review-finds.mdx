  The criminal justice system in England and Wales was within days of collapse
  on three occasions before being bailed out by “last-minute emergency
  measures”, an independent review by a former prisons watchdog has found. Dame
  Anne Owers said the prison system, under pressure from overcrowding, was “in
  crisis” between autumn 2023 and the summer of 2024, but No 10 under Rishi
  Sunak refused to cut the numbers in jail until “the next predictable cliff
  edge”. Former ministers and officials interviewed by Owers “expressed
  frustration and sometimes anger” at the failure to endorse a plan to avert
  crises and suspected that this was a deliberate move by Downing Street, she
  said. “Many believed that the default position was to do as little as possible
  as late as possible, with the consequence that the system repeatedly reached
  the brink of collapse,” she said. The 25-page report into the teetering Prison
  Service, which remains at nearly 97.5% capacity, comes as the criminal justice
  system is expected to come under renewed pressure this weekend. Police have
  warned that they could arrest hundreds of people who plan to express support
  for Palestine Action on Saturday. Forces fear more incidents among people
  protesting outside hotels housing asylum seekers across Greater London, the
  north-east of England and East Anglia. The review, commissioned by the justice
  secretary, Shabana Mahmood, in February, detailed claims that Sunak’s office
  waited until prisons were days from collapsing before acting – to the dismay
  of some ministers. “Although departmental ministers were convinced by mid-2023
  that some form of early release was both necessary and urgent, this required
  prime ministerial agreement, which was not forthcoming until the system was
  within three days of potential collapse, and only in incremental stages,” she
  wrote. She said Alex Chalk, the then justice secretary, called for an early
  release scheme from mid-2023 for prisoners who had received standard
  determinate sentences, but received no backing. Chalk had made clear, she
  said, that he “was advocating, without success, a version of the SDS early
  release scheme in order to get ahead of the crisis, rather than the minimal
  salami-slicing approach that was eventually taken”. “Without exception, all
  those the review spoke to expressed frustration and sometimes anger at the
  reluctance to accept and then act on the well-documented and imminent crisis,
  or to agree any coherent plan to avert it,” she wrote. After the general
  election was called in May 2024, Sunak called emergency Cobra meetings to
  discuss “invoking emergency powers” to release prisoners early if the criminal
  justice system collapsed. “This might be necessary to avert the risk of public
  disorder if the criminal justice system collapsed during the election
  campaign,” the report disclosed. On three occasions, the Sunak government used
  early release schemes, employing powers designed to allow release on
  compassionate grounds, the report said. Civil servants were concerned that
  there would be an investigation into the mismanagement of prisons, the report
  said. “Senior officials were so concerned about a potential breakdown in the
  criminal justice system that an audit was kept of all decision-making and
  documents, in case there was a public or parliamentary inquiry,” the report
  found. In October 2023, Chalk announced plans to free prisoners 18 days early
  under the end of custody supervised licence, which was later extended to 35
  days and then 70 days. More than 13,000 were released under the scheme. One of
  Labour’s first acts after forming a government last year was to announce a
  plan to release offenders with standard determinate sentences after they had
  served 40% of their term. Recommendations from David Gauke’s sentencing
  review, which proposed less jail time for thousands of offenders, including
  some violent criminals and domestic abusers, are in the process of being
  implemented. Commenting on the Owers report, Mahmood said it “lays bare the
  disgraceful way the last Conservative government ran our prisons. They added
  less than 500 cells to the prison estate over 14 years, released over 10,000
  prisoners early under a veil of secrecy, and brought our jails close to total
  collapse on countless occasions.” The Conservatives and Sunak have been
  approached for comment. Andrew Neilson, the director of campaigns at the
  Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “This review into prison capacity spells
  out in forensic detail how the government has found itself facing the prospect
  of running out of cells. It is a crisis, or more accurately a series of
  crises, that has been brewing over several decades and across successive
  governments.”
