  In simpler times, everyone slept on sprung beds. A few rebels opted for futons
  (or even waterbeds), but back in the 20th century, most of us had mattresses
  with tufted surfaces and a belly full of springs that bounced when you jumped
  on them. Memory foam began sneaking into our beds in the 90s, ushering in a
  brave new world of cushioned peace. Most of the products I’ve considered for
  the Filter’s best mattresses roundup contain memory foam layers to boost
  comfort and limit bounce. But traditional sprung beds remain unstoppably
  popular, and one example – the Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 – is a bestseller at
  Mattress Online. I slept on the Millbrook during some of the hottest weeks of
  the summer, that annual ordeal of fruit flies and night sweats. Memory foam is
  notorious for trapping heat, so this seemed a good time to find out whether
  Millbrook’s old-fashioned breathable design could help me stay cool and get a
  decent sleep. View at Mattress Online View at B&amp;Q *** How I tested I was
  sent a double-size Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 in early May, when the days were
  warm but the nights reassuringly cool. My family testing panel came over to
  rate it out of 10 for firmness and comfort when it was fresh from its
  wrapping. They also helped me run lab-style experiments with heat pads,
  weights and wobbly cups of water to measure its sinkage, motion isolation,
  heat retention and edge support. My husband, Alan, and I slept on the
  Millbrook for six weeks until late June. By then, the heatwave had descended,
  and Alan had moved to the spare room. (Don’t judge. When it’s 28C in your
  bedroom at night, the last thing it needs is another human.) This gave me a
  chance to test the mattress as a solo sleeper on some of the muggiest nights
  of the year. *** What you need to know, from price to firmness View at
  Mattress Online View at B&amp;Q The Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 is affordable
  for a pocket-sprung mattress of such hefty construction. Its RRP is high
  (£1,214.63 for a double), but Millbrook sells this mattress only through
  third-party retailers, which normally knock off hundreds of pounds. Mattress
  Online has the double for £615.94, while B&amp;Q was asking for £620 at the
  time of writing. Mattress Online’s prices range from £453.57 for a single to
  £1,146.20 for the superking zip and link. The Luxury 4000 sits in the middle
  of Millbrook’s range of pocket-sprung mattresses, both in terms of price and
  spring count. The most affordable is the Wool Ortho 1000 (£415.20 for a
  double) and the most luxurious is the Supreme Collection 11,000 (£1,899),
  which has more than 10 times the number of springs of its cheapest cousin.
  There are actually 5,000 springs in the Luxury 4000: one layer of 1,000 large
  pocket springs between two layers of 2,000 “Comfonomic” micro springs that add
  bounce and help offset the firmness of the pocket springs. Most pocket-sprung
  mattresses, even the budget Ikea Valevåg, use other materials to cushion the
  springs. That doesn’t make them hybrids (“hybrid” usually means a mattress
  that contains memory foam, gel or latex as well as springs), but it does make
  them more sophisticated than the cheap fabric-wrapped boxes of springs that
  you may have slept on as a child. The Millbrook contains 11 layers in all,
  including cotton, silk, “cashgora” – from cross-breeding cashmere and angora
  goats – and wool sourced from Millbrook’s Hampshire locale. The viscose-cotton
  cover is tufted with Hampshire wool, and one of the tufts is black to
  represent a black sheep – a lovely touch. The edges are stitched and
  reinforced with a metal rod for extra support, so you can’t remove the cover
  to stick it in the washing machine as you can with the Otty Original Hybrid or
  the Simba Hybrid Pro. The mattress is double-sided and needs regular turning
  to avoid dents where you sleep. Full disclosure: Alan and I left it more than
  two weeks before we flipped the mattress in exasperation at the dents we’d
  created – and only then realised we should have been turning it once a week
  for the first month. This is a more frequent flip recommendation than many
  mattresses, and also unfortunate, because the Millbrook is an absolute beast
  to manoeuvre. At 28cm deep and a thumping 65kg for the double, this behemoth
  is one of the heaviest mattresses I’ve ever tested. Even Millbrook suggests
  that you “seek assistance” when turning it, so bad luck if you live alone. At
  least you’re helped by having two turn handles on each end as well as along
  each side. Millbrook describes the Luxury 4000 as “medium to firm”. This was
  accurate initially, but it’s no more than medium once you’ve slept on it for a
  few weeks. Before sleep-testing, my family scored it 8/10 for firmness, and it
  sank a maximum of 19mm under 7.5kg of weight. After one month, it scored 7/10
  and sank 35mm. This is within the 40mm “acceptable settlement” specified by
  Millbrook and is caused by the compression of fibre layers. You get a 10-year
  warranty, although you’ll have to register your mattress within 60 days of
  purchase to benefit from it. Mattress Online also offers a 60-night trial,
  during which you can return it for an exchange if you don’t get on with it.

  The Millbrook was the first mattress I’ve tested that arrived mattress-shaped,
  rather than vacuum-shrunk into a plastic-wrapped sausage. It was shipped by
  Mattress Online and delivered the next day by AIT, whose drivers offered to
  carry it to any room but left it in the hallway as requested. I should’ve
  taken them up on the offer. Alan and I got it upstairs with some difficulty
  (Alan was literally doing all the heavy lifting there). We found it relatively
  easy to unpack thanks to the absence of shrink-wrap polyurethane, although
  there was still plenty of plastic sheeting to take to the dump. The Millbrook
  was ready to test and sleep on immediately, and there was none of the chemical
  “off-gassing” smell that I’ve experienced with memory foam hybrid mattresses.
  *** What we love The Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 was Goldilocks-perfect at
  first, neither too firm nor too soft. Its upper layers yielded quite a bit
  over the weeks, and I was less disappointed than my husband about this: I
  liked the way it cradled my hips, knees and shoulders when I slept on my side.
  If you live with joint pain, you’ll welcome the pressure relief. Night sweats
  weren’t completely avoidable, because no mattress can actively cool you down
  on a sweltering night – it can just avoid trapping your heat. The Millbrook
  genuinely helped me dial down the sogginess, but couldn’t stop it completely.
  I’ll be interested to see if its temperature-regulating powers help in winter,
  too, when I’ll be seeking warmth rather than trying to escape it. After Alan
  left for the solitary cool of the spare room, I often found myself switching
  to his vacant side of the bed halfway through the night. Not only was it
  drier, but it also felt firmer, because the fabric layers had decompressed and
  regained their full size. This would help to explain why the mattress benefits
  from such frequent turning. The compression of the layers never felt like
  sagging, in the way that memory foam can. The Millbrook’s edge support is the
  best of any mattress I’ve tested. The edges are so robust that they sink
  significantly less under weights than the middle of the mattress does; about
  1cm less under 7.5kg of hand weights. The edges lost no height at all after
  we’d slept on the Millbrook for a few weeks, either. As well as making it easy
  to get in and out of bed, this strong edge support suggests that the Luxury
  4000 has the durability to last many years. *** What we don’t love The comfort
  layers gave the Millbrook slightly better motion isolation than the Ikea
  Valevåg, but it’s still no match for memory foam when it comes to absorbing
  the bounce of springs. Its hilly surface made it difficult to test motion
  isolation with a glass of water, but test it we did – and the results were
  messy enough to confirm our suspicions that our tossing and turning was more
  noticeable than on a hybrid. Even though I like a bit of cushioning, I felt
  slightly cheated when the initially firm surface gradually smushed beneath me
  – I could see and feel the indentation where my body had been lying. The
  surface decompressed quickly when not being slept on, which I liked, but
  that’s not much help when you’re craving more pushback in the middle of the
  night. I didn’t feel much benefit from the Millbrook’s “ErgoZone 7” zoned
  layout, which uses thicker-gauge wires for firmer support under your hips,
  head and feet. This may be because I’m barely 5ft (152cm) on tiptoes, and the
  world and its mattresses tend to be designed for adult men. But then Alan –
  5ft 10in (178cm) and average weight – didn’t seem able to find the firm zones
  either. *** Sustainability Memory foam is one of the least sustainable
  materials used in furnishings, and its absence here gives the Millbrook the
  best environmental credentials of any mattress I’ve reviewed. Even the
  simplest pocket-sprung mattresses usually contain synthetic material, such as
  the polyfoam in the Ikea Valevåg. Millbrook’s decision to use only natural,
  biodegradable fibres for its soft covers and fillings adds to the price, but
  has considerable benefits in sustainability and durability. Millbrook Beds’
  Sustainable Sleep page is full of information about its materials and
  practices. Neither wool nor cashgora is vegan, but Millbrook sources the wool
  locally in Hampshire. The mattress’s cotton content involves a more
  emission-heavy journey because it’s grown in the US, but it is at least
  natural, renewable and biodegradable. All Millbrook mattresses are treated to
  meet flame-retardant standards using “a fully biological solution”. This has
  helped the company earn certification by sustainability bodies Planet Mark and
  Sedex. *** Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000: should I buy it? Buy this mattress if
  you love the breathability of a pocket-sprung bed – and sleep well knowing
  that it’s more environmentally friendly than a memory foam hybrid. The
  Millbrook doesn’t retain heat in the way that foam can, and its wool layers
  can help regulate your body’s temperature through the sweaty and shivery
  excesses of summer and winter. Just be aware that it may feel too soft if you
  like your beds on the orthopaedic side, and its weekly turning requirements
  will be a real challenge if you live alone. View at Mattress Online View at
