  rules, in a significant expansion of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. The
  state department said that all of the foreigners who now hold valid US visas
  are subject to “continuous vetting” for any indication that they could be

  country. Should such evidence come to light, the visa would be revoked and, if
  the visa holder were in the United States, they would be subject to
  deportation. Here are the key stories at a glance. Trump administration to
  review 55m US visa holders for potential rule violations Trump officials will

  including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting
  to live in the United States. “The state department revokes visas any time
  there are indications of a potential ineligibility, which includes things like
  any indicators of overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety,
  engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a
  terrorist organization,” a department spokesperson said. Read the full story
