  It was a stirring speech that brought Democrats to tears. “When someone is
  cruel or acts like a bully, you don’t stoop to their level,” Michelle Obama
  told them in Philadelphia in 2016. “No, our motto is: ‘When they go low, we go
  high.’” Fast forward to Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National
  Committee, speaking in Chicago this week. “This is not the Democratic party of
  your grandfather, which would bring a pencil to the knife fight,” he insisted.
  “This is a new Democratic party. We’re bringing a knife to a knife fight, and
  we are going to fight fire with fire.” It was a brutally honest
  acknowledgement of what a decade of Donald Trump’s politics has wrought. Out
  go the courtly and courteous playing-by-the-rules Democrats convinced that
  Maga is a passing phase, a fever that will break. In come a new generation of
  pugnacious Democrats prepared to take off the gloves and fight dirty. The
  trigger for this scorched-earth approach is Trump’s push to find more
  Republican seats in the House of Representatives ahead of next year’s crucial
  midterm elections through gerrymandering, a process of manipulating electoral
  maps to benefit one party over another. At the president’s urging, Texas
  Republicans have proposed new congressional districts aimed at flipping five
  Democratic-held seats, diluting the voting power of millions of people of
  colour and further skewing an already deeply partisan map in that state. Trump
  also dispatched his vice-president, JD Vance, to Indiana to discuss
  redistricting with the state governor and legislative leaders in the hope of
  gaining one or two Republican seats. Separately, a top Republican leader in
  Florida announced plans to begin redistricting efforts in the president’s
  adopted home state. After months of inertia and disunity in response to Trump,
  Democrats are now finding their voice and taking a stand. Democratic state
  legislators from Texas fled their home state to deny Republicans a quorum and
  prevent a vote on the proposed new map. Democratic governors floated the
  possibility of rushing to redraw their own state maps in retaliation, even if
  their options are limited. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, wants
  Democratic gerrymandering in his state if Texas proceeds, though voters would
  have to bypass an independent redistricting commission. Newsom said: “Donald
  Trump is trying to steal the 2026 election. We cannot sit back and watch this
  happen.” Illinois governor JB Pritzker and New York governor Kathy Hochul have
  also declared their intent to push redistricting to neutralize Republican
  map-rigging. Pritzker denounced Trump as a “cheater” and said: “As far as I’m
  concerned, everything is on the table.” Standing with six Texas Democrats who
  sought refuge in New York, Hochul told reporters: “I’m tired of fighting this
  fight with my hand tied behind my back. We are at war and that’s why the
  gloves are off – and I say bring it on.” They have the backing of prominent
  party figures such as Eric Holder, a former attorney general under President
  Barack Obama. Holder, whose organisation has long campaigned to end
  gerrymandering, admitted this week that he has changed his position and now
  believes that Democrats should respond with their own redistricting. Holder
  told the New York Times: “What’s driving Democrats is, I think, a legitimate
  response. I mean, it’s like the Germans have invaded France. Are you going to
  just say, “Well, we’re against war and we’re for the resolution of disputes in
  a peaceful way”? Sometimes you have to take up arms. And when confronted with
  this authoritarian, anti-democracy effort, we have to take up arms.” The view
  is shared by another lifelong proponent of independent redistricting
  commissions. Norm Eisen, a lawyer and co-founder of Democracy Defenders
  Action, a nonpartisan group dedicated to free and fair elections, said: “It’s
  said you should never bring a knife to a gunfight. My view is that you should
  bring a bazooka to a gunfight. “I believe we have no choice now but to respond
  with massive pro-democracy force to these autocratic manoeuvres by Trump and
  his enablers in Texas. I favour every Democratic state that has the power to
  do it maximizing the number of districts. If Texas blinks, they can back off
  as well.” A mid-decade redistricting arms race makes some observers uneasy.
  They fear that Democrats will sacrifice the moral high ground by using
  anti-democratic measures in the name of democracy, evoking a statement often
  attributed to a US army major during the Vietnam war: “It became necessary to
  destroy the town to save it.” Eisen acknowledges the “tremendous danger” of a
  race to the bottom. But he added: “If we spend time wringing our hands about
  that we may find we’ve lost our democracy while we tarried. The continuity of
  American democracy may depend on blue states responding with alacrity to what
  Trump and Texas have started. Democracy won’t survive that kind of asymmetry.”
  Few Democrats personify the new bareknuckle approach better than Jasmine
  Crockett, who was among the leaders the last time Texas Democrats left the
  state to thwart Republicans in 2021. They stayed away for 38 days, although
  the Republican-led elections bill and voting restrictions eventually passed.
  Now a congresswoman in Washington, Crockett argues that such tactics remain
  effective. “If it’s waking up the conscience of this country about why this is
  a terrible practice, then that is a win,” she told the Guardian in a phone
  interview this week. “If it is showing those who decided to stay on the couch
  during the last presidential there are Democrats that are willing and ready to
  fight – but you just got to give us a shot.” Republicans have responded more
  aggressively to Texas Democrats’ efforts to stall procedure than they did four
  years ago. Senator John Cornyn said the FBI has agreed to help track down the
  Texas Democrats. Governor Greg Abbott said he is taking legal action to remove
  dozens of them from office. Crockett believes the authoritarian threat is now
  so severe that Democrats must stand and fight. “They have taken our kindness
  for weakness,” she said. “Democrats are very much wanting to be fair. “That is
  why you don’t find independent redistricting committees in Republican states;
  you find them in Democratic states. How can we fight when we tie our own hands
  behind our backs? It is so bad right now that we’ve got to do whatever we can
  to try to even the playing field somewhat.” She added: “Democracy is currently
  hanging by a thread at this point. We’ve got one team that’s playing chess and
  another one that’s playing checkers. We got to play the same game.
  Unfortunately we have endured a lot of harm and there’s a lot of systems that
  have been broken in only the first seven months of this administration.”
  Democrats have long been accused of timidity, showing more concern about being
  right than about being in power, eschewing vicious attacks on opponents with
  the notable exception of their own left wing. Joe Biden, then 78, sought to
  use his presidency to build bridges, restore bipartisanship and the soul of
  America. Crockett, 44, represents a new generation of smash-mouth politicians
  ready for verbal combat. Last year her denunciation of Republican Marjorie
  Taylor Greene’s “bleach blonde bad-built butch body” at a congressional
  hearing became a meme. Last weekend she told a conference that Trump is “a
  piece of shit”, earning raucous cheers from her audience. Crockett believes
  that the Democratic base is crying out for the party to be more bold-faced.
  “People are OK with you not having all the answers, but I don’t think that
  people are OK with you not being willing to fight on their behalf. When you
  sign up to be an elected representative on any level they expect you to be
  their voice. “We’ve had this kind of over-pronouncement of Republican voices
  because they do whatever they want and then we’re just letting it happen.
  People are saying, ‘What is the point? I can never vote for the Republicans
  but what are you going to do?’ “It is about rebuilding that rapport and trust
  with our base and letting them know that we will be the fighters that they
  need – not only doing it in response, but we’ve actually got to be proactive.”
  Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, has also been pursuing a
  gloves-off approach. He called Trump a “stone cold liar”, sued him for
  illegally federalising the national guard and, when threatened with arrest by
  border czar Tom Homan, retorted: “Arrest me. Let’s get it over with, tough
  guy.” Newsom filed a $787m defamation lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the
  network of falsely claiming he lied about a phone call with Trump in June.
  Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, said: “You’re seeing that the era of
  the Clintons and the Pelosis and the Bidens are yielding now to a new era of
  Democratic leaders. JB Pritzker’s emerged, Gavin’s emerged, Jasmine Crockett’s
  emerged. You’re seeing new voices emerge in this scrum, as you would expect in
  a democracy. There isn’t one person in charge.” Even as they do battle in a
  more aggressive manner, Rosenberg argues, Democrats are obliged to make clear
  the values they striving to defend. “We’re in a fight for the future of our
  country and for our democracy,” he said. “We have to now operate out of
  patriotism and love of country and allow that to be our our north star and our
  guiding force through all of this. “Not fighting means that you’re conceding
  and that you’re obeying in advance. In this case, this is where we decide to
  draw a line. We have to now go fight in this and go win it.”
