  A distinct farmyard smell lingers near the muddy Sheep Paintings. People walk
  slowly between two dense hedges of windfallen oak branches, or stand silently
  in a fragile cage of bulrush stems with light seeping through the mossy
  skylight overhead. I’m visiting the largest ever indoor exhibition of work by
  Andy Goldsworthy, one of Britain’s most influential nature artists. His recent
  installations have a visceral sense of rural landscape: hare’s blood on paper,
  sheep shit on canvas, rusty barbed wire, stained wool, cracked clay. The show
  is a sensory celebration of earth – its textures and temperatures, colours,
  character. The seasons cycle through an ongoing multidecade series of photos
  featuring the same fallen elm. There are leaf patterns and delicate woven
  branches, crusts of snow, lines of summer foxglove flowers or autumn rosehips.
  Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty Years is a National Galleries of Scotland (NGS)
  exhibition in the neoclassical Royal Scottish Academy building. After the
  exhibition, as a sort of cultural pilgrimage, I’m walking six miles across
  Edinburgh in search of works by the Dumfriesshire-based Goldsworthy and other
  artists who engage with the landscape. I start at the Royal Botanic Garden
  (free and open daily, rbge.org.uk), a short bus ride north of the National
  Gallery. Just inside the east gate, there’s a perforated sculpture by Barbara
  Hepworth with sunlight pouring through it. “Art has made me look at the world
  … and engage with what’s around me,” Goldsworthy writes in the notes for Fifty
  Years. Walking up through shady beeches, blazing wildflowers and scented,
  bee-buzzing lavender, there’s a bronze girl in a waterlily pond, and a sundial
  by the Scottish artist and writer Ian Hamilton Finlay near the terrace cafe.
  Finlay’s best-known artwork is the garden he created with his wife, Sue, in
  the wild Pentland Hills (£15 over-16s, £10 for 10-15s, under-10s free, open
  Thursday to Sunday until 28 September, littlesparta.org.uk). He also built a
  stone temple in the rolling, wooded acres of Jupiter Artland, a few miles from
  Edinburgh, where Goldsworthy has put rocks in trees and trees in a
  stone-walled barn (£11.80 adults, £7.50 children). Celebrating both artists,
  Jupiter’s exhibition Work Begat Work runs until 28 September. In the Royal
  Botanic Garden, Goldsworthy’s Slate Cone stands next to Inverleith House,
  where the gallery is showing feminist photomontages by Linder (free, until 19
  October), who opened this year’s Edinburgh art festival (until 24 August).
  Enlarged images from her work (smiling mouths, bees, lilies) are dotted among
  ponds and flowerbeds. Goldsworthy’s Slate, Hole, Wall, a round enclosure of
  stacked grey stones, stands in the gardens’ south-east corner, under a weeping
  silver lime tree sweet with honey-fragrant blossom. The Water of Leith Walkway
  runs close to the John Hope Gateway on Arboretum Place, and I follow it
  south-westwards. In Stockbridge, the Sunday market, shaded by whitebeam trees,
  offers loaves of artisanal bread, Perthshire strawberries and cakes made from
  insects. Almost hidden in branches under a bridge, a lifesize cast-iron figure
  stands in the river nearby, one of Antony Gormley’s 6 Times statues. Another
  of the figures is buried chest-deep by the zebra crossing between National
  Galleries Scotland: Modern One and Two. Wandering past domed St Bernard’s
  Well, with its statue of the goddess of health, and picturesque Dean Village,
  crammed with fellow camera-wielding visitors, I detour to the Modern galleries
  up the riverside steps. Linking both museums is Charles Jencks’ huge Landform,
  with its grassy hills and curving pond. There are days’ worth of galleries,
  artists’ rooms and sculpture gardens to explore here, but the afternoon is
  passing and I have more miles and museums to cover. Heading back along the
  leafy Water of Leith, I climb another steep flight of steps towards Haymarket.
  On the south lawn of St Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral, a labyrinth winds through
  aromatic yarrow and knapweed. Around this flowering meadow, as part of an
  installation called On Sacred Ground, there are rough benches elegiacally
  listing threatened Scottish species: corncrake, hawfinch, wryneck, ring ouzel,
  capercaillie. I walk on through Princes Street Gardens, back past the Royal
  Academy building, and drop into the National Gallery (free) next door to see
  Van Gogh’s impasto Olive Trees and William McTaggart’s stormy seascapes. Up
  more steps, pausing to look back at distant views of the firth, and then down
  again across photogenic Victoria Street. Finally, I stroll through Greyfriars
  Kirkyard to reach the National Museum of Scotland (free, nms.ac.uk). In 1998,
  Goldsworthy installed four sunset-coloured blocks of split sandstone on the
  museum roof, with its panoramic city views. But the blue skies have turned
  stormy. “Our roof terrace is closed today – the weather is too dreich!” says a
  red sign by the lift. Instead, I head to the basement, where more late-1990s
  works by Goldsworthy complement a brilliant gallery about Scotland’s early
  inhabitants. There’s Hearth, a burned circle on a platform of salvaged wood
  from the museum’s construction site. Stacked Whalebones is a pale ball of
  interlocking bones, the whole skeleton of a five-metre pilot whale found
  beached in Northumberland. Around golden bronze age torcs and silver Viking
  arm-rings, Roman carvings and flint arrowheads, the artist also designed
  Enclosure, two curving walls of reworked Edinburgh slates. Another backdrop is
  of stained Dumfriesshire clay like the Red Wall in the Fifty Years exhibition.
  Outside, the Edinburgh fringe is in full swing (until 25 August). Among the
  crowds are buskers, jugglers, unicyclists. With just one night to sample its
  anarchic offerings, I plunge into dodgy cabarets and sweaty comedies in tiny
  underventilated venues. At 9pm, I’m back at the National Museum for an
  accomplished Lloyd-Webber-esque musical about Van Gogh. Towards midnight, I
  head to Summerhall for a strange, polyphonic prequel to Hamlet by the Polish
  choral-theatre group Song of the Goat. The next day, as I walk to Edinburgh’s
  Waverley station, there’s a prismatic haze caught between the misty drizzle
  and breezy summer sun. It reminds me of Goldsworthy’s 1980s photo series with
  titles like Rainbow Splash Hit Water With Heavy Stick Bright, Sunny, Windy. As
  the train speeds south, through Northumberland and North Yorkshire, I see with
  new eyes the wave-pounded cliffs and bale-studded headlands, the dry-stone
  walls and sheep-scattered patchwork dales. The trip was provided by Visit
  Scotland, NGS and LNER, (York to Edinburgh from £23 each way, London to
  Edinburgh from £52). Andy Goldsworthy 50 Years runs until 2 November, (£19
  adults, £5 children, nationalgalleries.org)
