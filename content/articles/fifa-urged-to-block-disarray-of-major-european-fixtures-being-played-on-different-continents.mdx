  different continents

  Fifa has been urged by leading supporters’ groups to block domestic league
  matches from being played abroad and avoid “a Pandora’s box of disarray for
  football”, as the prospect of major European fixtures taking place on
  different continents looms large. World football’s governing body is likely to
  be tasked with deciding whether Villarreal face Barcelona in Miami in December
  after La Liga’s request to make the switch was approved and submitted by the
  Spanish football federation. Milan and Como are also looking to play a Serie A
  fixture in Perth, Western Australia, in February. Signing off those moves
  would, the fan bodies have warned, mean “setting a dangerous precedent” and
  “stripping clubs of their roots”. Those fears were expressed by Football
  Supporters Europe, the Independent Supporters Council, Football Supporters
  Association Australia and Accionistas y Socios del Fútbol Español in a letter
  sent last week to the Fifa secretary general, Mattias Grafström. They
  explained moving games abroad would undermine sporting integrity, unbalancing
  the regular home-and-away rhythm, while “reducing clubs to entertainment
  products detached from their tradition and communities”. The letter pointed
  out that local supporters would be alienated and the clubs’ cultural
  identities would be reduced; it also stressed the environmental cost and
  logistical burden of the associated long-haul travel. “Relocating domestic
  league matches abroad would set a dangerous precedent, stripping clubs of
  their roots and undermining the trust of supporters,” said Ronan Evain, the
  executive director of Football Supporters Europe. “Fifa must take a clear
  stand to protect the integrity and identity of domestic football. “Those
  behind the proposals claim they are only interested in a one-off event, a
  claim we reject. If permitted, this would open a Pandora’s box of disarray for
  football. Shortsighted commercial interests cannot take precedent over
  protecting domestic football and the communities our clubs grew out of.” The
  signatories noted that Fifa would be directly contravening its own regulations
  governing international matches, specifically those requiring domestic games
  to be played in the territory of their national association, if it gave the
  green light. In October last year Fifa set up a working group to review those
  rules but any outcomes are yet to be communicated. As the Guardian reported
  last week, Uefa’s executive committee will discuss next Thursday whether to
  give its own approval and in what form. Uefa, US Soccer and Concacaf must all
  accept the proposals before Fifa has the final say. Despite misgivings among
  Uefa leadership – voiced publicly by its president, Aleksander Ceferin – the
  push to move big-ticket matches to new markets has significant momentum.
  Potential legal arguments against it have lost weight since the US-based
  promoter Relevent Sports, which became Uefa’s worldwide marketing and sales
  partner this year, agreed a settlement in April 2024 that dismissed Fifa from
  a lawsuit challenging its policy of barring league games from being staged in
  other countries. The Premier League, which proposed an extra foreign-based
  “39th game” round in 2008 but shelved the idea amid widespread opposition, has
  no plans to join La Liga and Serie A in seeking to relocate matches.
