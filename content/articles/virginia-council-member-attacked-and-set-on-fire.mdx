  A councilman in Danville, Virginia, was attacked and set on fire on Wednesday
  over what police are describing as a “personal matter” not related to his
  position or politics. According to a statement released by the Danville police
  department, the councilman, Lee Vogler, 38, was attacked at the offices of a
  local magazine, where he is also employed. The police said officers were
  dispatched at about 11.30am after receiving a report that a man had been set
  on fire. Witnesses told police that the suspect “entered into the victim’s
  place of employment, confronted him and doused him with a flammable liquid”.
  Then, witnesses said Vogler and the suspect “exited the building, where the
  suspect then set the victim on fire”. The suspect then reportedly fled the
  scene, and witnesses provided a description of the suspect and his vehicle to
  the responding officers. Police said officers located and stopped the vehicle
  several blocks from the incident, and the driver was taken into custody. The
  driver, identified by the police as Shotsie Michael Buck Hayes, 29, of
  Danville, was identified as the suspect in the attack. In the statement, the
  police said: “Based on the investigation at the time of this release, the
  victim and the suspect are known to each other and the attack stems from a
  personal matter not related to the victim’s position on Danville city council
  or any other political affiliation.” The full extent of Vogler’s injuries were
  not known, the police said on Wednesday afternoon. The Danville fire
  department and the Danville Life Saving Crew also responded to the scene to
  render aid, police said. Vogler was airlifted to a regional medical facility
  for treatment. The police department added that “due to the ongoing
  investigation, the Danville police department will not provide any further
  details about the incident itself. However, charge information will be
  forthcoming.” The news was first reported by Andrew Brooks, the publisher and
  owner of Showcase magazine, the publication where Vogler works, who posted a
  video on Facebook stating that Vogler had been attacked in the magazine’s
  offices. “An individual forced his way into to our office, carrying a
  five-gallon bucket of gasoline, and poured the gasoline on Lee,” Brooks said.
  “Lee attempted to flee and ran in front of the building. The individual
  followed him and set him on fire.” Brooks said Vogler was awake and talking
  and that he was en route to the burn center in Lynchburg. “Our hearts and
  prayers are with him,” Brooks said, adding that he and his colleagues were
  cooperating with the local police. “This type of senseless act of violence has
  to stop,” Brooks said. “You do not have the right as a human being to get
  upset with someone enough to lash out and attempt to harm them in any way,
  much less this way.”
