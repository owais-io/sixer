  The most obvious thing to say is that Arsenal have become an unstoppable
  attacking force. The other glaring point to emerge during this breezy 5-0 win
  over Leeds United, though, is that Arsenal are desperately crying out for
  Eberechi Eze’s invention in the final third. There can be no in between, no
  blurred lines. In an age of extreme reactions, there can only be one truth.
  Take Viktor Gyökeres, who is both lumbering £64m dud and rampaging goal brute
  all at the same time. He was written off by some after enduring a difficult
  debut against Manchester United but was in encouraging form less than a week
  later, offering hints of what he will bring to Arsenal’s forward line by
  putting his running power to good use against Leeds. Conclusion? Tougher tests
  are on the way for the big Swede. Next for Arsenal comes a trip to Liverpool.
  It has been a promising start to the season for Mikel Arteta’s side, who have
  opened it with two wins, two clean sheets and one gazumping of Tottenham in
  the transfer window. Eze, who was given a huge ovation when he was unveiled
  before kick-off against Leeds, has joined from Crystal Palace after snubbing
  Spurs and is sure to add extra layers to Arsenal’s attack. He could play off
  the left, cutting inside to link the play against deep defences, although
  perhaps he will operate as a No 10, which will be his shirt number. Either
  way, there is no doubt that Arteta has far more depth at his disposal. A
  repeat of last year’s injury crisis need not spell the end of Arsenal’s title
  challenge this time around. Yet those nagging doubts were not entirely
  dispelled with victory over Leeds, who had the Emirates Stadium on edge before
  Set Piece FC went ahead through a Jurriën Timber header from a Declan Rice
  corner in the 34th minute. Arsenal may be exploring a new attacking identity
  this season but the sense remains that they risk being held back by old
  failings. After all, it should not be overlooked that there were a few groans
  from the crowd before the deadlock was broken. Leeds did well at first,
  restricting Arsenal to few clear opportunities. Daniel Farke’s side, who do
  not look out of their depth after coming up as champions, were awkward before
  being ground down. The strange thing is that Arsenal were unconvincing for
  much of the first half. They are trying to develop new patterns – Martín
  Zubimendi and Rice led a good counterpress from midfield and there were some
  lovely sweeping passes out to the flanks – but there were plenty of overhit
  passes and missed connections. The angst in the air was palpable. Gyökeres was
  nervy, snatching one chance wide when he had time to take a touch. There was
  frustration when Martin Ødegaard delayed a cross and passed backwards. There
  is a theory that Arteta has become too obsessed with set-piece goals. That
  Arsenal are too imposing. Eze will hopefully bring more fantasy. It took one
  of Rice’s inswinging deliveries to shatter the tension, Timber rising highest
  to head in for 1-0. By then Ødegaard had limped off and made way for Ethan
  Nwaneri. There were positives and negatives. Arsenal’s second goal was
  excellent, Rice winning possession high, Zubimendi involved before Timber
  played Bukayo Saka in to lash a rising drive past Lucas Perri. Eight minutes
  into the second half there was the worrying sight of Saka sitting on the turf
  and feeling the back of his left leg. The winger could not continue and is a
  major doubt to face Liverpool, which is hardly ideal given Arsenal may also be
  without Ødegaard, Kai Havertz, Ben White and Gabriel Jesus when they take on
  the champions. The consolation for Arteta is that he has more options this
  season. Just as important, there are signs that Arsenal are beginning to play
  to Gyökeres’s strengths. He needs room to attack, balls to chase, defenders to
  annoy. He had all of that when Riccardo Calafiori hoicked a first-time up and
  under down the left channel in the 48th minute. Gyökeres immediately set off,
  rumbled past Pascal Struijk, cut inside, held off Jayden Bogle and arrowed an
  angled shot inside the near post. The former Sporting Lisbon striker’s first
  Arsenal goal was a relief. Timber converted from another corner. Max Dowman
  sparkled after coming on for his debut. The 15-year-old – yes, 15 – was
  probably a little naughty when he made the most of a slight touch to win a
  stoppage-time penalty that Gyökeres converted. Ideas for a suitable punishment
  for Dowman’s opportunistic tumble ranged from being sent to bed with no dinner
  to being denied Nintendo Switch privileges for the next week. Arsenal ended it
  feeling optimistic about the future. They were also struggling to shake off
  familiar concerns. Past failings may come back to haunt them. The alternative
  reading is that Arteta 2.0 is taking shape.
