  Donald Trump has renewed a threat to impose sanctions on Russia if there is no
  progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks, showing
  frustration at Moscow a week after his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska.
  “I’m going to make a decision as to what we do and it’s going to be, it’s
  going to be a very important decision, and that’s whether or not it’s massive
  sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it’s your
  fight,” the US president said on Friday. He said he was unhappy about Russia’s
  strike on an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that
  injured some of the facility’s employees. At the same White House event where
  he mentioned possible sanctions, he showed a photograph of his meeting with
  Putin on the red carpet in Alaska, saying Putin wanted to attend the World Cup
  2026 football tournament in the US. “I’m going to sign this for him. But I was
  sent one, and I thought you would like to see it, it’s a man named Vladimir
  Putin, who I believe will be coming, depending on what happens. He may be
  coming, and he may not, depending on what happens,” Trump said. The Ukrainian
  president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile said Russia was doing everything it
  could to prevent a meeting between him and Putin. Zelenskyy has repeatedly
  called for Putin to meet him, saying it is the only way to negotiate an end to
  the war. He accused Russia of stalling. “The meeting is one of the components
  of how to end the war,” he said on Friday at a press conference in Kyiv with
  Nato secretary general Mark Rutte. “And since they don’t want to end it, they
  will look for space to [avoid it].” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov,
  told NBC there was no agenda for such a summit. “Putin is ready to meet with
  Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not
  ready at all,” he said. During a visit to a nuclear research centre on Friday,
  Putin said Trump’s leadership qualities would help restore US-Russia
  relations. “With the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the
  end of the tunnel has finally loomed. And now we had a very good, meaningful
  and frank meeting in Alaska,” Putin said. Ukraine has attacked a key pumping
  station on the Druzhba oil pipeline bringing fuel to Europe from Russia,
  Deborah Cole reports. The attack knocked out supplies to Hungary and Slovakia,
  the only remaining EU member states still receiving Russian oil. The Hungarian
  and Slovakian governments wrote to the European Commission after the attack,
  saying that Russian oil supplies could be suspended for at least five days
  owing to the damage. “The physical and geographical reality is that without
  this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible,” their
  foreign ministers, Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár, said in a letter. The
  Russian warlord and businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin looked “doomed” after his
  failed mutiny and told his mother he expected to die in the days before his
  private plane crash, Pjotr Sauer reports. Prigozhin, the founder of the
  notorious Wagner mercenary group, died when his business jet went down in the
  summer of 2023, two months after his fighters briefly seized control of the
  southern city of Rostov-on-Don and advanced towards Moscow in a short-lived
  rebellion against Russia’s military leadership. “When I last saw him, he
  looked doomed,” said Violetta Prigozhina, 85, in an interview with the Russian
  outlet Fontanka.
