  It is the simple life-saving sequence taught in many a first aid lesson: when
  someone collapses, first check their airways, then breathing and finally
  circulation before starting chest compressions if needed. But experts have
  warned this approach to CPR could be increasing the risk of death for athletes
  experiencing a cardiac arrest. Researchers in Israel say a focus on clearing
  airways, and in particular the mistaken belief it is possible to swallow your
  tongue, is leading to delays in starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation in such
  cases. “The first response should be immediate initiation of chest
  compressions,” said Dr Dana Viskin, of Tel Aviv University. Viskin said the
  tongue was anchored in the mouth by different muscles and ligaments, making it
  impossible to swallow – although she noted paralysis or total relaxation of
  the main muscle of the tongue could obstruct the airways and lead to
  suffocation. But Viskin said an initial focus on airways when responding to
  cardiac arrest events in athletes was problematic. “A quick response –
  especially chest compressions and early defibrillation – is critical. Time
  spent checking the airway or trying to prevent ‘tongue swallowing’ only delays
  life-saving treatment,” she said. Writing in the Canadian journal of
  Cardiology, Viskin and colleagues identified online footage of 45 cases
  between 1990 and 2024 in which athletes collapsed during competitions or
  training and underwent attempts at resuscitation. The first action taken by
  others was visible in 38 of the cases. Thirty of the athletes had a cardiac
  arrest. In 27 of these cases, the first response involved “inappropriate”
  actions, such as preventing tongue swallowing by forcing open the athlete’s
  mouth, before starting CPR. This was the case when Denmark’s Christian Eriksen
  collapsed on the pitch during the Euro 2020 match against Finland in 2021. The
  researchers said that in 18 of these 27 cases, the athlete was known to have
  subsequently died or remained in a vegetative state. None of the three
  athletes who received CPR as the first response had such outcomes. “The small
  number of cases without an attempt to prevent ‘tongue swallowing’ does limit
  the ability to draw strong statistical comparisons regarding outcomes like
  brain injury,” said Viskin. “However, there is a striking consistency of the
  incorrect initial response across most cases and that itself is a powerful
  finding.” The researchers also studied high-visibility news articles about the
  cases, finding many used the term “tongue swallowing” and often praised
  actions to prevent it. “This is important because such reports have enormous
  numbers of views,” the authors wrote. The team suggested the myth of tongue
  swallowing appeared to be widespread and could have been unintentionally
  promoted by the airways, breathing, circulation (A-B-C) sequence for basic
  CPR. They said these steps were in effect reordered to C-A-B in the American
  Heart Association CPR guidelines in 2010. A spokesperson for the College of
  Paramedics said its advice to members of the public witnessing a suspected
  cardiac arrest was to follow the Resuscitation Council UK guidance for CPR,
  starting chest compressions and calling 999 if someone became unconscious,
  unresponsive, and was not breathing or breathing noisily. “Early chest
  compressions are recognised to be of critical importance in saving individuals
  experiencing cardiac arrest and that’s why paramedics will not delay chest
  compressions,” they said. “When trained professionals and responders manage
  patients experiencing sudden cardiac arrest, chest compressions will be
  prioritised whilst another professional manages the airway.”
