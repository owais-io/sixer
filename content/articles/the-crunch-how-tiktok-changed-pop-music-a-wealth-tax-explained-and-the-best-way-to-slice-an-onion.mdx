  way to slice an onion

  Hello and welcome to the latest late edition of The Crunch! In this week’s
  newsletter we have charts on the most mathematically sound way to slice an
  onion, which countries Trump’s new tariffs are going to target, how the
  airline industry is struggling to get sustainable fuel projects off the
  ground, how TikTok has changed the length of pop songs, whether a wealth tax
  could work in the UK and the record rise in uncertainty. But first … have men
  really stopped reading books? The demise of men reading books has, once again,
  been greatly exaggerated. A recent article about Australians’ reading habits
  claimed “Australians, especially men, are reading less than ever before” and
  “the data showed females, on average, were reading more than males across all
  age groups”. Another ran with the headline “Young men have stopped reading
  books – and these are the reasons why”, which also said “the percentage of men
  who would pick up any book at all is very small”. Nick took a deep dive into
  the surprisingly chaotic world of reading statistics and tracked down some
  hitherto unpublished survey data to show that reading has declined, regardless
  of gender: The data also shows that a significant proportion of males are
  still reading books, though they’re doing so less frequently than they used
  to. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. How TikTok has changed pop music We
  loved this piece from the BBC’s Mark Savage and Jess Carr, which looked at the
  duration of songs in the UK top 40 over time: The data shows a marked shift
  towards shorter tracks in the years after the release of TikTok. The article
  also goes into how song structure can change when the song is shorter overall
  and how more recently, there’s been a shift back to longer songs. *** 2. Where
  Trump’s new tariffs will fall The New York Times graphics team has this simple
  but effective map showing how countries around the world will be affected by
  new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration: You can also toggle the map
  to show a cartogram where the counties are sized by import values! *** 3. How
  the airline industry is struggling to get sustainable fuel off the ground
  Reuters has produced an excellent investigation and visual feature looking at
  how the airline industry is struggling with sustainable jet fuel programs:
  Reuters reports that of the 165 sustainable fuel projects announced over the
  past 12 years, only 36 have materialised. *** 4. Could a wealth tax work in
  the UK? The UK, like Australia, is grappling with the prospect of how to
  change their tax system. This visual feature from our UK colleagues lays out
  how much money a wealth tax could raise and how it might work: Depending on
  how a wealth tax is designed, it could raise significantly more revenue than a
  freeze on income tax thresholds. *** 4. We live in interesting times In news
  that will surprised no one, global uncertainty has reached record highs: We
  came across this chart while reading Nicki Hutley’s opinion piece about how we
  should focus less on interest rates in Australia. According to the economists
  who devised the index it is “computed by counting the percent of the word
  uncertain (or its variant) in the Economist Intelligence Unit country
  reports”. A higher number means higher uncertainty, and the index is
  apparently associated with “greater economic policy uncertainty (EPU), stock
  market volatility, risk and lower GDP growth”. Our bookmarks Summer holidays
  in Paris How your phone gets the weather How much of Gaza is left standing?
  European cartographers’ inaccurate maps of Australia have plenty to teach us
  Texas redistricting: how new Republican maps will hurt Democrats Off the
  Charts What is the most mathematically optimal way to cut an onion? It’s an
  interesting geometry problem, which is laid out in amazing detail here by
  Andrew Aquino and colleagues in The Pudding: The level of detail and design
  flourishes here (the onion font!!!) are amazing. Make sure you hit the explode
