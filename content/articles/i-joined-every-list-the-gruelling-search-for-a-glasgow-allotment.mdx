  Nestled among tenement flats and light industrial units in Glasgow’s south
  side is one of the oldest allotment sites in Scotland, having moved to its
  current location in 1872. New Victoria Gardens (NVG) is not a huge site, with
  just 70 or so plots. But according to Andrew Greg, a committee member and
  longstanding plot-holder at NVG, there are about 300 people on the waiting
  list and just three to four will get a space every year. One would-be
  plot-holder is Ralph Bennett-Richards, who joined the council’s allotment
  waiting list two years ago after moving into his central Glasgow flat. He is
  among the two-thirds of the city’s population living in flats, as opposed to
  houses, meaning few people in the city have gardens. “I’d be happy with any
  allotment that I can cycle to from my flat,” says Bennett-Richards.
  Unfortunately for him and many others, the issue is not one of distance, but a
  lack of available plots. Often located in built-up areas, it can be hard, if
  not impossible, to expand existing sites. With little public money available
  to create new allotments, one different approach to expanding provision is
  being taken by Roots, a Bath-based company that recently opened its 14th site
  of privately owned allotment provision in England, and is looking for its
  first location north of the border in the Glasgow area. Two of Roots’
  co-founders, Ed Morrison and Will Gay, describe how they use a combination of
  modern and traditional methods to identify sites, with more than 1,000 people
  (full disclosure – including me) already on their Glasgow waiting list. “When
  we think about launching in a new location, we’ll set up digital ads to see
  who wants to sign up. And we got the most amount of clicks for the least
  amount of money spent in Glasgow. So that shows there’s a huge demand for us
  there,” Morrison said. Plots at Roots sites range from £10 to £50 a month,
  depending on plot size, contrasting with £17 to £60 a year for a Glasgow city
  council plot, although these prices are set to triple in the next five years.
  However, in return Roots says it offers members much more support, including
  ready-to-plant plots, communal tools, free seeds, plug plants and workshops
  throughout the year. Its founders say they see it as complementing rather than
  competing with traditional sites: 70% of members had never grown food before
  joining Roots and 60% had never been on a waiting list for another allotment.
  A flexible membership model allows people to see if they can commit the time
  that is required to look after a plot. As Lindsey Duncan, who shares a plot on
  a council-owned allotment site in the south-west of the city, points out, many
  people underestimate how much time an allotment can take up. In Glasgow a
  “full-size” allotment is 125 sq metres, about the size of half a tennis court.
  Smaller plot sizes could help, she suggests, an approach that some allotment
  associations in Glasgow are trying. A smaller plot was ideal for Jane, who
  started with a “micro-plot” of six sq metres at Croftburn allotments in the
  south-east of Glasgow. “I put my name on every allotment waiting list I could
  find,” says Jane, who moved to Glasgow two and a half years ago. After a year
  on the micro-plot, which helped her to build confidence and get to know other
  plot-holders, she has just graduated to a larger plot, freeing up the
  micro-plot for someone else on the waiting list. Duncan, who used to work for
  a community growing charity, suggested pairing people on waiting lists with
  longstanding older plot-holders who can struggle to look after their plots, to
  pass on knowledge to the next generation. One area of Glasgow that feels a
  little closer to nature is Sighthill in the north of the city, where the
  council recently opened a new allotment site as part of a major urban
  regeneration project. Sighthill had become a byword for the failures of
  post-second world war urban planning, which resulted in swathes of the city
  being bulldozed to make way for concrete tower blocks and dual carriageways.
  The same building boom that brought Sighthill into the world also contributed
  to the demise of many of Glasgow’s allotments, which had helped to feed the
  city during two world wars – there was 1 sq metre of allotment space per
  resident in the city in 1950 compared with 0.6 sq metres today. The 20 new
  plots will barely make a dent in the city’s allotment waiting list, but the
  turning over of land that was previously concreted to a new generation of
  growers brings hope of further progress.
