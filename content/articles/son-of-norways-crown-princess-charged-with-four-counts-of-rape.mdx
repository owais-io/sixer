  Marius Borg Høiby, the son of the Norwegian crown princess, has been charged
  with 32 offences including four counts of rape, a prosecutor has said. Høiby,
  whose mother is the crown princess, Mette-Marit, and whose stepfather is the
  crown prince, Haakon, Norway’s future king, is expected to stand trial early
  next year and could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of the most
  serious charges. The charges, made public on Monday, include the rape of four
  different women, domestic abuse of a former partner, and illegally filming a
  number of women, including their genitals, without their knowledge or consent.
  He is also charged with harassment of police and traffic violations. Høiby’s
  lawyer, Petar Sekulic, who is representing him together with Ellen Holager
  Andaenæs, said: “Our client denies all charges of sexual abuse, as well as the
  majority of the charges regarding violence. He will present a detailed account
  of his version of events before the court.” In June, Høiby was charged with 23
  offences, including three counts of rape, by the police prosecutor before the
  case was sent to the state prosecutor. Høiby is alleged to have raped four
  women between 2018 and November 2024. All the alleged assaults allegedly took
  place after consensual intercourse while the women were sleeping. Høiby is
  accused of filming all the women during the alleged rapes. As he presented the
  indictment against Høiby on Monday, the state attorney Sturla Henriksbø said:
  “This case is very serious. Rape and violence in close relationships are very
  serious acts that can leave lasting traces and destroy lives.” Høiby’s status
  as part of the royal family, he added, would “not mean that he is treated more
  leniently or strictly than if similar acts were committed by others”. The
  maximum penalty for the charges in the indictment is 10 years in prison,
  Henriksbø said. The state prosecutor, who is understood to have spent the last
  month and a half deliberating over whether Høiby would be indicted and on what
  charges, said the trial could take place in January over approximately six
  weeks. Hoiby does not have a royal title and is outside the line of royal
  succession. The Norwegian royal court said: “It is for the courts to consider
  this matter and reach a decision. We have no further comment.”
