  #Charlottesville review – urgent voices against the alt-right’s extremist

  ‘If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention,” says one of the voices
  in this urgent verbatim show about the rise of the “alt-right”. Eight years
  ago this month, a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulted
  in three deaths and at least 19 serious injuries. If it did not attract the
  same level of global attention as the mob attack on the US Capitol
  three-and-a-half years later, it raised a similar red flag about the rise of
  extremist ideology in the US and beyond. Priyanka Shetty was an acting student
  at the University of Virginia at the time of the clash between protesters and
  counter-protesters and set about recording the community’s responses. She
  spoke to fellow citizens, trawled far right websites, found contemporary news
  reports and, more recently, got hold of court transcripts from the prosecution
  of the white-supremacist conspirators. In a polished and confident
  performance, directed by Yury Urnov for Richard Jordan and Yellow Raincoat
  productions, she snaps quickly from voice to voice to create a social collage:
  those who saw trouble coming, those blind-sided by it and those defiant in
  their racist tribalism. Lawyers talk about first amendment rights, officials
  talk about the joy of life in a friendly college town and witnesses comment on
  the indifference of police officers as violence erupted. The tapestry of
  perspectives makes #Charlottesville not just an obvious condemnation of
  loathsome beliefs, but a richer vision of how such disruption tears at the
  social fabric. Going a step further, the Indian-born Shetty weaves in her own
  experience of discrimination: a joke in class about her appearance; failing to
  get a part in either of the college productions; her complaints brushed aside
  by a dismissive teacher. Isolated incidents or part of a racist continuum that
  stretches from small acts of exclusion to the murderous ideology of fascism? •
