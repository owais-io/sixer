  Alex Toth has just scored an absolute screamer to put Ferencvaros 3-2 up at
  Qarabag, and they need one more goal in the last 10 minutes or so to take the
  game into extra time. Qarabag and Ferencvaros are currently drawing 2-2 in the
  early kick-off, with Qarabag therefore nursing a 5-3 aggregate advantage. The
  lineups for the late Champions League games, meanwhile, are here: Benfica v
  Fenerbahce Benfica: Trubin, Dedic, Antonio Silva, Otamendi, Dahl, Rios,
  Barrenechea, Aursnes, Barreiro, Akturkoglu, Pavlidis. Subs: Soares, Obrador,
  Ivanovic, Schjelderup, Prestianni, Henrique Araujo, Tomas Araujo, Gouveia,
  Oliveira, Veloso, Santos, Prioste. Fenerbahce: Livakovic, Muldur, Skriniar,
  Oosterwolde, Nelson Semedo, Amrabat, Fred, Brown, Szymanski, En Nesyri,
  Talisca. Subs: Egribayat, Yuksek, Djiku, Duran, Demir, Kahveci, Under, Munir
  Mercan, Elmaz, Aydin, Akcicek, Soyuncu. Referee: Slavko Vincic (Slovenia).
  Club Brugge v Rangers Club Brugge: Mignolet, Sabbe, Spileers, Mechele, Seys,
  Stankovic, Nwadike, Forbs, Vanaken, Tzolis, Tresoldi. Subs: Jackers, Romero,

  Not quite so many matches tonight as there were yesterday, but it’s about
  quality not quantity and after Celtic stunk out Tuesday evening there’s
  definite room for improvement there. We’ve got just four Champions League
  fixtures to keep an eye out for, one of which started a while ago, and
  precisely the same number of Carabao Cup games. And they are: Champions League
  play-off second leg (kick-offs 8pm BST unless stated) Benfica v Fenerbahce
  (0-0 after first leg) Club Brugge v Rangers (Brugge won the first leg 3-1)
  Copenhagen v Basel (the first leg was drawn 1-1) Qarabag FK v Ferencvaros
  (5.45pm BST, Qarabag won the first leg 3-1) Carabao Cup second round (7.45pm
  BST kick-offs unless stated) Everton v Mansfield Fulham v Bristol City Grimsby
  v Man Utd (8pm) Oxford Utd v Brighton Also tonight: Celta Vigo v Real Betis in
  La Liga (8pm), Bayern Munich play a first-round German cup tie at Wehen
  Wiesbaden (7.45pm), Hamilton Academical host Edinburgh City in the Scottish
  Challenge Cup (7.45pm), and Hibernian play a Women’s Champions League
  qualifying semi-final against Fortuna Hjorring (7.30pm). And while we wait for
  all of that: It’s all looking very grim for West Ham, says Jacob Steinberg:
