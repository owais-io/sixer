  How wonderful to read Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen’s panegyric on Blackpool
  illuminations (‘Where design gets to take its bra off’: Laurence
  Llewelyn-Bowen on his 20 years with the Blackpool Illuminations, 25 August).
  My mother was a Blackpool landlady, I grew up there, and – even after nearly
  30 years living in Berlin – the resort still has a special place in my heart.
  Twenty million visitors a year can’t all be wrong. Llewelyn-Bowen wonders why
  Blackpool’s unique appeal doesn’t seem to register with people living in the
  south of England. Look no further than the British Tourist Authority, whose
  budget is lavished on anywhere but Britain’s great seaside resorts, Blackpool
  included. I know this because, working in the media, I am on the receiving end
  of most of VisitBritain’s PR output to the German public. I once wrote to
  VisitBritain’s German office decrying its lack of coverage of Blackpool and
  other resorts, and received the reply: “Blackpool is not a particularly
  attractive place.” Julian Allitt Berlin, Germany • While the appeal of
  Blackpool’s illuminations may not have spread beyond the Midlands, the
  Southend illuminations (deemed at times to be the best in the world) have been
  brightening our lives since 1935. They are still going strong, and combined
  with firework displays, they do much to counter the gloom of autumn and winter
  for “magnolia-shaded Farrow &amp; Ball-obsessed” southerners, as Laurence
  Llewelyn-Bowen calls us. And surely Southend’s pleasure pier, the longest in
  the world at 1.33 miles, rivals Blackpool’s tower? Maybe when the young
  Llewelyn-Bowen was disporting himself in London, he should have come to
  Southend on a day trip and gained some inspiration for his endeavours in
  Blackpool. Rev Ruth Cartwright Rayleigh, Essex • Have an opinion on anything
