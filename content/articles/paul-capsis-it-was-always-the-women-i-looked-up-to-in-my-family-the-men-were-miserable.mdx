  Paul Capsis: ‘It was always the women I looked up to in my family. The men
  were miserable’

  The Fitzroy weather turns from unseasonably muggy to reassuringly bitter as
  soon as we emerge from Mario’s on Brunswick Street, but cabaret legend Paul
  Capsis has come prepared and whips out an oversized umbrella. “I knew to
  expect anything,” he smiles, making it sound like a personal creed. Capsis is
  a born-and-bred Sydneysider, and yet he claims that “90% of people I speak to
  think I was born in Melbourne, that I grew up or that I’m based here.” Perhaps
  it’s the attitude – the spikiness and intensity of his onstage persona, or
  that slightly subterranean aura of the demimonde he carries with him in the
  real world – that makes him seem better suited to the moodier southern
  metropolis. Slightly built, with his long chestnut hair pulled back from his
  leonine face, Capsis is petite but striking as he swishes an ample scarf
  around his neck. While primarily a stage performer – he’s appeared in
  everything from Bertolt Brecht to Rocky Horror – Capsis first leapt to
  national attention in Ana Kokkinos’s Head On, the 1998 film adaptation of
  Christos Tsiolkas’s debut novel, Loaded. He played the protagonist’s best
  friend, Johnny, who moonlights as drag diva Toula in defiance of his strict
  religious Greek upbringing. “My father is Greek and my mother’s family are
  Maltese,” Capsis says. “I knew this world. I knew these men.” Patriarchal and
  socially conservative, it was a challenging and sometimes scary place for a
  young boy trying to navigate his gender and sexuality. “But it was always the
  women I looked up to in my family. The men were miserable.” When his parents
  split up, Capsis moved to Surry Hills in the inner city, where he was raised
  largely by his maternal grandmother, Angela. Capsis maintains that he was “so
  naive as a child. I knew nothing about sex”. This changed dramatically when he
  started performing around the Sydney drag circuit in the late 80s; the
  bitchiness and misogyny among gay men in the scene at the time, he says, also
  came as a shock. “I’d entered a world that was so bizarre to me. The drinks
  and the drugs. I thought I’d found my people, but I was a minority among my
  people. I wasn’t fully embraced.” As we pass the Provincial hotel on the
  corner of Brunswick and Johnson Streets, Capsis grabs my arm. “This is where I
  first met Ana [Kokkinos]! I’d just read the book and she’d asked to meet me,
  not to be in the film but to consult about the Greek aspects of the
  character.” He went to the meeting in character and soon Kokkinos and the
  casting director were asking him all sorts of questions. He didn’t realise it,
  but they were sizing him up for the role. In some key way, Capsis’s
  performance in Head On came to define a certain queer, second-generation
  migrant experience, tied inextricably to old-world European traditions while
  desperate to carve a space in an Australia that spurned their ethnicity. “I
  had a very conservative Catholic upbringing, sheltered in many ways.” Angela –
  whom Capsis adored and would immortalise in his acclaimed solo show, Angela’s
  Kitchen – was a stalwart presence, fiercely loyal. “When I was a child, I was
  adamant that I was a girl,” Capsis recalls, matter-of-factly. “I remember
  vividly the adults standing over me and insisting I was a boy and I’d be
  screaming ‘No! I’m a girl.’ It was pretty traumatic.” But whenever the men of
  the house tried to punish him for his perceived femininity, Angela would
  intervene. “My grandmother would sort of protect me from all that. She’d
  demand I be left alone.” Puberty was particularly monstrous for Capsis but
  also a catalyst for some kind of self awareness. “When I hit puberty, my body
  started to go to war with me. Around 15, I started to negotiate what this all
  was,” Capsis says, swiping a hand down his body. “I said to myself, you are
  like a woman, you’re a guy and you like men. You’re just gonna have to deal
  with it. I’m not going to have anything chopped off, I’m not going to have
  anything added. I’m gonna be me and hope for the best.” While Capsis
  acknowledges that a contemporary understanding of gender “would have given me
  words around my experience”, he is unconcerned about labels and doesn’t
  identify as trans. “I’m a feminine gay man.” Capsis began his career “playing
  dead women”, impersonating (although channelling might be the apposite word)
  the often tragically complex divas of the past, legends like Janis Joplin,
  Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. Eventually, theatre visionary Barrie Kosky
  would conjure an ideal platform for this strange act of possession, Boulevard
  Delirium. It was arguably the sharpest, most dazzling piece of cabaret the
  country’s ever seen. While it folded in some of the grotesquerie of drag, it
  seemed to spring from a deeper, more empathetic well. Capsis nods
  enthusiastically as we discuss this, the husky crack in his voice opening
  slightly. “The women I was obsessed with growing up were all strong women, if
  not in their character then in their voice. People like Judy Garland, Edith
  Piaf, Janis Joplin. These women had something so powerful, but it comes out of
  their life experience.” Capsis’s career has seen him play some of queer
  history’s most revered figures, including Oscar Wilde and Quentin Crisp, as
  well as icons such as Marlene Dietrich. He’s about to play multiple roles in
  Sydney Theatre Company’s upcoming production of The Shiralee, and it’s a safe
  bet that at least one of them will be a woman. “I come from strong stock,”
  Capsis says, a note of pride peaking through as we huddle under the cover of a
  shop awning, rain really coming down now. “My grandmother literally gave birth
  to my mother during an air raid. She was tough.” That familial connection has
  been one of the reasons Capsis has stayed in Sydney, even when a career in New
  York or Berlin beckoned. “I did choose to stay close to my grandmother and
  then when she died, my mother. It was a decision I made consciously and I
  don’t regret it.” Capsis’s mother died less than a year ago and while he still
  grieves for her, he admits “It has freed me up. I can finally consider moving
  places, travelling for longer periods. I’ve never been to Paris. Perhaps I’ll
  go there next.” He could always move to Melbourne, where he seems part of the
  fabric of the city, or revisit Malta and the cradle of his forebears. “I’ve
  performed in Malta. It’s fascinating but so Catholic.” He is often mistaken
  for a trans woman there, and has been laughed at in the streets. It’s the sort
  of thing that might cower or diminish anyone else, but Capsis – who was
  bullied mercilessly at school – is hard to intimidate. He confronted them in
  his mother’s language: “I’m not crawling under a rock for you. I’m not going
  to hide for you.” As he recounts this, someone turns from across the street to
  stare. Capsis laughs uproariously, but then turns to me fiercely. “The women I
  loved, they didn’t put up with shit. They were fighting.”
