  staff, gutted funding’

  Dozens of former rangers, park volunteers, and local residents protested at
  the gateway to Montana’s Glacier national park on Wednesday against the staff
  cuts and hiring freezes that have thrown many national parks into crisis,
  including Glacier. Current and former staffers and watchdog groups say the
  cuts have meant staff are not able to keep up the facilities and
  infrastructure. Some say the park has been left with inadequate infrastructure
  and too little staff to be able to respond to emergencies. Although it might
  look to visitors like operations in Glacier are normal, “it’s like walking
  down a Hollywood movie set where the front looks great but there’s nothing
  behind it,” said Sarah Lundstrum, Glacier program manager with the National
  Parks Conservation Association. The protesters held signs, chanted and waved
  at tourists during a visit to the park from the Congressional Western Caucus.
  Hosted by the Montana Republican congressman and former interior secretary
  Ryan Zinke, the caucus came to the park to showcase the success of the 2020
  Great American Outdoors Act, which secured federal funding for protection and
  maintenance of public lands. Montana’s Republican senator Steve Daines
  championed that bill during Donald Trump’s first term, calling it “the
  greatest conservation win for Montana and the entire country in 50 years”. In
  May, Daines introduced the America the Beautiful Act to extend federal funding
  for projects to address crucial maintenance backlogs. But congressional
  support for funding projects in national parks comes at a jarring disconnect
  with the Trump administration’s slashing of jobs at national parks
  countrywide, including at Glacier, where an already overworked staff has been
  left with little to no bandwidth to implement projects. No congressional
  Republicans, including Daines or Zinke, have spoken up against the cuts and
  freezes, and all voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that rescinded $276m
  from the National Park Service (NPS). “We’re supporting the park, but drawing
  attention to the fact our policymakers are grandstanding in a national park
  where behind the scenes they’ve gutted staff and gutted funding,” said Suzanne
  Hindler, one of the rally’s organizers. She said organizers specifically chose
  to hold the event outside the park to avoid adding more work for already
  overburdened park staff during peak tourist season. Hindler emphasized that
  funding for national parks was crucial. But without the staff to execute the
  work, new problems would arise with no one to fix them, she said. Jan
  Metzmaker, a longtime park employee who was on Glacier’s first all-women trail
  crew in the 1970s, said: “I can see the deterioration in the services and in
  the facilities. “They really need to put some money into those, because this
  place is crazy with people. It’s being loved to death. But there’s no way that
  they can do the maintenance and all the things that need to be done in the
  park now.” Visitation to national parks reached a record 331.9 million last
  year. But because of the Trump administration’s hiring freezes, terminations,
  and buyout and early retirement offers, US national parks have lost nearly a
  quarter of permanent staff, with seasonal hiring behind by nearly 8,000
  positions. Further staff cuts, described as “deep and blunt” and “aggressive
  and swift” by National Parks Traveler, the multi-media outlet that covers the
  NPS, are held up in court but may still be forthcoming. In Glacier, which has
  seen a 7.5% increase in visitors from last year’s record high, the park is
  trying to operate with a 25% loss of staff. Vacancies span from chief ranger
  and fire positions, wildlife scientists, multiple environmental impact
  analysis positions, and emergency services, to mechanics, electricians,
  plumbers and IT positions. After the federal government canceled all national
  parks’ internet contracts this year, Lundstrum said, Glacier now uses
  StarLink, which some staffers say is spotty, goes down entirely, and often
  fails to connect park dispatch and 911 calls. There’s only one IT person
  remaining to address technical problems, those staffers, who asked to remain
  anonymous because they fear retaliation for speaking out, in a park that spans
  the Continental Divide, has no cell service, and regularly sees lost and
  injured hikers and encounters with wildlife, including the park’s dense
  population of grizzly bears. On top of that, said a current park employee who
  spoke on condition of anonymity, there are no longer enough staff to safely
  respond to emergencies. It’s only luck “that the park hasn’t had any big
  events this year”, they said. “In past years we’ve had big fires, major
  search-and-rescue operations, really critical injuries. It’s only a matter of
  time until there’s an event we can’t respond to appropriately and there’s a
  mass failure of a system.” And yet the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, issued
  an order in April requiring all parks to remain “open and accessible” despite
  the reduced staff. In Glacier, that might come at the cost of visitor and
  staff safety. The Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to a
  request for comment on the concerns the staffers and watchdog groups raised.
  The offices of Zinke and Daines also did not respond to a request for comment.
  The staffers say that remaining staff are doing “twice the job they used to”.
  Law enforcement are covering twice their previous area, maintenance workers
  are doing jobs they are not trained for, and outside recreation operators,
  such as Glacier Guides and Montana Raft, are emptying trash and cleaning
  bathrooms at river accesses to make up for the gaps. The mentality inside the
  park, said the employee, “is that if you’re the only one left, you’ll do
  whatever you can to help”. The Association of National Park Rangers reported
  that “amid federal budget cuts, some seasonal employees at Yosemite national
  park worked for as long as six weeks without pay in recent months as park
  supervisors struggled to manage hiring”. One of the rally attenders, a local
  woman named Kathy who asked not to be identified by her last name, is a
  volunteer with the Glacier National Park Association. “We do restoration,
  painting, backcountry patrol, visitor center, vehicle reservations. We want to
  do things, but unfortunately, we don’t have enough supervisors – rangers – to
  have volunteers.” “It feels like the government is setting us up to fail,”
  said the Glacier employee. Experts worry that Trump’s budget proposal to cut
  36% of the national park budget, which could force the closure of up to 350
  park units, is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the park system as an excuse
  to sell those lands for profit. “Hollowing out staffing, cutting budgets,
  changing priorities – all of that very much lends itself to the idea of
  essentially causing those agencies to fail at meeting their mandates, and that
  will lead to the call for privatization,” said Lundstrum. “Because if the
  government can’t manage that land, then obviously somebody else should, right?
  In documents like Project 2025, there are calls for the privatization of land,
  or the selloff of land.” Multiple sources say that morale among Glacier staff
  is low. “The civilian federal workforce used to be non-partisan, so you always
  felt like you could have your opinion – liberal or conservative – without fear
  of retribution,” said one employee. “And now the undertone is to stay under
  the radar. If you speak up and say, ‘this is wrong’, you pretty much have a
  target on your back.” One young mother who came to the rally with her two
  small sons asked not to be identified because her husband is a federal
  employee; just this month, the justice department fired an official whose
  husband developed a phone app that tracked Ice agents. “Having these two
  little guys is just a constant reminder of how much our world is changing, and
  the need to stand up for it. Everything could be gone in a blink,” the mother
  said. Glacier is also the national park poster child for climate change, as
  its namesake glaciers are predicted to be completely gone in the coming
  decades. Yet the administration, without any pushback from congressional
  Republicans, has cut and scrubbed climate science and reversed Biden-era
  initiatives to curb climate change. In his press release, Daines said he
  introduced the America the Beautiful Act “so that people can get outside and
  enjoy the natural beauty we’re lucky to have here in the US”, and that he was
  “proud” to “protect our outdoor way of life for generations to come”. Hildner
  said she was not fooled. She said: “To see capitalism as the driving force for
  managing lands, rather than conservation, is really terrifying: for myself,
  for what it means for future generations, and what it means for the planet.
  How do we as a public help the folks who’ve been elected to govern see what
  the real costs are?”
