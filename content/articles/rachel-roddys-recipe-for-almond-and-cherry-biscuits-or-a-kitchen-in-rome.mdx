  Similar in principle to fig rolls, biscotti di ceglie consist of pastry
  wrapped around a filling of jam, so they have an irregular and extremely
  rustic cube form. Known locally as u’ piscquett’l, these biscuits are typical
  of the town and commune of Ceglie Messapica in the province of Brindisi in
  Puglia. Ceglie Messapica is also part of the southern reaches of the Murgia, a
  karst topographic plateau sometimes called the backbone of Puglia, with
  remarkable agricultural biodiversity, including 40 local varieties of almonds,
  including tondino cegliese. Like many visitors to the area, we bought a packet
  of biscotti di ceglie from a bakery in Ceglie Messapica, although this was
  years ago, when the band my partner plays with toured in Puglia every summer
  and when we consumed every regional treat in a claustrophobic Fiat van. Unlike
  the great fig roll, however, the pastry for these biscuits is made from
  toasted almonds, sugar and honey, and includes lemon zest and a citrus essence
  liqueur called rosolio di agrumi; the jam, meanwhile, is typically cherry, but
  can also be grape. Made for hundreds of years, and a sort of symbol of the
  town, the biscuits are recognised by the Slow Food Foundation, whose many Slow
  Food Presidia protect traditional and artisanal products that are at risk of
  disappearing, as well as help producers access a fairer market. Together with
  local producers, the regional consortium specifies what is to be considered an
  original biscotto di Ceglie Messapica – so that all the ingredients must come
  from the countryside around Ceglie itself. A local consorzio has laid out a
  fantastically detailed set of instructions, specifying quantities (every 1kg
  almonds should be mixed with 300g sugar, 50g honey, 10ml liqueur, three to
  four eggs and the zest of a lemon) and describing the procedure in great
  detail. All this to say, this week’s recipe is not the original biscotti di
  Ceglie Messapica, but it is inspired by them and, I hope, respectful. If you
  have ever made soft amaretti, pasticcini di mandorle or ricciarelli, the idea
  is the same: ground almonds, sugar and eggs are made into a soft dough that is
  then shaped and baked. The great difference here, however, is that it is
  shaped into a log, which is then cut. I discovered with my first batch just
  how important very thick jam is – and how quickly jam burns! In fact, for my
  second batch, I reduced the jam for just a few minutes, and for my third batch
  I used well-drained cherries preserved in syrup, instead, which make for a
  very neat filling, although they make the biscuits harder to cut. (Use the
  drained syrup to make a drink with fizzy water and lots of ice.) Once baked,
  these biscuits will be quite soft for some time, so leave them to cool a
  little or use a spatula to move them very carefully from the baking tray to a
  rack. Another similarity with fig rolls is how close these tender biscuits are
  to being a small cake, and they also remind me of bakewell tart, which are
  both good things. Almond and cherry biscuits Makes About 20 150g blanched
  almonds, or almond flour 150g toasted almonds (peeled or unpeeled) 100g caster
  sugar 1 tbsp honey 1 egg Finely grated zest of 1 small unwaxed lemon 100g
  thick cherry jam, or well drained cherries in syrup Working in a food
  processor, pulse the blanched and toasted almonds into a fine flour, then tip
  into a bowl and add the sugar, honey, egg and lemon zest, and bring together
  into a firm dough. Working on a piece of greaseproof paper, press or roll the
  dough into a rectangular strip about 40cm long x 12cm wide x 1½cm deep.
  Carefully spread the jam or cherries in a line along the centre of the dough,
  then bring in both edges to form a log. Roll gently so it extends slightly,
  and pinch the edges to close. Cut the log into slices about 2-3cm wide, put on
  a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper, and bake at 170C (150C
  fan)/340F/gas 3½ for 15-20 minutes, until lightly golden.
