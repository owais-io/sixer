  By housing asylum seekers in groups, the government makes them easy targets
  for the Farage-fuelled thugs (Editorial, 20 August). When Ukrainian refugees
  were brought to the UK, they were housed with host families and thus had a
  chance to lead something like a normal life here. Why not do the same with
  asylum seekers? Not all of us are xenophobes, and many people with rooms
  available would be willing to accommodate a vulnerable person or family while
  their applications are processed. This would give them a chance to acclimatise
  to their new environment and allow them to be treated with dignity and
  compassion. Brenda Hall Bryn Saith Marchog, Denbighshire • The government’s
  recent difficulty over hotels for asylum seekers (Labour plans in turmoil
  after Epping hotel blocked from housing asylum seekers, 19 August) is an
  opportunity to revive and update the Homes for Ukraine idea, but for refugees
  from Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea etc. There are charities all over the country
  that already facilitate this, but government support, and money, would enable
  rapid expansion of community hosting. Roger van Schaick Nottingham • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
