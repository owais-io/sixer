  Dozens of immigrant workers were detained at a warehouse in New Jersey on
  Wednesday, in the latest federal raid as part of Donald Trump’s immigration
  crackdown. Agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) descended on the
  warehouse, in Edison, New Jersey, at 9am on Wednesday, the New York Times
  reported. Officers led some workers away in zip ties, employees told the
  Times, while people they deemed to have legal status in the US were given
  yellow wristbands. Univision reported that the agents spent hours at the
  facility, during what CBP said was a “surprise inspection”. CBP told Univision
  the operation had begun as part of “routine efforts” to verify customs,
  employment and safety regulations. CBP did not immediately respond to
  questions from the Guardian. Videos taken by New Labor, a New Jersey-based
  labor and immigration reform organization, showed CBP vehicles at the site,
  along with unmarked SUVs. New Labor said Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (Ice) agents were also at the raid. “We have customs and border patrol [sic]
  holding the door open for their Ice counterparts to say they’re allowed in
  with us, and then they start doing immigration-related actions,” Amanda
  Dominguez, an organizer at New Labor, told News 12 New York. “That is illegal.
  Ice still needs their own judicial warrant signed by a judge.” Relatives of
  the workers gathered at the facility throughout the day, the Times reported,
  waiting for news about people inside. “People were very upset and crying and
  angry, completely understandably,” said Ellen Whit, who works at Deportation
  &amp; Immigrant Response Equipo (Dire), a New Jersey hotline that responds to
  calls about raids and from relatives of immigrants who have been detained,
  told the Times. “One girl’s father was taken. She was very, very upset.”
  Workers described a chaotic scene as federal agents arrived. About 20 agents
  entered through the front door of the warehouse, witnesses told the Times,
  while other agents blocked alternative exits. Some people were injured amid
  the chaos, while others hid in the rafters of the warehouse for hours in an
  attempt to avoid the officers. The raid comes weeks after 20 people were taken
  into custody by Ice at the Alba Wine and Spirits warehouse in Edison.
  Activists told Fox 5 NY that masked Ice agents arrived that the warehouse in
  30 cars, with dogs. Phil Murphy, the Democratic governor of New Jersey, said
  after the Alba raid, according to NJ Spotlight News: “We don’t stand in the
  way of federal authorities doing their work and [we are] cooperating with them
  all the time. But beyond that, I have no insight into the Edison situation.”
