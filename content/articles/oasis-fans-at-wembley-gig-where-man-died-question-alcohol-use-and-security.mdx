  Oasis fans who witnessed a fatal fall at Wembley during a reunion concert on
  Saturday have questioned the security setup and the amount of alcohol being
  consumed in the stands. The Metropolitan police said a man in his 40s died
  after suffering injuries consistent with a fall at the end of the band’s
  performance at about 10.19pm on Saturday night. On Monday, the Met announced
  that the Health and Safety Executive, the body which investigates accidents,
  had been informed. Witnesses who were 3 metres (10ft) from where the man
  landed said he fell from the upper tier of Wembley’s block 511, on to the
  aisle between block 211 and block 210. Emma, 40, from Liverpool, said the man
  landed next to a row behind her and her partner, Mike, only five seats away.
  “I’ve been feeling awful ever since – I can’t stop thinking about him,” she
  said. “It happened directly behind our right shoulders. If he had fallen where
  someone was sitting, it would have killed both people.” Within seconds of the
  fall, several staff began trying to perform CPR on the man. Mike said: “It’s
  quite traumatic, seeing people just doing CPR on someone frantically. I
  haven’t been able to focus on anything else.” Emma and Mike, who declined to
  give their full names, urged Wembley to review safety and alcohol sales at the
  stadium. Emma said: “So much beer was being thrown throughout the whole
  concert. I was surprised they allowed people to bring drinks into the stands.
  It made the floor really slippy.” She added: “They should put the security
  guard at the bottom of all the aisles too, and permanently station them there
  to stop people falling off.” Mike, who works in health and safety, said: “Beer
  was coming from everywhere. I got hit by an empty cup right on the side of the
  head. If it had been full it would really have hurt. We started getting beer
  on us from the moment Oasis came on stage.” John, 52, a delivery driver from
  Oxford who also declined to give his full name, saw many fans leaning over the
  balcony from block 511. He said: “There were loads of people who just kept
  going down to the front and leaning right over. One guy was stopped but after
  that no security came down. The security was so lax. There’s a rail and a
  small guard but it did make me think someone could quite easily get knocked
  off there.” John added: “It seemed unsafe. If they’d have actually posted a
  security guard at the bottom of those steps, where people were continually
  going, it would have prevented the fall.” He was also surprised by the level
  of drinking at the gig. “The amount of alcohol that was sold on the night was
  quite shocking. I constantly saw people with cardboard cup holders full of
  pints,” John said. Last week the Times revealed that Oasis fans were consuming
  an average of 250,000 pints a night during the Wembley gigs. A Wembley Stadium
  spokesperson said: “Wembley Stadium operates to a very high health and safety
  standard, fully meeting legal requirements for the safety of spectators and
  staff, and is certified to and compliant with the ISO 45001 standard. “We work
  very closely and collaboratively with all relevant event delivery stakeholders
  – including event owners, local authorities, the Sports Ground Safety
  Authority and the police – to deliver events to high standards of safety,
  security and service for everyone attending or working in the venue.”
  Saturday’s concert was the fourth of seven sold-out reunion gigs at Wembley.
  Despite the tragedy on Saturday, the fifth gig on Sunday went ahead as
  planned. The sixth and seventh gigs will be in September.
