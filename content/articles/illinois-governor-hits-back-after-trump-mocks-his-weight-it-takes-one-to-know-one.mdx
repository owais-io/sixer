  The Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, has hit back at Donald Trump
  for commenting on his weight, saying the Republican president is himself “not
  in good shape” amid escalating tension over the possible deployment of the
  national guard on the streets of Chicago. Trump said on Monday that Pritzker
  “ought to spend more time in the gym”. While successfully campaigning in 2024
  for a second presidency that began in January, Trump said that the Illinois
  governor was “too busy eating” to lead his state. The president – at a listed
  6ft 3in tall – is a devotee of fast food, and his annual physical in April
  cited a weight of 224 pounds. Boasting a listed weight and height that is
  about three pounds lighter and as tall as those listed in July for the
  undisputed heavyweight boxing champion, Oleksandr Usyk, Trump has made several
  personal attacks based on physical appearance in the past, with his targets
  including the comedian Rosie O’Donnell and former New Jersey governor Chris
  Christie. But Pritzker responded forcefully to Trump’s scorn, telling
  reporters that: “It takes one to know one on the weight question. And the
  president, of course, himself, is not in good shape. So, he ought to respond
  to that from me.” Pritzker added Trump does not read and only watches
  television – so the governor called upon Fox News or Newsmax to relay his
  comments to the president. “I would say also that his personal attacks on me
  are just evidence of a guy who’s still living in fifth grade,” Pritzker said.
  “He’s the kind of bully that throws invectives at people – because he knows
  that what he’s saying is actually commentary on himself.” The traded insults
  between the two politicians come as Trump considers whether to federalize the
  national guard and deploy it upon the streets of Chicago to combat what he
  portrays as a crime wave in the city. Leaders of Chicago and Illinois have
  said such a move would be unnecessary overreach. The president has already
  sent the national guard into Los Angeles and Washington DC. On Monday, Trump
  said he might wait for Pritzker to ask for the national guard to be deployed,
  as is the norm, but may do so unilaterally using powers meant to be used in
  extreme emergencies. “Chicago, everybody knows how bad it is,” Trump said.
  “Everybody standing there knows. We know. You don’t have to be doing any
  studies. They should be saying, ‘Please, come in.’” Trump, who said that
  Chicago is a “killing field right now” addressed criticism that he is acting
  in an overly authoritarian way. “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we’d like
  a dictator,’” the president said. “I don’t like a dictator. I’m not a
  dictator.” The White House has said that Chicago has a severe crime problem,
  pointing out that it suffered 573 murders in 2024, the highest of any US city.
  However, this total represents the lowest number of homicides in the city
  since 2019 and so far this year crime is down significantly compared with
  2024. Similarly, in 2024, Washington DC had registered its lowest crime rate
  in 30 years before Trump deployed the military in the nation’s capital. “Do
  not come to Chicago, you are neither wanted here nor needed here,” Pritzker
  said on Monday. “Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a US city to
  punish its dissidents and score political points. If this were happening in
  any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is - a
  dangerous power-grab.”
