  According to Peter Hain, “the approach to Palestine Action is contrary to
  every form of peaceful protest in British history, whether that’s the
  Chartists and suffragettes or anti-apartheid and anti-fascist protesters”
  (Peter Hain says UK government ‘digging itself into hole’ over Palestine
  Action, 13 August). Mr Hain, I’m afraid, needs to return to his history books.
  Describing those radical and sometimes violent movements as “peaceful protest”
  domesticates them and ignores the role that street fighting and property
  damage (for example) have played in successful protest in the past. From
  attempted armed uprisings, through bombings of cricket pavilions and churches,
  to Cable Street and elsewhere, those examples he gives of “peaceful protest”
  saw activists exercise violent resistance. Furthermore, the repression of
  Palestine Action and those protesting against its repression is very much not
  contrary to approaches to past protest movements. Excessive action through
  police and courts, and violent repression from the British state, have been
  common. From transportation (and sometimes execution) of early reformers,
  through the force-feeding of imprisoned suffrage activists, to the beating to
  death of Blair Peach by police officers, the state has often responded to
  serious challenges to its authority in ways that defy reason, and used the
  criminal justice system to do so. Mr Hain is repeating a longstanding liberal
  story that seeks to domesticate radicalism. It’s the story of a reasonable
  people interacting with reasonable governments to ensure slow and steady
  progress. Unfortunately, it is a story that runs contrary to historical (and
  present) reality. Mark Nixon Blackford, Perth and Kinross • As a 57-year-old
  participant in the 9 August Palestine Action protest, I find the tone of
  slightly surprised celebration of older participants to be rather patronising.
  There’s nothing exceptional about older people’s participation in political
  refusal, and I’m not up for the kind of argument that things must really be
  bad if old white women are coming out to protest in force. Older people –
  black, brown and white – have been central to civil disobedience as long as
  there has been protest. So while of course there will have been many people at
  the 9 August protest who were facing arrest for the first time, there were
  also many seasoned activists who were there in solidarity, in leadership and
  in persistent refusal to accept state curtailment of rights. These solidarity
  politics, which were beautifully in evidence among those waiting for arrest
  with their placards, come from feminist, queer and anti-racist histories of
  organising, solidarity and ethics that older people inaugurated. Today’s
  protests are possible because of the refusal of people to keep quiet about
  poverty and inequality, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia over many
  years. They are possible because of the risks that organisers have taken that
  have challenged police brutality and the hierarchies of social justice that
  prevent a full life – including freedom of expression – for all. People over
  50 will continue to show up as long as there is public space to occupy. Clare
  Hemmings London • What would happen if people wishing to demonstrate against
  the outlawing of Palestine Action carried banners emblazoned with the words
  “inept escalation” – a description of the government’s legislation that
  happens to be an anagram of the banned organisation’s name (Protester arrested
  over ‘Plasticine Action’ T-shirt: ‘How ridiculous is this?’, 18 August)?
