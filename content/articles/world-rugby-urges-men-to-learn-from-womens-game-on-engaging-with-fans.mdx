  The head of World Rugby has urged the men’s game to learn lessons from how
  players at the Women’s Rugby World Cup have shown off their personalities and
  interacted more with fans. Alan Gilpin also suggested that World Rugby would
  be preparing a dossier of “great facts and stats” to show teams at the men’s
  World Cup in 2027 that engaging more with supporters would not take the edge
  off their performances. “Perceptions about our sport are being challenged, are
  being changed, and, in many cases, are being blown out of the water,” said
  Gilpin. “And we believe there’s a real opportunity for the men’s game to
  actually follow the lead. We’re seeing greater accessibility and more
  personality creates more stars.” Players have been posing for selfies, signing
  autographs and, in the case of Japan, even bowing to the crowd to show their
  support. Gilpin insisted that it was making a huge difference to the vibe of
  the tournament with 90% of fans – many of whom had never been to a rugby game
  before – saying they would return. “I’ve been involved in a lot of Rugby World
  Cups,” said Gilpin. “I don’t think I’ve been involved in one with an
  atmosphere quite like this.” “Whether it’s the dancing between the teams after
  a match, the interaction with fans after the final whistle or their engagement
  individually on social media, it is a genie you can’t put back very easily in
  the bottle. “I hope that we continue to see that in the women’s game. And I
  hope that in the men’s game there’s some lessons or observations made of that.
  That it doesn’t have to be a performance inhibitor. If something is engaging
  fans, and creating joy for the players, maybe it’s something that can actually
  be a performance enablement. “When we get to the end of the tournament we’ll
  have some great content, some great facts and stats to really share as we look
  forward to the men’s edition in Australia in 2027.” World Rugby also confirmed
  that four of the final group games this weekend were expected to be sold out,
  but conceded that the attention the tournament has received had led to some
  players being trolled on social media. One of those affected, the Wales No 8
  Georgia Evans, insisted that the abuse would not lead to her changing
  appearance, which includes wearing ribbons in her hair and make-up during
  matches. “In an old-school, man’s game, I’m bringing a bit of Barbie to the
  party,” she said in an Instagram post. “To those who don’t like it, that’s OK.
  To those who’ve shown love and support – thank you. Don’t worry, I won’t be
  changing. “The bows in my hair, the tape on my arm, the eyelashes and full
  face of make-up I choose to wear – none of that affects my ability, passion,
  or fight for this game.” Yvonne Nolan, the competition director for the
  Women’s Rugby World Cup, said that they were using the AI service from Signify
  to weed out abuse and highlight the worst cases. “Unfortunately this is a
  societal issue, and unprecedented attention unfortunately brings some
  negatives with it,” she added. “We don’t accept it, we don’t tolerate it, and
  we will take action where we can.” Meanwhile Nicky Ponsford, director of high
  performance at World Rugby, said that the statistics showed that the women’s
  game was improving, with more action and less errors in the 2025 tournament
  compared to three years ago. “Bear in mind, we’ve increased from 12 to 16
  teams. But we’re still seeing significant increases in performance. We’re
  seeing 22 more passes per match, so the quality of handling is improving, with
  three fewer knock-ons. There have also been 11 more rucks per match, three
  more kicks and three more tries per match.”
