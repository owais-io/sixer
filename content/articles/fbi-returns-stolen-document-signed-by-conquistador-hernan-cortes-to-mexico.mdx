  Nearly five centuries after Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés signed it and
  decades after someone swiped it from national archives, a priceless manuscript
  page has been returned by the FBI to Mexico. The document contains a detailed
  accounting of the logistics related to Cortés’s journey to what eventually
  became New Spain – a territory that stretched from Central America to
  modern-day Washington state. “This is an original manuscript page that was
  actually signed by Hernán Cortés,” said special agent Jessica Dittmer, a
  member of the FBI’s art crime team in New York. “Pieces like this are
  considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in
  Mexico’s history.” Cortés landed in Mexico with a small army in 1519, when he
  formed alliances with local groups that opposed the Aztec empire, which helped
  him capture the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán – modern-day Mexico City – just
  two years later. The document is dated 20 February 1527, just days before one
  of Cortés’s top lieutenants was appointed co-governor of the conquered
  territory. It was a key year for the formation of royal and religious
  institutions that would rule over the Indigenous peoples of Mexico until its
  1810-21 war of independence. The manuscript was initially stored in Mexico’s
  national archives, but archivists microfilming the collection in 1993 found
  that 15 pages had gone missing. Based on its wax numbering system, the FBI
  said the document was probably stolen between 1985 and 1993. Mexico requested
  the help of the FBI’s art crime team last year for this particular page.
  Investigators eventually narrowed the search to the United States and located
  the document, though the agency did not say who had it. The New York City
  police department, US Department of Justice and Mexico’s government were all
  involved in the investigation. Because the document has changed hands various
  times over the years, no one will be charged for the theft, the FBI said. It
  is the second Cortés document the FBI has returned to the Mexican government.
  In 2023, the agency returned a 16th-century letter from Cortés. “Pieces like
  this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments
  in Mexico’s history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their
  archives for the purpose of understanding history better,” she said.
