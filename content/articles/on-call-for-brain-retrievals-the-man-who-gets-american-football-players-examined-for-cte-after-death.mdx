  Shortly after news broke that a shooter had breached the New York City
  skyscraper where the NFL is headquartered and killed four people before
  turning the gun on himself, Chris Nowinski was called to duty. A former
  Harvard football player and professional wrestler turned neuroscientist,
  Nowinski helped establish the Unite Brain Bank at Boston University. It is the
  world’s largest repository of brain samples dedicated to the study of CTE – or
  chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive neurodegenerative disease
  linked to repetitive hits to the head and concussions. Some 1,600 brains have
  been examined there, with Nowinski helping to facilitate donations. In his
  suicide note, 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas asked for his brain to be
  studied for CTE, which can only be diagnosed posthumously. Tamura was a former
  high school football player, and he claimed the sport gave him the incurable
  brain injury. Nowinski is following the case closely, preparing for the
  possibility that BU might acquire Tamura’s brain. While he and the general
  public awaits the results of the New York medical examiners office’s criminal
  autopsy (the office declined to provide a timeline), he spoke with the
  Guardian about how the Brain Bank procures former athletes’ brains and what
  the NFL did to make the uproar around CTE go away. What was your initial
  reaction to the news? It was very troubling to learn about his suicide note.
  He clearly understood some aspects of the concussion and CTE discussion. But
  with what he did, he was not of sound mind, so you wonder if this was
  something that he latched on to as part of his psychosis. How would you
  categorize Tamura’s case? At least from a violence standpoint, it feels like
  it belongs on the same spectrum with Phillip Adams and Aaron Hernandez – both
  former NFL players who committed murder before killing themselves. We’ve seen
  this enough over the years to know there are three categories: there’s a
  chance that there’s no pathological brain damage, that this has nothing to do
  with any history of playing football. There’s a chance this has nothing to do
  with CTE, but he did take enough hits that he suffered concussions or
  subclinical traumatic brain injury that contributed to his symptoms, and that
  those symptoms contributed to his actions. And then there’s the chance that he
  had CTE – and then that sort of splits into, did he have enough CTE where we
  might think it contributed to his actions or not? You helped establish the
  Unite Brain Bank at Boston University, where the bulk of CTE research is
  conducted. What does the process of pursuing a brain for science look like? We
  don’t usually go into specifics, but what I can tell you is that my job is to
  track down cases that are of public interest – and this case certainly
  qualifies. In a case like this where there’s an ongoing investigation, the
  brain is basically under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner. It’s their
  call whether or not it’s studied and whether it’s studied in-house or
  externally. But I also know the people involved with the New York City medical
  examiner’s office have a tremendous reputation and tremendous capabilities
  internally, so there’s no concern that [Tamura’s] brain won’t be studied. What
  happens to the deceased after a criminal investigation has concluded? Like in
  the case of Hernandez, who died in penal custody? There is a time when the
  investigation is over that, in theory, the brain tissue then becomes property
  of the family. How does one go about convincing a family to make a donation to
  the Brain Bank, especially in tragic situations such as Tamura’s or
  Hernandez’s? At this stage, after 1,600 brains, one thing our team all agrees
  upon is that there’s no case so important [as] to upset a family. If they’re
  not comfortable or on the fence, they’re never pressured. We offer it as an
  opportunity if they want to. What can the process of donating a brain look
  like for most families? Most will call the 24-hour Boston University CTE
  center hotline. The person who responds to the call usually has a network of
  medical experts across the country who are essentially on call for brain
  retrievals. They coordinate when the brain retrieval will occur – could be at
  a hospital or a funeral home. The expert procures the brain and then either a
  courier is hired to fly it to Boston or it will be [preserved] for weeks to
  harden and then transferred to Boston. BU says online that it’s able to make
  extractions while also allowing for families to have open-casket funerals.
  How? The person retrieving the brain goes through the back of the skull. Ten
  years ago, football’s CTE crisis was headline news and an inescapable
  controversy for the NFL. Why did the outrage recede? I’ll give you three
  insights: one is that when the NFL stopped denying the game caused CTE, it
  took some of the energy out. It stopped there being a clear bad guy in the
  story. Two is the sports industry has benefited from the fracturing of media.
  There just aren’t that many full-time investigative journalists in sports
  anymore. Then point three is you can’t get this issue on television anymore,
  and that’s primarily because the NFL has now given a game to every media
  platform. It’s not even a well-kept secret that anybody who carries game
  broadcasts is very concerned about [not calling attention to] CTE in the NFL.
  [Days after this interview, the NFL announced it had bought a 10% stake in
  ESPN.] I can remember there being some urgency to establish a link between CTE
  and violence – but all the research at the time was inconclusive. Has anything
  changed? I still wouldn’t say there’s been a definitive study. Frankly, it’s
  very difficult to answer the question of CTE and violence through Brain Bank
  studies, because the data it produces comes from talking to families [after
  the subject dies]. It is true that a larger proportion of men with CTE than
  you would like had become violent with loved ones. But it’s difficult to study
  the appearance and disappearance of the violence in part because a lot of
  people with CTE became violent midlife and then less so as dementia set in. So
  that will need to be studied longitudinally. But if you ask me: am I aware of
  people [who played contact sports] who are considered the nicest guys in the
  world suddenly in their 50s and 60s becoming violent with their loved ones? I
  have a lot of those stories. The NFL is quite proud of the rules changes they
  have enacted to make pro football safer – and to its credit the updates have
  taken a lot of hits out of the game. But what about the levels below, like
  college and high school? Can we point to a reduction in potential brain
  injuries? Firstly, the NFL had to take the brain injury risk seriously because
  there’s a [players] union. But that doesn’t exist in college. We did an
  editorial recently to accompany a study that showed basically that 80% of the
  NFL’s concussions are in games; in college, it’s 30% [meaning the overwhelming
  majority happen during practice]. The editorial laid out how the NFL set the
  tone 10 years ago by virtually eliminating hits in practice. The reality is
  I’m glad the NFL has started making some stronger changes – most recently, to
  kickoff procedures. No one was dying for that, but now we’re all fine with it.
  But the sad part is the other levels aren’t copying the NFL. Like, how is the
  NFL proving that it’s safer, but college and high school football aren’t even
  talking about it? In high school, apart from two states that have severe
  limits, everybody else has pretty loose limits, no monitoring and no
  penalties. I’m having that battle on a daily basis to warn athletes,
  especially the ones who are old enough to understand, that they’re not being
  warned and their coaches are not properly educated on CTE. So for all the good
  things that have happened, slowly progressing the discussion, we should not
  expect CTE to go down. We’re still creating the same problem; we just feel
  better about it. Personally, it always rankles me to hear announcers complain
  about roughness penalties that strike them as overzealous. Then you realize
  safety is an afterthought to the business – that if the changes are too
  radical and fans turn off the TV, the hitting comes back. And I don’t have a
  problem with that at the NFL level. Players get half the revenue, so they can
  have that discussion about how safe they want it to be. But we also have to
  educate the fans to allow it to be safer. The one place where that’s actually
  happened is professional wrestling. Now that fans understand the risks, they
  want matches to be stopped when people have concussions. Even now you see
  wrestling fans struggle to play back old matches because it’s so obvious how
  dazed some of those guys were in the ring. I had that discussion with a
  25-year-old who works for a sports organization in the brain health space who
  was like, “I watched some matches from your era. What the hell were you guys
  doing?” So, we could educate NFL fans too to enjoy a slightly safer game. But
  who wants to be reminded that many of the guys they’re watching already have
  CTE? Given that the NYC shooting happened during NFL training camps, I was
  surprised that players didn’t have more to say about it. Current NFL players
  don’t talk about CTE because many of them don’t understand it and others know
  they’ll be punished if they do. I mean, let’s be honest: Jerry Jones [owner of
  the Dallas Cowboys] is still on the record saying he doesn’t believe that
  football causes CTE even though he’s lost a teammate from Arkansas to it. So
  if you play for the Cowboys and start talking about CTE, I wouldn’t be
  surprised if he cut you the next day. Ten years ago there was a lot of talk
  about the need for a test to detect CTE in the living. Are we any closer to
  that? Yes. We’ve learned tau Pet scans for Alzheimer’s disease don’t work. But
  we have identified targets we think might make it diagnosable from blood, and
  we are trying two more new tau Pet tracers that people are hopeful might work
  for CTE. Interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
