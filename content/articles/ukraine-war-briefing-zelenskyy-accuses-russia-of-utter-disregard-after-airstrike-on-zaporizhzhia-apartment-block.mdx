  Russia launched a sweeping attack across Ukraine overnight on Saturday, with
  one person killed and 24 injured, including three children, when a five-storey
  residential building was hit in Zaporizhzhia. The regional governor, Ivan
  Fedorov, said the attack on Zaporizhzhia cut power to 25,000 residents. The
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on X “Russians launched nearly
  540 drones, 8 ballistic missiles, and 37 other types of missiles against
  civilian life”. He said 14 regions were targeted, including Kyiv and
  Chernivtsi in the south-west of the country bordering Romania. The Ukrainian
  air force said it had downed 510 of 537 drones and 38 of 45 missiles launched
  by Russia in the overnight attack. It recorded five missile and 24 drone hits
  at seven locations, according to its statement on Telegram. Russia confirmed
  it had launched the attacks, saying they were against “military” targets. The
  cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk also
  came under attack early on Saturday, causing fires, the regional governor,
  Sergiy Lysak, wrote on Telegram, warning residents to take cover. Zelenskyy
  accused Moscow of using “the time meant for preparing a leaders-level meeting
  to organise new massive attacks” and called for “tougher” banking and energy
  sanctions on Russia. He said Russia’s latest attack had shown “its utter
  disregard for words”. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she had
  asked the bloc’s governments to submit proposals next week for another package
  of sanctions against Russia after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in
  Copenhagen. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said he expected that
  Russia would only stop its war against Ukraine once it could no longer wage it
  for economic and military reasons, given that diplomatic efforts in recent
  weeks had failed. “All efforts of the past weeks have been answered with an
  even more aggressive approach by this regime in Moscow against the population
  in Ukraine,” Merz said at a regional event in North Rhine-Westphalia on
  Saturday. “This will also not stop until we ensure together that Russia, at
  least for economic reasons, and perhaps also for military reasons can no
  longer continue this war.” The chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery
  Gerasimov, said on Saturday that Russian forces were waging non-stop
  offensives along the entire frontline in Ukraine and have the “strategic
  initiative”. Since March, Russia has captured more than 3,500 sq km of
  territory in Ukraine and taken control of 149 villages, Gerasimov added. “At
  present, the strategic initiative lies entirely with Russian forces,” he
  asserted. Russian troops have taken control of the village of Komyshuvakha in
  Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the Russian defence ministry said, adding
  that its forces had successfully carried out strikes with high-precision
  weapons on Ukrainian missile and aviation enterprises, as well as military
  airfields in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said that it had struck Russian
  oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight. The military recorded
  multiple explosions and a fire at the Krasnodar oil refinery in Russia’s south
  and said there was also a fire in the Syzran oil refinery area in Samara
  region. Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged one
  of the refinery’s units. Twenty Ukrainian drones, including 18 over
  Russian-annexed Crimea, were shot down early on Saturday morning, the Russian
  defence ministry said. The other two drones were shot down over Russia’s
  western Smolensk region. Andriy Parubiy, a Ukrainian politician who previously
  served as the parliament speaker, was shot dead in western city of Lviv on
  Saturday. Prosecutors have opened a murder investigation and said police were
  still searching for the shooter but have not mentioned possible motives at
  this stage. Zelenskyy said the shooting was “carefully planned” and that “all
  necessary forces and means” would be used in the investigation. The foreign
  minister, Andrii Sybiha, described Parubiy as “a patriot and statesman” who
  “rightfully belongs in the history books”, while the prime minister, Yulia
  Svyrydenko, called for a prompt investigation of the murder, calling it “a
  profound loss” for the country.
