  Rachel Reeves is in favour of radical tax reform – or at least she was in
  2018. “We need a radical overhaul of the tax system because our current system
  of wealth taxation isn’t working,” she argued in her pamphlet The Everyday
  Economy. Seven years later, in her second year as chancellor, Reeves appears
  to be returning to some of the themes in that pamphlet, especially as it
  relates to the UK’s convoluted and unpopular system of taxing property. The
  Guardian revealed on Monday the chancellor was considering scrapping stamp
  duty (used in England and Northern Ireland) and replacing it with an annual
  levy based on the value of someone’s home and the time they bought it. On
  Tuesday, the Times reported that Reeves was also considering imposing the
  UK-wide capital gains tax on higher-value primary properties, even though the
  prime minister, Keir Starmer, ruled out doing so before the election. All this
  is part of what officials say is a wider examination of the UK’s property tax
  system, which experts argue could be simplified and improved while also
  raising money to help fill Reeves’ £20bn fiscal black hole. “Reeves is so
  desperate to find money she is flying every kite going [floating policy
  suggestions] to see which ones get knocked down,” said Tim Leunig, an
  economist whose work Treasury officials have been studying. “But there are
  important reasons to change the way our property taxes work, especially if you
  want to raise serious money.” Politicians have long looked at inflated
  property prices in parts of the UK and wondered how to squeeze more money from
  them. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat former business secretary, proposed a
  mansion tax in 2009 that would have taxed properties worth more than £1m at
  0.5%. The plan was dropped when his party entered government and faced
  opposition from their Conservative coalition partners. The idea was taken up
  by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband, who claimed in the 2015 election
  campaign that the policy would raise £1.2bn a year. Until recently, Treasury
  officials have scoffed at the idea of anything resembling a mansion tax,
  saying it would encourage wealthy people to move abroad. But they admit the
  UK’s property taxation system is riddled with problems. An obvious one is
  stamp duty, which is a one-off lump sum charged to people when they buy a new
  property, set at different rates according to the value of the property up to
  a maximum of 12% for properties worth more than £1.5m. The problem with such a
  charge is that it disincentivises property purchases, slowing the economy, and
  reducing the turnover of new properties. Leunig has suggested instead that
  property owners pay a smaller annual amount based on the purchase price of the
  home, payable in perpetuity. A rate of 0.54% with an additional supplement for
  properties worth more than £1m would raise the same amount as stamp duty does.
  A higher rate, or temptingly for the chancellor, a bigger supplement, could
  raise far more. Such a system would help those who move frequently, but
  penalise those who stay in their homes for a long time. Leunig argues this
  would incentivise people to move into smaller, cheaper properties towards the
  end of their lives, freeing up larger stock for younger families. Another
  problem which many have identified is with council tax, which is both
  unpopular and messy, with rates based on property valuations from 1991.
  Successive government have shied away from a full revaluation, which would
  create millions of losers, but Leunig has suggested levying a new charge only
  on properties worth less than £500,000 – with those over that threshold being
  covered by the replacement for stamp duty. While officials are looking into
  potential changes to council tax, this is likely only to come in if Labour
  wins a second term in office. Ministers are aware that polls suggest raising
  council tax would be one of the most controversial options they have. A third
  problem comes with capital gains tax, which is charged at a rate far below
  income tax. Officials are now looking at whether to levy CGT on primary
  properties for the first time, albeit only over a particular threshold. There
  are two problems with doing this, however. One is that Starmer explicitly
  promised not to before the election. And the other is that it would prove a
  major disincentive for people to move out of larger properties. “No other
  countries does this without some form of exemption or rollover which allows
  sellers to pay it much later down the line,” said Ben Hopkinson, the head of
  housing at the Centre for Policy Studies. There is one further problem for the
  chancellor: British property is already more heavily taxed than that in most
  other countries. According to the OECD, the UK takes in more property tax as a
  share of its gross domestic product than any other developed economy.
  “Property is inherently difficult to tax,” said Leunig. “But we still manage
  to do so – at a rate three times higher than Germany.”
