  Adjapsandal is one of my favourite Georgian go-tos, no matter the season. Its
  more traditional form is broody and stewy, designed to burble away on a winter
  stove a bit like ratatouille, but with more fresh herbs. In summer, while the
  barbecue’s on and veg dishes of this kind are va-va-voom, it makes sense to
  just chuck them on the barbie instead and perhaps team with a spicy shortcut
  adjika paste using a jar of roast peppers. And, second, a very adaptable
  carpaccio for any firm fruit in your fridge or fruit bowl: melons, stone fruit
  – heck, even pineapple! The key is to use a sharp knife and slice against the
  grain for the best mouthfeel, much as you might sashimi. Barbecued adjapsandal
  with adjika yoghurt dressing (pictured top) Piquillo peppers work best here,
  if you can find them, but you can use the ones from the deli counter, too,
  though maybe add a splash more red-wine vinegar to balance the acidity,
  tasting as you go. If it’s not barbecue weather, you could also cook this
  indoors on a griddle – just make sure to get it smoking hot and open a window.
  Prep 15 min Cook 40 min Serves 4-6 1 large or 2 medium aubergine (about 500g),
  cut into 1cm-thick discs 2 large courgettes (about 400g), cut into 1cm-thick
  discs 1 large red onion (about 250g), peeled and cut into 1cm-thick rings 4
  large tomatoes (about 400g), quartered vertically 60ml extra-virgin olive oil,
  plus extra for brushing For the adjika 4 garlic cloves 40g sun-dried tomatoes,
  drained 250g drained piquillo peppers ¼ tsp mild chilli flakes 15g coriander
  sprigs, leaves picked and reserved to garnish 15g parsley, stems and leaves
  15g holy basil, or Thai or young regular basil leaves, plus extra to garnish
  30ml neutral oil – I use sunflower or grapeseed 1 tsp ground fenugreek 1 tsp
  ground coriander 1 tsp salt flakes ½ tsp sugar ¼ tsp ground black pepper To
  finish 230g natural yoghurt Heat a barbecue or grill plate until smoking. Pop
  the sliced aubergine and courgette on a baking tray and put the onion and
  tomato on another. Brush the aubergine generously with olive oil (or use an
  oil spray); the courgette doesn’t need as much oil, because the residual oil
  left on the grill by the aubergines will be plenty. Lay the aubergines on the
  open grill side of the barbecue for 10–15 minutes, turning halfway, until
  cooked through and with defined char marks (more is more with aubergine,
  really). Transfer the cooked slices to the upper rack to keep warm (if you
  don’t have an upper rack, pop them back on the tray and cover loosely with
  foil). Next, grill the courgette slices for six to eight minutes, flipping
  them over halfway. Repeat with the tomatoes and onion, until they are slightly
  blackened and blistered and seeping out juice. As each vegetable is cooked,
  introduce them to the aubergines on the upper rack (or in the loosely covered
  tray) to keep warm. For the adjika, put everything in a small blender and
  whizz smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper. When you’re ready to
  serve, dot blobs of the adjika and the yoghurt all over a large platter, then
  use a flexible spatula or the back of a spoon to smear them into a marbled
  pattern. Arrange all the warm grilled vegetables on top, then finish with
  extra olive oil, the reserved coriander leaves and extra basil leaves.
  Honeydew carpaccio with coriander pesto Some people don’t like coriander
  (they’re wrong), but you could use basil to make the pesto instead; if need
  be, it could easily be made days in advance and loosened with extra oil. Serve
  chilled on a hot summer’s day. Prep 15 min Cook 15 min Serves 4-6 200g yellow
  cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced 250g baby cucumbers, thinly sliced into rounds
  1 tbsp lime juice 1 perfectly ripe honeydew melon (about 1.2 kg), peeled and
  sliced into thin half-moons For the coriander pesto 25g fresh coriander,
  prettier sprigs reserved to garnish 40g salted roasted peanuts 30g baby
  spinach leaves, refreshed in chilled water 125ml neutral oil – I use peanut or
  rice bran 1 garlic clove, peeled ½ tbsp fish sauce ½ tbsp sesame oil Finely
  grated zest and juice of 1 lime ½ tsp sugar ½ tsp salt 1 pinch cracked black
  pepper To finish 1 long green chilli, flesh finely sliced 40g salted roasted
  peanuts, chopped Lime cheeks To make the pesto, muddle all the ingredients in
  a mortar or blitz in a food processor until smooth. Adjust the seasoning to
  taste, if necessary, then put in a bowl if serving imminently, or decant into
  a clean jar and store in the fridge if making ahead. Toss the halved tomatoes
  and cucumber rounds in the lime juice. Arrange the melon slices on a platter
  and scatter the tomato and cucumber on top. Drizzle with the coriander pesto
  and sprinkle with the sliced chilli, chopped peanuts and reserved coriander
  sprigs. Serve with lime cheeks for squeezing over. These recipes are edited
