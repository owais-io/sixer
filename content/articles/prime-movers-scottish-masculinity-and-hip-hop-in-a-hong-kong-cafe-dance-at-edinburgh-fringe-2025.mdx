  For starters, here are a few of my favourite dancers at the fringe this year.
  One who made me smile is Alex O’Neill in Dublin company CoisCéim Dance
  Theatre’s Dancehall Blues. He’s the highlight of an underpowered piece of
  dance theatre, a duet set in a (somewhat apocalyptic) society in crisis, about
  rediscovering the importance of human connection. O’Neill brings the material
  to life with character and charm, pouncing on the steps, his movement muscular
  and vernacular, with sensitivity and bite. Her show has already ended, but
  Sarah Aviaja Hammeken is absolutely one to watch out for in the future, an
  award-winning Danish dancer/choreographer whose solo Soil is about her
  Greenlandic heritage. The work felt like it could be further developed, but
  every time Hammeken danced I was engrossed in the instinctive expressiveness
  and gravity of her movement, the feeling of someone working things out,
  physically and mentally, a fluent conversation between mind and body. Kennedy
  Junior Muntanga is another utterly compelling mover, a dancer of immense,
  intense power and finesse, but one who seems almost resistant to give us what
  he’s good at. In his experimental solo Akropolis I, there’s even a line where
  he seemingly admonishes himself under his breath: “Just dance!” Akropolis I
  was a late addition to the fringe and shows Muntanga still struggling with
  what he wants to say and how, but he’ll be well worth seeing when he works it
  out. Honourable mention for an acrobat who is also clearly a great dancer with
  a distinctive physical style: Ange Viaud from new company Copenhagen
  Collective, who debuted The Genesis, a large-scale acrobatics show in the mode
  of festival faves Circa or Gravity and Other Myths (the show is three-star
  good with tons of potential). Viaud shows precision gymnastic prowess and
  b-boy flair, but also has a wildness about him, as if anything could happen
  next. From the sample of shows I dipped into this year, it’s hard to spot
  trends across the dance (and circus/physical theatre) programme, except
  perhaps a sense of mild disappointment and the feeling no one’s had quite
  enough rehearsal time to develop their ideas. Often shows are frustrating
  because you can see there’s some great talent or material there but it’s just
  not working. Case in point, Canadian company We All Fall Down, whose last
  fringe show, Papillon, was very well regarded. They returned this year with
  something much more personal. Because You Never Asked is based on a recording
  of co-director Roger White talking to his Jewish grandmother, who escaped from
  Germany in 1939, to Edinburgh. The stories of growing up amid the rise of
  nazism, of Hitler visiting Hamburg, of friends being taken from their homes,
  have huge inbuilt power that is completely drowned out at times by a
  soundtrack that competes in frequency, and the distraction of dance that seems
  wilfully at odds with the text. The music has a thriller-ish tone of
  percussive booms and nerves-on-edge strings that is entirely unnecessary – we
  all know the underlying horror. It’s a bombardment that undermines the
  strength of the source material. Elsewhere, some underwhelming circus-theatre
  from Quebec’s Flip Fabrique in Six°. Contrary to the current vogue for
  stripped-back circus, this one comes with a theatrical setting and quirky
  characters. What that setting is and who those characters are isn’t totally
  clear, and there’s a moral brewing but the big reveal never really comes.
  Nevertheless, it’s genial entertainment with some cheeky acrobats prone to
  silly dancing. Also a little underwhelming, homegrown company Barrowland
  Ballet addressed the topic of the moment, masculinity, in Wee Man,
  particularly as it applies to teenage boys – there were four of them in this
  production and very good they were, too. The show felt a bit like it was in
  its workshop stages and while it was very warm and well-meaning, there was
  nothing too surprising in the ideas offered about what it supposedly takes to
  be a man, even if the quotes no doubt come from real life: don’t cry; if you
  can’t be popular, be funny; be strong, be right, be aggressive. Having said
  that, there were a couple of Scottish references that raised a laugh: “Always
  walk as if you’re wearing a sporran full of porridge”, and the rule of summer,
  apt for the heatwave outside – “When it hits 16 degrees, taps aff!” Still,
  there were surprise finds at the festival, too. Like a sweet kids show from
  Revel Puck Circus, The Ugly Duckling, all about embracing your differences,
  which has a lot of knowing lines for the adults, too. Then the two-hander Go!
  from company Corps In Situ, a martial arts duet that’s beautifully
  choreographic in its sense of rhythm, pace, attack and grace. The performers
  have absolute physical command and focus but there’s playfulness and humour,
  too. It’s a short (40-minute) show that’s skilful and satisfying. Scoring high
  for likability factor is TS Crew from Hong Kong, who in No Sugar No Milk
  combined hip-hop, beatbox, martial arts, circus and a lot of physical humour
  in silly skits, set in a Hong Kong cafe. The high jinks of the slightly
  hapless staff involved low-stakes antics like running scared from a toy mouse
  and artfully chucking packing boxes around. Finally, gently transporting us
  away from the chaos of Edinburgh’s rammed streets is Mele Broomes’s daydreamy
  Through Warm Temperatures, part of the Made in Scotland showcase. (Even local
  artists can barely afford to perform at the festival these days without being
  part of an official showcase, and the dance and circus programmes are
  dominated by international groups.) The piece is like a hypnotic ritual, the
  company of dancers/singers led by Broomes bathed in low light in shades of
  purple, magenta and blue. Cellist/composer Simone Seales sits at the back of
  the stage looping riffs to set up a lulling vibe; dancers’ feet pad side to
  side in a repetitive sway; there’s a shoulder massage, the sheen of castor oil
  on the performers’ skin catching the light. A voice intones: “I search inside
  myself to forgive myself … no shame.” It’s a ritual for healing and
  self-acceptance, and a world I wanted to be absorbed inside. All our Edinburgh
  festival reviews Dancehall Blues is at Assembly @ Dance Base until 24 August.
  Akropolis I is at Assembly @ Dance Base until 24 August. The Genesis is at
  Assembly Hall until 25 August. Because You Never Asked is at Summerhall until
