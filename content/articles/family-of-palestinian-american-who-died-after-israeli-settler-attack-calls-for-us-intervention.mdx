  The family of Khamis al-Ayyad, a Palestinian American who died last week as a
  result of an Israeli settler attack in the occupied West Bank, has called for
  an investigation into his death, amid a rising number of US citizens killed in
  the territory. Ayyad, a 40-year-old father of five and Chicago resident, died
  from smoke inhalation on Thursday after Israeli settlers attacked the town of
  Silwad, outside Ramallah, setting homes and cars on fire. Ayyad fainted while
  trying to put out the fires, his brother said, and died on the way to the
  hospital. He was the latest in a string of Palestinian Americans to have died
  in the West Bank: five US citizens have been killed there since 7 October
  2023, and Ayyad was the second to die in July alone. So far, no one has been
  held accountable for any of the deaths. “The government should protect
  citizens, this is what is written on the American passport. Why do they do
  nothing when it comes to their own citizens who live in the West Bank?” said
  Ayyad’s brother, Anas al-Ayyad, 39. Anas al-Ayyad said that he had contacted
  the US embassy, who promised him they would look into his brother’s death. In
  a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the US state department
  acknowledged the death of a US citizen in Silwad and said they were providing
  consular assistance to the family. Members of the US House and Senate called
  for the Trump administration to pressure Israel to carry out an investigation
  and ensure accountability for the death of Ayyad and the other Americans
  killed by settlers in the West Bank. “We are witnessing the deadly results of
  a pattern of complicity by the Netanyahu government and indifference from the
  US government. It’s clear that we must reinstate sanctions and demand justice
  – including independent, US-led investigations – in the killings of American
  citizens,” the Democratic senator of Maryland Chris Van Hollen told the
  Guardian. The Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations
  (Cair), and Illinois congressman Chuy Garcia, also demanded an investigation
  into Ayyad’s killing. The killings come amid a wave of violence in the West
  Bank, where at least 1,013 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli settlers
  and soldiers since 7 October 2023. Accountability for settlers who commit acts
  of violence against Palestinians is rare, particularly under Israel’s current
  rightwing government. Last week, a famed Palestinian activist, Awdah
  Hathaleen, who helped make the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, was
  shot to death during a settler attack south of Hebron. Sanctions had
  previously been put on the accused killer, Yinon Levy, by President Joe Biden
  but they were later lifted by Donald Trump. Levy was placed under three days
  of house arrest and then later released, though he still might face charges. A
  video showed him working in the same spot where Hathaleen was shot the day
  after his release. Senator Van Hollen said that Trump’s administration repeal
  of US sanctions against Israeli settlers has “sent a message that violent
  settlers can literally get away with murder”. The attack on Silwad was carried
  out around 2.30 in the morning by about 10 Israeli settlers. People rushed
  outside to try to put out the fires in the houses and cars that were set
  alight by settlers, but were met with teargas shot by the Israeli army, Raed
  Hamed, the mayor of Silwad, said. “This is not the first attack by the
  settlers. The settlers want to send a message: There is no safe place for
  Palestinians to live,” said Hamed. The Israeli military acknowledged the
  attack, but said they were unable to identify the suspects. Israeli police
  said it had launched an investigation into the incident. The US ambassador to
  Israel, Mike Huckabee, called for an investigation into the killing of
  20-year-old Sayfollah “Saif” Musallet, who was beaten to death by Israeli
  settlers earlier in July. He also visited the town of Taybeh in mid-July, a
  community with many US citizens that had recently witnessed Israeli attacks
  against its churches. Ayyad’s family say they want action from the government,
  not just words. “If it wasn’t for those settlers attacking us in the middle of
  the night, my brother would not have died. The United States should take solid
  action to defend its citizens against attacks by anyone,” said Anas.
