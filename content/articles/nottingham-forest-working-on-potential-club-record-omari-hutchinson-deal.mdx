  Nottingham Forest are pushing to sign Omari Hutchinson in a potential
  club-record deal worth about £37m. Forest, who are also closing on a £30m move
  for James McAtee from Manchester City, are confident of beating rivals to the
  signing of the Ipswich winger. Hutchinson expressed his desire to return to
  the Premier League to the Ipswich manager, Kieran McKenna, after relegation
  last season and has not featured this campaign. A release clause of about £35m
  is thought to have lapsed. Forest and Brentford have had bids for Hutchinson
  rejected but the former are now optimistic about adding the 21-year-old, who
  has also been the subject of interest from Everton, to their squad. Forest
  made Dan Ndoye their record buy last month by signing the Switzerland winger
  from Bologna for £35m to replace Anthony Elanga, who joined Newcastle in a
  £55m deal, but are ready to eclipse that fee. Forest are also pursuing deals
  for Douglas Luiz, who is keen to return to the Premier League from Juventus,
  the Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo and McAtee, with the England Under-21s
  midfielder poised for a medical in the coming days. Forest are among the clubs
  to have tracked Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes but the Championship club want
  about £40m for the Portuguese midfielder. Chelsea are poised to profit from
  Hutchinson moving on, after they inserted a clause in the £20m deal that took
  him to Ipswich last year entitling them to 25% of any profit from a future
  sale. Hutchinson, who returned to his boyhood club, Chelsea, from Arsenal in
  2022, was one of Ipswich’s best performers last season but scored only three
  top-flight goals.
