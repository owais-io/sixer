  The BBC has launched an investigation into alleged cocaine use by two stars of
  Strictly Come Dancing. The Sun on Sunday reported that the two stars’ alleged
  drug use was “talked about widely among the cast” of the BBC One primetime
  show. The newspaper also claimed that others had reported allegations of drug
  taking on the show to the BBC. The cast members involved in the investigation
  were not named by the newspaper. According to the Sun on Sunday, the
  allegations were made in a legal submission by the law firm Russells in March
  on behalf of a former contestant, the Welsh opera singer Wynne Evans. A BBC
  spokesperson said: “We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing
  with any serious complaint raised with us. We would always encourage people to
  speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to
  comment further.” The newspaper said the BBC had appointed a law firm to lead
  the investigation. It is understood that the corporation often appoints
  external law firms to help lead investigations and report back to an internal
  team. Evans, who was a celebrity dancer in last year’s series, was dropped by
  the BBC for using “inappropriate language” during the launch of the Strictly
  tour. He apologised for language that he called “inappropriate and
  unacceptable” after the Mail on Sunday reported that he was heard making a
  remark to a woman in a video filmed during the Strictly launch event. The
  singer announced in May that he was leaving his BBC Radio Wales show after the
  BBC decided not to renew his contract. This latest investigation comes after
  the BBC launched a review of Strictly in 2024 that looked into allegations of
  bullying and harassment against the former professional dancer Giovanni
  Pernice, made by his former dance partner Amanda Abbington. The corporation
  upheld some, but not all, of the complaints made. In June last year, the BBC
  confirmed Pernice’s departure from the show. Another Strictly professional
  dancer, Graziano Di Prima, also left the show last year after allegations
  about his conduct with a past participant. The BBC announced a series of new
  measures in July 2024 aimed at improving welfare on the show. These include
  the introduction of chaperones who are present at all times during training
  room rehearsals, two new welfare producers, and providing additional training
  for the professional dancers, production team and crew. In June, the
  EastEnders star Jamie Borthwick was suspended by the BBC after a video emerged
  of the actor using an ableist slur during Strictly rehearsals in November.
  Borthwick apologised and a BBC spokesperson said at the time: “This language
  is entirely unacceptable and in no way reflects the values or standards we
  hold and expect at the BBC. We have robust processes in place for this.”
