  teenage girls’

  My earliest reading memory I have a distinct memory of sitting by the
  bookshelves in the first house we lived in and suddenly realising I could
  understand the words in lots of the books. It was like discovering I could
  perform magic – pulling out one book after the other and disappearing into
  other worlds. I bumped into a childhood friend the other day who told me she
  remembers being annoyed when I came for a play date at her house and the first
  thing I wanted to do was see if she had any books I hadn’t read. My favourite
  book growing up I loved Jill Barklem’s Brambly Hedge series as a girl. The
  exquisite intricacy of the pictures, their evocation of a hidden world … I’m
  enjoying rediscovering them with my four‑year‑old. The High Hills has a
  wonderful, Tolkien-esque quest element to it. The book that changed me as a
  teenager Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging by Louise Rennison. I found
  this and the rest of the Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series absolutely
  addictive, hilarious and so good in their understanding of teenage girls,
  their friendships, their humour. I felt like these books really “saw” me and
  my friends and did so compassionately, without talking down to us. The writer
  who changed my mind Patricia Highsmith. Before I read her books, and
  specifically The Talented Mr Ripley and The Two Faces of January, I thought I
  had to like a character in order to want them to succeed. But Highsmith, in
  her brilliantly twisted way, puts us inside the mind of a sociopath in Ripley
  – we’re taken to that really uncomfortable place of rooting for a character we
  know we should hate. We’re desperate for him to get away with it. Or is that
  just me? The book that made me want to be a writer I Capture the Castle by
  Dodie Smith. In a way it’s a book about writing: the protagonist’s father is a
  (failing) writer; the protagonist-narrator keeps reminding us that we’re being
  told a story. I loved it for its intimacy, and for its rich evocation of a
  family and the main character’s coming of age. The book I reread I could pick
  pretty much any Agatha Christie. I enjoyed them when I first read them (far
  too young!) for their puzzle element. Coming back to them as an adult, I
  realised how much darker some of them are: Endless Night, And Then There Were
  None, Crooked House and The Pale Horse are all examples. Now I come back to
  them as a writer to try to work out how she did it. The book I discovered
  later in life Edith Wharton’s Glimpses of the Moon. I read The House of Mirth
  and The Age of Innocence years ago, but hadn’t come across this. When I read
  it recently, I remembered just how much I love her writing. The book I am
  currently reading The Wilderness by Angela Flournoy. It’s the story of five
  Black women and their friendship over 20 years – including careers, marriages
  and motherhood – amid the political, economic and social upheaval of modern
  America. The characters and their friendship are so well realised; it’s
  utterly absorbing. • Lucy Foley’s The Midnight Feast is published in paperback
  by HarperCollins. To support the Guardian order your copy at
