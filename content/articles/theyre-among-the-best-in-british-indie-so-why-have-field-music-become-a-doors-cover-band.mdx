  They’re among the best in British indie. So why have Field Music become a
  Doors cover band?

  For years, Field Music playfully toyed with the idea of forming a hybrid cover
  band called AC/BGs, featuring one set of AC/DC songs done in a Saturday Night
  Fever-style and one set of rock-heavy Bee Gees numbers. “These things are a
  joke until they stop being a joke,” says David Brewis, one half of the
  Sunderland art-pop band. Another idea made it beyond a tour bus gag to become
  their new side hustle: a Doors tribute band called the Fire Doors. When the
  band announced it on Facebook last month, they received critical questions
  asking: why? The band’s response was a piercingly honest multi-page statement.
  Brewis wrote of Field Music’s sincere love of the band, the high levels of
  skill required to do such a job proficiently – and how doing one tribute gig a
  month could help their “dire finances”, having accepted that after nine
  albums, they have “quietly passed into contemporary irrelevance”. He had an
  emphatic signoff: “Why the hell should I be embarrassed?” They were flooded
  with hundreds of comments of support from other professional musicians in
  similar scenarios. “Our situation is not unusual at all,” says Brewis. “There
  are tons of musicians who subsidise work by playing in some kind of
  entertainment band but mostly don’t talk about it because it’s seen as naff or
  embarrassing. It’s like a dirty secret. But me saying it out loud, because I
  have no shame, illustrated something unspoken.” It’s been 20 years since Field
  Music’s self-titled debut album was released, a milestone they will be
  celebrating with a live run in November. In that time, they’ve toured the
  world, released three Top 40 albums, have Spotify streams in the millions,
  found a fan in Prince and mostly made a living from their music. To many,
  Field Music are the definition of a successful band. “To have kept going
  without ever compromising is incredible,” concedes Brewis. “We’ve never had a
  hit, so we’ve never had to conform to anyone’s expectations. We’ve continued
  to make weird music just for us. But the world has changed.” An ageing
  audience, combined with an inability to neatly fit into the modern world of
  genre playlists, along with post-Covid industry changes, has hit them hard.
  “We’ve always worked on the tiniest of margins,” says Brewis. “So to then be
  selling three-quarters of the records we used to sell, while having to do
  twice the amount of promo, and finding it doubly hard to sell the same number
  of tickets for a gig – those are the things which turn our tiny margin of
  sustainability into catastrophic financial doom.” They see this necessary
  shift into cover-band territory – a move they say will sharpen their skills
  and benefit Field Music – as being symbolic of a wider cultural landscape.
  “Everyone in the creative industries has a portfolio career and juggling that
  is now the reality,” Brewis says. “But juggling that so you feel like you’re
  doing something worthwhile and not compromising your principles – that’s the
  game. That’s survival.” His brutal honesty has inadvertently paid off. “I only
  posted on Facebook because I thought, oh, this might sell, like, 10 tickets
  for our gig,” Brewis says. “And then it kind of blew up. Prior to that, I’d
  maybe sent 50 emails to venues and had only managed to book three gigs. We’re
  now booked until next September.” And with good reason. This isn’t a
  half-arsed side project by any means. The band – made up of Andrew Moore;
  Brewis’s brother and bandmate, Peter; and the Futureheads’ David Hyde – are a
  genuine force and pull the Doors’ hits off with clout and conviction. The
  result achieves that magic combination of being so tight they almost sound
  loose. “I’m taking it very, very seriously,” says Brewis, before listing the
  books, documentaries and live footage he’s been studying. “It feels like a
  research project. Every little element of it we are digging into. Which is
  maybe why it doesn’t feel cheesy and naff. It feels like academia. Or like an
  acting role. But it’s also just so much fun.” Brewis is the band’s Jim
  Morrison and, on stage, he looks the part: long hair, necklace, leather
  trousers (faux – he’s vegetarian). He mimics the outre singer with subtlety,
  singing for prolonged periods with his eyes closed, twisting himself around
  the mic stand before bending himself in half. His voice is the most remarkable
  aspect. For those familiar with Brewis’s high-register offerings in Field
  Music (a Talking Heads cover band may have seemed more likely) it’s a shock to
  hear such a deep, raspy voice bellowing from his chest. “It is quite
  throat-shredding,” he admits. For Brewis, aside from having fun with his
  mates, this is simply some clear transparency and communication of what life
  as a professional musician entails for many people now. “The music industry is
  selling a lifestyle,” he says. “A kind of aspiration. A lot of money is made
  based on the perception of success, glamour or cool. I don’t think what we’re
  selling is very appealing, but this is authenticity.” Field Music’s 20th
  anniversary shows run from 7-14 November. The Fire Doors are playing various
  dates into 2026
