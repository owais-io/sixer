  Ederson is considering his Manchester City future, with Pep Guardiola
  reluctant to allow the goalkeeper’s exit unless the Brazilian informs him he
  wishes to leave and a suitable offer is received. If the 31-year-old decides
  he wishes to play elsewhere, City may move for Paris Saint-Germain’s Gianluigi
  Donnarumma. The 26-year-old is available after Luis Enrique, the PSG coach,
  signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille to replace the Italy No 1. At the Club World
  Cup in June Ederson described speculation regarding leaving City as “99% fake
  news” but he is now weighing up a transfer, with Galatasaray a potential
  suitor. City want him to stay and have not received any approaches or bids. On
  Friday Guardiola was asked whether Ederson would travel to Wolves for
  Saturday’s late afternoon Premier League opener. “Apparently, yeah,” the
  manager said. “Ederson didn’t come to me and said he wanted to leave or he has
  an offer. All the players here are our players and I want them. What’s going
  to happen in three weeks [before the window closes], nobody knows.” Last month
  City signed James Trafford from Burnley in a £27m deal, leaving them with
  three goalkeepers who would consider themselves capable first choices, Stefan
  Ortega completing that group. Ederson’s compatriot Savinho is being monitored
  by Tottenham. He is not in Saturday’s squad due to injury but it is not
  thought this would prevent any potential transfer. Guardiola said: “Whether
  it’s Tottenham in that case or any other club, a player should call the club
  [if they wish to move]. I am only concerned right now that Savinho will be
  with us for the rest of the season and hopefully many years because, at 21
  with the potential he has, he has to improve in final positions but he is an
  extraordinary player. “At the end, as always, the desire of the players is
  above everything but then they have to find an agreement with the club. If
  they don’t reach an agreement, the player will be here because the club spends
  money on those players.” Guardiola was asked whether he had spoken to Savinho
  and Ederson regarding their futures. “No. If they want to leave, they will
  come to me,” he said. “If they want to leave, they will knock on my door.”
  Guardiola was asked whether Ederson was his No 1 for the season. “Right now,
  Eddy,” he said. “He’s fit, yeah.” Rodri had a setback in City’s 4-3 Club World
  Cup defeat by Al-Hilal in his fifth appearance after a anterior cruciate
  injury but Guardiola said the midfielder would travel to Wolves. “His knee is
  perfect but he came back against Juventus [at Club World Cup] and after
  [against Al-Hilal] had an injury of six weeks with his leg,” he said. “We have
  to try to avoid that [again]. He needs minutes in training sessions, a few
  minutes if possible with the games. We want a comeback, not steps back. Then
  you have the dynamic where you cannot get rhythm. He made good sessions
  already and tomorrow he is travelling, and we will decide if he can play some
  minutes.”
