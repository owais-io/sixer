  Time to wrap up…. Sales of new Tesla cars slumped by 59% year-on-year in the
  UK last month, but Chinese carmakers led by BYD reported big jumps in UK
  sales. BYD sales quadrupled year on year to reach 3,200 in July, even as
  overall sales of all types of car declined by 5% to 140,000, according to data
  published on Tuesday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT),
  a lobby group. Former star stock picker Neil Woodford and his investment
  management company have been fined almost £46m by the UK’s financial regulator
  over the collapse of his popular equity fund. The Financial Conduct Authority
  (FCA) has given Woodford a penalty of £5.89m and banned him from holding
  senior manager roles and managing funds for retail investors and fined
  Woodford Investment Management (WIM) £40m. Donald Trump has attacked Jaguar
  Land Rover’s divisive rebranding strategy, hours after Britain’s largest
  carmaker announced its new boss. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform
  that the auto company, owned by India’s Tata Motors, was “in absolute turmoil”
  and claimed that the “CEO resigned in disgrace”. The UK’s dominant service
  sector has reported its biggest drop in new orders in almost three years in
  July, adding to pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates on
  Thursday. The oil and gas group BP is launching a fresh cost-cutting scheme,
  despite reporting better-than-expected profits, as it tries to do more for its
  shareholders to fend off pressure from activist investors. The fossil fuel
  company said it would begin a fresh review of its business when its new chair,
  Albert Manifold, joins the board in September. Awkwardly, a rival survey of
  America’s services sector paints a darker picture. According to the Institute
  of Supply Management, US service sector firms barely grew in July as Donald
  Trump’s trade wars pushed up costs, and led to job losses. The ISM’s service
  sector PMI has dropped to 50.1% last month from 50.8% in June, a level that
  shows growth almost petered out. One company, in the Agriculture, Forestry,
  Fishing &amp; Hunting sector, told ISM: “Higher tariffs are increasing the
  cost of imported feed ingredients and trace minerals for livestock and poultry
  feeds. Business and customer concerns over additional cost risk due to
  additional tariffs.” Encouraging economic news from the US: America’s service
  sector grew at a faster rate last month. The latest poll of purchasing
  managers from S&amp;P Global has found that business activity in the services
  sector increased at the sharpest pace in the year-to-date amid a solid and
  accelerated expansion in new business. S&amp;P Global adds: Companies
  responded to higher workloads by hiring additional staff, albeit only
  modestly. Meanwhile, tariffs continued to add to inflationary pressures,
  resulting in faster increases in both input costs and output prices. Its
  services PMI Business Activity Index rose to a seven-month high of 55.7 in
  July, up from 52.9 in June, showing faster growth. Google has outlined its
  latest step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) with a new model
  that allows AI systems to interact with a convincing simulation of the real
  world. The Genie 3 “world model” could be used to train robots and autonomous
  vehicles as they engage with realistic recreations of environments such as
  warehouses, according to Google. The US technology and search company’s AI
  division, Google DeepMind, argues that world models are a key step to
  achieving AGI, a hypothetical level of AI where a system can carry out most
  tasks on a par with humans – not just individual tasks such as playing chess
  or translating languages – and potentially do someone’s job. DeepMind said
  such models would play an important role in the development of AI agents, or
  systems that carry out tasks autonomously. “We expect this technology to play
  a critical role as we push toward AGI, and agents play a greater role in the
  world,” DeepMind said. There’s been disruption at London’s Heathrow Airport
  today, after a key road tunnel was closed. Passengers hoping to get away on
  their summer break faced delays after the Central Terminal Area tunnel to
  Terminals 2 and 3 is was closed. Heathrow blamed a technical issue, and urged
  passengers to use public transport to Terminal 5, where train services were
  available to all other terminals. The closure lead to heavy queues on the
  roads leading to Heathrow….. …and chaotic scenes inside the airport. Heathrow
  says that the road tunnel to Terminals 2 and 3 has now reopened, but warned
  that there is still congestion at the airport, and so they recommend allowing
  extra time for your journey. The US trade deficit with the rest of the world
  has narrowed, as the rush to import goods into America ahead of Donald Trump’s
  tariffs ended. The US’s goods and services deficit dipped to $60.2bn in June,
  down $11.5bn from $71.7bn in May. This decline was due to a narrowing in the
  US goods deficit, while its services surplus grew a little. Imports into the
  US fell by $12.8bn to $337.5bn in June, while exports dipped by $1.3bn to
  $277.3bn. Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, explains:
  The narrowing of the trade deficit was mainly due to a normalisation in
  pharmaceutical imports and while exports appeared weak, this was primarily due
  to a fall in gold exports. The big picture is that, despite June’s fall,
  imports aren’t collapsing and are roughly in line with their levels last year.
  That said, with export orders weak, it seems likely that exports will struggle
  over the coming months. Showing his inate ability to commit news, Donald Trump
  revealed during today’s CNBC interview that he will unveil new tariffs on
  semiconductors and chips as soon as next week. He told the “Squawk Box” show
  that an announcement will come “within the next week or so,” saying: “We’re
  going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate
  category, because we want them made in the United States.” U.S. President
  Donald Trump has also said recent falls in energy prices could pressure
  Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine. In his inerview
  with CNBC, Trump said: “If energy goes down enough, Putin is going to stop
  killing people. If you get energy down, another $10 a barrel, he’s going to
  have no choice because his economy stinks.” Brent crude is curently trading at
  $67.82 per barrel, down 1.35% today, down from over $76 per barrel a year ago.
  Donald Trump has revealed he is considering four candidates — including former
  Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director
  Kevin Hassett — to become the next head of America’s central bank. In an
  interview with CNBC, Trump said: “I think I say Kevin and Kevin, both Kevins
  are very good, and there are other people that are very good too.” Current
  Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s term expires next May. Trump also
  revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told him he did not want to be
  nominated to replace Powell at the Fed, as he wants to stay in his current
  role. Neil Woodford is also facing calls for his CBE to be revoked. The
  Woodford Campaign Group and Transparency Task Force have repeated their
  request for Mr Woodford’s CBE to be forfeited now that the Financial Conduct
  Authority’s investigation has been completed. More than 500 people have so far
  signed a petition drawn up by the Woodford Campaign Group calling for the
  forfeiture. In an open letter to Sir Chris Wormald, chairman of the Honours
  Forfeiture Committee at the Cabinet Office, Andy Agathangelou, who founded
  both campaign groups, said: “This scandal is obviously a matter of great
  public interest – hundreds of thousands of people have been directly impacted
  by it, many having lost life-changing amounts of money. Trade war news: Swiss
  president Karin Keller-Sutter and business minister Guy Parmelin will fly to
  Washington on Tuesday, the government said, to try to avoid the 39% tariffs
  announced by President Donald Trump on exports to the United States. The pair
  will “facilitate meetings with the US authorities at short notice and hold
  talks with a view to improving the tariff situation for Switzerland,” the
  government said. The trip comes after Keller-Sutter was accused of mishandling
  a vital phone call with the White House, leading Trump to hit Switzerland with
  a shock 39% export tariff. Over on Wall Street, construction and mining
  equipment company Caterpillar has missed second-quarter profit expectations.
  Caterpillar’s adjusted profit per share in the second quarter of 2025 fell to
  $4.72, down from $5.99 in Q2 2024. The drop in earnings was due to a fall in
  profit margins. Sales and revenues for the second quarter of 2025 dipped by 1%
  to $16.6bn, Britain’s main minimum wage rate will probably need to rise by
  around 4.1% next year to £12.71 an hour to keep up with the government’s goal
  for it to match two thirds of median earnings, according to the body which
  sets the rate. The Low Pay Commission said today the final figure for the
  National Living Wage could range between £12.55 and £12.86 an hour. The
  commission is due to provide a firm recommendation to the government by the
  end of October. The national living wage is currently set at £12.21 for those
  aged 21 and over. Britain’s service sector companies were hit by a drop in
  orders last month, as demand at home and abroad remained sluggish. Service
  sector growth slowed last month amid a decline in new work, according to the
  latest survey of purchasing managers from data firm S&amp;P Global. It’s UK
  Services PMI Business Activity Index has dropped to 51.8, from 52.8 in June,
  showing a slowdown in growth. The survey found that total new work decreased
  in July, at the fastest rate since November 2022. Export sales also fell in
  July, blamed on fragile global economic conditions and elevated geopolitical
  tensions. Worryingly, services firms cut staff again. Tim Moore, economics
  director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: “UK service providers
  recorded a third consecutive monthly rise in business activity, but they were
  unable to maintain the growth rate achieved in June. Moreover, new business
  intakes swung back into contraction during July, with the downturn in order
  books the fastest for just over two-and-a-half years. Risk aversion and low
  confidence among clients were the main reasons provided for sluggish sales
  pipelines, alongside an unfavourable global economic backdrop. Hiring trends
  were especially subdued, with total workforce numbers decreasing to the
  greatest extent since February. Worries about rising payroll costs were cited
  as the main factor holding back recruitment. Newsflash: The UK’s financial
  regulator has decided to fine former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his
  investment management company nearly £46m, over the collapse of his popular
  equity fund. The Financial Conduct Authority says it has decided to fine
  Woodford £5,888,800 and ban him from holding senior manager roles and managing
  funds for retail investors. The FCA has also decided to fine Woodford
  Investment Management (WIM) £40,000,000. The penalties result from failures in
  their management of the Woodford Equity Income Fund (WEIF), the FCA says,
  which collapsed in October 2019 after investors rushed to withdraw money in
  response to a raft of poorly performing company investments, including some
  hard-to-sell, illiquid assets. The fund was frozen and later closed and wound
  up. About 300,000 people had invested in the fund, including 130,000 through
  Hargreaves Lansdown, which is being sued by thousands of investors. In today’s
  ruling, the FCA explains that between July 2018 and June 2019 WIM and Woodford
  made “unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions”, including selling
  sold more liquid investments (where it’s easier to find a buyer) and buying
  less liquid ones (which are harder to shift quickly at a good price). They
  also failed to react appropriately as the fund’s value declined, its liquidity
  worsened and more investors withdrew their money, the regulator says. However,
  these findings are only “provisional”, as Neil Woodford and Woodford
  Investment Management have referred the Decision Notices to the UK’s Upper
  Tribunal. The FCA is also critical of Woodford – a former star investment
  manager – today, saying he held “a defective and unreasonably narrow
  understanding of his responsibilities.” Steve Smart, joint executive director
  of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ‘Being a leader in
  financial services comes with responsibilities as well as profile. Mr Woodford
  simply doesn’t accept he had any role in managing the liquidity of the fund.
  The very minimum investors should expect is those managing their money make
  sensible decisions and take their senior role seriously. Neither Neil Woodford
  nor Woodford Investment Management did so, putting at risk the money people
  had entrusted them with.’ It appears that the UK government’s offer to
  subsidise new electric car purchases may have actually dampened the car market
  last month. The grants, which offer up to 10% off the price of many electric
  cars costing less than £37,000, were announced in mid-July. But the government
  only revealed the first eligible cars today – four Citroën models. The
  discount scheme won’t apply to Teslas (as they’re too expensive), or models
  from China as they don’t pass the government’s rules on environmentally
  sustainable manufacturing practices. The SMMT explain: The newly announced
  Electric Car Grant (ECG) provides a welcome and much-needed fiscal incentive
  for BEV uptake, but full model eligibility has yet to be confirmed, causing
  some buyers to hold off pending confirmation of which vehicles will qualify
  for a discount of up to £3,750. Its sales figures show that registrations of
  plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) rose 33.0% in July while battery
  electric vehicles (BEVs) rose 9.1%, but there was a 10% drop in hybrids
  (HEVs). Petrol sales fell 14.7% and diesel were down 7.9%. BYD wasn’t the only
  Chinese EV maker growing its UK market share last month. Jaecoo, a brand from
  Chinese vehicle manufacturer Chery, sold 1,915 cars in the UK in July – a year
  ago, it didn’t sell any, as it only launched in the UK early in 2025. Omoda,
  another Chery brand, also made its debut this year – with 1,874 of its cars
  registered in the UK in July. Just in: Sales of Teslas in the UK more than
  halved, year-on-year, in the UK last month as the electric carmaker’s
  struggles continue. Industry body data just released shows that just 987 new
  Teslas were registered in the UK in July, almost 60% less than the 2,462
  registered in July 2024. This means Tesla’s UK market share shrank to 0.7% in
  July, from 1.67% a year ago. For 2025 to date, Tesla sales in the UK are 7%
  lower, during a year in which CEO Elon Musk has faced heavy criticism for his
  – now-soured – relationship with Donald Trump. The wider UK electric car
  sector grew in July, though. Sales of battery-powered vehicles (BEVs) rose by
  9.1% to 29,825, giving BEVs a 21.3% share of the market. China’s BYD more than
  quadrupled its sales last month, to 3,184 in July from 768 a year ago. The
  company recently launched a relatively cheap electric car, the Dolphin Surf,
  in the UK. BYD’s sales are up 514% during 2025 to 22,574, up from 3,672 in
  January-July 2024. That’s only slightly fewer than Tesla which has shifted
  23,708 cars so far this year. Last month Tesla reported a large drop in
  quarterly deliveries, as demand faltered due to the backlash over CEO Elon
  Musk’s political stance. Tesla’s sales have also been hurt by its aging model
  line-up – the company has been rolling out an updated Model Y this year,
  dubbed the “Juniper” refresh. Yesterday, Tesla announced it was handing Musk
  stock options worth almost $30bn, in an attempt to keep him committed to the
  company for the next few years. Overall, the UK’s new car market shrank by 5%
  in July with 140,154 units registered, which is the weakest July since 2022.
  Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: July’s dip shows yet again the new car
  market’s sensitivity to external factors, and the pressing need for consumer
  certainty. Confirming which models qualify for the new EV grant, alongside
  compelling manufacturer discounts on a huge choice of exciting new vehicles,
  should send a strong signal to buyers that now is the time to switch. That
  would mean increased demand for the rest of this year and into next, which is
  good news for the industry, car buyers and our environmental ambitions. The
  UK’s Domino’s Pizza Group has cut its profit forecast this morning, warning
  that costs are climbing as sales fall. The group, which has the exclusive
  rights to the Domino’s brand in the UK and Ireland, reported that total orders
  were flat in the first half of this year, and that like-for-like sales fell
  0.7% in April-June. Pre-tax profits have fallen by almost a third, on a
  statutory basis, from £59.4m to £40.5m. Domino’s now expect underlying profits
  to come in between £130m to £140m, down from a previous forecast of
  £140.8m-£149.7m. Several factors were blamed, including weak consumer
  confidence and rising employment costs. CEO Andrew Rennie blamed higher
  employment costs – following last year’s budget – and uncertainty over what
  chancellor Rachel Reeves might announce this autumn, saying: “There’s no
  getting away from the fact that the market has become tougher both for us and
  our franchisees, and that’s meant that the positive performance across the
  first four months didn’t continue into May and June. Given weaker consumer
  confidence, increased employment costs and uncertainty ahead of the Autumn
  Statement, franchisees are taking a more cautious approach to store openings
  for the time being. Shares in Domino’s Pizza Group have fallen by 19% in early
  trading. Overnight, UK luxury-car maker Jaguar Land Rover has named a new CEO
  – winning a blast from Donald Trump. JLR named P B Balaji, the finance boss of
  parent company Tata Motors, as its new chief executive, increasing the Indian
  owner’s influence over the company. Balaji will replace Adrian Mardell, who
  had run JLR for the last few years. Mardell’s tenure will be remembered for
  last year’s rebranding, and the launch of a new concept electric car which
  looked nothing like a traditional Jag, which captured attention and wound-up
  the rightwing commentariat. Anti-woke cheerleader Donald Trump was quick to
  give Mardell a hoofing on his way out the door. Posting on his Truth Social
  site, Trump declared that Jaguar’s “stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement”
  had been “A TOTAL DISASTER!”, adding: The CEO just resigned in disgrace, and
  the company is in absolute turmoil. Who wants to buy a Jaguar after looking at
  that disgraceful ad. Shouldn’t they have learned a lesson from Bud Lite, which
  went Woke and essentially destroyed, in a short campaign, the Company. Trump
  also hailed actor Sydney Sweeney’s new advert for American Eagle as a triumph,
  saying the “HOTTEST” ad meant jeans were now “flying off the shelves.” Sweeney
  is probably in Trump’s good books after it emerged she was a registered
  Republican voter in Florida. BP is also planning to pump more cash to its
  shareholders. The company is raising its quarterly dividend by 4 per cent to
  8.32 cents a share, subject to board approval. It has also announced a new
  $750m share buyback programme. Oil giant BP is launching a new cost-cutting
  scheme, despite reporting better than expected profits, as its incoming
  chairman gets to grips with the company in the face of pressure from activist
  investors. BP has beaten City expectations this morning by reporting a smaller
  drop in underlying profits than expected in the last quarter. On an underlying
  replacement cost basis, profits rose to $2.35bn in April-June. That’s 15%
  lower than the same quarter a year ago when the company benefitted from higher
  oil and gas prices, but also a jump on the $1.38bn profits posted in
  January-March. Analysts had forecast a smaller rise in underlying profits, to
  $1.8bn. But despite this beat, CEO Murray Auchincloss says “there’s much more
  to do”. Auchincloss tells shareholders this morning: In advance of chair
  elect, Albert Manifold joining the board on 1 September, he and I have been in
  discussions and have agreed that we will conduct a thorough review of our
  portfolio of businesses to ensure we are maximizing shareholder value moving
  forward - allocating capital effectively. We are also initiating a further
  cost review and, whilst we will not compromise on safety, we are doing this
  with a view to being best in class in our industry. Earlier this year, BP
  announced plans to cut more than $5bn from its previous green investment plan.
  But activist investor Elliott Management has been pushing BP to cut its
  operating expenses more aggressively and demanding more cost reductions.
  Manifold is due to become chairman on 1 October, a month after joining the
  board as a non-executive director. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling
  coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. UK car
  sales dipped last month, after a bumper June. British new car registrations
  fell about 5% year-on-year in July, according to preliminary data released
  this morning by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Battery
  electric vehicles are now projected to account for 23.8% of new registrations
  in 2025, slightly up from SMMT’s previous forecast of 23.5%. The SMMT should
  release its final figures for July at 9am. The data comes as the UK government
  announces that France’s Citroën will be the first company to benefit from its
  new discount scheme, which cuts the cost of a new EV for consumers. Transport
  Secretary Heidi Alexander has confirmed buyers will get discounts of £1,500
  off 4 Citroën models – the Citroën ë-C3, ë–C4, ë-C5 and the ë-Berlingo - from
  today. The scheme aims to bring down the price of electric cars to more
  closely match their petrol and diesel counterparts. The agenda 9am BST: UK new

Caterpillar’s adjusted profit per share in the second quarter of 2025 fell to $4.72, down from $5.99 in Q2 2024. The drop in earnings was due to a fall in profit margins. Sales and revenues for the second quarter of 2025 dipped by 1% to $16.6bn, Britain’s main minimum wage rate will probably need to rise by around 4.1% next year to £12.71 an hour to keep up with the government’s goal for it to match two thirds of median earnings, according to the body which sets the rate. The Low Pay Commission said today the final figure for the National Living Wage could range between £12.55 and £12.86 an hour. The commission is due to provide a firm recommendation to the government by the end of October. The national living wage is currently set at £12.21 for those aged 21 and over. Britain’s service sector companies were hit by a drop in orders last month, as demand at home and abroad remained sluggish. Service sector growth slowed last month amid a decline in new work, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers from data firm S&amp;P Global. It’s UK Services PMI Business Activity Index has dropped to 51.8, from 52.8 in June, showing a slowdown in growth. The survey found that total new work decreased in July, at the fastest rate since November 2022. Export sales also fell in July, blamed on fragile global economic conditions and elevated geopolitical tensions. Worryingly, services firms cut staff again. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says: “UK service providers recorded a third consecutive monthly rise in business activity, but they were unable to maintain the growth rate achieved in June. Moreover, new business intakes swung back into contraction during July, with the downturn in order books the fastest for just over two-and-a-half years. Risk aversion and low confidence among clients were the main reasons provided for sluggish sales pipelines, alongside an unfavourable global economic backdrop. Hiring trends were especially subdued, with total workforce numbers decreasing to the greatest extent since February. Worries about rising payroll costs were cited as the main factor holding back recruitment. Newsflash: The UK’s financial regulator has decided to fine former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his investment management company nearly £46m, over the collapse of his popular equity fund. The Financial Conduct Authority says it has decided to fine Woodford £5,888,800 and ban him from holding senior manager roles and managing funds for retail investors. The FCA has also decided to fine Woodford Investment Management (WIM) £40,000,000. The penalties result from failures in their management of the Woodford Equity Income Fund (WEIF), the FCA says, which collapsed in October 2019 after investors rushed to withdraw money in response to a raft of poorly performing company investments, including some hard-to-sell, illiquid assets. The fund was frozen and later closed and wound up. About 300,000 people had invested in the fund, including 130,000 through Hargreaves Lansdown, which is being sued by thousands of investors. In today’s ruling, the FCA explains that between July 2018 and June 2019 WIM and Woodford made “unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions”, including selling sold more liquid investments (where it’s easier to find a buyer) and buying less liquid ones (which are harder to shift quickly at a good price). They also failed to react appropriately as the fund’s value declined, its liquidity worsened and more investors withdrew their money, the regulator says. However, these findings are only “provisional”, as Neil Woodford and Woodford Investment Management have referred the Decision Notices to the UK’s Upper Tribunal. The FCA is also critical of Woodford – a former star investment manager – today, saying he held “a defective and unreasonably narrow understanding of his responsibilities.” Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ‘Being a leader in financial services comes with responsibilities as well as profile. Mr Woodford simply doesn’t accept he had any role in managing the liquidity of the fund. The very minimum investors should expect is those managing their money make sensible decisions and take their senior role seriously. Neither Neil Woodford nor Woodford Investment Management did so, putting at risk the money people had entrusted them with.’ It appears that the UK government’s offer to subsidise new electric car purchases may have actually dampened the car market last month. The grants, which offer up to 10% off the price of many electric cars costing less than £37,000, were announced in mid-July. But the government only revealed the first eligible cars today – four Citroën models. The discount scheme won’t apply to Teslas (as they’re too expensive), or models from China as they don’t pass the government’s rules on environmentally sustainable manufacturing practices. The SMMT explain: The newly announced Electric Car Grant (ECG) provides a welcome and much-needed fiscal incentive for BEV uptake, but full model eligibility has yet to be confirmed, causing some buyers to hold off pending confirmation of which vehicles will qualify for a discount of up to £3,750. Its sales figures show that registrations of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) rose 33.0% in July while battery electric vehicles (BEVs) rose 9.1%, but there was a 10% drop in hybrids (HEVs). Petrol sales fell 14.7% and diesel were down 7.9%. BYD wasn’t the only Chinese EV maker growing its UK market share last month. Jaecoo, a brand from Chinese vehicle manufacturer Chery, sold 1,915 cars in the UK in July – a year ago, it didn’t sell any, as it only launched in the UK early in 2025. Omoda, another Chery brand, also made its debut this year – with 1,874 of its cars registered in the UK in July. Just in: Sales of Teslas in the UK more than halved, year-on-year, in the UK last month as the electric carmaker’s struggles continue. Industry body data just released shows that just 987 new Teslas were registered in the UK in July, almost 60% less than the 2,462 registered in July 2024. This means Tesla’s UK market share shrank to 0.7% in July, from 1.67% a year ago. For 2025 to date, Tesla sales in the UK are 7% lower, during a year in which CEO Elon Musk has faced heavy criticism for his – now-soured – relationship with Donald Trump. The wider UK electric car sector grew in July, though. Sales of battery-powered vehicles (BEVs) rose by 9.1% to 29,825, giving BEVs a 21.3% share of the market. China’s BYD more than quadrupled its sales last month, to 3,184 in July from 768 a year ago. The company recently launched a relatively cheap electric car, the Dolphin Surf, in the UK. BYD’s sales are up 514% during 2025 to 22,574, up from 3,672 in January-July 2024. That’s only slightly fewer than Tesla which has shifted 23,708 cars so far this year. Last month Tesla reported a large drop in quarterly deliveries, as demand faltered due to the backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s political stance. Tesla’s sales have also been hurt by its aging model line-up – the company has been rolling out an updated Model Y this year, dubbed the “Juniper” refresh. Yesterday, Tesla announced it was handing Musk stock options worth almost $30bn, in an attempt to keep him committed to the company for the next few years. Overall, the UK’s new car market shrank by 5% in July with 140,154 units registered, which is the weakest July since 2022. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: July’s dip shows yet again the new car market’s sensitivity to external factors, and the pressing need for consumer certainty. Confirming which models qualify for the new EV grant, alongside compelling manufacturer discounts on a huge choice of exciting new vehicles, should send a strong signal to buyers that now is the time to switch. That would mean increased demand for the rest of this year and into next, which is good news for the industry, car buyers and our environmental ambitions. The UK’s Domino’s Pizza Group has cut its profit forecast this morning, warning that costs are climbing as sales fall. The group, which has the exclusive rights to the Domino’s brand in the UK and Ireland, reported that total orders were flat in the first half of this year, and that like-for-like sales fell 0.7% in April-June. Pre-tax profits have fallen by almost a third, on a statutory basis, from £59.4m to £40.5m. Domino’s now expect underlying profits to come in between £130m to £140m, down from a previous forecast of £140.8m-£149.7m. Several factors were blamed, including weak consumer confidence and rising employment costs. CEO Andrew Rennie blamed higher employment costs – following last year’s budget – and uncertainty over what chancellor Rachel Reeves might announce this autumn, saying: “There’s no getting away from the fact that the market has become tougher both for us and our franchisees, and that’s meant that the positive performance across the first four months didn’t continue into May and June. Given weaker consumer confidence, increased employment costs and uncertainty ahead of the Autumn Statement, franchisees are taking a more cautious approach to store openings for the time being. Shares in Domino’s Pizza Group have fallen by 19% in early trading. Overnight, UK luxury-car maker Jaguar Land Rover has named a new CEO – winning a blast from Donald Trump. JLR named P B Balaji, the finance boss of parent company Tata Motors, as its new chief executive, increasing the Indian owner’s influence over the company. Balaji will replace Adrian Mardell, who had run JLR for the last few years. Mardell’s tenure will be remembered for last year’s rebranding, and the launch of a new concept electric car which looked nothing like a traditional Jag, which captured attention and wound-up the rightwing commentariat. Anti-woke cheerleader Donald Trump was quick to give Mardell a hoofing on his way out the door. Posting on his Truth Social site, Trump declared that Jaguar’s “stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement” had been “A TOTAL DISASTER!”, adding: The CEO just resigned in disgrace, and the company is in absolute turmoil. Who wants to buy a Jaguar after looking at that disgraceful ad. Shouldn’t they have learned a lesson from Bud Lite, which went Woke and essentially destroyed, in a short campaign, the Company. Trump also hailed actor Sydney Sweeney’s new advert for American Eagle as a triumph, saying the “HOTTEST” ad meant jeans were now “flying off the shelves.” Sweeney is probably in Trump’s good books after it emerged she was a registered Republican voter in Florida. BP is also planning to pump more cash to its shareholders. The company is raising its quarterly dividend by 4 per cent to 8.32 cents a share, subject to board approval. It has also announced a new $750m share buyback programme. Oil giant BP is launching a new cost-cutting scheme, despite reporting better than expected profits, as its incoming chairman gets to grips with the company in the face of pressure from activist investors. BP has beaten City expectations this morning by reporting a smaller drop in underlying profits than expected in the last quarter. On an underlying replacement cost basis, profits rose to $2.35bn in April-June. That’s 15% lower than the same quarter a year ago when the company benefitted from higher oil and gas prices, but also a jump on the $1.38bn profits posted in January-March. Analysts had forecast a smaller rise in underlying profits, to $1.8bn. But despite this beat, CEO Murray Auchincloss says “there’s much more to do”. Auchincloss tells shareholders this morning: In advance of chair elect, Albert Manifold joining the board on 1 September, he and I have been in discussions and have agreed that we will conduct a thorough review of our portfolio of businesses to ensure we are maximizing shareholder value moving forward - allocating capital effectively. We are also initiating a further cost review and, whilst we will not compromise on safety, we are doing this with a view to being best in class in our industry. Earlier this year, BP announced plans to cut more than $5bn from its previous green investment plan. But activist investor Elliott Management has been pushing BP to cut its operating expenses more aggressively and demanding more cost reductions. Manifold is due to become chairman on 1 October, a month after joining the board as a non-executive director. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. UK car sales dipped last month, after a bumper June. British new car registrations fell about 5% year-on-year in July, according to preliminary data released this morning by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Battery electric vehicles are now projected to account for 23.8% of new registrations in 2025, slightly up from SMMT’s previous forecast of 23.5%. The SMMT should release its final figures for July at 9am. The data comes as the UK government announces that France’s Citroën will be the first company to benefit from its new discount scheme, which cuts the cost of a new EV for consumers. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has confirmed buyers will get discounts of £1,500 off 4 Citroën models – the Citroën ë-C3, ë–C4, ë-C5 and the ë-Berlingo - from today. The scheme aims to bring down the price of electric cars to more closely match their petrol and diesel counterparts.
