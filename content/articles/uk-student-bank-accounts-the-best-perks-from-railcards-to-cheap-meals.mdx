  This month, hundreds of thousands of students across the UK will receive some
  life-changing news that will determine where they spend the next few years of
  their lives. However, amid all the celebrations, as sixth-formers find out if
  they got into their first-choice university, and the (hopefully temporary)
  sorrows, as those whose exams did not go to plan scramble for a place through
  clearing, there are some important financial matters to think about. One of
  these is sorting out a student bank account. If you are heading to university,
  this account will be your constant companion over the next few years, so it is
  vital to pick one that works well for you. Many people select a student bank
  account after the A-level or Scottish highers results day, when they know
  where they are going. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, results day is
  14 August, while in Scotland it is this coming Tuesday (5 August). At this
  time of year, high street banks and building societies dangle various tempting
  goodies in front of young people, knowing full well that some will stay on as
  customers for years – or even decades – after they have finished their studies
  and entered the world of work. However, for many, the most-important feature
  will be the size of the interest-free overdraft on offer. You are not required
  to have a student bank account – you could opt for a standard current account.
  However, those aimed at university-goers typically offer features you cannot
  get elsewhere. “Students may be enticed by the free perks, but it is essential
  they compare the whole bundle alongside the 0% overdraft in the first
  instance,” says Rachel Springall, a finance expert at the website
  Moneyfactscompare.co.uk. Interestingly, this year Martin Lewis’s
  MoneySavingExpert.com and the Save the Student website have chosen the same
  providers when it comes to their top four student accounts: Santander, NatWest
  and its Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) brand, and Nationwide. Once again,
  NatWest and RBS have been highlighted as the banks offering the most generous
  interest-free overdraft deals – up to £3,250 in the third year of study.
  That’s assuming you are eligible for that amount. Santander is not as generous
  but it scores highly. That is partly because, with most banks, the quoted
  overdraft amounts are “up to” and may only be available in your final year at
  university or only to those with a decent credit rating, whereas with
  Santander you are guaranteed the full £1,500 in years one to three, provided
  you meet the basic criteria, explains the Save the Student money advice
  website. Santander’s free four-year young person’s railcard is also a big
  draw. Here we look at the perks and interest-free overdrafts on offer from the
  main players. NatWest and RBS The freebies: £85 cashback (although down from
  £100 last year) and a free tastecard, valid for four years and offering
  two-for-one meals out and other dining discounts. NatWest and RBS say the
  tastecard is worth £79.99 a year, although at the time of writing, annual
  membership was available for £29.99. Interest-free overdraft: up to £2,000
  from year one (limited to £500 in your first term). Up to £3,250 from year
  three onwards. Anything else? NatWest and RBS again came top in Save the
  Student’s banking survey earlier this year, with student satisfaction scores
  of 4.34 and 4.32, respectively, out of five. Santander The freebies: the Edge
  student account comes with a free four-year 16-25 railcard that the bank says
  is worth £115, offering students up to a third off most rail fares. There’s a
  prize draw for those who open, or transfer to, the account before 17 October
  this year, with prizes ranging from £20 to £100,000. Also, you can pay into a
  regular savings account paying 5%, and get access to cashback and offers via
  the bank’s Santander Boosts rewards programme. Interest-free overdraft: £1,500
  for the first three years, provided you meet the basic criteria (registering
  for online banking and paying in a certain amount). This can increase to
  £1,800 in year four and £2,000 in year five if students continue with their
  studies. Anything else? Santander was once again the most commonly used bank
  among those surveyed by Save the Student, although its market share has
  dropped slightly to 18% from 21% last year. “Even when I was at university,
  Santander were very popular,” says Tom Allingham, the communications director
  at Save the Student. “They definitely make a conscious effort in that space.”
  However, in terms of overdrafts, NatWest and RBS “are offering more than
  £1,000 more at the maximum level”, he adds. Nationwide The freebies: the
  building society offers £100 cashback and £120 worth of Just Eat vouchers,
  paid out as £10 a month over the first year. Interest-free overdraft: provided
  you meet the basic criteria, you are guaranteed a £1,000 0% overdraft in year
  one. It is then up to £2,000 in year two, and up to £3,000 in year three (and
  beyond, if applicable). Anything else? If you have, or open, a savings account
  with Nationwide as well, you could get an annual Fairer Share scheme payment.
  For the last three years running it has paid out £100 to eligible members.
  Some students will like the fact that Nationwide is a mutual (owned by its
  members rather than shareholders), gives 1% of its profits to charities, and
  has made a pledge to keep branches. Lloyds Bank The freebies: £100 cashback
  (down from £110 last year), plus £90 in Deliveroo vouchers (£15 a month for
  six months) provided they make a minimum number of transactions. Interest-free
  overdraft: up to £1,500 in years one to three, and then up to £2,000 in years
  four to six (if applicable). Anything else? With Lloyds’s Everyday Offers
  scheme, students can earn up to 15% cashback at selected retailers. If they
  sign up to Deliveroo Students at the start of term, they will pay no delivery
  charges with Deliveroo Plus Silver on takeaway orders above £15 (restaurants)
  or £25 (grocery and retail shops). HSBC The freebies: no major freebies for
  new student account customers at the time of writing. Interest-free overdraft:
  up to £1,000 when you open the account. You can ask for an increase to up to
  £2,000 in year two and up to £3,000 in year three. Anything else? Students can
  access the bank’s home&amp;Away scheme, which offers discounts on matters such
  as shopping, dining and travel. They are also able to put money into an HSBC
  regular savings account paying 5%. Barclays The freebies: no major freebies on
  offer at the time of writing. Interest-free overdraft: up to £1,000 in year
  one (up to £500 during the first term), then up to £1,500 in year two and
  beyond. Anything else? Barclays has been the subject of demonstrations by
  anti-war activists and others. It has been criticised by some for providing
  financial services to defence companies supplying Israel. It says: “Barclays
  provides a range of financial products and services to UK, US and European
  defence companies that supply Nato and its allies … Barclays does not directly
  invest in these companies.” Halifax and Bank of Scotland The freebies: £100
  cashback (down from £110 last year), plus £90 in Deliveroo vouchers (£15 a
  month for six months) provided they make a minimum number of transactions.
  Interest-free overdraft: up to £1,500 in years one to three, and then up to
  £2,000 in years four to six (if applicable). Anything else? With Halifax’s
  Cashback Extras and Bank of Scotland’s Everyday Offers, students can earn up
  to 15% cashback at retailers including Costa Coffee, Just Eat and Sainsbury’s.
  TSB The freebies: no major freebies on offer at the time of writing.
  Interest-free overdraft: £500 in the first six months, rising to £1,000 in
  months seven to nine, and up to £1,500 from month 10. Anything else? Students
  can earn 5% interest on account balances up to £500. They can access offers
  and discounts via the bank’s My Rewards portal. ‘I was sold on the free
  four-year 16-25 railcard’ As a student there will be many mornings where you
  stare lamentably at your bank balance. So you might as well pick an account
  that can offer some respite. In my case it was the Santander Edge student
  current account. I was sold on the free four-year 16-25 railcard. Throughout
  each year at university my railcard has come up trumps in a variety of ways.
  In my first year at university, it made home feel just that little bit closer.
  With a 33% saving on each fare, I was constantly spotted on platform 1 with a
  big bag of laundry. In my second year, my railcard served as a gateway to
  explore more of the country. I’ve ticked off new sporting venues, as well as
  Bristol and Stansted airports. Moving into my final year, as the crunch
  begins, my railcard will act as an enabler to complete valuable internships
  and work experience. My account also comes with a 0% overdraft, which is a
  reassuring presence should any part of university life catch up with me. There
  were a variety of options that didn’t quite capture my eye. NatWest offered a
  tastecard letting you take advantage of restaurant deals and food discounts.
  In my case I found that after the first semester, the likelihood of eating out
  quickly diminishes. Student finance only stretches so far! Other accounts
  offered cashback at certain retailers, which, considering my limited record of
  high street spending, would have been wasted on me. Talking of the high
  street, the fact that there’s a Santander branch in my university town was
  also a factor. My family is still wedded to the chequebook, so a place to
  deposit cheques, even in 2025, is greatly appreciated. Alfie Howlett is
