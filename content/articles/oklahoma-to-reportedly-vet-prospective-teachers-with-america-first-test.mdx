  Oklahoma’s top education official is reportedly introducing a new assessment
  for teachers coming from California and New York that will gauge their
  alignment with the so-called Sooner state’s conservative values. Oklahoma’s
  public education superintendent, Ryan Walters, told USA Today and CNN that the
  50-question certification exam – which is reportedly set to roll out in the
  coming days – will ask about topics such as the “biological differences
  between males and females”, freedom of religion and US history. According to
  USA Today, the test also includes questions related to false claims that
  electoral fraudsters handed the 2020 presidential race to Joe Biden at the
  expense of Donald Trump, who returned to the White House in January. Walters
  said that the test – which he has dubbed the “America First” certification,
  invoking a favored slogan of the Republican president – is intended to ensure
  that teachers from the two largest Democrat-led states “are not coming into
  our classrooms and indoctrinating kids”. He told CNN that while the test will
  apply to teachers coming from California and New York, it could expand in the
  future to applicants from up to eight states who want to work in public
  education in Republican-led Oklahoma. Walters believes that California and New
  York have required teachers to “do things that are antithetical to our
  standards and values as a state” and that the assessment will help ensure
  “that these teachers agree to teach what is required in the state of
  Oklahoma”. The conservative media company PragerU reportedly developed the
  test. The new test comes as Oklahoma, like many US states, faces a teacher
  shortage. In an effort to recruit educators from across the country, USA Today
  reports that Oklahoma is offering bonuses of up to $50,000. Walters claims
  that the state has seen “a dramatic increase in teachers wanting to come to
  Oklahoma”. However, critics argue that the new certification requirement will
  deter teachers from wanting to come to Oklahoma. In an interview with USA
  Today, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers,
  said that the new certification will be a “huge turn-off” to teachers.
  “Teachers in this country are patriotic, and suggesting they’re not is
  insulting,” she said. Alluding to Trump’s “Make America great again” slogan,
  Weingarten added: “Ryan Walters appears to be trying out for Maga in chief,
  not educator in chief, because everything that he’s doing is about the culture
  wars, not about the reading, writing and arithmetic. “If he wants to be Maga
  in chief then go be Maga in chief. But let someone else be educator in chief
  and focus on other things people deserve, which is reading, literacy and
  wraparound services – and actual teachers who want to be in Oklahoma.” Cari
  Elledge, the president of the Oklahoma Education Association, echoed those
  concerns, calling the test “a political stunt to grab attention” and a
  “distraction from the real issues” in the state. Elledge added: “When
  political ideology plays into whether or not you can teach in any place, that
  might be a deterrent to quality educators attempting to get a job.” News about
  the Oklahoma public education system’s America First certification came after
  Walters grappled with allegations from colleagues that they saw images of nude
  women on a television in his office during a closed-door work meeting. Walters
  vehemently denied the allegations. The Oklahoma state house speaker, Kyle
  Hilbert, said that a subsequent preliminary investigation determined that the
  TV at the time was tuned to a channel that was playing a 1985 Jackie Chan film
  named The Protector, which does contain scenes with nudity. Hilbert said that
  finding evidently ruled out intentional display of inappropriate content by
  Walters as well as false reporting by the colleagues, as the Oklahoma news
  outlet KOTV reported.
