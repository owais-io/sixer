  The number of people who joined a pro-Palestine march across Sydney Harbour
  Bridge on Sunday exceeded everyone’s expectations. But just how many braved
  the rainy weather to urge the Australian government to do more to pressure
  Israel to stop the death and destruction in Gaza? That’s been a sticking
  point. New South Wales police said initial estimates put the crowd at 90,000.
  A spokesperson for rally organisers, the Palestine Action Group, said police
  had informed them 100,000 people were in attendance – but the group estimated
  the figure was closer to 300,000. Here’s what we know. What do police and
  protesters say about how many people attended? Just after 5pm on Sunday, the
  acting deputy police commissioner, Peter McKenna, said police estimated 90,000
  people took part – far more than the 50,000 organisers expected. He said it
  was the largest protest he and the assistant police commissioner Adam Johnson
  had seen in their time in the force. Johnson also said it was the “most
  perilous” in his “35 years of policing”. However organisers estimated it was
  closer to 300,000. “It’s even bigger than my wildest dreams,” one of the main
  protest organisers, Josh Lees, said while at the front of the march at the
  midway point. Lees later said a number of people had come up with a similar
  figure after crunching the numbers based on widely shared aerial footage. What
  about an independent expert? Dr Aldo Raineri, a senior Central Queensland
  University lecturer and expert in crowd safety management, estimated the
  figure to be significantly higher than what police suggested. Guardian
  Australia shared drone footage with Raineri that showed the crowd just north
  of the bridge’s midway point, extending back to Wynyard station and Lang Park,
  where the march began. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The distance from
  Wynyard station up to where protesters began to be turned back is
  approximately 2.5km. The roadway along the bridge is 30 metres wide. Based on
  these dimensions and what appeared to be an occupancy of three or four people
  per square metre, he estimated between 225,000 and 300,000 people attended.
  However, he noted “these figures are really rough, given the variation in
  density”. Organisers said there were still people at Lang Park, who had not
  yet started to march, when police sent a message telling protesters to turn
  back. How does Sunday’s march compare with past marches? Lees said many who
  had gone to Sunday’s protest felt it was on par with past major protests they
  had been to, including the anti-Iraq war protest in 2003, which saw
  demonstrators march through the CBD, and the Walk for Reconciliation march in
  2000 which went across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. According to the National
  Museum of Australia, about 250,000 people walked across the bridge in a
  continuous stream lasting nearly six hours during the reconciliation march.
  NMA called it the “largest political demonstration ever held in Australia”. In
  2003, police estimated more than 200,000 took part in the anti-Iraq war rally,
  while organisers put the total at about 300,000, the Sydney Morning Herald
  reported. The paper said it was “thought to be the biggest in the country’s
  history”. In 2023, an estimated 50,000 people took part in a march across the
  Sydney Harbour Bridge as part of WorldPride. Chris Nash, who attended Sunday’s
  march, said it “felt much bigger” than the 2000 reconciliation march he also
  attended. “That was much more spaced out,” he said. The former NSW premier Bob
  Carr marched at the head of the pro-Palestine protest across the bridge. He
  was the premier during the reconciliation march in 2000. Asked how the crowd
  sizes compared, he said: “All that matters was that it was a big, beautiful
  success. A success with cheerful police cooperation and good-natured people
  motivated by the horror of Israel’s actions in Gaza.” How well did police
  handle the huge number of protesters? At about 3pm on Sunday, NSW police sent
  out a mass text message throughout the city ordering the pro-Palestine march
  to stop due to safety concerns, with authorities turning protesters around at
  the north end of the bridge. Police sent a second mass text message saying
  they had consulted with the organisers and were turning everyone around. “We
  could not get those people, the number, the significant size of that crowd off
  that northern egress route without risking crowd crush. We could not allow
  those numbers to then egress into the northern side, into those train stations
  without, again, that real risk of crowd crush,” McKenna told reporters. He
  said there were 1,000 police facilitating the protest. Raineri said allowing
  the crowd to amass without effective transport to disperse them would have
  been unsafe. He said the police went about this the right way by using mass
  text messages and consultating with protesters. However, some marchers told
  Legal Observers NSW they felt the “confusing and unplanned” directions from
  police were dangerous and could have caused a crowd crush. “Police had not
  adequately planned for the initial route to North Sydney and there did not
  appear to be a plan if crowd numbers exceeded expectations and made entering
  and leaving North Sydney difficult,” the group’s report on the protest said.
