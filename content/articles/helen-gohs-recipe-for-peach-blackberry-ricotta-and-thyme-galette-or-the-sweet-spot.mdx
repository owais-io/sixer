  By late summer, peaches are often past their peak for eating raw, being
  perhaps a little floury or shy on juice. That fading sweetness pairs
  beautifully with the first flush of wild blackberries, however, and this
  galette makes the most of that overlap: slices of peach and a handful of
  blackberries sit on a gently sweetened ricotta base that’s flavoured with
  brown sugar, orange zest and a few sprigs of thyme. The ricotta bakes into
  something soft and creamy that catches those juices as the fruits slump.
  Peach, blackberry, ricotta and thyme galette This is best served when barely
  warm, with vanilla ice-cream. Prep 15 min Chill 1 hr+ Cook 1 hr 20 min Serves
  6-8 For the pastry 185g plain flour, plus extra for dusting ¼ tsp fine sea
  salt ⅛ tsp baking powder 120g cold unsalted butter, cubed 85g cream cheese 1-2
  tbsp double cream 2 tsp cider vinegar For the orange ricotta base 150g ricotta
  30g light brown sugar Finely grated zest of 1 orange – save the juice for the
  peaches 1 tsp thyme leaves, finely chopped ⅛ tsp fine sea salt For the peaches
  2 ripe peaches, halved, stoned and each half cut into 8 wedges 2 tbsp caster
  sugar 1 tbsp cornflour 2 tsp orange juice 2 tsp thyme leaves ⅛ tsp fine sea
  salt 100g blackberries, halved if large To glaze 1 small egg, lightly beaten 1
  tbsp demerara sugar To make the pastry, put the flour, salt and baking powder
  in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine and aerate. Add the cubed
  butter and pulse again until it is broken down into small pieces. Add the
  cream cheese and pulse until the mix looks like damp and unevenly sized
  crumbs. Add a tablespoon of the cream and the vinegar, then pulse until the
  mix just starts to come together into a dough (if it doesn’t, pulse in the
  second tablespoon of cream). Tip out the pastry on to a lightly floured work
  surface, gather and press it into one piece, then wrap loosely in clingfilm,
  press to flatten into a disc and refrigerate for at least an hour, and up to
  two days. Once chilled, make the ricotta base by mixing all the ingredients in
  a small bowl. Combine all the ingredients for the peaches except the
  blackberries in a second bowl, toss gently to combine, then set aside. Heat
  the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Take the pastry out of the fridge,
  put it on a large sheet of baking paper, then roll it out evenly into a large,
  roughly 36-38cm-diameter circle that’s about 2mm thick. Don’t worry if the
  edges are irregular; that’s all part of the charm of a galette. Lift the
  baking paper along with the pastry on to a large baking tray, then spread the
  ricotta mix evenly on top, leaving a 4-5cm border all around the edge. Add the
  blackberries to the peach bowl, toss gently, then spoon the fruit on top of
  the ricotta. Carefully draw the border of the pastry up and over the fruit,
  roughly pleating it as you go and leaving the centre of the galette exposed.
  Brush the pastry border with egg wash, then sprinkle with the demerara sugar
  and bake for 40-45 minutes, until golden brown. Leave the galette to rest and
  cool a little, then slice and serve.
