  The Guardian view on RFK Jr’s vaccine cuts: an assault on science from a

  Science is not black and white. It’s more complicated and more exciting. It’s
  a constant process of exploration. An adventure into the unknown. Scientists
  come up with theories about what might be going on, and then test them. They
  don’t always get it right. Far from it. But inch by inch, testing, failing and
  trying again, they make progress. Robert F Kennedy Jr, during Senate
  confirmation hearings for the role of secretary at the Department of Health
  and Human Services (HHS), seemed to get that. Those who feared what a vaccine
  sceptic might do in that role breathed again. “I’m going to empower the
  scientists at HHS to do their job and make sure that we have good science that
  is evidence based … I’m not going to substitute my judgment for science,” he
  said. Yet now, without good explanation or sound science, he is cutting $500m
  of research funding for mRNA vaccines, claiming that they “fail to protect
  effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. In fact,
  no Covid vaccine fully protects against infection, but they have been shown to
  prevent deaths in billions of people. The 22 contracts that will be cancelled
  include one with Moderna for a vaccine against bird flu, which many fear could
  trigger the next human pandemic (and there will be one). Instead, federal
  funds will go to vaccines developed in more traditional ways. Either Mr
  Kennedy lied to Congress or he has a different understanding of science and
  evidence from most scientists, unpicking what they thought was uncontestable.
  The childhood vaccine schedule is being reconsidered, and mandating the
  measles vaccine is being questioned in spite of fatal outbreaks in the US. He
  has sacked the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory panel and replaced
  it with many people known to have sceptical views. Mr Kennedy is particularly
  hostile to the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19, panning them in 2021 as the
  “deadliest vaccines in history”, wrongly claiming that half those suffering
  the rare side-effect of myocarditis would die or need heart transplants within
  five years. The vast majority have quickly recovered. Until 2023, he chaired
  an anti-vaccine organisation called Children’s Health Defense, where he
  petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to rescind the licence of all
  Covid-19 vaccines and compared mandating vaccines to Nazi oppression in the
  second world war. This is the stuff of internet scares; labyrinthine tangles
  of misinformation dotted with odd inaccurate nuggets of quasi-science. It
  doesn’t compare with the evidence base for mRNA vaccines, which went through
  clinical trials on hundreds of thousands of people and have since been used to
  vaccinate billions. Experts agree that the mRNA vaccines were a stunning
  breakthrough that allowed people to be protected in record time from Covid-19.
  They contain messenger RNA, a tiny bit of genetic code that teaches the immune
  system to fight the virus. No need to grow the virus in hen’s eggs, which
  takes months. The “plug and play” technology can be adapted against other
  viruses, such as flu, including some that devastate populations in poor
  countries. The inventors won the Nobel prize in 2023. Mr Kennedy’s
  cancellation of funding not only stymies much research but also feeds
  worldwide doubt in mRNA vaccines. We are all the losers. Humanity needs these
  vaccines. Other countries need to step up with money and reassurance to try to
  heal this latest breach between science and nonsense. And Mr Kennedy is
  clearly unfit for the job he holds. Do you have an opinion on the issues
