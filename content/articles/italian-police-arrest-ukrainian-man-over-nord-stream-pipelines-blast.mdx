  A Ukrainian man alleged to have been involved in the 2022 detonation of the
  Nord Stream pipelines carrying gas from Russia to Germanyhas been arrested in
  Italy, according to German authorities. The man, identified only as Serhiy K,
  is believed to have been onboard the sailing boat from where the attack was
  allegedly carried out. Carabinieri arrested him on Wednesday evening near
  Rimini after a European arrest warrant was issued on Monday, Germany’s federal
  prosecutor’s office (GBA) said on Thursday. The attacks on the pipelines,
  which were not in use, were carried out on 26 September 2022 and damaged them
  apparently beyond repair. Investigators have long suspected a Ukrainian
  commando operation. Divers are believed to have been taken there by the
  chartered sailing yacht Andromeda, which set off from the German port of
  Rostock to the area close to the pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm,
  where they planted explosives on the sea bed. Serhiy K is thought to have been
  onboard. Investigators do not believe he was one of the divers, but he is
  thought to have had a leading role as a coordinator of what appeared to have
  been a well-planned operation. The yacht was hired with the help of
  intermediaries and using forged identity papers, from a German company,
  according to prosecutors. The incident has been under investigation since 2022
  by the GBA, which said it intended to charge any suspects with
  anti-constitutional sabotage and causing an explosion. During extensive media
  investigations, in particular by the news magazine Der Spiegel, people who
  allegedly had detailed knowledge of the incident said the commandos had not
  intended to commit a crime. Instead, they had considered it an attack on a
  legitimate military target due to Russia’s war on Ukraine, not least because
  the profits from gas deliveries to Germany had contributed significantly to
  financing Moscow’s war. Spiegel’s research revealed evidence suggesting the
  action had been sanctioned by the Ukrainian armed forces, although this has
  been denied by Kyiv. German prosecutors have not said when they expect Serhiy
  K to be extradited to face German authorities. Separate investigations by
  Swedish and Danish authorities were closed in February 2024, leaving German
  authorities to continue their inquiries alone. At one point Russia accused the
  US of being behind the sabotage, following Washington’s criticism of Germany’s
  dependence on Russian gas. Another initial strong assumption was that the
  perpetrators were Russian – but investigators traced the yacht and discovered
  its connection to Ukraine. Like Kyiv, Washington and Moscow denied the
  allegations. Last year Germany’s federal prosecutor general, Jens Rommel,
  secured an initial arrest warrant against one of the suspected divers.
  However, the suspect left his home in Poland before he could be arrested after
  Polish authorities allegedly warned Ukrainian authorities in advance. The man
  is believed to have driven into Ukraine in a car with diplomatic licence
  plates, according to Spiegel. Separately on Thursday, the Georgian captain of
  an oil tanker that damaged undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 after his
  vessel dragged along the sea bed for about 55 miles has denied wrongdoing,
  calling the incident a “maritime accident”. Davit Vadatchkoria and the first
  and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker are to face charges in a
  Helsinki court on Monday over the slicing of power and telecommunications
  cables as their vessel travelled westwards in the Gulf of Finland, having
  departed from a Russian oil port. “We are innocent. It’s only a maritime
  accident,” Vadatchkoria, who is being detained in Finland, told the Finnish
  public broadcaster YLE on Thursday.
