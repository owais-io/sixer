  Aston Villa are close to making the Nice forward Evann Guessand their first
  major summer signing. Villa have agreed a package worth €35m (£30.5m) for the
  Ivory Coast international. Villa have scheduled a medical for Guessand on
  Wednesday and plan to sign the 24-year-old to a long-term contract. The
  France-born player scored 12 goals in 32 appearances in Ligue 1 last season
  and scored his first international goal in March. His arrival would be a boost
  to Unai Emery’s attacking options, with Ollie Watkins the only bona fide
  striker in the Villa squad. Like Donyell Malen, Guessand’s versatility makes
  him an attractive option for Villa. Villa have had to be mindful of
  profitability and sustainability regulations this summer and their only other
  first-team signing so far is the experienced goalkeeper Marco Bizot, who was
  recruited as a No 2 from Brest. Zépiqueno Redmond, signed from Feyenoord,
  could depart on loan. Uncertainty continues to surround Emiliano Martínez, who
  is thought to be keen on exploring a fresh challenge. Watkins has been the
  subject of interest from rivals but Villa do not wish to sell. Villa also want
  to trim their squad and offload fringe players such as Àlex Moreno and Leander
  Dendoncker. Meanwhile, the Liverpool midfielder Tyler Morton has joined Lyon
  in a £15m deal. The 22-year-old, who came through the academy ranks at
  Liverpool, had interest from several European and Premier League clubs this
  summer but opted to pursue more regular first-team football in France.
  Liverpool have also negotiated a 20% sell-on clause in any future transfer.
  The Premier League champions are well stocked in central midfield and Morton’s
  opportunities may have been further limited next season by the return of
  Stefan Bajcetic, plus the development of James McConnell and Luca Stephenson.
