  That’s all from the Middle East crisis live blog for today. Thanks for
  following along. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines: Israel hammered
  Gaza City and its outskirts overnight, residents said Thursday, after the
  defence ministry approved an expanded offensive to target the remaining Hamas
  strongholds in the strip. The newly approved plan authorises the call-up of
  roughly 60,000 reservists, deepening fears the campaign will worsen the
  already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory.
  Israel’s plans to expand the fighting and seize Gaza City have sparked
  international outcry as well as domestic opposition. The Red Cross became the
  latest voice to condemn the plan on Thursday, calling it “intolerable”.
  Relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have urged Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  government to accept a proposed ceasefire deal, saying a failure to do so is
  “a death sentence for the living hostages and a sentence of disappearance for
  the deceased ones.” In Gaza City, thousands of Palestinians have left their
  homes as Israeli forces have escalated shelling on the Sabra and Tuffah
  neighbourhoods. Some families have left for shelters along the coast, while
  others have moved to central and southern parts of the enclave, according to
  residents there. Children suffering from malnutrition in Gaza could die if
  emergency provisions are not immediately put in place during Israel’s Gaza
  City military operation, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency has
  warned. UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini said its data showed a
  six-fold increase in the number of children suffering from malnutrition in
  Gaza City since March. Israeli citizen Saleh Abu-Hussein, who was detained in
  Lebanon for about a year, has returned to Israel following negotiations with
  the help of the Red Cross, the Israeli prime minister’s office has said. The
  prime minister’s office did not disclose details on the circumstances of the
  citizen’s detention, according to Reuters. Armed Palestinian groups in
  Lebanese refugee camps will start handing over their weapons to the
  authorities on Thursday, a joint committee said, following a deal reached in
  May. “Today marks the beginning of the first phase of the process of handing
  over weapons from inside the Palestinian camps,” Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue
  Committee chairman Ramez Dimashkieh said in a statement. The UK’s Foreign
  Office has summoned Israeli ambassador Tzipi Hotovely over Tel Aviv’s approval
  of a major settlement plan in the West Bank. Turkish port authorities have
  begun informally requiring shipping agents to provide letters declaring that
  vessels are not linked to Israel and not carrying military or hazardous cargo
  bound for the country, according to two shipping sources. The move is another
  step Turkey has taken against Israel after it last year severed trade with the
  country, worth $7bn (£5.20bn) annually, over its war in Gaza with Palestinian
  militant group Hamas. The UK has called on Israel to allow foreign journalists
  to enter Gaza as Tel Aviv prepares to step up military operations in the
  territory. In a statement alongside 25 other members of the Media Freedom
  Coalition, the UK urged Israel to “allow immediate independent foreign media
  access and afford protection for journalists operating in Gaza”. Britain
  imposed sanctions on one individual and four entities on Wednesday under its
  Iran sanctions regime, saying they are part of a network that supports
  Tehran’s overseas activities, including in Ukraine and Israel. The sanctions
  include an asset freeze on Iranian oil magnate Hossein Shamkhani, and on four
  companies operating in the shipping, petrochemical and financial sectors,
  according to a government notice published online. Iranian state television
  report said the nation’s first millitary exercise since the 12-day war with
  Israel involved a frigate IRIS Sabalan and a smaller vessel, the IRIS Ganaveh,
  which launched Nasir and Qadir cruise missiles at targets in the sea, striking
  them. Coastal batteries also opened fire as part of the exercise. A group of
  17 US Senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday
  calling for the United States to press Israel to grant access and protection
  to journalists in Gaza. The letter comes one week after an Israeli strike
  killed a group of Palestinian journalists in the besieged territory. Follow
  all the latest news from the Middle East here. Palestinian women check the
  destruction after Israeli military strikes in a tent camp for displaced people
  near Al-Aqsa Hospital, in Deir al-Balah. The UK’s Foreign Office has summoned
  Israeli ambassador Tzipi Hotovely over Tel Aviv’s approval of a major
  settlement plan in the West Bank. More to follow as we get it. Israel
  announced on Wednesday it had begun its offensive in Gaza, which could
  displace one million Palestinians. The newly approved plan authorises the
  call-up of roughly 60,000 reservists, deepening fears the campaign will worsen
  the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory.
  Iran launched its first military exercise since the end of its 12-day war with
  Israel, state television reported Thursday, with navy vessels launching
  missiles at targets at sea in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. While
  such drills are routine in the Islamic Republic, the “Sustainable Power 1404”
  exercise comes as authorities in Iran are trying to project strength in the
  wake of a war that saw Israel destroy air defense systems and bomb nuclear
  facilities and other sites, AP reported. The state TV report said the frigate
  IRIS Sabalan and a smaller vessel, the IRIS Ganaveh, launched Nasir and Qadir
  cruise missiles at targets in the sea, striking them. Coastal batteries also
  opened fire as part of the exercise. Iran’s navy, estimated to have some
  18,000 personnel, apparently avoided any major attack during the June war. The
  UK has called on Israel to allow foreign journalists to enter Gaza as Tel Aviv
  prepares to step up military operations in the territory. In a statement
  alongside 25 other members of the Media Freedom Coalition, the UK urged Israel
  to “allow immediate independent foreign media access and afford protection for
  journalists operating in Gaza”. The coalition said: “Journalists and media
  workers play an essential role in putting the spotlight on the devastating
  reality of war. Access to conflict zones is vital to carrying out this role
  effectively, PA Media reported. “We oppose all attempts to restrict press
  freedom and block entry to journalists during conflicts. “We also strongly
  condemn all violence directed against journalists and media workers,
  especially the extremely high number of fatalities, arrests and detentions.”
  Foreign media have been banned from entering Gaza since October 2023, other
  than for brief, tightly controlled trips escorted by the Israeli military,
  while numerous Palestinian journalists in the region have been killed.
  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 184 journalists and
  other media workers have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the
  renewal of hostilities in 2023. Armed Palestinian groups in Lebanese refugee
  camps will start handing over their weapons to the authorities on Thursday, a
  joint committee said, following a deal reached in May. “Today marks the
  beginning of the first phase of the process of handing over weapons from
  inside the Palestinian camps,” Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee
  chairman Ramez Dimashkieh said in a statement. The process would begin with
  the Burj al-Barajneh camp in Beirut, where an initial batch of weapons would
  be delivered and placed in the custody of the Lebanese army, he added. Later
  on Thursday, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote on X that the
  military had started making what he said were initial warning calls to medical
  and international organisations operating in Gaza’s north, telling them that
  Gaza City residents should start to prepare to move out of the city and
  towards the south. Adraee shared a recording of what he said was an Israeli
  officer telling a Gazan health ministry official that hospitals in southern
  Gaza should also prepare to receive patients from medical facilities in the
  north, who will be forced to evacuate. Reuters couldn’t independently verify
  the authenticity of the call, although the Israeli military has in the past
  contacted officials and civilians in Gaza to warn them to relocate. Turkish
  port authorities have begun informally requiring shipping agents to provide
  letters declaring that vessels are not linked to Israel and not carrying
  military or hazardous cargo bound for the country, according to two shipping
  sources. The move is another step Turkey has taken against Israel after it
  last year severed trade with the country, worth $7bn (£5.20bn) annually, over
  its war in Gaza with Palestinian militant group Hamas. The sources said the
  harbour master’s office had verbally instructed port agents to provide written
  assurances, adding that there was no official circular on the issue. One of
  the sources said the instruction applied to ports across Turkey. Christian
  Cardon, chief spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross
  (ICRC), told AFP: “The intensification of hostilities in Gaza means more
  killing, more displacement, more destruction and more panic. “Gaza is a closed
  space, from which nobody can escape... and where access to health care, food
  and safe water is dwindling,” said Cardon. “Meanwhile, the security of
  humanitarians is getting worse by the hour,” the spokesman added. Read our
  analysis of whether Israel has begun its Gaza City offensive or will there be
  yet more ‘approvals’. Despite daily announcements about its plan, Israel knows
  any major new campaign will have serious consequences. Learn more here:
  Britain imposed sanctions on one individual and four entities on Wednesday
  under its Iran sanctions regime, saying they are part of a network that
  supports Tehran’s overseas activities, including in Ukraine and Israel. The
  sanctions include an asset freeze on Iranian oil magnate Hossein Shamkhani,
  and on four companies operating in the shipping, petrochemical and financial
  sectors, according to a government notice published online. Britain said the
  network had facilitated hostile activity by the Iranian government, including
  efforts to destabilise the UK and other countries. Some of the companies were
  cited for acting on behalf of or at the direction of Shamkhani, who is accused
  of aiding Iran’s overseas operations. Shamkhani was also sanctioned by the
  United States last month. The sanctions freeze any UK-based assets and bar
  British individuals and businesses from dealing with the designated parties.
  Further to comments made here, UNRWA’s commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini
  has accused Israel of using “food as a weapon of war”, saying “it is a
  manufactured and fabricated famine.” Relatives of Israeli hostages held in
  Gaza have urged Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to accept a proposed ceasefire
  deal saying a failure to do so is “a death sentence for the living hostages
  and a sentence of disappearance for the deceased ones.” “History is repeating
  itself,” said Lishay Miran Lavi, wife of Omri Miran, who is thought to be
  alive. “There’s an agreement on the table that can save living hostages and
  bring deceased ones back for a proper burial. Hamas has agreed but the prime
  minister’s office is toiling to decree a death sentence for the living
  hostages and a sentence of disappearance for the deceased ones.” Hamas agreed
  earlier this week to a 60-day ceasefire that would reportedly free 10 living
  hostages. Netanyahu has insisted on a comprehensive deal to end the war and
  has not convened his cabinet to discuss the 60-day truce. Children suffering
  from malnutrition in Gaza could die if emergency provisions are not
  immediately put in place during Israel’s Gaza City military operation, the
  head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency has warned. UNRWA
  commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini said its data showed a six-fold
  increase in the number of children suffering from malnutrition in Gaza City
  since March. “We have a population that is extremely weak that will be
  confronted with a new major military operation,” he said in comments reported
  by Reuters. “Many will simply not have the strength to undergo a new
  displacement.” “If there is no crisis plan, then they will certainly be
  condemned,” he said. Israeli citizen Saleh Abu-Hussein, who was detained in
  Lebanon for about a year, has returned to Israel following negotiations with
  the help of the Red Cross, the Israeli prime minister’s office has said. The
  prime minister’s office did not disclose details on the circumstances of the
  citizen’s detention, according to Reuters. Israel’s plans to expand the
  fighting and seize Gaza City have sparked international outcry as well as
  domestic opposition. The Red Cross became the latest voice to condemn the plan
  on Thursday, calling it “intolerable”. The UN humanitarian agency has warned
  the Israeli plan to expand military operations in Gaza City would have “a
  horrific humanitarian impact” on the already exhausted population. “Forcing
  hundreds of thousands to move south is a recipe for further disaster and could
  amount to forcible transfer,” OCHA said. The UN Human Rights office in the
  Palestinian territories also voiced concern. “Hundreds of families have been
  forced to flee, including many children, persons with disabilities, and older
  people, with nowhere safe to go,” it said. Others reportedly “remain trapped,
  completely cut off from food, water and medicine supplies”, it added. Has
  Israel begun its offensive to conquer Gaza City or is it hype? Following
  several weeks of threats of a new large-scale offensive, strongly opposed by
  the majority of the international community, Israeli officials have daily made
  announcements saying the plan to conquer Gaza City has been “approved”. It has
  been approved by the IDF, by the security cabinet, by defence minister Israel
  Katz. Later today, in an event with the Israeli military, prime minister
  Benjamin Netanyahu will proffer his “approval”. How many times, one is tempted
  to ask, does one plan need approving? As so often in dealing with Israeli
  officials, and Netanyahu in particular, filtering out what is true, what is
  lies, and what is calculated misdirection is a complicated business. While
  Reuters reported a junior defence spokesman as suggesting that the operation
  to take Gaza City had begun, quotes from that briefing paint a more complex
  picture, including a reference to the second phase of Operation Gideon’s
  Chariots, the Israeli military offensive that began several months ago. In
  reality, however, recent military activity in Gaza was depicted as being
  “preliminary” to any new offensive. For his part, Netanyahu’s office put out
  an opaque statement saying he had asked for planning timelines for the
  conquest of Gaza City to be accelerated. Given the profound divisions within
  Israeli society, with some 400,000 demonstrating recently in favour of a
  ceasefire deal and release of the remaining 20 living hostages in Gaza, and
  continued contacts between mediators and both Israel and Hamas, unpacking the
  politics of what Netanyahu is up to is complex. On the one hand, far right
  members of his coalition have threatened (once again) to walk away in the
  event of a ceasefire, demanding the conquest of all of Gaza and Jewish
  settlement of the coastal strip. On the other is the fact that ceasefire talks
  are continuing. Earlier this week Hamas said it had accepted a ceasefire
  proposal that would see the release of some 10 living hostages in the first
  phase of the a 60 day pause, while senior Israeli officials (but not an
  official “delegation”) have met with mediators even as Netanyahu has dragged
  his feet over giving Israel’s reply, reportedly delaying a cabinet meeting
  where it would have been discussed. All of which leaves big questions
  unanswered . While some Israeli and international analysts have speculated
  that the current moves on the ground amount to pressure on Hamas to improve
  any deal that might just be emerging, others – like Ronen Bergman, one of
  Israel’s most authoritative security analysts – suggest that Netanyahu would
  like to push on with fighting for years if possible, in order to delay his
  ongoing legal cases and ensure his continued political survival. What most
  agree is that any new major campaign is likely to have serious consequences.
  For Israelis, including senior figures in the defence establishment, one
  concern is whether living hostages would survive, an issue motivating the mass
  demonstrations. Others point out that to all intents and purposes the deal
  Hamas has agreed to is one Israel signalled its agreement for only weeks ago.
  Any offensive would be seen by the international community for what it is, the
  most cynical of moves leading to an even deeper humanitarian catastrophe - if
  that can even be imagined. Without much military utility, and diplomatically
  self harming, the suspicion then must be that much of this – for now at least
  – is deliberately performative, though even veteran Israeli analysts are
  puzzled to what end. To buy time for Netanyahu to flip flop again about what
  he sees as the objectives of the war? In the hope that Egyptian pressure on
  Hamas will provide a deal that can be sold? Or perhaps Netanyahu, like a
  modern day Macbeth, can no longer see a way forward or a way back, “in blood
  stepped in so far that should I wade no more returning were as tedious as go
  o’er.” In Gaza City, thousands of Palestinians have left their homes as
  Israeli forces have escalated shelling on the Sabra and Tuffah neighbourhoods.
  Some families have left for shelters along the coast, while others have moved
  to central and southern parts of the enclave, according to residents there.
  “We are facing a bitter-bitter situation, to die at home or leave and die
  somewhere else, as long as this war continues, survival is uncertain,” said
  Rabah Abu Elias, 67, a father of seven. “In the news, they speak about a
  possible truce, on the ground, we only hear explosions and see deaths. To
  leave Gaza City or not isn’t an easy decision to make,” he told Reuters by
  phone. Israeli tanks have been edging closer to densely populated Gaza City
  over the past ten days. Israeli officials have said evacuation notices would
  be issued to Palestinians there before the military moves in. Two more people
  have died of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the
  territory’s health ministry said on Thursday. The new deaths raised the number
  of Palestinians who have died from such causes to 271, including 112 children,
  since the war began. Iran was seeking to reassert an image of strength on
  Thursday after suffering heavy losses, when Israel largely destroyed Iran’s
  air defences during the war and much of its stockpile of ballistic weapons is
  believed to have been damaged by Israeli strikes. The Iranian Defence Ministry
  said in a statement on Thursday: “Any new adventure by the enemy will be faced
  with a strong slap.” Navy units of Iran’s regular armed forces fired missiles
  and drones at open water targets in the Indian Ocean under the “Sustainable
  Power 1404” drill, state television reported. “These drills take place around
  a month after the Iran-Russia drill under the name Casarex 2025 which took
  place in Iran’s northern waters (Caspian Sea). The Sustainable Power
  drills...are in Iran’s southern waters,” state TV said. Iranian state
  television report said the nation’s first millitary exercise since the 12-day
  war with Israel involved a frigate IRIS Sabalan and a smaller vessel, the IRIS
  Ganaveh, which launched Nasir and Qadir cruise missiles at targets in the sea,
  striking them. Coastal batteries also opened fire as part of the exercise.
  Benjamin Netanyahu has ignored pleas from Australian Jewish groups to calm his
  feud with Anthony Albanese, further criticising the prime minister and
  escalating an ugly spat between the two leaders. Australia’s peak Jewish
  group, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), on Wednesday labelled
  Israeli prime minister Netanyahu’s attack on Albanese as “inflammatory and
  provocative”, and a “clumsy intervention” which had affected Australia’s
  Jewish community. ECAJ’s president, Daniel Aghion, wrote letters to both
  leaders, critical of the conduct of Albanese and Netanyahu and urging a
  resolution “in the usual way through diplomacy rather than public posturing”.
  The group’s co-executive, Alex Ryvchin, had additionally called for “both
  governments to remember what’s at stake to ensure that calm heads prevail and
  to conduct their matters of state privately, diplomatically”. But in a new
  interview with Sky News, Netanyahu again labelled Albanese “weak”. Read the
  full story here: Israel hammered Gaza City and its outskirts overnight,
  residents said Thursday, after the defence ministry approved an expanded
  offensive to target the remaining Hamas strongholds in the strip. The newly
  approved plan authorises the call-up of roughly 60,000 reservists, deepening
  fears the campaign will worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in
  the Palestinian territory. “We are not waiting. We have begun the preliminary
  actions, and already now, IDF (army) troops are holding the outskirts of Gaza
  City,” the Israeli military said in a statement. Israel’s plans to expand the
  fighting and take control of Gaza City have sparked international outcry as
  well as domestic opposition. Ahead of the offensive, the Israeli military said
  the call-up of the reservists would begin in early September. Gaza City
  residents described relentless bombardments overnight. “The house shakes with
  us all night long - the sound of explosions, artillery, warplanes, ambulances,
  and cries for help is killing us,” one of them, Ahmad al-Shanti, told AFP.
  “The sound is getting closer, but where would we go?”. Iran publicly hanged a
  convicted murderer at the scene of his alleged crime on Thursday, the
  judiciary said, just two days after another public execution. Most executions
  in Iran are carried out inside prisons. Public executions are generally
  reserved for offences that caused particular outrage. The latest hanging was
  carried out at dawn in the city of Kordkuy “at the scene of the crime and in
  public”, provincial judiciary chief Heidar Asiabi told the judiciary’s Mizan
  Online news website. The condemned man had been convicted of killing “a couple
  and a young woman with a hunting rifle” late last year, Mizan reported. Nine
  students in Gaza with full scholarships to study at British universities have
  been told the UK government is working to facilitate their evacuation. The
  students – who have all been awarded Chevening scholarships, funded by the
  Foreign Office in recognition of their potential as future leaders – welcomed
  the development on Wednesday, but dozens more Palestinians in Gaza with
  university places are still awaiting news. The breakthrough follows months of
  advocacy and campaigning by more than 100 MPs, university leaders and other
  civil society organisations. More than 80 Palestinian students in total have
  offers at UK universities, including 40 who have secured full scholarships. Dr
  Nora Parr, a researcher at the University of Birmingham who has been
  coordinating efforts to support the students, said: “We received news of the
  government plans with mixed emotions. On the one hand, relief that indeed
  there is a shared sense of the importance and urgency of the students’
  situation – and on the other our hearts sank. What about the rest? We must
  believe that this is only a start.” Read the full report here: Iran launched
  its first military exercise since the end of its 12-day war with Israel, state
  television reported on Thursday, with navy vessels launching missiles at
  targets at sea in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. While such drills are
  routine in the Islamic Republic, the “Sustainable Power 1404” exercise comes
  as authorities in Iran are trying to project strength in the wake of a war
  that saw Israel destroy air defence systems and bomb nuclear facilities and
  other sites. The state TV report said naval vessels would fire cruise missiles
  at targets and use drones over the open water. It did not immediately air any
  footage from the exercise. Iran’s navy, estimated to have 18,000 personnel,
  apparently avoided any major attack during the June war. The navy, based out
  of the port city of Bandar Abbas, patrols the Gulf of Oman, the Indian Ocean
  and the Caspian Sea, and broadly leaves the Persian Gulf and its narrow mouth,
  the strait of Hormuz, to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Here are
  some of the latest images from Gaza: A group of 17 US Senators sent a letter
  to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday calling for the United States
  to press Israel to grant access and protection to journalists in Gaza. The
  letter comes one week after an Israeli strike killed a group of Palestinian
  journalists in the besieged territory. “The United States must make it clear
  to Israel that banning and censoring media organizations and targeting or
  threatening members of the press is unacceptable and must stop,” the
  Democratic senators said in a statement. The letter to Rubio, a staunch
  supporter of Israel, said: “We urge you to press the Israeli government to
  protect journalists in Gaza and allow international media to access the
  territory.” Last week, an Israeli strike killed four journalists for Al
  Jazeera, including Qatari television correspondent Anas al-Sharif, as well as
  two freelance journalists. Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war
  and wider Middle East crisis. The Israeli military has announced the first
  steps of an operation to take over Gaza City and said it was calling up an
  extra 60,000 reservists for the offensive. It came as the government
  considered a new ceasefire proposal that Hamas has agreed on to pause the war
  and, separately, Israel approved a huge new illegal settlement in the West
  Bank. Military spokesperson Effie Defrin said on Wednesday the Israel Defense
  Forces had “begun the preliminary operations and the first stages of the
  attack on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding the outskirts of
  Gaza City”. Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters in Gaza on Wednesday
  and Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said later that the prime minister had sped up
  the timeline for taking control of Hamas strongholds and defeating the
  militant group. UN secretary general António Guterres on Thursday called for
  an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, saying it was necessary “to avoid the death
  and destruction that a military operation against Gaza City would inevitably
  cause”. In other key developments: Israeli defence minister Israel Katz’s
  order to send more troops into Gaza City came despite international criticism
  of the offensive, with fears of significant casualties and more mass
  displacement amid widening conditions of starvation in the territory. The
  situation in Gaza City was “catastrophic” and “large numbers” were fleeing
  eastern neighbourhoods, according to the Gaza municipality’s emergency
  committee chief, Mustafa Qazzaat. Resident Anis Daloul, 64, told the AFP news
  agency the Israeli military had “destroyed most of the buildings in Zeitoun
  and displaced thousands of people”. The additional Israeli reserve soldiers
  would not report for duty until September, a military official said on
  Wednesday, giving mediators time to bridge gaps between Hamas and Israel over
  the terms of any ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas said Israel’s plans to
  conquer Gaza City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts to broker a
  truce. The Israeli talk of a large-scale operation could primarily be intended
  to put pressure on the militant group in ceasefire talks, reports Peter
  Beaumont. More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli war in
  Gaza since Hamas’s deadly attacks in October 2023, according to Gaza health
  officials. British UK foreign secretary David Lammy condemned Israel’s
  approval of the new settlement block in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of
  international law”. The plan would split the West Bank into two with the
  intention – Israeli far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich has said – of ending
  any prospect of a Palestinian state. The Israeli military said on Thursday it
  has received a report about a security incident near the settlement of
  Malachei HaShalom in the West Bank, adding that details were under review.

That’s all from the Middle East crisis live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines: Israel hammered Gaza City and its outskirts overnight, residents said Thursday, after the defence ministry approved an expanded offensive to target the remaining Hamas strongholds in the strip.

Turkish port authorities have begun informally requiring shipping agents to provide letters declaring that vessels are not linked to Israel and not carrying military or hazardous cargo bound for the country, according to two shipping sources. The move is another step Turkey has taken against Israel after it last year severed trade with the country, worth $7bn (£5.20bn) annually, over its war in Gaza with Palestinian militant group Hamas. The UK has called on Israel to allow foreign journalists to enter Gaza as Tel Aviv prepares to step up military operations in the territory.

Coastal batteries also opened fire as part of the exercise. Iran’s navy, estimated to have some 18,000 personnel, apparently avoided any major attack during the June war. The UK has called on Israel to allow foreign journalists to enter Gaza as Tel Aviv prepares to step up military operations in the territory. In a statement alongside 25 other members of the Media Freedom Coalition, the UK urged Israel to “allow immediate independent foreign media access and afford protection for journalists operating in Gaza”. The coalition said: “Journalists and media workers play an essential role in putting the spotlight on the devastating reality of war. Access to conflict zones is vital to carrying out this role effectively, PA Media reported. “We oppose all attempts to restrict press freedom and block entry to journalists during conflicts. “We also strongly condemn all violence directed against journalists and media workers, especially the extremely high number of fatalities, arrests and detentions.” Foreign media have been banned from entering Gaza since October 2023, other than for brief, tightly controlled trips escorted by the Israeli military, while numerous Palestinian journalists in the region have been killed. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 184 journalists and other media workers have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the renewal of hostilities in 2023. Armed Palestinian groups in Lebanese refugee camps will start handing over their weapons to the authorities on Thursday, a joint committee said, following a deal reached in May. “Today marks the beginning of the first phase of the process of handing over weapons from inside the Palestinian camps,” Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee chairman Ramez Dimashkieh said in a statement. The process would begin with the Burj al-Barajneh camp in Beirut, where an initial batch of weapons would be delivered and placed in the custody of the Lebanese army, he added. Later on Thursday, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote on X that the military had started making what he said were initial warning calls to medical and international organisations operating in Gaza’s north, telling them that Gaza City residents should start to prepare to move out of the city and towards the south. Adraee shared a recording of what he said was an Israeli officer telling a Gazan health ministry official that hospitals in southern Gaza should also prepare to receive patients from medical facilities in the north, who will be forced to evacuate. Reuters couldn’t independently verify the authenticity of the call, although the Israeli military has in the past contacted officials and civilians in Gaza to warn them to relocate. Turkish port authorities have begun informally requiring shipping agents to provide letters declaring that vessels are not linked to Israel and not carrying military or hazardous cargo bound for the country, according to two shipping sources. The move is another step Turkey has taken against Israel after it last year severed trade with the country, worth $7bn (£5.20bn) annually, over its war in Gaza with Palestinian militant group Hamas. The sources said the harbour master’s office had verbally instructed port agents to provide written assurances, adding that there was no official circular on the issue. One of the sources said the instruction applied to ports across Turkey. Christian Cardon, chief spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told AFP: “The intensification of hostilities in Gaza means more killing, more displacement, more destruction and more panic. “Gaza is a closed space, from which nobody can escape... and where access to health care, food and safe water is dwindling,” said Cardon. “Meanwhile, the security of humanitarians is getting worse by the hour,” the spokesman added.

Despite daily announcements about its plan, Israel knows any major new campaign will have serious consequences.

The sanctions include an asset freeze on Iranian oil magnate Hossein Shamkhani, and on four companies operating in the shipping, petrochemical and financial sectors, according to a government notice published online. Britain said the network had facilitated hostile activity by the Iranian government, including efforts to destabilise the UK and other countries. Some of the companies were cited for acting on behalf of or at the direction of Shamkhani, who is accused of aiding Iran’s overseas operations. Shamkhani was also sanctioned by the United States last month. The sanctions freeze any UK-based assets and bar British individuals and businesses from dealing with the designated parties. Further to comments made here, UNRWA’s commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini has accused Israel of using “food as a weapon of war”, saying “it is a manufactured and fabricated famine.” Relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have urged Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to accept a proposed ceasefire deal saying a failure to do so is “a death sentence for the living hostages and a sentence of disappearance for the deceased ones.” “History is repeating itself,” said Lishay Miran Lavi, wife of Omri Miran, who is thought to be alive. “There’s an agreement on the table that can save living hostages and bring deceased ones back for a proper burial. Hamas has agreed but the prime minister’s office is toiling to decree a death sentence for the living hostages and a sentence of disappearance for the deceased ones.” Hamas agreed earlier this week to a 60-day ceasefire that would reportedly free 10 living hostages. Netanyahu has insisted on a comprehensive deal to end the war and has not convened his cabinet to discuss the 60-day truce. Children suffering from malnutrition in Gaza could die if emergency provisions are not immediately put in place during Israel’s Gaza City military operation, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency has warned. UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini said its data showed a six-fold increase in the number of children suffering from malnutrition in Gaza City since March. “We have a population that is extremely weak that will be confronted with a new major military operation,” he said in comments reported by Reuters. “Many will simply not have the strength to undergo a new displacement.” “If there is no crisis plan, then they will certainly be condemned,” he said. Israeli citizen Saleh Abu-Hussein, who was detained in Lebanon for about a year, has returned to Israel following negotiations with the help of the Red Cross, the Israeli prime minister’s office has said. The prime minister’s office did not disclose details on the circumstances of the citizen’s detention, according to Reuters. Israel’s plans to expand the fighting and seize Gaza City have sparked international outcry as well as domestic opposition. The Red Cross became the latest voice to condemn the plan on Thursday, calling it “intolerable”. The UN humanitarian agency has warned the Israeli plan to expand military operations in Gaza City would have “a horrific humanitarian impact” on the already exhausted population. “Forcing hundreds of thousands to move south is a recipe for further disaster and could amount to forcible transfer,” OCHA said. The UN Human Rights office in the Palestinian territories also voiced concern. “Hundreds of families have been forced to flee, including many children, persons with disabilities, and older people, with nowhere safe to go,” it said. Others reportedly “remain trapped, completely cut off from food, water and medicine supplies”, it added. Has Israel begun its offensive to conquer Gaza City or is it hype? Following several weeks of threats of a new large-scale offensive, strongly opposed by the majority of the international community, Israeli officials have daily made announcements saying the plan to conquer Gaza City has been “approved”. It has been approved by the IDF, by the security cabinet, by defence minister Israel Katz. Later today, in an event with the Israeli military, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will proffer his “approval”. How many times, one is tempted to ask, does one plan need approving? As so often in dealing with Israeli officials, and Netanyahu in particular, filtering out what is true, what is lies, and what is calculated misdirection is a complicated business. While Reuters reported a junior defence spokesman as suggesting that the operation to take Gaza City had begun, quotes from that briefing paint a more complex picture, including a reference to the second phase of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, the Israeli military offensive that began several months ago. In reality, however, recent military activity in Gaza was depicted as being “preliminary” to any new offensive. For his part, Netanyahu’s office put out an opaque statement saying he had asked for planning timelines for the conquest of Gaza City to be accelerated. Given the profound divisions within Israeli society, with some 400,000 demonstrating recently in favour of a ceasefire deal and release of the remaining 20 living hostages in Gaza, and continued contacts between mediators and both Israel and Hamas, unpacking the politics of what Netanyahu is up to is complex. On the one hand, far right members of his coalition have threatened (once again) to walk away in the event of a ceasefire, demanding the conquest of all of Gaza and Jewish settlement of the coastal strip. On the other is the fact that ceasefire talks are continuing. Earlier this week Hamas said it had accepted a ceasefire proposal that would see the release of some 10 living hostages in the first phase of the a 60 day pause, while senior Israeli officials (but not an official “delegation”) have met with mediators even as Netanyahu has dragged his feet over giving Israel’s reply, reportedly delaying a cabinet meeting where it would have been discussed. All of which leaves big questions unanswered . While some Israeli and international analysts have speculated that the current moves on the ground amount to pressure on Hamas to improve any deal that might just be emerging, others – like Ronen Bergman, one of Israel’s most authoritative security analysts – suggest that Netanyahu would like to push on with fighting for years if possible, in order to delay his ongoing legal cases and ensure his continued political survival. What most agree is that any new major campaign is likely to have serious consequences. For Israelis, including senior figures in the defence establishment, one concern is whether living hostages would survive, an issue motivating the mass demonstrations. Others point out that to all intents and purposes the deal Hamas has agreed to is one Israel signalled its agreement for only weeks ago. Any offensive would be seen by the international community for what it is, the most cynical of moves leading to an even deeper humanitarian catastrophe - if that can even be imagined. Without much military utility, and diplomatically self harming, the suspicion then must be that much of this – for now at least – is deliberately performative, though even veteran Israeli analysts are puzzled to what end. To buy time for Netanyahu to flip flop again about what he sees as the objectives of the war? In the hope that Egyptian pressure on Hamas will provide a deal that can be sold? Or perhaps Netanyahu, like a modern day Macbeth, can no longer see a way forward or a way back, “in blood stepped in so far that should I wade no more returning were as tedious as go o’er.” In Gaza City, thousands of Palestinians have left their homes as Israeli forces have escalated shelling on the Sabra and Tuffah neighbourhoods. Some families have left for shelters along the coast, while others have moved to central and southern parts of the enclave, according to residents there. “We are facing a bitter-bitter situation, to die at home or leave and die somewhere else, as long as this war continues, survival is uncertain,” said Rabah Abu Elias, 67, a father of seven. “In the news, they speak about a possible truce, on the ground, we only hear explosions and see deaths. To leave Gaza City or not isn’t an easy decision to make,” he told Reuters by phone. Israeli tanks have been edging closer to densely populated Gaza City over the past ten days. Israeli officials have said evacuation notices would be issued to Palestinians there before the military moves in. Two more people have died of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the territory’s health ministry said on Thursday. The new deaths raised the number of Palestinians who have died from such causes to 271, including 112 children, since the war began. Iran was seeking to reassert an image of strength on Thursday after suffering heavy losses, when Israel largely destroyed Iran’s air defences during the war and much of its stockpile of ballistic weapons is believed to have been damaged by Israeli strikes. The Iranian Defence Ministry said in a statement on Thursday: “Any new adventure by the enemy will be faced with a strong slap.” Navy units of Iran’s regular armed forces fired missiles and drones at open water targets in the Indian Ocean under the “Sustainable Power 1404” drill, state television reported. “These drills take place around a month after the Iran-Russia drill under the name Casarex 2025 which took place in Iran’s northern waters (Caspian Sea). The Sustainable Power drills...are in Iran’s southern waters,” state TV said. Iranian state television report said the nation’s first millitary exercise since the 12-day war with Israel involved a frigate IRIS Sabalan and a smaller vessel, the IRIS Ganaveh, which launched Nasir and Qadir cruise missiles at targets in the sea, striking them. Coastal batteries also opened fire as part of the exercise. Benjamin Netanyahu has ignored pleas from Australian Jewish groups to calm his feud with Anthony Albanese, further criticising the prime minister and escalating an ugly spat between the two leaders. Australia’s peak Jewish group, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), on Wednesday labelled Israeli prime minister Netanyahu’s attack on Albanese as “inflammatory and provocative”, and a “clumsy intervention” which had affected Australia’s Jewish community. ECAJ’s president, Daniel Aghion, wrote letters to both leaders, critical of the conduct of Albanese and Netanyahu and urging a resolution “in the usual way through diplomacy rather than public posturing”. The group’s co-executive, Alex Ryvchin, had additionally called for “both governments to remember what’s at stake to ensure that calm heads prevail and to conduct their matters of state privately, diplomatically”. But in a new interview with Sky News, Netanyahu again labelled Albanese “weak”. Read the full story here: Israel hammered Gaza City and its outskirts overnight, residents said Thursday, after the defence ministry approved an expanded offensive to target the remaining Hamas strongholds in the strip. The newly approved plan authorises the call-up of roughly 60,000 reservists, deepening fears the campaign will worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory. “We are not waiting. We have begun the preliminary actions, and already now, IDF (army) troops are holding the outskirts of Gaza City,” the Israeli military said in a statement. Israel’s plans to expand the fighting and take control of Gaza City have sparked international outcry as well as domestic opposition. Ahead of the offensive, the Israeli military said the call-up of the reservists would begin in early September. Gaza City residents described relentless bombardments overnight. “The house shakes with us all night long - the sound of explosions, artillery, warplanes, ambulances, and cries for help is killing us,” one of them, Ahmad al-Shanti, told AFP. “The sound is getting closer, but where would we go?”. Iran publicly hanged a convicted murderer at the scene of his alleged crime on Thursday, the judiciary said, just two days after another public execution. Most executions in Iran are carried out inside prisons. Public executions are generally reserved for offences that caused particular outrage. The latest hanging was carried out at dawn in the city of Kordkuy “at the scene of the crime and in public”, provincial judiciary chief Heidar Asiabi told the judiciary’s Mizan Online news website. The condemned man had been convicted of killing “a couple and a young woman with a hunting rifle” late last year, Mizan reported. Nine students in Gaza with full scholarships to study at British universities have been told the UK government is working to facilitate their evacuation. The students – who have all been awarded Chevening scholarships, funded by the Foreign Office in recognition of their potential as future leaders – welcomed the development on Wednesday, but dozens more Palestinians in Gaza with university places are still awaiting news. The breakthrough follows months of advocacy and campaigning by more than 100 MPs, university leaders and other civil society organisations. More than 80 Palestinian students in total have offers at UK universities, including 40 who have secured full scholarships. Dr Nora Parr, a researcher at the University of Birmingham who has been coordinating efforts to support the students, said: “We received news of the government plans with mixed emotions. On the one hand, relief that indeed there is a shared sense of the importance and urgency of the students’ situation – and on the other our hearts sank. What about the rest? We must believe that this is only a start.” Read the full report here: Iran launched its first military exercise since the end of its 12-day war with Israel, state television reported on Thursday, with navy vessels launching missiles at targets at sea in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. While such drills are routine in the Islamic Republic, the “Sustainable Power 1404” exercise comes as authorities in Iran are trying to project strength in the wake of a war that saw Israel destroy air defence systems and bomb nuclear facilities and other sites. The state TV report said naval vessels would fire cruise missiles at targets and use drones over the open water. It did not immediately air any footage from the exercise. Iran’s navy, estimated to have 18,000 personnel, apparently avoided any major attack during the June war. The navy, based out of the port city of Bandar Abbas, patrols the Gulf of Oman, the Indian Ocean and the Caspian Sea, and broadly leaves the Persian Gulf and its narrow mouth, the strait of Hormuz, to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Here are some of the latest images from Gaza: A group of 17 US Senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday calling for the United States to press Israel to grant access and protection to journalists in Gaza. The letter comes one week after an Israeli strike killed a group of Palestinian journalists in the besieged territory. “The United States must make it clear to Israel that banning and censoring media organizations and targeting or threatening members of the press is unacceptable and must stop,” the Democratic senators said in a statement. The letter to Rubio, a staunch supporter of Israel, said: “We urge you to press the Israeli government to protect journalists in Gaza and allow international media to access the territory.” Last week, an Israeli strike killed four journalists for Al Jazeera, including Qatari television correspondent Anas al-Sharif, as well as two freelance journalists. Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war and wider Middle East crisis. The Israeli military has announced the first steps of an operation to take over Gaza City and said it was calling up an extra 60,000 reservists for the offensive. It came as the government considered a new ceasefire proposal that Hamas has agreed on to pause the war and, separately, Israel approved a huge new illegal settlement in the West Bank. Military spokesperson Effie Defrin said on Wednesday the Israel Defense Forces had “begun the preliminary operations and the first stages of the attack on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding the outskirts of Gaza City”. Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters in Gaza on Wednesday and Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said later that the prime minister had sped up the timeline for taking control of Hamas strongholds and defeating the militant group. UN secretary general António Guterres on Thursday called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, saying it was necessary “to avoid the death and destruction that a military operation against Gaza City would inevitably cause”. In other key developments: Israeli defence minister Israel Katz’s order to send more troops into Gaza City came despite international criticism of the offensive, with fears of significant casualties and more mass displacement amid widening conditions of starvation in the territory. The situation in Gaza City was “catastrophic” and “large numbers” were fleeing eastern neighbourhoods, according to the Gaza municipality’s emergency committee chief, Mustafa Qazzaat. Resident Anis Daloul, 64, told the AFP news agency the Israeli military had “destroyed most of the buildings in Zeitoun and displaced thousands of people”. The additional Israeli reserve soldiers would not report for duty until September, a military official said on Wednesday, giving mediators time to bridge gaps between Hamas and Israel over the terms of any ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas said Israel’s plans to conquer Gaza City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts to broker a truce. The Israeli talk of a large-scale operation could primarily be intended to put pressure on the militant group in ceasefire talks, reports Peter Beaumont. More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli war in Gaza since Hamas’s deadly attacks in October 2023, according to Gaza health officials. British UK foreign secretary David Lammy condemned Israel’s approval of the new settlement block in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international law”. The plan would split the West Bank into two with the intention – Israeli far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich has said – of ending any prospect of a Palestinian state. The Israeli military said on Thursday it has received a report about a security incident near the settlement of Malachei HaShalom in the West Bank, adding that details were under review.
