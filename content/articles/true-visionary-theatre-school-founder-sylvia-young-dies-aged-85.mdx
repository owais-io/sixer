  Sylvia Young, the stage school founder who helped nurture the careers of Amy
  Winehouse, Dua Lipa and Daniel Kaluuya, has died at the age of 85. Her death
  was confirmed by her daughter Frances Ruffelle on social media. She paid
  tribute to her “visionary” mother whose school was known for producing many of
  the biggest names in British pop culture during the last three decades.
  Ruffelle, whose post was co-signed by her sister Alison, said: “It is with
  great sadness we let you know that our incredible mum Sylvia Young passed away
  peacefully this morning, 30 July 2025. “Our mum was a true visionary. She gave
  young people from all walks of life the chance to pursue their performing arts
  skills to the highest standard. “Her rare ability to recognise raw talent and
  encourage all her students contributed to the richness of today’s theatre and
  music world, even winning herself an Olivier award along the way. She believed
  hard work with a bit of luck brought success and she was an example of that
  herself.” Young, who grew up in London’s East End and was one of nine
  children, founded the Sylvia Young theatre school in 1981 in Drury Lane in
  central London before it moved to Marylebone two years later. The school
  produced a conveyor belt of talent with alumni including actors such as Billie
  Piper, the TV presenter Denise van Outen and Winehouse. Young told the
  Guardian that reading was a refuge for her growing up and she would consume
  dozens of plays, but she was a reluctant performer herself even after joining
  a theatre club. She said: “I used to lose my voice before every production.
  When I think about it, they were sort of panic attacks.” She said she never
  intended to start a school, but it gradually grew out of drama classes she
  would hold for children at her two daughters’ primary school. Young said there
  was no way to tell which children would go on to be successful. “You see the
  ones that should, but it doesn’t always work. It is talent, but it’s also the
  right job at the right time,” she said. “Pure luck.” Ruffelle said in her
  social media post: “Above all, she leaves the memory of an East End girl who
  worked hard to achieve her goals, took hold of life and lived it to the full.”
  The McFly star Tom Fletcher met his wife, the podcaster and presenter Giovanna
  Fletcher, at the school, which they attended from the age of 13. Young was at
  their wedding. In a tribute, Giovanna Fletcher posted on Instagram: “My life
  would not be what it is without Sylvia Young. I remember watching Sylvia on
  Live and Kicking when I was 12 years old, she was talking about her school and
  all the fun they had there. “I phoned up for a brochure and applied for a
  scholarship without telling my mum and dad. I didn’t get the scholarship, but
  I got a place with a ‘deal’ attached because Sylvia wanted me there –
  something I quickly learned the majority of the 140 students had.” She
  continued: “I loved sitting in Sylvia’s office and watching her work. She was
  meticulous, she knew what every child was up to and how to get the best out of
  everyone, she was devoted to helping her kids and I know how much she cared
  for each of us. Sometimes she cared when others didn’t – helping some
  incredible talent flourish in the process.” In a comment on Young’s daughters’
  social media post, the actor Bonnie Langford added: “Such sad news, Sylvia was
  such an inspiring, kind and generous person. “She made a difference to so many
  and will be missed by so many, love to all the family and all those who she
  made feel were her family. Heartfelt condolences to you Frances and Alison and
  to Stephen and all the team.” The radio presenter Tony Blackburn, who was a
  friend of Young, also paid tribute in a post on X. He said: “So sorry to hear
  Sylvia Young has passed away, she founded the Sylvia Young theatre school
  which has been responsible for starting so many careers in TV and theatre. She
  was a very lovely lady who I have had the privilege of knowing for many years.
  She will be sadly missed.” Young was the subject of an episode of This Is Your
  Life in 1998, and received an OBE in 2005 for her service to the arts. She
  married Norman Ruffelle in London in 1961 and is the grandmother of the singer
  Eliza Doolittle. • This article was amended on 6 August 2025. Sylvia Young was
  85 at the time of her death, not 86 as an earlier version said.
