  “Was Dr. Ritter, With His Steel Teeth, Poisoned in Paradise? Was ‘Baroness
  Eloise,’ Known as ‘Crazy Panties,’ Who Ruled the Island With a Gun and Love,
  Murdered by One of Her Love Slaves After She Had Driven the Other to His
  Death? And Why is Frau Ritter Going Back to What She Once Called ‘Hell’s
  Volcano?’ – the Mystery of the Galapagos Island Which Germany Covets, to Be
  Solved At Last?” This florid passage from a tabloid newspaper caught the eye
  of the author Abbott Kahler decades after it was published in 1941. “Basically
  it was the equivalent of a record scratch,” she recalls. “I was thinking: what
  the hell is the story?” The answer revolves around a group of Europeans from
  the 1930s who attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only
  to encounter the human frailties they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail,
  betrayal, disappearances and murder. The enduring mystery of what exactly
  happened is known as “the Galápagos Affair”. Kahler became so obsessed that
  she wrote a book about it called Eden Undone. And she is not alone. Ron
  Howard, the Oscar-winning film director, learned about the story when he saw
  some photos at a museum in the Galápagos. This led him to make Eden, a movie
  starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Sydney Sweeney and Vanessa Kirby released on
  Friday. Kahler understands the Hollywood potential. “I’ve made a career of
  writing about stranger-than-fiction true stories and this is by far the
  strangest one I’ve ever come across,” she adds. “Just aside from the
  incredible cast of characters, it has timeless themes that still resonate
  today.” Indeed, Howard’s film opens with the blunt statement: “Fascism is
  spreading.” Germany between the wars faced mass poverty, social unrest and
  extremism that gave rise to the Nazi party. Some people looked for a way out
  and a new way of living free from societal constraints. The Galápagos Islands
  off the coast of Ecuador, famed for scientist Charles Darwin’s expedition,
  were thought of as the last great unspoiled territory. Floreana, however, is
  not everyone’s idea of paradise. It is arid, rough and rugged and had
  historically served as a stopping point for pirates collecting tortoises for
  food. A German doctor called Friedrich Ritter left his wife and travelled to
  Floreana with a married woman, Dore Strauch. The austere, misanthropic Ritter
  was driven by Nietzschean ideals and a desire to escape civilisation and come
  up with a radical philosophy to save humanity from itself. Ritter was a strict
  vegetarian and extracted all his teeth and replaced them with steel dentures
  before leaving. He showed little sympathy to Strauch, his former patient, who
  was suffering from multiple sclerosis. A visiting US scientific party were
  fascinated by this “modern day Adam and Eve” and effectively publicised their
  lives for the press back home, attracting more utopia-seekers such as Heinz
  Wittmer, a veteran of the first world war, with his second wife Margret and
  young son. Margret was pregnant and gave birth to the first child officially
  born on the island. Tensions between the two families were further exacerbated
  when Eloise Bosquet de Wagner Wehrhorn, an adventuress who called herself the
  Baroness, arrived with her two lovers, Rudolf Lorenz and Robert Phillipson.
  The Baroness’s flamboyant lifestyle, declarations of being “empress of
  Floreana” and plans for a luxury hotel directly clashed with the other
  settlers’ visions. Kahler says: “She shows up on Floreana in 1932 and
  immediately starts making enemies. The first thing she does is go to Heinz and
  Margret Wittmer’s home – they were pretty much the only truly stable people
  there – and wash her feet in their drinking water. That’s strike one. “Then
  she announces that she’s going to turn Floreana into the next Miami: she’s
  going to build a lavish hotel that’s going to cater to millionaires around the
  world. All of these other people who had gone there wanted solitude and to be
  away from civilisation and here she was directly saying that her goal is the
  opposite and she wants as many visitors as possible. She made it very clear
  that she felt the island was hers to do whatever she wanted to do with.” The
  Baroness’s hedonism was jarringly at odds with Ritter’s asceticism. Kahler
  writes how the Baroness wielded a riding crop and pearl-handled revolver,
  staged fights between her lovers and had sex with American tourists. “She
  pretty much seduced anybody she could. One visitor called her hotel, the
  Hacienda Paradiso, a ‘festering sex complex’.” The remote and harsh
  environment of Floreana intensified the inherent tensions. Food scarcity and
  the constant struggle for survival amplified mistrust. The community descended
  into jealousy and animosity. Ritter became increasingly autocratic and the
  Wittmers struggled to survive amid the discord. Kahler observes: “It’s people
  left to their own devices away from the rules of civilisation. What kind of
  rules will they concoct? Or what kind of lawlessness do they concoct?” In
  March 1934 the Baroness and Phillipson mysteriously vanished. While the
  Wittmers claimed they left for Tahiti, no evidence of their departure or
  arrival was ever found, leading to strong suspicions of foul play. Lorenz, now
  isolated and fearful, fled Floreana. His decomposed body was found on a nearby
  deserted island months later, adding another layer to the mystery. Not long
  after, Ritter died from eating spoiled potted meat, despite his professed
  vegetarianism. Rumours circulated that Strauch had poisoned him. Kahler
  comments: “Two people end up missing and two people end up dead. This is why
  it reminded me of the Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None. A bunch
  of people show up on a remote island and not everybody makes it out alive.”
  The lack of definitive proof and conflicting accounts from memoirs by Strauch
  and Wittmer fuelled the mystery. Strauch returned to Germany, where she died
  from complications from multiple sclerosis in 1943. Margret Wittmer remained
  on Floreana until her death in 2000 at the age of 96; her descendants still
  run a small hotel on the island. For Kahler, the Galápagos affair taps into a
  universal human yearning to get off the grid, even if it turned into a grownup
  version of Lord of the Flies. “Everybody is always dreaming of escaping the
  drudgery and stress of their daily lives and going somewhere fresh where
  nobody knows their name and they can leave their problems behind and fashion a
  brand new utopia for themselves. “Of course, plenty of examples in history
  suggest that’s not possible. Wherever you go, there you are – that old adage
  certainly was true of those settlers in this story. Everybody has a different
  idea of what utopia is or might be and, when you get a bunch of people
  together whose visions of utopia clash, what happens? That’s also something
  that we see time and again throughout history. I’m not surprised it attracted
  Hollywood.” The screenplay for Eden was written by Noah Pink, who has
  previously tackled subjects such as the game Tetris’s unlikely journey from
  the Soviet Union to global hit. He was introduced to the story by Howard in
  2019 and became intrigued by the idea of three factions fleeing Europe with
  three very different philosophies. Pink says via Zoom from Toronto, Canada:
  “I’m boiling it down: Dr Ritter, the purpose of life is pain; Baroness, the
  purpose of life is pleasure; and the Wittmers, the purpose of life is family.
  Very simple and when you watch those three philosophies collide, that’s where
  the fun happens.” What does he hope audiences will take away from the film?
  “One is the importance of sticking by your loved ones and, whether that’s
  chosen family or family, especially in these times when things are seemingly
  very dark around us, we need to stick together and stick to our community and
  help each other out. “It’s also that running away is not the answer because
  you cannot run away from yourself. If we want to fix things, we have to stay
  and we have to fix things.” The intrigue of Floreana also inspired a 2013
  documentary, The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden, directed by Dan Geller
  and Dayna Goldfine. Goldfine says they were particularly drawn to the “vibrant
  characters” and the “underlying theme of trying to escape oneself and escape
  civilisation only to bring your own baggage with you”. She continues: “It was
  that perennial humanity’s thirst for paradise and the philosophical issues
  around it, this notion of what if you actually do follow through on the dream
  to go off into the sunset and on whatever some paradise island and you get
  there and other people arrive with their own different notions of paradise.”
  Eden is out in US cinemas now and in the UK and Australia soon
