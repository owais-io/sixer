  The White House has chosen a top aide to health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr
  to temporarily lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – an
  appointment that is expected to bolster Kennedy’s goals of remaking federal
  vaccine policy. Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and speechwriter for the
  health department during the George W Bush administration, was tapped as
  acting director of the agency that oversees vaccine recommendations, a White
  House official confirmed to the Guardian. O’Neill’s appointment follows the
  firing of infectious disease expert Susan Monarez as the CDC director, after
  she refused to resign under pressure from Kennedy and his allies in what her
  lawyers have called a “targeted” retaliation for refusing to support
  unscientific directives. Her firing has prompted turmoil within the US’s top
  public health agency, and at least three top officials have also quit in
  protest. The agency has been paralyzed in recent weeks, with staff still
  reeling from mass layoffs and a shooting this month at the agency headquarters
  that killed a police officer. Meanwhile, Kennedy – a prominent anti-vaccine
  advocate for two decades – had fired top agency leaders and recently
  reconstituted an expert panel on immunizations. Monarez, who was confirmed by
  the Senate as CDC director less than a month ago, was viewed by agency staff
  and outside experts as someone who could potentially help moderate Kennedy’s
  anti-vaccine agenda. O’Neill, unlike Monarez, has no training in medicine or
  infectious disease science. He is a former speechwriter for the health
  department, during the Bush years, who went on to work for the tech investor
  and conservative megadonor Peter Thiel. During the Covid pandemic, O’Neill
  voiced public support for unproven treatments that were not supported by
  scientific evidence, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, as well as
  vitamin D as a supposed “prophylaxis”. He also posted a number of
  conspiratorial theories on social media, including the baseless claim that
  “the name #COVID was chosen to conceal the origin of the virus. This name made
  it harder to study and probably slowed the response.” In the coming weeks, the
  CDC is scheduled to hold a meeting of its vaccine advisers and O’Neill is
  expected to play a key role. The process could lead to new, restrictive
  guidelines on which Americans will be allowed to receive updated Covid
  vaccines. Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate’s health,
  education, labor and pensions committee, called for the vaccine advisory panel
  to “indefinitely postpone” its scheduled September meeting, amid the chaos at
  the CDC. “If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected
  as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current
  turmoil in CDC leadership,” Cassidy said in a statement. O’Neill can only
  serve as an interim leader of the agency until a permanent director is
  confirmed by the Senate. During confirmation hearings for his current post as
  deputy secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, O’Neill
  insisted he was “pro-vaccine”, but Democrats in the hearings voiced
  skepticism, given O’Neill’s close allyship with Kennedy. News of O’Neill’s
  appointment has sparked criticism among healthcare professionals. Atul
  Gawande, a surgeon, author and public health expert asked: “Has America run
  out of actual health practitioners with demonstrated experience improving
  public health outcomes?” “Or maybe,” he added, “it is just ones willing to
  betray the tenets and beneficiaries of public health that Trump and RFK Jr
  want them to do.” Lauren Gambino contributed reporting
