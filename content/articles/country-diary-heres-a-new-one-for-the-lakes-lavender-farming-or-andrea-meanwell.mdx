  When we think of farming in the Lake District we usually think of the upland
  beef and sheep farms, but there is a wealth of other farming activities going
  on. The Lyth Valley in the south Lakes is famous for its damson trees that
  seem to hover like mist when they are in blossom. These ghostly congregations
  of twisted orchard trees sit amid wide hedgerows and woodland strips between
  the limestone escarpments of Whitbarrow Scar and Brigsteer. The climate here
  is perfect for them. Eighteen farms in the valley have orchards and sell their
  damsons collectively to a supermarket chain as part of the Westmorland Damson
  Association. One of those is Sandi Friend, a member of our Ladies With
  Livestock group, and we have come to visit her today on her former dairy farm,
  bought in 2020 (small fruit farms were hit hard by the advent of imported
  fruit in the 1970s and many turned to dairy). Sandi has an ambitious plan to
  restore the soils and grasslands, rejuvenate the hedgerows, bring the damson
  orchards back into production by pruning and replacing trees – and add an
  entirely new dimension to the business. That new dimension is commercial
  lavender growing – Lake District Lavender. We put on our sunhats and follow
  Sandi over a stile into a field that has strips of lavender growing. We are
  here to help with the harvesting. We’re taught how to cut the bunches with a
  hand scythe, then sit down between the rows cutting away, filling a big
  cardboard box with the goods. Below us is a panorama of the valley. A
  neighbour is cutting grass to make hay and insects hover around us. The number
  of bees and butterflies on the lavender is breathtaking. Although we are busy
  working, it is a new, novel busyness and totally relaxing, away from the cares
  of our own families and farms. We chat about the government closing the
  farming capital grant scheme – Sandi had hoped to apply for group visits to
  the lavender farm, but the scheme closed early. We have one more job to do
  before a scone with jam: pick damsons on the way back to the farmhouse. •
