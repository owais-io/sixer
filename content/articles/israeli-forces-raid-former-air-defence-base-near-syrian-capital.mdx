  Israeli forces raided a former air-defence base in southern Syria on Wednesday
  during a series of airstrikes in the area – their farthermost such operation
  inside Syria since Bashar al-Assad was ousted last December. The airbase, near
  the city of al-Kiswah, about 6 miles (10km) south of Damascus, was previously
  a strategic base for Iranian militias during Assad’s rule. Syrian state media
  reported that the Israeli military had carried out strikes in the same area a
  day earlier, killing six Syrian troops who had found Israeli listening and
  spying devices there. The troops were in the process of dismantling the
  devices when they were killed, state media said. Israeli warplanes and drones
  prevented Syrian forces from entering the area until late on Wednesday night,
  after Israeli forces had left the site. A Syrian military source told Al
  Jazeera that dozens of Israeli troops travelled to the site in four
  helicopters and spent more than two hours there, though it is unclear what
  exactly they did. The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, posted on X that
  forces were “operating in all combat zones day and night for the security of
  Israel”, but otherwise offered no explanation. The Syrian foreign ministry
  condemned the strikes, calling them a violation of international law and a
  breach of the country’s sovereignty. Israel carried out dozens of strikes on
  weapons depots and military bases after the ousting of Assad in December last
  year. It also pushed into the UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated the two
  countries and established military bases there. Israel has warned the new
  Syrian government, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former leader of Islamist rebel
  groups, that it will not allow it to deploy forces to southern Syria. Israeli
  strikes on Syria had all but stopped after the US president, Donald Trump,
  warned Israel to “be reasonable” in Syria, until sectarian clashes broke out
  in Druze-majority areas in southern Syria in June. Israel struck the ministry
  of defence in Damascus and bombed Syrian troops in what it said was an effort
  to protect Syria’s Druze population. Wednesday’s bombings came despite the
  high-level security talks taking place between Syrian and Israeli officials.
  Officials from both countries met in Paris, alongside the US special envoy for
  Syria, Tom Barrack, earlier this month. The Paris talks, in addition to
  meetings in Azerbaijan, are aimed at establishing a security agreement between
  the two countries that would stop Israeli aggression in Syria and provide
  security assurances to Israel. Israel has also requested that the rights of
  the Druze in Syria be respected. Israeli leaders have repeatedly referred to
  the new government in Damascus as “jihadist” and have expressed concerns that
  it could pose a threat to Israelis living close to their shared border. The
  new government in Syria has not attacked Israel and said it wanted regional
  peace, including with Israel. Syria and Israel have technically been at war
  since 1948 and do not have diplomatic relations. In 1974, the two countries
  signed a UN agreement that created a buffer zone between them. Israel said
  that it considered the 1974 agreement as void once Assad had been toppled, and
  pushed past the buffer zone. Syrian officials have said they want to use the
  1974 agreement as a starting point in negotiations between the two countries.
  The US, which is mediating talks between Syria and Israel, has said it hopes
  the two countries could in time normalise relations and join the Abraham
  accords. Syrian officials have said this is a possibility, but emphasised that
  current talks are solely focused on security issues. Barrack has cautioned
  that reaching a security agreement will take time, saying in an interview with
  the US news website Axios that the two countries “have mutual intent and
  desire but at the moment, there is still more work to do”.
