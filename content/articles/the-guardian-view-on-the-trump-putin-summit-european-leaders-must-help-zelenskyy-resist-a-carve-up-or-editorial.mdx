  Zelenskyy resist a carve-up | Editorial

  In recent weeks, as Russia continued its assault on Ukraine in frank disregard
  of White House deadlines and demands, there was hope in Kyiv and European
  capitals that the scales might finally be falling from Donald Trump’s eyes.
  Last month, Mr Trump noted that although his conversations with Vladimir Putin
  repeatedly led him to believe that a ceasefire deal was in reach, the Russian
  president then routinely went on to “knock down a building in Kyiv”. More
  bluntly, he has accused Mr Putin of stringing him along with “bullshit”. It
  was ostensibly on those grounds that the US president set an 8 August deadline
  for Mr Putin to agree to a peace deal with Ukraine, on pain of “significant”
  sanctions. Yet instead of being punished for ignoring this injunction too, Mr
  Putin has been rewarded with a summit with Mr Trump in the United States, and
  apparently allowed to veto any suggestion that Volodymyr Zelenskyy should also
  attend. Suddenly, and alarmingly, it feels a little like February again, when
  Mr Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, treated Mr Zelenskyy with
  outrageous disrespect in the White House, and appeared disposed to pursuing a
  peace agreement on Mr Putin’s terms. There are conflicting accounts of
  discussions between Mr Putin and the US presidential envoy, Steve Witkoff,
  last week. But there is no evidence that Mr Putin has any intention of
  compromising on his maximalist goals in Ukraine, including the annexation of
  eastern regions, demilitarisation and the abandoning of Ukraine’s aspiration
  to Nato membership. Morally and practically speaking, the Ukrainian
  president’s absence on Friday will mean that any “deal” struck by Mr Trump and
  Mr Putin in Alaska lacks all legitimacy. But Kyiv understandably fears a
  carve-up in which Ukraine is pressured by Washington and Moscow to
  unilaterally surrender land in its east, and make other concessions, in
  exchange for a pause in the fighting. This would be, of course, to reward Mr
  Putin’s illegal invasion and betray a nation whose fate is tied up with
  Europe’s security as a whole. The very fact of Friday’s summit, from which
  European leaders are also excluded, is already a wholly unearned diplomatic
  win for Mr Putin. Mr Trump is driven by mercantilism and ego: he may be
  persuaded that if Ukraine could be bullied into accepting the unacceptable,
  opportunities relating to Russian oil and gas could be unleashed, and the
  Nobel peace prize he covets become a genuine possibility. After frantic
  mediation, it emerged on Monday that Mr Zelenskyy and European leaders may
  take part in a joint call with Mr Trump on Wednesday. The Ukrainian president
  has already made it clear that there will be no concession of further
  territory to Russia’s occupying forces. In the lead-up to Alaska, and
  afterwards, Europe must ensure that his words are lent weight by a unified and
  robust stance on what would constitute a just peace, as opposed to one imposed
  against Ukraine’s will. Ultimately, that will need to include credible
  security guarantees for Kyiv from Europe and the US, and an agreed sanctions
  regime to be enacted should Russia renege on its commitments. But the first
  priority must be pressuring Mr Putin to agree to a ceasefire immediately in
  order that meaningful negotiations can begin. Until last week, that appeared
  to be the approach Mr Trump had decided to adopt. It was the right one. Do you
