  The Guardian view on asylum myths: when truth loses, scapegoating takes over
  Britain’s migrant debate | Editorial

  In politics, numbers rarely speak for themselves. They must be framed and
  interpreted. They are often weaponised. In Britain’s increasingly toxic debate
  over asylum and migration, the question isn’t just how many asylum seekers
  arrive on small boats. It’s what those numbers are made to represent – and why
  polls suggest a large proportion of the public now believes things that are
  simply untrue. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has staked her political
  credibility on restoring a sense of grip over the asylum system: reducing the
  backlog by processing cases, accelerating returns of those with no legal claim
  to stay and launching an as yet small-scale “one in, one out” returns deal
  with France. In balancing operational realism with symbolic reassurance, Ms
  Cooper walks a knife-edge between policy and perception. The small boats issue
  is no longer just about shortcomings. It is a cultural firestorm – and one
  increasingly fuelled not by facts, but by misinformation. According to new
  YouGov polling, nearly half of Britons wrongly believe that illegal migrants
  now outnumber those here legally. A staggering 72% of those who support mass
  deportations hold this belief – even though official estimates show legal
  migration outnumbers irregular migration by at least 10 to 1. That gap between
  belief and reality is not accidental. It is the outcome of years of distortion
  by populist media and politicians who conflate asylum, illegality and
  criminality. Figures like Nigel Farage and Robert Jenrick have led the charge,
  using cherrypicked statistics and lurid anecdote to foster the sense of a
  country under siege. Hotels housing asylum seekers have become flashpoints for
  far-right protest. Last summer’s riots, frighteningly, appear to be no fluke.
  They look like a trial run. Ms Cooper’s strategy to confront this with better
  data and a functioning system is, on paper, entirely rational. She wants to
  reassert the difference between political theatre and policy. But data alone
  cannot win a cultural war. Publishing the nationality or immigration status of
  offenders, even in the name of transparency, may serve only to reinforce the
  belief that “foreignness” explains criminality – particularly when the
  dominant public narrative is already so skewed. Amnesty’s warning that
  disclosing suspects’ ethnicity risks becoming a “lightning rod” for racist
  sentiment is well grounded. Moderate former Tory ministers have rightly urged
  caution, calling for accurate data and cooler heads. The former
  counter-terrorism chief Neil Basu is right to compare Faragism to Trumpism:
  both rely on lies about migrants that outpace the truth to win votes. The real
  problem isn’t the number of small boats, but the growing number of Britons who
  see all migration as a threat to identity and safety. YouGov finds that a
  significant proportion of the public now supports not just border control, but
  mass removals of migrants who have already settled here. That is a policy with
  no precedent in mainstream politics since 1971. Worryingly, it is now
  slithering back into public debate. Labour inherited a broken asylum system.
  But it also inherited a poisoned political environment. The risk is that by
  trying to neutralise extremism with incremental reform and datasets, it lends
  legitimacy to the deeper narrative: that the migrant is, at root, the problem.
  Britain is playing with fire, not just because its systems are failing, but
  because the public’s trust in those systems has been methodically eroded. That
  is harder to repair. And far more dangerous to ignore. Do you have an opinion
  on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response
