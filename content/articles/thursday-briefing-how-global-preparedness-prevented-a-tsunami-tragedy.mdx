  Good morning. Yesterday one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded hit
  a sparsely populated region in far east Russia. It triggered a tsunami that
  started crossing the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour. What followed was a
  race against time – early warning systems went into alert mode as waves fanned
  out towards the coastlines of Japan, Hawaii and the US west coast. The damage
  appears to have been minor so far and this is (in part) thanks to a global and
  highly successful disaster response effort. More than three million people
  were successfully warned to evacuate their homes. At the centre of this
  remarkable response was the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) based in
  Hawaii; founded in 1949, by the 1960s it was monitoring tsunamis across the
  entire ocean. A small team of experts identified the size and depth of the
  earthquake, and a tsunami warning was triggered straight away. The whole thing
  worked like clockwork – their speed and accuracy may have saved thousands of
  lives, with temporary evacuees now allowed to return home. But this type of
  work could be under threat. The PTWC is part of a US government agency that
  has faced cuts from Trump’s government. To understand why the response was so
  effective, and why funding such warning systems is so valuable, I spoke to
  Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London.
  That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Travel | The head of the UK’s air
  traffic control company is facing calls to resign after hundreds of flights
  were delayed when the system went down for about 20 minutes on Wednesday.
  Israel-Gaza war | A British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas for
  more than 15 months has accused Keir Starmer of “moral failure” after he set
  the UK on course to recognise a Palestinian state. Emily Damari, 29, who was
  released in January, said the prime minister was “not standing on the right
  side of history” and should be ashamed. UK news | The co-founder of Palestine
  Action can bring a legal challenge to the home secretary’s decision to ban the
  direct action group under anti-terrorism laws, a high court judge has ruled.
  Environment | Ethnic minorities and people living in the most deprived areas
  of England are at increased risk of dying due to excess heat, according to new
  research. Technology | Five million extra online age checks a day are being
  carried out in the UK since the Online Safety Act introduced age-gating for
  pornography sites, according to new data from the Age Verification Providers
  Association. In depth: ‘Lives were saved by drawing on past experience’ The
  8.8-magnitude earthquake hit off Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula early yesterday
  morning. The rupture happened along hundreds of kilometres of a fault line
  where the Pacific plate is sinking below the North American plate. This is one
  of the largest faults on earth (it’s called a megathrust fault) and parts of
  it are underwater, which means there is always a tsunami risk. The earthquake
  was 47 kilometres (30 miles) beneath sea level and sent shock waves at a range
  of 300 kilometres (200 miles). Tsunamis travel across the ocean at about
  500mph, the speed of a jumbo jet, so some communities had a just few minutes
  warning, while those on the other side of the ocean had a few hours. Unlike in
  the movies, when it’s typically one massive wave, tsunamis are often several
  waves which will continue to travel around the world for days. *** What has
  the damage been and where? The epicentre was near the Russian city of
  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000 people. Residents
  fled inland as ports flooded, while 200 miles north the Klyuchevskoy volcano
  (above) erupted, with lava descending its western slope. Maximum tsunami wave
  heights of 4 metres (13ft) were observed in Kamchatka. Some buildings on the
  coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk in Russia were swept away, according to local
  officials. The Kremlin has said alert systems “worked well” in the earthquake
  response and there were “no casualties”. The tsunami prompted warnings and
  evacuations across the Pacific, including in Japan, US west coast, Hawaii,
  Canada, Chile, Ecuador and New Zealand. However, the height of the waves
  turned out to be lower than initially feared. In Hawaii the highest recorded
  waves reached 1.8 metres (6ft), in California there were surges of just over a
  metre (3.6ft), and in Japan waves remained under half a metre. *** How good
  was the warning system? Local authorities were clear about how to evacuate and
  gave specific locations across more than a dozen nations. In Hawaii, for
  example, tsunami warning sirens blared. Evacuations were ordered for some
  coastal areas as the Honolulu department of emergency management warned: “Take
  Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected.” People received alerts on their
  phones. All islands activated emergency operating centres, shelters opened,
  and people in coastal areas were told to go to higher ground. Similar warnings
  were issued elsewhere. In Japan, almost two million people had been ordered to
  higher ground. Local media reported one fatality of a woman killed while
  driving her car off a cliff as she tried to escape. In Chile, authorities
  conducted what the interior ministry said was “perhaps the most massive
  evacuation ever carried out in our country” involving 1.4 million. “It looks
  like it’s been very effective. People had that long-term education, and that
  long-term readiness to know what to do,” says Kelman, estimating that this
  preparedness saved thousands of lives. At this time of year there is a lot of
  tourist activity along many Pacific coastlines, and visitors are often
  unfamiliar with local warning systems or evacuation zones. This can make
  evacuations more challenging. “It appears from places where the tsunami wave
  has hit, numerous lives were saved by drawing on that past experience,” says
  Kelman, notably the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which killed more than 200,000
  people. At the time there was no regional tsunami early warning system in
  place, and the Indian ocean was not considered a high-risk area. Some warnings
  were sent by fax and email, and didn’t reach people in time. The 2004 tsunami
  was also significantly more severe – some waves exceeded 30 metres in height,
  whereas so far waves from this latest tsunami appear to have reached a maximum
  of five metres in Russia, says Kelman. In most places waves were less than a
  metre high, and in many places impacts were negligible so the disaster that
  was anticipated didn’t arrive. This is another important factor in why damage
  has been limited. *** What improvements can be made? Several international
  centres send out automatic messages for earthquakes, depending on the
  location. The Indian Ocean tsunami warning system was set up after 2004. “It
  was never done before then because it was always too expensive, there were
  always other priorities, but suddenly it became a priority … It has been
  tested several times with mixed results, so we have to improve it,” says
  Kelman. There is no effective equivalent for the Atlantic Ocean. The key one
  that identified this earthquake was the PTWC. “They were on it right away,”
  says Kelman. “Knowing the size of the earthquake and the depth of the
  earthquake and the type of the earthquake meant that there was a significant
  chance of a major tsunami. They issued tsunami warnings and got the messages
  out there, which were then disseminated by national governments and local
  authorities.” However, the PTWC sits within a US government agency targeted by
  Elon Musk-led cuts earlier this year. Kelman says this tsunami showed how
  needed they are. “We would hope that if the cuts did affect them, they will be
  reversed and that the people who have saved lives today will also get more
  support for appropriate resources,” he says. “It appears that they were
  nonetheless exceptionally effective, and we owe them so many thanks for
  issuing appropriate messages and saving many lives.” What else we’ve been

  festival, often called the “Black Sundance,” returns for its 14th year. This
  year’s lineup features more than 90 films, from shorts to features, exploring
  themes of legacy, labour, economics and the power of community. Over 15,000
  people attended last year, drawn to its boundary-pushing films and its focus
  on solidarity among Black, brown and Indigenous creators. The festival also
  stands out for its inclusivity: offering childcare for film-makers, ASL
  interpreters at events and audio descriptions for some screenings. Eight
  independent film-makers will also pitch new projects to a panel of executives,
  funders and producers, competing for $75,000 in production support and
  mentorship from Multitude Films. Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The
