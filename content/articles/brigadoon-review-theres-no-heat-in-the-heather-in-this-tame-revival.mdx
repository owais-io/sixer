  Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe’s postwar musical might seem like an
  incredulous romance but it holds great potential for updating in its central
  concept. An off-grid Scottish town called Brigadoon is untouched by time and
  magically returns for one day every hundred years. No one can leave or else
  the town disappears forever. When two Americans, Jeff (Cavan Clarke) and Tommy
  (Louis Gaunt), unknowingly stumble across it and the latter falls in love with
  Fiona (Danielle Fiamanya on press night), it is all set for a love story with
  a Shyamalan-like twist (The Village with bagpipes?). Rona Munro’s adaptation
  does not make enough of this potential, although there is initial promise. The
  American interlopers are not the hunters of the original story but second
  world war pilots who have crashed in the Highlands. Tommy is injured, Jeff
  mentally scarred by war – or so it is intimated. But this goes nowhere beyond
  a few passing comments (“Wars happen and people get lost inside them,” says
  Fiona). Instead this too tame, too purposeless revival seems simply to be a
  love letter to Scotland with bagpipes and drumming galore. Granted, that is
  part of atmosphere-building but there is little of substance beneath it. So it
  swims in its own aspic rather like Brigadoon itself. Directed by Drew McOnie,
  the story seems missing for so long, with song after soupy song. Characters
  are either barely or bluntly defined, from Fiona to her sister Jean (Jasmine
  Jules Andrews), who is getting married, and the wench-like Meg (Nic Myers) who
  tries to woo Jeff. Tommy and Jeff are chirpy but characterless. The cast is
  filled with strong singers, albeit approximate Scottish accents, but the songs
  sound anodyne and generic, from I’ll Go Home With Bonnie Jean to The Heather
  on the Hill. Performers run on and off stage, place heather on it and remove
  it again. McOnie’s choreography is beautiful and balletic in itself, like a
  love letter to the 1954 Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse film and so is Basia
  Bińkowska’s tiered wooden set. There is a twirling romance to Almost Like
  Being in Love and an expressive dance by Maggie (Chrissy Brooke) as she mourns
  the death of villager Harry (Danny Nattrass). But prolonged movement either
  swallows up the story or stands in for it. There is the potential for complex
  characterisation in Harry, who fulminates on Jean’s wedding day before
  declaring he is leaving Brigadoon – thereby threatening its existence. This
  turns a seemingly happy community into an Ursula Le Guin-style dystopia where
  villagers must put collective happiness above individual fulfilment – rather
  like Le Guin’s characters in Omelas. The chase that follows, to stop him,
  should be chilling but you feel nothing of the tension, or greater moral
  issues, here. So it is song and dance in search of a story. No miracles happen
  here, sadly. At Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, London, until 20 September
