  Closing arguments in the national security trial of Jimmy Lai have been
  postponed so the media mogul and activist can receive medical treatment. Lai,
  77, stands accused of foreign collusion under Hong Kong’s national security
  law. He has been detained since 2020, largely in solitary confinement, on
  convictions related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests, and on remand for the
  national security trial. Lai has pleaded not guilty, denying calling for
  sanctions against China and Hong Kong and saying he never advocated
  separatism. On Friday, the final arguments for the long-running trial were
  expected to begin after having been delayed on Thursday by heavy rains from
  ex-tropical cyclone Podul. However his lawyer, Robert Tang, told the court Lai
  had felt unsteady and experienced heart palpitations. He said Lai didn’t want
  to disturb the court, but believed the episodes were brought on by the fatigue
  of coming to court. Judge Esther Toh said he should speak up if he was
  uncomfortable. “The only concern is the heart, it being the heart,” she said.
  Toh said Lai had not received medication and a heart monitor, as recommended
  by a medical specialist, so the three-judge panel overseeing the jury-free
  trial adjourned the case until Monday. Lai’s lawyers and family have
  previously reported concerns about his deteriorating health while in custody.
  Lai’s national security trial has stretched for more than 140 days, drawing
  condemnation from foreign governments, human rights groups, and international
  legal experts. The Hong Kong government has rejected criticism of its
  prosecution of Lai – and countless other pro-democracy activists. On Wednesday
  it labeled criticism of Lai’s treatment in custody and the trial as
  “slanderous remarks” by external forces and “anti-China media organisations”.
  On Thursday, US president Donald Trump said he was “going to do everything I
  can to save [Lai],” but walked back comments he made prior to his election
  that he could talk to China’s leader, Xi Jinping and “100%, I will get him
  out”. “I said, 100%, I’m going to be bringing it up,” Trump said on Thursday.
