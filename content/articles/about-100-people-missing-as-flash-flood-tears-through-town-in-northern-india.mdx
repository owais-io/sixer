  Dozens of people were missing after a fast-moving surge of water and mud
  smashed into a town in India’s Himalayan region on Tuesday, tearing down a
  mountain valley and demolishing buildings, killing at least five people.
  Videos broadcast on Indian media showed a terrifying river of muddy water
  engulf the town of Dharali in Uttarakhand state on Tuesday afternoon, sweeping
  away entire homes and apartment blocks. In footage recorded at the scene,
  people could been seen screaming in fear as they tried to escape the surging
  flood waters. Dozens in the village had been gathered in a temple for a
  festival as the wave of dark water and debris struck at high velocity. The
  Indian defence minister, Sanjay Seth, confirmed that four people had been
  killed in the disaster but officials feared the number could rise.
  Approximately 100 people were reported missing on Tuesday and scores remained
  unaccounted for and feared trapped in the mud, including about eight soldiers
  who were reported missing from a camp in the area. “The number of missing
  persons is unknown. However, the relief efforts have continued through the
  night,” said the rescue leader, Colonel Harshvardhan, in a post on X on
  Wednesday. “We are trying to rescue people and take them to safety.” The
  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said rescue teams had
  been deployed “on a war footing”. Dhami said the flood was caused by a sudden
  and intense “cloudburst”, calling the destruction “extremely sad and
  distressing”. The India Meteorological Department said it had recorded
  “extremely heavy” rainfall of about 21cm (8in) in some parts of Uttarakhand.
  Overnight rescue efforts were hampered as heavy rain continued to fall and
  access remained challenging, as several key roads had washed away. Rivers
  across Uttarakhand were flowing above the danger mark on Wednesday, leading to
  concerns of further landslides and disasters in the area. The central water
  commission said that four rivers at five sites remained in a “severe flood
  situation”. India’s army said 150 troops had reached the town, helping to
  rescue about 20 people who had survived the wall of freezing sludge. “A
  massive mudslide struck Dharali … triggering a sudden flow of debris and water
  through the settlement,” the army said. Images released by the army, taken
  from the site after the main torrent showed swathes of the town swamped mud
  and deep debris, and a slow moving muddy river still flowing through the town.
  “Search and rescue efforts are ongoing, with all available resources being
  deployed to locate and evacuate any remaining stranded persons,” an army
  spokesperson, Suneel Bartwal, said. The prime minister, Narendra Modi,
  expressed his condolences, and said that “no stone is being left unturned in
  providing assistance”. Deadly floods and landslides are common during the
  monsoon season from June to September, but experts say the climate crisis,
  coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and severity. The
  UN’s World Meteorological Organization said in 2024 that more intense floods
  and droughts are a “distress signal” for what can be expected as climate
  breakdown makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable. Uttarakhand,
  which has mountainous and often unstable terrain, has faced several
  monsoon-related disasters in its recent history. In 2013, flash floods in
  Kedarnath killed 4,127 people and in 2021, a glacier burst triggered an
  avalanche in Chamoli, killing more than 200. Harjeet Singh, a climate activist
  and founding director of Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said the tragedy
  was caused by a “deadly cocktail”. “Global warming is supercharging our
  monsoons with extreme rain, while on the ground, our own policies of cutting
  hills, unscientific, unsustainable and reckless construction, and choking
  rivers for so-called ‘development’ are destroying our natural defences,” he
  said. “Are we not engineering our own disasters?”
