  The Prince Charles cinema is planning to expand to a second site in the
  capital despite being locked in a battle over the future of its original
  location in central London. The independent cinema, which is known for showing
  a wide-ranging selection of cult films from across the history of cinema, has
  put in a bid to take over and reopen what was the Stratford Picturehouse in
  east London. The Prince Charles is in negotiations with Zedwell LSQ Ltd (which
  is owned by the developers Criterion Capital) over the future of the Leicester
  Square site, but wants to expand in what could be the first of several new
  outposts. “Given what’s happened this year, I understand how it could look
  like we’re trying to shift operations but that’s not what’s happening,” said
  Paul Vickery, the cinema’s head of programming. “We were looking for a
  pre-existing venue that needed a bit of love which we could turn into a new
  site. Ideally, we’d want to go on to add a third or fourth space.” The Prince
  Charles had looked previously into taking over the Filmhouse in Edinburgh,
  which was forced to close in 2022 before it reopened in June this year after a
  refurbishment. Vickery thinks Stratford – an area that has undergone huge
  regeneration over the past decade, boosted by the Olympic legacy of London
  2012 – could be an ideal place to open a new outpost. “Stratford has always
  been a hub,” he said. “There are plenty of students and loads of new-build
  properties that have sprung up recently. But it also feels like it’s still
  trying to find its feet and figure out what it is.” The Prince Charles Cinema
  East would join other cultural institutions such as Soho Theatre Walthamstow,
  Sadler’s Wells East and the V&amp;A East Storehouse in that part of London,
  while the Theatre Royal Stratford East would be a nearby neighbour. The cinema
  has high-profile international fans, including the directors Paul Thomas
  Anderson, Quentin Tarantino and John Waters. It was opened as a live theatre
  in 1962 and taken over as a repertory cinema in 1991 with cut-price seats.
  When news broke that the cinema could be forced out of its original location
  in Leicester Square, a petition against the move generated 100,000 signatures
  in a single day. Vickery said: “The response was so humbling, I knew we’d have
  a load of interest in helping us out but the volume of support and speed with
  which it spread was a surprise. “You feel the responsibility but in the best
  possible way. You’re not just some pokey cinema in central London, what we do
  means something to people.”
