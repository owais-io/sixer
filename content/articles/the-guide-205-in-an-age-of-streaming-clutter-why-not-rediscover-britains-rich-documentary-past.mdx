  rich documentary past?

  The state of British TV documentary film-making is a little depressing at the
  moment. Open up the documentaries tab on iPlayer, Now, ITVX or Channel 4, and
  you’ll be assaulted by a rush of true crime docs, each with their own
  macabre/salacious title – Satan’s Au Pair, Catching the Frying Pan Killer,
  that sort of thing – and a little rectangular title card with said killer
  looking evil, preferably in a grainy black and white picture with a bloody
  thumbprint overlaid. And it if isn’t true crime you’re greeted with, it will
  be one of the other broadcaster-permitted forms of documentary these days:
  celebrity travelogues; largely unenlightening pop science docs about just how
  bad a certain type of food is for you; shameless corporate tie-ins where
  someone walks round a Haribo factory and gawps in wonder; tightly controlled
  famous-people profiles, where anything vaguely controversial or interesting
  has been sliced out of the final, interviewee-approved cut; or series about
  air fryers (Channel 5, we salute your unwavering commitment to this
  sub-genre). OK I’m being a bit harsh here. There are still plenty of great,
  agenda-setting TV documentaries being made. But it does feel like an extremely
  hard time to be one of those TV documentary-makers, who have to work within
  the strictures of streaming, where series need to slot neatly into
  algorithmically selected genre verticals. You’d imagine many of those
  doc-makers must have read tributes and obituaries to Alan Yentob, when he
  passed away back in May, and felt a pang of jealousy over the freedom of his
  Arena heyday, where there was the potential to go and make documentaries on
  the Ford Cortina, the Chelsea Hotel or anything else, big or small, that
  fascinated you. Lately I’ve been swerving a lot of current docs to instead
  watch older ones unaffected by algorithms and taste clusters. I’ve been really
  enjoying the films of Molly Dineen (pictured above), who seems a little
  overlooked in 2025 but who in the late 80s and 90s was regarded as a bit of
  documentary wunderkind, delivering a series of humane, idiosyncratic films
  about British life. Her breakthrough was in 1987 with Home From the Hill, a
  portrait of an old Empire colonel returning to Britain and having to navigate
  a changed world (and, in one absurd scene, a tin of ravioli). Resembling a
  real-life Rowley Birkin QC sketch from The Fast Show, but sadder and stranger,
  it was picked up by the BBC despite being made while Dineen was still in film
  school. From there she rattled through a run of fascinating films on London
  Zoo, Irish roadwork companies, The House of Lords, and an epic two-hour
  profile of Geri Halliwell as she went from Spice Girl to UN goodwill
  ambassador. You’ll have to stump up for these – they’re available to rent on
  the BFI Player – though one of Dineen’s films is available on streaming, and
  it’s a corker. Heart of the Angel (1989), available on iPlayer, followed the
  “fluffers”, maintenance workers and ticket inspectors at a then-dilapidated
  Angel tube station as they mused on the existence of heaven and hell and
  argued over the cost of a single to Oval. And actually, when you dig past the
  true crime, the iPlayer is a pretty amazing archive for these sorts of
  freewheeling older docs: tucked away in its furthest corners you’ll, find for
  example, Signs of the Times, a collaboration between the Beeb and Martin Parr
  that looks at ideas of good and bad taste in the British home, from mouldering
  country piles to terrace houses, and is full of eccentric figures like the
  bloke who thought it looked more stylish to only fill in the stonework on half
  of the wall behind his mantelpiece. Or old episodes of the archaeology strand
  Chronicle, including a loopy instalment where the show, with help from Olympic
  800m runner Ann Packer, attempts to fact check the erroneous idea that Pliny
  claimed the Romans marched a load of geese from Northern Gaul to Rome. Or
  classic Arena instalments on the aforementioned Chelsea Hotel and pop artist
  Peter Blake’s fascination with Kendo Nagasaki. Or, of course, the hefty
  archive of films by Adam Curtis, from his early series like Pandora’s Box and
  the Living Dead, right up to the shorts he did for Charlie Brooker’s
  Screenwipe. Channel 4, too, is stuffed full of great vintage TV docs: Nick
  Broomfield films on the far-right south African politician Eugène
  Terre’Blanche, Biggie and Tupac, a post-premiership Margaret Thatcher, and the
  media circus around serial killer Aileen ‘Monster’ Wuornos; or Chasing
  Rainbows, one of the first proper TV surveys of British musical culture, from
  the music hall to Bhangra dance nights; or the three parter, White Tribe,
  where the great racial justice campaigner and broadcaster Darcus Howe digs
  into the meaning of white English culture, complete with an encounter with
  Bernard Manning. There are constant reminders of C4’s boundary-pushing, wildly
  experimental past in series like The Trip, an eight-parter that set early Nasa
  footage to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada and Richie Hawtin, or The Ghosts of
  Oxford Street, a completely crackers Malcolm McLaren docu-music film ode to
  London’s retail mecca that featured Tom Jones as the founder of Selfridges and
  the Happy Mondays as hanged highwaymen, and was somehow broadcast on Christmas
  Day. It’s a shame, then, that ITV is so comparatively crap at celebrating its
  own documentary history: The Cook Report, Whicker’s World, South Bank Show,
  Death on the Rock and all. You won’t find any of that on ITVX, though you will
  find The Preppy Murder and Gary Barlow’s Food and Wine Tour: Australia. Still,
  ITV does have every episode of maybe the greatest British documentary
  achievement of them all, the 7Up series following, in seven year intervals, a
  group of British children as they grow up into adults. Despite the death of
  the series’ longtime director Michael Apted in 2021, the series is returning
  next year for 70Up – proof that, for all my grumbling about endless true crime
  docs, a sliver of Britain’s freewheeling documentary past still lives on. If
