  I’m 46 years old and I have been on a diet since I was 11. For as long as I
  can remember, eating has given me comfort. As a kid, I lied to my friends’
  parents so I could eat a second dinner at their house. I’ve never wanted just
  one cookie – I’d eat 12 and only stop when I felt physically ill, and
  sometimes not even then. In nearly every photo of me as a teenager I’m
  wincing, sucking in my stomach, trying to pose. I never really enjoyed the
  taste of these foods, nor was I happy with myself after eating them. They came
  with a side of guilt: you don’t deserve this. This relentless food noise
  trapped me in a cycle of wanting to eat, then shaming myself for doing it. I
  spent inordinate energy hating my too tall, too big body. I always felt
  simultaneously like not enough and too much. Now, GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic,
  Wegovy and Mounjaro are being hyped as an easy fix to obesity. Their
  manufacturers have experienced significant revenue growth credited to the
  drugs’ popularity; for instance, Eli Lilly recently announced 38% yearly
  growth, credited in part to sales of Zepbound and Mounjaro. Media headlines
  tout the changes in weight and appetite for those who take them. But what if
  the “miracle” doesn’t work for you? *** Being diagnosed with diabetes at age
  27 threw me deeper into a shame spiral. At the time, my doctor clinically
  defined me as obese. That, along with the prognosis of a deficient pancreas,
  felt like punishment for decades of failing to control my overeating. Given my
  family history of diabetes – my grandpa had it – the doctor diagnosed me as
  type 2 and recommended dramatic lifestyle adjustments, including carb counting
  and daily exercise. She also did an A1C test, which measures average blood
  sugar levels for three months. A non-diabetic’s result would be under 5.7%.
  Mine was 7.7%. This diagnosis felt like being sentenced to lifelong obsession.
  Food already controlled me, and now it had even more power. Over the next five
  years, I worked with a nutritionist and psychotherapist. I trained for a
  200-mile relay race with friends. I did Weight Watchers, went to Overeaters
  Anonymous, worked the 12-step program, and used apps like Noom and My Fitness
  Pal. I lost 50lb. Still, I remained overweight according to the BMI chart, and
  my A1C didn’t budge, which confounded my primary care doctor. She referred me
  to an endocrinologist who specialized in metabolic health. Six months later,
  when my appointment finally arrived, my A1C had shot up to 9.1%. That should
  not have happened while I shed pounds. She declared I was misdiagnosed: type 2
  diabetics’ bodies make insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar, but don’t
  use it effectively. But I was actually type 1, an autoimmune condition where
  the body stops producing insulin. I would be dependent on insulin injections
  from that point forward. Living with diabetes was taxing. I had to order a
  continuous glucose monitor (CGM), pen needles, insulin vials and other items –
  but via a specialty supplier rather than a standard pharmacy, for insurance
  purposes. I had to procure pre-authorization forms for medication and attend
  required half-day training sessions every time I wanted to try a different
  insulin pump or when my insurance changed. In 2018, after five years of
  effort, my A1C settled in at 5.9% – a happy result for me and my doctor. But
  to get to a weight my doctor would approve, I still had to lose 30lb. She
  started me on a new drug called Ozempic. Like most people at that point, I’d
  never heard of it. She said it was only technically approved for type 2
  patients – but some who were overweight with type 1, like me, were taking it
  to help with weight loss. Over the next four years, my doctor and I gradually
  increased my Ozempic dosage and eventually were pleased with the results: when
  I woke in the morning my fasting blood sugar reading was finally within the
  recommended range of 80-120 on my CGM. I was able to reduce my regular insulin
  usage. But my weight didn’t change. I continued my healthier eating habits and
  exercised regularly with cycling, yoga and running. Still, the scale didn’t
  move. *** In 2022, when Ozempic was becoming a household name, I suddenly had
  two problems. First, my doctor confirmed I was already on the highest
  available dose, so taking more wouldn’t help me lose weight. Second, because
  the drugs were now being more widely used for general weight loss, I might
  have trouble filling my prescription. A global shortage followed, and I went
  four months without, eventually switching to Mounjaro because it was
  available. My already-thin friends started taking GLP-1s, and I couldn’t avoid
  chatter about the “skinny shot”. “I’m not even hungry! I don’t even think
  about food!” they’d say. But I didn’t experience this quieting of the voices
  in my head telling me I was hungry all the time, and I wondered why. I was
  furious. As my friends celebrated their new bodies, I wondered, again, what
  was wrong with mine. My diabetes was under control, but I was also existing at
  the margins of a miracle. An estimated 15% of all GLP-1 users are so-called
  “non-responders” to the weight loss effect, according to Atlanta-based
  physician Dr Cristina Del Toro Badessa. Lucas Veritas, a GLP-1 user from
  Montreal and author of The GLP-1 Effect newsletter, highlighted clinical
  trials showing that approximately 13% of people taking semaglutide (the active
  ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and about 9% of those taking tirzepatide
  (found in Mounjaro and Zepbound) did not lose more than 5% of their body
  weight. “The meds are highly effective for a majority of patients but there is
  still a percentage who don’t lose a clinically significant percentage of body
  weight. Everyone’s physiology is a little different,” said Veronica Johnson
  MD, an obesity medicine specialist in Chicago. Recent research has identified
  a gene that may help predict who will successfully lose weight with GLP-1
  medications. Additionally, according to a recent study comparing GLP-1
  medications to bariatric surgery, “real world” cohorts lost less weight than
  what drug companies reported in their trials: about 5% of their body weight,
  compared with the 15% reported for semaglutide and the 20–25% for tirzepatide
  in pharma-funded studies. Nicoletta LaMarca-Sacco, 56, a former Ozempic user
  in New York, also didn’t lose weight after a year of use. “I’ve always been a
  squishy mom and will continue to be,” she said. “It just didn’t work for me.”
  She expected the drug would quiet more of the internal chatter telling her she
  needed to snack. “It did help, but only to a small degree,” she said. “When we
  consider these drugs, they need to be combined with other markers of good
  health like diet, exercise, even stress management,” said Dr Raj Dasgupta, an
  ABIM Quadruple board-certified physician in Los Angeles. He said his patients
  sometimes had unrealistic expectations about how quickly and dramatically they
  will drop extra pounds. He explained that for someone who is overweight,
  shedding even a small amount of weight can improve heart and kidney function,
  adding: “The bar has been set too high for weight loss.” “What’s dangerous,”
  Badessa said, “is the dominant societal narrative that these are ‘magic shots’
  for weight loss.” Veritas agreed: “Expectations are sky-high. People see all
  the before/after photos and expect an easy ride.” “It feels similar to any
  other time the diet industry has thrown marketing momentum behind one
  particular ‘fix’,” Virginia Sole-Smith, author of Fat Talk, told me about the
  current hype. “There’s excitement that we’ve found a ‘silver bullet’, then it
  silences any other narratives and experiences about it.” I had definitely been
  looking for an elixir to rid me of body mass. Then I discovered that diabetes
  itself might be the reason I wasn’t losing weight. Andrew Koutnik, a metabolic
  research scientist, said that GLP-1s typically lead to significant weight loss
  for people with obesity (15-25% of their body weight). However, people with
  diabetes generally lost less weight, proportionally: for type 2, an average of
  8-11%; for type 1, about 8-12%. “While we don’t know why this is occurring,
  prior data suggests the drug’s metabolic effects may be tied to how well the
  body manages glucose,” Koutnik said. GLP-1s are designed to coax the body into
  making and using insulin more efficiently, he explained. But for someone with
  type 1 diabetes, meaning their pancreas cannot make insulin, that’s like
  installing a turbocharger on a car with no engine – there’s nothing to boost.
  That said, he clarified, these drugs aren’t entirely useless for people with
  type 1. GLP-1s slow digestion and suppress appetite, which can lead to fewer
  snacks and less carb-heavy meals. That might nudge blood sugar in the right
  direction, but it’s more of a side-effect. “The actual impact on blood sugar
  control is minimal: less than a 1% drop in A1C,” Koutnik explained. *** The
  psychological fallout of being a non-responder can be devastating. It was more
  fodder for my destructive inner dialogue: Why won’t my body just comply?
  Alyson Curtis, a therapist based in New York, works with patients who feel
  isolated as they see others losing weight and don’t have the same result. I
  told her how unfair it felt and she agreed the loss of agency can be a lot to
  process. “I hear the ‘thin fantasy’ constantly from patients – it’s a dream to
  fit into societal norms,” Curtis added, “but what they’re really saying is
  they want to be accepted, cherished, adored.” She helps patients reframe
  success to focus on healthy outcomes beyond weight loss – like how the Health
  at Every Size (HAES) movement centers on overall wellbeing. Still, these drugs
  are here to stay. Johnson pointed to recent innovations like CagriSema, a
  compound drug bringing together an amylin agonist and a GLP-1. In trials,
  CagriSema helped reduce blood sugar spikes after meals and can also contribute
  to weight loss. “The hormone called amylin is normally released by the same
  cells that make insulin – which type 1 diabetics lack,” Koutnik said. He added
  that amylin helps slow digestion and also lowers levels of glucagon, which
  could help better manage blood sugar. Society seems to have rewritten ideas
  about health, worth and willpower through the lens of these astonishing drugs.
  I figured I could, too. I’ve tried to quiet the inner voice that’s shaming me
  into thinking I’m a failure for not losing more weight. Forging
  self-acceptance from deep frustration, I am realizing there is nothing
  inherently “wrong” with my body – I am simply among those for whom the current
  medications produce a partial benefit. Learning that I’m not alone has helped
  curb my body shame. I am grateful that GLP-1s have helped me with blood sugar
  control, minimizing my risk of complications from diabetes. “When we focus on
  the miracle weight loss narrative, we ignore their real value in helping
  people with diabetes, adding to the discourse of body shaming, which is never
  health-promoting,” said Sole-Smith. I’ve been trying to shift my focus from
  weight loss to improving my relationship with food. For me, that’s learning to
  eat with more intention and maybe even a little joy. Hopefully, I can come to
  appreciate my right to the occasional indulgence without self-recrimination.
  And on my next birthday, I want to celebrate with the most delicious symbol of
  self-acceptance: a guilt-free piece of cake. • This article was amended on 18
  August 2025 to remove a reference to Ozempic being approved for weight loss;
  it is not authorised for this purpose, although it is sometimes prescribed
  “off-label” as a weight-loss drug.
