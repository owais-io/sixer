  Scotland’s first outdoor skatepark – currently buried beneath rubble in
  Glasgow’s Kelvingrove park – will be excavated next week in an attempt to
  preserve its legacy. Archaeologists at the University of Glasgow are inviting
  volunteers to join them as they begin their excavation and survey work at the
  former Kelvin Wheelies park, which has been underground for more than three
  decades. Incorporating a dual slalom run, half-pipe and bowls, Kelvin Wheelies
  was considered a radical design when it opened in May 1978, hosting the first
  Scottish Skateboard Championships later that year and attracting pro-skaters
  from across the UK. But a dip in popularity, coinciding with concerns about
  maintenance and safety, led to its closure in 1983, and now only a few top
  sections of concrete remain visible at the site, which is overgrown with trees
  and shrubs. Dr Kenny Brophy, a senior lecturer in archaeology at the
  University of Glasgow and project leader, said the excavation, which is in
  partnership with the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, was a unique
  opportunity to explore part of the city’s modern sporting heritage. “Glasgow
  city council spent £100,000 building it, which was a large investment at the
  time and it was designed with skaters in mind, and for teenagers who were
  involved in an activity that many people deemed to be antisocial and
  marginal,” he said. While skateboarding will become a mandatory Olympic sport
  for the first time at the 2028 summer games, having been discretionary in 2020
  and 2024, back then it was “a really important grassroots sport that engaged
  hundreds of young people”. Next week’s field work, using hand tools rather
  than heavy machinery, will dig trenches to expose area of the concrete and
  hopefully some original 80s graffiti. “In the same way as if you were
  excavating a round barrel from the bronze age, you want to extract as much
  information as possible from an achievable area,” Brophy said. Brophy, along
  with students and volunteers from Archaeology Scotland’s New Audiences
  project, will also be digging with former park users. “It’s such a rare
  opportunity for an archeologist that we’ll be digging the site with people
  that used it,” he said. “We’ll have skateboarders on site who used the park as
  teenagers and will be re-living that experience at the end of a trowel.” Jamie
  Blair, owner of Glasgow-based skateboarding shop Clan Skates and a former
  Scottish skateboard champion, will be one of them. “When Kelvin Wheelies
  opened in 1978, skaters from all over the UK flocked to this radical new
  facility. A park team was formed and for the next few years Glasgow was the
  dominant force in Scottish skateboarding,” said Blair. “I’m thrilled that
  through this project we have a chance to rediscover it.”
