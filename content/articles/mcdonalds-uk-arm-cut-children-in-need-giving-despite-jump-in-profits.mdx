  McDonald’s UK arm has cut its donations to some charities despite profits
  soaring more than 80% last year as it shed almost 2,000 jobs, according to its
  latest accounts. Documents newly filed at Companies House for the fast food
  chain’s British business in 2024 show it gave £529,000 to Children in Need –
  reduced from £952,000 the previous year – and handed £744,000 to Ronald
  McDonald House charities, down from £779,000. It reduced the headcount at its
  directly operated business to 24,375 from 26,384 – with all reductions from
  restaurants and operations rather than head office. McDonald’s has more than
  1,400 sites in the UK and Ireland, with a large proportion operated by
  franchisees who employ their own staff – more than 140,000 people. Just over
  half of sales reported by the UK arm came via franchisees. It was not made
  clear in the accounts if some workers who left McDonald’s wholly owned outlets
  were transferred to franchise partners. The UK business said it had paid an
  £83m dividend to its parent group in 2024, up from zero a year before, as
  pre-tax profits rose to £120m despite a slight fall in sales to £1.82bn. The
  details of reduced staffing at McDonald’s come after the group said its high
  street estate “continues to be impacted by challenging retail footfall”. A
  statement from the board included in the accounts said an improvement in
  operating profits had been “predominantly driven by savings in administrative
  expenses”, but that improvement had been slowed “by continued inflationary
  pressures impacting food, paper and utility costs on the company-operated
  estate”. The business, which has been criticised for its heavy use of
  zero-hours contracts, which are to be restricted under new government
  measures, said it offered staff “the choice between guaranteed hours and
  flexible contracts”. After reports of harassment of UK staff on zero-hours
  contracts, McDonald’s said in its accounts it was recruiting a “head of
  safeguarding” and had set up an investigations handling unit to follow up
  claims of abuse. In January, the chief executive of McDonald’s told MPs that
  29 people had been dismissed in the past year after allegations of sexual
  harassment. The UK boss of the fast food chain, Alistair Macrow, said the
  company had been alerted to 75 allegations of sexual harassment over the last
  12 months, 47 of which had been upheld with disciplinary action taken and 29
  of which resulted in people being dismissed. At the time a spokesperson for
  the group said: “Any incident of misconduct and harassment is unacceptable and
  subject to rapid and thorough investigation and action.” McDonald’s UK was
  approached for comment.
