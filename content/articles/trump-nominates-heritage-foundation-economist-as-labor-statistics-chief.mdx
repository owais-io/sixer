  Donald Trump has announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at
  the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau
  of Labor Statistics. “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the
  Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said in a post on Truth
  Social. The nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika
  McEntarfer, earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report
  which he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged”. Antoni, a longtime
  critic of the agency, had previously voiced concerns about revisions to the
  BLS jobs data. “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate
  data – that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent
  delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has
  been lost over the last several years,” Antoni posted on X earlier this month.
  The Senate will have to confirm his nomination to lead the BLS, an independent
  agency under the labor department. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday
  that former White House adviser and rightwing provocateur Steve Bannon had
  advocated for Antoni’s nomination. In a statement on X, labor secretary Lori
  Chavez-DeRemer said Antoni would “provide the American people with fair and
  accurate economic data they can rely on”. The president’s shock firing of
  McEntarfer alarmed economists and statisticians – as well as some senior
  Republican lawmakers –who feared the move would undermine the credibility of
  the agency’s economic data – long seen as a gold standard.
