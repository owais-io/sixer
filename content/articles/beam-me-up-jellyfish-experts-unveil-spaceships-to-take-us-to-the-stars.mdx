  Spaceships modelled on jellyfish, 3D-printed homes, polyamorous relationships
  and vegetarian diets are among the ways in which experts have envisaged making
  interstellar travel feasible. The ideas from scientists, engineers, architects
  and social theorists came in response to a global competition to develop plans
  for “generation ships”, self-sustaining crafts capable of supporting up to
  1,500 people on a 250-year journey to a habitable planet. Entrants to the
  Project Hyperion design competition, launched last year, could only
  incorporate current technologies or those expected to emerge in the near
  future, such as nuclear fusion, into their proposals. An expert panel,
  including Nasa scientists, judged the viability of almost 100 submissions,
  assessing how their habitats, architecture and social structures would allow
  the crew to not only survive but flourish as a society across multiple
  generations of space flight. The winner was Chrysalis, a 58km cigar-shaped
  craft, designed around a series of concentric cylinders, each dedicated to a
  different function: 3D-printed living quarters; communal spaces, including
  parks, libraries and galleries; and farms and biomes of different Earth
  environments, such as tropical forests. As animals would be brought onboard
  only to maintain biodiversity, a vegetarian diet would be necessary. The
  design won praise for its detailed plans, particularly how the psychological
  resilience of the crew would be vetted by living in isolated Antarctic bases.
  The proposal also explained how family structures would change, with
  individuals’ sense of belonging based more on being part of the starship
  community. Inhabitants would be allowed to have children but not necessarily
  with the same partners. The second place design was Hyperion, a spacecraft
  which resembles the space station from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The twin rings
  of this design are engineered to generate an Earth-like magnetic field, which
  would be essential for a successful pregnancy in deep space, without which the
  mission would be doomed. The proposal also includes designs for loose-fitting
  clothes with large sealable pockets to prevent items from falling out in low
  gravity. The mission would include three pairs of turtles, chosen for their
  longevity, relatively inactive, and resistance to disease. The third place
  design, Systema Stellare Proximum, is modelled after the shape of a jellyfish
  and uses a hollowed-out asteroid as a shield against impacts. It envisages a
  society guided by a non-human collective intelligence and human council, as
  well as the potential emergence of new religions, such as neopaganism that
  deifies “nature and man, in all his forms”. Other notable entires included
  Endless Beyond the Stars, which includes floating light created from biogas,
  generated from the bodies of the dead. Dr Andreas Hein, the executive director
  of the Initiative for Interstellar Studies, which ran the competition, said it
  was “part of a larger exercise to explore if humanity can travel to the stars”
  and how “a civilisation might live, learn and evolve in a highly
  resource-constrained environment”. He added: “We asked participants to
  integrate architecture, technology and social systems to conceptualise a
  functional society spanning centuries – and the outcome was beyond
  expectations.”
