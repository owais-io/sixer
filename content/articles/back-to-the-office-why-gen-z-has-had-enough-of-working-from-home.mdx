webTitle: Back to the office! Why gen Z has had enough of working from home

  Name: Office work. Age: The first purpose-built offices appeared in the 18th
  century. Appearance: Cubicle-shaped. Why are we talking about the office? What
  a buzzkill. Because it’s back, baby. Is this about employers forcing people
  back into the office, citing “culture” and “connection”, but mostly wanting to
  check employees aren’t slacking? It’s true that there’s been a push from big
  employers such as Amazon and Tesco over the past year to get people back on
  site, but this is different: in a new Bupa survey of 8,000 workers, 45% of gen
  Z respondents said they were considering looking for jobs with more social
  interaction. Interesting. Why? Because they’re lonely: 38% of them feel
  socially isolated because of their work circumstances; that’s more than other
  generations. “I specifically applied for roles with a physical office where I
  have supportive colleagues, can socialise at lunchtimes and meet friends in
  the evenings,” one gen Z worker explained. I thought they wanted to be TikTok
  content creators not corporate drones? Actually, the influencers were the
  loneliest of all: 45% said their work made them feel lonely and a third were
  considering returning to “full-time, traditional employment” in the next five
  years. Huh. You can tell they have never been in an office if they think it’s
  something to aspire to. Aren’t you excited about this infusion of new young
  blood? They’ll be a breath of fresh air! I’m fine with the old, stale, instant
  coffee and resentment-scented air. Young people in the office sounds loud and
  tiring. But the office is becoming the new hype place to be! Maybe they’ll
  start queueing outside? Telling you your spreadsheet “ate” and complimenting
  your suits as “Severance core”? I doubt it. Didn’t another recent survey find
  only one in 10 young workers wanted to be in the office full-time? Yes, but
  even if they are only in a few days a week it would be fun. Just imagine the
  glow-up you’ll get by association: “Hi guys, get ready with me for the
  absolutely fire Q3 P&amp;L presentation!” GRWM for an afternoon of glaring at
  Dave eating sardines al desko again, more like. Hang on though – didn’t I read
  about gen Z just pretending to work when they are in the office? Erm, yes: in
  February, Fortune magazine explored the phenomenon of gen Z “task masking” at
  work – typing frenetically, or walking around pretending to take calls. A-ha!
  Well pretending to work is a time-honoured tradition. With a bit of
  mentorship, it sounds as if they’ll fit right in. I could teach them to walk
  around holding a piece of paper for hours, unchallenged! That’s the spirit.
  Sorry, “Slay, queen”. Do say: “The office provides lonely gen-Z workers with
  social interaction, support, intergenerational friendships and vital career
  mentorship …” Don’t say: “… But more importantly, free stationery and toilet
  roll.”
