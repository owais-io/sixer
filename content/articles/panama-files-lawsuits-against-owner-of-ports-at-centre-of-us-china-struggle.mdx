  Panama’s comptroller general has lodged two cases with the country’s supreme
  court against the owners of two ports at the centre of a geopolitical struggle
  between the US and China, in a move likely to be seen as a victory for Donald
  Trump in his attempt to rid the Panama canal of Chinese influence. The
  decision follows a failed attempt to sell the ports to a consortium headed by
  the US investment fund BlackRock and Swiss shipping firm MSC. The two ports,
  at each end of the Panama Canal, were originally awarded to the Hong
  Kong-based firm CK Hutchison in 1997. They entered the geopolitical spotlight
  on 20 January when Trump used his inauguration speech to vow he would “take
  back” the canal from supposed Chinese influence. The very same day, Anel
  Flores, the comptroller general, announced he would begin an audit of the
  ports’ owner, Panama Ports Company, in which CK Hutchison holds a 90% stake.
  In March, BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management company, announced
  it was working with MSC to acquire Panama Ports Company and 41 other ports in
  CK Hutchison’s global portfolio. The parties to the deal agreed a deadline of
  27 July to finalize details of the acquisition. But the sale of these
  strategic assets did not go down well in Beijing. On 28 March China’s
  anti-trust regulator said it would review the deal “to protect fair
  competition in the market and safeguard the public interest”. Earlier this
  month the Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese government had
  threatened to block the deal unless Cosco, a local shipping giant, was
  included as a veto-holding member of the takeover consortium. On Wednesday,
  Flores said that Panama Ports’ contract was “unfair” and “abusive”. He claimed
  that the company had not paid sufficient royalties to the government and that
  its 25-year extension, signed in 2023, was made without the necessary
  authorizations. One case lodged with the supreme court seeks to nullify the
  contract, the other seeks to declare it unconstitutional. In response to media
  speculation that Cosco would be included in the deal he said: “It doesn’t seem
  correct that in other [parts of the world] there are people negotiating the
  future of assets that belong to us, the Panamanians.” Panama’s president, José
  Raúl Mulino, said on Thursday, that he supported Flores’s decision – which he
  claimed had nothing to do with the ongoing struggle over the ports’ ownership.
  However, the timing of the announcement is convenient for the US-backed
  consortium. Should the court cases prove successful, the contracts for port
  operations would have to be re-tendered and, with Panama having exited China’s
  Belt and Road Initiative in April, it would seem likely the successful bid
  will come from a US firm or an ally country. Nullifying the PPC contract and
  re-tendering the operation of the ports would allow Panama to potentially
  redesign the contract terms to be more beneficial to the state. However, the
  country could also find itself exposed to litigation from CK Hutchison which
  could potentially argue it is tantamount to a politically motivated
  expropriation.
