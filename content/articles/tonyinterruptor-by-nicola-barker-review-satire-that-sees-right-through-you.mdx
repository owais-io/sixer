  As TonyInterruptor begins, musician Sasha Keyes is in the middle of an
  improvised trumpet solo. A man stands up in the audience and says, “Is this
  honest? Are we all being honest here?” He points at Sasha and adds, “You
  especially.” Soon a video of the episode appears online, with a companion clip
  of Sasha’s vitriolic reaction: “Some random fucking nobody … some dick-weed,
  small-town TonyInterruptor.” Given the times we live in, this naturally leads
  to Sasha’s trial by social media for artistic fraudulence and abusive conduct.
  But the shockwaves soon extend to everyone adjacent to the event: Fi
  Kinebuchi, the self-styled “Queen of Strings”, who was playing with Sasha at
  the time; India Shore, the teenager who posted the first video; India’s
  father, Lambert, an architecture professor with a secret crush on Fi
  Kinebuchi; his wife Mallory, who divides her time between parenting her
  daughter, Gunn, who has special needs, and venting intellectual spleen; and
  even to TonyInterruptor himself, real name John Lincoln Braithwaite, an
  otherworldly outsider whose “main occupation – his duty, even – is to observe
  and assess the falling and the catching of light”. The author of more than a
  dozen books, including the Goldsmiths prize winner H(a)ppy and the
  Booker‑shortlisted Darkmans, Barker is known for experiment and brainy whimsy.
  There could be no better person to write a comedy about art and its
  discontents. The novel is devastatingly on the money about the ways we’re all
  not being honest here: whether as flawed, self-conscious humans, or in the
  special case of artists, who strive harder for honesty and thus fall harder
  into affectation. Even the unworldly Braithwaite isn’t immune. What are we to
  make of a man who smokes because “smoking is a condensed and bastardised form
  of fire-watching”, and when asked to shake hands responds with, “I object to
  handshaking on ideological grounds … but you seem well-meaning so I’m happy to
  respond in the vernacular you’re most comfortable with.” Sincerity here is
  just the youthful illusion that we’re exempt from universal impostordom; or
  the lovely illusion of lovers that their inamorata is the one in a million who
  is really real. The characters’ sensitivity to the falseness all around them –
  and in them – gives them no peace. Lambert describes his wife, Mallory, as
  relentless in her criticisms, “like a seagull up to its knees in sea-swell,
  determinedly dissecting a crustacean as it rolls ceaselessly back and forth”.
  But this is true in various ways of all the characters, who are always finding
  fault. Sometimes this means railing at others, as when India tells her dad to
  “stop always making everything so … so INTELLECTUAL, so META … and just … just
  … for once in your life risk being real”. Sometimes they bemoan their own
  artificiality, as when Lambert conceives of himself as being “like a
  Moneymaker tomato: ripened to an unnaturally bright hue on a constant
  drip-diet of Baby Bio”. The prose is a profusion of thoughts and associations,
  and shadings of the thoughts, and metaphors extending from the associations.
  All this is delivered in long, manic sentences that love to chase their own
  tails. When we’re told Braithwaite is “like a leading character in a bad 1980s
  American capitalist drama (say Dallas: the over-indulged younger brother, the
  prodigal son who returns to the oilfield and promises his tough yet
  paradoxically indulgent slate-eyed, tan-faced father that he will learn the
  trade from the ground up; prove himself). But also like a character from an
  excellent, slightly clunky but extremely sincere first play about a
  demoralised primary school teacher who is struggling to nurture a gifted but
  troubled Irish Traveller child written by a 23-year-old northern prodigy whose
  uncle once ran (and possibly still runs) an abattoir” – well, are we really
  expected to parse all that? I suspect not. The excess is the joke, and the
  joke is sometimes on the reader who struggles to get anything as sensible as
  an image out of Barker’s imagery. It’s a rollercoaster kind of excess, where
  the best part is that it’s too much. Sometimes, I think, we’re being invited
  to enjoy the slapstick experience of losing our footing mid-sentence, and to
  join the laugh if we fall flat. Midway, the book takes a turn into romantic
  comedy, with a series of scenes where unlikely characters fall for each other.
  The honesty they’ve been pursuing, it turns out, consists not in improvised
  jazz, but in becoming besotted with an inappropriate person and blowing up
  your life. Barker manages this shift with an extraordinary lightness and
  perceptiveness, making it feel as though the rogue wave of love sweeping
  through her narrative was inevitable as soon as the words “Are we all being
  honest here?” were spoken. In a pivotal scene, a bewildered Sasha Keyes sums
  up all we’ve learned by citing the “Buddhist Lineage of Mis-steps”, in which
  it is the seeker’s mistakes and failings, not their spiritual achievements,
  that lead to enlightenment. It is a somehow fitting climax to a book in which
  Barker seems incapable of putting a foot wrong. This is satire that sees right
  through you, but forgives you and teaches you to forgive yourself. It’s that
  rare thing, a serious work of art that is also a giddy confection: a vehicle
  of pure delight. • TonyInterruptor by Nicola Barker is published by Granta
