  One of Japan’s most popular sports tournaments is reeling after the sudden
  withdrawal of a team whose teenage players have been accused of abusing a
  younger teammate. Koryo high school, which had been representing Hiroshima
  prefecture in the summer high school baseball championships, announced on
  Sunday it would no longer take part. The team’s withdrawal comes after a
  public outcry over reports that several of its members had physically abused a
  junior player earlier this year. The event’s organising body issued a severe
  reprimand to the school in March after its internal investigation found that
  four students had assaulted a younger boy at a dormitory in January. The
  revelations sparked a backlash on social media that included calls for the
  team’s expulsion, as well as a bomb threat and incidents in which Koryo
  students had been chased on their way to and from school. The summer
  tournament at Koshien stadium near Osaka features 49 teams and is one of the
  highlights of Japan’s sporting calendar, drawing huge attendances and TV
  audiences in the millions. The event, first held in 1915, has launched the
  careers of a string of famous Japanese baseball players, including the Los
  Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani. Koryo’s principal, Masakazu Hori,
  told reporters that the school had decided to withdraw to protect students and
  staff. Describing the assault case as “deeply regrettable”, he added: “We have
  decided to pull out, and will swiftly conduct an overhaul of our education
  method.” The school’s investigation found that the unnamed boy had been shoved
  in the chest and slapped in the face, Japanese media said. He transferred to
  another school after his assailants apologised. The school reported the
  incident to the federation, which issued a reprimand but did not initially
  make it public. Police are reportedly investigating the January incident after
  the victim filed a complaint, and a third-party body is examining additional
  allegations made by a former member of the team. The baseball team’s head
  coach, Tetsuyuki Nakai, has been relieved of his duties while the
  investigation is being carried out. The education minister, Toshiko Abe,
  voiced “deep regret” over the “inexcusable” actions of the students, but
  warned social media users not to post unfounded allegations against people
  connected to the school. It is not the first time that the tournament –
  Japan’s biggest amateur sporting event – has found itself at the centre of
  allegations of abuse, which critics claim lie in its refusal to ditch its
  regimented approach to sport. In 2015, PL Gakuen high school, one of the
  tournament’s most successful teams, said it would stop recruiting new players
  after allegations of violence and bullying. In 2023, the coach of another top
  team was forced to step down after being accused of physical abusing a player.
  And last month, players competing in a qualifying game for the Koshien
  tournament were ordered not to smile and wave at supporters during an opening
  ceremony, and instead march in an orderly fashion. The tournament’s organiser,
  the Japan High School Baseball Federation, said it would “continue efforts to
  eradicate violence, bullying and unreasonable hierarchical relationships”.
  Koryo, which has a tradition of producing professional players, is the first
  school in the tournament’s long history to withdraw after the games have
  started. The withdrawal means that Koryo will forfeit its second-round game,
  which had been scheduled for Thursday. In a clip on social media, several
  members of the team Koryo defeated in their first-round fixture last week
  refused to observe the custom of shaking hands with their opponents at the end
  of the game.
