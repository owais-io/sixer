  The past few weeks have seen a flurry of activity billed as progress in the
  Russia-Ukraine peace process. Yet for Ukrainians, the reality remains
  unchanged: airstrikes still thunder across their cities, homes still burn,
  lives are still lost. Against this grim backdrop, the Russian leader, Vladimir
  Putin, has seemed more than content to bask in the literal red-carpet
  treatment afforded by the president of the United States. Donald Trump, who
  has anointed himself mediator of this war, has nearly exhausted the lexicon of
  contradiction. Some days he proclaims that he alone can end this war. Then he
  insists that peace talks should be left to the two parties. At times he boasts
  that Putin “respects” him; at others, he castigates Putin for “going
  absolutely crazy”. This month, Trump vacillated between putting US troops on
  the table and ruling it out. Now he is reportedly considering using US private
  military firms for the job. For those watching – whether in Kyiv, Moscow,
  Washington or beyond – the effect is dizzying. Policy by improvisation is not
  strategy. And in a war where lives hang on the credibility of US commitments,
  unpredictability is not strength. It is abdication. So what is Trump doing,
  Nobel peace prize ambitions aside? Has he finally realised that Putin has no
  interest in a treaty that falls short of his maximalist goals? Or is this
  simply another chapter in a familiar playbook – headline chasing, image first,
  strategy later – where the costs will be borne not in Washington but on the
  streets of Kyiv? After a long learning curve, Trump may finally be realising
  that Putin has played him – that the two are not the close friends he once
  imagined. His repeated threats to impose new sanctions and tariffs on Russia
  are one example. Yet Trump has also shown time and again his willingness to
  forgive and forget, so long as Putin offers a new promise that this time
  things will be different. In the meantime, Ukraine appears to have found a
  workaround for direct US military aid, though one that comes at immense cost.
  With European financing, Kyiv can keep buying US weapons while Ukraine and the
  EU scale up production. It is hardly optimal, but it sustains the status quo:
  Ukraine survives, Trump claims credit for US arms profits, and Europe keeps
  Russia bogged down elsewhere. As long as this arrangement holds, the war will
  go on. Russia will continue to attack, but it will not defeat Ukraine. And in
  the absence of genuine US leadership, the conflict will persist as long as
  Putin can throw bodies forward. At the same time as Ukraine scrambles for
  survival, Putin is playing a different game altogether. He is the unlikely
  winner in this mayhem. Unable to seize an upper hand at the negotiating table
  through battlefield victories, he has fallen back on the tools that have
  served him for decades: obfuscation, manipulation and the grinding down of
  adversaries. Putin may not yet have secured everything on his wishlist, but he
  is nothing if not patient. Unlike democratic leaders, Putin faces no checks –
  only an inner circle of military and conservative elites with an imperialist
  worldview. To them, Ukraine is not just another territory to be bartered away
  to help boost Trump’s ego. It is the key to restoring Russia’s lost greatness.
  Putin also understands that US audiences crave clarity; they tire quickly of
  drawn-out talks and muddled messages. Fatigue becomes Putin’s ally. The
  tedium, the phone calls, the visits that go nowhere – these are not failures
  of diplomacy. They are the strategy. Once the war fades from headlines, his
  hope is to strike a bargain in the shadows: sanctions lifted, aid to Ukraine
  frozen. For Putin, every hour of confusion is an investment. The question is
  whether anyone else at the table has the stamina to see through it. The real
  loser in this, other than Ukraine, is Trump himself. For all his posturing, he
  risks selling himself short if his ambitions stop at a medal in Oslo. He
  imagines more – and he might even achieve it. If he emerges with a clear
  policy to end the war, this could be his Reagan moment: a chance to be
  celebrated as the saviour of the free world. Trump is not wrong that Joe Biden
  was too cautious to claim such a mantle. Trump, in contrast, could. Whether or
  not Putin personally respects him is debatable, but Putin does respect US
  military power. And there are options available, many well short of all-out
  war: the bipartisan Graham-Blumenthal bill, expanded air support, lifting
  missile restrictions and major increases in direct military aid, among others.
  Like any autocrat, Putin can be coerced. Biden was too timid to test that
  premise. Trump may not be. After all, unpredictability is his calling card.
  Should Trump force Putin to back down and end the war, he would secure a
  legacy as the unexpected hero. But if he allows Putin to dictate the outcome,
  the laurels will fall to Moscow. History will record not a peacemaker but a
  president who helped Russia, the US’s longtime adversary, reclaim its imperial
  standing while cementing the decline of US hegemony. Olga Chyzh researches
  political violence and repressive regimes. She is an associate professor in
  the Department of Political Science at the University of Toronto Do you have
