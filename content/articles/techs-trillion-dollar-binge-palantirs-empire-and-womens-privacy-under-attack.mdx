  Hello, and welcome to TechScape. This week, tech companies are spending
  amounts of money that stretch the limits of the imagination. Donald Trump’s
  administration is spending more money with data analytics and surveillance
  firm Palantir. And women on both sides of the Pacific face the extreme
  difficulty of keeping intimate moments private online. Update: the
  trillion-dollar AI race, part II In last week’s edition of the newsletter, my
  colleagues wrote about the upshot of Google’s earnings call: lots of money
  earned, but, more importantly lots of money spent on AI. Even more money
  shelled out than previously expected: Google revised its predictions for how
  much it would invest in building up its AI capacity upwards by billions.
  Investors loved it. Shares up. In the ensuing week, three more tech giants
  reported their quarterly earnings – Meta, Microsoft and Amazon – and disclosed
  that they have collectively spent $155bn. Investors expressed elation at the
  colossal sums. Meta’s market capitalization shot up by more than $130bn.
  Microsoft’s valuation soared past $4tn, making the software giant the second
  publicly traded company to reach that stratospheric milestone. Amazon’s
  financial outlook was murkier, and its shares went down. What a bummer to miss
  out on the AI stock party. The $155bn sum represents more than the US
  government has spent on education, training, employment and social services in
  the 2025 fiscal year so far. One economics research firm claims AI spending
  has contributed more to the US economy over the past two quarters than
  consumer spending, traditionally the biggest factor in economic growth. For
  the coming fiscal year, big tech’s total capital expenditure is slated to
  balloon enormously, surpassing the already eye-popping sums of the previous
  year. Microsoft plans to unload about $100bn on AI in the next fiscal year,
  CEO Satya Nadella said. Meta plans to spend between $66bn and $72bn. Alphabet
  plans to spend $85bn, significantly higher than its previous estimation of
  $75bn. Amazon estimated that its 2025 expenditure would come to $100bn as it
  plows money into Amazon Web Services, which analysts now expect to amount to
  $118bn. In total, the four tech companies will spend more than $400bn on capex
  in the coming year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Read more about the
  gargantuan sums of money being spent on AI. Where does Palantir have
  contracts? Last week, the US army announced a new agreement with Palantir, the
  Peter Thiel-founded, Alex Karp-run technology company. The agreement combined
  75 separate, existing contracts between the army and Palantir into one, and
  allows for the possibility to purchase goods and services up to $10bn. It’s
  just one of dozens of agreements between the company and the US, a
  relationship that’s only been growing rapidly in the second Trump
  administration, though it had been on the rise before then. Palantir brought
  in $373m in revenue from US government contracts in just the first quarter of
  2025 – $151.6m more than a year prior. The vast majority of that increase –
  $148.7m – came from government customers who were already working with the
  company, according to its earnings reports. Here’s an overview of Palantir’s
  biggest US government contracts: Department: Defense Worth: The Department of
  Defense lists its “obligations” to Palantir as $1.66bn in the government,
  which can encompass current and future spending, according to the US
  government’s database of its own spending. Financial analysts estimate
  Palantir earns $400m in annual recurring revenue from the DoD. The details:
  The DoD remains Palantir’s biggest and oldest customer within the US federal
  government. The first contract between the two dates back to 2008. The army
  has made no commitment and is under no obligation to purchase anywhere close
  to the $10bn figure listed as the value of its new agreement with Palantir,
  which represents the “maximum potential value of the contract”, according to
  the press release the government published. The number is not exactly money in
  hand for Palantir, but analysts seem encouraged it could represent a major
  source of revenue and more business from the US government. “It’s no
  obligation but we believe the army will spend billions with Palantir with this
  contract,” said Dan Ives, managing director at the wealth management firm
  Wedbush Securities. Department: Homeland Security Worth: $256.7m in
  obligations Details: The company has been working with the homeland security
  department since 2011. The vast majority of Palantir’s contracts with DHS are
  to provide services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. These
  amount to $248.3m in obligations. The company’s most recent contract with Ice
  was for $30m to make the deportation process more efficient. Department:
  Health and Human Services Worth: $385m in obligations Department: Treasury
  Worth: $140.9m Department: Justice Worth: $204.5m Department: Energy Worth:
  $91m Department: State Worth: $56.1m Department: Transportation Worth: $55.92m
  In the UK, Palantir has won a £330m contract with the National Health Service.
  Women the world over see their intimate messages and images exposed On both
  sides of the Pacific Ocean, women are being confronted with the difficulty of
  keeping their most personal moments private online. In the US, an app that
  pledged to make IRL dating safer has suffered a breach that may imperil its
  users. In China, hundreds of thousands of men are sharing explicit pictures
  without the consent of the women in the photos. The app in the US, Tea,
  offered a forum for women who subscribed to share past experiences with men so
  that other women could conduct DIY background checks on their prospective
  dates, highlighting negative “red flags” and positive “green flags”. Tea’s
  owners bill the app as “the safest place to spill”, in reference to the
  English slang term for gossip. It has topped US download charts in recent
  weeks, and the company has boasted about a user base of 1.6 million women. It
  is only available in the US. The app promised “dating safety tools that
  protect women”. but in late July, the company discovered that hackers had
  breached its systems and leaked users’ driver’s licenses, direct messages and
  selfies. Users of the noxious message board 4Chan screenshotted and spread Tea
  users’ personal information, according to NPR. A second breach exposed more
  than a million messages sent by Tea’s users, including ones about sensitive
  topics like abortions or cheating, per 404 Media, which first reported both
  breaches. The company claimed in a statement that the first breach only
  affected users who had signed up before February 2024, but the second one was
  much more recent, 404 reported. In response to the hack, the app has suspended
  messaging entirely, the BBC reported. Most data breaches inspire little public
  uproar. The exposure of an email address here, a birthday there can feel
  commonplace. The breach of Tea is different. The app promised safety as a core
  feature. It delivered the opposite. The sine qua non of a whisper network like
  Tea is privacy, the ability to share damning information in secret, which the
  app failed to protect. Exposing users’ identities and messages is the most
  basic type of failure, one that can be fatal to a product’s reputation. To
  make matters worse, the breach offers red meat to the male-dominated 4Chan
  forum, a node of incel culture and men’s rage in the US. “Our team remains
  fully engaged in strengthening the Tea app’s security, and we look forward to
  sharing more about those enhancements soon,” the company said in a statement
  to the BBC. “In the meantime, we are working to identify any users whose
  personal information was involved and will be offering free identity
  protection services to those individuals.” In China, women are facing down an
  online legion of men dedicated to invading their most private moments with spy
  cameras and sharing the results on the internet. My colleague Amy Hawkins
  reports: Anger is growing on Chinese social media after news reports revealed
  the existence of online groups, said to involve hundreds of thousands of
  Chinese men, which shared photographs of women, including sexually explicit
  ones, taken without their consent. The Chinese newspaper Southern Metropolis
  Daily published a report last week about a group on the encrypted messaging
  app Telegram called “MaskPark tree hole forum”. It said it had more than
  100,000 members and was “comprised entirely of Chinese men”. Men reportedly
  shared sexually explicit images of women either in intimate settings or with
  so-called “pinhole cameras” that can be hidden in everyday items such as plug
  sockets and shoes. Read the full story. In an influential 2014 essay, “Why
  women aren’t welcome on the internet”, the writer Amanda Hess said that
  receiving countless graphic death and rape threats in response to her work did
  not make her exceptional: “It just makes me a woman with an internet
  connection.” Events of the past week indicate that Hess’s headline still holds
  true. Tim Berners-Lee, credited with inventing the world wide web, told the
  Guardian in 2020 that the internet “is not working for women and girls”. The
  same year, a Unesco report found that 73% of women journalists endured online
  threats to their safety. Other UN reports have found that significant portions
  of women across the world, somewhere between 16% and 58%, face threats of
  gender-based violence online.
