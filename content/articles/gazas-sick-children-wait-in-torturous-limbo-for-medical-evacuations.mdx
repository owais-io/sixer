  Abdel Karim Wahdan no longer has the energy to speak. When visitors arrive,
  the eight-year-old pretends to be sleeping so that no one looks at him.
  Between his frequent dialysis sessions, he cries. His bones hurt, he says.
  Abdel Karim is dying. His death should be preventable but because he lives in
  Gaza he cannot access the treatment that would save his life. What started as
  acute kidney failure is now chronic: his small body has begun to swell and he
  spends his days between hospital beds and injections that he hates. “My son
  suffers greatly. The hospital has become his home. The doctors stand helpless
  and I can only watch and pray,” said his mother, Najwa Wahdan. As the sickness
  progressed, Abdel Karim was also diagnosed with malnutrition as food began to
  disappear from Gaza’s markets. His only hope is to be evacuated from Gaza to
  receive medical treatment abroad. Wahdan filed a medical referral four months
  ago but is still waiting. Abdel Karim is one of thousands of people in Gaza
  waiting for treatment abroad. Getting approved for a medical evacuation is a
  long, arduous process that can take years. Zahir al-Wehadi, the head of the
  information department at the Gaza ministry of health, said: “We have more
  than 16,000 patients [in Gaza] who need treatment abroad. We have already lost
  more than 600 patients who died while still waiting to travel.” Tens of
  thousands of people in Gaza have been wounded by Israeli strikes and gunfire
  over the past 22 months of a war that has killed more than 61,000 people.
  Disease and sickness, much of which were not present in Gaza prior to the war,
  are rife in the territory as solid waste accumulates and people live tightly
  packed together with limited access to clean water or hygiene products.
  Repeated Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals and Israel’s blockade of basic
  goods into the territory have left the medical sector devastated. Doctors in
  Gaza say that often they do not have the supplies to treat patients. In those
  cases they write a referral for the patients to be evacuated abroad. Israel
  controls who enters and leaves Gaza. People who need medical treatment abroad
  must have their exit approved by Cogat, the Israeli military agency in charge
  of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians. In December, the World Health
  Organization said the pace of medical evacuations out of Gaza was so slow that
  it would take five to 10 years to clear the backlog. Cogat has been approached
  for comment. Waiting for medical evacuation is torturous. Patients and their
  families have no ability to speed up the process and can do nothing but hope
  that approval comes before death does. During their long wait, Abdel Karim’s
  physical and mental state has deteriorated. He has lost the ability to walk
  and when his blood pressure drops too low he temporarily goes blind and has
  seizures. “What I loved most about Abdel Karim was his calmness; he never
  caused trouble like other children,” his mother said. “He loved studying
  Arabic and English. He once wanted to become a doctor.” But the months of
  sickness have taken its toll on the once happy child. “For the last three
  months he has been withdrawn, irritable, yelling often and not speaking to
  anyone – this is not the calm son I knew before,” Wahdan said. Many children
  have died while waiting for their evacuation approval. Amina al-Jourani was
  not too worried when in January 2024 her 15-year-old son, Nidal, came home
  with a foot injury. Israel had bombed a nearby house and Nidal had gone to the
  scene to help transport wounded people to the hospital on his bicycle. When he
  returned to his home he had a small gash on his foot. “At first we didn’t pay
  it much attention. It seemed like a simple, ordinary wound,” Jourani said. But
  in the following days Nidal developed a fever. He began to lose weight and his
  skin was covered with red spots. It was a year and a half before doctors
  approved a request to transfer Nidal abroad, as his condition, though
  persistent, did not seem to be life-threatening. The hospital he was staying
  in, the European hospital, was bombed and he was sent home. His fever spiked
  and his foot turned blue. Nidal went to another hospital where they diagnosed
  him with kidney failure. He died two days later, on 2 June 2025. Doctors say
  it is impossible to deal with the caseload, particularly as the humanitarian
  situation has worsened since Israel instituted a harsh blockade of aid on Gaza
  in March. Aid groups have said a worst-case famine scenario is unfolding in
  Gaza. Israel denies there is a starvation crisis in Gaza and says the UN is to
  blame for poor distribution of aid – a claim that aid bodies uniformly reject.
  Ragheb Warsh Agha, the head of the gastroenterology department at al-Rantisi
  children’s hospital, said: “Many children die because of the lack of resources
  or the lack of response to transfer requests. In many cases the child’s
  treatment is simple – for example, we may need basic medicines, specific
  treatments that are unavailable, or to conduct tests for which the necessary
  equipment does not exist.” Agha said the overcrowded hospital often had to
  place three children in a single bed, which encouraged the spread of disease.
  Gaza’s starvation crisis has also meant disease spreads more easily. Lack of
  food weakens people’s immune systems and makes them more susceptible to
  sickness. Recovery is more difficult when the body does not have food. For
  parents waiting for the mechanisms of bureaucracy to give them the slip of
  paper that means life for their children, the helplessness is agonising.
  Jourani said: “At the height of his illness, Nidal gave me 100 shekel he had
  saved and he told me: ‘Mom, keep this for me so I can buy lots of sweets,
  chocolate and snacks when the [border] crossing opens.” Two and a half months
  after Nidal’s death, his mother received a message: his referral had been
  approved, his request to be evacuated granted. “Nidal died and the money is
  still in my purse,” she said through tears. “He died waiting for the crossings
  to open.”
