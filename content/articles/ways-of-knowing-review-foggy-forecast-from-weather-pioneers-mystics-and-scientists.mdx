  scientists

  Clara Potter-Sweet and Ben Kulvichit give every impression of having something
  to say. The two performers of Emergency Chorus open with a curious duet,
  striking a series of poses like human semaphore signs. Hard to know what it is
  all about, but it is the start of the show and they do it with poise and
  concentration so you give them the benefit of the doubt. Indeed, things then
  seem to come into focus with a scene about barometers and the pioneering days
  of weather forecasting. The Victorians knew they were on to something when
  they realised they could measure changes in air pressure, but it took time to
  interpret the signs. A jokey scene much later on, in which Potter-Sweet plays
  an earnest and garrulous interviewer at a science conference quizzing
  Kulvichit as a taciturn, long-bearded mystic hermit, confirms Ways of Knowing
  is about attempts to predict the future. But this raises two questions. One is
  what the intervening scenes are supposed to add. There is a vigorous dance
  sequence in which the two stamp out a syncopated beat for rather a long time,
  which could mean anything, and a gloomy section crawling around a coal mine –
  a reference, perhaps, to deep time and the bedding down of carbon over
  centuries. Or perhaps not. The other question is, even if we could puzzle out
  a meaning from this deliberate collision of scenes and styles, what do
  Potter-Sweet and Kulvichit have to say about it? It is true that in this time
  of climate emergency, artists find it hard to conceive of a future. But this
  introspective show, one of the winners of the 2025 Underbelly Untapped award,
  seems nervous about even doing that much. Yes, predicting the future is a
  fool’s errand, but so what? At Underbelly, Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 24 August
