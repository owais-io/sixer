  The saying goes “curiosity killed the cat”, as if being nosy is a bad thing.
  As I stood knee-deep in the cool Atlantic Ocean, marvelling at the beauty and
  emptiness of the Plage de Port Lin, I decided this was nonsense: without this
  little detour, “just to have a look”, I’d never have discovered Le Croisic, on
  the Guérande peninsula. The downside is that time isn’t on my side: it’s past
  5pm and I’m supposed to be at the big resort, La Baule-Escoublac, six miles
  east by now. But the presqu’île (a “nearly island”), as the French call it,
  tucked in the corner where Brittany meets Pays de la Loire, is calling out to
  be explored. First, though, a late afternoon dip in the sea is too hard to
  resist, and I wade into the water, sharing a delighted smile with fellow
  swimmers. Two elderly women in flowery swimming caps nod a cheery “Bonsoir” as
  I take my first strokes. Afterwards, I wander up the coast a little way. A row
  of belle epoque villas overlook the rocky coastline, and I climb down on to
  the sand in front of them to look west at the enchanting view of the small
  headlands jutting into the sea and scattered black rocks in silhouette. Back
  in the car, I hazard that I have just enough time to do a circuit of the
  peninsula if I delay my evening dinner reservation in La Baule, and so I
  follow the coast road west, spotting menhirs, small sandy coves and a golf
  course along the way. As I approach the town of Le Croisic, there are more
  people out for a stroll beneath the towering maritime pine trees and I park up
  again to join them for a while. At the jetty that usually sees passengers
  boarding the foot ferry to the islands off the coast, such as Belle-Île-en-Mer
  and Hoëdic, I notice a crowd of people aren’t queueing, but fishing. Old men
  and teenage boys are peering over the railings, with nets lowered down on
  lines; there’s a jolly camaraderie and their chatter carries on the breeze. In
  the sea behind them, I spot the Trehic jetty, an 850-metre stone pier that
  snakes into the bay nearby – its end point marked by a lighthouse – as well as
  the tip of the Pen Bron peninsula on the other side of the bay, which seems so
  close it could be within swimming distance. Its proximity reminds me what the
  two peninsulas embrace: 2,000 hectares (4,940 acres) of marshland and the salt
  ponds from which the famous Guérande salt crystals are harvested. The thought
  of sprinkling it on my dinner makes my stomach rumble, and so I head on to La
  Baule, taking a detour through the main town, along the pretty harbour front
  with its yachts and quaysides. After checking into the Hotel des Dunes, I
  wander out for dinner. There’s a holiday vibe in the town and restaurants are
  full of families and friends dining together, black-clad waiters whirling
  between them with trays aloft. I arrive for my reservation at Restaurant Le M
  (starter, main course and dessert from €18.90), and tuck into briny oysters
  from Brittany and grilled fish with Mediterranean vegetables. La
  Baule-Escoublac first welcomed tourists in the late 19th century, after the
  opening of the railway line, and became a sophisticated resort. Today, it is a
  mix of modern apartments, belle epoque-era timber-framed architecture, cafes,
  restaurants and souvenir shops. Away from the main drags are desirable
  19th-century villas shaded by the cypress and pines that were planted in the
  early 1820s to stabilise the dunes. It is undeniably touristy, but that’s no
  surprise for a place with such a good beach. The next morning, I wander down
  to the seafront and inhale the ozone before wandering along the shore, sitting
  for a while on the golden sand. Some 15 minutes north of La Baule-Escoublac is
  impressive Guérande – its name familiar from the eponymous salt – with its
  mighty walls, towers, moats and grand medieval gate, La Porte Saint-Michel.
  Inside, it is a delight: bunting flutters above streets packed with bakeries,
  arty boutiques and creperies. The sun is shining, so I take a table in the
  main square on the terrace of the creperie Chez Lucien and soon I’m tucking
  into a crispy golden galette complète, with ham, cheese and a gooey egg at its
  centre, and a cup of cider. I might strictly be in the region of Pays de la
  Loire, but the identity here is resolutely Breton, and the salt harvested from
  the nearby marshes has been a key ingredient in Brittany’s famous salted
  butter for centuries. To find out more about the fascinating process of
  harvesting the sel de Guérande, I head out to the marshes. At the shop and
  visitor centre of the Terre de Sel cooperative (salt marsh tours from €10.50),
  I meet Simon Pereon, a paludier or salt harvester, who has agreed to show me
  how he and his 220 fellow paludiers enact the process of salt harvesting
  between June and September. Salt has been prized in these parts since Roman
  times, when soldiers were sometimes paid in salt (hence the origin of the word
  salary), but the marshes as we see them today date from around 1,000 years
  ago. As we drive to Simon’s ponds, I start to see the appeal of working under
  the big skies and open air, and the reason he followed in his father’s and
  grandfather’s footsteps. “The government classes us as ‘farmers’,” he
  explains, “but we work with seawater and the whole landscape is balanced
  between the land and the sea.” With a long, toothless rake called a las, he
  moves the seawater between a labyrinth of shallow rectangular ponds that don’t
  drain, due to the clay mud beneath, coloured pink by the algae that thrives
  here. As the water moves between each pond it becomes increasingly
  concentrated as the sun evaporates the water and leaves the salt behind. Simon
  sweeps the las across the ponds and the water ripples gently: the process is
  hypnotic. By the end of each day, he has raked the salt into neat piles on the
  dykes between ponds. “In summer, we harvest 50kg every day. The job has
  evolved over the years, with tractors and other machines, but for the actual
  salt harvesting, we still use the identical process that’s been around for
  centuries.” The tranquillity has been passed down the ages: I hear little more
  than the calls from the avocets and ibis in the neighbouring lagoon. “I start
  at daybreak,” Simon says, “and for the first few hours of the day, I see the
  sun rise, listen to the birds, and there’s no one around. At the end of the
  day, too, I just watch the sun go down.” It sounds like bliss and, after I
  take another detour later that day through the salt marshes – the clouds in
  the reddening sky are reflected in the mirror-like ponds – I am reassured that
  curiosity can only be a good thing. The trip was provided by Pays de la Loire
  Tourism; accommodation provided by Hotel des Dunes in La Baule (doubles from
  €65 room-only). Brittany Ferrieshas crossings from Portsmouth to St Malo from
  £229 return for a car and two people, including en suite cabin on the outward,
