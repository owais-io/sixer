  Every day, new images come from Gaza that depict the most unimaginable
  horrors: hunger, despair and murder. It’s rare to see a glimmer of hope in
  this unrelenting suffering, but last week a video posted by Stephanie Shih, of
  fresh vegetables being purchased from one of the few remaining family farms in
  the Gaza Strip, provided one. Sadly, the prices were astronomical – sometimes
  as much as $40 for a few eggplants. Since Israel has stopped almost all food
  and aid getting into Gaza, prices of what little food has been grown,
  stockpiled or looted have soared. The fresh vegetables could be purchased
  thanks to a mutual aid fund run by Shih, an artist based out of New York. Shih
  has raised over $600,000 since March 2024 from a fund she runs from her
  Instagram and word of mouth. Half of the money goes to a photojournalist in
  Gaza with a history of community work, who helps organise distributions of
  cooked food, produce, water, tents, cloth and cash. “He’s able to leverage his
  longstanding relationships with local vendors to get decent deals on what
  little product is available in the markets, which is then distributed for free
  to families who cannot afford it,” Shih said. The funds enabled him to buy the
  vegetables and pass them on to other families. The other half of the money is
  given to about 30 families in Gaza that Shih has developed close relationships
  with since 2024. Shih is one of a number of individuals and groups based in
  the US who have set up uncertified and unofficial mutual aid funds for people
  in Gaza. The funds solicit donations from all over the world. Some are working
  with Palestinians in Gaza to organise complex distribution networks, others
  are simply wiring money directly to trusted individuals in Gaza to distribute.
  Just this week, Reviving Gaza, a mutual aid group founded by three displaced
  Gazan siblings, posted videos of 1,500 loaves of fresh bread being baked with
  flour secured by their group. This kind of distribution is often uneven and
  not nearly enough to sustain the population of Gaza. The amount they can raise
  is also limited by personal networks and social media followers. Yet for
  people living under the most unimaginably horrific conditions, these donations
  can be a lifeline. Since the beginning of the war, aid has been severely
  restricted – only a small number of aid trucks are allowed into Gaza and
  what’s allowed in is heavily controlled by Israel. But things got considerably
  worse in March, when Israel enacted a total blockade on all food, aid and
  medicine into Gaza. The small amount of aid still being distributed by the
  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US-and Israeli-backed group, comes with great
  risk: Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians at its food
  distribution sites since May. Earlier this month more than 100 charities wrote
  an open letter to say that they were seeing Palestinians, including their own
  colleagues, wasting away as famine grips Gaza. The letter blamed Israeli
  restrictions on, and “massacres” at, aid distribution points. Israel’s foreign
  ministry says it is now allowing in about 70 aid trucks a day – well below the
  500 to 600 trucks the UN says are needed and that entered daily during a
  six-week ceasefire earlier this year. “On a given day when an NGO has to shut
  down highly visible operations because of military threats, fundraisers like
  ours can still operate,” says Shih. “But those NGOs could be up the very next
  day serving more people than our small team could handle. NGOs have more money
  and resources but are also bound by international bureaucracy and political
  tensions. Mutual aid groups are more nimble, have less overhead and are able
  to distribute moderate amounts of aid quickly.” While some mutual aid funds
  are being run by individuals like Shih, others are small collectives that
  focus on certain kinds of aid – like Water is Life, which sources water from
  wells in northern Gaza and, with the help of donations, pays for trucks to
  distribute it around the strip. Mutual Aid Funds says that in the past few
  weeks interest and donations have soared as more images of starvation and
  Israeli violence reach western media. Grassroots Gaza is a fund run by a large
  number of Palestinians who now live abroad. “Donations are a lifeline in these
  catastrophic times,” said a co-founding member, who asked not to be named.
  “For example, we’ve been sending clean water trucks to al-Naser in north Gaza
  for months. And we chose this area precisely because it’s a residential
  neighborhood, not a camp or UN school, and is often overlooked by large NGOs
  and international aid initiatives.” Notably, these funds use existing networks
  and wire transfers to get money to Gaza, avoiding platforms like GoFundMe
  which has frozen or returned millions of dollars raised on its platform meant
  to reach Gaza. But once money reaches Gaza, some brokers are charging 40% fees
  to get cash. These fees are a big part of the reason people can’t afford food.
  Many merchants used to accept digital transfers, but no longer. Virtual money
  is losing value because it has to be converted to cash at some point. Food
  prices are changing constantly, but Tamar Glezerman, who fundraises via Venmo
  with the help of a friend in Gaza, says prices last week were 1,100 shekels
  ($324) for 10kg of flour, 200 shekels ($59) for canned sardines and 54 shekels
  ($15) for wet wipes. That’s not to say mutual aid groups can account that
  every dollar they raise is spent in the most effective way. Grassroots Gaza
  acknowledges the emergence of “black markets, skyrocketing prices, and
  exploitative merchants” but says that it is not the fault of those sending
  money and “is directly linked to and engineered by the ongoing genocidal war”.
  Many financial operators also saddle huge surcharges on money being sent to
  Gaza. “Everything we do is carried out and organized under siege, bombardment,
  starvation, and abandonment by the international community and neighboring
  countries. Nothing about this moment is perfect, and yet we continue to
  provide rooted in care, accountability, and love to our people,” said the
  group’s spokesperson. Yesterday, as she was about to send more money, Shih got
  a heartbreaking reply from one of the families she regularly donates to: “I
  think there is no need for that. We will not be able to use this money for
  anything. The situation is very bad and the prices are very high. This is the
  last thing I ever expected to say in my life.” Shih says she will continue to
  send funds to the family, but the only way to help every Palestinian in Gaza
  is with an immediate ceasefire and open borders. “If there was enough food to
  feed the people of Gaza, there would be no black market. Flour didn’t cost 120
  shekels a kilo before the genocide. Israel is manufacturing the starvation of
  Gaza and then pointing to people’s desperation as proof of their depravity,
  but the depravity is Israel’s alone.”
